2,Almost Right,"The solar lights are sufficient, however, the issues I had were with the black and clear alpha and numeric characters that come with the sign. There are insufficient quanities for a four didget house i.e. 1234 there is only one black plackard when two are needed. I had to use a black electrical tape to blockout one numeric character to balance the sign. The numeric characters are not easy to put in place and one has already (after a month) slipped and needs to be reapplied. Im thinking of super glue to hold those numbers in place. Had I not had a good discount I would not have purchased this item, nor would I recommend it to others for the reasons I've stated"
3,Worth the money,"The product looks good and works well. The numbers are harder to position than they should be. There should be an easier way to secure them in place. I am still happy with the purchase, and think it is worth what I paid for it."
4,Monique Parent is the ULTIMATE femme fatale!,"Monique Parent is the ultimate femme fatale in VICIOUS KISS. This erotic thriller has real bite thanks to great performances from Monique as a psycho black widow, Margaux Hemingway (in her last film role) and cult actress Maria Ortiz as a biker girl. There are lots of unexpected twists to keep you guessing. Also look for one very mean doberman!"
3,average,hull cleaner works well but does not clean as well as i thought. product is good when used after boat is out of the water right away. thank you
4,"Removed the majority, but.....","...not all of the waterline. Granted, I have an old boat that wasnt maintained very well over the years. The water/scum is part of the boat now it appears. For those with a newer boat that it isnt too late to maintain, I would recommend this product. It removed the first layer of scum with no problem, when other cleaners didnt do a thing."
1,Star brite Hull Cleaner,"After reading the reviews for this item, I thought it was supposed to be amazing....however, we used the product as instructed and there was no change in our boat. I think 409 or any cleaner would have worked as well. Our boat was not that dirty - we take it out of the lake every week-end, but it did need to be cleaned. I wouldn't purchase this product again!"
1,Didn't even make a dent,I will try to post a picture but Starbrite didn't remove anything from the hull of my boat. I had the boat sitting in the Fox River for only six weeks during which it built up a bunch of algae discoloration on the hull. The back boat corners were the worse. I sprayed this stuff on three separate times. Each time I let it sit like the directions say and then rinsed off. The hull looks exactly the same it didn't work at all.
4,Good product,Used it on my boat and i was very pleased with the results. I think it may be a little over pumped online but i would recommend it.
4,Great Value for the Money,Bought this fixture to go over entry door to garage. Like it so much bought one to match for back porch. Appears to be made of high-quality materials especially in comparison to cost.
4,Exactly as advertised,"This is a decent fixture with a reasonable price. Other than it being gray(I painted mine white) I have no complaints. The rubber gasket(not foam) is 1/4"" thick and is cut precisely so it is almost impossible to get a bad seal.Note to DIYers:This fixture comes with a watertight box, aka a ""Bell box"" It is designed to fit that type of box, not a recessed standard box. If this confuses you, call an electrician."
4,Good quality light fixture,"I purchased and installed three of these lights for use under my deck. The light fixtures are well made, waterproof and rugged. I had no issues with the installation and would definitely purchase again."
5,Industrial Look,Ordered three of these lights for my house. Looks just like the picture. Easy to install and the quality is good.
5,Very good beginner book to derivatives,I would definitely recommend this book for a reader who is looking for some ground work to be laid within the world of derivatives. Durbin gives a simple introduction into the many different types of derivatives; however he will delve into the math behind some derivatives; if the reader is not interested he will let you know which mathematics heavy sections you can skip. I would read another book written by Michael Durbin.
4,"Easy to Read, Good Intro to the topic.","The Text from my college course is pale in comparison, this is a much more enjoyable read. I can't be too critical because I don't know much about this industry but from what I've read til now, I'm really liking it."
2,This set sucked.,as a former Magic the Gathering player this set sucked please do not purchase these cards as you will be very disappointed in them
2,not the greatest resource,"I was given this book as a new hire in the media department of an ad agency. Gee, thanks. Way to thoroughly confuse a newbie! The book is very redundant and does not really explain how to relate the principals to real life practice."
3,Not as good as Selected Stories,"I read Dancing After Hours immediately after I read Selected Stories by Andre Dubus. I found Dancing After Hours not as enjoyable. It seemed to meander and was not as concise as ""Selected"". By being able to compair the two, I probabally gave this book a disservice, because the ability of this man to flat out write is undeniable."
2,:(,"Had to review this book for class. I don't want to say I really hated it, but I did. I've read other stuff from this author and enjoyed it but this book just annoyed me."
4,Characters bring life experiences with them.,"All stories are about people at least thirty who at the time of the stories bring all the good and bad fortunes of their past to play on their current situation. Many are about falling up from a low point. Andre Dubus's own life experiences give him first hand knowledge of situations his characters are found in.PS I ordered this as a used book listed as ""very good"" condition. It was in fact in very poor condition."
1,Adolescent Waste of Time and Paper,"This has to be one of the worst books I have ever read. You go from story to story hoping that the next one will be engaging or interesting, but it never happens. Each of the stories in this book could have just have easily come from a 15 year old writing English assignments who also happens to have a bizarre fascination with bowel movements and bodily functions in general. In summary, truly awful. Don't waste your time or money on this one. Keep looking."
1,No Chronological Order,"My biggest complaint about the book: it has no chronological order. After 30 pages I simply lost interest and gave up. When i'm reading a biography, I expect to be through with childhood and adolescence by page 30 and then to finally read the stuff that's actually much more interesting, his career, his love life, the famous people Grant met in his life etc.Now I will check if there's another Cary Grant biography out there."
2,How authentic can it be?,"The author can't even describe Grant's movies accurately (in one glaring example, he describes Grant's character in ""The Bachelor and the Bobby Soxer"" as a high school teacher, and in another, he asserts that Cary Grant's character is married to Deborah Kerr's character in ""Dream Wife,"" obviously having missed the first chunk of the movie where Kerr keeps postponing their wedding because of her schedule). Why should anyone believe anything else he says?Flowery prose that has little to do with fact. I'm sorry I paid money for this book"
4,A success story,"This man escaped from the underbelly of existence in England only to have to land on it again in the U.S.. I have never seen one of his movies and did not know he was an orphan surviving through Vaudeville acts an an early age. He was bridled with blind luck, ambition, illusion, good looks and despair all at once. He created something out of minus nothing. He managed to rise above it all. The people that came to leech off of him and build a cottage industry on his misery are still profiting. It is easy to forgive his every transgression when understanding the challenges he faced and rose above. This was a gripping read."
1,lack of credible sources,"I feel this author did not back his biography up with qoutes or sources to assume the things he says about Grant, such as Grant being a male prostitute! I feel it was like sitting in a beauty parlor listening to all the gossip about Cary Grant and no one really having hard evidence. I feel so bad for his family and fans who love him reading this. I just wanted to know more about Cary Grant being in my 20s. Why ruin a good thing!"
2,Disappointing,"There wasn't enough input from primary sources in this book - interviews with, and direct quotes from, family and friends - to make it antyhing resembling a definitive biography. The details that were provided came off sounding more like heresay than fact, and there was more pop psychology in this than seemed appropriate. The author came across as extremely knowledgeable about Grant's movies, but then got some key details wrong (as noted in detail by other reviewers) but the rest of it seemed like it was written from the outside looking in, which undermined the credibility of the book. The photo on the front was the best part!"
1,A piece of Cary Grant fan fiction,"I could write a lengthy review of this book, but the fact that I frequently find myself looking to see how many pages are left should say a lot about what I think of the book. It regularly becomes a tedious read and is filled with so much conjecture and psychoanalytical nonsense that it starts to read like a piece of fantasist fan fiction. Early on in the book the author, Eliot, mentions that there is almost nothing known about Grant's activities during a couple years during Grant's early twenties, but that doesn't stop Eliot, who is all too happy to use guesswork to fill in the gaps. As such, it's hard to continue reading when the author pretty much comes out and tells you directly that he's making stuff up.I'd look elsewhere in my quest to find out more about Cary Grant."
2,Where's the proof?,"The author claims that Cary Grant had serious love/sexual affairs with male clothing designer (for years at Warner Bros.) Orry-Kelly and actor Randolph Scott. Where's the proof? The author offers not one shred of evidence; it's all innuendo.To the author's credit, he does offer some interesting background stories and information on many of Grant's movies. Especially effective is info on many of Grant's earlier and lesser known movies. However, even here the author falls short, as he barely mention's one of Cary Grant's very best movies, His Girl Friday with Rosalind Russell (1940). There are other more worthy biographies of Cary Grant; this one should be avoided."
5,A must-have book,"I picked this up in a bookstore and glanced through it, thinking it was too wordy and verbose. The I broke down and bought it on amazon. The phrase ""I couldn't put it down,"" has been used to death in amazon reviews, but that's a perfect description of this bio. In fact, I found it irritating because I really couldn't put it down. Well-written and even-handed, this is a must have for anyone intersted in Hollywood and/or Mr. Grant.This is not some tell-all book, but the author doesn't pull any punches and is totally honest about Grant's sexual orientation and his ""marriages.""Normally when I read a bio of a star whose movies I adore, I find that I can no longer look at that star with the same respect, i.e. Joan Crawford or Bette Davis. Not so with Mr. G. I have a new-found respect for him. Was he perfect? Far from it, but he was very human and much more genuine than the majority of Hollywood.Highly recommended along with ""The Man who Invented Rock Hudson."""
1,Bad,"Cary Grant: A BiographyI am almost through with this book (2/3).There are far too many footnotes, references to other books, and research.I do not have any ""REAL"" idea about Cary, as much as I have of his career.If you are looking to find out about him, I suggest a book he was an actual part of.Not this posthumous glance back at the persona, that WAS him.In other words, don't waste your money!!"
4,Great book to help rid night time scares.,"My children (4 and 2) loved this book. We checked it out at the library on a fluke and it came in handy. They have been scared of shadows at bedtime but when I remind them of the story they are not scared. It is a fun book to read and also helps with night time scares! It teaches them that shadows are just friendly shapes of items in their room like a hat, their bed etc. Good choice."
4,Seems to work,"Documentation could use some work. In particular, the simple question of how does one set the clock after putting the batteries in.After looking thru all the text I finally found it.So to save you some time here's what you do:Put in the batteries, place it in an area where the signal strength is good. Leave it there overnight for it to set itself- now why couldn't they just say that as the first thing in the documentation????The other way to set the clock is to use the manual settings - read instructions.Projection appears to be good and readable in the dark. In early morning light it is rather faint."
1,Weed eater can't build an engine that runs!,"I threw out the last two Weed eater brand trimmers I had because I could not keep them running, IF they started.I used this one 3 months before it quit. It runs, for a while, with full chock on! Dies instantly when taken off.I WILL NEVER, NEVER, NEVER BY ANOTHER ONE FROM WEEDEATER!"
1,piece of crap,"My girlfriend has had this trimmer for 2 years, and it started giving her trouble right out of the box. She said she thought it was just her inexperience, but that wasn't it.As many other said..it's difficult to start, and runs terribly. The string is a huge pain to keep feeding and re-spool, and it won't stay running unless you run it full throttle, which is incredibly noisy. It also started smoking this season. And at this time, the shaft won't spin. That's happened several times as well.She's gonna look for a new trimmer asap. We might just set this thing on fire soon.I'd give it 0 stars if I could. This trimmer doesn't have a single redeeming quality."
4,lite and easy,"excellent product for the homeowner, light and easy to use yet powerfull enough for any job the average homeowner will run into."
1,SST25 FeatherLite Defective design -- always cuts out for no reason,"This is one sure fire way to waste hundred bucks or so. Runs at first when you buy it. Soon you find that it starts cutting out, just when you thought it was running fine. I think it stops working once it is hot, and soon that happens after just 3 or 4 minutes of use. No point discussing other features. I note that it looks nice from the outside; nice colors, everything would make you think they must know how to design something. However it seems to me that it must be a deliberate rip off. Tell the store you bought it from to discontinue sourcing it. Then remember that enemy you had when you were a kid, pretend you are making nice finally. Give it to him/her as a gift!"
1,Arrived with Broken Choke Lever,"This item arrived with a broken choke lever, so I sent it back. I went to Home Depot and bought a HomeLite weed wacker/edger, which I am happy with."
2,Bad customer service,"This is a product of Electrolux-Husqvarna Group. I was injured in July when the motor fell off the shaft and the cable wrapped around (and cut) my arm.I have since been on the phone and waiting for responses for nearly two months. This is the second time this has happened--beyond just shipping another trimmer, the customer service and followup are indifferent and uncaring. Customer ""service"" is NOT."
2,Will not stay running - dies after 5 minute,"This FeatherLite 25cc WeedEater is great when its working!! Runs for approx 5 minutes then dies, and cannot get it started again until the following day. I have changed the spark plug, new fuel, blew out the lines, etc....Can't say that I am overly impressed with it."
4,Ok weed eater,Starts right up but problem we have is the line it came with. It keeps getting stuck will not extend out. Once I get it going works great but the line keeps getting stuck. I would probably get a different line for it. after fixing it it works great for the price. It is very light and easy to handle.
3,Replaced Fuel Lines After Two Years,"I had to replace the fuel lines after two years of use. There was a leqk in one of the fuel lines and they appeared to be disintegrated. This is not acceptable. I only gave it 3 stars because it has been reliable and easy to start after replacing the fuel lines. Typically, I don't even have to squeeze the throttle. Just the momentum of the idle speed is enough torque to cut through grass along the edge of the lawn, etc.."
1,STAY AWAY FROM THIS WEEDEATER,"I've had the same problems as those describe. Wont start, wont idle, and wont run. I've tried operating it three times on different occasions and have had nothing but trouble keeping it going if I can get going in the first place."
4,Weed Eater FLSST25 gas trimmer,"I am very pleased with this trimmer. The straight shaft allows trimming under shrubs, and hedges easier than curved shafts and fits tall operators better. The .080 line is durable and the spool is easy to maintain. Being lightweight allows me to finish trimming quickly and with less fatigue.This model appears to be identical to a Craftsman model#79101, priced similarly, but this one has a much better warranty.Carefully following the starting directions is advised, as it takes several pulls when cold, and with no clutch the trimmer head spins whenever the engine is on. The good part about the trimmer head spinning at idle is that it saves fuel on the light duty trimming."
5,wkh weed eater review,"Shipping was quick. Assembly was easy; however, the shaft was considerably bent during shipping but not kinked so I was able to straighten it without much problem.The Weed Eater starts easily and does a very good job of doing what it is supposed to do. It is quite a bit more effective and powerful than I expected it to be. I am tempted to buy another one for my lake place."
4,Weed Eater 25CC Gas Straight Shaft String Trimmer,"Quality product for the price. Light and plenty of power for up to medium trimming chores. Only downside is design which makes starting less desirable than some other models on the market. If trimmer in sitting on ground while starting, trimmer rotates or spins causing either line to expel or chunking on surface causing engine to die out. It is a little to heavy to hold and pull the starter line at the same time. While not the best arrangement, trimmer is still a good buy."
1,starting,"After 5 days of effort I gave up on starting it and called customer service.They gave me a dealer- repair shop name and number that would honor the guarantee. The shop they gave me would not give me a time estimate on how long repairs would take. I ask,would three months be enough time. No I can not promise that the gentleman said. I must take care of my customers first. I do not recommend buying this item if you live in a small town as I do.Warranty repair work may be non existant."
2,Difficult To Start,"I've used the unit 4 times and on each occasion it was very difficult to start ( 40 to 50 pulls per event). I've not been able to find ""the trick"" for starting this particular engine.It is more difficult to start than all of the many 2 cycle engine devices I've owned over my 64 years (i.e. outboards, lawn mowers, blowers, edger's, line trimmers, chain saws, etc.)Once started it does a great job."
1,Don't waste your money,"Immediately upon receiving this product I assembled it, gassed it up, and pulled the starter. It started right away! Only problem, it would not STAY running!! I messed with it for about 20 minutes before finally giving up and calling the 800 number.After a wait of seven minutes a customer rep told me the problem was the carburetor. The carburetor was not ""Adjusted"" for my area (Ohio). I would have to take it to a repair shop. This product was just minutes out of the box!!!An email to the company confirmed that the most likely culprit was the carb and that some areas of the country have this problem."
1,garyl,"Don't waste your money or time. I bought this weedeater from amazon.com. I received it within a few days. It has never been used because it would only run on half choke & would not idle. I called the 800#, they said take to the repair shop where it resides now. I was told that I may get it back in 2 weeks. They had to order a carburator."
1,Warning! Very hard to start! Shuts off by itself!,"This is the worst trimmer I ever bought. It takes numerous pulls to get it started even when using starting fluid! If you don't use starting fluid, forget about ever getting it started. I'm a big guy and my arms hurt from trying to start it. Brand new out of the box it is almost impossible to start. And if you don't keep your finger on the trigger the whole time you are using it, it will sputter and turn off. Adjusting the idle screw barely helps. Good luck getting it restarted. This thing needs to be taken off the market now! Amazon if you are listening stop selling this item! I made the mistake of not opening the box until a month after I bought it so I don't even have the ability to return it."
3,Good for Price but died after 3 years,"This unit only lasted me 3 years which isnt too bad considering I bought it at a pretty good price when it was on sale. Problems I had often were starting the unit, lots of vibration, and it's pretty heavy. I went ahead and bought a Hitachi and man was it a big difference.Overall it was good while it lasted."
2,Won't Idle without choke,"Item received in perfect condiion, but, it doesn't run right. Unable to adjust carb because a special tool is needed (because of EPA, I guess they are making it harder for user to adjust air/fuel ratio). Price and shipping were great."
3,good for the price,"this weedeater does do a good and the only reason I did give a 3 star is it tends to bog out quite a bit. If I to purchase another it wouldnt be this one, I would spend more money and get a stihl."
1,To Be Avoided!!,"This is the single most frustrating piece of lawn ""equipment"" I have ever owned and used in 48 years.Takes many, many pulls to start, (yes, I follow the instructions to the letter), and still I struggle.Once started, WHEW, it runs better on ""half or partial choke setting"", then it does in ""run"" setting.I have had mine about one year and now when I do get it started and move it to ""run"" in immediately stops. (It has done this since I bought it brand new.)If am ever so fortunate to get it to operate in the ""run"" setting it stops as soon as I pull the trigger to use it.It is also so INCREDIBLY LOUD, YES, I AM SHOUTING TO MAKE A POINT!!Without ear plugs I actually have an earache in both ears when I am doing using it for 10 minutes.I am so very, very disappointed in so many ways!I don't even know that I would donate it to a charity to be ""fixed"".Why give them my problems, I am sure that have enough of their own.Don't waste your money on this one!I am so sorry I did!"
2,not pleased,"Would not run right from the get go. Had to take for service. The balance is awkward, making it feel heavier to handle."
3,Weed Eater FLSST25 25CC,"Purchased this trimmer on the strength of a Consumer Reports recommendation for a budget-priced, simple, straight shaft trimmer. It does what I expect it to do. I'm not disappointed."
1,JUNK,IT HAS BEEN ALMOST A MONTH SINCE I ORDERED THE TRIMMER. IT IS STILL IN THE SHOP BEING REPAIRED. WHEN I CALLED THE MANUFACTURER AND AMAZON TELLING THEM IT WAS DELIVERED BROKEN THEY TOLD ME TO TAKE AND GET IT FIXED. THE ONLY PROBLEM WAS ONE OF THE REPAIR PLACES WANTED $25. JUST TO LOOK AT IT. I HOPE I WILL GET IT BACK THIS WEEK THE SHOP HAS HAD IT FOR OVER 10 DAYS TRYING TO FIX IT
4,Weedeater FLSST 25 Gas Trimmer,This is a very light weed eater compared to the other ones I had.Starts up very fast and the spool comes off in a snap for replacement.I highly recommend this trimmer. The free shipping wasn't bad either!!
5,Weed Eater Gas Trimmer,The price was very competive. The product arrived on time and I find that it works better than my old electric trimmer. I am completly satisfied.
4,Trippy,A great insight which contains new perspectivesand wisdom for the living. I listened to this every day in Phoenix traffic which is horrible and it mellowed me out. The book pairs well with psychedelics. :)
2,Know what you get before purchasing,"I was expecting an instructional video like the David Howard videos that I enjoy so well. Instead it only showed footage of Bujones and had a Spanish woman just telling what the steps were mostly. I thought that Bujones was going to TEACH a full ballet class. I would recommend that you know this is not like a ""take a ballet class at home"" video like David's. This shows the footage of Fernando Bujones along with the Varna competition that he won."
2,"This is the ""Participant's Guide""",I wish I had read the other review. I ordered this thinking that I was getting a paperback version of the book. It isn't. But the book was highly recommended...I'll try again.
1,A Bend in the Road,Not pleased to receive a 'workbook' instead of a paperback book. Totally dis-satisfied with description.
4,"Great new episode, but also some older ones","This DVD contains four episodes of Yo Gabba Gabba. The first is a new one called ""Super Spies,"" and, as a parent of a child who loves YGG, I was pretty thrilled to see some new content (I am sure she was too)! The other three episodes are older-- ""Mystery,"" ""Space"" and ""Big."" The only reason I gave this four stars instead of five is because I really had hoped for more new material, or a longer episode."

5,Great train video for all ages,This is the second time we've bought this video pack. the first pack had three DVDs. The variety is really good and very entertaining for the kids.
3,for some reason my boy doesn't like this DVD set that much.,for some reason my boy doesn't like this DVD set that much. He is now may be a little too young (only 2 year and 8 months).
5,I Love Toy Trains - full DVD set,My grandson loves these video. He wants to see them over and over. That can get a little old but beats the heck out of Barney The Purple Dinosaur over and over! The DVDs are entertaining and educational. The presentation is laid-back rather than hyper so our 3 year old has some quiet time while watching which he and his grandparents need from time to time.
3,Not a distinquished series,"This Time-Life series on Native Americans (American Indians) is not at all distinquished. The text is sketchy at best -- aimed for a general audience -- which makes it a brief introduction to the peoples studied. The photographs are sometimes striking, sometimes extremely poor. The most interesting part of these books are the good color photographs of art and artifacts, which may be of some use to artists."
3,Great Watch but Small,"The watch is constructed well, and it appears quite durable. Strangely, the watch band is small for my wrist and I am small boned. Nevertheless, I wear it everyday!"
3,Dark stuff,"Jim Thompson is a master at creating depression. He writes about characters who are battling personal demons and despair.In this book, we look at a character who starts work at an aircraft factory and what got me was the authors portrayal of the cruelty of some people in the little things that they do to hurt others at the workplace.The lead characters life is hell, his work is awful, the home life is dysfunctional at best and there does not seem any light at the end of the tunnel.The book does get a bit confusing at times and you can see that it is Thompson's first book as it is a bit long-winded but it is worth a read."
5,Review,"My order was expediated very quickly and I received my textbook within the following week which was very helpful. It arrived in great condition as well, and I am very pleased. The price beat out my local college bookstore by 50% which was a great help for my collehge budget as well!"
5,Excellent Deal,"This book was in excellent condition for the price I paid for it. Normally this book runs around $160 + tax in the regular college book stores, and I purchased it for literally almost 1/3 of that price. This product arrived promptly and was definitely worth the savings lol."
1,not even shipped!,"I have ordered this item and after almost three weeks amazon still asks approval for ""delays"", better not to order this item probably they are out of stock!"
2,Stopped Working,This was ok for 2 years then stopped working inexplicably. Some of the numeral segments intermittently disappear.
2,Only lasted 2 years,"Our unit lasted about 2 years then failed to show the outdoor temperature. (I see some other people have had the same problem with similar models.) The unit is consistently off by a few degrees, as well. Why on earth would you want to see fractions of a degree if the accuracy is +/- 2 degrees? On the other hand, the display is very easy to read. Just don't plan on it lasting too long..."
1,Save your $$$$,"I purshased this item and am extremely disappointed. It is consistently 4.5-6.2 degrees off from the correct indoor temperature as displayed by my Skyscan Atomic Clock. The outdoor temperature display is no more accurate. Save your money, don't bother with this inferior item."
1,Not Much,Disappointing performance and durability. Temperature always an approximation. Died after 20 months and glad to see it go. Won't buy Oregon Scientific again.
2,Be careful when installing...,"This unit appears to be a bargain: it's inexpensive, and my sample displayed the correct temperature within a half a degree. But installing the little wire underneath my window sliced it right off... Next time I'm getting the wireless version."
1,bad Model EM899,"After 2 years the display started losing parts of the numbers. Once in a while it would all come back, but for most of the time the numbers were unreadable. I called the factory but in so many words said, tough luck. They did not offer to replace the unit. Do not buy this Oregon Scientific product. It is the usual POS that is made in China.Jer"
2,LCD design Flaw?,"I bought two of these units a few years ago and both have now exhibited the same problem with segments of the numbers intermittently disappearing. At first this can be fixed by removing the batteries then replacing them some minutes later, but eventually both of the units would only display gibberish.I really like the functionality and the large display, but having two units with identical malfunctions has caused me to replace them with something other than an Oregon Scientific product."
2,Borderline junk...,"I have to agree with many others, this unit is really nice while it works, with it's large readable readout. But it's a race to failure between the thin wire(s) that connect to the outdoors probe, and the digits in the readout...whose segments first fail intermittently, and eventually fail permanently. I have at least 4 of these and was lucky to get a year or two before they failed, the readouts that is. The thin wires to the outdoors probes broke long before that. And who knows how accurate they were? I got the message (thanks Oregon Scientific!) and changed brands, went wireless. So far all the other brands purchased are still working."
4,1+1+1+1+1 GOLION!! :),"The cartoon I grew up on improved with all of the cutting room floor goodies added back in.The names are all different, it's more graphic, and now you have to read subtitles, but it's so much fun..the camp value here is off the charts.Throw in some Japanese cheese, mixed with some 70's disco funk and some 80's synth and you've got yourself a classic anime, with a FUN soundtrack/score.Basically an unedited flashback from a Japanese perspective.SUGOI!! :)"
5,Trumpet Student Must-have,"Serious high school and college trumpet players will be well served by owning this album. It contains several pieces with which you will spend a great deal of time during your studies, and gives you a clear, precise, and very musical account of them. The Kennan, Stevens, and Dello Joio are probably the most often performed works, but the other works on this album make a strong case for more inclusion on recitals as well.David Hickman is an excellent player who makes every phrase and articulation clear to the listener. I don't advocate trying to make one's performane a carbon copy of Hickman's, but this CD is an excellent model from which to work, and the number of pieces contained on the album make it a good buy for anyone who is interested, and particularly those who plan to study seriously, the trumpet."
3,"Hickman is okay, but....","For a REAL trumpet player, search for Amanda Pepping's newest CD. She is truly amazing."
4,Solid Music,"From the start this is an excellent selection. The best being ""Alathea (Live)"". ""Bridge of Sighs"" is powerful beginning to end."
4,Robin Trower,This CD is a nice collection of some of Trowers biggest hits. Great listening in the car.
5,Great Compliation,Got this from Amazon for less that $10.00 so can't complain. Great compilation of Trower Tunes.
5,"Simple to install, works perfectly!","I ordered this and the comparable lift support for the left side of the hood of a 1993 Toyota Camry XLE V6. The pair arrived quickly and were appropriately packaged. Installation took about four minutes per side (if that) consisting of removing one bolt from the firewall, removing the other end from the stud attached to the hood (held in place by a spring clip), and then putting the new strut in place in the reverse order.Now my hood stays up, and that's all there is to say. The lift supports have been in service for about a month with no signs of defects or any other problems. I'd buy these again."
3,Good Basic High School Text With One Caution,"This is a good basic text written at the high school (not AP) level. One huge caution, however: most of the links no longer work. The only links that are still up are the quiz links for the end of each chapter, and these are quite helpful for self--paced learners. The textbook often sends the student to these non-working links. It's not impossible to do a google search and find relevent links from other sources. But it does take more time on the part of the teacher."
5,Biology text,This was a great buy. The book was in good condition and the delivery time was excellent. I would definitely purchase other books from this site.
5,Love Them!,"I got these T-shirts for myself for Christmas and I love them! So comfortable and in my opinion, the best T-shirts for doing almost anything. I'd give 6 stars if I could."
5,Very comfortable undershirts!,"I honestly think these are the most comfortable, best looking undershirts I've ever had. Great for wearing under dress shirts, sweaters, etc. Also great to sleep in, because they're so comfy."
4,Pats cover good value,"Thi is a good tire cover for the money, of course ive only had it a couple of months but it looks great and one size fits all."
1,this is soft cover study guide NOT HARDCOVER TEXTBOOK - -,"DESCRIPTION FOR THIS ITEM IS WRONG...I ORDERED IT BASED ON THE DESCRIPTION AND WHEN ITEM ARRIVED IT WAS STUDY GUIDE. AFTER INVESTIGATING PICTURE IS OF STUDY GUIDE..HOWEVER..THE DESCRIPTION CLEARLY STATES TEXTBOOK, HARDCOVER - AS WELL AS REVIEW IS NOT FOR THIS ITEM. THIS IS ONLY A STUDY GUIDE (WORKBOOK) WHAT A RIP OFF!!! BUT YET, NOT THE FAULT OF THE PERSON WHO SOLD IT TO ME...ISBN # IS FOR STUDY GUIDE NOT TEXT!"
4,I disagree,"I rarely write reviews, but I must disagree with the other reviewer here. This series is about a fighting game, so yes, it has people fighting. Seems silly to not accept that right off, but I have watched the Tekken movie which I hated and the Street Fighter V series which I enjoyed and would give 3 stars to. This series is by far better than either of those. At least the first 2 discs anyway, which are all I have been able to find. The charaters are diverse enough to be individual and interesting and the art is some of the prettiest I have ever seen in an animated or anime series. Most of all though, I just like the characters and the fight sequences. If you do not like fighting games or shows based on them don't get this. However, if you are a Street Fighter fan, especially a fan of the animated Street Fighter then this is a great series to check out, just be aware you may never be able to find the later episodes."
4,Great stoner,"If you like true stoner, this is a must have. 4 songs from both bands. Dozer is still within their stoner period. All 8 songs are worth it!"
1,Description is misleading,I bought this thinking that it would show the outside humidity which is very important where I live.It does not. It only gives indoor/outdoor temperatures and INDOOR HUMIDITY. Since most people don't have a problem with the indoor humidity this info is not worth much.It seems like they intentionally worded a misleading description on this product. Any indication of trying to mislead the consumer gets ONE Star in my book.
2,Cheap toy,"You really weren't expecting a scientific instrument for this amount of money, were you? Unit took half an hour to stabilize temperature readout when moved from one room to another. My unit does not display odd number temperatures in the range 80 - 90 degrees F or even number digits in the range 70 - 80 degrees F. As if its native sensing is quantized to 1 degree C and then converted to Fahrenheit. Temperature reads 2 degrees F high compared to my Taylor mercury bulb thermometer. Don't know high accurate the humidity readout is but it seems high. It would be really nice if an adjustment screw were provided. Made in China."
1,Don't waste your money,"This would fall into the category that ""you get what you pay for"". This is an inexpensive product and it performs like one. Looking specifically to use this as a hygrometer and found that it was more than 10% off on most occassions so it really isn't much good. Temperature was off as well by 2 - 5 degrees.Readings are very slow to change. It took several minutes to record a 10 degree drop in temperature?"
1,Inacurate device,This device is inacurate regarding Hygrometer.It is %20 OFF where I live in San Diego 10 miles near the beach.
3,Good Learning Tool,"This is a good book for learning. There are some parts in the book that are not easy to understand. When completing some of the assignments, one should have an instructor or a tutor. The book is promising for classroom students. However, for the self learner it is not a walk in the park."
4,Raider Tire Cover,"Very nice high quality cover. Fits a 31"" x 10.5"" tire no problem. I wish they made one to fit a 33"" tire."
3,"False Advertising from the Seller, but they work OK","The Seller has since changed the image, but initially, the image and description was for Seashell Shaped Bathtub Treads, which is what I wanted, and I was willing to pay a little more and wait for them to be delivered...rather than just going down to the hardware store and picking up these Saftey Tread ""Sticks"" for half the price that I paid!Since my tub is super slippery, once I finally received them, I was too eager and annoyed to send them back, so I just applied them. I let them know I was unhappy with my purchase, and they offered me a DISCOUNT if I would remove the negative comment/review I had posted, but that's it! NO offer to refund my money just for the sake of them sending me the WRONG product, or to replace it with the CORRECT product. So Buyer Beware with them, but as far as the actual product I got...they're your basic, boring safety treads, so if that's what you're looking for, I haven't slipped, sooo...they get the job done."
3,Half of the Story,"One of the best things about Earth, Wind & Fire was their diversity. Sure, they could lay down a beautiful ballad, but they also created some of the hottest horn-based dance tracks known to man. ""Beautiful Ballads"" opts to tell only half of this story. Apparently, this is Sony/Legacy's short-sighted, transparent stab at recycling classic material from their vaults in time for Valentine's Day (other artists in this series include the Isley Brotheers, the O'Jays and Gladys Knight). It isn't a bad idea per se, especially if you flinched at the raw energy of ""Serpentine Fire,"" or recoiled at the intensity of ""Getaway."" If you need a soundtrack that will help you to `get lucky,' then this may do the trick; ""All About Love,"" ""Fantasy"" and ""Be Ever Wonderful"" are lovely sentiments graced with lush musical arrangements. If that's what you're aiming for, then good luck - I only hope that she doesn't get too excited and ask to hear ""September"" or ""Shining Star."" B Tom Ryan"
5,Ballads by Earth Wind and Fire,I love EWF. I grew up on EWF and they have always been one of my favorite bands. Their music ranges from dance to easy listening. I recommend this CD and group to anyone who hasn't sample the Elements.
5,Fast and prompt delivery...,I received my product in excellent condition. It was delivered to me in a fast and prompt manner.
1,OK. peice of trash,It looks good with the bottom glowing light and at first I liked it alot. However so after the light would blink off then finally the USB ports fell into the plastic case. It looks good but won't stay together long enough to justify buying it.
2,Not so good...,Pros:Easy to attach to controllers.USB PoweredNice design (easy to place next to PS3 hooked up via USB)Bright blue lights glow at night (looks cool).Cons:Stopped charging after three days
1,Terrible Product,I bought this and the first day I had it the USB connectors that poke out got pushed inside of the thing. This thing is garbage and you'd be better off just charging one at a time.
1,It broke after using it once,I bought the dual charger and it broke after I used it once. The two charger pieces that go into the controllers retract into their plastic housing and can not be retreived. Perhaps my charger was defective but it looks like a design flaw. The blue light is cool though- just not so cool when the product is broken.
1,GARBAGE!!!,"This is absolute garbage!!! I just got mine... plugged it in and it didn't work. Then I tried using the USB cable that came with my PS3, and wow... the blue light turned on. Amazing!!! Next I tried connecting my controllers to the thing, and guess what??? It simply doesn't work!!!At least I have a very nice looking (cheap as hell plastic, but nice looking) blue light thing to decorate my living room with...DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!"
1,Cheap piece of Junk!,"I purchased this item because it was cheap and I figured that since it essentially is just a USB splice, it couldn't be all that easy to mess up. BIG Mistake. All this thing did was light up an annoyingly bright blue LED, And that's all it did. Never once did it attempt to charge a controller. However, if you do receive one that does function; this thing has to be plugged into a running PS3 to work, witch means it can only charge when you want to play with the PS3. With all that said, and take into consideration that I say this with the interests of the consumers (you) in mind. Do not waste your money on this."
2,Not what I thought it would be...,I didn't look into this product before I bought it. I really thought this was going to charge up using a separate power source but it still does what it's intended to do..
3,PS3 controller charging station,"This items works okay with the PS3, but connection to controllers is a bit difficult. You must make sure that you do not damage the controllers when plugging it up. USB to PS3 very easy to plug in. That said, we utilize this thing everyday."
2,Decent Charger,"All-in-all, it's a decent product. My only complaint is that it charges off a USB and not a wall plug. It charges well and quickly and does what it says."
5,Great Energy!!!!!!,Ubaka and friends are so into the primal beat. I highly recommend this recording for those who love tribal drumming and those who are into energy work. These earthy songs can really connect you to your spirit and get your feet moving. I loved it!
2,Should stick to drumming,"My apologies for the harshness of the title, but it's true. Track 3 is totally awesome and typyfies what I had expected from the CD. The rest of the songs really grated on me, though. The singing seemed to me to be constantly out of tune and tried to go beyond range. The lyrics and composition were infantile.My advice: Listen to the samples. If they're definitely your style, purchase the CD. Otherwise, save your dimes."
4,Excellent Original Jazz from Chicago,"Pianist Bob Dogan takes this opportunity to showcase his original jazz compositions. This is a straight ahead jazz album with a fresh approach. Dogan's compositions are catchy and a bit unpredictable. The ensembles are an interesting mix, ranging from a trio number to full ensembles with bass trumpet, trombone, guitar, piano, bass and drums, or with tenor sax, bass trumpet, guitar, bass, drums and piano. All the musicians are excellent and the ensemble work is very lively, not at all stilted by the recording studio. The tracks are long enough to provide good opportunities for blowing and all the musicians are featured at some point. If you haven't heard many Chicago jazz musicians this is a good introduction to some of Chicago's best. I have listened to this CD many times and always hear something new of interest. I highly recommend this album."
3,Does not work as well on smaller spares,"I purchased this for my camper spare tire which is a little smaller. I had to use bungee cords to keep it tight. Otherwise, the product looks great and helps me show my Purple Pride!"
5,Great Bowl,"I love this bowl!!! It's perfect for a kitten (and a grown cat). It looks exactly like the picture. The bowl is stylish, sturdy and practical. I love the way it looks on the floor. I highly recommend this product :)"
5,T Bone is The Man,"Flat out the best record I've heard in the last 20 years. Lyrics that compare to Jim Morrison, John Lennon, or Jack Keroac for that matter. Ground breaking re-direction of American Roots Rock. Compelling, thoughtful, eye opening. Fantastic..."
3,Not my favourite,I saw Crazy Heart and loved the music so I figured the music of T Bone Burnett would be the best. This particular CD would be fantastic. FOR ME it wasn't. My husband loved it and plays it everyday in the car.
2,Not my cup of tea,"I really wanted to like this, but after many repeated listens I just cannot shake the impression of listening to something pretentious and contrived that I get from this. I had high hopes for this one. Alas, they were dashed."
1,disappointed,"As a huge long time T-Bone Burnett fan (I saw him in Austin in '83 or '84), I was eagerly awaiting the newest CD. I was very disappointed. The songs were just not that good. I found the CD ponderous and claustrophobic (but I am not thrilled with Sam Phillips, so take it for what it's worth). I have only listened to it twice (so I am giving it one more listen), but I urge people to purchase Twenty Twenty. An excellent album with a good booklet to go along with it."
1,Bull Shite,"No Surrender! Ulster Forever! ""F"" the Sinn Fein and the IRA. Of course they're one and the same. Don't believe a word of this socialist propaganda. If you want to know the truth, you won't find it here."
3,Not what I expected,"Thought this was a documentary or concert footage of Gin Blossoms, but it is just 5 videos. Not really what I was expecting and a bit disappointing."
5,RIPPLES TO KNIT,RECEIVED IN NEW CONDITION WITH TIMELY DELIVERY. PRODUCT HAS EASY TO UNDERSTAND INSTRUCTIONS AND ILLUSTRATIONS. GREAT FOR A BEGINNER LIKE ME! THANK YOU.
5,Beautiful audio equipment shelf,"This shelf was easy to install and is quite stunning. It easily holds a receiver, dvd player, and ps2. It also looks elegant and doesn't appear to take up much space in the room."
4,Good book -- deserves better editing,"The book rings true as a vivid description of life in development work. It's a very good and very informative read. My only complaint is that it could be better edited. Simple grammar errors occasionally slip in (for example, I remember the phrase ""beckon call"" used when ""beck and call"" was intended). Also the author's description of his work sometimes dwells on technical issues that slow up the story a little.The reviewer from Mali who complained of distortions should remember that the author worked in Mali 20 years ago, and that conditions have no doubt improved since then."
2,Old vinyl,"This CD has the recording quality of old vinyl records from the dawn of the stereo age. The vocalist appears to be trying to reach the back of the audience without a amplification, and the the voice quality is reminiscent of pre-electrical process Operic arias."
1,"Book Great, Condition Poor","We love the book, but it arrived in the mail as is without an envelope. So, if it was in good condition before we received it we would not know. It came to our doorstep stained and crumpled."
5,We love this book!,"My daughter, 3, loves this book. I wish there were more books like this. Books about real kids doing normal things that use photographs of kids instead of animal characters. My daughter really relates to the photos and situations in the book. Good for any little girl who is interested in ballet!"
4,Real life pictures,"I bought this for my daughter's fourth birthday which happened to be of the ballerina theme. I like the book because the pictures are real photographed pictures, and it holds the child's interest in seeing a peer talk about her experiences going to and coming from ballet class, preparing for a recital, etc. It also introduces the child to some basic ballet steps through the art of photography. This is a nice addition to anyone wanting some books about ballet for their child. For the younger audience (ages 2-4)I Wear My Tutu Everywhere! (Reading Railroad Books)is also a great find!"
3,Worst championship fight ever,"Even though this was a better than average event, the title fight was horrible. Witness the return of Mark Coleman, Brian Johnston, Jerry Bohlander, Tank Abbott, and Scott Ferrozzo, but don't expect to be blown away at the end..."
3,Could I fight the ref?,"Easily the poorest of my favorite UFC format, the 8 man tournament. Four good (not great) fights, one poor fight, and one horrible fight. No final bout, as Mark Coleman is the only man left standing. This video showcases Tank's only bad fight. Win or lose, when Tank gets in the octagon, you know there's going to be a fight. This time..."
2,Last of the 8-man tournament era.,"This tournament had the makings of a good show. We had Mark Coleman returning to defend his tourney championship, along with some veterans(Ferozzo, Abbott, and Bohlander), and Jiu-Jitsu champ Fabio Gurgel. Coleman breezed to the finals, destroying his competition rather easily. It was the second half of the bracket where the problems began. The winner of the Bohlander-Gurgel fight wound up injured and unable to continue. The substitute won the next fight, but was injured for the finals. It was a mess! A Superfight of any sorts was needed badly!"
2,Boring,this was mark coleman being mismatched with a bunch of guys that he outclassed. bohlander and abbott were on the other side of the bracket and werent able to advance for one reason or another. ufc 10 was better.
3,wood handles?,if you buy this set do not leave the cutlery in standing water as the wood handles get funky looking when soaked in water. Also I am surprised that Chicago Cutlery would put their name on this set. I think of Chicago Cutlery as a high quality product and this set does not stand up to that standard.
2,Chicago Cutlery is not what it used to be.,I understand you are not going to get razor sharp knives that hold an edge for any length of time in this price range or anywhere near it. But I do expect to be able to attain a decent edge with regular sharpening. These knives take a lot more work than usual to get an OK edge that lasts for two to three uses. I would not buy from this maker again.
3,"Terrific Value, Handles Need Help","I got this set for my mom for Christmas. She is a ""cook"", no t a chef, so the knives are fine for her purposes. Better than what she had. The biggest disappointment was the wood handles, I don't know if they were not treated or what, but right out of the box they were dry and rough. They felt like they would give you splinters. My mom put some oil on them and it helped, but had I seen the handles as they were before purchase, I probably would not have purchased them. Or at least made the handles more presentable myself. But - I paid $25 for them and can't really complain too much."
3,"Very basic, but they work.","For Cutlery purposes, Chicago is now found in mainland China. For what they cost ($20 Gold Box) they're great. I think they're going to give my made-in-Chicago brand Chicago knives a run for the money!"
2,Not that great,"I bought these knives for $20 when they were on the Gold Box sale (at Amazon). I have purchased Chicago Cutlery's ""Walnut Traditions"" knives in the past and found them to be of decent quality. These knives are of substantially lower quality than the old ""Walnut Traditions"" knives. While $20 is not a bad price for a complete set of knives, I wouldn't be happy if I had paid more. The steel is much flimsier (is that a word?) and the handles are not as nice as the old version. The wooden storage block seemed nice (I think it's made out of rubberwood)."
2,Real Cooks Need Not Apply,"I would not reccomend this knife if you like to do a decent amount of cooking. Otherwise, just hope the only way you get this knife set is as a gift (don't buy it)."
5,Right on,My grown daughter was so tired of dull knives with cheap handles. Now she has Chicago cutlery to last a life time and a sharpener to go with it. She was very pleased for Christmas.
1,Photo and Description Very Deceiving,I own a Traditional set of Chicago cutlery and the quality is much better. This set is very small and cheaply made. I plan on sending it back.
4,Good starter set,"It's a good inexpensive starter knife set, great deal for the price paid. Packaged well arrived in time for Christmas"
3,Little,"I'm normally good about reading descriptions... but somehow I missed that the large chef knife was just a litte biddy thing... Luckily for me, this happens to be my preference in knife sizes. The wood handles do need occasional oiling, no biggie there. I mainly bought the set for the 8 steak knives and am very pleased... and since was a sale item, it was defiantely cheap enough to be worth it."
5,Nothing beats a great set of kitchen knives,Chicago Cuttlery is some of the finest quality knives that I have ever used. I come from a background as a butcher and I can tell you from my experiences that Chicago Cuttlery is some of the finest steel available to the consumers. Each knife is razor sharp and the is a sharpening steel when needed to hone the edges. Excellent quality at an excellent price!
2,Disappointed,Knives are of low quality. Flimsy and not even sharp! No bread knife. Not worth the $$ I paid for them.
4,Good Set for the Price,"Fast shipping - no problems with order. Item as described - knifes very sharp. Wish set had been available with black handles, but overall a good buy. Pleased with purchase, and would use this seller again."
1,Pathetic,"My parents had a similar set of Chicago Cutlery Walnut blades from the early 90s and these simply do not compare. This knife set is pathetic. The block and handles of the blade arrived without being oiled. They were dry pieces of wood that literally caused splinters when handled. I tried soaking them in oil for a couple of days, but that did not work long term. After a few washes (by hand) the knives' handles had already gone back to splintery wood. On top of that, the blades began rusting. I am very disappointed by the lack of quality seen in this knife set. I would not recommend it to anyone."
2,Stop!!! This set will rust!!!,"I bought this set for 19.99 and it's not worth a penny more than that. The knives rusted the first time I washed them. Really not a good set at all and I were you, I would move on and find a better set. Hope this helps!!"
2,"Handles are junk, split and 'threading' slivers of wood","Junk. I was amazed, as I have a GREAT set of Chicago Cutlery (440A Fine series). You just cant make them better than that set...but they proved they can do the opposite. This isnt even good as a starter set, as you're never going to use them without kevlar gloves, unless you like splinters and cutting yourself from using more force to slice from the dull unsharpable blades."
3,Garden Flag,Very nice but thought it came with the Flag pole. I need to read some item descriptions better. LOL
4,An inreresting overview of various Earth energies.,"This was a very interesting book. Several forms of Earth energies are covered. There is an emphasis on the system of energy leys in Scotland. The author proposes that the ability to detect such energies is inherent in the human body. He used dowsing rods to follow the leys all over the Scottish countryside.He found that many of the ancient megalithic monuments were a part of the ley system. Also, some caves, churches, etc. are also parts of it. He even notes that modern structures sometimes modify these ancient paths of energy.The energies of these leys can also affect human mental states and body functions. This could explain some supposedly supernatural phenomenon.I do not regret buying this book."
2,Disappointed,"I was disappointed that there was no mention of Hartman, Curry lines, etc. I figured this would at least cover the basics. Everything is British--all sites the author mentions. Hard to relate to here in the US, but biggest concern was the lack of the basics mentioned. I'm sure there are better books out there for the purpose. This one is really narrow."
2,More of a journal,"This isn't a very well written book. It seems to annal the author's hobby of following ley lines, but doesn't really explain much about them, just patterns and connections. He's a little out there too, telling of how he'd leave an apple behind on a standing stone as tribute to its energy. I was expecting more of a scientific approach to the energies that seem to exist around standing stones and other ancient structures. This book didn't deliver."
2,Valuable Information!!!,Great work from David Cowan.A lot of really useful information.Lost Ancient knowledge rediscovered.Get it before it goes out of print again!!!
3,Great Songs,"Gladys Knight has always been one of my most favorite singers. I enjoyed the albumn, however, I wish it had included more of her songs. I will have to purchase more of her music."
2,Not what expected,The cd has a poor sound quality. The collection of songs is excellent and beatiful.The cover says that it is digitally mastered by Sony but the copies they made from the original are disappointing.
3,Beautiful Ballads,"This CD is ok, not as nice as I expected. Guess I was looking for more of mixture of Gladys Knight's top hits and some Galadys Knight and the pips hits. It's ok."
2,If you just want something to read...,"This book's not bad - much like the first, it's very slow, not a lot of action, but with the bones of a good story. However, there is one glaring error that i can't believe made it through the editing process. At one point the author introduces a pair of conjoined twins who have since seperated themselves using magic... but one of the twins is male, and the other female. Oops! Conjoined twins are imperfectly seperated IDENTICAL twins.Nitpicking aside, the characters are a bit bland, but the ideas behind them are interesting. It's an undemanding, gentle read. I think that Trudi Canavan has the potential to be a really good author, but so far this series lacks the conflict, the pacing and the excitement to achieve that potential."
3,Good Book,Trudi Canavan is great author but I felt this particular book left just a little lacking but it was okay.
1,Never received,I'm still waiting on this product. Can't believe it's taken so long. Wouldn't order from this person again.
5,Simply wonderful,This was the first book by this author that I've read. I loved it and rushed out to pickup Book 1 and preordered Book 3. Highly recommended read.
1,Not as advertised,"This is listed as a JAVOSync cord. The JAVOSync cord has an integrated sync button built into it, which saves you the trouble of having to find and launch the sync program on your Palm unit every time you sync to your computer (you can see one on the JAVOedge website). Instead of a JAVOedge product, this is something made by Insten (?), which does NOT have the sync button. That feature alone is why I ordered this particular cord among the many others available. Looks like bait and switch to me. I will be reporting this to Amazon."
1,3% of RDA,I had a potassium deficiency and I wanted something on hand. This product AND ALL THE OTHERS LIKE IT supply only 3% of RDA. An orange or a banana supple much more.
5,Where are these guys?,Where are these guys? This is a great CD full of catchy tunes and nice vocals. I've been waiting for a follow-up disc but have heard nothing from them since. I want more.
5,ALL I CAN SAY IS WOW!!!,What a talent these guy's are. This album is 5 star's from begining to end. Run don't walk to buy this one!!!
4,WHAT A DUO,I must say with their unique sound that they are going to be around for awhile. I just love their new album and can't wait to see them in concert.
4,Family Tradition,"Both performers are sons of Nitty Gritty Dirt members.The apple doesn't fall too far from the tree.Having heard them on the ""Will the circle be unbroken"" Vol III,I was eager to hear this new CD. I was not disappointed."
5,Weezer enters the home video market - finally,"This DVD is sort of a video yearbook of Weezer, except it covers over a decade. The most interesting stuff on here is the behind-the-scenes and recording studio footage. The music videos were nothing new but it was nice to have them all in full-screen quality. In my opinion, the part where Weezer verbally bashes O-Town or the Mikey line ""you can win a bucket of porridge"" are worth the cost of the DVD alone. All things considered, this is a very entertaining video that follows a logical progression from their early days with Jason Cropper to their Maladroit touring days. Buy it now, it's really good. Really."
5,rock the weez!,"Well, this dvd is great for the less inthused fans of the weez just for the simple fact of the videos,but is also loved by the greater fans of the '=w='. weezer has made some RAD videos over the years and this just shows them off. If your a hardcore so to speak weezer fan you will enjoy this greatly because of the other footage you will see, like, live performances, home shot footage, and much more. everytime i watch this dvd i notice something more about it to love. i really request you to buy this because i know you will highly enjoy it. HEY have a weezer party and show it to your friends, everyone will love it!"
3,Not as good as it sounds,"I wanted this dvd so much since the day it was released. You know, the music videos, live performances, cool commentaries, etc. Yeah, this could be a must have, except for the poor audio. I know this compilation has it all, but I can't recommend this stuff when it isn't preceded for a good audio quality. I am a fan of the band, in fact, I've grown up with their music, so this could be the main reason of no letting pass any kind of technical mistake. So if you even want to buy it, you've been warning.."
5,'THE' DVD for Weezer fans,All the videos you'd want and more. Great quality. A must for any Weezer fan to enjoy.
3,Get it for the videos,"Really simple review: having all the videos in one place is great, especially the little-seen ""Pinkerton"" videos. The live concert footage is outstanding also. The studio footage and ""home movie"" footage I could have done without; it's boring."
3,It gets better,"High Heel Blues is a decent first album. Her second one, New York Blues Queen, is far better. HHB has some good soulful tunes done quite well. NYBQ has many really good tunes with much better engineering and production. You owe it to your ears to get a hold of New York Blues Queen! Or, better yet, catch her live !"
5,Sassy NYC kicking blues!,"Great voice and I love the attitude! Wish she would put out more music, becuase I would buy it all."
4,Music critic in Calif,"I have both of Roxy's cd's and I also think the 2nd cd ( New York Blues Queen )is the best one by far. And if you ever get a chance, do check her out live, because she is GREAT and so are NY Blues."
1,Amateur Hour,"This is the worst album I have ever paid money for. Just dreadful, and if you shelled out money to see this stuff live, it's even worse. Proof positive that NYC is the worst town for blues in the world"
1,Review:Behind the Cosmetic and Plastic Surgeon's Mask,"This book is so poorly written I am shocked it is in print. In addition to the vast amount of grammatical errors, the book is flat and uninformative. The author tries to appear pithy and knowledgeable, but is neither. I would not recommend this book."
4,Solid Introduction,"This book is a solid introduction to Rats and more than sufficient for most first courses in analysis or econometrics. It won't teach you how to code, but if you know programming and just need to learn Rats, this is sufficient."
1,Obsolete and will not run on PCs newer than 2000,"The Corel Linux OS was written over 11 years ago and is TOTALLY obsolete.It never ran well to begin with, honestly. Corel rushed it to market to jump on the early Linux bandwagon. After huge financial losses and thousands of unhappy customers, Corel shuttered their Linux division, dropped all support and sold it to Xandros. Xandros does not support any Corel versions of Linux.The version of WordPerfect that is bundled with it is not native to Linux, unlike WordPerfect 8.0 and runs under the WINE emulator; notoriously unstable in this case.This software isn't worth the box it came in. Save your money if you're looking for a version of Linux to actually run. It won't work 99% of today's computers. There are still millions of copies out therefore it has no value as a collectible, whatsoever."
2,Beware!,"Make sure you double check your purchase! This conditioner is black & when applying you will need gloves or your hands will stain & you can't get it out. I would only recommend using on black interiors or items, any other color will stain & not look good.Been using URAD for years & this is the first time we got black - thought it was all the same till we got it and found out differently. Go with the clear when making a purchase so you can use it on a wider variety of colors & items."
3,Too basic,"This book is ok. Its very basic and not up to the mark as far as digital design courses go in undergrad. Writing style is good, but once again, as far as content goes, not upto the mark. It's good for some lay person. But for someone who's intersted in doing this subject well, I'd recommend Digital Design by John F. Wakerly. I used Malvino before I saw the later book, once I touched that, I never came back to this one."
4,Warlord #2: The Cutthroat,"I read the first book about 30 years ago and didn't know it became a series. Good, fast paced entertainment with a few sub plots.Not ""literary genius"", but entertaining."
5,The Best for the Lowest price,"2 Top of the line Stabila levels for less than the price of one.Have seen the 48 inch going for 65.00. Purchased this package for around 55.00.. Am a capenter by trade, Stabila is used all that I work with... Durable and accurate!"
4,Dependable Stabila,"The box beam construction is a strong construction and is therefore more durable and retains accuracy better than most other types of levels. The color of the vial fluid together with the vial design make reading the vial easy-from above or below. The handholds are comfortable and very convenient for both carrying and measuring. The end caps are removable for flush measuring. After a little over 5 years, I am still very satisfied with the performance of these levels. The only problem for me is that the marks on the vial do not line up with the edges of the bubble when the tool is level. In other words, when the tool is level, there is a small space between the bubble and the vial marks. Bubble edges in some other tools are just adjacent to the vial marks when level. This design can make reading and adjustment of a level a little easier."
5,the best,"i have been a general contractor for 30 years,have used several sizes of the stabila levels, all perform great, no problems, true, an tough. new design over some of my older models a plus. if you use these tools to make a living, you will not go wrong."
2,"They're just OK, nothing special at all !!","Wasn't what i expected. Not as well made as my original 6' and 18"" Stabila levels. The surfaces don't look well milled at all and they feel bit cheesy to me. They do work and I guess thats what counts but I guess I got what I paid for. Not the great deal I thought I was getting.I might think twice before ordering Stabila products again. I ordered them thinking ALL Stabila products were as good as the ones I'd purchased in the past. Not so!I'm considering purchasing a good small Laser level being that my DeWalt LL is just too big and cumbersome for my purposes at this point and thought about ordering Stabila's but not at this point. I'm afraid of what I might get."
4,COVERS,"There are many RICHARD ANTHONY anthologies on the market.Most of them featured the numerous covers he did in the sixties.This is really for people who enjoy that kind of thing ,that was done frequently in that decade in FRANCE.What ANTHONY lacked was personality,which is the reason he did not survive too well after his early success.So this is up to you if you want to listen to CALIFORNIA DREAMING,CRYING IN THE RAIN,MAGGY MAY,BLOWIN'IN THE WIND and RUBY TUESDAY in FRENCH.My favorite is CE MONDE which suits his voice well.RICHARD ANTHONY is not a bad singer at all.It is a pity though,that he never found the lyric writer to extend his repertoire beyond covering stuff already recorded by others."
2,Disappointed,"Product received was not the product I ordered. It was also the wrong color. Instead of the sport grip lace around cover in black I received a tan super skin cover that laces in the middle only. The product was inexpensive, so I will not go to the trouble of returning it for a correct one, but I've always had very good luck with Amazon before and am very disappointed."
4,HUGE!!! Love it!,"Along with my two other pieces, this is a great compliment to the Empire. I wish the scale was a little more in line with the others (AT-AT) but that's being nit-picky.This took me about two days to put together (maybe 8-10 hours). I like to take my time and enjoy the detail. The model is TALL! Not so bad to move from one spot to another."
2,Somewhat disappointed,"Has an overwhelming amount of information, but is almost too complicated. I found it hard to navigate. Furthermore, I had to restart my computer twice during installation which I did not like, but afterward the program ran fine. The product is well done, and I appreciate the content, but I had hoped it would be more visually interesting and less complicated and bulky."
3,Marvel Vs,"Muy buenas cartas de Vs, realmente a mi me gustan xq hay muy buenos dibujos de los personajes de Marvel Comics"
1,DOLL BROKE,I bought this for my daughter who just turned 4. She loves The Little Mermaid and has all the Ariel dolls. She has wanted Prince Eric for a long time. It BROKE the day she got it. She was just trying to change his clothes. This toy is made so poorly. I don't recommend this toy at all. My daughter is very upset because the doll can not be fixed.
1,fast food,"One of the worst movies ever made. I was lead to believe Gerard Butler was in movie, if he is it must be as an extra, because he was not listed in credits. Horrible movie would not recommend to my worst enemy."
1,Misleading - not a Gerry Butler movie,"This movie is listed as one of Gerry Butler's and it is NOT. Do not be fooled as some of us were. Additionally, it is the worst movie I think I've ever seen - unless maybe you're 13 years old. The owner of this list needs to do an update and get this off the Gerard Butler movies list. Very sorry I wasted the money and will definitely not trust what I see here. I will do more research before buying next time."
1,Took advantage of Customer,"I order many items related to Gerard Butler, Fast Food is amovie he made, when I saw Fast Food grouped with items onthe Gerard Butler section I ordered it, It is not the correctFast Food, so I feel that Amazon took advantage and put theFast Food to get a sale. The correct Fast Food is not even ona DVD yet. Kathie Cirelli"
1,a full refund is in order if you ask me,"i ordered this movie from amazon because it was in the list of gerard butler movies - well, he was not in itvery very disappointed with amazon and i feel they should refund my money, but, i didn't know it until i opened it and watched....now i feel that i am at a loss."
3,"Not without flaws, but still a contribution","Self-esteem and school performance are often correlated. Teenagers who have high self-esteem are more likely to well in school than those who don't. In fact, academic self esteem is considered a component of general self-esteem (Harter, 1987). It is not clear how these are related; perhaps success in school makes a teenager feel better about him/herself. The data collected in the AAUW study are readily available on disk for any interested researcher. Although this book has a number of flaws, it makes a contribution to knowledge about today's teenagers in the US.Reference:Harter, S. (1987). The determinants and mediational role of global self-worth in children. In N. Eisenberg (Ed.) Contemporary topics in developmental psychology (pp. 219 - 242). New York: Wiley."
1,Pop/Pseudo-science,"Save your money. This report has been debunked by many other researchers. The conclusions reached by this ""study"" appear to have nothing to do with the actual data collected by the researchers. They seem to have been written before the data was even collected. While this report is widely available, the data it is based on is reportedly difficult to acquire, and with reason: it is embarrasing to the AAUW researchers. How do they conclude that girls are short-changed? Because their self-esteem is lower, and thus their school performance. Then higher self-esteem means higer performance, right? What they DON'T tell you in this report is that they found black boys to have the highest self-esteem of all the groups studied. So then why are black boys the group with the poorest performance? This ""study"" is by NO MEANS a serious academic work."
1,I Kept Hearing Helen Redy songs in the Background!,"Boys are the ones who are being short changed in schools today. When they are in elementary school the boys are being turned into little girls. They are not being recognized as boys. Boys and girls are different. The female elementary teachers do not understand boys. Why is it that most special education students are boys? Because women teachers don't understand boys. A part of the problem is that it is hard for men to get hired in elementary schools. Women don't want them around because male teachers are a blow to the female teachers egos. Usually the favorite teachers of the students in the elementary schools are men, the female teachers don't like this. If you are trying to get a job in the elementary schools as a man good luck!If girls are being short changed, then why is it that 60% of students going to college are female? The boys are the ones being ripped off in the schools!"
3,Average,This book was ok. It hasn't stood out as one of my favourites about Fibromyalgia yet I am sure others would still get something from it.
5,"A book that's definitely part of my working ""tools ""","P. Kiameh's ""Power Generation Handbook"" has been an invaluable addition to the materials I need to sucessfully execute my job. I work in the electrical power industry and Mr. Kiameh's simple and practical approach has provided that extra assistance that allows for easy solution to our every day problems. More importantly, Mr. Kiameh has managed to complile useful and important principles relating to the Power industry in one handbook. I highly recommend this book for technical personnel involved in the Power Generation Industry."
5,A must read Handbook,"This book is a ""must read"" for professionals who are interested in Power Generation. It is well written and adopts a systematic approach starting from the basics of Thermodynamics, through to the Turbines and Auxilires and concludes with the Generators.I highly recommend this book for the engineering professionals who are looking for the practical side of Power Generation"
5,"I really love Imajin they got very nice voices,John is cute!",I love Imajin songs Iam feeling them I really like John because he is so so so so cute and I love his voice.All of them has beautiful voices.I would love to meet them one day.
5,Imajin are 'DA BOMB!!,They are totally fine and they can sing too.i suggest everyone gets their single cause it is wickeder igive it tops. 5 star
5,A Beautifully Written Meditation on Prejudice,"A lovely, lyrical, well-written and sexy fantasy about life in modern America. Lee Cotton starts out as a white-skinned African-American in poor Mississippi and experiences racism at its most overt and problematic. Reborn as a white ""half-wit"" after a near-fatal beating, he's inducted into the Army's psychic research training. Lee continues his journey through becoming a woman after a car accident, a lesbian, and back to an African-American woman as he returns to the heritage that his Voudou grandmother gave to him. Wilson manages to portray every important issue - relations between races and sexes, the problems of love, feminism, and spirituality - in the middle of a captivating and often hilarious story. Watch for Cotton's final transformation at the end of the book and prepare to be surprised."
2,Too Strange,This book was too bizarre to recommend to anyone I know. The first half was interesting because it dealt with race relations in the fifties/sixties. I lost interest in the last half when it dealt with sexuality and pornography. It was too much of a twist in plot.
4,A Strange Tale from the South,"This is the story of a Black child, who looks extremely white, growing up in the south in dangerous times. It becomes a story that questions racial and gender identification. My book club chose this for their September book selection. We were all pleased with our choice, but found the novel quite strange. We couldn't agree on what actually had happened in the book. It's a great choice for a book club discussion."
5,At the top of her game,This is a fantastic album by one of Rock and Rolls best kept secrets. If you think that Melanie is all about Brand New Key or Candles in the Rain - then you are in for a huge surprise. Fresh - upbeat - and those amazing vocals all deliver on this album. Not a wasted moment. If you want to hear what someone that has been around the business for 40 plus years can turn out - then get a copy of this album - it is money well spent.
4,Very enjoyable recording.,"I find this recording very enjoyable. I am impressed with the quality of the singing and the serene, contemplative (and at times mournful) nature of the music. Recommended for anyone who enjoys chant."
3,"Cheap bracelets, don't expect much","I ordered these so that I would use them for a possible costume. They're cute, but one of them came bent in a weird direction (sort've fixable) and they're pretty cheap looking. Easy to break, very light weight, simple to wear on wrists."
5,Drawing faces,Very good book! Drawing the head is not very difficult but it requires more precision especially when drawing a real person
4,This is a good book to add the your art collection library,"It shows you how to draw from the inside out. The artist does not believe in starting the figure with lines but chariscuro (light and dark). He says to start of as a gesture drawing and then go in and start working with the shadows, not drawing the shadows and filling them in later, but start filling them with no lines. He shows you a few steps on how it is done, but he first goes over some basics and some materials. He talks about some techniques. If you want a better break down of a more step by step how to, then another book is needed. I think this book would be for an intermediate to advanced person. But, the work he does is good, like the Great Masters.Read the book, he is informative and makes you want to give it a try, he just makes you want to draw. Still not sure - check it out at the library first."
4,Excellent book for those interesting in developing their skills,"As a beginning artist I found the book to be very informative and it offers a number of ""perspectives"" that I had overlooked. It explains fundamentals in tones, shading, and the construction and placement of various facial features. Good book and certainly worth the money."
5,Simply the Best,Great for beginner to intermediate. I learned more from this book than any other book on drawing the head. Everything that's important is covered. In that respect it's complete just as the title implies. I read the one bad review here. Totally didn't get what he's saying.
3,Not a Complete Guide,"This book is not for beginners or even those who are not beginners, but who have no experience with pastel. There are so-called ""step by step"" instructions but it is difficult to understand how the instructor gets from the first drawing to the final one.There is little variation between the poses or the expressions on the models faces. If you want to draw something besides a three quarter pose with an unsmiling face you won't find it here. On the other hand if you are interested in drawing monsters, there is a whole chapter on that.A lot of space is given to discussing chiaroscuro with much repetition.If you are looking for a ""complete"" guide to drawing the head, this is not the book."
3,"Beautiful book, but deceptive","This is a beautiful book to look at but I found the title deceptive. No where in the book have I found drawing instruction for the head. The author/artist basically just does his own thing, but doesn't offer any direction for someone wanting instruction on the drawing of the head! I will keep it and possibly scan it again when I am more advanced."
2,drawing the head,I did not find this book very helpful to me. I did not like the pictures .They did not provide good examples to follow.
1,The artist's obsolete guide to drawing stiff freakshows,"If you know how to handle light and shadow then this book is useless for you. On the other hand if you don't, go look for another book."
4,Great for the beginning fan!,"I wish there were more videos on this, but this is a great way to start your video collection of the Temptations! Track listing includes:1. Stay2. I'm Here3. Standing on the Top (feat. Rick James)4. Time After Time5. I Wonder Who She is Seeing Now (features Billy Dee Williams in cameo appearance)With this video collection, the Temptations continue to shine and their legacy is as strong as their precise movements!"
3,not essential,The recording quality and musicianship is good on this recording. In my opinion the pieces are not his best and this can be passed over for other Hovhaness. This might be more appropriate for the completist. Try out Mysterious Mountain or Celestial Gate by this same composer before this CD.
4,Revealing the truth will yield arrows in the back,After reading this book and hearing the Crane's on Truth's that Transform (Dr. D. James Kennedy's radio broadcast) one can conclude that these men are sincere and not hateful in any way. Mormonism is like many cults in that the foundations and historicity of the religion are worse that shaky. Mormonism can be likened to a chocolate candy. The outside looks good and tempting but the inside is empty. The Crane's are using strong words to shake the minds of LDS believers. It takes strong medicine sometimes to get us to listen.
1,Joseph Smith Didn't Write It!,"A lot of people come to the misconception that Jospeh Smith wrote The Book of Mormon. This is incorrect, Jospeh Smith only translated The Book of Mormon with the power of God. The Book of Mormon or the plates that brought forth The Book of Mormon were written by ancient prophets in ancient America between 600 B.C. and 400 A.D. I testify to you that The Book of Mormon was translated through Joseph Smith by the power of God and without God, this 18 year-old could not have translated The Book of Mormon. Therefore, The Book of Mormon is true."

I testify to you that The Book of Mormon was translated through Joseph Smith by the power of God and without God, this 18 year-old could not have translated The Book of Mormon."
1,Our religion's crumbling? News to me...,"Hm. It appears that the LDS church's foundations are crumbling. I certainly wasn't aware of it. We still think the same of Joseph Smith as we always have: an inspired man, but still a man. We do not claim he is God incarnate. We Mormons are Christians; we believe in salvation through Christ, the only perfect man to walk this Earth. Smith was the man who, we believe, restored the full gospel to the Earth in these Latter-Days. The authors of this book clearly have a bone to pick."
1,Any truth that is only 1/2 quoted will sound foolish,"I am always disappointed when I read works of supposedly knowledgeable people who rely on 1/2 truths to further and argument. To say that Christ hated rich people is an obvious example of the words of our savior taken out of context. It is one thing to disbelieve the words of Joseph Smith, but it is something entirely different to misrepresent him as an evil man bent on violence and power. Crane obviously has an axe to grind, and it is apparent in this work. It is sad that so much effort would be put into spewing venom over a dead man's grave. Just say you don't believe him and leave it at that. Lying and twisting the truth will not gain you any more stars in heaven with your current faith."
5,Appreciated this book greatly,"I live in S.E. Idaho where 85% of the people are Mormons. Mormonism is an often spoke of subject around here.This book used documented back up and references for everything quoted by anyone. If a Mormon reads this book, all he/she has to do is look up the reference in the Doctrine and Convenants or Journal of Discourses and see where it is written. A bit of research does the job. And it is worth looking into. If the Mormon religion is truly a cult, it would certainly be best to learn everything you can about it (if you are allowed to) and make a decision about your eternal life!All I know is two things: Jesus is the Way, the Life and the Truth and no one comes to the Father except thru Him and I was once lost but now I am found."
1,MNabrotzky,"This is a typical anti-mormon book. The authors had all their conclusions drawn up before they ever started this venture. They ""proved"" their points by distorting the evidences or by presenting only one side. Having studied this subject for many years I discount the authors conclusions that Joseph Smith was a fake, that the church thinks less of him now. His stature has actually grown through the years. He was who he professed to be, a prophet of God, a tool to restore what was once lost. The more a person truly studies Joseph Smith's life the more he will be impressed with him and what he accomplished. There are many other books that one could read to get a truer picture of Joseph Smith."
5,WOW!,"Everything, and we're talking every last thing, you will want or need to know about hiking in Virginia. Comprehensive, yet does not overwhelm with information. This feature owes a great deal to the editorial layout. The pages themselves are aesthetically pleasing, with beautiful photos and interesting sidebars, and information is easy to find. No digging through indexes and tables of contents and flipping through endless chapters to find trail information. You can give it a quick read and get all the essentials, or take a little bit more time and peruse the more in-depth accounts of the trails (which are delightful, by the way).A special recommendation for including some of the more out-of-the-way and unique hiking destinations (such as the Eastern Virginia shore points, and the Southwest Highlands). I want to Hike Virginia!"
1,Wasted trees,"Of the roughly 30 books I've purchased and studied over the past year on related subjects, this is without question the worst. It is essentially a collection of several hundred extremely elementary articles, mostly written at newspaper level. All give the impression that the corporate patent attorneys were standing over the authors' shoulders to make sure they didn't say anything important. It is a black mark on McGraw-Hill's reputation. The main reason I didn't return it was that some of the articles provide useful references to the patent and professional literature. Of course, there are some useful data scattered throughout the haystacks, particularly for the business managers, but the book takes up far too much valuable shelf space. -F. David Doty, PhD."
5,Thank you Shawna,Sometimes in my rushed life I feel as though I don't have time for spirit or setting up sacred space for myself. With this cd I feel that just listening to even one of the songs on repeat on my ipod and breathing with it helps be bring spirit into my life even if its for 5 minutes. This cd is absolutely gorgeous. Thank you Shawna Carol for sharing this with all of us. Bless you!
5,Outstanding,One of my favorite CD's by far. Great for use in ritual but also great for just meditation or sometimes when I feel inspired I put it on while cleaning. I have so many chant CD's and many of them turn out to be dissappointing - this is awesome. I do have one warning - its entirely possible to become addicted to this CD - so buy at your own risk! =)
1,Designer Bodybuilding?,"This is a better book than most of Frank's writings, mainly because it has some good information... but let's face it... there are dozens of books on bodybuilding that are better on the subject and WITHOUT all the ""new age"" ramblings and commercial ""plugs"" about Frank's favorite products. If you are a serious bodybuilder and own a library of books on the subject, then feel free to add this one to it. If you are looking for 3 or 4 books solid books on musclebuilding without all the silliness squeezed in between the real information, then save your money on this volume."
5,Great Book!,"Great Book on bodybuilding from someone who knows what he is talking about. Somewhat dated now, but Frank Zane offers up what he knows and has learned in a lifetime of bodybuilding, in a Zen-like way. When it comes to bodybuilding, Frank Zane is the ""Pathfinder"" for legions of us."
3,Refusing the Favor,"Actual content of book is fairly monotonous (a little dated in the writing style). But it's for a class, so what can you do? It does have some interesting content regarding Spanish/Mexican women of the U.S. and beyond."
5,Fantastic. A must read.,A soldier's review of one of the greatest military tacticians of the 20th century. David Fraser brings the full weight of his military background to this work and does it in a way that doesn't overwhelm the novice reader.
2,In A Word -- BORING!,"Will not debate the academic merits of the material presented. Love Rommel and was anxious to read this work based on the reviews.Unfortunately, still only a third of the way through after several months due to the incredibily poor writing style. Some of the worst I have seen. End up reading the same sentence three times just to understand what the author is trying to convey. Very poor, verbose and pretentious writing style. REALLY, REALLY clumbsy and BORING.With regard to insights into Rommel's life and character, the book started well, describing his early leadership experiences in Italy -- but then seemed to totally disintegrate into generic ""overviews"" of later campaigns and stopped really providing much insight into Rommel or his personal role in the actions.Too many other good books out there on WWII to waste any more time on this one. Love the cover though.With an editor who could write, and a total redo, maybe this work would be worth reading."
3,"Good, but not Great","This biography on the greatest German tank commander and arguably the greatest tank commander of WWII is a little lacking. His book, while interesting and insightful portrays a rather harsh picture of Rommel the man, if not the commander. While Fraser was a British general during the war, he understandably comes off judgemental and is not objective. A far better book on Rommel would be (Rommel, the Desert Fox) by Desmond Young. Young was also a British general, and unlike Fraser not only fought against Rommel, but was taken prisoner by him during Rommel's fighting in Africa. After the War Young visited Rommel's family and interviewed many of Rommel's fellow officers including his driver. In conclusion Young's book is a easier and more accurate read."
5,Revealing!,"Dreams in Blue: ""The Real Police""As a 'history nut' I often read books on World War Two. I enjoy studying the 'main players', such as Erwin Rommel, the German Field Marshal. General Rommel is not new to me, but I must say this book brought out some facts I had not known. I found the book not only educational but interesting as it evolved from his early childhood to his eventual and tragic death. Rommel fought on the losing team, but he was not a loser in life. Rommel had courage and he had ethics. His only fault was that he believed in Hitler and could not see, until it was too late, the evil that Hitler brought to Germany.If you want to get inside the head of a great German General and a man who had an impact on his nation and our world, then read Knights Cross."
4,Points you in the right direction,"Once in a while a book that really helps comes along. This is one of them for someone that has no idea on how to start up a new business.I got this book for my wife who decided to consult and needed some business ideas to help her give more of herself. All the underlying aspects of what to do in particular cases are covered in the book. It seems strange to say that because the book is so thin, but it does the job. The only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 was the legal part of it was lacking. We had some specific areas of concern regarding legal matters and it did not answer them, nor even tell you where you might find the answer."
3,More depth?,"I like Seth Godin's funky style, but would really appreciate more depth and practical tips like the new Asian authors did with Dot Zen."
3,"cute and sweet, but perhaps not very memorable","A Regency romance, set in England. Jack Lester (newly and secretly financially enriched) is looking for a wife. She has to be beautiful, kind, and be a good conversationalist. She also has to overlook Jack's supposed poverty, and want him for himself. When Jack meets Sophie Winterton, he knows that she is exactly the perfect mate for him. But there is one catch - Sophie believes that Jack is poor, and refuses to marry him so that he can go out and catch an heiress. Sweet and cute story about a man who loves a woman who perhaps loves him a little too much.Sweet and cute, but perhaps not very memorable..."
2,Not one of her best,"I found this book kind of boring compared to her later works. The way Jack kept referring to Sophie as ""his golden head"" was just wierd. The next book in the series, An Unwilling Conquest, was much better."
3,1995 Re-Release,"A Lady Of Expectations by Stephanie Laurens was very basic love story - Boy meets girl , girl trys to protect boy and refuses boy and boy get girl. I wouldn't spend your money on this book - pick it up at he library."
1,Very Disappointing,Yuck. I really dislike it when an author's old work is published as if it were new. I unfortunately did not notice that the book was ten years old until after I bought it and started reading. This book is tedious and does not compare to her later works at all. It should at least have gotten a fresh edit or re-write before this publication.
3,Check it out carefully,I am a big fan of Stephanie Laurens and eagerly await her new books. I was very pleased to see this one on the shelf. Unfortunately when I got it home I saw that it was published by Mira (aka Harlequine). This is usually a clue that it is a reissue of an old book. I checked the copy write date and this book was originally issued in 1995. If you have not read it before it's worth a read. Not up to the standards of her Cynster novels or the Bastion Club but okay. Her style has matured since this book was written. If you have been reading Ms. Laurens' books for a while you should make sure you have not already read this one. I believe this particular book has been reissued more than once. It was enjoyable but not really a keeper. I will now have to return to the bookstore and wait for Stephanie's next New book.
3,Cute & Sweet,It was a relief to read a Stephanie Laurens book that wasn't one-third sex scenes. The female character was not as abrasive as her usual heroines. Worth reading.
1,Tepid as weak tea,"Jack Lester has found his ""golden head"" bride in beautiful blonde Sophie Winterton, but keeps his repaired fortune secret so that he'll be loved for himself. She's attracted to him, too, but alas! she believes It Can Never Be based on a rival's gossip that Jack must marry for money. Meanwhile, she lets an overbearing suitor, Marston, lecture her at every turn on his perceived impropriatories instead of telling him to get lost. Jack always shows up at the right moment to save Sophie from Marston's lectures. She never bothers to ask Jack about his intentions. And so it goes, endlessly."
4,A great book,It is a very interesting book and it has turns in it in unexpected places. love it. recomend it to everybody
1,Problem is it doesn't work if you have 64 bit operating system,"I bought this product some years ago but never got around to trying it and it got lost. It turned up the other day so I decided I would check it out. The audio works fine but the application won't install because I have a newer computer. This really points to the problem of the whole concept of a ""Lifetime"" anything. It only lasts as long as the technology that it uses.The content most likely is fine so the one star is only to warn you if you have a computer you bought in the last couple of years."
4,It fits,"Yes. This product fits my .22 cal. I have a few kits that are suppose to fit the .22 cal, but do not fit my Beretta NEOS. This one works well."
4,It works,"Brushes for .22s seem to be getting harder to find.So I was glad to see this.Just what I needed, good quality, price was right, and it arrived on time.And it cleans the bore just fine.Th-that's all, folks."
1,No Authenticity Here,"I purchased this book, assuming the title meant that authentic 1930's quilt patterns would be included, using reproduction fabrics. Instead, the designs had no period authenticity whatsoever! Each contributor simply used 1930's repro fabrics to make a quilt of any-old-style. This book was totally useless to me!"
2,Watch the color,"This a good product in terms of quality and feel for the price you pay. But the color is not remotely close to tan. It turns to be a hideous orangish brownish color. I just got it and put it on. Easy to install and stuff but the color is too glaring too ignore. I will keep it on until I don't get annoyed with the color and also until I can withstand the ridiculing from my friends that I will surely get because of this steering wheel. I guess it is not the dealers mistake per se, but they could have included more pictures of the actual product, after pulling it out of the box. The 2 stars is just for the color if not I would give it a 4 stars."
2,questionable quality,"I bought two of these. One has held up OK for at least half a dozen uses. The second one started falling apart on the third ride. The stitching that attaches the velcro on the side of the box has pulled up almost entirely. We tried super glue to hold it back down, but it didn't hold. So, we've got a bento box that doesn't have a usable mesh cover on the top."
4,great product,The Bento box fits on the bike in a way as to not interfere with hands and makes a handy storage spot for a cell phone and a power bar. Not much room for anything else.
5,Brilliant,"This is one of the most remarkable CD's that's come out of Nashville in a long time. The songs are well thought out, witty, emotional and real. The musicianship is unrivaled. Grammys are just around the corner!Go buy it, you'll be blown away."
5,dizscats,"Hot Apple Pie is a great band I meet them in Nashville at the CMA Music Fest and there were a great new sound and they have some catchy songs. I can see them really taken off in this business. Try some ""Hot Apple Pie"" today. I did!"
4,Great Music!,"I just saw these guys in concert and let me say, WOW! They def. rocked the house. The CD is great - up beat music and it is country!!! Down home music - love it!"
1,I don't want any of this Hot Apple Pie.,"I usually like Hot Apple Pie but this one won't be on my diet.What is Nashville up to. Have they forgotten there are older fans who want the real stuff, not more boy bands. This is one of the worst cds I've heard. The lead off single and video is sending wrong message to it's target age group. Now I'm not saying older people won't or can't like them. The vocals as well as the songs suffer from overproduction. The lyrics are way to sweet and gooey to make a lasting impression."
4,Hot Apple Pie,Love them and love their new video! The new country style is just what my generation is looking for. They will be right up there with Big & Rich in no time.
4,Un ouvrage très interessant sur la mécanique des anneaux,"Cet ouvrage est très utile si vous désirez améliorer vos connaisances sur les anneaux, et notament sur ceux de Saturne. Il nécessite, cependant, certaines connaissances en mathématiques et en physique. Cet ouvrage est cosigné par André BRAHIC, spécialiste mondial des anneaux. Il a notamment découvert les anneaux de Jupiter."
1,The pot metal handle drilled in two places broke after 3rd use.,You might look to buy a better battery connection spreader. The two holes on each side of the handle took strength away and split at one of the holes after the third time I used it on a standard battery terminal connection and I really didn't squeeze that hard. After 3 months the return window is up and return postage will eat up the cost of this inexpensive tool. You get what you pay for and I'm looking for a better spreader and will expect to spend more money.Next time I will buy a battery connection spreader with solid handles and no holes for rivets down the middle of the handles. I've found several on the market today like this one on Amazon..E-Z RED (EZRBK720IM) Battery Terminal Spreader
1,Broke after first use,I bought this product last year and this is the first chance I got to use it and immediately broke. Its made with inferior materials and the rivet broke while trying to spread the terminal. I will unfortunately be stuck with the cost of to replace the unusable tool.
1,whoa!!,"I read the reviews --some good ,,some bad . Ordered one anyway ,,if it lasts 2- 3 times its great!!Well---I should have listened, read closely.For cleaning its ok. 'For spreading the terminal its terrible.!. Does not work as a spreader.The handle has 4 rivets holding it in line -together ,The top rivet busted while spreading my terminal with the result of the handle collapsing.For those of you who are card carrying cheap -drill the rivets out replace with stainless bolts.I do not have the time or the patience to reinvent the spreader so I ordered the E-Z Red Battery Terminal Spreaderas its all one piece ( make that 2 pieces pls -but not riveted!)To the distributor --you need to use this 2-3 times , after that lesson,, get the Chinese to use better quality rivets - a lot better quality rivets !! While at it put some plastic on the handles to save the hands!!Raise the price ,improve the quality , or face a lot of returns !"
1,"Broke during first use, stay away...FAR away","Title for my review says it all - they broke the first time I tried to use them. I inserted into the battery terminal, grabbed the handle, squeezed, and the handles both collapsed. One side broke just above the 2nd rivet. I just tossed them in the garbage and ran up the street to Autozone to buy a different set.Stay away! FAR away!"
5,Singer in the Snow,"Singer in the Snow is a wonderful book. Not realizing that it was part of an extended universe when I read it, I found myself able to fully understand all that Marley was describing. The idea of a world where it is necessary to develop psionic abilities to survive is brilliantly played upon in this book, as is the notion that a gift can also be a curse at times. While I liked Mreen quite a bit, I connected more to Emle over the course of the book. I will definitely be searching out the other books in the Nevya cycle."
3,Emily's Review,"This book was okay. Some parts I really wanted to keep reading because it was exciting, but some parts were boring.Its about these Gifted people. They talk through there minds to every Gifted person. Mreen, and Emle are the main characters. Mreen has no voice so she sends to Emle, she talks for Mreen. Toward the end of the book the hrussmaster, Axl, tries to do something extreme to Luke. One part that I found interesting was when the Gifted can do things to help others out. Its called there Psi.You have to be a good reader to read this book. It has some hard words. There is a glossary at the front of the book for the interesting words they use."
2,good and bad,"This is go cute. My daughter loves it.the Bad thing is ""it has not off switch and the music goes off at the slightest movement"""
2,The string is too short!,"As you can see in the picture, the string to pull this toy around with is way too short. It's probably like 7 inches long. I honestly do not get it, why would you make a pull toy that you have to crawl to pull but you can't walk and pull. You'll just have to rig it up all ghetto by tying a longer string to the original one. Other than the string it is very brightly colored and the balls spin, so it is very cute but again the string kills it."
3,NO OFF SWITCH!!!,"My son really liked this toy, however for the parent, there are several problems: 1) There is no way to turn the toy off. 2) No volume control and it is slightly too loud. 3) The string (for safety reasons I'm sure) is very short and we had to tie a shoestring to it for it to be long enough for our son to pull while standing up. 4) This toy's sound maker is TOO SENSITIVE. Every time someone walked past it, it would start making noise. This is problematic when sneaking in to check on a sleeping child. I probably would have only given this toy one star because I really hate this toy. However, I gave it three stars because my son loves it."
3,Not so great,"This toy is very loud. It is supposed to play music when you pull it or turn the balls. Ours plays music even if you just pick it up to move it or to put it away. Also, the string is too short to really be a pull toy. I solved this by tying an shoelace to the string, then tying a Link-A-Doo link to the end of the shoelace to make it easier to hold. But you shouldn't have to ""fix"" a toy that was made to be a pull toy."
2,"Product is good, advertising is poor","There is nothing wrong with this product, but beware, these are mini-tabs. They are smaller and designed to make it easier to swallow. Normally, you'll take 2 instead of 1 a day.I gave feedback that they should change the product image, providing a higher resolution one so that it's easier to see that they are ""mini-tabs"". It's on the label, but rather tough to see if you don't shop around and know what to look for. The feedback I received was basically, ""The image is fine as it is.""They could also change the title of the product from ""Red Yeast Rice Extended Release - 60 - Tablet"" to ""Red Yeast Rice Extended Release - 60 - Mini-Tablet""If they cared about being accurate rather than deceiving us into thinking we've found a great price on a 60-count bottle of normal sized tablets, they would make the change.For those reasons, I'm giving this a relatively low rating."
4,Dillon knows his Irish history,"A good book by Dillon. He covers all parts of the Northern Irish Troubles, including British Army and security forces undercover actions and the way in which the IRA use devious ""honeytraps"" to tempt British Army men to their deaths. It also gives a section on the little known Loyalist paramilitary forces. I Liked this book as it was easy to read and gives a good insight into the past 30 years of the troubles. Anyone who is just getting into Irish history and is unsure about what to read, The Dirty War is an excellent starting point as, from the start, it gives you no illusions, even the title tells the truth."
4,A very detailed and well researched book.,"This book is very well researched and gives a difinitive account of the British Government role in operating a dirty war against the INLA and IRA in Ireland. Specific instances of ""Shoot-to-kill"", survailance and covert operations are covered in-depth. The book's author obviously has a very detailed knowledge and insight into the inner workings of the SAS and E4A(RUC covert squad) in the North of Ireland."
4,Only for the historian or the student of man's evil,"Not for the casual reader, this is a factual account of the bloody and ""dirty"" conflict between loyalists and nationalists in Northern Ireland from about 1968 to 1990. Dillon is to be applauded for his investigative reporting, which he diligently performed, courageously interviewing and prying into the secret affairs of IRA and loyalists groups. It reveals the ugliness in the human heart."
5,A thoughtful narrative with a strong inner theme,"Heket: The Goddess Who Birthed The Gods is first novel of a trilogy by Yolanda Muhammad, and is based upon Egyptian mythology, history, and legend. The little-known, frog-headed Goddess of Birth Heket must undertake a task given to her by Ra, the Father God, to locate and empower men and women who have a grand destiny to influence humanity and the Earth itself. A thoughtful narrative with a strong inner theme that bridges centuries and continents, Heket will especially appeal to readers with an interest in original fiction by a gifted author."
5,Great buy,"A Great buy, Perfect fit, Delivered as promised. All that at Great price and free delivery."
5,Excellent book on Depression,Dr.O'Shield's book is the best I have ever read on Depression. It is a must for anyone who suffers from depression or has a friend or loved one who has it. Also it is a great handbook for doctors and counselors. I have read it many times and refer to it often just for the inspirational and uplifting scriptures and suggestions in the last chapters. Without fail I find help and comfort there. Thank you for including it in your inventory.
5,Excellent,Excellent source of practical help in dealing with depression. Writing style is easy to understand and keeps the readers attention. Highly recommend.
1,Caution: VERY CREEPY!!!!!,"Come on people, look at it for 1 second! I Think it looks very creepy, and so should you. Since Kelly and Tommy are in thier ""costumes"" it looks like they got eaten by Spongebob and Patrick! [no offense on anyone who has worn this for Halloween].Look at it again , and you'll agree with me . 4 words : Very scary , not ordinary! 2 other words: STAY AWAY FROM AT ALL TIMES!P.S Tommy is NOT a girls name!"
2,Not her best.,"Meg goes to visit her dad in a small town in northern Michigan. He has been divorced from Meg's mother for a while and is living in a boarding house while he works on his writing career. Meg has to come to terms with him wanting to marry again. Also, the deceased husband of the owner of the boarding house is showing up in Meg's dreams and also as a ghost. What is he trying to tell them?This book is very similar to the other book I recently read by the same author. They both involve moving to a small northern Michigan town, making new friends, defining family relationships, and a ghost. Honestly, the other book was much better than this one."
4,LIMITED.,After da last don ( HIS LAST SOLO ALBUM ??) He put out 3 more in the next 3 years - This being on level with the other 2 .... some good songs but nothing special.IF YOU LIKE NO LIMIT THOUGH GET IT.
4,Tight!,"Master P has been very busy over the last few years, but still he came back with a smashin' new album. Although I'm from Berlin, Germany, I write in the US Amazon, since most albums are released here first. I like the songs ""B"" I like and ""I don't give a what"", that's really what's going on personally for me right now and probably for millions of hip hop headz worldwide. Maybe some songs are not too fresh this time, that's why I gave it a 4, but all in all it's just a tight new NL-CD, no more to say 'bout dat. I guess there will come out some videos on MTV to album songs, but in Europe I haven't seen anyone yet. Let's see what's comin' and I'm out. NO LIMIT ROLL ON! ..."
4,xXWh0dIXx,"Naw, not one of his best cd's, but still tyte. No Limit and Master P has grown up. A more mature cd this time. However if you are a tru tank dawg this is a cd for you!"
3,he lose the touch,i have the new master p and its nothang 2 write home about.most of the beats ain't heavy like they use 2 be in the past.beats by the pound need 2 do the beats and he need 2 get back 2 the level the he was when he made ghetto d and the last don
1,he could not survive without mystikal and c-murder,"Things seem to be going well for Master P in 98. Albums from Silkk the Shocker, Mystikal, and C-Murder all struck platinum while albums from Fiend, Mia X , and Kane and Abel went gold. Then in 2000, things started to go wrong. Mystikal left for jive and C-Murder launched his own Tru-records label. Suddenly, the tank was not rolling as it used to.To support my argument I wish to list the sales of NL releases in 2000/2001. Master P's Ghetto Postage sold only 92,000 copies in its first week(Ghetto D sol 260,000 in its 1st week). Silkk's my world, my way sold 81,000 in its 1st week(not as hot as charge it 2 da game which topped 288,000).As you can see, the tank suffered greatly. P's Ghetto Postage is a hackneyed album, full of all the cliches of the NL camp. As a lyricist, P never had anythin going for him. Instead it was the artists on his label which gave him much of his street credibility.P ought to throw in the towel. Nobody wants to hear him."
3,Master P isn't sounding good,"This CD is ok. But, what ever happened to the Last Don days?? He should continue making music like that. Even though most of the Soldiers are gone, he could still make good quality rap music. No Limit is still the best though!!"
3,Same Old No Limit,"No Limit has always been famous for using pretty much the same beats in every one of their songs, and this is true of this album. Master P again performs some solid songs, but it just doesn't have the flair of Ghetto D and his other early work. But if you like Master P, this is a must have. If you don't like Master P, don't worry about it...you aren't missing much."
5,Ghetto Postage,"Belieeeeve that, all the songs on Ghetto Postage are either tight as f**k or good! Da best tracks are Doo Rags, I Don't Give A What, Life I Live, Pockets Gone Stay Fat and Hush. So get it and f**k what dem haters say and if you don't got it yet,buy C-Murders Trapped In Crime. Also I wanna say that Silkk's My World, My Way is already out here in Germany (since octobre). It's full of tight tracks and it's way better than Charge It 2 Da Game and Made Man, so get it too when it comes out (US= 30 jan. 2001)."
5,This cd is awesome! GET IT!,I couldn't believe this cd when i heard it. I have always loved Master P. I never expected anyone to make a cd this good. I didnt know music could get this good. BUY THIS CD!
5,I love this man,"I can't get enough of this guy's work. It's so multi-layered, seamlessly bringing traditional French chanson singing together with a percussive sensibility that will not leave your brain.Even with a rudimentary knowledge of the language you can enjoy it. More DOminique! Encore!"
4,Lionel the Movie DVD,"This 3 Dvd set goes over the history of lionel train cars/locos and sets. It showed how many of the automatic cars/buildings never really worked well considering the technology of the time, but how the trains themselves have lasted a lifetime and more. Also showed many original photos/movies of advertisements/displays on tv. Most of it shown on home/show/window train tables. Small amount of history on Lionel B Cowen. This is not a movie in a sense, but a documentary on the historic trains/accessories throughout the pre and post era times. If your a collector, it is of great importance in knowing what worked well and what didn't, what is wanted and what isn't. My children enjoyed the visions and visions of trains and accessories and the old AD's. They were and still are Trains for All, and bring back fond memories of my own childhood days filled with American Flyer, Marx and Lionel trains. A four star only because I would have enjoyed more history on Joshua L.B. Cowen."
3,"Difficult Reading, but right on the money","Mandel's work is extremely comprehensive in nature and long winded at some points. He goes to great lengths to support his ideals, but loses the reader's interest several times. If you can read through all the legal mumbo-jumbo, Mandel has some incredible and unique insights on the Charter of Rights to offer. This is a great book for anyone interested in Canadian government or Politics."
2,Rain proof enough but sized for Gigantor! A Small = Large,"I'm a size medium on higher priced clothing (where the shirts and sweaters are more fitted; e.g. clothes from Nordstroms), but a Small for most sports equipment (e.g. a north face jacket).I ordered a sized Small for this and the think fits like a MuMu...it looks like I'm wearing a Large and need to go at least one size down. I've noticed this with sports equipment lately and it drives me nuts: everything is made for these giant fatsos or something. Example: go to Athletic Supply and every item is L, XL, XXL and even XXXL. You'll never find a small and maybe, MAYBE, one medium on the rack.I think the manufacturer of this coat just figured that they'd sell these to Americans and Americans are all oversized, so I can't blame them too much. However, they should offer an extra small if that's the case."
1,Cashing in,"Any product that is an an expansion and extension of what Norman G. Finkelstein calls the Holocaust Industry, which is turn has created new markets for intellectual consumibles, can be welcomed with a mixture of interest and healthy scepticism.The market for such consumibles in the USA and in a still guilt laden German market makes it worthwhile for the continuous production of artefacts, that, whilst not necessarily shedding any new light on old problems, do oil the wheels of the economy.Best regards,Martyn Joneshttp://www.itspolitics.com"
4,A must read for Buffy fans,"Finally! A Buffy book that's actually good! I was beginning to doubt that such a thing existed. All of the characters were well written and I didn't even have to roll my eyes once while reading it. The premise was also interesting and well executed. I'd recommend this book to all Buffy fans, even the ones who have given up hope on the books."
4,Something wicked this way comes,"This idea, an alternate reality to the usual Buffyverse, could have gone horribly awry (read any Buffy fanfiction?). Instead, the publisher put it in the hands of an author who not only came up with an intriguing plot, but who pursued some fascinating characterizations. Yvonne Navarro has always been a great writer of action, but in this she gets to demonstrate that she's remarkably adept at crafting quieter moments as well. And in the end, she accomplished the two most important goals of all: She entertained me, and she left me hungry for more."
2,Can't really recommend it.,"I'd read Yvonne Navarro's ""Willow Files"" and thought she'd done a pretty good job at adapting the scripts, even if they were written down to a ""young adult"" level (if young adults can watch the show, why can't they read a book written on the same level?) Unfortunately, this entry didn't live up to her earlier work. I found it neither particularly well thought-out nor particularly well-written. It should fare quite well with the contingent of ""we-know-better"" fans who insist that Willow's arc ""should have been done differently,"" but that's understandable as - IMO - it reads a great deal like the ""alternative season six"" fanfiction that litters the internet. A ""what-if"" scenario *could* work, but this one doesn't do it for me."
1,Waste of Time,"As someone else posted the book is riddled with spelling errors which could be forgiven if the plot was actually interesting. The wicked Willow thing was already a rip off of the Dark Phoenix story in X-Men and this novel carries the plot to the point of absurdity. In any case, there is no what if to wicked Willow, the story was played out on the show. The logical conclusion of wicked Willow not stopping is the end of the world. There's a reason that this was a path not taken. The polt gymnastics used to keep the plot going don't make any sense. In addition, Willow is completely out of character here as are Anya, Buffy and Xander. (...)Dont waste your time."
1,Prue Drivel,"Negative stars.The Dark Magic Willow was a bad enough idea, to take a bad idea and run with it is far worse. But not only is the concept bad, the writting is on the level of Fan-Fiction. I was shocked to learn that Ms. Navarro had written other books because this looks like a first attempt to me.Save your money and time. Even if you like Willow there is none of the Willow we knew here. Even for an AU."
5,This is a good book,While I liked it enough to give it five stars you have to seperate the show from the book a little while reading it if you can do that you will like this book
3,Like the title,"I like the title a lot and there are some very nice analogies in the book. All in all, I was hoping for more depth and more discussion about the deep spiritual warfare and pain that goes on when a loved one dies."
3,I liked it at first,"This was working quite well for me. I was using it to capture live sound from bands. Sometimes I preferred it to the sound from the board when I didn't like the mix, but it was also good for synching up with the sound from the board. However, a couple weeks ago it just stopped working altogether. I forgot to fill out the registration/warranty card and can't find it now. My mistake, my loss I guess. I need a new one but am not sure what to get now."
2,Wish they didn't break,"One of these came with my minidisc recorder in the early 2000's and I liked it quite a bit. Then it eventually died, so i bought another one which seemed to work fine. However, after a move across country, the next time i took it out of its box, it no longer worked. After banging my head against all the potential issues, i finally just decided it had broke and bought another one (there are very few cheap stereo condenser microphones with a 3.5 mm output).Exact same story - worked when I first got it, then packed it up and now trying it again, it is kaput as far as I can tell. I don't think I am especially hard on these microphones - they look like they are in great shape, however if you don't keep it in the original packaging it will probably bite the dust pretty quickly. Too bad."
2,Good Quality - Bad Sensitivity,"I received this mic after reading some good reviews about it. After testing it, I realized that the sound quality was okay, but the pick-up volume was very poor. I tried using it as a video recording mic as well as a computer microphone - neither situation gave me better pick-up. I'll be returning it."
3,Lack of Isolation,I placed the mic in a camcorder bracket hotshoe mount. The problem was that there is no form of isolation provided between the mic and the bracket. Any slight vibration is picked up by the mic through its snug-fitting slide-on shoe mounting bracket. I guess it's intended for a boom or a remotely operated tripod setup.
4,External Sound for Canon,The external mike for my Canon Optura 300 is great -- compared to the built in mike up over my eye that picks up my breathing and sniffling vs. the sounds of those I'm trying to video tape. I tested it on my grandaughter (3) and she launched into a song and dance routine. Now if I could just get her to stop twirling the wind screen ... it'd be perfectI highly recommend this mike to all.
3,"Good microphone that works for line in recorders, but it is cardioid","This is a good mike, with nice stereo recording, and it works on my iPod, voice recorder, which is line in only, supplying no phantom power for external microphones.However, this mike was clearly intended for use by someone holding it directly up to his mouth, instead of in, say, a lecture hall to take notes.For that type of application, you will want to switch from this type (cardioid or directional) to omnidirectional.Still, this would be an excellent mike for recording an interview, or for applications where you are trying to avoid ambient noises from interfering with your recording.Amazon got it to me in exactly the time promised, so I have no complaints."
2,Noisy,"I found that the audio quality of this microphone was not much better than the built in microphones on my camera, while producing noticeably more noise.I returned this product and purchased aHigh-performance(SMX-10) Stereo Condenser Microphonewhich is a little more expensive but I couldn't be happier with the difference in performance."
2,Weak,"No matter how I much I mess with this, I can never get it to pick up enough sound. I have to basically hold it in my mouth to get decent volume level, and trying to share it between two people is basically impossible. The hardware seems pretty decent, and I can't really whine about the price, but this thing is less useful than the built-in mic on my mp3 player."
1,microphone,The microphone had a loud hum with the playback. I found it unacceptable for my purposes.
2,Barely hear anything,"I dont know if its working well together with a video cam, but I was using it on two different computers with 2 different connection (one with built in analogue interface, the other with external m-audio USB interface) and all I see is that the ATR 25 is not producing acceptable volume. The resulted recording is so quiet I can barely hear anything when playing back, and this I was speaking into the Mic touching my mouth and knocking on it and all Mic levels in system and recording application set on max and tried with a new battery. It seems this Mic needs a preamp to work fine. But I have none here to try it."
1,broken,"This microphone didn't work, and I returned it. All you could hear was static. My $3 microphone works better."
3,"Good, but the lack of battery indicator is an awful oversight","I can't complain about the sound quality for the price, but the fact that you have no idea if it is really on when you turn it on, because the battery may have run down, can ruin your next video. Unless you can plug in a monitor phones into your camcorder (which I cannot) you may not know that you just made a silent film until it's too late."
2,"Mic is not great, would rather save money for a rode video mic","The sound quality of this mic is about the same as the onboard mic on my T2i . The only good thing about this mic is that it eliminates the motor sound from using the onboard mic and you are able to boom this mic to get closer to the sound source.This mic should only be use on a boom for a improved sound quality over the onboard mic, but I would rather save the money for something else like the Rode Video Mic"
2,I cant hear anything!,"The sounds quality isnt that bad if you turn up the mic volume on your camera and the way then yell at the mic, otherwise you dont hear anything at all. I would not buy this mic if i were you."
5,correct titles,The titles listed for this CD are actually the tracks from the Hub's first album Computer Network Music.The correct track listing is:1. And God Created Great Whales (For Orchestra And Whales)2. Concerto No. 8 For Orchestra: Andante3. Concerto No. 8 For Orchestra: Moderato4. Concerto No. 8 For Orchestra: Andante5.

Alleluia And Fugue For String Orchestra: Fugue10. Anahid
3,Hacker Damage?,"There appears to be something wrong with this Web page. ""Perry Mason In East Germany""? ""Borrowing and Stealing""? ""Whackers""? ""Hot Pig""? These aren't the titles of anything by Alan Hovhaness. The music appears to be from Alan Hovhaness, but there's something wrong with those titles."
5,The Best Catholic Prayer in Spanish out there.,"This book is a corner stone for Catholics, especially in Mexico. Used as reference guide on how to pray the rosary or to learn different prayers. The book's prayers vary, giving you a scope of what prayers you need to help you in different situations or occasions."
5,Exceptional,"For the Hospice Community, this scholarly book is exceptional. The author's mature wisdom is abundant throughout these pages, which include both practical techniques and positive visions for healing. Although the book provides a traditional medical-psychological approach, it reaches above and beyond other publications by offering spiritual perspectives that are truly inspiring."
3,Nice digital thermometer and humidity detector.,"The VOC measurement, however, is basically just a gee-whiz without much use, as noted by other reviewers. The meter measures the concentrations of VOCs based on a reference contaminant, which happens to be acetone -- one of the easiest to detect in this kind of device. It's utterly useless for detecting a number of other materials -- most notably formaldehyde, which is not detectable by the instrument until long, long after it's past Federal safety standards. Formaldehyde is, unfortunately, one of the most common VOCs to encounter (among other sources, it is released by particleboard) and is, in addition to being an irritant like other VOCs, also classed as a carcinogen.The thermometer and humidity level detection is fine, but don't expect this thing to do anything else for your IAQ monitoring."
4,Nice all around cleaning kit.,"Otis is likely the biggest name in firearms maintenance products for good reason; their products work. This is a no-nonsense field kit that works well on rifles as well as handguns. The bag it comes in is pretty well made and very compact. I can actually put the kit in my back pocket at the range.I actually use this kit at home more often than not, also. It comes with everything needed to clean my rifles and handguns. The only thing it won't really take care of is shotguns."
5,Very well designed and organized,Product works great in the field and takes up very little space. Great work. Much effort was put into the design.
1,Awful,"Do NOT buy this album. It's absolutly terrible. I swear my dog could have made a better album. Guitar playing is terrible, singing could be improved. This is an embarassment to Detroit Rock City. 96 West....go to Cleveland, i'm sure they will love you!"
1,Full of Discrepancies,"I read the review of Thea and I agree whole-heartedly that the book was filled with discrepancies. When the book mentioned Fraser's brothers, Alexander (Arabella's twin) was left out of the book. In the Highlander, Arabella and Alexander were inseparable. Thea's review sums up the rest of the discreapancies quite accurately."
3,Better than the Zen Garden,"The girl is young. She is cute. She is nude. She does yoga in a rocky area next to what appears to be the ocean or a large lake. The camera work is pretty good. For some reason the camera on these two videos likes to shoot facing the sun so the model is often in her own shade. This video is better than the zen garden one by a long shot if you just want to watch, (and see what you are looking at). Even so, there are still a lot of silhouette shots because of the camera angle.There is no verbal cuing, but the name of the asana is flashed on the screen as the model goes into the pose."
1,"beautifully filmed, but boring","I saw the five star rating but was dissapointed, blaa blaa blaa boring. If you listen to the sounds of the ocean in alternative audio mode with your eyes closed this dvd is for you."
4,Good Product,This is a nice video with good illustrations. The images are clear and the model presented the exercises well enough to follow.
1,Regrettable,They were very poor contents.It is like [ which is wanted to retake ].The semantic model who is these contents is pitiful.
3,Seized engine,"I bought this trimmer about two years ago, and have used it all of 4 times before the engine seized up.The engine may have seized up because I use it for long periods of time (2+ hours), and this time it was very hot outside. After about an hour of trimming, the engine stopped running and I was no longer able to pull the start cord. I dismantled the unit and found that only with a long screwdriver used against the flywheel was I able to turn the engine at all.While it was working I found it quite easy to operate. It was fairly easy to start, even when cold, and could run for about 2 hours before running out of gas. The engine is powerful enough to cut through small saplings, though it means full throttle and a slow cut. The handle is adjustable, and helps ensure easy use.I did find it was quite heavy however, at least over long periods of time. For my new weed eater I decided to go for the light weight model."
1,Not a winter gloves at all.,I was wearing this around low 40 degree weather outside. The cold air goes right through the gloves. You feel as though you aren't wearing anything.It's not winter glove. period.
5,Experience and Ingenuity,"One of the best guides for someone breaking into teaching currently on the market. I have had the distinct honor of working with Dr. Morrison and these experiences have done nothing but enlighten me and teach me things I might not otherwise have learned. He brings this ability to communicate both gracefully and pactfully to his text, mixing it with his natural love of children and his honest desire to help people learn how to do that single most important of jobs - teach.I recommend this book to anyone even vaguely considering education as a career, and to those who have experience in the profession. It will reveal many things you will not find anywhere else but experience and it will shed new light on old subjects for those with time infront of students."
1,The problem with Eddie,"The problem with Keen Eddie is Fox for canceling it. We deserve more than thirteen episodes. Obviously I'm not rating the DVD itself, which is due to arrive in two weeks, but my frustration in the fact that the majority of the American viewing public didn't have the opportunity to fall in love with a great program.It gives meaning to the hobby of matchbook collecting. Check it out.P.S. Sienna Miller- how do you like me now?"
5,Funny and clever!,I love this series! Very funny! The entire cast is so excellent. I had only seen a few episodes on BBC America. I was hooked. So I finally bought the entire DVD series and I wasn't disappointed. Every episode was well done. I highly recommend this DVD set.
2,Very Disappointing,"The series was great to watch... when it could be found. FOX shuffled it around to different time slots and after a few episodes started to play them out of order.This box set has the episodes out of order as well. While the main part of the individual episodes are contained to the story, continuing story lines (like that with his roommate / the final shot of the city map) don't make sense at all. Add to that the fact that the original music has been stripped (which were greatly matched 80's tunes) and you end up with a bad taste in your mouth.For anyone who like the original series... DON'T BUY!If you have never seen the show before, have money to waste and are bored, you will find it entertaining, yet confusing at times.If it is re-released in order, WITH the ORIGINAL SOUNDTRACK... I will buy it in a heartbeat!"
1,Missing something,"I ordered Keen Eddie and was happily anticipating it's arrival. But although the box and the individual sleeve of each disk indicated Closed Captioning as an option, when we tried to find that feature, the set-up menu said it was not available. So, so disappointed, I had to return the set."
3,TV Show GREAT! - DVD Sucks!,"Keen Eddie is such a great show that it's really a shame that Fox cancelled it (more like their fault for being stupid and airing it out of order like they did with Firefly and airing it in the summer doldrums). I give this show 5 stars.Now, for the DVD, it's just a really really bad set of DVDs. You know who does great DVDs? FOX Home Studio. This DVD set (might) just have been done by Paramount alone without the help of J Wyman, Simon West, or the cast. They didn't even spend money for licensed music, replacing music aired on tv. There are no extras (unless you count the 5.1 audio), no commentaries. I hope if this set at least gets popular they'll re-released another set with extras. I give the DVDs 3. Great transfer of video and 5.1 audio is also a plus otherwise I would have given it a 2.Shame on you Paramount. As someone already said, yeah, IT IS an insult."
2,Annoying and confusing camera work,"The story is fine. The characters are Okay. But not that funny.... I wish at least they have made Eddie's British police partner as a gay. ..And the camera work is very annoying. They are using so much ""zooming"" effect and that is very confusing."
3,Why the music was replaced...,"Sometimes music is licensed for 13 episodes and the contract does not state DVD release, international distribution, etc. In these cases as much as we would like to blame corporate there is nothing they can do. They may have no option to purchase the rights for DVD release. I have obtained this info from add people and soundtrack writers. I am as sorry as you are. I was able to purchase the one day release of the 3rd season of La Femme Nikita that was pulled for similar issues. It was released later."
4,Why did they cancel this,"This is one of the quirkiest, funniest shows of recent years. And like all good shows (Dead Like Me, Firefly, Family Guy, etc.) It got cancelled before it could develop a massmarket audience.I don't remember the music, like so many are complaining about, though I do feel that something is missing from the box set. Perhaps that's it. Perhaps it's the lack of bonuses. Nevertheless, this show is so much better than almost anything on TV right now. I watched some of this set last night and laughed my butt off. Mark Valley is just hilarious, the writing is great, the actors are all top notch, and Pete the dog is hysterical. In a perfect world, this would be given a sceond chance on the networks. Alas..."
5,A Very Creative Comedy,"I missed the original airing of Keen Eddie on Fox, but caught an episode later on Bravo and was motivated to purchase the box set. I am glad that I did. The characters are lots of fun, have good comedic timing and a warped sense of humor.It's my understanding that much of the original music has been removed from the DVD set, probably because they didn't want to pay for the rights. Also, the order that the episodes play are the same as they aired, which is not in the order they were intended. The result is that at times you wonder why certain characters are missing, then reappear without explaination.I gave this 5 stars because I feel that if you haven't seen all the episodes, then you will certainly enjoy it. So, how do you like me so far?"
2,Incomplete and vague,"This book has basic words, but does nothing for conjugation and usage. For example ""bad"" in English can be translated into bad, or spoiled (as in milk) but one would never know the difference using this book. Decent for finding nouns, and for helping with pronounciation, but absolutely nothing on grammar."
3,Durability,"This is what my twelve year old son has to say-Toa Inika Jaller is very fun but, by carrying a heavy sword/laser, quite hard to pose. After playing with it as, imagine, an8-9 year-old would, shows its almost complete vulnerability. My Jaller has multiple cracks in its ""connectors."" These cracks make it even harder to pose Jaller and make it collapse under its own wieght."
4,cool,"Jaller's has two actions, lightsword lighting up for about 15sec, and Multiple Zamor Sphere launcher. But their heads (Speachless). Gold features . Blah blah balh balah"
1,false advertising.,"Beware...this is NOT a true 'live album"" --It is basically the ""Big Blues"" session but with a canned applause track added. The truth becomes evident if one were to play the Big Blues c.d simultaneously with this one.It's been tampered with and it's such a shame because the original Big Blues album is a classic. This type of treatment cheapens the musical value & content."
5,An excellent resource!,"I bought this book when I was preparing for my pregnancy. It had excellent tips on healthy eating, not only from a pregnancy perspective, but from nutrition in general. It covers the preconception stage, gearing up for pregnancy, then pregnancy itself, and lastly has a section on what to eat postpartum. One thing I loved about the book is that it explains how eating right will bring you back to your pre-pregnancy shape much faster. I gained 35 pounds with my pregnancy and lost it all within the first 3 months, and I've continued to lose. This book is an excellent resource for nutrition in general, even beyond the pregnancy part."
2,Not the best source out there,"I found the advice in the book to be preachy and a little too old school nutrition (basic food groups, lean meat, dairy etc.)In a time when there is so much new evidence about alternate protein and calcium choices..Would only recommend this book to someone who is eating very poorly and needs to begin with basic information."
3,"It's Ok, but not great, with one big flaw","I'm in my first trimester and I received this book as a gift from a friend. I think that generally the advice is ok, but not as up to date as another reviewer mentioned. The recipes look good, but there are not that many (I haven't actually made any so I can't review on the recipes). Suprisingly, in her menu section, a lot of days call for fish. I'm not crazy about fish, so that's not helpful. My biggest complaint is that she recomends ""diet"" drinks or the use of artificial sweeteners. That stuff is pure poison and I would not expose my unborn child to artificial sweeteners in a million years. So if you do decide to purchase the book, I would recommend you ignore that bit of advice."
5,Recommended if you are pregnant or thinking of becoming pregnant,This is by far the best of any of the various nutrition books or cookbooks for pregnancy that I have read through.I bought this before I became pregnant and liked it so much before and during my pregnancy that I have given this as a gift. Such a great reference - I can't count the number of times I have gone back to this. I also like the recipes Somer includes - some have become household favorites.
4,Pregnancy and Nutrition,The book was okay but I felt it was a lttle out dated. I really wanted more information on Nutrition and not as much on Pregnancy which I have gotten from books specifically on Pregnancy.
3,"Just another diet book, targeted to a different audience","This book did not offer anything new from the usual ""everything in moderation"", except for no smoking, no drinking and take your prenatal vitamins. Chances are, if you were healthy before pregnancy, you will continue to be healthy in pregnancy, if you were not healthy before, now it is a good time to become healthy, but if you were struggling with losing weight, this book will seem like any other diet book in the market."
4,Great recipes,This book had a lot of useful information about what was going on with my body and what to eat but the recipies in the back of the book alone make this book worth buying. The only thing it did not help me with was to recongnize when something was wrong with the baby. I lost my baby at 11 weeks but nothing I read in any of my books clued me into the warning signs that something had gone wrong.
1,return,"I received this book for a present and after suffering through a half hour hoping to find something original enough to engage my interest, I simply gave up and returned the book. Not remotely recommendable."
4,"Very Cute, but a little small.","I have the "" love"" bag as well. I like it better, it seems to have more room. Although maybe it has just loosened up and stretched a little with use. I do like the shoulder strap on the camo bag, but the flap can get in the way when you are in a hurry and need something quick, like in the car! I bought the camo bag for spring and summer, I used the love bag all fall and winter. The bags do hold up very well, I have had other bags that tore or the liner ripped out of the inside, no problems with Wendy's bags!!! They are worth the exta money!!"
3,Pretty but bulky,"Eventhough the bag is very stylish, it's not very comfortable. It's very bulky and doesn't fit a lot in it. Also the material is not very durable. It is cute though!"
5,great purchase,"This diaper bag is great, there is plenty of room in it, I like all of the separate pockets, I like everything organized. I also really like that this diaper bag does not look like a diaper bag. It was worth the expense."
4,Love this bag!,"I love this bag! I almost bought the Petunia bag for $155 and couln't bring myself to spend that much money on a diaper bag, and bought this one instead. I get so many compliments on it. I do not like super cutsey, babish things- thats why I love this bag. Only gave it 4 stars though, because I wish it was a little bit bigger. By the time I have diapers, extra clothes, receiving blanket, burp cloth, wipes, cream, my phone, wallet, sunglasses and keys there is no room and it's super heavy. Still love it though.... :-)"
3,Too many compartments!!,"This bag looks great! Unfortunately, there are so many compartments for evertything you can think of that you can't find anything in the bag once you put it in there.I have to kids ( 2 and 10 months ) and have a hard time putting 6 diapers & all their other stuff in there.Its big, but not roomy like you think it would be. When I do stuff it, I can't even close it- the magnetic closer constantly opens up.Personally, I use it only for looks and not as an everyday diaper bag!"
3,Looks are deceiving!,This bag is huge to not have anymore room than it does! I loved the pink camo pattern and the other fabric was so soft. I also loved all the labeled compartments. I just knew this bag was going to be perfect! Well when I got it home and tried to put all our stuff in it I realized the exterior looks of this bag made it very deceiving.There was very little actual room on the inside. Our daughter was year old when I bought this and we couldn't even fit enough stuff for church in this bag. And then when we would get enough to get by with in the bag it would be so heavy that I hated caring it!It's a cute bag but it just isn't practical! We like our Colorado tote much more than this thing!
5,Love it!,"I recieved my bag yesterday and it is great. The organization is awesome, and the bag is big, without being TOO big. I love the colors and the material is really soft. I love how it fits, just the right size!"
2,not worth it,"I fell in love w/ this bag- it's girlie but not froofie, and good a space for my stuff. Well, it doesn't hold much. I can get my wallet and cell, 3 diapers, travel wipes and 2 bottles. I cant fit an extra outfit, blanket, extra bottles, or toys to entertain her. I took it on a trip for the plane and had to bring another bag for my daughters stuff- bottles, outfit and blanket. I am so disappointed, since I use both of the free diaper bags I got from the hospital more than this one. And my husband was not thrilled with how much I spent on this, but I figured it would be my ""purse"" for 2-3 years."
4,Eyecatching and practical!,"This bag was on my 'wish list' since before I was prego. I thought no one would buy it for me due to price, but I got it! I heard neg. things about messenger bags (have to flip over flap, etc.) but I don't have a prob. doing that. This bag is bigger than it looks and has SO many pockets/compartments. It's so practical and durable! It wipes clean easily and the great thing is I adjust the straps to longer and wear it as a messager! SO much easier than worrying about it falling off of my shoulder! The only down side is that because of it's size, you can fill it up pretty good and it will get heavy as a result. So sometimes for quickie trips, I take another bag. I kinda do wish Wendy made a smaller backpack version."
5,love it,I have had my pen radio for years and it has never failed until now. After 5 years the battery has died.I was looking for the batteries ( I have stupidly misplaced the ones I took out) and saw a negative review for the pen. I keep the unit with my laptop and love both the concept and the function.
1,not great did not work,"not a great product. i had brought it for my cousin who was in college, he could never get it to work."
3,Some of Hovhaness' most delightful work,"This CD is worth owning for the two symphonies it contains, both of which are very good examples of the sort of work most Hovhaness-lovers expect from him, and you won't find them in any other collection as far as I know. I give the CD only 3 stars simply as a WARNING to those who may not appreciate the coloratura soprano singing of Hovhaness' widow on some of the shorter works. I do not take offense to it as another reviewer did, simply because coloratura is what it is...but for the uninitiated, it can take some getting used to."
5,Outstanding book,I bought this book because it was on sale! What a deal. It never occur to my mind that this book will become the first one I need when I encounter some difficulty understanding technical or scientific materials. Almost any definition related to science and technology in this book. This excellent reference must have for any one working in the field of science or engineering. It is very helpful especially when you have to study new subjects in yours field of knowledge required by your job or for general studying. This book has the keys to unlock your mind for knowledge and understanding. I would pay full price for this book if I knew how useful and great is as I do now.
4,Student/Social Worker Friendly,Ms. Kaiser teaches at my school but I have never had her. The scenarios and issues presented in the book are realistic to a social work practice setting and can be transferred from setting to setting. Terminology is easier to understand. I have kept the book since I took the supervision class.
5,Required Reading for Supervisors,I have used this book as a professional reference for my work and as a textbook with practitioners and students. It is solidly grounded in relational ethics and research. Its multicultural examples are based on research and well integrated into the topical headings of the book. Few books dedicate this kind of attention to the relationship between supervisor and supervisee. It works well with other kinds of texts that address the managerial dimensions of supervision. The concept of shared meaning is particularly useful in identifying where things can go wrong in the supervisory relationship and to how understand and address them. Every supervisor and supervisee should have and use this resource.
2,They didn't get it,"I read this to my girls ages 9, 6, and 5. They are interested in the local election because a relative is running for office. So, I checked out books from the library related to elections and this was one of them. We are not very familiar with the Amelia Bedelia series. I knew it was popular, so I read it aloud, lively, expecting my kids would love it. But, they didn't. Not one laugh, snicker, or even a single sign that they realized these were puns. Nothing. I almost didn't finish it. As one reviewer said, Amelia almost seems stupid. If I had not read the other reviews here which state this Amelia is not like the original Amelia, I would never bother to read another in this series."
1,Secret Ballot,"Aunt and nephew's works never appealed to me. In this silly installment, the well-fed Rogers continue giving Amelia instructions which she keeps taking literally. One such suggestion has her running for mayor and the results are worse than stupid. Too bad she didn't bake something for the mayor."
2,Inappropriate for Given Age Range,"Kids that are learning to read enjoy plays on words and this book is full of plays on sayings. But not many first graders (7 year olds) are going be familiar with sayings like: ""throw your hat in the ring"" or ""cut the red tape"". Just explaining some of these sayings to a young child is a challenge. This isn't a good book to foster early reading comprehension. Instead try some of the first in the Amelia Bedelia series."
1,Stick with the older Amelia books...,...because it's obvious this series has run its course. A real let-down
1,"""Literary"" but Not Companionable for the Traveler","The stories would most be appreciated by one who is a candidate for a Master's degree in English or World Lit. I bought it hoping to gain insight into the people of Prague---one or two stories accomplished this goal. Most of them were ""highbrow""---good pieces of literature, perhaps, but not necessarily enlightening for the traveler to Prague."
1,Garbage,"I returned this ""Hi-Fi System"" because the CD player didn't work. That may have been bad luck, but it is still pretty junky. It doesn't even have a bass or tremble dial.... not even a tone dial!"
1,Not satisfied.,Unit received and it didn't work. Seller of product insisted I had to pay return shipping. Unit cost $40 and return shipping was $25. Don't see why I should have to pay for shipping return on a non-functioning product.Very dissatisfied. They still haven't replace the unit. Don't know if I'd like the product because I still don't have it after a month! Check return policies BEFORE buying from Electronic Express.
4,Coby CD400,"For the $$, this is pretty decent. Good luck in figuring out how the speakers attach. fortunately, not an issue for me.After using this for awhile, I find that the tuner is really cheap. Hard to get even local stations on AM--the dial is too small and not geared at all. Not very powerful--low ability to hold stations once tuned. FM is better slightly. The unit is so light that turning it on and off pushes the thing around. Had to hot glue it down."
1,Disappointment,When my order arrived the CD player didn't work. I phoned the Coby Company customer service rep and she was at a total loss and had no idea how to solve the problem. Then Amazon sent me a replacement item and once again the CD player didn't work. I once again called Coby customer service and was told that if I paid $10 I could return it to them directly.At this point I had two items sitting in my house that didn't work. So Amazon emailed me two return labels & I returned them both. In a few days one of them was returned to me because the label was wrong. So once again Amazon sent me another return-label and that is the last I have heard from anyone. My question now is obvious: How do I get my purchase price returned that I paid for defective merchandise?
3,No cord???,"I orderd this for a Christmas present. I was assured it would get here before Christmas. It did but buy one day. When it was recieved the cord wasnt in the box. I ordered a silver model but recieved a black one. Luckily I didnt mind the color, but the cord was an issue. I went to radio shack to buy the cord. Once I had everything hooked up. The soud is ok..nothing special. Also make sure you are home. You have to sign for package."
1,This is embarrasing!!,"Not purchased at Amazon. The CD player didn't work at first.I'm going to let this cd play before I pack it up to be returned. Luckily I have a plan ""B"" It's just junk from head to toe. If you really hate the person you have to buy a gift for this is the right item to buy.Flimsy wiring. The speakers are non-existant in weight and quality. No bass, no controls. The tuning knob crunches along like an old rusty tube radio.This would have been my first Coby item."
2,Digital Tuner,"This item would be perfect for what I use it for, if it had a digital tuner. I spend most of the time trying to dial in a radio station, then just as soon as I sit down, I have to get up and retune it to the same station."
4,Great gag gift.,"Book arrived in great condition, in a timely manner. Content was humerous, as this was a gag gift was my intention. Will purchase products from distributor in the future!"
3,OK,"This book is adequate if you just want some pedestrian, sterile examples, but if you want to read about real courage and inspiration read ""The Greatest Generation"" or ""The Triumph and the Glory"", and then apply the timeless lessons proclaimed between the front and back covers of those two terrific books and maybe you will learn something. I'm sorry, but these motivational books are hideously overrated."
1,Another inspirational tome stamped out with a cookie cutter,"There is absolutely nothing different, unusual, special - and least of all, inspiring - about this book. The author writes as if the mere repetition of tales of pluck and boot-strapping were some new revelation. It is very difficult not to feel that the authors who write these books aren't just filling an insatiable need on the part of people who simply can't get their lives together and are stuck on a treadmill of buying one inspirational ""self-help"" book after another as a substitute for truly taking action in their lives. There is nothing to mark this book as better than the great glut of treacly advice books on the market."
1,For those into SELF-IMPROVEMENT this is NOT the book.,"I am a fervent supporter of Stephen Covey. I love the 7 Habits of Highly Effective People and First Things First but I must say Living the 7 Habits is a dissapointment. At first glance, it looks very impressive particularly the idea that it has many stories and the design of the book was attractive. However, having read the book, I find it dissapointing because the stories are not inspiring nor does it touches ones heart. Infact, the short stories in the other 2 books mentioned above are far better than those compiled here. I read the book with the hope that the stories will inspire me and can be useful for me to reach other people (people relate better to stories than straight facts) but I could hardly find any good ones. The stories does not result in paradigm shifts as in the earlier books."
2,The last interview only matters...,I am Covey student. But I am rather disappointed with this book as it was (a) loads of stories loads of repetition (b) loads of emotions short of practicality (c) loads of testaments lack of focus on the reader. I found only tiny section that applies. I like the last interview which I would give it a 4**** !
4,Great follow-up to 7 Habit Book and/or Workshop,I enjoyed reading this book. The stories make it very easy to understand the concepts of the 7 Habits and the fact that these are true stories submitted by individuals helps the concepts sink in much better. It helps to read the 7 Habits of Highly Effective People (or take the corresponding workshop) first and then read this book. It drives home the principles taught in the book and/or workshop.
2,"SOLID, BETTER THAN NEIL SNYDER'S BOOKS","Generally, this book does not read as well as Covey's earlier works. He should have looked to improvise upon his earlier works, rather than rehash earlier works. Nonetheless, he remains far and away better than Neil Snyder, who cannot write very well, nor express any thoughts of his own. GO WITH COVEY."
2,Leaving the 7 Habits or Living the 7 habits,"This is an unmeanlingful line extension of Covey's previous work, 7 Habits of Highly Effective People. This latest book can ruin both Covey and 7 Habits' brand equity. Why publish another book when there is nothing new to say ? Why kill the goose (Covey as a brand) that lays the golden egg ( 7 habits brand) ? For the past few years, Covey failed to innovate and come up with new ideas about personal development, leadership, and management. He has been locked in too ridigly in his old 7 habits paradigm. He should read Edward De Bono's Lateral Thinking, which will help him whack the side of his thinking and make him less habituated to his old thoughts. Hope he will have something new to say in his upcoming new books! Please create true value for the readers. Please! Dollars are getting tough to earn these days."
1,Trite,The audio is delivered in a monotone that almost puts you to sleep. Not a good thing while driving
2,"Book was great, but was missing a key part! No dust jacket!","I purchased this book primarily for the jacket cover due to the technical value to me - the photographer was a pioneer in the field. The picture you see is what the dust jacket looks like. That's what was advertised when I bought the item - no notes were given about 'missing dust jacket' which is the norm when the jacket is not there. I received the book - no dust jacket. So, the book is great, but the seller I bought it from is not."
5,An Unusual Compilation,"This eclectic selection is based in the early thirties, and draws together a number of recordings that have not been reissued elsewhere. That includes two with Jock McDermott, two with Sid Phillips & his Melodians, two with the Radio Rhythm Five, and two each with Harry Hudson and Claude Ivy (both as piano accompaniment). Add Roy Fox and Lew Stone, Carroll Gibbons, and Monia Liter, and you have a varied selection that is a joy to listen to, and which is bound to plug some gaps in all but the most comprehensive collections.NOTE: If you're reading this under the President CD of the same title it's because Amazon in their infinite wisdom have seen fit to cross-post it, with the result that I cannot review that reissue separately. Be assured, it also rates five stars."
2,Disappointing!,"This movie is full of inaccuracies and seemed to just want to cash in on Freddie's death. The film states it was based on articles, etc., so need I say more? They added things in that were untrue, which is disrespectful to Prinze. Time and care could have been taken to produce a factual movie. I'd only recommend this movie as a collectible if you are a fan, but don't take it as gospel."
3,archives,"This was A sad story that i thought that the Entertainer that did the portrayal of the original person did pretty good job. and unfortunate that the entertainer that portrayed the original person got a bad rap for doing the movie.I sort of wonder what Ever Happened to Ira Angustain??? Did he get a name change after doing this movie or did he change his career?The entertainer that he portrayed had the personality like a Male versionof Alice from the Twilight saga(I thought) always wanted to share things like his way was the way to do it, and he would get all excited or he would be down in the dumps.I personally liked the entertainer that was portrayed of. and I thought Ira Did a good job doing the not so nice stuff that could of been done not so nice.Senor- Freddie Mmmm its kind of touchy to say, I liked him alot but, to talk about him well that still is kind of questionable?Deborah Fenn"
3,Not the most interesting read.,"I was looking for a basic ""how to"" book on composting, while still interesting enough to hold my attention. Sadly, this wasn't it. The black and white pages read like a school book. And the information is pretty vague. I am new to gardening/composting, so this book could simply be too advanced for me."
3,"Cute sandal, doesn't wear well","This sandal is super cute, and if you'll only wear it occasionnally and mostly indoors, it's the one for you. But it doesn't wear well if you plan the wear it two or three times a week in the city, and the top of the sole changes color with wear."
1,Do not buy.,There is no indication in the review that you must have a complete weather station to attach the anemometer. There fore the anemometer is useless and returning it is very difficult and you have to pay the return postage.
1,misleading ad,"the anemometer is nice ,but they don't tell you that you have to buy additional equipment to be able to take advantage of the wirless feature. It's of little value if you have to climb a pole to read the wind speed! The also don't tell you about the 20 % restocking fee if you return it untill you try to send it back."
3,Good for Basic Info,"It is good information, yet would have liked more selection. there is good, basic information in it. So it is a good starter book."
4,Excellent Visual Instructions,"This book has excellent step by step instructions (diagram and real look) which helps you reproduce the knots after a minimum 30 minutes of attempt. The diagrams even have a different shade for every step, so it is very helpful to figure out how the cords go over and under to get the same effect.The photographs are very inspiring and I actually was able to produce one of the necklaces after just one week!!Definitely recommend for anyone who is interested in knotting and all the elegant jewelry possible with just cords and beads."
3,A Knotted Up,I purchased the book for a future project. I assume I will be able to do my project just based upon skimming thru it. I cannot make a valid judgment
4,Chinese Knots for Beaded Jewellery,Great book!! It's well laid out with lots of clear photos to follow and well written instructions. The design ideas got me really excited. There are so many projects I want to make and so little time to get them done.
1,Chinese Knots for beaded jewellery,"I had to return this book.No inspiration in the jewelry samples, and a better selection of knots are documented elsewhere."
2,Torture,"Fantasy should be fun, not torture. This was torture. It was a constant feeling of having no idea of what was going on, all the way to the end."
4,great well-written involved fantasy,"If you're looking for easy to read light-weight fantasy - this book is not for you. I found it an interesting, intricate complex read where the plot was anything but predictable and the characterizations and dialog rich, complex and totally engaging.One of the aspects that I enjoyed was the blurring of good and bad - there are no clear hero's and villains here - its much more complex as they are following their paths & agenda. Perhaps this grey-ness and lack or good vs. evil is what some readers find difficult to cope with."
4,Nice Prologue,"I really enjoyed this. The magic/sorcery was not overwrought. The supernatural was part of the story, not the story itself. There was plenty of gritty realism and plot-crossing intrigue. I will definitely continue reading this series."
2,Disapointing,"I am not saying this is a bad book, but i jusn't did not like it. I bought the first twobooks. I had to stop halfway through the second one.It' too dark for me. There never seems to be any redemption.Too many characters, too many plots.too confusing.Too many times I had to go back a few chapters to remember who the characters were, in orderto follow the thread of the story.I would not recommend these books"
2,Too much magic!,This book suffers from having way too much magic! Entire armies are devastated by magic. The ending suffers from having magic destroy the monstrous villains. It's way too boring and a cop out. Authors like George R. R. Martin minimize the magic to make the stories more accessible and credible. Mr. Erikson had better tone down the magic if he wants to be taken seriously.
1,Shallow characters and uncompelling scenes,"Sadly I only got through the first 150-200 pages before I lost interest in this book. The focus on grand events and powerful magic left the characters lacking in depth. Several scenes were not played out to their potential, clearly functioning as plot points taking the reader to the next scene, leaving the setting cardboardlike and the people uninteresting. Examples are the surprise meeting with the empress in her throne room and the scene in the death realm. Furthermore, all of the main characters seem to have the same mindset and voice, which gets boring fast.I can see the fun in throwing the reader smack into the action without explaining too much of what's going on at first, but this strategy will only work if the reader can latch on to compelling characters with their own unique voice."
1,Maybe I missed something?,"Maybe reading it on a Kindle for Droid threw me off initially, but I had an extremely hard time keeping track of all the characters, and the locales described. Switching to the hardcover part of the way through, I found myself referring back to the list of 50+ characters almost every chapter. On the Droid, it was too much hassle to keep going back, so I quickly lost track. I think that because within each chapter, the POV would switch to multiple characters, I could never get invested in the story. With all the high reviews, I wanted to like the story - but even in the final chapters, I didn't know who any of these characters were, and what their alliances were."
4,Sophisticated fantasy...quality stuff,"I really love this book. And if you're looking for something completely emersive and challenging, then this is the book for you. This is a fantasy novel for smart people! I have a master's in English lit, and I still wrestle with the series. The author expects a lot from his readers...patients, research, and a willingness to review earlier novels and chapters. But, like I said, if you're up to the challenge, you'll love it. The more I invest in this series, the more attached I become."
5,Bloody Fantastic,And I mean that literally -- such a fantastic series with amazingly detailed and in-depth writing that'll bring you right into the world and mind of Erikson.
4,Gardens of the Moon,"Gardens of the Moon is the first book in what looks like its going to be a several book series. I've seen the book on Amazon and in bookstores, but there was something about the cover art that turned me off. Too realistic or something, not entirely sure.Regardless, the story was enthralling after about a third of the way in! The author introduces a signficant number of characters in a short period of time and it took a while before I could start piecing the threads and getting involved in the story. In short, it took a while for me to care, but I hung in there.The book definitely has a Eberron-esque flair to it (except for the blackpowder munitions) which I finally was able to get immersed in.While the book is followed up by another in the series it can really stand on its own.Its comparative work to George R. R. Martin's, A Song of Fire and Ice, or Terry Goodkind's Sword of Truth series"
1,I got your sardonic reserve for you right here,"250 pages in and I'm done. The book is so poorly written it is all but unreadable. Here's a sample: ""Crokus shared something of the tower's imagined sardonic reserve for the pretense so rife in Majesty Hall, an emotion of his uncle's that had seeped into the lad over the years.""Huh? Say that twice fast. What is this sentence even about? The whole book is like this. It's beyond me how anybody can read thousands of pages of this stuff. The writing (and reading!) would be greatly improved simply by crossing out every adjective and simile. Not to mention each and every instance of ""imagined sardonic reserve""."
3,"Good, but not great...yet","According to the press info this is Erikson's first published book and to a certain extent it shows. The dialogue seems a bit forced (although this improves later on). And there's a large cast of characters that didn't seem very well differentiated to me- too many similar names and descriptions.Having said this, there are some very interesting ideas here- Warrens are very original. Some of the army organisation reminded me of vietnam-era stuff (especially the dragonflies) which was refreshing. The world building is on an epic scale. Plenty of people have compared this book to the George RR Martin series. I would align it more towards David Gemmel's territory.For a first book this is pretty good. I watch with interest..."
2,20-sided dice would have made it complete,"Maybe it got better after the first third of the book. I'll never know. I hardly ever put down a book once I've started it, but I couldn't imagine slogging through ten more books of this. The characters were flat, the environment under-described, and I found that I didn't care. I felt like I was reading through someone's notes from a D&D campaign."
2,"Great plots, invisible characters","I agree with other reviewers here on this main point, the characters are not fleshed out enough for me. I don't care about them one bit because I know nothing about them! (Except who they hang out with). Yes, there are exceptions like Anomander. But I still don't even know what a Trell is!! Erikson will say ""The Trell held his sword menacingly"" or something and I don't know if that's an ethnicity, a species or what.I guess he was trying to have us just go along for the ride, and he does write an amazing ride with original magic and history, etc... But I need more than that."
3,could have been great!,"I loved nearly everything about this book-the creativity,the intelligemce,the need to constantly surprise and entertain the reader with imagery and ideas.What stops it getting the full five fom me though is a uniform lack of depth to all the characters.This may be a personal point though ,but I NEED to get involved,to emotionally latch on to my characters-Again and again the story would NEARLY begin to grip me,but!....would then move on to yet another character in yet another place.The author has a fantastic imagination but didn't really back it up with a great story.But don't let me dissuade you.It's a fun,entertaining read and hopefully these characters will grow in the next installment."
4,Its gets better,I think this was a really good book if you read all. I almost like sime other reviews a read game up on it after the first 100 pages. In the beginning its hard to really get a feel for any of the charecters and Erikson switches to a new one just as its gets excating.After a slow begining the book really picks up pace the charecters get a little more alive and the story begins to pick up pace.The end is really worth waiting for where everthing happens at once i'm really looking forward to the sequal.
4,Nice alternative to GRRM,"I find Erikson to be a nice alternative to GRRM and ""Game of Thrones."" His world is still ""dark"" and gritty in many respects, but Erikson actually has likeable characters working to change it all. His prose is also excellent, far above that in most other fantasy books. I'd recommend fantasy fans at least try this one out and see how it fits their tastes. Overall I think the series is still too long and wordy (a big problem with most fantasy) but it's better than most."
2,"Somewhere, somehow, someone or something seems...","The problem, I think, is that the world and characters are so fleshed out and real to the author that he doesn't feel the need to fill in the gaps for the readers. Between the author's vision and what you read is a HUGE chasm. If only he had kept the pace and detail of the prologue. It reminds me of Moorcock, where too much happens too fast to people you care too little for. And it is high fantasy, where you have no idea what to expect to happen at any point in the story so you expect nothing, and don't care when it happens. He makes the reader surprise-proof, and the idea of ""plot twist"" is absurd. Wish it were otherwise."
5,Hang In There,"I purchased Erikson based on reviews I read on Amazon. When I first picked up ""Gardens of the Moon,"" I thought it was terrible. I could not track with what was going on. It literally took me three months to get through the first 100 pages. The only reason I picked it back up is because I didn't have anything else on hand to read.Steven Erikson is my favorite author. After I hit a hundred pages I didn't stop reading. Each book I read in the series absolutely blows me away. I still think that the first hundred pages of Gardens is brutal, but if you can get through it I believe you will find the next 5000 pages to be outstanding."
4,Great book... If you make it,What a great book. I found it a little confusing and overwhelming at first but the pay off is worth it. After the first 150 pages you won't be able to put it down.
2,I so want to like it but...,"I don't like this book. I want to like it, I am trying to like it, and having paid good money for it I don't want to give up on it easily. But so far I am failing badly. I should like it - an intelligent book filled with beautiful prose and original ideas rather than tired cliché. However, it is just such hard work. There are too many characters and too little character building, so that I find I can hardly remember from one reading session to the next who they are or what they have been doing. The plot seems to jump around with so little flow that it is hard to feel involved or to care about the story. In many ways it is similar to Martin's Ice & Fire books - an original fantasy world of huge scope, of light and shade rather than black and white, many characters and numerous plot threads, and mature writing. However, though Martin's story managed to hook me from the first chapter, Erikson has so far left me cold. I'll persevere, but..."
4,"Give it a shot, you won't be disappointed","I was just recently introduced to Steven Erikson's work. I have primarily read Dragonlance and Forgotten Realms novels. While I still enjoy those two worlds a great deal, I was starting to find myself getting into a rut and not being surprised anymore.So, I come to Erikson's work. Garden's of the Moon is the first book of his i have read and I am amazed at his ability to tell a story. Finding a new author you enjoy is a great gift indeed. I liken it to cleaning your couch and finding a $20 under a cushion. A wealth you never knew about.Like I said at the start, if you (like me) are a fan of Forgotten Realms and Dragonlance give this first book a shot. I am eagerly looking forward to getting ahold of the next couple of books in this series."
3,Duke4303,"Difficult to follow the characters as so many of them doing so much. Feel that part of the story lost in confusion. Main story line came through and proved to be a delight at the end. I believe to read the second book is a must, so of I go......."
4,"Takes awhile, but captivating","I picked up Gardens of the Moon expecting a fantasy of massive proportions, twisting plots that seemed to have no link and many viewpoints to keep straight. I was not disappointed.The only reason I have four stars rather than five was how long it took for me to get hooked. The start was confusing as I didn't get understand the workings of the Malazan world Erikson has created. Once I got into the book though, I couldn't put it down. Now, on to the next!"
4,A Good Read... If:,"I enjoyed this action packed novel. The only thing that I had a bit of a problem with is the assault of a plethora of characters and not being able to easily follow & remember who's who. It didn't help that the names were odd, and some were very similar. Giving just one example there are the T'lan Imass, and the Tiste Andii (sp?). This may not be an issue for some, but for me, I had to make myself keep reading in hopes that I'd catch on to the many ambiguous plots. Overall I found myself looking forward to picking it back up every time I left off and I'm glad I stuck with it. It's hard to find a great fantasy author. One other thing.. I wish there was better character development for the protags."
3,"A good, complex story - which stays distant","I read about this series and started with the first book. It is interesting too read, and the story is nice. But it is very complex, I had to check the glossary / map a thousand times, and often minor details play important roles later on. What I really didn't like was the character presentation and development. I wasn't able to get a real connection to any of the different characters. And that's really sad, because a story lives from it's actors, in my opinion. I am trying the second book at the moment to see if it is getting better, but I don't think I will complete the series, if things will not change."
4,Ze amazing!,"Its awesome, but confusing at first, with the talk of all the gods and things, it helps to read the index at the back of the book as well as reading the dramitca peronale at the begining, It starts making since about a third of the way through when the Twin Acendents Oppon apear to Captian parran"
1,I do not care about the characters,"I read about fifty pages , and I was very disappointed. I just finished the game of thrones series, and I was looking for something to read next, but this fell far short of my hopes. The characters were disengaging and the writing is immature and stiff. I cant stand to read any more."
2,Not Worth It,"My God, this book is a chore to get through. I made it through the first 3 books of this series so I feel I've come far enough to offer a warning to those considering this series. This is not George R.R. Martin. Not even close. I understand that this is the 1st of a 10 book series but the narrative is nearly incomprehensible. It will start to make a bit more sense about halfway through the 2nd book but unless you are really into characters who stand around ""grimacing"" and pondering the word ""efficacious,"" give this one a pass. And the names! Whiskeyjack? Seriously? Yes, Annomander Rake is a great name, I admit it. I also admit this review is probably not at all helpful... I just needed to get it out of my system."
1,Incredibly confusing,I am not a fan of this book what so ever. And if the rest of the series is anything like the first book I wil not even bother reading a sample.This book so so confusing in the beginning you have no idea what is happening until about half way through and the Author doesn't even bother going into details about where these events take place. I wish he had used at least a little imagery instead of focusing on just the people and events.Also Erickson introduces so many characters through out the book that you easily get confused and loose track as to were the general plot is taking you.
2,"Hey buddy, can you spare a protagonist?","I've finished book one (the first 123 pages)and I just can't go on. This book suffers from having too many characters, introduced too quickly- virtually all without description. The protagonist (Paran?) gets lost in a world of complex magics and places. The author takes little time to establish who the story is about and, more importantly, why we should care. There is certainly a great deal of invention and detail here. Impressive in fact. On reflection: I'd like to see the book edited further. I'd like to see just a single character- Tattersail or Hairlock perhaps- plucked out of the book and have a good tail spun around them.I'm going to put this epic away on the bookshelf now. I hope I havn't detered anyone from purchasing it."
2,Do Not Enter,"I rarely spend the time reviewing books because by the time I get around to reading something almost every intelligent point has already been covered elsewhere. With regards to this series though, I feel obliged to chime in with a rating (and thus also a few words) as I am truly puzzled as to how this series is rated so highly (it makes sense as you move along the series as most of the 'haters' will have abandoned ship by then).The author tries so hard to create an 'epic tale', carrying on with at least a half dozen story lines, but in the end the book just feels empty and lost. Truly remarkable for books that are hundreds upon hundreds of pages. There are some other issues as well such as absurd plot devices; someone really enjoys their deus ex machina. It's not all bad so I won't give it one star, but if you are going to invest hundreds of hours of your life into something - it better be reallly good and this just isn't. Save yourself the time and look elsewhere."
1,Gardens of the Moon,This book was a big disappointment. The author has excellent technical writing skills which I feel were wasted on a plot which was trite at best and incoherent at worst. The characters were predictable and shallow - by the end of the book I was so bored and annoyed I didn't care if any of them lived or died.
1,Ho Hum,"I read and read and read, waiting for something to happen and nothing did. Finally I gave up and didn't finish the book. It's totally awash in blood, meaningless wars, characters who have dull conversations. Nothing takes place in an exciting or interesting way. It's kind of like a grown-up Dick and Jane book. Oh, oh, look, look. See the blood, see the war, see the walls falling down, see the mages, see the blue-tinged skin on the lady. Everything is told instead of showing with descriptive words and phrases.I'm a big fantasy fan and I love good fantasy. This is not good fantasy. It's a plodding experience.As far as I'm concerned the book is a waste of time and money."
2,What's Missing?,"I have read several of the other reviews that tell new readers that they will begin to pick up an understanding of the Malazan world as they go through volumes 2 and 3. I don't remember ever having to do such a thing with any other writer. George RR Martin is clear, JRR Tolkien is too. What frustrates me, I think, is that Erikson makes leaps between the facts he does choose to give his readers. The reader has to stop to figure out what info has been left out, and then reread because there isn't enough data to fill in the gaps. By the time I was a third the way through Gardens, I had bare sketches of a large world that was mostly blank. Frustrating. Also, I would say that his phrasing is often awkward and convaluted, thus making the reader go back and reread for a second reason.I would basically say that he's not worth the price of a used version. Harsh, I know, but my money is valuable to me!"
2,Trouble finishing....but I will make it,"I am 30 pages from finishing and feel the book was not worth my time. I liked some of the characters but the lack of development in most of them left me not caring what happened to them. I feel like I am plodding through a book I have to read more than one I want to read. very much like the later books of Robert Jordan. I read a lot of fantasy/sci fi I am afraid to put too much time into something that can turn into the ""waste of time""....sorry I meant the ""wheel of time"" by Jordan ."
3,too much information to digest,I have to admit i did enjoy this book and this could be a great set to get into.However... i found that there was far too much information to digest and i found myself just reading in the moment rather than apply what i was reading to other parts of the story.I will try the second book but not until i have tried another set like the farseer trilogy
5,Terrific Start to a Series,"Gardens of the Moon is like few fantasy books you'll ever read. The author drops you into a world at the beginning, without any explanation, and lets you slowly absorb the personalities and locals he has created. Since this is the first of a 10 volume series, Erickson is in no hurry to push the push the plot along, but by the end, you can't wait for the sequel. As in any really good book, the author uses seemingly unimportant acts to have important consequences later in the novel. The world that Erickson has created can be dark and gritty. The characters can be either good or bad, but sometimes making a value judgement is not easy. All in all, a really good piece of fantasy writing."
4,Memories of Ice: Malazan Empire 3,"Afficionados of this series have already figured out that the quick way to get ahold of the new one is to go over to Amazon.co.uk and pre-order them there. The third book in the series, ""Memories of Ice"", is now available for pre-order, and due to be published in Oct. 2001. Good news for fans of book #1 who (like me) were frustrated by #2 (Deadhouse Gates) only following the storyline of some of the characters -- #3 sounds like it will take us back to the main Bridgeburner brigade. No wonder Erikson is going to take 10 books to deal with this series, if he plans on spawning multiple storylines and devoting a book to each thread!"
5,Real power fantasy book,"Everyone, who just want to experience the rush of adrenaline by reading fantasy books have to read this book! This is the BEST high fantasy book i'v ever read(i'v read em alot) and i cannot wait for sequel. Erikson has a different approach to the whole thing. He jumps right into action...at first its hard to get into it, but once you are there, you cant get enough of it! A MUST READ BOOK for power fantasy ppl!Try also Richard.A.Knaak to those, who enjoyed this book."
4,Waiting for book 2 / Good start,"I enjoyed it. Good action, good pace, a good amount of magic.I like an author how is willing to add magic, dragons, magic swords, and strong monsters, demons, etc.. and keep it realistic.I am now waiting for book 2!"
3,Good but not great,It was a well written book Erikson only gets better as an author as you progress through this series. Granted I'm only on book 3 of the series but the 2nd book was better and the 3rd is shaping up to be better then the 2nd.
4,"Great story, I really enjoyed this book","A friend brought this book to my attention. I am a reader that gets bored very quickly, so a good story, with the right amount of character development is a must for me. It was hard for me to set this book down. I thought the story was wonderful (yes... I know it is about war, but oh well). To me, the character development may have been a little week, but it didn't take away from the book at all. I am ready to read the next book in this series, I hope it is as good as this one.."
1,Give me my money back,"I've read 25% book as of now, still don't know what its about !! First 60 pages I read twice and still could not figure out what is important and who to focus on. he goes on and keep adding people which i cant even keep track of.I have seen kids write better short stories.DO NOT BUY !!"
1,Couldn't finish this book,"I'm an avid reader who likes the fantasy Genre. This is a complicated work thats lacks the ""fun"" of a good work of fiction. I finished the entire 5 volumes of Game of thrones in under a month and I couldn't get through 100 pages of this book in two weeks. Life is short- stick to Martin and Rothfus."
2,help,"I didn't recive the book, and I don't know why, but I can't file a claim. please help me. how should I proceed?"
2,grinning...,"If you took out the words grin, grinned, and grining, this book would be about half as thick as it is."
2,Deal me out of this series,"A few minor passages in the book describe characters whiling away their time by playing a card game with a divination deck, wherein one player changes the rules on the fly to benefit his hand, and the other player just goes along with it, not caring much about where the game is leading. Oddly enough, this scenario captures the essence of my reading experience; the author making up rules on the fly, and me just passing the time as one vaguely meaningful image appears after another."
1,"Too much, too soon","Gave up when major characters were still being introduced around page 200. After a promising beginning focusing on Paran, Erikson starts jumping all over the place. It's hard to follow the plot, and even harder to care about the never-ending stream of characters that keep arriving on centre stage. It's a shame, because Erikson does a very good job in spots. A good editor would've made a world of difference. As it is, though, the book is all but unreadable."
2,Meh,I didn't even finish it. Got about halfway through after a friend recommended this to me since I loved A Song of Ice and Fire. No fantasy I've read comes anywhere close to GRRM. He has pretty much ruined the whole genre for me since I read the first 3 books of his series. I wish he could have wrapped up the whole thing in the 3rd volume rather than subject us to the crap that is A Feast for Crows and A Dance with Dragons.
3,A good read!,This book had lots of plots and subplots. There is lots of action in this one from start to finish. I would have given it 4 stars if not for the same things mention in the first review. I hate when authors kill characters and then magically bring them back.
3,Glutton for punishment . . . I'm buying book 2,"This series was #2 on a list of best epic fantasy ([...]). Agreeing with the rest of the list I thought it must be a winner. After finishing the book last night I still have a headache. Was it the word jumble of names and places that kept me from recognizing references? Maybe it was how I felt (or really didn't feel) about most of the characters. So many names/races/gods that I couldn't remember who, what or why they were in the story to begin with.Still I'm buying book two. Because when I was 20% into the book (yes it was so tedious I was tracking progress on the Kindle) the plot came together. Because I do want to know what happens to the girl. Because the complexity of the land and people pulled me in. Anyway, it's a way to put off studying for a managerial accounting class. So we'll see. I'll invest $6 and let you know."
1,What the fiction is this?,"I tried, and unfortunately I fell int that group of people that could not follow ALL of the different view points and changes and what is the point of this story, really - I followed book one just fine, but once into book two, it was like starting over and I felt let down that I invested time into a book and found by that point a new book - and a totally different angle on EVERYTHING - yeah, so I quit - so sue me - i just can not deal with a book that has more person point-of-views than there are days in the week - sorry - too much jumping around - next time, it should be separate novels in the same world, not multiple novels within one binding."
3,Wow...meh,"Have you ever watched a movie and felt like there had to have been a prequel that you missed that would explain a lot? That's what best describes this book.This book has some really good moments, almost bordering on great, but the first few hundred pages are just so incoherent and insubstantial (and there is a big need for substance and explanation) and well, baffling that you have to really be devoted to finishing books to attempt this."
3,I couldnt finish it,"I was really looking forward to trying more fantasy books after falling in love with the game of thrones series. This one was recommended on what should I read next site.Reviews said it takes a while to get started so I tried really hard but I just didnt connect with any of the characters. I found the references to mages, wizards, and other forms of fantasy characters to be just too much for me. I liked that little bit of fantasy thrown into the game of thrones but this was just to bizarre for my taste. I am sure a true fantasy lover might think differently but just not my style."
2,Not what I'd been told to expect.,"I read several reviews that stated this was an incredible and creative fantasy series. So, in an effort to find new and exciting vistas for my imagination to play in, I got this book and started reading. After two weeks of struggling to get into the book, and finding no avenue by which I could gain entrance to Erikson's horrible world, I gave up (about page 250). This book is so disjointed, so poorly articulated, so lacking in characters one can identify with that it left me wishing I could forget all that I'd absorbed up till the time that I stopped reading. The first 100 pages are just leaps through time among pathetic scenes of morbidity. I hear the second book in this series is the better one, but I'll never give Erikson the chance to take me that far. A very disappointing book. Where is all the good fantasy these days?"
1,No one wants to read a transcript of someone's amateurish Dungeons & Dragons adventure,"I have discovered a new level of writing beneath the pulp of Goodkind and Jordan, and it is The Malazan Book of the Fallen. A few pages in, this book struck me as a gussied-up transcript of a some kid's Dungeons & Dragons adventure. Sadly, a quick wikipedia search confirmed this (well, it was the GURPS RPG system, but close enough).There is absolutely no character development, no interesting themes, not even a spark of dramatic tension. As one might expect from its origins, the story contains a hodgepodge of names and settings with little underlying consistency. The book masks its lack of depth with needless complexity. I don't mind complex storylines, but the lack of payoff left me feeling robbed of my time.I'm sure Mr. Erikson runs a fine game of Dungeons & Dragons. I just don't want to read about it."
2,Book of the Fallen Falls,"Too many plot lines presented too early in the book. There are so many characters doing so much magic stuff that I made it two-thirds through the book without caring about any of them.Unlike Song of Ice and Fire, Wheel of Time, Dark Tower or Long Price, Malazan book one was just a chore to read."
3,Tedious for my tastes,"This book, may have been a hit for many, But truthfully I found it tedious and unpleasant to read.I cant quite put my finger on exactly what it was that caused me to feel this way, It felt like it was slow to get to theheart of what it was truly about.The whole descriptive narrative was great, your really got a sense of doom and gloom, but something was just generally unpleasant about reading it/."
3,"Good book; quite good, but not amazing","This is the first book in a fantasy series that has garnered some very high praise. It is probably most comparable to the Black Company series by Glen Cook, although not quite as well done. The characters are well developed, the history presented has some depth and unique complexity, the plot is not simple and it is not crudely derivative of Tolkien as so many lesser works are. It is not, however, in the same league of literature as Tolkien or a modern classic such as R. Scott Bakker's Second Apocalypse series (The Prince of Nothing, etc). I would guess that anyone who likes serious fantasy literature would certainly enjoy this book and the rest of the series, and perhaps even love them."
3,Good bedtime reading,"This book is great bedtime reading: the plot is interesting enough to kind of want to know what happens, but not interesting enough to keep you up until 2 AM to find out. The many story lines and plethora of characters are a little hard to keep track of, especially with soul-hopping sorcerers, and after a while I stopped caring; it would have needed a diagram to keep it all straight. Enjoyable, not fantastic."
3,What the????,"Many people put Erikson up there with Martin and Jordan. I just couldn't get into this book. I was confused from page one and my confusion simply continued. New characters were tossed out seemingly on every page, and after 100 pages, I gave up. Maybe I'll try again later because the writing, imagination, and what I could make of the characters was very interesting. He does give his characters some pretty stupid names, though."
2,A very disappointing book,"I purchased this book based on all of the positive reviews here, and after having completed it, I am baffled as to the praise this book as gathered.I kept feeling like I was reading the 2nd book in a series, as the author skips any attempt at a back story of the characters, the land, the wars, the gods - everything. The book reads like a bunch of scattered ideas all thrown together - loosely. It's hard to decide what to even consider the major plot points, but whichever you choose you will find they don't resolve to any satisfaction.I wanted to like this book, but I just couldn't."
3,The who did what where?,"Reading a review of this book called it ""sprawling"". Sprawling is too specific. This book wanders though not always aimlessly. Erikson is a very good writer but not the best story teller and in a genre that rewards both he is really only halfway there. The issue with most fantasy novels is trying to set down whatever respective lore the story takes place in. I have seen many different approaches ranging from over explaining to just leaving it out all together. Erikson errs on the side of the latter of the two. I constantly found myself trying to figure out what if anything I had missed when he casually drops a new piece of lore with no explanation. He does usually explain the relevance somewhere much later which is no good to the reader at that time. I imagine with more patience and the willingness to re-read this again it would be a fine book. Until he starts putting in a compendium Gardens will be the last book I read in this series."
5,A Breath of Fresh Air,"Being a fan of good, intelligent fantasy means you have to sift through many authors and books before finding one you like and can get wrapped up in (i.e. George R.R. Martin). The Malazan books are excellent for Martin fans as it brings in unique characters that play the hero role but have their own faults, gods are not allpowerful and can fall, and complex plots that are original. It is hard to call anyone in the books actual heroes, they are ordinary characters set in extraordinary circumstances. If you are in the military you will appreciate the battles and references, however anyone can follow it. The battles are complex but not so much that they become hard to follow. It scratches the hard to reach spot where fantasy is the backdrop to a GOOD story. Without the fantasy the story would still be good. All in all it is a great read."
3,dazed and confused,"I was lost after the first 100 pages but interested. After 600 pages I was just as lost and confused but wanted to get the next book. There are so many players, gods, demigods, elders, societies, cultures etc without explanation or a map as to how they fit together...the characters are in the know but only give you glimpses. I will continue to read if only to get a handle on this world."
1,misleading offer,this was an offer for the movie it was a interview with an actor 10 minutes was offered as a free movie disappointed
1,Don't,"It's so bad it makes you like the first movie, less.Terrible acting.It's like they weren't even trying to make a good movie.Watch Memento, instead. Or the first movie twice."
1,UGH,"This is the worst movie I have ever seen. Boondock saints 1 was, as well all know excellent. This movie is so remarkably bad I feel so ripped off for buying it. I wish I had the time to visit Flanery to get my money back or punch him in the face for ruining what could have been great. The choice could be his. DO NOT RENT OR BUY!!"
1,A 10 MINUTE TRAILER,BEWARE! This is just a crappy 10 minute piece. Don't be fooled. The movie was great but this is just...
5,Must see,"This movie was great! They play well with others. I love the prayer they say just before they cut somebody down. Cleaning up the trash off the steets. i don't support vigil antes, but they make it look fun!"
1,Correction,"I believe you have posted incorrect product label information descibing this item. The newer BWR102 model comes with the wireless remote monitor, memory functions and BMI history features. The BWR101 is a standard floor model without the wireless wall mount monitor display. It also retails for a obout 1/2 the price! Please note that I did not intend to rate this item because I never used it."
5,DOPE!,"Pure Hip Hop without all the BS! Not one time on this CD does he mention ""ice"" or ""bling-bling"" which is so refreshing. This kid will go far in the rap game...."
2,Deceiving Chocker Picture,"The chocker appears to be absolutely beautiful in the picture, but when it arrived it was very cheap looking. There was glue all around the jewel. I realize that the price is great but not the quality. I would not recommend this to anyone because I really believe they would be disappointed."
5,Excellent Western!,"Set in 1875, Apache Territory.This is a very good story.The main character is a soldier Cavalry scout, leader of eight Indian scouts.You get mule team wagon hauling.A little cliff dwelling archaeology.Fist fights. A taste of romance. Murder and vengeance.The title ""Apache Tears"" refers to an obsidian necklace worn by our scout's love interest.MacLeod has a gift for making you feel in the times and setting of unsettled Arizona.I am looking for more of his westerns."
5,"OH, wow!!!","This book is an amazing mystery, that will quench any reader's thirst for a scare!!!!!It is twisted with comedy, & suspence!!!!!I finished it in 1 day it was so good!!!!!!"
5,"Mystery, Cliffhangers, Adventure and Daring","This is a good book if your looking for some serious mystery and cliffhangers. It's about a girl named Gilda Joyce who has a part-time job as a Psychic Investigator at the age of 13. She explores a mysterious haunted mansion with her cousin and they find themselves in a situation that includes a mysterious death in the tower. I read this book in one day, because I did not want to put it down!!!!It's a must read!"
2,Dissappointed,"If you have read about the Civil War in depth you will find this book maddening. The stories lurch between naming the regiments in a battle line to skipping over large portions of each battle. There seems to be no rhyme or reason in the approach to the information. I suppose I expected a battlefield book that would give me a topographical feel for the battle where in reality the bulk of the book is a synopsis of larger events and in some cases the battles themselves.Another problem I had with the book is the general point of view that the Yankees were a bunch of bumbling drunkards who by happenstance were successful and the Confederates, especially Lee, were brilliant, noble leaders who at critical moments the fates intervened to ruin their otherwise perfect battle plans. I literally had to reread the last page of the Gettysburg chapter four times to finally come to the conclusion that the author states the Lee won the battle!"
5,The reference book,This book is a must have for any serious civil war buff. It contains very accurate references to all the battles fought during this turning point in American History. Highly recommended.
2,A Disappointment,"The author may be a wonderful battlefield tour guide, but he is no writer, and his recounting of these key Civil War battles leaves much to be desired. Mr. Bearss is so obsessed with minutiae that he often loses the thread of his narrative. He lets himself become distracted by unimportant asides, and the book itself is a patched-together version of M. Bearss' battlefield lectures interspersed with other material that attempts to tie it all together. The maps are not especially helpful, and in the Kindle edition almost unreadable, even with a magnifying glass. The book may appeal to Civil War aficionados, but it will not appeal to the general reader."
5,great product,"Great product, fast delivery, this book will be given to a friend, who will enjoy learning move on the civil war, and discovering new things about it"
3,A good book with some flaws,"Bearss obviously knows his material, and for those familiar with the Civil War his almost endless recitations of every brigade commander involved in every battle may be useful, but for someone trying to get a grasp on events, the endless recitations seriously bogs down the narrative. The book also suffers from weak writing. A good book, it just could have been so much better."
3,Great Stories; Bad Maps,"Accounts of each battle were clear, as were reasons for each outcome. On Kindle, the maps were basically useless, since the print was so small and faint. I bought a large magnifying glass, to no avail. This would have been a much more enlightening experience had the maps been readable.Fields of Honor"
5,Great Ruffian Book to Purchase,"This book has more pictures in it for the Ruffian fan. It is not as comprehensive as others about Ruffian, but does contain the pictures that the other books lack. You will enjoy this small, but packed with information volume about Ruffian. It is a must for any Ruffian lover, or collector."
2,Absolute drivel!,"I took a chance when I bought this book as I had never read any of Ms. Staub's books before. Well, you win some...you lose some. In this case, I lost some (money). Take my advice and don't waste your time or money on this book. The princess of a fictitious country loses her virginity to the handsome American playboy, gets pregnant, and runs off with him on the day of her wedding to the handsome prince of another fictitious country. The unlikely couple must then try to exist in the US without the silver spoons they were born with. This highly improbable plot is not rescued by the two main characters, who are shallow and unmemorable. Would someone like to have my copy?"
5,Fairy tail??,"Princess Emmaline of Verunia is engaged to Prince Remi of the neighboring country of Buiron when she meets Granger Lockwood IV (a wealthy New York entrepreneur).Several months later as the royal wedding is getting closer Emmaline starts getting sick in the morning and faints during a dress measurement. When she figures out that she is pregnant she calls Granger and asked him to help her escape Verunia.They escape and spend the next couple of months learning to live like normal people (Granger quite his job working for his grandfather and had to move out of the spacious apartment he had been living in)As the two navigate the real world they learn a lot about themselves that they did not before, and with the help of one of Granger's friends they find themselves in love.A very good book"
1,Silver Tongues,I want my five bucks back.----Be detailed and specific. What would you have wanted to know before you purchased the product? Not too short and not too long. Aim for between 75 and 300 words.
4,Does what it Does,"I have no way to tell if the device is accurate, but it seems to be consistent, and that is what is important.The device is easy to use and setup, except they should make a bigger point that user 'Zero' does not get their settings saved. That may be why some users were having usability issues."
2,Dumb toy...the balls are fun!,I got this toy for my 9 month old baby. He likes the music and balls and thats it. It hasn't been much fun for him. He chooses to play with his other toys instead of this one. If you are to buy it get it for a 2 year old. I am serious my two year old loves putting the balls in and hearing the music.
1,"Short life, poor quality","I wouldn't recommend any of Oregon Scientific products. The Weather Station I bought had to be returned within a month because of multiple failures. The replacement lasted about six months.Oregon Scientific is noted for good looking products that have horrible quality control. Look elsewhere, I see some storm chaser teams rely on Davis Instruments equipment. I'm going to look into their products next."
5,Better than the TV weather forcasts!,"I had always wanted a complete weather station, but didn't want to drill holes and run wires all over the house. When I saw the Oregon Scientific Cable-Free Weather Station I was THRILLED. And I continue to be extremely happy with my decision to buy! The initial set-up was very easy - the step by step instructions were very clear. You do have to take the time to set each unit correctly to get accurate measurements, but it is well worth the time. The forecasts have been 100% accurate! ( am a landscaper and I need this accuracy to plan my workday.) Having a weather staion is also a lot of fun. My children run to the main display unit after a heavy gust of wind - to see how fast the wind was blowing! I would recommend this weather station to ANYONE who has any interest in the weather. The TV weather guys should get one - it would certainly improve their forecasts!!"
1,Under The Weather,"Had this product for two years. Its charger port broke about four months ago. Asked Oregon if it could be repaired. Their answer was ""No"", buy a new one as it's out of the one year warranty. Batteries will only last about a week so I jury- rigged the power supply.Now the barometer stopped working and will not predict weather. Buy something else."
5,Great Rebel Ship,"I got this and it is very good.I love it.It's easy to build but you have to pay close attention to the instructions.It's easy to move the wings to X formation or on top of each other.Also you get rare minifigures and lots of them.Also you can customize the X Wing fighter to Wedge Antilless or Luke Skywalker and you get both of them as pilots.The other minifigures are R2 D2,Chewbacca,Han Solo,and Princess Leia Organa.It is really fun and does not take much time to build and is also very sturdy.I highly recommend this Lego set."
5,Learning is fun,Star Wars is SciFi at its best. Not only creativity for thinking about outer space but also an adventure in problem-solving a hands-on experience is this toy. Have fun.
5,"Given as a gift, totally great response","We gave this as a gift recently at a birthday party for an 8 year old and I could not believe the response. Loud scream and almost didn't want to open other presents. When we visited later, we got to see the results and got told all about it. Not sure if it's the Legos or the Star Wars, but a winner either way."
2,Frustration,"We bought the x-wing for my 8-year old. He put it together easily enough. He enjoyed how it looked and playing with it. He doesn't play with his toys rough but the movable wings and jets kept falling off and its frustrating for him and me to keep putting them back on. So if you want to build this thing for looks fine, but if your child hopes to play with it that may be another story. It has been a good tool for teaching him about lego reengineering and not trusting instructions. But at what these guys charge for a few plastic pieces -- they should put more thought into their design. Funny, legos made their reputation on these things but I found my kid's megablocks probuild set holds together much better. I wouldn't get x-wing again, but if you must the price was $59.99 at toys r us. Got to go, have to rebuild those wings! Break out the glue gun."
2,Poor Design (for LEGO),"Got this set for my sons (ages 7 and 5) for Christmas. They are huge LEGO Star Wars fans and we have a number of sets already. We just finished building it and on this one, I mean 'we'. Although they can build most LEGO sets by themselves, this one I had to help out. Not because it's really that difficult to build, but because it simply just does NOT hold together.The wings and the thrusters are only connected with a few 'dots' and so they are constantly breaking off and apart. The set looks really cool and is probably going to be a hit with any Star Wars fan, but if you want a set to do more than just have as a model, I would recommend another set. (The Anakin Y-wing fighter has worked pretty well for my son).We now face the options of having this set sit on the shelf as a model (not going to happen), or be constantly brought to me for repair (sigh), or end up being broken apart and added to the bin of miscellaneous part. Probably the latter."
3,Grandma's opinion,I purchased two x-wing fighters one each for my 10 yr. old and 8 yr. old grandsons. Both were thrilled. I watched the 8-yr old put it together (glad it was him putting it together and NOT me). He was almost finished when he said there was a part missing. What he needed were mirror image pieces and what he had was two of the same. He was rather upset but then said he could go on without it and probably would have a piece he could substitute at home. For what these Legos cost all the correct pieces should be included!
5,Lock S-foils in attack position!,"This is the best set that LEGO ever made!!!This X-wing is pretty big, plus you get Luke, Wedge, R2-D2, Han, Chewbacca, and Leia! A great deal! And this thing is very durable!The landing gear makes it stand by itself! And Luke also comes witha blue lightsaber!! A great set to add to any LEGO/Star Wars collection!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Buyer beware!!,"Great set but don't be ripped off! This is one of the so called ""hard to find"" sets, which only means you can only buy them direct from Lego stores or website, or from Toys 'r' Us. This is a fifty dollar set, don't pay twice the price here!"
5,Star Wars LEGO,"Purchased for my 7 year old son, who loves Star Wars and LEGOs. This is going to be his main Christmas gift. The actual X-Wing will be nice, but I'm sure he will get bored after a while. Thus the brilliance of LEGOs...he then will spend hours designing something new with the parts."
3,This one falls apart,Mini figs are good. Falls apart too easily. Frustrating to have to keep rebuilding. Nice to look at but not for play.
2,Frustrated,My 8 year old loves lego and we have about 50 different sets. This is one of the most frustrating. The wings and the blasters keep coming off! Someone at Lego should have tested this one out. Surely it could have been more durable. I'm tired of trying to fix it for him! I'm very sorry that we made this purchase.
2,Was missing the main four wing sections!,"Hard to wake up Christmas morning and not be able to put together the ""most exciting gift"" that was on my son's list! I did call and Lego is sending out the missing parts, just have to learn the virtue of patience as it takes 7-10 days."
5,Another great lego kit,I got this kit as a present for my husband. He had a great time putting this together and it is now displayed. The directions were clear and concise and the kit went together fast. The little lego characters add a wonderful touch to the model.
5,It's the best!,"I'm posting my 7 year old's review:Very playable and I can change the wing style into a X-wing. R2 is my favorite and it's included. The Lego guys are Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, Han and Chewbacca. You can store Luke's light saber at the bottom of the ship. The ship looks cool. The wings are a little completed to build but fun to build. I would recommend to others."
4,Legos are awesome,"nice model, fun to put together... blasters fall off relatively easy if played with but overall great model"
1,Rip-off,"Available direct from the Lego online store for $[...]. These sellers are rip-off artists.Fantastic set, though. Great improvement on the original X-Wing, nice minifig collection too."
4,Good intro to Jay Abraham,"If you are looking for innovative and valuable marketing ideas, the kind you will not learn in Business School, then look no further.Jay Abraham has taken classic direct marketing methodologies, amped them up on steroids and added his own unique twists.This is an older book, and although a good overview, a far more comprehensive review of Jays methods can be found in ""Getting Everything You Can Out of All You've Got.""A good although brief read. If you are a Jay Abraham junkie you can never have too much Jay, and you can add this to your collection for completeness sake."
5,Absolutely fantastic jazz flute: don't miss it!,"If you check out only one new artist this year, make it Jan Leder. By sheer luck, I learned about this CD from the artist herself via N2K's Jazz Central Station website. Boy am I glad I did! The demise of the label that produced Passage to Freedom has left it largely unavailable in stores. But don't let that deter you. The extra effort you'll need to make to purchase a copy will be well worth it. If you're not sure you like the sound of the flute in jazz, this CD will almost certainly convince you; if you already enjoy jazz flute, you will LOVE this CD. And not only is the flutist talented, so are all the accompanists. I especially enjoy the playing of pianist Jon Davis. In short, Jan Leder is my best artist discovery all year and Passage to Freedom is one of my best CD purchases ever"
3,Simple Phone Number Searching,"Good for quick simple Searching, Online Database better for new and updated information."
2,This is a 1997 Phone Directory,"If you want a list of 1997 phone numbers, this is it. Works fine for looking up where people lived and what their phone number was then. It is too bad that you cannot buy a 2012 version of this at a reasonable price. I found a company that sells the 2012 version for $599.00. The only other way that I have found to get similar information is from the scam artists on the internet. There is a big opportunity here for some company that would offer this information at a reasonable price."
3,Pretty Good,"Actually, this product did what I had hoped: it kicked me up to the next level of exercising. I just wish it had been easier to program. (I ended up having to ask a work colleague for help.) But it does work particularly well when I jog, less well when I cycle. Still think it is good value for the price.js in sd"
1,Oregon Scientifc Customer Service sucks,"Wrote to them several times, without receiving a response. Called and got rude responses. Will never buy from this company again!"
1,Worst Instructions/manual ever candidate,"Possibly a very good product however you will never be able to tell - The instructions are ridiculouly brief and don't cover half the symbols that appear on the screen. End result, you have no idea how to operate it. I have email Oregon Scientific repeatidly (as I see, have a number of other unhappy amazon reviewers) and never had any response. This company does not deserve your business."
2,so so,"i must say, i'm a pretty technically savy person but this product confuses me. The instructions that came with it do nothing to explain how to use it and I find myself only using the strap for my chest because that miraculously links up to my cross-trainer! I would not recommend this product."
1,Problems with HR308 and water,This WHRM was supposed to work upto 300 ft. I use it for the very first time in a pool 3 ft. depth and it just got mad.The water in the screen does not allow to watch numbers.If you plan to splash your WHRM better choose another one.
3,um......what about shorter or lighter people?,"I ordered this particular monitor because it was advertised as one that fit, and worked for, women. Well.....not women who are below 5'7"" and 143.....which is probably a lot of us. This means that I can only use the monitor for measuring heart-rate, not for training......That makes this a seriously overpriced choice for people who are less than 5""7""......"
3,"Good, but there are cheaper ways to do this.",This works great. I actually have no problems with this heart rate monitor. I just used a friends heart rate monitor and it worked just as good for 1/3 the price.
3,A good in-between books read.,"I picked up this book to read in-between a couple of series I have been reading, and I enjoyed it. It is a fast and easy read, If you are just starting to read Christian fiction, or end times books then I would recommend this one to get you started. The characters are interesting, although not much depth to the story lines, Makes a great lazy afternoon book."
5,much neaded book,if you have a teacher like mine that doesnt teach and expects you to learn through the book this book is very much neaded
1,Didn't receive package...,I didn't receive the package of the Chemistry Lab Handbook I ordered in the mail from you. It has been over a month since I have needed it. I would really appreciate knowing what could have happened and if I can get my money back or if is going to be shipped to me as soon as possible.
4,Good Watch,"This is probably the 5th or 6th Seiko watch I have owned. Seiko makes a very good product, and I wouldn't keep buying them if I wasn't satisfied. My only complaint (if you can call it that) is the band. These type of fold-over, clasp type bands are hard to re-size, and they are unforgiving while on your wrist. I had a Seiko years ago that had a band that was very easy to adjust, as the clasp assembly easily slid up and down the metal band. The clasp had a clamp on it that allowed for easy movement and adjustment. If the watch felt too tight, a quick adjustment, and everything was fine. Aparently Seiko doesn't make this type of watch band anymore, because I've searched and searched and haven't been able to find a watch with this type of band."
4,"""Firme"" sounds from the Fifth Sun","I've heard ""aver aver"" and ""WestCoast Love"", these two tracks are an interesting combination of urban sounds with a latin twist. It's been a long time since I have even heard anything close to these guys. I was just listening to one of their newer tracks on their website www.447ltd.com ,these guys know how to mix it up, my advice is go out and buy this single and look for the Fifth Sun to blow up big time."
2,Another Bad One,"I bought this about two years ago, but only for a travel printer. It started getting daily use about a year ago when my wife started using it.No problem with print quality, but it's now unusable as it continually paper jams due to the rollers pulling the paper thru at an odd angle. The troubleshooting fixes in the manual didn't fix it. It's now junk. I have never gotten such poor usage out of a printer. Also own an i950 and I can't say I'm particularly happy with that printer....uses a ton of color ink, even when set at grayscale. Now why would it use color ink when it's set for b/w only? Go figure."
1,"""Canon"" Best Printers","I just love my canon printer. The print quality is great and the inks are inexpensive. As a matter of fact I have bought four canon printers (i250,i350) and today I am going to buy another one for my sister. Canon keep up the good work. I have to add that I hate Epson and all the other brands in the market because the inks are just too expensive."
1,Don't Buy Canon,"Canon will not stand behind their products. If one breaks you'll get sent from place to place to place and they may even offer you a replacment but rest assured it won't be in your favor. We dealt with them trying to get another printer replaced after it broke several times. Their response was to exchange it for a unit costing half as much and when we objected they were beyond rude. Go with HP, they actually care about their customers."
5,Fantastic Printer at Great price,"We have been SO happy with this printer after our Lexmark Z42 just got to be too expensive. A new Canon printer and cartridges was less than replacing the color and b/w tanks in the lexmark. Also, the heads only are replaced when needed, reducing cost and waste. that makes the heads around $35 (when needed) and the ink tanks around $5. Buy one now!"
3,Cheap refills...til you need a print head.,"We liked this printer for it's good quality printing, and cheap ink tanks, but on the second color cartridge the magenta nozzles clogged, and I've pretty much burned all the ink in the brand new cartidges trying to get it to work. Now I wish the cartridge came with a new print head like my old worn out lexmark...Going through Canon's interactve ""troubleshooting"", it seems like they don't believe the print head can fail. I've done a lot of searching tonight, and I can't seem to find replacement print heads sold anywhere...I can't recommend this printer."
3,a step backwards,"I've had canon bubble jets for years, starting all the way back with the BJC 200. The brand name, the reviews, and especially the vertical sheet feed is what does it for me over the HPs, works great when printing partial sheets of checks. However, the Canon's don't tend to last that long - I think this is my 4th one in the last 10 years. When my last one stopped working (a 2110), I got the i350.The good news is, the setup is a complete breeze, and it seems faster than the 2110. However, this is outweighed by the bad news.First, it no longer uses a printer cable, it's only USB. This is nice for forwards compatibility and all, but those things are $$$.Second, and more importantly, the thing is LOUD. It has a ""Quiet mode"" which makes it marginally quieter when printing, but it does a pre-print ""warmup"" and post-print ""cooldown"" which are both annoyingly loud, they make me jump.So, in sum, if the noise doesn't bother you, go for it, otherwise I'd recommend you look elsewhere."
2,Print heads fail,"I have both the i250 and the i350. The i250 print head failed after 3 months of use (blank lines in the middle of words), but was still under warranty, so I managed to persuade Canon to send me a new print head. BTW, the print head costs about $45 to $50... almost the same as cost of the printer. Next, I upgraded to the i350. This time, the print head took 8 months to fail...same problem. I regard these as disposable printers, nothing more. They work great until the print heads fail."
1,Very Confusing,"The title of this book compelled me to try it as it sounded fascinating. However, I found it to be very difficult to understand for the average reader. Dewdney frequently introduces terms that he assumes the average person will understand. In most cases that is true, however there are a few times when it isn't. Furthermore, rather than relying on simple examples or other illustrations, he uses very difficult and elaborate examples. His writing clearly shows that he is a scientist and writing for an audience who has a significant background in science. I tried reading each of the 8 problems and came to the same conclusion. Writers like Bryson or even Hawking are much better at taking complex science and math and making them understandable to the layperson."
4,good first train set,"Its a good starter set. Save a lot of money over buying pieces seperatly. I wish it had a working smoke stack. Also, i dont know if its just the one i got or all the motors they put in this locomotive, but at very slow speed you can hear a fairly loud buzzing sound coming from the motor. Going to contact Bachmann to see if this is normal."
4,A new look at john Dewey is necessary:,"Any library with John Dewey on the stacks should consider this contemporary introspection into this Philosopher, Educator and aesthetition of incredible prolifity. A post-modern generation is precisely the audience addressed here, and would be frustrated by earlier works seeking to offer guiding light to the unique creative mind of John Dewey, who is no easy read. Though this collection is highly academic, I doubt anyone would go there without such an inclination to begin with."
2,The Market Makers misses the mark,"The author demonstrates his capability to explain basic concepts of economics and marketing, but certainly doesn't define a revolutionary new approach to business as alluded to on the inside front cover flap. We are introduced to new buzz words such as 'spatial abitage' although any reader looking for insight is bound has to be disappointed in the explanations and lack of substance. In addition, most charts and tables in the book must be filler because they appear childish. The only redeeming chapters are at the end when the author disusses various market strategies, but for a better and more complete discussion, dust off an old copy of 'Marketing Warfare."""
4,Great Value,"This is by no means a high quality shotgun mic,but it is fantastic for the price!Well built consumer item.I used it on my Sony VX2100 and it did the job great!"
4,Good enough mic at an afordable price,"Easy to use, reliable and affordable.For the prosumer on the run, that definetly needs to get workable audio."
4,Keep in mind,"I am not sure why the actual cord on this microphone is so short, if you are buying this to use with a camcorder as an off-cam mic, you'll need to purchase an additional cord from like Radio Shack. It also seems to have a cleaner sound in the tele setting."
4,Audio Technica ATR-55 Video Review,Length:: 2:53 MinsFor the short time I have had this mic it seemed great for close up audio recording. This is a short review for the Audio-Technica ATR55 Condenser Shotgun Microphone.This microphone seems to be great... only having it for a few min.But we will see how long it stands up to be so great.
2,Whats up with the hiss that develops!?,"I used my ATR 55 for about 8 weeks and it worked fine. Then it developed a hissing noise. Tried new batteries and it didn't work. It is even worse on the ""tele"" setting! It even seems to be picking up all of the sounds everywhere instead of the sounds right in front of it! It totally ruined one of my productions! What is up with his mic? Do they all go bad like this? Does anyone know how it can be fixed? At first I loved this mic now I think it is garbage!"
3,"MONO, not stereo - buyer beware","Not a bad mic, not bad sound quality, but it is not stereo, which can cause grief (no sound on playback) when trying to edit video in Premiere or playback video using Power DVD etc.If your camera supports mono recording, or a mono-stereo converter jack works for you, then fine. Otherwise, in Premiere, you need to add an Audio effect, such as Effects->Stereo->Fill Left, then you will be able to get the sound audible and playing from both channels.Shame on AT for not saying upfront that this unit is MONO."
1,Save your money and spring for something higher quality,"I understand that this is a budget microphone, but I feel like this would compromise even a project on a shoestring budget. The diaphram distorts with the slightest ""above speaking level"" volume, and this doesn't cancel outside noise, it simply replaces it with a horrible, obnoxious, ever-present HISSSSSSSSSS. Also, for the record, this is not stereo. It will record to either the left or right channel (I can't remember which), and that's it. Save the money you would spend on this, and spring for something higher quality. You will get little to no use out of this, in the long run."
3,not great but not expensive either,"so im going to keep it short. The ""tele"" switch mode does not seem to work on my new Canon Rebel t2i. It records well enough on normal. Here is a recent video. [...]"
4,Mic check,"Cool mic. Received everything new, prompt. Works great on the JVC Everio camcorder, but make sure your close to the subjects. Good combination to use for simple single cam shots or twosomes."
3,Good,"This has good quality for a Mono mic, but its not stereo, plain and simple. You could digitally duplicate the track, but why?"
2,Disappointing. Worse than on camera mic,I purchased and quickly sold two ATR-55's. The mics are very likely to have a whine or drone sound during capture that was worse than my Canon XH-A1's on board mic. They are extremely succeptible to wind noise and the two modes it offers (a wide and a tele) are laughable. I would not purchase these under any circumstance.
3,Better than (cheap)camera audio....,"I found the ATR-55 to be a useable mic for my amatuer videomaking, great for those times when the built in camera microphone is not directional enough. However, the self-noise of the mic is much too high for this mic to be used at any sort of distance, and I found myself constantly trying to get it closer to the sound source so that the microphone's own hiss wouldn't drown out the signal. The ""tele"" setting does more harm than good; it is slightly more directional but much noisier. This mic also has a problem with handling noise: the plastic grommet that holds the cable in place will squeak any time the cable moves. To solve this, you can open the mic and replace the plastic grommet with something less noisy.I would recommend a low cost Azden mic, which would be more expensive but will serve the amatuer videographer much better than this mic."
2,Hard to use,"I bought an ATR-55 a couple of years ago to use with video production at a middle school where I was teaching. It is painfully difficult to use. The amplitude produced by the mike is very low. Using the internal battery, I have to set my software to +30dB gain to get much of anything from it. While the directionality works quite well, the downside is that if it is used where air is moving, forget it. Nothing but noise. You can't really hand-hold it; just the blood moving in your hand will be picked up. With a computer, the vibrations will be heard and with a video camera the zoom and every touch of the tripod will be picked up. Used in a perfectly sterile environment, it is great but for real world, forget it."
2,Worth it,"This is a good product for the price tag. It does the job... One thing! You must keep the viewfinder on the camera closed or you will create a digital hum through the microphone that WILL be on tape. Other than that, it's decent."
5,"Buen producto, pero sólo para ""consumer""","En cuanto a la entrega del pedido, excelente, sin fallas y en el tiempo indicado.Respecto al Audio Technica ATR-55, el microfono es muy bueno, pero yo lo recomendaria solo para consumidores, es decir, este no es un microfono para profesionales ya que tiene una capadidad menor de alcance. En el modo NORMAL, nos da una calidad similar a la del microfono de la camara; pero en el modo TELE obtenemos un radio mayor de alcance.El sonido tiene un buen registro y otra de las cuestiones por la que no lo recomiendo para profesionales, es debido a que el microfono captura en MONO el sonido, lo cual, para alguien que quiera hacer un video serio no es muy bueno.Insisto, recomendable para quienes graban evetnos sociales y cosas por el estilo, pero no para un ""Prosumer""."
3,"Great Cardiod, lame shotgun","This mic is not directional enough to be considered a shotgun mic. The cardiod setting seems to be great. I think it's a little more directional than a regular cardiod. The shotgun setting just boosts the signal though, rather than cutting out sound from the sides.You will probably want a shock mount for this (or any) mic in camera mounted or pole mounted applcations. Otherwise, you'll hear your hands on the camera."
4,Excellent shotgun mike but needs a better mount,The mount creaks a bit on my Canon HV20 hotshoe. I think that a semi-pro rubber shock mount would have worked great instead.
4,It's a SHOTGUN microphone,"Just had to post a response to one of the other comments. This is a SHOTGUN microphone. There is no such thing as a Stereo Shotgun microphone. What would be the point?For that matter, most microphones are mono...period. There is no way I would ever expect a microphone to be stereo unless it was specifically stated.I haven't used this mic, although I have used other AT products with good results. I just have a problem with someone who gives a bad review to a product that they clearly don't understand. It's like someone buying a food processor and complaining that it doesn't keep food hot."
3,Shotgun setting,"I wanted to comment on someone else's comment that the mic's ""shotgun setting just boosts the signal though, rather than cutting out sound from the sides"". Most of you are clearly using this mic for video, whereas I'm using it just inches from my face for VO work (Voice Over). On the ""tele"" setting, the directionality is SO sensitive that I can't use it. If I accidentally moved my mouth just a half inch from one side to the other, I lost it. I have to use the regular setting. There is no doubt whatsoever that the ""tele"" setting makes this mic far more unidirectional. It's not just ""boosting the signal"".If you want a mic for VO work, this is very near the bottom of the scale (for ones that are good enough to use for this purpose), but it was all I could afford at the time, and it's good enough to use for most of my professional work."
4,These run very SMALL!!!! Order at least 1 size larger,"I got these for my dad for xmas. He's an 11.5, so I ordered a 12, but they were still too small, so I had to return them and order a 13."
4,Nice warm slippers !,These slippers are very warm and easy to get in and out of. They work very well for me.
4,High quality but too warm,"These slippers are too warm to wear inside a normally heated house. However, they are quality made, and very comfortable.Order your size plus 1. For example, if you typically wear 9, order 10."
5,Comfy slippers for big feet,I got these for my husband for Christmas. It's hard to find slippers that fit my husband's big feet. This is his second pair. He wears them all the time when at home and the first ones lasted about a year. He likes that they are backless.
4,"Comfortable shoes for indoor use, narrow fit","I wish it was just a little bit wider since it is a pair for indoor use why not widen the slipper to gain more comfort? Besides that fact that it runs on the narrow side of sizes, it is definitely a fall/winter pair of slippers ready for cold air. Maybe not going to be suited to be wore during the summer. All in all, very comfortable."
5,Thank you,Searched high and low for slippers with hard soles to walk to the mailbox in the morning. Great traction and very comfortable. Material is sturdy and toasty warm. This is gong to be a Christmas staple for years to come
5,Comfortable and well made,"Size 16 slippers that are comfortable and stylish are difficult to locate. These are perfect! They fit well, are comfortable and warm. They are well made and seem built to last. They are well worth the price."
4,Nice,"Gave this as a present to my boyfriend. He seems to like it. Keeps his feet warm, very sturdy sole."
2,Responding about product usage,"I am taking this product faithfully, so far have not seen any sign of improvement with the grays.I will continue to take the pills as i want to see whether it,s worth it. Maybe need more time to seeany kind of improvement."
3,If you liked Braveheart check this out!,"I love the movie Braveheart. Recently, I had the pleasure of visiting the beautiful and friendly country of Scotland. I asked several historians and tour guides in Scotland what is the best book to read about the real life of William Wallace. They all suggested this book. The book was pretty good. Its slow a certain spots, and not always the best written. However it is reasonably accurate and at times rather engaging. I did read while in Scotland so that added something extra to make it even better. It is a pretty good read. I also suggest ""On the Trail of William Wallace."""
5,Informative and good reading,"A well written and absorbing read about the great Scottish patriot, even if Tranter seems to drag in parts. It is generally informative and good reading. We learn how Wallace took up arms against the English after Edward I had taken position of much of the country.In 1297 Wallace defeated the English at Stirling Bridge and ravaged the northern counties but the following year Edward beat him at Falkirk. He then went abroad but to seek help but failing to obtain it he returned to Scotland to carry on guerilla warfare from 1303 to 1305, when he was betrayed and captured at Glasgow. Taken to London for trial he was executed the same year and the four parts of his body sent to Scotland to be displayed in the principal towns.This is the story of his struggle and the travails of Scotland at this time, the motivations of William Wallace and of the Scottish people. More historically correct by far than Mel Gibson's Braveheart."
2,not optimized for Kindle,For the money the publishers get (and the paper saved): Could they please optimize the content for the kindle reader? I really don't feel like paying good money and then being forced to zoom in on every single strip and seeing all the space wasted around. Please arrange them 2x2 instead of 1x4 !
5,Perfect introduction to the carillon...,"James Lawson plays the carillon at the Crystal Cathedral, a unique instrument because of its major-third overtones as opposed to the typical minor-third overtones of a carillon. The Cathedral Carillon has a particularly rich sound, which Lawson harnesses with a flair in his arrangements of hymns tunes and recognizable classics. The carillon has long been known as the most democratic of instruments, and Lawson plays it as it should be heard--with music people know and love.This recording is very relaxing as well, and is of paticular use as focus music for prayer or small worship settings, or for listening at the end of a long day."
4,Super book for Volvo 240's,"It is really a super detailed book.The only problem for me is that I'm in europe and there we have a small difference in motor types. I have a B200F, which is a 2.0 liter motor.Unfortunately this type of motor is not handled is this book, but it is almost the same as a B21/B23."
4,Bentley Service Manual,This Bentley service manual has lot more in it than the other service manuals have. It provides alot of info on how to identify your vehicle. It has more info on how different parts of you vehicle work and are repaired. Unfortunely it does not have a lot of engine teardown and reassembly info in it. It is easier to read than the others. It is worth the money I paid for it.
3,Live Joey Revisited,"I am a fan of Bill Henderson and I got this CD because I, particularly, thought it contained a rendition of the song ""Joey"" that I had heard before. This one does not compare. Are there earlier recordings by Bill Henderson?"
3,Very good book,"A must have if you are a DFX owner. It could still be writtern better, but its one of the best on the market today."
4,Boxcar!!!!,This is a great representation of this artist's work. It has some great song that will touch both the young and old.
3,gift,item was received in short amount of time and in good condition. Appeared to play fine and was a gift for a fan of the artist
4,IMA SURI DONDAII !,"Not as daunting as some other Magma efforts, in fact this would be a good ""entry-level"" Magma disc for some who may be put off by the heavier martial and operatic stylings of other Magma albums. Here, they cover lots of ground from frantic fusion (""The Last Seven Minutes"") to Gospel (""Spiritual""), neo-classical/operatic (""Rindi"")and even R&B; (""Dondaii, To An Eternal Love"").All throughout, theres ton's of great musicianship to be had, Christian Vander's manic drumming, the dual male/female operatic lead vocals sung in the band's made up language of Kobaian, and that cool angry roaring fuzz-bass, so much a vital part of Magma's sound.Very worthwhile if you have even the slightest adventurous streak."
5,the day I discover Magma,"Nobody can stay indifferent to magma's music. The first time I heard it: I hated it, then, a friend of mine made me listen to ATTAHK, especialy the last song which is called NONO. I'll never forget this day, because it is the day I have learned the real sense of the word MUSIC. ps: please excuse my bad english"
2,Very Enchanting Music,"This is the first I have heard of such a band. I am open to new and this truely different in a freaky kind of way. Great Beats to lyrics I can't understand but, love because of the vocal tracks. They are like another instrument in the band. I still can't give this a high rating because I can not enjoy this everyday. It is intriguing enough to recommend. If you like this you should check out Fantomas because of using vocals as an instrument but, laid over cartoon metal."
3,"Lets make a film , QUICK!!","As truly reported by G Trevi herself, this made was quickly made and it shows... poor image quality and some bad takes kept anyaway... still the film is a big hit due to the huge success of the raising star, eveybody wanted to see her if not live in a concert at least on film! and that is what the film delivers: songs in the middle of a poor plot."
4,Fabulous!,"The durability of this toy is fantastic. We've dropped it and even run over it (with a bike) and it's in great shape. We've lost most of the removeable pieces, but my daughter loves playing with all of her Ponys in this and other Ponyville pieces. I really enjoy all the detail and the colors. It's delightful for her and for me!"
2,Huge Reduction in Quality,"I've bought many of these over the past few years and been very happy with them, but this time they arrived as an almost unrecognizable product. The new fabric is cheap and flimsy and there is maybe 1/3 of the amount of stuffing there used to be. Very disappointing. Did they think we wouldn't notice?? These are going back and now I'm going to have to find a replacement from a different manufacturer."
2,Not anywhere near 6 inches thick????,"The description on this says 6 inches thick:Product Dimensions: 15 x 20 x 6 inches ; 2.2 poundsI assumed this meant the edges as the measurements would be at the highest point, but it is nowhere near that thick. I would estimate its 3-4 inches at the edges and 1 to 1.5 inches in the middle.I like the way these look - they are simple and clean looking and not so prominent in my house (i have 2 in my living room) and I didn't like how overpowering the other beds were.However, I have them on tile so I don't think there is enough cusion and can tell my dogs are not crazy about them so I may have to put additional padding under them or on top or move them to a room with carpet and buy something else for the tiled room.If they actually were as thick as advertised these would be perfect."
2,SnooZZy Original Fleece Pet Bed,"As a previous owner of at least eight Quiet Time Pet Beds, I was willing to try for a better product.... The SnooZZy may be the ""Original"" Fleece Pet Bed, but it is a definitely not better. The fleece feels lighter weight than the Quiet Time and the bolster around the edges (doggy pillow) is definitely smaller. SnooZZy not worth the higher price. I will go back to the Quiet Time Beds.... and yes, I know they too have a variation in fleece quality. Haven't washed the SnooZZy bed yet, so can't comment on washability."
3,It's easy to pull the cotton out...,"Overall it's okay, easy to wash and dry very quickly. But my puppy likes to bite on it and pull the cotton out....The bed is getting thinner and thinner now...next time I'll buy those flat surface one."
4,Cheap way to get the dog off the cold floor,"The bed is very thin in the center...where the dog lies, but at least it keeps him off the cold tile. The edges are raised a little which gives him somewhere to put his head. The small is JUST BIG ENOUGH to hold a 9 pound pomeranian.Overall, for the price, it works well. Only problem is that Walgreens was having a sale on pet beds and had beds that were much bigger, fluffier and nicer for $10."
4,Kitty Bed,"The day I put this down for my Kitty, he was in it within 15 minutes and then every day after he was in it all the time. He loved it."
3,It's OKAY.,"It's not as soft as it looks in the picture. But it does the trick, & the cats don't seem to mind."
4,The cat and I agree,"My husband's cat doesn't like beds with high sides, and I don't like his hair all over the place, so we use inexpensive beds like these placed in his favourite spots to encourage him to nap there and not on the clean towels I'm trying to fold. The extra small size is perfect for his spot on the couch, and I can wash and dry the cat bed instead of having a permanently hairy, cat dander-y spot on the couch. The beds aren't expensive, so when they won't take another wash, I just get another. Cat is happy and so am I...win-win!"
1,poems by a vulcan?,"I hate to sound too negative, but it speaks well of contemporary poetry that this volume is out of print. Nimoy is a better actor than he is a poet; these verses are unbearably sentimental and metrically uninspired."
2,dud,"i suspect i bought a lemon since a model (La Pavoni Lusso) with the same pump has been fabulous. the Portofino yields poor crema if any, is awkward to fill (it's tank is located in the back with a low small hole for filling) and- despite it's sturdy metal body and impressive weight- is a crappy machine."
3,Made in Italy - Old school manufacturing - by hand...,"Pros:Steel casing with brass inner tubing (must be hand made)Heavy & Sturdy (built like a tank)Heats up fastPriceCons:Messy (appears the distance from cup to filter is higher than normal resulting in a slight spattering of espresso)Awkward water resivor (need a steady hand to poor water into the res.)The brand and model graphics are stickers (yes, stickers)Don't get this if you're a beginner. You need patience to get it right and a burr grinder is mandatory. Only after 12+ attempts do I start experimenting a good crema. Frother works very well for that perfect cappuccino.There is NO artificial crema contraption like in other ""low"" cost machines that use filters with smaller than normal pin holes. Therefore practice is necessary.Sweeten your espresso with pure vermont maple syrup (the expensive stuff)..."
2,Constantly Jams Wasting Time and Paper,"I print two hundred plus page documents, up to 15 at a time, I bought this one to replace the 4250 tn I had purchased years earlier and which I worked to death. This one however jams frequently wasting time, paper, and making endless frustration. Other times it will print the document perfectly. I expect based on this experience I likely will always buy new in the future as this printer is so maddening!"
3,Rated to 750 Joules,"Not really a great Joules rating for a true multi-media system, but better and cheaper than what's available at your local Walmart or Target. Fry's might have a competitive offering."
4,A sheer delight,"I really rate this a 4 1/2. Not absolutely perfect--some of the singers do not have operatic voices but voices more suitable to musical comedy--but really fine for this production. And some of the costumes just don't fit, especially Ottile's pantsuit--in the era of Franz Joseph! But over all, a must watch performance. I bought it despite the bad review on Amazon and am glad I did. My friend and I enjoyed the whole performance; indeed my friend gave it a 5 star rating. I was humming the music for hours after it was over and I intend to watch it again fairly soon. By the way, we thought the acting and choreography were just great--particularly loved the scene with the cows. If you love Viennese operettas, you will love this one."
1,Super Switch Wireless Remote,This super switch wireless remote does not function well compared to other products.Sometimes it works and sometimes it does not work. It's very irritating.
2,Super Switch Stopped Working after 7 months,"We bought our Super Switch in November 2008. It is the black one with 2 switches and a remote. It stopped working this past June 2009. We switched to the second one (it comes with 2) and it stopped working after 2 days, it must be something in the plug in that shorted it out. If anyone has had this problem let me know.When I bought it I thought is was awsome, I was so bummed when it quit working!"
1,not for me,"After plugging and connecting, I could not get more than 8 inches away from the plug before it stopped working. Sent it back. Didn't work well."
1,Customer service not available for this product!,"Try contacting Superswitch (Blackstone) regarding a problem with their product. No response. They have no customer service. It's hard to believe that some manufacturers (in this case the US reps) only want to sell their product and if a problem arises, they hide. Check the warrantee from the seller. After that, you're on your own."
1,Defective,"Sorry to say both switches lasted a few days then problems started. Both would turn off by themselves then later on turn on again. I had a single lamp attached so it couldn't have been overloaded. Then, one of the switches ""assumed"" the properties of a third remote we had in the house. I sent note to supplier and will return the switches."
4,great little gadget,"I needed something to replace my Clapper. Since it wasn't the holiday season, there were no Clappers available at local stores, so I found this product. It is perfect for my bedside because when I finish reading my Kindle at night, I can just push one button to turn off the light."
1,bad product,"I am very disappointed with this product. I used it for a week before it quit working and when I looked in the instruction manual for help it was a zero. No number to call, no help at all. I guess when you buy cheap you get cheap. I've learned my lesson!"
1,You can get the cheaper in stores,You can get the cheaper in stores. I didn't realize it until I got this - but lowes sells them with more then one and much cheaper
5,Great convenience,Arrived fast. Came with special battery for the remote (like a short version of AAA) and it works like a charm. Use it on my family room lamp as it is in a far corner.
1,Malfunctioned shortly after install. Not made well.,"I bought this to control some cable lighting I installed above some tall cabinets as offset lighting. At install, the controller was finicky about where to point it to make it work. But a couple days later when I tried to get the lights on, I had to hold it a foot away from the outlet to make it work--sometimes. I bought a name brand one at the local hardware store for $2 more and it works perfectly from virtually anywhere in my house. This one is not well made and not reliable; I won't be buying anything this brand again ever."
1,what you won't read,"This switch has a built in 4 hour timer. So if whatever you have plugged into it is turned off for more than 4hrs, you have to reactivate the device with the remote or manually.Example:I used it to turn off the living room lights from my bedroom at night. When I wake up in the morning, I hit the remote and turn the lights on. Then I turn off the lights manually before leaving for work. Then, in the evening, when I come home to a dark house, I either have to move the couch to turn the device on manually, or fumble my way to my bedroom to hit the remote. Were it not for this built in timer, which you can't turn off, it would be a good product."
2,Super Switch short lived,"This wireless switch was easy to install and worked great for about three weeks. But then it stayed locked in the on position, even though the little red power light goes off and on with getting a signal from the remote controller. I called Northern Tool and Equipment and they just said sorry, no warranty on that device. I had probably used it a total of 15 cycles when it failed."
5,Amazing!,"It used to take me 10-15 minutes to walk around my home and light the many Christmas decorations that I have. Now, that time has been cut in thirds. I just push the buttons and voila! Wonderful!"
4,Remote Wireless,"Remote control delivered was not as pictured above. It only had one button not three. However it does do the job I envisioned because I only needed it for one outlet. No harm, no foul this time. But product sent should be as advertised."
3,Simple,"The dancing in this dvd is good, but the music in the background is monotonous and uninspiring to dance to. This is a two dvd set. The the first dvd is all about the moves. It teaches basic upgrooves (footwork), locking (point, wrist), a few bboy moves (apache, charley-rock), and how to put together a rountine from the moves you learn. The second disc contains extended mixes I guess you can dance to after you learn the basic moves in disc one. Disc one has a running time roughly about 35-40 mins which is fairly short. But if you don't know how to dance like myself, then this dvd is better than nothing at all."
4,getting there,Just got this dvd. I think I'll get most of the moves. (some spinal limitations due to arthritis) But overall I liked it. I'm obviously new to hip hop.
1,Where is the breakdown?,"I was so excited for my Groovaloos DVD to come, but I was very disappointed. The dancers take 5x more effort showing off then actually teaching steps. There is no step breakdown, no counting, no different views. They basically do the dance 1 time at a medium pace and expect you to just catch on from there. I watched it twice and decided to throw it in the junk box."
5,do yourself the favour and read this book . . .,"this book is unusually thruthful and gripped me from the beginning to the very end - maybe because of the fact that I have something in common with Franklin. So convincinglty written , I'd like to have met the protagonist !"
2,Comical,"Comical is the best word to describe John D. McKenzie's book Uncertain Glory. It should be considered a work of creative fiction and not a serious history book. The research is shallow, the review is cursory and assumptions are never fully developed. The accuracy in the book is also in question since on page 254 Mr. McKenzie has the battle of the crater taking place on ""July 30, 1964."" This book could have been a remarkable treatise had any serious time been spend exploring artillery placement, troop deployment and southern economic conditions. It would have also been useful to use the opinions of modern military experts to bolster his position. Having studied the Civil War seriously for many years, I find the book to be bankrupt of any serious historical fact (that has not already been discussed) is not worth serious academic consideration."
2,Worth reading!,"I agree with the criticisms submitted. The book is an analysis of Lee's generalship. It suffers from the absence of Lee's personal account. As a result, a lot of conjecturing and second guessing occurs. The first hand research documenting and supporting his arguments is not as rigorous.Having said that I still think it is worthwhile reading. It does offer an alternative view of Lee's leadership. His theme is not a new one. Even Burke Davis had remarked on the apotheosis of Lee after the war. The book examines Lee's field decisions and style of command. By emphasizing the difference between strategic and tactical issues as well as examining patterns of Lee's tactical decisions, it increased my appreciation of some of the nuances in troop placement and topography. For amateur history buffs of the civil war, it is a worthwhile read especally since my local library has a copy. Would I buy it? probably not the hardcover edition."
5,Great purchase,I would definitely recommend this wheel cover. I received the item quickly and without any trouble at all. Two thumbs up!
5,super grip,slipped on easy on my Acura TL. grip is comfortable and makes driving a lot funner knowing superman is with me.
2,Meh...,"I was hoping this cover would provide more ""grip"" as my steering wheel is irritatingly slippery (especially when it's cold). The rubber parts do the job but the leatherlike vinyl material between the three rubber bits is just as slippery as my plastic wheel. In addition, the threading between the rubber and vinyl material is rapidly unravelling. Oh well, you get what you pay for and at least it partially works. Plus, my little nephew thinks the Superman ""S"" is kewl... :D"
1,Dissatisfied,"Not happy with the whole experience with this particular item. First, I received a damaged item, I returned it, the replacement was also damaged, I returned it as well. Then, I got an e-mail saying that I will get a reimbursement for the item and that the item will not be replaced. A few days later (on 11/30), I got another e-mail confirming receiving the returned item and saying that it will be replaced. As of today 12/12 I haven't received anything nor have I seen a credit made to my Credit Card."
5,All Is Good,Receieved the cd's in great shape. It was great doing business with this seller!!!! Five Stars!
5,Excellent Offensive Line book,Great reference for both players and coaches. Gives detail of how to play the line position. Plus talks more than just about X's and O's. For a high school player just getting started gives him all the tools to take him to the next level.
1,Don't expect much,"I purchased this book because of the editorial review thinking that it was all that and more. This book is an overview of the most basic O-line info. No call system, no blocking schemes no nothing. If your looking for detailed techniques, drills and such this book is NOT it."
1,A generic and almost useless manual,"I've been a professional IE for more than 15 years and I bought this ""manual"" thinking that it would actually be a summary of the most important tools used in this profession, but I realized that it is not. It is way to general and it has lost most of the formulas and calculations that are required as an IE. There is too much wording and too little math. If you are a manager and you don't care for the how to, this is good for you. If you are in the field, and you need a quick reference on how to calculate things and how to implement them , you got to look for another book."
2,OK,This is only a reference book if you want to refresh your concepts. I bought it when I graduated and only used it twice since then. I would not recommend it.
2,"Demasiado volumen, poco didáctico.","El voluminoso libro consiste en un compendio de diferentes artículos que cubren múltiples aspectos del campo de la Ingeniería Industrial, todos ellos descritos por autoridades en la materia (principalemente profesores de Universidad).Justamente es el enfoque lo que hace ser un texto casi de introducción para cada uno de los temas tratados. La amplitud de los temas, son de tal calibre que o bien la descripción queda corta o bien el autor quiere incluir el máximo de detalle que llega a ser intratable como introducción.Cada uno de los capítulos, son de por sí temas que merecen una descripción más detallada en libros por separado.Para mi gusto, el mismo objetivo se cubre ampliamente en los libros del profesor Roger G. Schroeder (Operations Management), con una didáctica muchísimo más clara y con ejemplos más actualizados.Carlos Ortega2006-01-30"
3,Arguably the best in the series,"This movie sees Kunta Kinta, aka Toby as an old man, with the blacks now being civilized living as slaves. The only better is the first entry in the 6 tape set of the Roots movies, which aired on American TV in the 1970s and broke ratings records for TV that I believe still stand today. The movies in the series get progressively more racist as the Afro Americans were kept alive and forced into civil slavery. The N word is used about 20 times during the movie."
3,a bit disappointing,"I love Lynn Kurland's books and I really wanted to like this one, but IMHO it was not up to the standard she has set in ""My Heart Stood Still"", and ""Another Chance to Dream""-- just two of my favorites. The female protagonist in the story is not a strong character, and the male protagonist is not well drawn. The plot itself seemed forced and felt 'flat'. When the story was finished, I really didn't know these two people, and didn't care as much about their failures and successes.I know that not every book an author writes is their best work. I think that's the case here. If you are new to Lynn Kurland, start with ""A Dance Through Time"". If you're already hooked on Lynn's stories, this one won't dissuade you from looking forward eagerly to reading her next offering, but be forewarned that she's not at her best here."
2,Not Kurland's Best...,"Being an avid Kurland fan, I was expecting a bit more from this book. I have read most of her books and was surprised she wrote this one -- the characters did not pop off the page and I did not really like the Butcher of Berkhamshire. I found him to be a bumbling man, who did not really have anything in his character to even show how he got the nickname, ""The Butcher."" Frankly, he annoyed me.As for Alienore, she was a very contradictory character. She was tough and fought like the knight she was pretending to be, but she was a wimp at letting Etienne blackmail her with her identity. I have read books where I sympathized with a character's plight between confessing a dark secret that could ruin her image/future, but this ""secret"" was just too much to bear.If you love Lynn Kurland's books, like me, you will save your time and avoid this one. It just isn't worth your time reading -- go for a walk or watch a movie instead."
1,No thanks,"This was my first and last Kurland book. How can you describe a hero as smelly and not rectify it by the end. Who would want to kiss or be with a man who smells. Is this humor? And also, why no romance in an historical romance novel? We didn't even get to enjoy the first kiss let alone any hint at intimacy. But then again who would want to read about intimacy laced with body odors?"
2,No payoff,"I was ok with the idea that the hero isn't perfect, it gets tedious only reading about those men without flaws! It was tedious though, that the heroine squeeks and cries a lot, I couldn't see what he saw in her. It was odd too that the villian was included on every journey, even though everybody knew he was bad. Disappointing that we don't get to finally experience ""the first kiss,"" that happened ""behind closed doors."""
1,From this Moment On,"For me it was a bore and absolutely un-Kurland like. Usually I can't put her books down, but this time I only finished it because I was on a flight from LA to Atlanta and had no other choices.I usually wait for her next offer, but I think I'll have to pass on it unless she gets 5 star reviews.Sorry"
2,Too Long,"I was really looking forward to Colin's story which is why I wanted to give it 3 stars instead of 2. The book is too long at 418 pages. About page 234 I had enough. The villian beats up Alienore (French for Eleanor?), again, threatens to tell Colin, again, and she folds up, again. Meanwhile you have spent the last 200 pages reading about how he is teaching Alienore how to fight. Also, by this time she should know Colin would never hurt her no matter what has been said. Colin's character seemed to be a lot sharper in Gillian and Christopher's story, here he is a little dim. What's so amusing about pages of Colin and Alienore fighting/teaching in the mud? I finally skipped about 50 pages of ""will he slice my head off or won't he"", finished it last night and sit here really annoyed about this book. There is no sexual tension in this story. The courting part was rushed, and the story drags on at the end. If, like me, you wanted to read Colin's story, get it from the library, don't buy it."
2,Hoped for a better story,"I loved Colin in This is all I ask. I was looking forward to reading about his romance. There wasn't much, if any, romance to speak of. Read the other 1 and 2 star reviews and you'll know what the problems are with the story."
1,"Bad Odor, Bad Humor","How can you have a real hero who smells bad, burps at the table and wipes his mouth on the tablecloth or his sleeve? Yuck. This book is far too long, spending most of its time on scenes of Colin teaching Alienore to fight. It has a very thin plot, has a hero you can't possibly want to take home, and a heroine that spends her time quaking and squeeking. The attempt at humor, such as when Colin accidently breaks Alienore's nose, and when he faints several times at seeing his newborn daughter are ridiculous...but not funny. This book is a waste of the author's writing time and my reading time."
1,What Happened,"I Love everthing written by Lynn Kurland, I wait franticly each year for her new books. HOWEVER,this is not her best book. It was wa[...]y to long, the characters were not believable. I mean come on any idiot would have figured things out and for suspense she tryed to drag things out. All it did was bore me to tears which is sad because I think Lynn is an excellent writter. Perhaps she wasnt as inspired by these characters as she usually is. Whatever it was It was hard to read, instead of hard to put down which is how I normaly feel. good luck getting through this book. ITS BORING."
1,I'd rather have a can of PBR,"You can tell the author had enthusiasm for his subject, but the writing comes across like he's just jumping on a bandwagon - and slightly late at that. I found myself wincing at the ""good ole boy"" language and the tries at making sloppy drunkenness funny. I like a good beer or three, but I wouldn't want to drink them with this author."
4,A great book for beer-lovers everywhere!,"With a great sense of style and character Greg Nicoll reviews a multitude of beers and gives his perspective on the world of fine ales, stouts, and lagers. A great book to take with you to strange or foreign bars if you are feeling adventurous. Besides a good tounge-in-cheek reference guide, this book is also a great read."
2,Tepid Brew: I don't recommend it.,"I'll probably return this book to my dealer and say I was given a second as a gift. I got about a third of it read, with mounting irritation at the book's ineptitude, before I gave up. For me it was a crashing bore. Better suited for the lavatory lads still wet behind their ears. One got the distinct feeling that the author is that sort and was pitching it to those who just want to pound down lots of beer without real discrimination or taste."
1,"as a whole, not worth reading","The book is mainly concerned with educational theory. It is not a good choice for a reader interested in practical aspects of online teaching. Since each chapter is written by a different author, their quality varies. From reading 35 of the 52 chapters, selected at random, I found only 9 chapters useful or interesting: Ch. 7, 9, 11, 12, 19, 21, 22, 26, 40. Most of the remaining chapters are, in my opinion, without substance."
1,Outdated and redundant,"I just finished reading this book from cover to cover and I wish someone could refund me for my time.It is seriously outdated, many of the concepts are way too simple and other times they contradict themselves. For example, on one chapter you are told to use graphics to make the page more attractive and on the next chapter you are told not to so that students can download the web pages faster.Some chapters will talk down to you as if you were in Junior High, others will make no sense and not cover what they are supposed to cover (chapter 56 - Teaching Literature on the World Wide Web, comes to mind)Don't waste your time with this book, there are better choices out there.I can only recomend this book to someone who has absolutely NO knowledge whatsoever about the web nor web-based instruction. And I would only recomend a small number of chapters, probably no more than 5."
3,"nice lamps, poor switch","These Hella lamps are pretty nice for the price, with metal housing and sturdy bracket. The shortcoming is in the switch, which broke after about 5 minutes of use. It would stick on, then stick off, then broke entirely. Swapping switches isn't a terrible job, but it shouldn't have to be done right out of the box."
3,Murder and mystery...,"FALLEN SNOW, a gritty street tale, takes you deep into the world of drugs, murder, incest, homosexuality, adultery, fornication, crooked cops and dirty politicians. FALLEN SNOW is action packed from beginning to end, but the many errors in punctuation, the lack of story breaks between characters and scenes, and the vulgarity, detracted so much from the story that I was not fully able to appreciate it.Reviewed by Renee Williamsof The RAWSISTAZ ReviewersComplete review can be found on our website..."
4,Real Good!!!!!!,I really enjoy reading this book. It kept my attention very fast pace....just need some editing other than that real good read!!!!!!
1,Revolting and Shameful,"I forced myself to read the first few chapters and then threw this ""book"" into the trash. I have never read such a revolting, unnecessary use of language to describe smut, gore, drugs, sex or religion. This tale portrays the worst of human nature. Totally unbelieveable(...)"
2,Meh.,"Bit of a bore I'm afraid. If you've seen the movie, you know that not a whole-helluva-lot happens for the first half (read: 150 pages!), and by that time - if you're as impatient as I - you'll give up on it. Like I did."
1,bizarre,Very strange movie; hard to follow. I read the book first and still had trouble figuring out what was going on!
4,Good basic text for a high school law class!,"I bought this book to use as a resource to teach a law class to Juniors and Seniors at a Charter School for motivated learners. This book has been a godsend when it comes to structuring my course, as there are NO TEXTBOOKS out there that cover the wide spectrum of the law, without fluff or opinion. I hope to adopt this book as our class text book for next year, as it is so information-packed and so informative that I find myself practically lecturing right out of the book! I recommend it to other teachers, and to anyone who wants to learn about all the types of law. It would be very helpful to students considering a career in the law, who want to know what types of law exist. It is also a convenient-to-carry size with larger type so that it is easy to understand and read."
3,I am a Coach,"I coach lev 1-3 and I love coaching bars..I was really expecting the basics to a lot of drills and skills. this is more for higher level coaches..but again i want someone to tell me this is good form, this is bad form, this is right this is wrong...I love detail in what I learn and then want to teach...maybe I expect to much not sure...some coaches will get lots from this just not what I am looking for..plus I bought her whole dvd set which wasnt cheap so far not much to learn from and take to the gym....."
5,The infinit possibilities of color,"This book does not teach how to mix, quantities and such but how color mixes. It shows the different possibilities in color mixing. The ratios of each color is up to the painter."
4,Excellent reference,This book is an excellent reference for the beginner and advanced traditional painter. I am glad I have this book for time efficient paint mixing
2,not for oil painters,The book is a sampler of color combinations in water-based media. I feel that it would focus a student too much on 'right or wrong' rather than on finding their own answers and experimentation based on principles and theory.
2,Bad Book,When I recieved the book the cover was not attacted to the book and the whole book fell apart and this was a gift for someone and I was very embrassed when she open the book and it fell out of the cover.
5,Even came with an adapter bolt,"I got this to use on my monopod made by someone else, so I can leave my Bogen plate on my camera regardless of using my tri- or monopod. I knew I'd need an adapter bolt, but I was not expecting this head to come with one."
5,Very nice for my needs,"Very well made and looks like it will hold up for a very long time! I'm not a professional photographer, far from it, but I don't think you can go wrong with this if you have a DSLR without a huge telephoto lens to support. I have an Olympus E-500 system and it's great with this!"
1,Horrible Head,"I own several Bogen-Manfrotto heads and tripods. I was convinced to purchase this one for a mono-pod and hate it. It takes so long to adjust the tilt back to horizontal after adjusting it that I always leave it set in the same place.It is solid but no more useful than just using a quick-release plate. If I anticipate using the mono-pod a lot in the field, I take another head to use instead."
2,Not good for use with a camcorder,"I purchased this item especially for use with a camcorder. As soon as I opened the package, I knew I was going to be unhappy. The controls for the head (both the tilt and the plate release) are directly where you would need to place your hands to operate the camcorder's zoom as well as hold onto the cammie itself. I still gave it a trial run, and after less than 5 minutes, it became too uncomfortable to continue using.This item is more than likely perfect for use with a camera, but since that was not my intended use, I just can't justify giving it a high rating."
3,quick release,"The Bogen swivel tilt head was recommended as a 'must have' to accent the monopod I also purchased... a solidly built unit but totally usless with any monopod. I would give it 5 stars for quality/sturdyness... but zero stars for functionality, with a monopod. The quick relase is usefull however... but doesnt help in photography, just the camera removal. Best to get a REAL tripod with these features already there!"
5,Chorale music at its best,"For those who appreciate tight 8 part harmony, the Westminster choir is top-notch. The songs are a beautiful mix of ballads and upbeat melodies, done to perfection. Anyone who has ever song in a choir or who just appreciates beautiful choral music will love this CD."
1,this is not the choir of Westminster Cathedral,Don't be fooled like I was. Nowhere does it say that this is the Westminster Choir College in New Jersey. I believed it to be from the choir of Westminster Cathedral in England but I was fooled. Even the cover doesn't say Westminster College except in small print at the bottom of the back side. I wish I had seen that before I took off the cellophane wrapper; now I can't even return it.I suppose it's nice music but it's not what I wanted.
1,Worthless.,"I am a research entomologist, specializing in urban pests, particularly cockroaches and termites. I ordered this title, thinking that it might be a reference that I had overlooked. I shouldn't have bothered. This looks like the barely formatted output from a literature search from one of the scientific databases with some primitive indexing on authors and key words. It includes 138 references published from 1991-1995, a small fraction of the relevant literature published during that period. Abstracts are not included. The indexes cover pages 21-106, the actual references pages 107-157. The only ""text"" has nothing to do with the alleged subject. The whole thing appears to be photocopied, single-sided, and mounted in a cheap plastic report binder. The length of this item is grossly inflated since it was printed in large type with wide margins.I would actually argue that this is not a book in the sense that most people would understand the term. Don't waste your time."
1,BORING & TERRIBLE!,"This book was awful. The writing was terrible, the story was NOT engaging. The novel is basically about two girls living in poverty in New York City, when the Brooklyn bridge is being built. The two characters are both incredibly annoying, as well as their foil, who they refer to as the ""Do-Gooder"" - everyone is irritating, and you could really care less about them. When tragedy strikes the main characters, you honestly DON'T CARE, and can't wait for the story to be over. I skimmed probably the last 50 - 60 pages of the book. The only reason I kept reading it was because I had already read 100 pages and felt like I had to read the rest. Interesting idea, but terribly executed, terribly written, and terribly boring."
2,North Korea is not Canada,"There are some good aspects of this book analysing the ins and outs (mostly outs) of United States policy toward North Korea and its nuclear program. But the book has one enormous drawback: it treats everything that the United States and its allies did with suspicion, while giving North Korea every benefit of the doubt. I did not understand the expression ""blame America first"" until I read this book. There is nothing in this book about North Korean terrorism or attacks on the South Korean Blue House. Mr. Sigal treats North Korea as if it were Canada. It is not. His good points would come through better if he was not so one-sided."
2,A Good History Book,"If you want to know all about the historical events of the summer of 1810 when the French advanced into Portugal and the British, Spanish, and Portuguese response to it; this is the book for you. It is full of details of battle scenes and the boring life of the officers in between. If I had liked the characters it would have been easier to get involved in the history, but they were not likable or even believable. It's all about a woman who dedicates her life to getting revenge after witnessing the rape of her sister. She, because of her beauty, ensnares and manipulates every man she ever comes in contact with, including the hero who is a bitter man due to uncontrollable life circumstances. I think it is an insult to men to believe that they could all be manipulated into doing almost anything just because a woman is beautiful. A well written book, but definitely not my cup of tea."
5,Spectacular,This is the ultimate torch song collection. It has new and older singers interpreting some of our most wonderful songs from the days when lyrics were everything! I was given a copy as a hostess gift and had to rush to buy this two cd set for my best friend. The Diana Krall track is my favorite - truly spectacular!
4,Love this cd!,Cd arrived on time and in excellant condtion. This is a great cd for those rainy and snowy days of winter. I love every recording on this cd.
5,Happy to have Happy,"I am so thrilled to have come across this cd. I cannot believe it wasn't a bigger success. I didn't even realize Real Life made anything after the '80s, but when I came across it on here, I had to check it out. From the first listen, this album became one of my favorites of all time. It's perfect. There is a ton of variety, yet all the songs have an underlying, almost comedic darkness to them. There isn't a bad track on here. My two least favorites are probably ""Satisfied"" and ""Deep Sleep,"" but even they are great songs that I rarely skip past. My favorites are ""Virus,"" ""I Did What I Did,"" and ""Learning How To Breathe,"" followed closely by ""Everything Explodes,"" ""Girl Jesus,"" ""Skin,"" and ""Meltdown."" The entire thing is an innovative masterpiece. Many of the sounds common to today's synthpop, futurepop, and EBM can be found on Happy. Highly recommended. I'm hoping it's re-released soon...maybe under A Different Drum??? *hint hint*"
3,Another dumb game,"I was fooled that the game has elements of ""strategy""; there are hardly any. The game itself is very well made and fun, would be fantastic for a 2.5 year old. I was looking for a game that requires some thinking for my 3.5 year old. This ain't it. I would recommend games such as ""Rush hour"", ""Royal rescue"", ""Zookeeper's nightmare"", ""Sequence for kids"" - they all have elements of strategy or logic. This game is a simple ""roll and move"" game, good for introducing the concept of a board game, nothing more. If a child can think, this game seems a waste of time. The fun element is modest at best. For that I would recommend ""Zingo""."
2,Expected something better,"I purchased the Anton Corbin Star Trak book after watching a documentary on his work recently and I was blown away at the quality of his black and white work. Unfortunately, this book for some reason is completely printed in this weird sepia coloured tone making a majority of the images look rather flat and wishy washy. If they were printed the way they were meant to look, this book could have rated amongst one of the best books I've got but now it has gone amongst the bottom of the photography book pile due to the way it was printed."
4,Great CD,"I am a big fan of this organ...especially since it's fate hangs in the balance. This is the Great Organ of Washington National Cathedral. Originally a Skinner, then AEolian Skinner, now a little bit of everything. The works on this CD are great and they do the instrument justice. Worth your money."
4,Better than expected,"My first book of Delany was Babel 17, followed by Empire star, and I must say that I was dissappointed upon finishing them. So, I kinda picked this one with careful consideration, wanting to give Delany one more chance to astound me, and he did. Whatever lacked at those first two books, you'll find in this one. World that he built resembles our own in such scary details that you actually start to wonder would you be better of dead? Interwoven with ancinent myths of Oprheus and Euridice, or to say with quest for love long lost, which was a common theme in the elder days, this book will draw a tear into your eyes. Though rather short, it will seem that it lasted for ages. Why four stars? After all the praises that I have spoken I still cannot escape from that fact that conversation in the book is obviusly patterned, or to say, nobody speaks or has converation in that way...."
1,The Einstein Intersection,"The Emperor has No ClothesThis is a fantasy a drunk college sophomore could have written after having taken Introduction to Greek Mythology. The book is poorly written, self-indulgent, and inelegant. The story is simplistic (a country bumpkin through trials and travelling to the big city becomes self-aware). The characters, products of a genetic pot-luck, have strange bodies and one dimensional personalities. There is only a smattering of science. The book bandies pop, historical, and literary references to no purpose except to convince gullible readers that the writer is ""profound."""
1,Guesswork.... Not Research,"If you are simply looking for a biography of Coltrane, only trust Lewis Porter's ""John Coltrane: His Life And Music"" [U of Michigan Press]. Porter's book is well researched. This ""Ascension"" book is a waste of your money. The author only stated his impressions after listening to LPs by Coltrane - it's just a guesswork (not research)."
2,Disappointing Despite High Ambitions,"This book is overall a waste of resources and time considering there are already many other books about Coltrane. This book certainly does not add anything special to the topic. In particular, the author's lack of knowledge about modern jazz music (he seems to think that Marsalis is all there is today) makes his conclusion (where he tries to address Coltrane's influence) rather pathetic."
4,Ignore the naysayers.,"So the author tries to link things like Coltrane's music and unified field theory? So what? I didn't care. I found this book to be very informative and fun to read. I'm not sure what some of the complainers were expecting(?) If you are new to Coltrane this is a decent book to give you an idea of his impact on the times and on Jazz music. If you want something with more meat and discussions of Trane's music and music theory, try Lewis Porter's recent book on him."
3,"Nice assortment, fresh, sent as gift","Sent this as a gift to a man. He is pleased to have them in his pantry, but is not raving about how grate they are. No complaints. Price was good."
2,Same page for $ 12.58 !,"What is going on , I found these for $ 12.58 on the same page as these ?Is this a double pack ? Then I could understand the BIG price difference !"
2,Way too many peanut butter crackers!!,"I added this to my grocery wishlist as an Amazon recommendation which popped up after I had added something else. I really should've taken a minute to look at the product page, or to realize what would happen before it was too late and someone bought this for me:Nearly HALF THE STUFF IN THIS THING HAS PEANUT BUTTER.To which I am deathly allergic.Peanut allergies are fairly common, so why the hell is half of this thing peanut butter crackers? I can see putting 10 packs of peanut butter crackers in here, maybe 12, but TWENTY?! WHY?!Let this be a warning to people with peanut allergies -- AVOID this product. You'll be stuck with a massive pile of crap you can't eat."
2,"Bland Flavor, Poor Quality","I bought this because I am on a diet and I like to buy things in small packages to control portions. Once I got them and read the nutrition information I discovered that these are very high calorie for their size (around 220 calories). I am going to stick with Ritz Crackerfuls, double the flavor and half the calories (120 calories). The flavor of all of these Austins was bland and boring and there was never enough filling between the crackers or cookies. Most of the packets I opened had crushed pieces which spilled cracker dust all over the place. I tried one of each variety in this package and took the rest to work to give away to co-workers."
4,Great for school lunches!,"These make a inexpensive little snack for kids lunches. There is a good variety of flavors, so you don't get bored with the same one. I have to say this price is a little high though, they are half this price at warehouse clubs, I just bought these for a classroom snack for my 6 year old to take to school today. Even in the grocery stores, Austin brand cracker packs can usually be found for about $1.00 for 8 packs in a baggie on sale."
1,All Crackers Smashed,Every last sleeve of crackers was damaged. The majority of them were smashed so badly that they were just dust. Horrible packaging.
3,Variety Pack,Not bad but not great either. My children of course love the cookies but when it comes to the crackers they just tell me they are extremely dry and pasty. You def. get a lot food for the money but when the children turn to them as the last resort snack when everything else is out... just doesnt make me want to repurchase.
4,Great Bang for Your Buck!,"Excellent assortment, just the right amount of each, lasts a long time! None of the crackers were broken or crushed like some might expect to happen during shipping. My favorites are the round crackers with peanut butter. Great anytime snack or with a sandwich for lunch or sensible dessert."
2,Not memorable,Since I cannot remember the contents of this one even though I know it remains on my shelf tells me that I was not impressed with what I heard.
5,The tale of our home & its history written for all readers.,"This is, and remains, one of the best books I have ever read about the long history of our Earth. Beginning from the brief introduction of the history of geology and the creation of the solar system, to its predicted end, this is a clearly written, beautifully illustrated book.It is clear enough to educate and involve the novice, while sufficiently technical and detailed for the experienced geologist. While now seven years old, much of the contents are still resonant today, and many of the theories presented are borne out today.It's storytelling style and willingness to cover all the details and controversies of an issue, from the Great Dying, to the formation of the moon make this a terrific and interesting read. Combined with the book The Discoverers, you can paint for yourself a wonderful portrait of our world and our civilization. Enjoy."
4,Another Good Read By Ms. Jerott Oh I Mean Ms. Albert!,"This was another good story by Ms Jerott. In it you will meet some old friends from her previous story Absoulute Trouble, and some new friends as well. This is a fast page turning story with witty dialogue, great sexual tension between the main characters, and an interesting topic for the background of the story. Set in one of my all time favorite places New Orleans Louisiana, you will get plenty of discriptive narration that helps set the scenes for the story. Those of you who have read this author before will not be let down, and for those of you who have not yet read a story by Ms Jerott/Albert are in for a treat!"
3,An ok story with a FABULOUS hero...( 3 1/2 stars),"Diana Belmaine is a Private Investigator. Recently a case has fallen into her lap involving some very pricey artifacts that have gone missing. Her first suspect? The oh so sexy Jack Austin. Good Lord...Drool much? The man was hot. Thick wavy dark hair, a strong active bod, and a sharp mind to go along with it. Truly, I was in love with the man. The idea for the book was an interesting one, but it took me too long to read. It was way too easy to put down. If I had to put my finger on what bothered me, Id have to say that it was Diana. She wasnt awful, but she definitely rubbed me the wrong way for some reason. Still, it was an entertaining read and the epilogue was one of the best that I have ever read. This is my second read by Michele Albert. I can safely say that it wont be my last."
4,A great spin on some old favorites,"It's ""Indiana Jones"" meets ""Robin Hood"" with a dash of ""To Catch a Thief"" as a private investigator is hired to recover a priceless Egyptian artifact, and her number one suspect is a dashing archeology professor who specialized in Mayan culture at a local college. While Diana tries to get her man, she has to keep from falling for Jack's overabundant charms, as there is more to him than meets the eye.A sassy heroine, plus a sexy archeologist, plenty of romantic tension, a great plot, the sultry locale of New Orleans, and some really great writing and you have a winning romantic comedy. This is the first novel I have read by Michele Albert; it won't be the last."
1,"Yup, doesn't fit","Bought these for my '09 Prius and found that they don't fit the driver side. (Purchased the rear one as well and it fit with some difficulty.) Tried to save my money, but just wound up wasting it. Not sure if it's Amazon's product finder / matching or the product itself. Back to buying a new Bosch set."
1,FAIL for Honda Accord,"I second the earlier comment that these blades do not work on a Honda Accord (I have a 2006). While the 26"" blade is the correct size, the blade support/guide on the driver's side causes the entire right side of the blade to permanently lift off of the windshield. There is no fix that I'm aware of, other than getting a different brand. In my case, Rain-X Latitude beam wipers, which don't have this issue. I note that the Valeo 600 wipers, which CR loves, also don't work."
2,Disappointed,"I had high hopes for these wiper blades, but within a month of installing the blades they are streaking and rubbing across the windshield. I thoroughly washed the windshield, and applied rain X but they are still horrible. I will be throwing these out and upgrading to a better blade."
1,2006 Accord - does not work,"I have no idea why I didn't bother to read the reviews (I usually do) but this wiper does NOT correctly function on a 2006 (and other compatible year) Honda Accord. I just put it on this morning, and it only ends up wiping about 1/2 of the windshield on the drivers side. It really isn't the fault of the wiper OR the car, as each is designed well, unfortunately, they just weren't designed well for each other."
2,BEWARE...Does not fit 2007 Honda Accord properly.,"I have the same problem installing the driver side wiper on my 2007 Accord as the previous reviewer. As cq08 said, the issue is with the guide located on the car's attachment arm, not on Anco's wiper blade. The guide is used to stabilize the wiper blade and make sure it doesn't wobble when it's in use. Attaching the wiper itself to the car's attachment arm works fine. The guide on the attachment arm is too narrow for the anco wiper to fit, which results in only three quarters of the wiper resting on the windshield. One solution would be to file the guide down so that the blade would fit, but I think I'd rather just stick with a new OEM blade from Honda."
2,Just doesn't fit,"Not necessarily a flaw with the product, more a problem with the Amazon screening of products that fit your vehicle. Have a 2005 Honda Accord - should fit according to Amazon but it doesn't. On the driver side attachment arm are two metal guides. The metal of the wiper blade is too wide and gets stuck on the those guide pieces preventing the wiper blade from bending to conform to the entire windshield."
1,Defective,"The little plastic clip that is supposed to hold the blade arm to the blade separated from the blade as I took it out of the package and I could not reattach it. Upon close inspection, I saw that the clip was bent in two places. I won't purchase this brand again."
4,Beautiful,"I bought this CD for one major reason. It has the song ""My Shepherd Will Supply My Need"" on it. The reason that song is so powerful to me is that I heard the Children's Choir at the National Cathedral sing it on TV on September 14th, 2001 - the day of the national day of prayer and mourning for 9/11. I wanted to find a version of the song on CD and this seemed to be the only one I could find. If you like choral music though the rest of the CD is great."
2,"Ok if you consider it ""disposable""","Never owned a chainsaw, bought one, used it to cut a few trees already, so I feel I got my money's worth, and while not the environmentally good thing to do, will probably toss it.I am glad to see that it is not just me; this is the most finicky gas powered tool I have ever owned (runner up is my Poulan weed trimmer). If you must get one of these, use around home. You can go inside and have a cup of coffee when it won't start. When you return, you might be lucky and have it start. I would not want to haul this into woods - it is not dependable enough for that.Now that I found I like having a chainsaw, I will get myself a good one.(since originally entered, I consider my saw officially dead - won't start at all, and I won't even bother trying to have it serviced)."
4,Wood Cuttin Fool!,"Okay, the reason I bought this little saw is because my old 14"" Poulan finally died after 8 years of trimming and cutting on our Christmas tree farm.So far the new saw is breaking in and almost performing as well as my old dead 14"" prior to breaking down. I have owned Stihl, McCulloch, Homelight, Husqvarna, Echo and a few I don't remember.The Poulan for the money is the best deal out there if you treat it with care. If you are a bit of a ""Caveman"" this is not the saw for you. My old Poulan started and ran flawlessly the entire time I used it and for the original price of $99 bucks that is phenomenal.Although this saw is not of professional grade it is more than sufficient for the average home user. I highly recommend this unit based upon my own personal experience!"
1,Frustrating,"Hard to start. Once started, constantly shuts itself off. Even harder to restart. I admit there were a few afternoons where it kept going, but only when it was running very hot."
2,Does not run good,"I have always used Poulan saws for over 20 years. Now with the new emission standards, the power is not what it used to be and the carbs get blocked up easily and it does not stay running. Time to look for a different brand."
4,ok for occasional use but needs a different chain,"I'm using one that belongs to my sister. So far it starts fine. The problem is that cheap chain that comes with it. It's a skip tooth so you're trying to cut with only 1/2 the normal number of teeth. It gets dull very fast because you're overworking the teeth. I replaced it with an Oregon S52 chain (about $18) that fits perfectly and it greatly increased the cutting capacity. In heavy wood, it will bog down a bit from the small engine, but just back off a little and it cuts just fine.I wouldn't recommend this saw if you heat with wood, but for occasional tree trimming or fireplace wood, it'll do the job."
4,Not perfect ... but not bad for the money.,"I'll give this chainsaw 3-1/2 stars and echo what most others have said; the chainsaw requires a lot of effort to start. It's been this way from day one, but once it warms up, it re-starts easy with a few pulls. I don't think mine has ever started on the first pull even when warmed up. Cuts great. Took down a 20in diameter tree with it and cleared a trail through some dense forest before the chain wore-out (I may have hit a rock and dulled the chain prematurely). Paid $100 at Wally-World for it. It's the 33cc ""WoodShark"" model which I believe is the same as the P3314. If it stops working tomorrow I'd still feel I got my moneys worth. New bar and two new chains are en-route. Keep a sharp chain, the oil tank filled, etc, etc, and it might survive a few years of mild-moderate usage."
1,Hard to Start and Keep Running,"I have had this saw for some 6-to-8 years. Finally, I am throwing it out.It has always been hard to start, and now it has gotten worse. Even when one gets it running it may quit unexpectedly. Then it is even harder to start.When it runs, it is OK."
1,Beware,"I just bought this saw and was very unhappy. The store (Lowes) refuses to take it back (which says something about them also) even though it won't work correctly. It started up just fine, cut really well for the 1st 5 minutes, then started running very poory, as soon as you release the throttle it stalls. There is no good help Poulan gives. this is a brand new unit that was started/used to the letter. So my verdict is you get what you pay for. I would spring for something more expensive that has a good record."
1,Hard to start,I have found this chainsaw hard to start and restart after stalling. Does a great job when it is running. Have other Poulans and they are great.
2,DEFECTIVE GAS CAP,FUEL CAP SWELLED. FUEL WAS REGULAR GAS NOT ETHANOL.I WAS UNABLE TO USE GAS CAP ON SECOND USE OF SAW. THE GAS CAP REQUIRED UNDUE FORCE (PLIERS) TO REMOVE AND COULD NOT BE REINSTALLED.I JUST ORDERED A NEW FUEL CAP ASSEMBLEY FROM [...]I ALSO HAD TO ORDER A SPECIAL TOOL TO BALANCE ADJUSTMENTS TO KEEP IT RUNNING AT IDLE.PURCHASED AT LOWES - NO REPLACEMENT FUEL CAPS AVAILABLE IN MY TOWN.
3,"Poulan 14"" chainsaw","As indicated by another reviewer it is very tempermental to start after it's been run. You can follow their directions to the letter and it won't help. It came with a defective fuel cap O-ring and there is no easy way to get it replaced. The number in the manual goes to a third party who can only sell you parts. You have to go to a service center, in my case a 1 1/2 hour drive. Haven't found a way to talk to Poulan direct."
2,Avoid this chainsaw if you have ethanol fuel!,"Bought this at a national home improvement chain... In our county, all gasoline has ethanol. Some ethanol is eventually absorbed by the plastic in the gas cap and SWELLS the cap, so it cannot easily screw on or off. Poulan's response to this on their website is essentially, ""do not store gasoline containing ethanol in the chain saw; empty the fuel tank between uses."" See: [...] Of course, this is absurd. (Stihl, by the way, had the same issue with their gas caps. Their response was to recall all gas caps and replace them with new caps impervious to ethanol.)"
1,Totally Worthless,After using the saw 3 times for a total of approximately 60 minutes it completely failed. The chain and the drive axel stopped rotating. Smoke and a burning odor came from the engine and the plastic engine housing melted. Prior to the melt-down there was plenty about the product that was unsatisfactory. The engine was difficult to start. The chain seemed to stretch each time I used the saw and adjusting the chain tension was difficut and time consuming. Even removing and installing the gas cap was difficult and time consuming. The threads on the gas cap were misaligned and a pliers was needed to remove and install it.
1,Junk Out of the Box,"Bought this saw after Hurricane Isaac to clear out a fallen tree in my back yard.Started OK and after warming up it kept dying everytime I tried to rev the throttle. Called customer service and they told me that this was no unusual and the carb needed adjusting for our elevation and to bring it ot a service center. OK, really? Right out of the box? Took it back to Lowe's and borrowed a real chain saw from a neighbor. This saw is litrally a piece of junk"
1,Poulan You Will Keep On Pullin,"I did not buy this on Amazon. I bought it from a big retail chain. I used it a couple times. It worked great for small limbs but would bog down going through anything with a larger diamater. I only used it twice and now it will not start or stay started. Avoid, buy Stihl made in USA or Husky made in Sweden."
3,Blackberry cutter,"Hard to start, and the chain comes off too readily, but once you learn to work with it, it takes out brush and 10-ft tall wild blackberry bushes adequately."
4,Decent,"Purchased this locally for a little more than amazon. This thing definitely gets the job done and has enough power for everything i have attempted. Good choice for the weekend warrior. I wish the kit would have included chain bar oil, it does come with two stroke oil and the necessary adjustment tools. I wish the fuel level/tank was visible so you know when it is out of gas."
1,weisted my money,"I get my at the home depot, very difficult to get it to start; only was uses one time, month later try to get it started and the pulling cord get loose, and that was it. It is all roosted now, useless."
4,Poulan 14 in 33 cc gas powered chain saw,Arrived on time. Item was shipped in the same carton that it left themanufactures in. Not such a good idea.
5,This book destroys the pre-tribulation rapture theory,"This book answers all the worn out theories that are put forth by the hyper dispensationalists to get the church off the earth before the tribulation begins. Gundry's book lines up with what Christ and all the Apostles wrote and preached concerning the Second Coming of Christ and the rapture of the church. It is a book that is a ""must read"" for all Christians as we approach the last days. Gundry does not give you what he thinks, but what saith the scriptures. There is no book on the market today that comes as close to the truth about the second coming of Christ and the rapture of the church then Gundrys'. Don't waste your money buying the TV preachers books or tapes, get Gundry's book and then you will be prepared for the last days. Arthur L. Watkins Gulf Coast Bible Society"
4,I challenge pre-tribbers to read this one,"This is not necessarily a step by step study of the post-trib position, but rather a comparison of the pre-trib theory to the post-trib. Out of the 7 or 8 books I've read that are opposed to the pre-trib ""doctrine"", this one shows more holes in the great escape mentality than all of them. A must read for anyone anti-pre-trib. A must must read for anyone holding the pre-trib theory. There won't be much you will be able to argue with if you are a pre-tribber, though history tells us you will. Forgive my bluntness and please give this book a try to make sure you know why you believe as you do. The majority isn't always right. As in some of my other reviews, let me also suggest anything by Robert Van Kampen, H.L. Niger and Marvin Rosenthal."
5,"Completely annihilates the ""pre-Trib"" position.","If you're a Pre-Tribulation ""Secret Rapture"" fanatic, lookout...this book will send you away screaming and ""writhing"" in pain. Gundry delivers the ""hydrogen bomb"" that totally vaporizes the ""Pre-Trib"" position. If you think that Jesus is going to miraculously translate the saints before the Great Tribulation so as to avoid persecution, I'd suggest you read this book. I also liked Gundry's earlier book ""The Church And The Tribulation."" Get them both, read them and then go help stamp out ""Commercial Christianity""- that is the kind that delivers all the sizzle without the steak. Jesus never promised a crown without a cross."
5,Very nice shoes!,"My husband loves these shoes. He has a wide foot and it's very difficult to find loafers he can wear comfortably. The price, color (rust), and fit are excellent. The shoe looks great and required no breaking-in period. Highly recommended."
4,Great looks and good comfort.,"I dont give 5 stars to this shoes because of a comfort issue. They are very comfortable, as any rockport shoes. The problem with this specific model is they make your feet sweat and you can feel it. I use them without socks and it gets a little uncomfortable. Other than that this shoes are awesome. Based on looks I would def. give it 5stars. I have the taupe and my uncle have both the rust and taupe. They are beautiful."
2,Cheap kitchen tool,This was a waste of money and time used trying to get it to work. I do not recommend it to anyone.
3,Steak Thermometer,"I purchased this for a golf outing, this way the steaks would be done as each one liked them. It never worked as it was supposed too. Wouldn't recommend it if you are planning a cook out and want to serve steaks according to the persons likeness. Save your money!"
4,Not For Use With Booster Seat,This product is intended to be used to position a seat belt to fit a child correctly while the child is sitting in the regular seat. It is not intended for use with a booster seat. Reviews based on use with a booster seat are incorrect.
3,velcro catches on sweaters,"Be sure to align the Velcro part of the strap so you don't catch your clothes on it, but it keeps the seat belt off your neck. Can make the belt a little more fiddly to put on but does the trick."
2,It will Rust if you dont dry them!!,"I washed them for the first time and left them to air dry overnight.The next morning, I noticed a little brown rust on the bottom of a few of the knifes. It came off with a little soap and water. But its a pain to make sure thats they are completly dry before putting them away."
2,wallace flatware,"This was supposed to be Wallace Flatware, but the box was International flatware. The silverware was cheap and easy to bend. Not quality I was lead to believe from the web site. Replaced it with J.A. Henckels and very satisfied. It is unusual design."
1,Very cheappy!,"I purchased a wallace flatware service for 8 and i got an international flatware, very cheap and easy to bend. I returned the item!"
1,"Great title, stupid book","This book is so bad that I cannot help wondering if the people who wrote such glowing reviews are freinds and family of the author. This was a total waste of time and money. I only paid $4.99 for the book and that was too much. This is a very immature approach to parenting and life. If you are looking for someting wise and funny, try Erma Bombeck."
3,a light at night for a young student,"I can writter in english on a liitter .I had never red this book .It is my first time to enter Amazon.I work in the field of publish in China .But I think the author adopted a good item, and I want to read this book at the first glance."
2,Skin reaction....,"No complaints on the stool softening effect, it all went well.I took it just to be a bit more regular (one every night) and it worked.However ,in one week of taking it, I noticed a rash like reaction of my face and ears, like an allergy, although no itching. I wonder if it is du to the MagO7, or to something else. I am going to stop it for a while and then try again.I am quiet sceptic about it right now."
4,Very good overview of low-power design above the logic-level,"A very good overview of techniques for power estimation and minimization above the logic level. Unlike a large number of Kluwer books which are re-published PhD theses, this one actually presents a survey of various techniques. I found the chapters on register-transfer level power estimation and power management especially useful.Overall, this book is a great source of information if you are looking for an overview of different techniques to model or minimize power consumption in RTL designs."
5,Ford,"Exactly what I was needing for my boyfriend. I'm giving it as a gift, he's a Ford man and had torn up his other one he had for years. Price is good. I was a little disappointed that when it was shipped, someone folded it in half to fit in the box. It didn't hurt the product but since it's a gift, I wish the cardboard center wasn't all bent up."
4,My husband likes it...,Bought this to replace the last one my husband had on his truck. The installation was easy (F-350) and the wheel cover fits well. He has been happy with it and driving with it for about a month now. I liked that it didn't stink like cheap rubber/plastic when it arrived.
3,It does not fit a 2005 F150 Ford.,The steering wheel cover will not fit a 2005 F150 Ford truck. Not worth the trouble in sending it back.
5,Ford Steering Wheel Cover,"I just put this on my Ranger's steering wheel the other day. It looks cool and feels good. It keeps the steering wheel a bit cooler which is a plus. It makes the steering wheel a bit beefier, but it has a better feel to it so that's fine with me. I'd recommend this to any Ford owner to add a little bit of customization to their interior. Hopefully it lasts."
5,All truck steering wheel covers should be this good.,"Having a 1995 F-150, the material on the steering wheel began to flake off and the steering wheel felt slippery. I purchased this item and after heating in the oven (low temp) placed the cover on the wheel. In the last year or two, it has been great and now I have no problems with slippage. The diamond pattern gives a great feel and control as well as adding dimension to the wheel."
3,Not horrible,Wheel cover is not bad for the money. The stitching on some of the seams is coming undone. Also some of the seams have a sharp point on the material. Its not going to scratch you but could cause discomfort for some. It beat what was on the shelf at the local parts store and matched my blue and black interior and covered my beat up wheel so I cant complain too much.
5,Great Grip and Good Ford Logo Stand out,"I purchased this Ford Steering wheel cover for a Ford F150 and it looks great! It is also easy to wipe down and the rubber feels of good quality.(Tip): My only tip is when installing this Wheel cover as it looked a bit small but it was not, is to leave the wheel cover getting direct sunlight for a few minutes. This helps to install as you will need to stretch it and since it will bend a bit better when its heated by the sun it will save you some time."
1,Dont buy !,Seemed like a quality cover at first . But after 2 months the smelling emitting from this cover was too much . Straight in the trash it went .
5,I can't beleive it,Beleive me this is amazing! This is the best software you could try for internet sharing espicially through a LAN.Try it you won't regret it.
1,Unbelievably bad range,"Don't waste your money on this product.I simply wanted to extend my phone jack upstairs to my DirecTV box less than 20 Feet away. The pair I bought at Best Buy were able to make a link but when you test the sound ""quality"" the noise is so loud you can barely even hear the dial tone. No wonder it didn't work with my Direct TV.Bottom line if you want to ""extend"" your phone jack more than 6 feet I would look elsewhere.Cheers,Tom"
2,No range,"It's a good concept, but they don't work reliably in the same room, let alone in different rooms. From what I have seen that is the case with the technology in general, it's a failure."
1,Did not help me with my TiVo connection,I got this since I thought the one I had was not working and that it would help me get my TiVo started again but unfortunately it did not. I don't know what to do now?
4,Wireless Phone Jack,Great item for homes lacking phone jacks. Easy to set up.Better than trying to hard wire.
3,She has a strong and powerful voice,"Nail scarred hands! The riveting songs, makes you drop your head, when you realize what he went through for my sins!This CD IS POWERFUL!"
4,Different,"As I always do, I enjoyed this Roberts book. The romance and suspense in her novels always keeps me up well past midnight. However, this novel was somewhat different than the previous one's that I've read. Perhaps it was the amount of gory murder, as another review said.I really enjoyed the fact that Roberts could combine three stories into one book. Its like a trilogy wrapped into one novel. I would definantly recommend this to anyone who loves to curl up with an entertaining book."
4,A Great Read! Couldn't put it down,"Since this was the first Nora Roberts book I have read, I want to get my hands on all the rest. I liked this book, because it had just the right amount of romance within the story. Like I said before. A GREAT READ!!!!"
5,The beginning of my addiction to her books,"This was the first book I've read by Nora Roberts. I have been addicted ever since. With over 75 of her books in my collection, I consider her one of the best romance writers of all time. This is an exciting read that makes it impossible for you to put it down. She makes you feel that you are apart of the story. Visit the Big Sky Country by reading this book!"
5,One of Nora Roberts Best!,"Since I've bought this book, I've reread it several times. The plot was eerie and captivating. It kept me guessing until the very end, an end which completely shocked me. The characters are ones that you get to know really well, and in the end, you don't want to part with them. If you're a fan of Nora Roberts or just starting to read her books, this one is truly fantastic!"
4,Loved the suspense,"As always, Nora has a real talent in building characters. The three sisters after not meeting until the death of the father had a real chance to bond due to the stipulation of his will. I am really horrible at remembering names but the strong build up of Will and Tess will put their names in my memory bank. The serial killer part is very suspenseful but his{her}1st person vocalization makes you believe it is one person when in fact you would be all wet. I am not sure how you were led to believe it was this one person all along so I guess I had better just read the book again to make sure. With this particular book, that is no problem since I did enjoy the entire book. Because of being unclear about the killer's character, I cannot give it a 5 star. The details on the killings did not bother me since I have read a lot worse and it just added to the suspense."
5,One of my favorites,I have read this book three times now over the last years. That says a lot when you already know the ending of a whodunnit book.
5,Loved it!,Loved it! But how could you not love a family saga with lots of love and adventure and mystery? Plus the setting was gorgeous. I'm hopping a plane to Montana next chance I get.
5,What a great adventure!,"I was really hesitant to read this book after the more dazzling trilogies I just completed, but this story was amazing. It had everything from family, love, friendship, and great suspense. The twists at the end definitely kept me guessing!"
1,Why so many detailed descriptions of animal torture?,"I usually love Nora Roberts' books, particularly those set in Ireland, but was so disturbed by this one that I had to stop reading it. There are horrifying descriptions of the torture and killing of an old barn cat, a beloved pet, and several descriptions of sadistic torture of cattle, as well detailed descriptions of castrating and dehorning young male cattle. I was so upset by this unnecessary horror that I threw out the book. I am still haunted by these descriptions and the suffering she describes of the poor animals. I hope Nora Roberts will stick to her normal writing and lay off this sort of work in the future. Otherwise, will have to stop reading and recommending her work - these detailed descriptions of animal suffering are sick."
1,"Nora, what were you thinking?!!","Having thoroughly enjoyed half a dozen of Nora's books, I was quite excited to read this one, too. What a disappointment!! Too much profanity (4-letter words show such a lack of imagination) and WAY too many detailed, gory descriptions of the murderer's slashing of animals and characters. First book I've tossed out before finishing in years!! Fortunately, I gave Nora another chance and the next one of hers I read was terrific!! This one is definitely NOT A KEEPER--and quite out of character for a Nora Roberts novel! If there were a choice lower than a 1 star rating, I would have selected that."
4,The Sky is the Limit,"This is a story about 3 women, Willa, Lily and Tess who inherit a Montana Ranch from their deceased father who never laid claim to any of the 3 women. Willa was the only one left on the ranch and assumed she'd inherit until the will was read. In the will Jack Mercy, their father, stated that the only way any of them would get a piece of his pie was if they all lived on the ranch for a year together. They had never met before this day.This is a story of family, love, trust, and murder. Ms Roberts has a way of wrapping your mind around one idea only to have you so convinced and then bam, the story changes. This story has quickly become one of my favorite Nora Roberts independent romantic suspense novels. She is a favorite in general, but his one had me anticipating what would happen next."
1,I was disappointed with this book and didn't complete it,"The violence in this book was a turn off. The animal mutilation was more than I could stomach. I was very disappointed with Ms. Roberts and wondered if she was trying to present herself as a harder-grittier writer.A word of advice, Ms. Roberts? Stick to what you know. I threw the book away -- something I NEVER do!"
4,A good read,"This book had a lot of elements of a historical western romance, however it was set in modern times. I loved the vivid descriptions of the landscape, however the gruesome attacks by the person trying to sabatoge the range were described in way too much detail for me. I was sure I knew who the killer was, only to find out that I guessed wrong!I enjoyed the storyline of 3 half-sisters who have never met before, from very different walks of life, coming together and uniting for the common cause, and finding loving men and supportive relationships. The book was a little too long for me, and dragged along in parts, but all-in-all a good read."
5,My favorite Nora Roberts book!,"This is my favorite Nora Roberts novel. It has all the typical ingredients for a romance novel, but adds in tons of mystery and thrills that keep you guessing until the very end. I've recommmended this book to several people, all who loved it. This is one of those books you can pull off the shelf every once in a while and read again, and the thrills will still get to you! A definite keeper from Nora Roberts."
3,You love it or you hate it I thought it was mediocre,"Three sister who don't know each other and have grown up apart now have to live together for a year to get their inheritance. One sister is dominating, one sister is money hungry, and the other shy and a little shell shocked. A story with great potential but seems to fall short in some areas. Could have been 50 pages less"
2,Not a must read,"This book is not what you should think of when you see the name Nora ROberts. I sugest that if you have never read a Roberts then don't let this be your first. The plot is some what simple and will not capture your atention for long. I sugest you read Sancuary, Homeport, Sweet revenge. If you are looking for somthing out of this world and in my opion one of nora's best then Devine evil is the book for you!"
2,Just A Harlequin Romance Type Novel,"Was this book ever empty. There is absouletly no character development. You have no idea if the sisters like or hate each other. The author REPEATS phrases over and over (yes yes yes we know one of the sisters wears tight jeans, yes yes yes, we know one of the sisters works all the time, yes yes yes we know one of the sisters is timid). That explains about how in-depth you get with this book. It was so boring. I just read it to find out who the murderer was, then when the book finally tells you, I had to go back to the beginning of the book to find out who he even was! A book filled with ""filling"". If anyone gave this book a ten, they must not be very intelligent"
4,Hugh Nora Roberts Fan!!!,"This is the first Nora Roberts book I read. I purchased this book from a book club, picking it from the short caption about the story. I didn't read it for several months but when I did I was hooked on Nora Roberts. Nora Roberts can be very suspensefull writer and at the same time add romance to the mix. I love her books and have purchased and read 15-20 of them. I look forward to all her new releases as they are the best."
4,I saw the movie...,"I haven't read the book, I saw the movie on Lifetime and it was good. But I wish the character were a little more describe. But over all was good..."
1,Montana nor ranchers nor women are like this.,This book is not believable. I was not able to sympathize with the characters. Real men don't cuss like this. The cussing was so prevelant in this book that by page 44 I stopped reading. I lived in Montana and real cowboys have manners and dont talk like this. To add to the disgust was violence that did not need to be detailed to the point Roberts did. The women in this book were either emotionally void or hard as granite. I could not sympathize with a one of them. Save your money and your time and skip this book.
5,Excellent,Nora Roberts at her best. This book should become a mini series. I past it around the office and every one agree's #1 all the way
4,A wonderful not too romantic western fiction,"Having two sisters myself, the relationships between these three brought together struck a known chord. I read eagerly to see how it would all work out. At parts this book was rather sappy as it focused on the three sisters having passionate, kinky sex with their respective men. Overall, the tales of the wild west of Montana and the sisters' adventures had me enthralled until the end"
4,Enjoyable romance that goes beyond the typical chase,"I have read other Robert's books and this one had a great story line, good romance and kept me interested. The one thing that was a little disturbing was the graphic detail of the villain's mutilation escapades. This particular story, however, probably could not have been written without it. It lends credibility to the villain's potential threaten other characters in the story. If you are at all squeamish about blood and guts, I would avoid this one. If you are a tried and true Robert's reader, I would not miss it."
1,Disappointed & grossed out...,"I should have tossed this one out as soon as I hit the first inklings of mayhem & madness. It was a waste of my time & darkened my usually sweet dreams! I have read a number of Ms. Roberts' novels & didn't know she was dabbling in thrillers (quite effectively, unfortunately!). Mixing romance with murder, decapitated animals, & rape is not my idea of a relaxing evening! If you want a sweet romance, don't read this one!"
1,disappointed,"I thought that I was going to get a rich in-depthfamily story that I could sink my teeth into. Instead Ibought a novel that had sex on every other page.The pages that did not have sex, had butchering,butchering of humans, that is. Fine gory details.I would not recommend this book."
5,Awesome AudioBook,"This is an awesome book tape. I would recommend it for adults though because of the language and adult content. It is so suspenseful until the end. It covers it all, romance, action and drama. If you take a long trip then this is the book for you."
1,Bad! Bad! Bad!,"Eww! I read this book because it was recommended in a well-known woman's magazine. Obviously, it was a paid review. Boring, unbelieveable, poor character development, I didn't care about the characters and the story was PREDICTABLE.This is the only book by Norah Roberts I have ever read, and I have no reason to want to read others. If you like to read confession magazines and formulaic romance novels, perhaps you will like Montana Sky too, although it is a step down from the worst romance novel I ever read.I read the entire book...I kept waiting for it to take off.Don't buy this book, don't even waste your time borrowing it from the library. It really is that bad!"
4,MONTANA SKY,Great story!!!! I loved reading about the three sisters! I can't wait for this movie to be on Lifetime! I am hooked on Nora Robert's novels!
3,Just average,"Not one of her best. Concentrated a bit too much on the gory side. But overall still an average read. Her Born In series are much better. (a little sidetrack - finds that Ms Roberts love to write about things in three - 3 sisters/cousins, 3 brothers...etc. Finding this a bit tiresome after a while)."
5,Great Book. Couldn't Put It Down,Montana Sky is a great book. It keeps you on the edge of your seat while showing you how three sisters (who know nothing of each other) can bond and work out differences. Once I started this book I couldn't put it down. Ms. Roberts has done it again. I'm a faithful fan of her's for years and I will always be.
1,Disturbing,"I have always enjoyed Nora Roberts's ability to write a romance novel that has more to it than physical attraction and exaggerated personal conflict. However, this book is one I wish I had not read. The gory details of the murders were nauseating and just plain sick. Our society has a real problem when this kind of perverse sickness can be hailed as entertainment, regardless of what other ingredients are thrown in."
3,Hung in there,I would give this 3.5 stars if the system let me.A number of times whilst reading this book I lost interest and nearly quit. However I am happy I persevered. It was not too bad a read with quite a good line of suspense/mystery.
1,ick....,"DO NOT, I repeat do not buy this book...Its just not worth your time reading it...its not well written, its sexist to the max, violent beyond reason, and just plain dumb...."
3,Different than expected,I bought this to replace one I had that was dropped. When I recieved the new one I read the information about it & was disappointed to read it cound not be used on burners but only in ovens & microwaves. I usually would bake a roast in the oven then remove the roast & make gravy in the same pan on the top of stove. Now I will have to use a second pan. Very disappointing & adds extra work.
3,It looks nice but...,It looks nice but it is made of earthenware and is not like my other CorningWare French White made of pyceram material. It cannot go from freezer to oven to table like the old CorningWare ads said. I will not make the same mistake again.
4,I bought it for My Mother for Christmas.,"She loved it, she wanted a replacement for her old Corningware that had broken. She seems extremely excited to receive it. She hasn't told me if there have been any issues with it, so I'll assume its great! I mean, Its Corningware...what could go wrong!It's quite deep, deeper than any Corningware dishes I ever had, and wide. The lid fits perfect. Its good for deep dish Lasagna and Stuffed shells...and Ill assume casseroles too. probably could cook a small turkey or large meatloaf!"
5,Nice serving and storage dish,I got this covered dish to replace a corning ware casserole I had broken. I am very pleased with it and actually like the oval shape. It's the perfect size for left over stews etc.
4,"larger than expected, but very good",This casserole is amazingly large... so large that you'll likely need to double casserole recipes and make sure that a given recipe doesn't need more shallow heating. Otherwise it is very well made and easy to clean.
2,Good size roaster,"First one arrived with pits in the inside finish, it was replaced quickly and easily at no charge. Replacement came broken in four pieces with no lid, very poor packing. Third replacement arrived intact with lid at no charge, however the inside finish has imperfections. Quality control sucks!!!!""WOULD NOT BUY AGAIN"""
1,Not What I was looking For,"The lid does not fit the Roaster. With the lid so flat it lays on the foord, causing the food to burn. The shape is wrong cannot fit the food to lay evenly."
3,Lid doesn't fit!,"I LOVE Corning and I love this dish. I have had it before and someone ""borrowed"" it so I purchased another. But this one, the lid does not fit well and slides into the dish. I still use it though. I probably just got a defective one. I don't want to waste time returning it."
1,Don't waste your money,I have real corning ware from 40years ago. It still is in perfect shape. I bought this item because it was a useful size. It cracked within four months. I thought perhaps it was a fluke and made the mistake of ordering another. That one cracked in three months. Never again. These made in China pots are total junk.
5,Big & white,This is definitely a big roaster. I haven't used it yet. But will come in handy for the holidays.
4,Its a fuse tester and fuses....,Whats there to review? THe fuses work and the tester works. Job complete. The only grip I have is the light on the tester is only on one side so you cant see it if its facing the other way.
2,Did not like it,If you are looking for a Pocket PC that has GPS this is a good option. In my case I wanted a good GPS Navigation System. I have an old NAVMAN iCN 630 and the graphics are much better. I did not like the fact that you need to open more than one map to get to the place you want (From Hacienda Heights to Encino California). With my old one I never had to do that.
1,What a bad surprise!,"I can't believe that this ugly organ was preferred to the great Aeolian-Skinner in Lincoln Center! God bless Virgil Fox and Ruffatti's who saved the instrument as the core of the giant Hazel Whright organ in Crystal Cathedral, Garden Grove! Catharine crozier is less great than usual on this Kuhn...her playing is full of mistakes. I want to remember her at her best, as in the Delos CDs at S.Francisco Grace Cathedral and at Groton School Chapel! Please...let this Kuhn organ dismantled and place an Austin instead!"
4,Kohn&#65533;s Non-cooperative Stance Against Competition,"Alfie Kohn's competing view to America's sacrosanct blind obsession with competition is well researched and articulated. Although Kohn provides a powerful argument against competition, it is unfortunate that he provides no advice on how this stance can cooperate and thrive peacefully in tandem with the practice of competition..."
2,misses the point,"He is better in interviews than in print. It is more a compilation of others research he uses to back up his premise and as such becomes quite tedious as he gives too many examples to validate his relatively straight forward case.I find little problem with the validity he demonstrates for his ideas, but was terribly dissapointed in his lack of ability to understand the true paradigm shift where people see their own possibilities dramatically expanded by others rather than limited by them, where the ultimate sadness of the destructive nature of competition is higlighted by the amazing things that can happen when people with different ideas get together. ( he mentions the notion that this can happen once as an afterthought in an sentence about cooperation ) The best he can do is champion cooperation, which is laudable, but simply doesn't have enough energy to it to generate much action for change.Dana Johnson"
1,Extremely boring,"I don't know why this books gets 5 stars as a review, because I don't see it that way. She really goes on and on about the details of her life which is annoyingly somewhat irrelevant. I think this is more of an autobiography rather than a ""get rich quick"" book. Most of it is common sense. Obviously there is a difference between needs and wants. This concept has been repeated in other financial books on the shelf. And also about ""comparison"" shopping; that's even more obvious. It's a given that you SHOULD comparison shop before you buy ANYTHING. This book let me down. Lucky I picked it up from the library and didn't actually buy it. Read ""The Millionaire Mind"" for a more pleasant reading in acquiring traits that could lead you to being rich."
5,So Helpful!,"I've just finished reading the new edition of this book, and it has been the most positive experience for finally getting me to realize how badly I was sabotaging my life and my finances. Better than that, thanks to her practical ideas, it became easy to manage my money, start saving, and get my money working for me! Her story is inspirational, and the latest edition of the book includes an up-to-date account of how her methods keep producing profits. Her experiences are REAL, that most people can relate to; she's actually done these things herself, and isn't just yet another financial author telling you what your should do, blah, blah, blah. What makes the book 'excellent' is that her examples and stories, along with being inspirational, are quite funny! As well, she regularly posts her personal finance articles for free on her website, www.smartmakeovers.com, which is a real bonus."
3,Cheap Product,purchased 2 of these for my cars Pacifica and olds. Neither one of them fit even though the box stated they would. They are not even wide enough to go around a regular steering wheel. In my opinion they short cut the material to save money. Keep away from this junk!!
3,Loud loud loud,"This cooler does cool the drive but is very very loud. I didn't use this with a fan controller which is probably why it is so loud but none the less the max rpm's on the fan should be lower. All it needs to do is move the air it doesn't need to be a blow dryer.If you have a special fan controller for it then you should be fine. If you don't and just want to pop it in there, then it will be really loud. Other than that great product."
3,Hard Drive Cooler,The only thing I can say about this product is that its easy to install and its very quiet .
3,Clean Premiere,"A fun album to listen to with the cutz 'I'm here' and 'Whoa' making good dance music. Not a lot of 'Word', but a notch above the secular music."
2,Disappointed,"Maybe, I was expecting too much from P. The production was sharp, but the lyrics lacked the power of the word I was looking for, if you want to just dance and party the tracks can get you there. Being a hip hop head, listening to this and trying to write about it is like trying to compare a Rakim album to a Kanye West album, both good, but for totally different reasons."
3,"Interesting, But Incomplete","This is worth reading (if one can check it out at a library and avoid paying list price, as I did) because it combines one of America's best poets providing limited and opinionated thoughts on one of America's greatest painters. If one is looking for extensive analysis from one, on the other, then this isn't the right book. However, if one is interested in thinking more about Hopper's work with the assistance of a contemporary American thinker then this is more than adequate and will provide a few hours of introspection. I should note, also, that the paintings are fully colored and presented well in this slim volume."
1,Strand Leaves The Reader Stranded,"I found this thin volume inadequate, as it barely mentions some of Hoppers most important themes such as silence, voyeurism, & loneliness. Strand spends approximately two poorly developed paragraphs each on a number of paintings, often providing nothing more than a description peppered with bland geometric terms. Insight is lacking. Additionally, the black and white reproductions are tiny therefore don't serve much of a point. Without quality reproductions of rigorous analysis, this book provides little to either the casual reader or the erudite scholar. In the preface, Strand acknowledges that this volume flies in the face of previous scholars, though he must have meant he was going against quality analysis with support.I would recommend J.A. Ward's American Silences instead."
1,Uncommonly Terrible Mozart. Nothing like described.,"I bought this a year ago, excited to hear Mozart in 5.1 surround. I was expecting a symphony. It sounds like something made on a cheap computer. I couldn't listen past two minutes. I thought it was a joke at first. I guess the joke is on me. I'm sure I own over 1,000 CDs and DVDs, and this is the worst of them all.Wish I could give it ZERO stars."
3,very good sound experience,"I RECOMEND THIS PRODUCT FOR SOUND TESTING ONLY. THIS IS THE BETTER WAY TO HEAR YOUR AMPLIFIER AND SPEAKERS. REALLY IS AMAZING. HOWEVER THE QUALITY OF THE PERFORMER IS VERY POOR. IF YOU ARE A CLASSICAL MUSIC EXPERT, FORGET IT.SORRY, I GIVE THE 3 STARS THINKING ONLY IN THE SOUND."
5,"Not for School, but for Life","This new ""guide for the perplexed"" not only offers a good introduction to succeeding at your study of philosophy, but to succeeding at college. I like that Arthur puts his message in this larger context, and that his advice is applicable, in most places, across the curriculum. (I myself use the book for my philosophy courses!) I agree with Arthur's view that what happens outside the classroom is often much more important in terms of college/educational success than what goes on in the class. The book is well written, not technical, and Arthur's style is interspersed with personal anecdotal comments that add to the delight of reading this book!"
2,Thin and flimsy,The towel is really thin and feels like it will probably only last through one or two washings. It is definitely very lightweight.
1,returned for credit,the bulb would not stay on it flickered & on & off - returned for credit - I don't know if it was defective?
1,not worth a nickle,This light bulb is cheap but it is very expensive for what you get. It fizzled after 2 seconds of half-light. Save your money.
1,DOA,Seems to be a good value if it works. Some people (including me) have gotten DOA bulbs. Depends on your luck I guess.
5,Excellent,This item works really well! It got here in a very fast manner that didn't come by mule train! Thanks for the service!!
3,Lifetime around 1500 hours,"The product works fine, however, don't ever expect the bulb to last around 10,000 hours as they described. Mine died after less than 6 month which gives about 1500 hour lifetime only. 6 x 30days x 8hours/day = 1500 hrs"
1,Very poor bulb life,"Purchased 2 Eiko FML27/65 in July, 2010; each bulb lasted less than 1000 hrs; will request replacements from vendor (Sale Stores)"
1,Eiko 49315 bulb,"It didn't work at all. However, I don't know if it was the bulb or the lamp itself. It was the right size, it did fit, but it just didn't work."
1,Not happy,This bulb is 6 months old and will now not start. It flickers but no light. My last one (original OEM bulb) lasted 6 years.
2,"OK, but...","Although it looks almost identical to a Verilux bulb, it will not fit in either of my Verilux lamps."
1,Very Dim!,"This product is very dim! Even though the specifications were exactly the same as my original bulb...it was very dim. Would be a great night light, but not as a desk lamp."
1,Dead on Arrival,"Being frugal, I chose the $9.95 Eiko over the Verilux at $19.95. It was dead on arrival. Ordered the Verilux and it just arrived and is working fine.Don't waste your time on this one."
4,"Bright light, good quality, ships fast",Got this as a replacement for a Lights of America bulb that last 8 yrs. Eiko looks to be an American Co based in Kansas. I dropped one star in the rating cause the packaging was a little flimsy...need more cardboard to secure the glass parts. Been using it for 6 months and no issues. Light is a bright white would like it to be cooler but it works OK in my desk lamp. Amazon Prime shipping can't be beat!
2,Disappointed!!,"I was disappointed by the picture quality and the fact the only reason I bought this was for the ending song ""Camelot"" which was missing from this VHS tape."
3,A Cliff-note version of a life,"This is a fair but very typical 2 hour made-for-tv movie that really does not do this fine lady justice. She was so much more than just the well spoken arm candy that this movie portrays her as. While Jacquline Smith does a respectable job with the script given I believe that ""A Woman Named Jackie"" came closer to portraying the true character of Jackie."
4,Christmas Heart,Crristmas Heart is an album of original songs which are varied and easy to listen to. The song writer singsmhernown compositions
3,Six books for the price of one,"A young English tourist gets killed on a freight train in the Texas, a CIA undercover agent is trying to kill Osama Bin Laden in Afghanistan, a female sergeant is murdered in London, a gang leader buys drugs from a vagrant in New Orleans, right-wing leaders get killed in the US and a Japanese terrorist is bombing the ... out of Washington D.C. What these six stories have to do with each other? Everything according to the author, but it takes a lot of pages.The book is 579 pages and only after more than 400 pages do all these stories start to converge. This makes the book a real tour the force and some of the story lines are and remain sketchy. The book is well written which makes you read on, but the switching between all the stories is quite tiring and unsatisfying. So all in all a nice book which could have been a very good book if the author would have focussed a little bit more."
5,The best,Verizon is the best in all aspects including customer service but is a bit more costly then some. Not sorry I went with them and would do again.
5,2 for the price of 1,"I could not believe this deal. I usually pay 2X as much for one pack of blades, but this time I saved! Very impressed with this company. It arrived on time and got a very special deal."
2,Okay...but muddled,"In the interest of what accounts for a 'fake' this book offers some good insights and essays. It explores the issues of artist copies, deliberate forgeries, wartime counterfeiting, and historic fakes vs. contemporary. The book gets muddled in its handling of layout and captioning: images are often on separate pages than their captions - and the captions often reference objects that aren't in the pictures. This is maddening when you are trying to visualize the description between the fake and the real object, for most often the real object is not shown for comparison."
4,"So far so good, HOWEVER!","This item, once it finally all arrived to my house in one piece, is a good begginner stand and easily holds my 70 lb bag. My only issue was getting it to my house. I qualified for the free shipping, but they had to ship it 4 different times, the first time it was busted, the second the box was too busted it couldnt be delivered so it was shipped back, the third time it was ""refused"" and by the 4th time i got it ok. Amazon was very good about finding a solution and getting me what I need, however i wonder if they should offer something so heavy if it obviously has problems when it is shipped."
2,wrong item,"I ordered this item showed in the pic with four legs but I end up getting the three support legged one, I decided to keep the wrong item because the seller wasn't very supportive and clueless about the items they have. The only reason I gave a two even thou they sent the wrong item that I was kinda of satified with the one they sent me."
2,very bad quality,This stand is very bad quality. Not worth investing in this stand. The speed bag platform isnt even made out of real wood. It vibrates too much! The Swivel it comes with is made out of plastic! It Sucks! Invest in a better stand like the ones from www.balazsboxing.com
1,Garbage,"This stand deserves a 0, but that wasnt an option. The engineers that designed it were smoking something wicked. It is of poor design and quality. I wouldnt take if they were givin it away. I've had it set up in my basement for a few days and I couldnt wait to take it down and return. Which I did. Pronto. Do yourself a favor. Stay away."
2,A Feeble attempt at redifining the hells,"Another failed attempt at re-writing the hells. First Planescape now this. The devils in this supplement arn't evil creaturs who were outcast from the heavens or some other plane, rather they are presented as the blood-spawn of Azmodeous. Azmodeous is transformed into a god in this supplement with all devils being his ""children"". While the supplement contians some creative elements, for the most part I didn't feel they fit a more classical presentation of Hell. (ala Dante's Inferno, or Paradise Lost). If you're looking for a new twist on Hell then this may be worth a look, however if you prefer a more classical presentation of Hell (like I do) then I recommend reading Dragon Magazine Issues #75 and #76."
5,They work.,Needed 2 of these to connect to a fan the front of my PC case. They work great and connect together and stuff just as you would expect.
2,Not much to it,"Very, very little text. One sheet of cardstock stencils. 5 sheets of thin, colored paper. Not worth any price. But or get a library children's book on Matisse, cut out your own simple stencils, and used construction paper!"
2,Matisse,A little disappointed with this pack. It only included one sheet of stencils and a few sheets of coloured paper.
5,Still being played with after a year!,"My boys, ages 6 and 8, received this set for Christmas 2006. They love it and are STILL playing with it, so I've ordered them the Battlecastle set this Christmas.They have broke a few of the smaller pieces but that is expected for the amount of time they have spent playing with it. The quality is great and the pieces fit together well. We have had no problems with the dragon's joints.Overall, a great set for dragon lovers and anyone wanting their kids to expand their imagination."
2,"Beautiful pieces, terrible product","This is by far one of the worst play sets we own. We bought several of the Dragons Megablocks sets last summer because they were on a huge sale...now I know why! The pieces themselves are actually quite beautiful and the finished product is really cool. HOWEVER, the pieces do not snap together enough to stay put. One nudge and the castle crumbles. The dragons' legs, arms and head also come apart VERY easily. It simply isn't ""Lego."" so, unless they have upgraded the product since last year, heed my advice...buy LEGO! Or, for smaller kids, stick with Imaginext or Playmobile. As much as my child WANTS to play with this toy, it simply leads to frustration."
3,You can find something better,I bought this exercise book for my son. I let him do the test by himself and then we go over it together. He keeps complaining all the answers are next to the questions. (It's just right in front of his face). It's loss challenge for him. I have to buy him another book. We prefer the answer print at the back of the book.
5,A great start to a fine career for this european young lion,I don't know what it is about Storyville records but often they are not only willing to give an artist young or old thier first leader but their production or maybe just the labels name has a magic affect.This is a KILLER CD that shows the classically trained Dahl busting out of the gate like bull.Just get it.It is superior to some of his mid career CD's and as good as more recent efforts.Great tune selection.Along with Jan Lundgren and Niels-Lan Doky Dahl represents the future of European jazz piano.It's in excellent fans.Get it you will be amazed.
5,great music - talented musicians,"I've long been familiar with the Battlefield Band, but had only a few of their pieces. This is an excellent collection."
2,dog grooming,I bought this Griddle Brick to strip my English Cockers Spaniels. I was hoping for a coarser brick but this one is very fine. Takes longer to remove undercoat than a coarser brick which seems difficult to find anymore.
1,Never received item.,Never received this item. Emailed sellerafter 3-4 weeks they said they would sendme out a replacement. I never receivedthat either.
2,A shanty in old shanty town,I am still looking for this song with the complete lyrics. It was made by a female singer (or singers) back in the early fifties. I bought two CD's from you and had to return them because the music did not have the lyrics.Please find it for me.Sonny LongSonny711@141.com
4,Good luck putting this book down,"Once I started reading AKA Doctor, I couldn't put the book down. This book really pulls you in, and keeps you wondering whats ahead for Meg and the Doctor. The author brings you inside the drug biz with him and gives you the chance to see it from his side and what it is really like to live his life in this business.It is a great insider in the drug biz, I found it very interesting.I really enjoyed reading AKA Doctor and I am looking forward to The Doctor's next book. I would defiantly recommendAKA Doctor for all types of book clubs, it would bring up great conversations and keep you guessing. Enjoy AKA Doctor, I did."
5,"Simple, good price, works","Love this thing. I love that this is just a simple mirror that I can mount where I need it and turn freely. There are way too many batteries-not-including, feature-laden baby products out there. Perfect example of a situation where less is more. Well done, Diono. Well done."
4,does a better job than the other options our there,"i couldn't make up my mind about which rearseat mirror to get, so i ordered a few at once to try. this was the winner. we have a jeep, with the rear facing carseat in the center of the backseat, this was the only mirror i could position off the back drivers side passenger headrest and get a good angle to the middle of the backseat where the carseat was. the adjustability is great with it, a much better system than the others had, if they had one at all.minus 1 star because i think the mirror could be slightly larger, or slightly magnified. my eyes aren't that bad off, but you have to look up for a good long second to focus and really get a good look at babies face"
4,Quality item,"I purchased this item and was satisfied with the quality, the ease of installation and I recommend this item to everyone."
1,not safe - CHP agreed,"This is not a safe product. Beware. The mirror is attached to a strap via a 'ball in socket' plastic connector. On day three of owning this product, the mirror fell out of the socket while we were driving. The mirror unit did not properly snap back in to the socket after falling out.Separately, we had run the car thru the CHP (california highway patrol) checkpoint to make sure our baby seat was installed correctly the same week. The CHP reinforced how dangerous the Sunshine Kids Easy View mirror is - we were reminded by the officer that we were lucky it did not injure our infant son when it fell off. We would return it for a refund, but with postage, it nets out the cost of the poor quality product."
5,great mirror!,"great product! i can see my daughter clearly. i have another mirror and its also good, however i get to only see her face. but wit the diono, i get to see everything. nice and sturdy also!"
4,Delivers what we wanted.,"We bought this for our little girl who was just born. We put her in the middle seat and this mirror is attached to the left-rear headrest. It works great and there is not squinting to see her. We bought a mirror for the windshield so we could use it to see her in that mirror; but, can't see her at all with the extra mirror.This one shows her pretty face well with the standard rear-view mirror in our car.Wish there was a combo pack that we could buy because the design of this one is great!"
5,Great Product!,I don't have a head rest in the middle seat of my car and it's been hard finding a mirror that would allow me to see my daughter. This took seconds to install and adjust and now we can see each other when we're driving. Hooray!
5,Really works great!,"Bought this to see my baby in her rear facing car seat. The extra big mirror makes it easy to see all of her and the adjustments allow you to customize the view. Wasn't able to tighten it enough to keep it from moving on the head rest, so I just rolled an extra hand towel and put it between the moveable headrest and the top of the back of the seat. The extra inches was enough to be able to tighten it so it wouldn't move."
5,"Mama, Daddy, & Baby All Love This Mirror!","Love, love, love this mirror! We got it so we could see our baby and tell if she were sleeping or awake. We got so much more. Who knew it would be so enjoyable for our little one? We also have a toy bar in the back seat to keep her entertained, but she hardly even looks at it. She is so mesmerized by this mirror. She likes to watch all the lights reflecting in it at night, and she can see mommy and daddy in the reflection during the day. She also enjoys seeing herself in it. The image is clear, so we have no problems seeing her or even if her eyes are open or shut. The clarity is unmatched as far as I am concerned. I asked daddy about installation, and he said it was easy. I would highly recommend this mirror!"
5,Good Baby Accessory,"I wanted a mirror that rotated in so that I could easily see my baby. I have a GMC Terrain, so the mirrors that attach to the window wouldn't work. This mirror attached easily to the headrest (even though mine don't adjust). It give a clear image with NO distortion! I would recommend this item to other parents!"
3,Doesn't work well with middle of backseat that has no head rest,"Just as the title states, that my main problem with this mirror. It's large enough, sturdy enough. Has decent attachments for head rests, but for those of us that have the carseat in the middle of the backseat without a headrest to attach it to, this has to be rigged some how. The way we rigged it makes it shift from side to side with every turn the car takes and so I often have to lean to look in the mirror to see the baby. Wish there were a better mirror out there for this challenge..."
3,Need to make sure it is secure,"I need to agree with some of the other reviewers it is very important that you keep the mirror firmly fastened to the seat. Make sure that you don't accidently don't bump the mirror and inadvertently loosen in when putting in the car seat.A few points- It takes a little trial-and-error to get the mirror aimed correctly so that it lines up with the baby's face and your rear-view mirror. We have to adjust it whenever we have a new driver in the car.- Remember it is totally useless in the dark. I know that this may seem obvious, but you do need a fair amount of light in order to see the baby.Final Verdict - As long as you keep it fastened tightly - I am not too worried about the mirror being a safety risk. However, it isn't very robust in terms of being able to see the baby clearly for a variety of angles. While it is not a perfect product I am not sure if there is anything better on the market or how it could be substantially improved.3 stars"
3,Not for nonraising headrests,"The attachment for this mirror assumes that you have a rear headrest that raises and lowers. My car does not, so the strap was not long enough and did not attach well. I had to add elastic to the strap and velcro to hold it flush to the headrest so it didn't tip forward. Whether or not it now holds together, as other reviews suggest it may not, remains to be seen."
2,Sunshine Kids Easy-View,Not real crazy about this product. The mirror doesn't stay in place and I am constantly adjusting it. The reflection isn't so good either.
2,Broke easily,"Loved this mirror at first, but then it fell off the base and almost hit our daughter. I have tried many attempts to reconnect it, with no avail. Now I am stuck with a broken mirror!"
5,GREAT MIRROR FOR SUV,I had a problem before with other car mirrors that would only attach to the middle portion of the back seat. With my SUV i didn't have that so this mirror works perfectly. I can actually see my daughter now. And it took me literally 2 mins to attach this one on. Very easy!
3,"Ok for when they're infants, useless with toddlers","I received two of these as a gift. They were really very useful when the babies were little (infants) and I really liked them, though I did have my doubts about their safety because of the possibility of the mirror popping off the ball base. But we used them a lot and found them very helpful. Now that the kids are toddlers, they are pretty useless. The kids are still rear facing, and they kick the mirrors so they are never angled correctly. Furthermore, my son likes to yank the mirror off its base whenever he gets within reach of it. So... I'm now looking to purchase two new mirrors that are flat and don't swivel on a ball base."
3,I like it,"I bought this mirror a few days ago and it seems to okay. I can see my daughter in the mirror, however the mirror is a little curved, so it is kinda hard to see what she is doing. I would not recommend to a friend, though."
4,A vision of comfort,We now have 2 of these mirrors and they make driving so much easier. They allow us to see our child in the rear facing position and not have to worry about what they are doing. We looked all over for this mirror and finally found it. We tried others but none compared to this mirror.
3,Best Loved Melodies by the Lennon Sisters,The songs were not as familiar as I thought they would be and it is so much shorter than the other ones.
4,I found it pretty much interesting,It is something I am looking for plus it gives me idea about how to look for related issues in the FM industry. Thanks to the writer and the publisher too i found them here in Asia and want t deal business with them about writing a similar title and able to share the translation rights in the future for local markets
3,"Good product, bad shipping","I ordered this item as a Christmas gift for my daughter. It was the one 'surprise' I was feeling good about seeing her open on Christmas eve. The item arrived, my daughter was visiting, and she answered the door to receive the package. Imagine our surprise when we both immediately saw that they had shipped the package in its original box. So...unless you were unable to see clearly, there was the radio in its box describing it in full. Surprise - gone. So, I emailed the company, they said they were sorry, and sent me a $5 gift certificate to use. The radio was just what I wanted, but I won't be ordering from them again because of their shipping practice of apparently using the original box (which also doesn't provide much protection against shipping damage)."
5,Wonderful realization of Granados the artist,"Granados' music enjoys nothing like the fame it ought. This album of Granados' own playing reaffirms the importance and vitality of his complex and expressive music. These recordings also highlight the fact that too little has been done with historic recordings from reproducing piano rolls; a properly restored instrument of this vintage (1905 - 1930) can produce tremendously musical results whose accuracy can often be documented(listen to CD's comparison tracks of Granados' Welte recording with his 78 rpm recording). In the absence of modern-quality recordings (or, in the case of Granados, no recordings OTHER than those on these piano rolls), such performances are indispensable in understanding pianists who departed before the advent of high fidelity recordings.I highly recommend this recording."
3,Book has little to offer on Universal Islands of Adventure,"While I found this book to be helpful in choosing a place to stay in Orlando for a trip to the Disney and Universal theme parks, I was very disappointed when, after buying it, I realized that the text of this ""2000 edition"" was actually written BEFORE the Universal Studios Islands of Adventure park opened to the public. So, obviously, the information it offered about the park was minimal at best. ALSO -- if you are an expereienced traveller, you may find the book's lengthy passages about how to book a trip to be unnecessary."
1,OUTDATED!,Don't waste your money. The puzzles in this book are way out of date. For example the puzzle on p.4 asks for the name of the computer in the movie called 2001 which a 7-9 year old isn't likely to have seen. On the same page it says Hee ___ is a funny TV program. On p.6 it asks for Alley___ of comics. There are better books of puzzle out there. Forget this one.
1,Not So Hot,"The first one we got was badly dented. Amazon replaced it with no charge to us. The second one wasn't dented, but the door doesn't close properly. I'm not going to return it, I'll just live with it. My advice: Get it from your local hardware store. It will cost less, and if something is wrong, you won't have the hassle."
4,Good Plain Mailbox.. no frills,"I bought this mailbox on Amazon because it was much less expensive then similar boxes in my town. I wanted a plain white box to pain and to replace our ancient wooden box. This one fit the bill. I read the reviews ahead of time and some where positive and some negative saying it was small, cheap and thin. It is exactly what I expected it to be. An average size plain mailbox. If your not looking for frills and a decent price in a box this is the one for you."
2,Looked nice on the picture,"The mailbox appealed to me because of its rugged look. Unfortunately, its paint was chipped when I took it out of the box. The flap that is supposed to close remains open, despite my adjusting it according to instructions. A waste of money."
5,Great mailbox,Great mailbox. Alot darker in color than the picture shows. Looks brown but i like the color alot better.
4,seems a decent mailbox,"The mailbox seems like it is a decent quality, but we will not be using it as such. We got it for our wedding and plan on using it as the card holder. The flap was a little stiff and hard to open but I'm sure a little WD-40 would help. As other reviewers stated the actual color is more of a brown than the light bronze depicted, but that is the color we wanted so we are quite pleased."
3,"Color completely inaccurate, otherwise pretty nice box","If I was strictly rating functionality and construction, I wouldn't have any problems. However, I gave it three stars because I specifically wanted a ""BRONZE"" mailbox. The box in the picture looks bronze and is exactly what I wanted. The actual box, however, is dark brown. As I commented on another user's review of this box (who had problems with color inaccuracy also), the color couldn't be any further from bronze and is very clearly, in all lighting, dark brown (close to black). Color is something that was very important to me and although the brown box doesn't look bad at all, it's not what I wanted nor what I purchased.The box this came in is labeled ""Bronze"" and Amazon does not even sell a ""brown"" version. Judging by my experience and at least on other person's, do not trust the demonstration pictures. Count on the color being far from the color you think you'll be getting!!!"
1,Bad Choice,"I do not recommend this box. It doesn't close and the mail gets wet. If this was just my box, I wouldn't say anything and get a refund; however, other people have told me that their experience is the same thing. It is an expensive lesson to learn. Do not purchase this box."
2,"Nice mailbox, but the paint was already chipped","Very good quality of the mail box itself, however the paint was already chipping around the handle and had a large white scuff on the top, it was too late to return it"
4,Mailbox,Item has been great although it is a little tough to open and shut. It needs to be forced to close and open. Looks like it gets better with time. Overall a great product.
4,"Considering the subject matter, it was an easy read","I've learned so much from Tears of the Cheetah. While the subject is rather deep; (scientific), it was well written and easy to read.Dr. O'Brian was able to blend history, science and personal experience into a well-written book.-TJ"
5,Tears of the Cheetah,"I liked this book because I am a lover of animals and I like to read further into them. I especially love cheetahs and in the genetic world, cheetahs are a prime example of a species that genetics can be traced and studied because they were almost wiped out."
3,I like this book a lot,"It's nicely written, contains interesting genetic facts about the animal kingdom I never would've known.(cheetahs were so badly inbred plus the genetic distance of african lions to asian lions)."
1,Tear's of a Cheetah,"Better to have been titled, ""The Memoirs of a Civil Servant"", this book is bloated with a self congratualatory stain that you just can't get off the page. O'Brien conducted the globtrotting refered to in this book on the $$$$$ of the National Cancer Institute. So where is the cure for cancer ? Certainly not slipped in among the pages about the chetah's and the pandas. Science is a very expensive business and this book simply portrays an ego in pursuit of a special interest and personal fame; a theif in the night who occassionally throws the readers a few crumbs of connection to imply relevance to the larger picture real medical science. Shameful. You can truly serve any evolutionary or genetics curiosity by reading and enjoying the great but humble works of Stephen J. Gould"
3,"Worth a listen, or a purchase for Queen fans","Freddie's solo album doesn't rate with the best of Queen, particularly in the arrangements, which sound overly synthesized and under-powered. And whatever your opinion of Roger Taylor's drumming, it's far better than the tinny, cringe-worthy drum machine in evidence here. However, Freddie was always the band's most consistently compelling songwriter, and he doesn't disappoint. ""Love Me Like There's No Tomorrow"" and ""There Must Be More to Life than This"" are as simple and affecting as anything from Queen's glory years, and ""I Was Born To Love You"" captures some of the infectiousness of Freddie's ""Rhapsodic"" heyday. This is a disc worth having, but I can't help but wonder what the hyper-powered musicianship of the rest of Queen could have done to augment these tunes."
4,Currently going for $154!!!,"I just found this in pretty good condition for $11.99. I bought it because I like Queen and Freddie and realized I'd never seen it on CD before. WOW is it in high demand based on the Amazon Marketplace prices; I'm thrilled I got it at a normal price.It's a very good CD, sometimes over the top as we expect and love from Mercury. Queen was still doing well on the charts circa 1984-1985, and this record fits in nicely with what the group was up to at the time (""Radio Ga Ga"", ""I Want To Break Free"").The (minor) chart hit was ""I Was Born To Love You"", and it deserved better. A remix of ""Living on My Own"" became a big UK hit a couple of years later. But all the songs are good. Whether they are $154 good is a tougher call. I'd have to say wait for another reissue, and for now get ""Lover of Life, Singer of Songs"", available from Freddie at a non-fiscal cliff price."
3,that's ok for the price,"The sound queality depends on what bud u use..it's bad for working out, even walking the earphone gets out of the ear. i tried with a different bud for at least 2 days, and the conclusion was: the bigger buds is the better to avoid any sound, but gets out of the ear, the medium... not too good sound and for me is unconfortable.While u're using it.... it's very light, u dont notice u are wearing the earphones =) that's nicefinal recomendation... spend a few $ and buy a better one."
3,They're Decent,"The only other ear phones I've had were the ones that came with my ipod, and those were the worst. So in comparison the skull candy ink'd are better, but like many of others have mentioned they have that horrible stethoscope attribute where if anything touches the wire you hear it loud and clear. So I would say they're worth it if you pay $11 like i did but otherwise look on."
1,Sound is Horrible.,"After purchasing these earbuds from Toys ""R"" Us, I was excited. I had heard that they were best cheap ear buds. I got home, plugged them in my iPod, and was disappointed. The sound was tinny, and it sounded horrible. Do not buy these. Waste of cash."
2,Perfect cheap earbuds while they last,"The Good:I kept buying these earbuds because they are cheap, comfortable and offer acceptable sound quality. If a cat chewed through the chord, it was no big deal. I considered them disposable. But I also liked the lack of crazy gimmicks such as behind the ear fit, or strangle-the-back-of-my-neck asymmetric earbuds. The fit, feel, and sound is good for the price.The Bad:One side eventually starts fading in and out and eventually stops working completely. I've purchased almost 10 of these, and the same thing always happens -- usually within 2 or 3 months. I wonder how they get them to fail so consistently.The Verdict:If you consider these to be cheap ""disposable"" headphones, they're great. And cheap. Personally, I'm moved on to other brands with bigger prices; Earbuds that might have a more reasonable lifespan, and better sound to boot."
2,"Cheap price, cheap product","After using these ear buds almost strictly at my desk at work for the last month or so the left bud has shorted out. It buzzes and has lost half of it's volume. The sound is terrible with little to no bass and very poor higher end sounds. You get 3 different sized rubber fittings for the bud to adjust to your specific ear size. If you pick too small, the sound is worse than normal poor sound quality and if you pick too large, your ear gets sweaty and may start to hurt. The only plus to these ear buds is that they have the potential to be comfortable with the correct sizing. They were $15 when I purchased them so I expected little, but got even less. This is my 4th or 5th pair of head phones in the last few years and are by far the worst. Others that I purchased well before this set are still around and working well."
1,SUCK!,"These are ok headphones, until about 10 weeks later when they stop working. I should have never sold my apple earbuds, which even though they weren't the best sounding, they last FOREVER. I only had one pair quit on me when they got caught in my bike chain. But don't get these, or really anything from Skullcandy, they are a very low quality company!"
1,"Sound Aweful, and Unconfortable!","I bought a pair of ""Skullcandy Smoking Buds Ink'd Earbuds - Black (SC-INK'D/BLK)"" at Target today for $13.99, and I thought they were complete cr*p. They were unconfortable and the sound quailty was aweful! When I first put them on, they felt like I was sticking in earplugs not headphones, and then worse of all was the really tinny yucky sound quality. At first I tryed to adjust the way they were in my ear bc I thought it was inpossible for them to sound this bad and be this unconfortable, but the more I adjusted them the worse they felt. It sucks that now I have to jump back in my car and waste my valuable time to return these darn things. I would say the stock headphones that come with an i-pod sound 10x better, I wish I didnt loose mine!"
2,SkullCandy?,The only time I can get them to stay put is when these things are burrowed 3 inches in my ear. Maybe it is my ears that should get two stars...
5,Small Ears?,I purchased these because of the small ear buds. I have small ear canals and most ear buds hurt my ears after I wear them for a few mins. These are very comfy and I'm so glad I purchased them. I'm looking forward to using them for a long time.
3,"Fine, for the price","Bass respones is very poor. Equalizer must be jacked up for sound to be very rich at all. But for $12 bucks at Target, it could be a lot worse. (I paid 12 in store for them). For 7 or 8 bucks more you can get even better ones from Sony, so if these are just ""back up headphones"" like they are for me, you're fine. If you want pretty cheap headphones that work a little better shell out just a little more and things can be better."
4,Better than the SC-SBB3.5,"I owned the SC-SBB3.5 first and so far the 'Ink'd' are a better pair. The sound on both are great but I find the fit on the Ink'd to be better(both pair came with 3 sizes of rubber adapters). The sc-sbb3.5's fell apart in less than a year, so we will see if these hold up any better. The only difference I can find between the two is the sc-sbb3.5 has a volume control on the chord(which I never used because they never fit well enough to run or ride with) and comes with a little plastic holder(also never used). Better fit, equal sound and a smaller price, you can't really beat that.Holler"
4,no more tangles!,"Yeah, the sound wasn't that great, but what I liked best about these buds is the cord. It's coated in what feels like rubber rather than plastic which has a tendency to tangle easily.I have a tendency to wrap the cord around my iPod so when I unwrap them, they come out straight (or at least untangled). What I also like is the standard feature on Skullcandy ear buds is the retainer ring you can push up to hold the earpieces together when wrapped.The silicone does have a tendency to stick, but that's usually due to sweat and/or skin oil residue which can be washed off with warm water."
3,Won't last forever,"Firstly i must say that these earphones are great, bass is amazing on these things. My biggest problem with them is that they don't last very long. I usually have to buy another pair every three months or so, but keep in mind they're cheap. All in all, they're great for the price but trust me, they will break on you."
4,Not bad at all...very nice for the price,"I picked these up for about $14 and for the price they sound great. After tweaking the EQ they have a nice and bright sound with good bottom end. I had a pair of Shure E3c earphones but stepped on one and broke it. I'm going to replace them but until I do these will work great. The cable on these seems to be a little thicker and they don't have the two different length cords for the drivers, a plus to me. If your looking for something under $20 then these will fit the bill. I would definitely recommend them."
3,Better Than Stock,"If you are still using the earbuds that came with your mp3 player than these will be an upgrade. I'm not a crazy audiophile but I can tell the difference between headsets enough to care. The bass is made to be stronger than normal earbuds, the sound quality is better than average but not top of the line. The bass at times can overpower everything else. If you like bass and need a little noise isolation these will be for you."
2,"Nice at first, but fell short","When I first got these, they fit perfectly, isolated noise almost completely, and had great sound quality.Unfortunately, a few weeks later they started shorting out and stopped working.I guess for $10, I could replace them every month, but I'd rather not."
4,These are great for short term use.,"They work really well and look kind of cool, but they really can't handle the stress of being used a little roughly."
5,Very good for the price,These are the first in ear buds that I have owned and the comfort was surprising. I wore these on a 5 hour flight to Phoenix and they didn't really bother me until almost the end which is more than I can say for my old Zune earphones.I would recommended and In fact bough a second pair because they do seem like they can break easily but for the price I could afford it.
4,"Outstanding bass, VFM","I bought this earphone after reading the reviews on this site. These earphones are lightweight and fits snug in my ear with the standard rubber buds it came with. I use it to listen to music on my iPhone and the bass it produces is outstanding. The punchy deep beats it produced while playing Confessions (by Usher) is the reason I decided to write this review in the first place. I have Shure SCL2 earphones and they cost $100 and don't come with this bass.The reason I give it one star short is because sometimes, it does sound tinny. I can't complain with the price it comes for though.Warning: These can get really loud! So keep those volume levels low:)"
4,Perfect for some. OhKay for some,"2 kinds of listeners.1 - don't care what the source is, as long as music sounds awesome.2 - care about ever single little thing. picky as heck.I'm 1.cheap earbuds. cheap material.however, the quality of bass and music that flows from this pair...my goodness... can beat some of those Sony headphones out there.the bass brings joy to my ears at the moment! (11mm speakers)I recommend these for people who wouldn't mind buying like 5 pairsat once for longevity. these don't last that long, hence the price.some people say you get what you pay for. these are somewhatcontradictory of that statement.you don't normally get 11mm earbuds for 10 bucks...you do get the cheap physical material quality,but the audio quality you get from these buds...is... like you paid like good 70 dollars.. hahablocks out noise fairly well.not recommended for work-outs and jogging.recommended for students at school. or at office.hope this helped."
3,Good for the price,"These earbuds are inexpensive, comfortable, have good enough sound quality, and I'm pleased that they've at least lasted for the 2.5 months I've owned them.The problem I have is that they make a very loud and annoying noise when the cord rubs against your clothes - to the point where these are basically unusable for anything other than sitting down.I would recommend these to anyone looking for inexpensive earbuds that plans on using them for stationary purposes. If you want earbuds for walking, running, or anything where you're moving, I'd look elsewhere."
2,Not what I expected,"They are comfy, yes. But they do not stay in my ears. They keep popping out and it is very annoying."
2,Mediocre Sound,"I thought these looked great in the packaging and I read some good reviews. But having tried everything from Sony, to Sennheiser to even just the regular white apple ones that come with the ipod, I have to say that these were my least favorite. My biggest problems with them are 1) the sound is not clear and sounds kind of muffled, 2) the buds aren't very good quality and though they block out noise, they also feel like they are 'suctioning' my ear regardless of size - and I never had this problem with other ear buds, and lastly 3) the quality is rather cheap - the cords are stiff, etc (I know, probably minor to most people). I think for the price of these, you can probably there are better quality ones out there."
4,"Love the fit and sound, hate the plug","Having burned through the OEM ear buds and The Source replacements - both failed at the plug - I decided to go with Skullcandy. The player itself cost me $60 so the Ink'd earbuds at $24 were nearly half as much as the player. Luckily they were on sale - know I know why.The fit was absolutely perfect for my ear. The sound was very good - certainly better than the previous two sets I had used. I mostly listen to audio books while walking to work but they also handled everything from folk metal to alternative with no major issues especially not in the bass department. Then the plug failed without warning after only a couple of months.I am sending them back for replacement so we'll see what happens there. If the replacements fail, it will be time to break out the soldering iron and put my own plug on."
4,skull candy ear phones,"Skull candy ear phones aren't as good as they used to be. The wires use to be thicker and last longer even with daily use. Now, for my teen age son, a pair only lasts 3 months max."
2,"Break easily, LOUD wire noise","I used to love these. I am on my third pair, the first one I broke, I got them wet, so it wasn't the company's fault. I replaced them, and they broke, quickly. I thought it might have been a fluke, so I bought another pair. Again, the same thing. I am not athletic, or even terribly active. I listen mostly lying in bed, or while I am sitting at work. There's nothing that should make these things break so easily, but once again, all the sudden they don't work! The cord is flimsy, so if you do anything besides leave it hang completely undisturbed, the buds will quit working in short order. During the month or so that they DO work, you had better stay very still while listening, because the slightest movement will be heard through the earbuds, and it's not slight, it's louder than the music itself! These things are proof, you get what you pay for. DON'T BUY THEM!"
5,Great buds for sansa c250,I have a sansa c250 and these buds sound great. They are much better than the set that came with it. For 15 bucks I cant complain.
2,Decent comfort but poor sound quality,"Although these earbuds are comfortable enough, they provide tinny sound quality AND make clicking and scraping noises every time you touch the line that connects the iPod to the earbuds. I'm happier with my less comfortable, but much better sounding, original equipment iPod earbuds which have better sound quality (particularly in the low end) and don't make the evil clicking and scraping noises. My advice: save your money and buy something else. I'm still looking for reasonably priced earbuds that have good sound quality and are form-fitting to my ears."
1,Fail!!!,"I got a pair for xmas, I was very disappointed, no bass and the sound was very tinty. If you want sound qaulity go with Skull candy's Smokin buds. for the money nothing compares."
2,Horrible sound,"I just bought these headphones and wish I hadn't. While they're very cheap and probably will do for the time being, I could have gotten earbuds that sound much better for the same price. Everything sounds tinny and the middle range is way too high over the low end. I'm using them with a bluetooth dongle paired with my phone/mp3 player and the earbuds that came with the dongle sound much better than the Skullcandy set.I bought them on short notice to replace a pair of Sony earbuds that developed a short in the left ear and these will be used almost exclusively while running. The two pluses I can think of are that 1) I usually only listen to podcasts so the shortcomings shouldn't be so obvious while listening to those, and 2) I've had headphones succumb to sweat before and I'm just glad these were so cheap so I won't feel bad when they do the same thing as soon as possible."
1,Horrible design and poor manufacturing,"These earphones are not well-made and sound comes in and out after about 1 month of use. Plus, the design, while it blocks out surrounding noise, was not at all comfortable for my ear. Take it from me--just buy a good set instead of dropping $10 on these cuz, like me, you'll end up buying that good pair in the long run anyway."
2,Get What You Pay For,"I've had these headphones for a couple months and use them most days of the week. I had been using the Apple iPod earbuds, until those broke, and also Sony h.ead lightweight earphones. I bought the Ink'd because I have gone through 4 pairs of Sonys, all with the same problem of the left ear dying, and figured I'd try another company. The difference in sound was astounding. The Ink'D's sound is incredibly tinny compared to Apple or Sony (and neither of these were any more expensive than Ink'D). Also, they let much more sound through. I find myself constantly turning up the volume to a point that I'd never hit before just to drown out the sounds of machinery at the gym. I've been trying to return these to the company, but they'll only offer a replacement. I really wouldn't recommend this product to anyone. Buy some Sony's, they're much better."
1,Poor workmanship,I bought these to replace the standard Ipod earbuds. The sound was ok. I'm not an audiophile or anything so for me they worked. Unfortunately after maybe two months the right bud just came apart where the gray meets the black. I was so disappointed.
3,Love the design dissapointed in the sound,I love the desing and the shape they are perfect however when you shop for earphones I guess the most important thing is... yeah THE SOUND QUALITY! Duh! ... I was a little dissapointed because the bass has like a crushed paper echo in the background passed a certain volume and trust me is not loud.
2,Eww.,"These are (now were) my first Skullcandys. I have to say, they sounded bad, gave me blisters in my hears, and died in a month of light use. Pass on these."
4,Great sounds quality for the price,"If you are like me and you wear through headsets really fast then you will like the skullcandy INK'D. They are more durable than any other I've been able to find at this price and still have good sound quality. If you are willing to spend a little more and want better sound quality and aren't as rough on headsets (I usually manage to go through at least 5 a year if not more) go for the Full metal Jacket Skull candy; they are just a little more substantial and have great sound quality. These is one of my favorite headsets, but I am still waiting for them to come out with a headset that does not have a removable earpiece (they are very comfortable but they fall off and I can wear them at work in case they fall off and fall in the food I work with)."
5,Best for the price,"I bought them for $35 a year and a half ago and I was really surprised by the sound quality, but recently they stoped working after so much abuse :) I can now confidently say money well spent :) I listen only to high quality music something in lossless or dual channel 320 kbps mp3's or AAC+ formats. These have really good bass response it does not overpower mids yet fills the music with warm and rich bass, mids could be more clearer but I would expect it only from higher end buds. Highs are crisp and clear. The fit is good after you get used to them. Now I have Maximo iM 590's which have better sound but they cost more also. These are good for those who don't want to spend a lot on buds yet want a decent sound. Compared to V-moda Bass Freq's they are much better and have much clear sound. If you like bass which is powerful enough and fills you music then look no further."
5,The seal does it!,"Every ear bud pair that i have owned has never had great sound quality. This pair, is the best i have ever heard do to the fact that there is a little rubber part that makes a seal with your earwax, so you don't hear whats going on outside! I recommend them!"
2,Dissapointed,"Well, you get what you pay for, I guess. I had heard good things about Skullcandy, and since the prices was right (at our local Target), I thought 'why not'. Well, I must say, they are not worth the $11.99. I will agree with other reviewers that these are very good fitting earbuds, and that really do a good job at isolating you from exterior sound, but the sound produced by the buds themselves was very disappointing. I find them sorely lacking in production of both highs and lows. Mid-range is very good, but that's it. Now, before anyone goes off about how you need to have earbuds seated properly to get good base response, I can assure you, as I have been using earbuds for 10+ years, that I know how to wear them. With that said, these these rank at the bottom of the ones I have owned and tried. I would have rated these one star, but they are very good at isolating sound, just not so good at reproducing it."
5,Best in its class,"These earphones are truly the best in its class. These earphones have a stunning appearance. They fit perfectly inside your ear. They also come with three different sets of pads (the clear, squishy piece on the end) to adjust to your ears. The sound quality is incredible. Also, the cord is really long (more than twice as long as the earphones that come with the ipods). These ear phones are truly amazing.Everybody always complains about the loud ""thump"" the cord makes when you rub against it. This isn't really a problem; It barely does it to me.Anybody looking for top of the line headphones for a cheap price, you've found the right ones."
4,Excellent Cheap Earbuds,"I like to have a set of earbuds for everything. I have a HD280 Pro monitor set, a set of cx-300's and a set of Shure SE110's. Each one has its advantages, but I wanted a cheap pair of buds that I wouldn't need to worry about for frequent traveling. I got these in my campus bookstore and have to say they have some of the most balanced and clear sound of *any* of my sets. They are a great accompaniment to my shuffle and are more comfortable than my other options. I recommend these as a nice blend between cost, comfort, and sound.Pros-CheapComfortableAdjustableExcellent sound responseCons-Not good for exercise (cord jiggle is heard through earbuds)"
3,Handy but disposable,"I love Skullcandy their products are amazing, but I've gone through 2 sets of these headphones in six months! I travel home from work for two and a half hours everyday via train, subway, bus, and boat and these suckers block out even the loudest crazy homeless guy but, they burnout so fast. I've tried everything to keep my second pair from dieing(I don't blast them at full volume, I keep the cord untangled and I don't bend the wire at the jack, plus a few other little things) with little success (they finally cracked today). I've decided to give Skullcandy one more chance with their ""hesh"" headphones hopefully they'll last me as long as they have for my friends."
4,great!!,"good headophones [and cheap! on sale at FYE, fow now]. i've bought multiple pairs of headphones for my ipod and they never last very long. i've gotten $30 replacement ipod ones and $15 coby ones but they all fall apart in the ened. but this one has, so far endured, and i hope it continues to do so. because i don't think i can afford to keep shoveling out money for headphones."
1,Amazingly bad sound,"I just picked up a pair of these at a local store and I was amazed at how bad they sound. I didn't think anyone would actually manufacture a product this bad and put their company name on it! When compared to a very cheap free set I dug out of a bowl when I went to a computer related technical event, these really sounded horrible. The sound is all high pitched and screechy with nearly no mids and the base was just non-existent. On the positive side at least they were the more comfortable of the two... These are going back though."
2,Good for $10 but not on par with shure and v-moda,"I bought these for 10 bucks (like everyone else) to use as a second pair at work so I didn't have to unplug my iPod and plug it into my computer 10 times a day. They are very OK but extremely high on the treble. If you want any sort of small bass recognition at all, these are not for you. My other pair is the v-moda vibes and they work really well for me. These skullcandys are great but don't be thinking your scoring a $100+ set for 10 bucks like the other reviews might lead you to think. These are good for the price but if you like to hear all your musical instruments, invest in a better pair."
2,"Looks good, feels good, sounds terrible.","The iPod buds sound decent to me, though I've got a real problem with them staying in if I do anything besides sitting still. If I keep them in my ears for a while they begin to hurt as well. So, I decided to get a set of buds that would stay in the ear with some comfort. Mission accomplished. These Skullcandy Smokin Buds fit in the ear nicely and don't hurt after using them for a period of time. Unfortunately, they sound terrible. I'm no audiophile, but I can tell a complete lack of bass when I hear it. I expected more, but they're $15."
1,disappointing,"I should have noticed these were cover versions but sometimes they can be good although sadly not in this case, waste of money."
4,Very pretty soft light.,"These are very soft lighting, so you need a few of them if they are your only source of light. But very pretty soft lighting effect for the patio."
2,"Um, Nice Photo!","These lights were super cheap so no complaints there, BUT the photo makes them look magical and amazing. Reality is that this is a short cheap strand of white christmas tree lights with woven balls of twine loosely fitted over the christmas lights as if by accident..."
1,OVER PRICED,"Love the way Rattan lights/items look but I nearly purchased these when I took one last search online for cheaper similar item, so glad I did. You can get these identical lights for 12.99 at Lowes or their online store...why pay nearly triple here?"
5,C22 / Cable to Go 27391 4in 3- pin Fan Power Y-Cable,Thank you. It's great it's easy to install I just plug in the two fan of my PC the runs okay.
3,Good book until the characters are on different continents,"This book was the first I've read by Susan Johnson, and I was enraptured for the first 3/4 of the book. Then inexplicably (okay, it was explained in the book but not to my satisfaction) our heroine travels to France (from Montana!), where she remains separated from our hero for about a year. Obviously, little romance can occur when the people involved are living on separate continents! This book was headed for 5 stars, but gets only 3 due to this plot contrivance (and others that I won't mention because they'll spoil it)."
4,HOT PAGE TURNER,"To put it simply, this is one very romantic book. I love the character's and how they develop. The only thing I really didn't care for was the heroine going back to Paris, and it taking the hero a year to realize he really loved her and needed to go and find her. Such as life, being too stubborn to realize what's good for. I recommend this book highly, and will continue to add to my SJ collection."
1,Horrible,"This is one of the worst books I have ever read. When I found myself laughing in places I was supposed to take seriously I knew it was time to throw this book in the nearest dumpster. It did do one thing for me, I must confess. It inspired me to write. Because if Ms. Johnson calls herself a writer then anybody can be a writer. Including me."
4,"Good, but could be better","Here is another CD at the Crystal Cathedral by Fred Swann, this time actual works written for organ. This is a decent program, and the booklet gives a brief history on the organ as it was then. Dr. Swann does very well with each piece, however there are a couple of issues. First of all there are a couple of times where the editing is clearly heard. Its almost as if they combined a bunch of takes during the sessions to get the final result. That was a little disappointing...especially during the Wright piece in which there is a pause, and before the echo dies away you can hear the organ pick up again. Second there are birds singing in one of the tracks (this was clearly explained in the liner notes). But overall this is a good disc amd is worth getting."
3,Not as good as it should be for the price,I bought the most expensive device of this type figuring it'd be the best quality. It worked wonderfully-while it worked. It wore out in about 8 months :-(
1,Quit after 2 weeks,The product worked great at first until the satellite started complaining about not being able to dial out. It was correct and nothing outside of being 3ft from the base produced a dial tone (even 6ft away didn't).
1,Wireless Jack,Worked fine for a couple of months and then quit all together. Previously used an RCA model which also only lasted a short while. I had them hooked to a satellite receiver.
2,WFireless Jack System is a rip off,I received my wireless jack system today. It was covered with paint! Plus ione of the items looked burned out! What a cheat! All I want to do is get rid of this piece of junk.Judith Hollanlder
4,"don't use it for internet, don't think it's a magic",It helped me to avoid having to drill walls and draw a long cable. But I got some noice in the line and definitely wouldn't use it even for a dialup internet.
2,Extremely poor performer for me,"Once connected, this unit resulted in so much static on the line, that my Tivo could not successfully make its nightly call to download new guide information.After lots of testing, I found that the unit simply would not work unless it was within about 10-15 feet of the base unit. An amazingly short distance for a device such as this.I then headed down to the best buy and picked up the RCA version of this device and it has worked flawlessly. An interesting note here - both devices appear to be identical as far as their guts are concerned. In fact, the instructions for both items were identical - the exact same words used on every page.I am not sure why there was such a difference in performance (perhaps I just got one that was off a bit), but I would suggest you think twice on this item. I was able to return it but had to pay all shipping costs - something you don't have to do if you need to return it to the local store."
3,Slow but convenient,"I bought the Phonex under the Belkin name brand for my parent's computer. The speed usually connects at 34-36 kbps. Which for my taste is slow, but for email and simple web browsing is probably acceptable. I don't know if the wiring makes much of a difference, but their home is at least 15 years old.Installation was easy. I had it up and working in minutes.Had a interesting problem when my son accidentally reset the code on the base unit. I couldn't figure out why it wouldn't work. (Of course I didn't have the manual anymore) Belkin's website was no help. Phonex says reset without any instruction. RCA's website was more helpful. If you are getting interference, you may want to reset both units, first the base, then the extension. Do this by pressing the little recessed button on the side with a pen/pencil."
4,Pretty much does the job.,"This device is not perfect. You can't get a perfect dial tone in every situation. But you can alter the envirement and make it flawless.What I've found is that if there is any power hunger device nearby - computer, lamp, tv, etc - it distorts the signal. However, you only need to worry about proximity to electronics with the reciever, not the base.Here's my setup: I got Voice over IP, so my phone line goes through my router. I have the base station in my room, and my VoIP phone line goes into the base station. The reciever is in the basement, attached to a power line that comes directly off the circuit breaker so it gets a strong signal. Down there, the phone line conects to all the phones in the house so all the outlets run off voice over IP.Again - in my situation, the signal is great. Just make sure it will fit yours."
2,Works barely at really short distance and initial setup was a pain,"It barely works and initial setup was troublesome as the 2 boxes didn't want to talk to each other, I finally figured out that the range on this thing is pretty poor worst then on the RCA RC940 which I finally ended up switching to."
2,Probably works - if your phone line is static-free,"I bought this wireless phone jack system to replace another one from GE that didn't work at all (the latter being designed for extension telephones, but NOT modems) for connecting my Dish Network satellite receiver to a phone line.ThePhonex PX-441 Wireless Jack System for Modemsappears to capture most Caller IDs, and I've been able to download help files from Dish to the receiver via phone, but I have yet to be able to make an outgoing connection from the receiver.My phone line isn't the cleanest in the world (I've had AT&T; out several times to resolve my phone line issues, but alas....), but thePhonex PX-441 Wireless Jack System for Modemsdoesn't appear to be very reliable in noisy environments. As a matter of fact, a phone connected to the extension jack will pick up even MORE noise.Given the wide disparity in ratings from other reviewers, perhaps the product has quality problems (some work, some don't) -- mine's not solid."
2,Clear Reception While it Lasts,"I bought this unit for my home office because my phone jack was too far away from my all-in-one with fax, and I didn't want to run a long cord from one end of the room to the other. Set up was very easy, it took only 5 minutes. I have a cordless phone hooked to the base unit and the reception is crystal clear. I don't know how well this unit would work if the base and extensions are in different rooms, but considering the size of the room they're in and all of the electronic equipment in it I am very pleased with the clarity.Edit - Worked perfectly...for less than 4 months. Both the base and extension don't recognize that they're plugged into an outlet. I can't send or receive any faxes."
2,This is not for modem.,"I've been using it for two weeks, and I really disappointed about the quality of this product. It never even close to 50kbps (most likely I've got around 20k), and somethime it's really hard to get the dial-tone.I really don't want to make a hole through the wall, and I was hoping that it could work for me. But I guess it's not. I am much better off with long line. Don't use it for your modem. This is not for your modem."
4,Apprehensive and pleasantly surprised.,"I was left, after installation of a satellite dish system fortelevision broadcast, with no way to hookup a telephone line to the receiving box. After ordering and installing the Phonex PX-441 base and remote to my broadband router and satellite box, respectively, I found it a fine system that even showed the incoming telephone caller's number on the lower right of the TVscreen if it was on during a telephone call. No wires to run, and my remote is 30 to 40 feet apart from base transmitter."
2,CAREFUL about this product!,"I ordered this item from this exact page, and instead of the PX-441 for voice and data, I received the PX-211d. The 211 is just a new model number than the 441, they are basically the same.HOWEVER, there are 2 versions, one with a 'v' after it, and one with a 'd' after it. The 'd' version is only for data, and the 'v' is for voice -and- data. The difference is in the filters. The 'd' version is very staticy and not useable as a voice phone extension, so this didn't cut it for me as voice is what I needed, and why I bought this one.So if you need a DirecTV extension or a modem jack, this is a great product. It does that part just fine. But if you need a voice extension, the title is misleading and you'll be very disappointed. I'll be RMA'ing this one as soon as Smarthome opens up shop today."
1,Works terrible with DSL Enabled lines,"Unit works fine for a while, then simply quits working, but will work again later. Nothing could be done, changed or figured out through the website, instruction manual, etcetera. With DSL you have to use a filter/line splitter. Instructions say to not use a filter/line splitter. This, I believe, is my issue. I guess I will be paying the $5 fee to dish network and running a long extension when we order pay-per-view. Argh!"
2,disappointing,"This doesn't work very well. I get a static filled, weak connection on it- and sometimes no connection at all, for reasons that are a mystery to me. It's better than not having an extension, but just barely."
4,Works Great!!,"The Wireless Jack system works great. I recently purchased TiVo for my living room, and the TV was on the opposite side of the phone jack, so initially I had to run a long phone cord across the room. With the wireless jack everything is fine now - no long cord in the middle of the floor! I haven't had any problems with connectivity whatsoever.CamilleAtlanta, GA"
3,Works better now,"Initially, I had no luck with this device -- too much noise in the line interfering with the signal. For some reason, it has improved since I first bought it, and now my TIVO can usually get a connection. I recommend this product but warn that you may have trouble at times getting a clear connection even if the portable jack is not too far from the actual wall jack."
3,Works okay for cable box but broke in 11 month,"It works for my cable box but after using it for 11 month, it broke! What a waste of money..."
5,Brilliant Read - Even If You're Not a Fan of Scot Ales,"I've read 12 of the 17 Classic Beer Style books so far and in my opinion this one is hands down the best. The great late Greg Noonan does an excellent job covering a beer style that truth be told isn't incredibly popular or complex. He spends the perfect amount of time discussing history of the style (unlike some of the books in the series that go on with this ad nauseum) leaving enough pages to adequately cover malt, water, hops, and the brewing process without ever being too short or too technical. I read this book from front to back - something I've never done with any of the other Classic Style books - and this wasn't even the shortest one! Scottish/Scotch Ales are one of my least favorite styles to drink and brew of the 17 styles in the series, but this is by far my favorite one of the books. I'm confident that if you read this book and listen to Greg's brilliant advice, you'll make a stellar Scot(ch) ale."
4,Scotch Ales,"very informative about the scottish brewing system, which, oddly enough, seems to be more akin to german lagering than to the british ales. some very good tidbits on the history and how to make authentic beers. the issues are that they could have done a better job with hop rates (they use homebrew bitterness units instead of the standard IBU's) and their stronger ales are really double mashes, and should have been a bit clearer on that process (perhaps including something about the gravity readings at the different stages would be helpful). however, a great book, and a very interesting read."
4,As advertised,"The guide does what it purports to do: give you an understanding of the types of questions on the Praxis II and the content that is covered.Do not expect this guide to be in-depth, for the test itself is not about depth, but a veneer-thin covering of all things social studies.The questions were useful for the multiple choice section of the Praxis. The essay portion is really a crapshoot; either you know enough content about a particular topic or not. Though, judging from my and other people's experiences, form is weighted higher than content in the essays.All this said, its was a little pricey, though worth having."
1,Waste of your time,"You'd be better off doing your own research on everything in history, because that is pretty much what you need to do with this book. It guides you to what you should be looking at, but it is not really that helpful."
2,ETS Social Studies Content Knowledge,"The study guide provided generalized questions and a practice test that in no way resembled the actual Praxis II test, which proved to be very daunting. I have taken tests in two other states - NY and FL - and was taking the Praxis II to be certified in PA. Suffice it to say that neither the NY or FL tests were even comparable to the Praxis II Social Studies. I seriously don't know if I can say that I benefited from the ETS manual. The cost of the book didn't justify the claims it made."
2,More useful then the English Content knowledge 0041 Study Scam,"The guide is good for one thing and thats to refresh your memory on all the crap you forgot about in 10th grade history class. With that being said, expect the guide to be of little help when studying for the real ambiguous test which is very difficult asking you questions that just about everyone will get wrong (geography related) but this is by design. Remember that the more times you fail the praxis ll social studies, the more money that ETS makes so of course it's missleading. Good luck and God's speed"
4,Praxis Social Studies,Excellent book was certainly beneficial in taking the Social Studies content area Praxis. I would highly recommend this book for anyone looking to anyone taking the Praxis II for the first time. It gives details almost everything one would need to study for the test.
5,Parfait,"Je recommande ce vendeur. Bonne transaction, bon achat.Livraison rapide. Communication facile avec le marchand. Produit conforme a sa description."
3,small screen and volume is so LOUD!,"My four year old received this for Christmas and really enjoys using it and likes having his ""own computer"". I find the screen to be very difficult to see b/c it's small and dark(black and white). The volume even set at the lower level is so LOUD! Drives me crazy."
2,Small screen V-tech notebook,Screen size too discouraging. My 6 year old was so exited to have a toy computer. His first complaint was I hardly see what I'm doing. Does not realy like playing with it.
3,"Nice, but boring after 5 minutes","My 4-year-old grandson finds this fun for about five minutes, then goes on to something else. AS a former Early Childhood teacher, I have to say that I think the ""computer"" needs a larger screen, color, and an array of different exclamations instead of ""wow""and ""excellent"" every time the child scores. It is however, sturdy, and somewhat easy to use [once an adult spends 30 minutes figuring it out :-)]."
4,"Cute product, small dark screen",This is very cute. Got it for my 20 month old to distract from our laptops. It seems to be holding up well although I do wish the screen was a bit bigger and more well lit. The games are a bit advanced for him as I expected given the age rating on the product but it does work as a good substitution if he finds one of our laptops.
3,Good Product,This product is good I bought two of them. The only thing is that is does not come with a A/C power adapter and it does not look exactely like it does in the picture.
5,This is pretty darn good,"Three cheers for Time-Life Records for putting out a multi-label collection of rowdy country novelty tunes that includes gems like Vernon Oxford's ""Redneck National Anthem,"" Johnny Russell's ""Rednecks, White Socks And Blue Ribbon Beer,"" ""Up Against The Wall Redneck Mother"" by Jerry Jeff Walker, and ""Longhaired Redneck"" by David Allan Coe, as well as Hank, Jr.'s ""Rowdy Friends,"" Travis Tritt's ""Country Club"" all that old Moe & Joe stuff and the ""Dukes Of Hazzard"" theme. Pop a top, buddy -- this disc deserves your full, inebriated attention."
5,Great Life Changing Truths Here,"This book gives great insight into body function and what your body needs from food.

2,JMS had nothing to do with Space Rangers,The previous review is completely incorrect. The series was created by Pen Densham not JMS. JMS had absolutely *nothing* to do with this series.
2,It's a hood but...,"This is indeed a hood, but it's a really odd one. The threads are on the inside of the ring instead of the outside. Huh? How are you supposed to use this thing? With an adapter?"
1,RXrejuvenexprotocol,"I answered an advertisement for the above product. I received a bottle of serum and a bottle of body lotion. I called the telephone number (1-800-375-2356) on the box ""to learn more."" When I asked about 'rejuvenexprotocol' they told me I had the wrong number!!!!! I have not been able to reach anyone that can claim to be connected with this product. As the ad did not state that I would receive additional orders at regular prices I wanted to make sure that I could CANCEL any further shipments. Anyone have any advice what I can do? I DO NOT any more of these products."
1,horrible terrible horrible!!!,"i ordered this book with a gift certificate that i won and i waited anxiusly for it to arrive. when it did it almost broke my heart, i bought it without reading any reviews because it was just being released. IT IS TERRIBLE!!! wow, the only way you may enjoy it is if you are into extremely cheesy sci-fi novels. avoid! or buy with this knowledge in mind. ..."
4,Applications of feminist legal theory,This used book was in excellent condition. The only detractor was the highlighting/underlining of some paragraphs by the previous owner
1,Different Size listed on Website!,"BE WARNED: The website shows that this fits a 16 1/2"" steering wheel. The package states that it fits a 14 1/2"" - 15 1/2"" wheel. The package is right - I returned it.Otherwise it's probably fine for the money. I have one I got from Pep Boys and it feels fine, and will for another year or two if it's like the ones I had 20 years ago. Easy to put on. The reason I purchased this one is that my steering wheel is a bit thick - the one I have doesn't fit all the way around the wheel."
1,cheap,wheel cover looked great when i got it- but when i tried to install it on my 2005 honda cr-v it came apart at the seams- not sewn together properly
1,Cheap junk!,The stairwell covers a cheap junk. They say they will set a steering wheel 4 inches in diameter. My steering wheel my Toyota tundra is 3.3 quarter inch and they do not fit well in their leaves a quarter inch gap. After using the steering wheel cover for about three months it starts to deteriorate. Don't waste your money on this piece of junk.
3,It's OK,The difference in the spot is hardly noticeable. As I learn more I may like it better. I had a spot filter for a different camera (different size lens) and the difference was very noticeable. I think the issue is my learning the situations to use this one.
5,Teabag folding aid/ideas,"Janet Wilson's Tea Bag folding book is great for beginners as well as us ""old pros""! Some terrific ideas to ""run with"", change to your artistic eye and projects that will charm recipients. A good buy."
4,"No Page, No Beck, no problem","There are only two original members left here in the Yardbirds now but give them credit for adding new members who really fit in and carrying on. This was recorded in a smaller venue and gives a good representation of what these guys sound like live nowdays. That sound is good old rock and blues that still sounds great today. Not only do they do the old gems you love but they mix in a few newer songs from their ""Birdland"" cd they put out a few years back. The guitar and harmonica interplay on here is fantastic and the vocals fit in perfectly. As the concert progresses the more these guys just flat out rock! If you used to be a Yardbirds fan give this cd a chance, I think you'll enjoy it."
5,"""A RAVE UP""","THE YARDBIRDS HAVE BEEN AROUND A LONG TIME AND WITH MANY DIFFERENT LINE UPS.THIS LIVE RECORDING WITH ONLY TWO ORIGINALS LEFT IS A VERY GOOD LIVE C D.I WAS RELUCTANT TO BUY IT AT FIRST BECAUSE LIVE RELEASES CAN BE A DISASTER BUT THIS WAS A SURPRISE!I GUESS ""THE YARDBIRDS"" HAVE ALWAYS BEEN IN THEIR COMFORT ZONE WHEN PERFORMING LIVE AND THIS IS NO EXCEPTION.FIRST OFF THE RECORDING IS CRISP AND THE BAND DEMONSTATES THIS WITH ALL THE HITS SUCH AS FOR YOUR LOVE,BETTER MAN THAN I,TRAIN AND HEART FULL OF SOUL.IF YOUR A YARDBIRD FAN DEJA AND COMPANY ARE WORTH THE PURCHASE...."
5,Best Ever Yardbirds,"This is the best yardbirds album/band ever. I saw them live in Stuart, Fl. This album captures the excitement of that performance in a small theater. McCarty and Dreja show that they were the true backbone of the band all along. Idan does an excellent job on bass and vocals, Billy is an excellent addition and Ben King does an admirable job on guitar. I'd recommend this cd to any Yardbirds fan!!! I hope they continue to tour and write new songs. Their new songs are every bit as good as the classics!! See them live!"
4,yardbird's still rock,"new line-up and all the yardbirds are still a good sounding band. if you still follow them you will enjoy this cd,"
3,Do Not read the review by Andrew Hoang,..........if you want to read this book. He gives away the ending in his review.
5,perfect for classic tale introduction,"My son (age 7) is just getting into reading. He loves fantasy, but not ""cool"" fantasy. For example, he likes Harry Potter over Artemis Fowl. He grooves on this series, as opposed to the Myth-O-Mania series. Perhaps it's because he isn't quite old enough for the sarcasm in the other books, but books that take fantasy seriously are up his alley.This book takes the Odyssey seriously. This first installment covers the trojan horse through the cyclops, and he was riveted. When we questioned him for comprehension, he got it all. This book, the way the story was told, completely hooked him.I completely recommend if your boy (or girl) is like mine.(*)>"
3,by HH,"The title of the book was The One-Eyed Giant. The main character is Odysseus. Odysseus was frightened when he saw Polyphemus. The setting was on an island, Ithaca, Troy. When they finally came to their ship once more one of Odysseus' men opened the bag that the wind god had given to Odysseus. I don't like this book because Polyphemus smashed four of Odysseus' men on the ground and ate them. My grandmother would like this book because she likes to sail on ships and Odysseus sailed on a ship in the book. I would give this book three stars because it was not really good because Odysseus and his men could not get home, the wind god could not give Odysseus the storm again when it was not his fault it was his men's fault."
3,"The good, the bad and the goofy","The good: Odysseus was braveThe bad: There was a one-eyed giant that almost smashed himThe goofy: When Odysseus's men saw that Odysseus almost got smashed, they trembled all the way to the ship.Natalie"
5,Great steering wheel cover!,"Excellent value for a versatile steering wheel cover. This particular cover was used for our boat, and was just what we needed. It has a soft feel and fits snuggly around the wheel. So far so good!"
1,Steering wheel cover,"Had been looking for these type of wheel covers for a couple years to replace my old ones.Ordered four of them in two sizes since they were so hard to find.Right product WRONG colorThe box representation of the color is NOT EVEN CLOSE to what I had or wanted!!I wanted the same ""Tan"" color as represented on the box.NOT EVEN CLOSE!!!These were more of a cream color.Too much hassle to return so I'm stuck with them.False representation of the color."
1,Sport Grip,"The Super Wide Sport Grip I puschased was not Tan as I ordered, it was marked tan but the color was closer to parchment or cream. This was not satisfactory for my use so I broke down and purchased a leather wheelskin steering wheeel cover in the correct color and actually it looks much better than the Sport Grip. Granted it was more expensive but it was worth it."
1,Extremely Inconvenient,"I bought this remote to replace a very cheap Radio Shack remote. After using it for a day, I'm putting my batteries back in the Radio Shack remote. We watch a lot of DVDs, and the DVD controls are terrible. In order to use the DVD menu controls, you need to press a 'menu in/out' button. Once you press this, the controller light starts flashing, and it gives you a certain amount of time to make your selection. In other words, if you think your kids are going to use this to pick through the menus on their DVDs, think again."
3,Be prepared to fiddle with it,"I got a Philips 6-device universal remote that looks a lot like this 3-device controller, for use with an Emerson EV818 vcr, and it does the job, although it took some fiddling around. I went through all the Emerson-vcr-specific codes, and couldn't find one that did the trick, so knowing that it was actually manufactured by Daewoo, I decided to try those codes. It was the last code, naturally. Then, I had to figure out which buttons perform the various functions (it was fairly intuitive), but it was easier than returning the thing and spending a lot more for the exact replacement. Hopefully you can extrapolate to your situation from that, but I'm not going to try to generalize. Just be prepared to fiddle with it for a while to figure out whether it will work for you."
2,Did not grip me....,"I never got into this book at all. The characters felt pretty superficial and not written out very well. I usually love Maggie Shaynes books but this one left me ""colder than ice"". I could not fathom how the hero and heroine fell in love with each other. The hero lied all the time and yet she fell in love with him knowing that he had a 'dark' secret. Nope, too far-fetched and the suspense wasn't exactly killing me either. Yawn."
1,Unlikable characters,"Why is it that so many romance writers only know how make a heroine strong by making her sarcastic? I really didn't get into the characters. The heroine was inconsistent - gullible one minute, suspicious and caustic the next. The hero was a good lier and of course had lots convoluted reasons that he needed to lie to her. Blah. If I'd had time to go to the book store, I wouldn't have finished this one."
1,I thought I'd already read it,"I've been a big fan of Maggie Shayne since her Silhouette debut, but this book--I really thought it WAS the same book I'd already read (that WAS Thicker than Ice, there are 2)--I didn't realize they were different books until I went to decide which copy was in better shape to take to the used bookstore.This is the first time I've been disappointed by Ms. Shayne."
1,I hated the heroine................,"I love Maggie Shayne's books and she is so great at developing characters and making the sparks fly! These two had no sparks. The main characters were uninteresting and unlikable and I had a difiicult time finishing the book. The bad guy is just over the top dumb and the whole plot is unbelievable.This is amazing because Maggie Shayne makes Vampires and witches seem perfectly normal, so to read about two actual people and not have it be believable is crazy!"
