3,Mario Party 5,"Its a good game but not a great one. I've played all other games in the Mario Party series and Mario Party 2 was my favorite. They were fun for a while, but Nintendo needs to learn when to stop. The firs flaw I noticed when the Mario Party games emerged was the ""when is it my turn?"" element. There is an improved story mode that doesn't take so dang long. I played a couple story mode maps in an hour. There are some very fun bonous modes, but it isn't worth it. Mario Party 5 is for hard core Mario Party gamers ONLY. Otherwise don't waste your time and money."
3,"Another year, another Mario Party","First off, I'd like to say that my review on Mario Party 4 may've been a bit harsh. That being said, I'm making this review more open-minded, rather than to just say that it's horrible for being another Mario Party game. Of course, if you've played the past games, and did not enjoy them, chances are slim that you'd like this version. Of course, with that in mind, if this is your first Mario Party game, there's a chance you will like it. Regardless of which camp you're in, you'll have more fun if you have three friends playing with you (one player is boring, plus the A.I. is easy)."
3,Where is the online capability?,"THis is great game. Then again, so was MP4. But this one if you are in need of more mini-games. However, i wonder when Nintendo is going to realize that this would make a perfect broadband game. Whats the use of even having the technology available if they arent going to utilize. Thank god that mario kart double dash is online,or else everyone with the broadband adapter would really be screwed."
3,It's getting old..,"Well, after 4 games you can't expect much more. Maybe some better graphics, and new levels, and possibly new characters. Well they chucked in a hundred or so more mini games into this game to try and make money for Nintento, or so it seemed. I got this christmas of 04 I believe it was, and I stopped playing not too soon after. It's a fair game, but like MP4, it has too many additions for its own good; it ruined the solid N64 style of the mario party franchise. I guess this one is up to you. I'd reccomend rent it for a kid whos having a sleep over, or buy it if he has a lot. Overall not that great of a game, or worth buying for that matter."
4,Its pretty good,"I think the latest installment isn't as bad as Mario Party 4, but the best one by FAR is Mario Party 3. I LOVED that game!!!!! The capsules are so-so, as are the minigames. Buy this if your a Mario Party fan, or if your looking for an okay multiplayer game."
3,At Least Good for Parties...,"Mario Party 5 is a great game and is definately worth purchasing if you do not have a Mario Party game for your Gamecube. If you have Mario Party 4, though, you might want to reconsider purchasing this game. The maps are nothing extraordinarily different and brand-new mini-games are few and far between. Maybe Nintendo should have delayed the game a year or two in order to make this game more different than Mario Party 4.Another thing that irks me is that it seems like the computer cheats with the CPU characters. For example, it too-often places the next star location directly in front of the CPU player.Of course, where Mario Party games really shine are at 4-player Nintendo parties. If you are a hardcore Mario Partier, then this game may be just what you are looking for."
5,Cant wait!,"The Mario Partys are really fun, but i think they should stop making mario partys now and start making maybe a mario sunshine 2. Mario games are great! Keep up the good work Nintendo!"
4,tooooo many,"MARIO PARTY 1 and 2were good but 5? common, all you do is roll a dice, move, and play mini games, over and over and over and over....... get my point? Nintendo should have stayed with 1 and 2 or changed the game a little,"
1,Stop it already!!,There are plenty of Mario's already. Let's just say that nintendo should have stopped after 2. We have the cube and are big fans of the children's games but we would like some variety in characters. This is just getting a little redundant an lacks variety. Fun premise but that's it.
3,wellll..................................,"This games ok but uhhhh...ya see I kinda like Mario party 4 better. I just like the levels better and the mini games. Well actually that's the whole point of the game. Im telling you don't play or get this. Well play if you don't agree but I like Mario party 4 better. I don't know there's just something about it that you know. I never really liked these games anyways but you know,....I guess some day they'll make a Mario football because they advertise it too much. The only good one was Mario kart. Which I recommend double dash instead of this peace of crap...!!!"
2,BORING,this is a game i got for christmas. i was excited at first but right after i was very displeased. this game is not only boring but terrible!!!!!!!!!! in story mode after 4 turns you dont even get to play a mini game and hu wants to plays 3 bowsers? and the mini games are babyish and terrible and the levels are terrible! i hate this game!
1,BORING !,"I loved MP4, but MP5 is just plain boring ! I waited and waited for its release and was sadly disappointed in the game. It's slow and not as much fun. Its really easy to get the stars, where's the challenge? Story mode doesn't have anything to work for, and Party Mode is just nothing. The only good thing about it is the new Mini-Games."
1,This is as lousy as mario party 4,"Its true. First of all its not as fun as Mario party 1,2,or 3. This is not good at all. Youll probably want Mario party 1,2,& 3.A person would probably fell disappointed If they bought Mario party 4 or even this. I think they will make a mario party 6. They dident did do a very good job with this or even mario party 4 or even this. They however did a good job with mario party 1,2,& 3."
4,Clarke 1 1/2 HP 1 1/2 Gallon Air Compressor,Great little compressor perfect for finish trim carpentry. What I like most is that this compressor is quiet in comparison to other compressors. It is lite in weight as well which makes it very easy to move around. Good compressor and great price for what you get. I give it a thumbs up all the way! The only draw back is the copper pipe that leads to the tank from the compressor motor to pressurize the tank is exposed enough where it could be damaged. It would have been better to bend the pipe closer to the tank and motor housing to prevent or greatly minimize potential damage.
3,WSUS Review,This book gave me other technical knowledge that Microsoft did not include in their online set up of WSUS.
4,Deep Underground,"met these guys when they were pushing their album at a Rap Pages seminar at the Roosevelt Hotel in LA, must have been 1995. I didn't hear much from them again, but this is a great album. Dark underground beats, and steady flows. I still dig it out once a year. Great mid-nineties independent hip-hop."
4,A Quick History,"This is a very good survey of two of America's most important 19th Century figures. It is a quick read, but covers everything in a way that is readable and illuminating. I agree with other reviewers that those looking for deeper insights into Taney, in particular, might be disappointed. However, where he gives short shrift to both individuals, he makes up for it by bringing the times into fuller context. Moreover, his summary of the major court cases of the era is as good as any I've read."
3,Dread Taney,"Professor Simon takes an extremely understanding view of Chief Justice Taney, the author of the worst decison of all those ever delivered by our U.S. Supreme Court. He lauds Taney's personal politeness and overall ability in the law, while still noting Taney's hatred of Northern abolitionists and stated desire for the South to be able to perserve its ""traditions."" To me, this chief justice richly deserves his infamous place in history.A book that will be enjoyed most by those interested in American legal history and those who--given the current War on Terror-- want background information on a president's war time powers."
3,"Brief book, tends to gloss over details","This is quite a thin book, but with an engaging writing style. It seems to glass over why Taney made such a seemingly radical decision and why he was able to get 6 others to affirm it. Little treatment of his relationshiop with the Catholic church or even what he thought of blacks as individuals.Rather jarring discussion of George W. Bush and Rumsfeld, where he takes the predictable liberal positions, while excusing Lincolns' abuse of arresting a sitting Ohio congressman. Not one word about controversy of whether Taney had been targeted for arrest by Abraham Lincoln.This book whets your appetite for more and is good for someone who doesn't have the time to read a more detailed study."
4,The well-known and the overlooked,"An excellent book well researched and incorporates primary source material. Excellent for High School research. I teach AP US History and it was a God-send to me in providing material about the Supreme Court, Lincoln and his reasoning, and conflicts in Civil War era society. Excellent perspective on the Dred Scott decision."
1,Very Strange,"I found this movie, in a word, awful. Cheaply done, and quite corny, it's all just a set-up to give a person the ""willies"". The sets were decent enough, but the acting and costumes are... bizzare. For instance, the young viking obviously does not have blonde hair, so they set a thick wig upon his head.The acting is less than quality. It's safe for young children to watch, but I don't know how long they'll stay interested. All-in-all, this movie makes a good unintentional comedy. If you like cheaply done movies - go for it."
1,Gothic novel Sinn Fein,"This is a gothic romance novel. However I have a problem with the propaganda about Sinn Fein and the IRA. This covers so many aspects of murder and terror of the IRA. It puts a positive slant on Sinn Fein. Looking back at the terroism of those years early 19 and 20th century which I lived through I think that the IRA plot of the story is just wrong. The story of Deirdra and her life choices is interesting. But that is the only good thing I have to say. So now being an old Irish lady and remembering the bombings and such this book is going in the trash. I guess it takes Sept 11, 2001 to teach the world forever what terrorism is. So I do not recommend this book."
1,For General Information,"In response to the first reviewer's use of the term ""Father,"" Mr. William McNamara was laicized by the Holy See several years ago and may no longer function or present himself as a priest of the Roman Catholic Church or as a member of the Carmelite Order."
3,Be informed,"This book gives some interesting viewpoints that differ from mainstream Christianity, and many of which I believe are true. However, if you are looking for a book with substantiated proof, you will be disappointed. Much of what is said, is going to have to be taken on faith, because the author claims it to be so, and has evidence yet does not provide it in many instances. In the end, interesting to mull over, but personally, I feel if someone claims something to be true, and states they have evidence, then evidence should be provided."
1,Did not ever receive,"Waited three months for this order - unconscionable delay, finally had to cancel the order"
3,Tonight we love (each other),"I agree with the only other review at this point. A true Rufus lover would enjoy this more. Not liking it only because Chaka is not on it, is an injustice. On the other hand, I enjoy it for the song ""Tonight we love."" I know it is only one song out of the many here. But, I grew up grooving the uptempo songs of the 70's and 80's, and this was one of them. Com'on, you remember it too! Amazon, you gotta put the LP songs on review sample so that the prospective buyers can taste it for themselves. Most people would have this LP on vinyl or cassette though."
2,Sir Henry At Ndidi's Kraal,"I heard that Viv Stanshall never wanted this recording to be released ... I think his record company might have done well to have heeded his wish.Although funny in a few places, it is not a patch on the previously released ""Sir Henry at Rawlinson End"".If you loved ""Sir Henry at Rawlinson End"", then it is worth listening to ""Sir Henry At Ndidi's Kraal"", but don't expect it to be a patch on the first one."
1,Deceit,"They did not send the stick that is displayed in the photo. They sent me a samller, thinner stick that you can buy on ebay for $4.99. As a result I was charged $17.44 (shipping included) for a stick that costs $7.00 (shipping included). What a freakin rip off."
3,Sonic Flags And Jackie Chain,"JOMF sa albumom Flags Of the Sacred Harp nam nedonose nista novo, cak sta vise vracaju nas u '80 kada su Sonic Youth, Jesus And Mary Chain, i kompanija radili ono sto JOMF rade danas. Od ukupno sedam pesama samo tri su vredne paznje: Nice One(koja bi bila mnogo efektnija da traje pet minuta umesto deset, tacnije 10:11), Rockaway i odlicna Hey! Mr. Sky koja neodoljivo potseca na pocetnu fazu benda Mazzy Star. I to je to. Ostatak cine Spirits u trajanju od 16:11 a vas agonija hvata kada ce kraj pesme vec posle treceg minuta, Good Mornin Kaptain koja samo prodje pored vas, Loud And Mighty gde zenski vokal zvuci kao uspavana PJ Harvey koja traljavo odradjuje svoj posao i napokon The Louder Roared The Sea od 16:07 posle kojeg se ovaj album i zavrsava.Da je kojim slucajem ovaj album izasao osamdesetih dobio bi cistu peticu ovako samo bleda trojka. Casopis Q (2/5), Mojo (4/5)."
4,Useful Insights to Hemingway's Short Stories,"I purchased this to help understand Hemingway'sIn Our Timewhich I jumped into cold.This is a useful guide. It does cover several of the stories in the collection I was reading although it does not comment on the overall significance of this specific collection.Included are a biographical essay, lists of characters, story commentaries and a Hemingway bibliography."
2,steelhead fly fishing on the Olympic Peninsula,The book had a lot of fishing stories but not much on how to fish for steel head.My favorite was Fishing the Hoh River. More how to & where in that book.
1,Not Wilkie Collins' best,"If you have read ""The Moonstone"" and ""The Woman in White"" and are looking for a Wilkie Collins fix, walk right on by""The Legacy of Cain"". An indignant indictment of Victorian prejudices which lacks the subtle evocations of atmosphere that Collins excels at, ""Legacy"" fails to round out its characters and is short on plot. Consider yourself warned."
2,the legacy of Cain,"Boring, ho hum, did I mention boring? Some much visual detail that the story was lost won't be getting any more of these from Collins"
1,Be warned...,"I really don't know why I continue to do this to myself, but I've had three VTech phones - maybe I just trust that the bugs get worked out, or I get fooled by other simpletons who write positive reviews on this website (which would make me a simpleton too, I would imagine). This phone - flat out - does not work. It loses power to the base for completely inexplicable reasons, dropping calls and putting your phone out of service for no reason whatsoever. I will now have to go through the annoyance of sending this product back to Amazon (which I have never had to do, but I hope their return policy is lenient), and I warn you - do not be fooled like me. The fancy features and convenience of this phone means nothing when it flat out does not operate. I am NOT a technologically challenged individual; this phone is simply poorly made. Spend your money elsewhere. I wish I had..."
5,Great sound quality and range,"I have been very please with the sound quality, range and features of this phone set. it was easy to setup, and just works. The menu interface is very easy to read, bright displays on the phones. great phone set and expandable!"
2,Everything But Negotiating,"Pinet does a good job at covering all the different aspects of negotiating including negotiating personality types, nonverbal communication, and some tactics. What this book lacks is a proper framework for negotiation, or if it is there, then it is lost underneath the pile of other information that is tossed into the book. This book also does not even go into the aspects of conflict that inevitably result from negotiating and must be dealt with. There is nothing mentioned about reframing interests, or active listening to address concerns. If you want to know everything else about negotiating then this book is great, but if you want to know the true framework for a real negotiation, then this book is seriously lacking."
2,Good general process description but forgets to mention the exceptions,Liza does a good job walking you through the process but she fails to mention that not everyone feels/ reacts the same for each step. I found the HSG test to be extremely painful and had a horrible reaction to the progestrone shots. I wish everyone the best of luck with IVF and just remember everyone's body is different.
4,Good Book - But Get this One Too...,"My wife and I found this book helpful in our struggles with infertility. It is well-written and fairly comprehensive.But we recently got ""What to Do When You Can't Get Pregnant"" by Dr. Daniel Potter and Jennifer Hanin (he's a Reproductive Endocrinologist AND fertility patient, she's a journalist, succesful patient of his and mother of twins). I can't recommend this book enough. It is engaging, comprehensive, and covers aspects of IVF that no other books have covered - all in an understanding, helpful tone.We especially liked the chapters on surrogacy (including the interviews with surrogates and families having children through surrogacy), what to tell your children, and the latest technologies for determining genetic problems BEFORE you get pregnant.Make sure you get BOTH of these books!"
5,A must read,I purchased and read several books about IVF and this was the best by far. It included all of the scientific information in an easily understandable narrative and also practical advice written as if from a friend. I found it much more helpful (and up to date) than the other books I purchased. I have found myself going back to it again and again as I go through the IVF process.
3,Great if you are in the very beginning stages.,"I found this book to be a bit boring and repetitve of all the info I have found on the web and through my doctors. It definitely appealed more to the emotional side, which is needed so much in this field, but I was looking for concrete suggestions on maximizing my chances with IVF and I didn't really find that in the book. It's a helpful read if you are just beginning the process and need some solid basic information, but not as helpful if you are already well informed."
2,"Good Info, But Trite and Patronising","The book is filled with good definitions about the winding road that is IVF-fertility treatment is packed with acronyms, abbreviations, and science, and the author does do a good job of explaining what all of the acronyms and abbreviations are. The book flows well and has wit, but the constant underlying message is one of success! IVF succeeds! Just keep your legs in the air/take to bed rest/keep thinking smiley happy positive thoughts and it always works! As someone who's been through a few rounds of IVF and ongoing still, it's not that easy for most people. IVF is hard enough without infusing constant messages of false hope-I feel the author is irresponsible in suggesting that IVF can be otherwise."
4,"Great ""first"" book to read.",Gave me really good information. I was pretty clueless when I picked up this book. Explained everything to me in simple terms. Loved that it has a glossary in the back to reference. Wouldn't read this if I was already familiar with the process though.
5,An extremely informative and BALANCED view of an emotionally and physically complex process.,"Liza Charlesworth has done a service to infertile couples everywhere. As a mental health professional who treats infertile couples, I am compelled to say that this book gives a careful, thoughtful account of the pros and cons of IVF, with many helpful suggestions for self-advocacy for those pursuing the procedure. IT IS A VERY EMPOWERING, ENCOURAGING, INFORMATIVE VOLUME! I recommend it most highly. Although Ms. Charlesworth and her husband are themselves an ""IVF Success Story"", Ms. Charlesworth nonetheless has no ""ax to grind""; that is she does a wonderful job encouraging others to make an independent decision as to whether IVF is truly right for THEM. Thank you, Ms. Charlesworth, for your engagingly written and deeply helpful book!"
3,Use the internet and pass on this one,While it does have lots of info it is nothing that I didn't already know from joining forums online and doing online research. Save your dough because IVF is going to cost you and do the research online for free.
1,THIS BOOK IS A JOKE,I THOUGHT THIS BOOK WOULD HELP ME WHILE MY HUSBAND AND I WERE GOING THROUGH IVF...IT DIDN'T. IT DEPRESSED ME AND CONFUSED ME. IT'S HARD ENOUGH TO GO THROUGH INFERTILITY WITHOUT LIZA CHARLESWORTH MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT. IF YOU SEE THIS ON THE SHELVES...RUN!!!!
5,Aida Japan!,This CD amazes me! I bought it while on a trip to Tokyo and thought it was amazing how well they managed to sing the lyrics in Japanese along with the original Aida score. This is one of my favorite shows and hearing it in Japanese was such a treat. A must have for an Aida or musical fan!
4,Agreeing with Arthur Waldron!,"While it took me fifty pages to get into the book, once I was there, I was hooked. I found myself to be reading through the night, absolutely intent to find out how the now-adult relationship would play out for Liz,Hanna, and Jeanne. It is a new twist on the coming-of-age novel. A twist that all of us who have maintain grade school friendships have or will have to journey through as we enter adulthood. Campbell writes with precision without taking away from the reader's own introspection. Perhaps one of the best Campbell has written and I have read them all!"
4,30 yr old incident haunts three friends,"Three friends, Hannah, Jeanne and Liz, come together in the same small town 30 years after a traumatic incident which occurred during their lives at age 12. A boy who threatened one of them died during that summer, and each of the three women feels guilt over that death which traumatizes their adult lives, decisions and relationships. The characters are well-drawn; there is loyalty, love, friendship and forgiveness... to each other and to/for others in their lives. Each reaches for this in her own way."
4,"REAL WOMEN, REAL LIVES","What I liked most about WILDWOOD was the women themselves: Hannah, Liz and Jeanne. Their upscale California lifestyles seemed real to me, not ya-ya, and so did their problems and I felt like I knew them and wanted to find out if their long friendship was going to survive the truth. Women's friendships are hard to write about realistically but I think this author did a good job. Another thing I liked was that Hannah, Jeanne and Liz were trying to be good friends, loving parents, wives etc, but they made mistakes like real people do so resentment and grudges and forgiveness became issues between them and part of what the book is about. The writing is good, sometimes really good. The arguments about abortion were important.I wish I belonged to a book group because there's lots to think and talk about in WILDWOOD."
3,Not a 5* but good.,I liked this book. There was good character development. It skipped around a lot without chapter changes so you had to have good recall on which character she was talking about. Interesting plot although its been done before.
2,not great,"I thought the characters were very shallow and entire chapters could have been cut from this book without retracting from the somewhat meandering plot. It wasn't an exciting read at all, despite the decription and scenes that should have been captivating were downright boring."
2,Mom of 5-year old twin girls,"This dollhouse is cute but not as nice as I expected for the price. The kitchen table leg broke the first day of play, as well as a kitchen chair. Larger rooms would make it more fun and the family room could use more furniture than just a couch. In looking back, I should have spent the extra money and bought the larger Play & Store Dollhouse and furnished it myself. Not made as well as MY Barbie toys -- I am disappointed."
2,I don't recommend this house at all,"This dollhouse is difficult for little ones to fold up. You will have to do it for them. And there are way too many little parts to get lost, stepped on, and spread all over your house. I recommend the Fisher Price Special Edition Townhouse. It has all the positive features of this one and more. Easy for my kids to fold, lots of options on accessories and other dolls to add, and not so many little and flimsy parts!"
1,DVD TRAVESTY!,A real real disappointment. The appalling quality of the DVD version of this movie really does make a mockery of the format. Don't buy this under any circumstances! Seek out the Salvation VHS version from the UK. A real shame. This is one of the greatest examples of the genre. A visual and aural work of genius ruined by the terrible quality of the DVD
1,Not a good choice,"Hi,I am generally very happy with the stuff I've purchased on Amazon from a variety of different manufacturers. But this one not only does not work- it literally stopped working a day after it arrived!!!!Please go for something of better quality/different brand, even if it costs a few dollars more.Best wishes,A customer from LA"
1,It Sucks...,"It stopp working after like a week, even on new batteries. Plus there is no anti-skip though they say there is. I bought a different one at toysrus on sale for alitle bit more money and it works like a charm. It's betta than this piece of crap! Well...you get what you pay for."
2,hmm,i dunno i htoguth this cd was knida cheesy sounding. mabye i didnt like it cuz the first song really sucked and i lost intrest from the start. whenever i listen to it i always skip the first track. this cd is quite annoying at some parts also. dont buy this cd unless youve heard it before and really liked it.
1,Don't buy this reissue,"If this repackage is the ""Big Beat"" reissue, it is a ripoff and it will ruin our listening experience of two milestones in modern music. For one thing, volume 1 and 2 were carelessly packed on the same CD, a debatable choice, but let's say not dramatic. Where it hurts is the passage from one track to the other, where audible ticks and music discontinuity kills the original music flow.This is particularity annoying on volume 2. Theoretically there are 20 titles or so on the album, but when it came out, we listened to side one and then side two has a whole, not even noticing the passage from one song to the other. But this re-edition artificially reminds you that the track has changed, certainly not the way this masterpiece was intended.I simply threw this re-edition in the garbage and ordered the single re-editions, hoping I'll get better quality."
1,A piece of JUNK!!!!,Took my dogs out on it once for about three minutes. Went to put it on for another walk and one of the latching mechanisms simply fell apart. I want a refund.
2,DANGER,"I have a Chihuahua and a Boston Terrier, one out weighing the other by 10 lbs give or take a little. You must have dogs of equal weight or strength because the boston pulls the chihuahua around and the chihuahua kept getting strangled and pulled all over the place. I ended up having to pick up the boston and let the other one have a minute to take his time to go to the bathroom. What a waste"
2,Misleading length,"I thought my dogs would have space to walk a bit away from eachother with this leash coupler. I figured 36"" is long enough but if its 36"" end to end minus an ninch or two for the coupler piece, your dogs wont get but 15"" each. I have 2 small Chihuahuas. 3lbs and 9lbs and it doesnt take much at all for the bigger chi to drag the little one along. She would have to be walking exactly at his pace and keep up or get dragged. If each end of the leash was 36"" it would have worked out better. Its definitely made well and heavy duty. Its just not long enough even at the full 36"" split. The dogs need to be close and walk at the same even pace. NOT likely!!"
4,Good Leash,Good leash and appears to be mad out of strong material. I just wish each leash was a little bit longer.
2,Broken after a one week,"It worked fine for a ONE week. Then, the two dogs pulled in different directions and one of them was already running off leash; it was broken!"
4,well made and great price. Item not adjustable for big dogs,Great item works very well for my 70 lbs boxer and 55 lbs dalmation.the adjustable feature doesnt work with a good puller.I love the 36'' exept when it drags and the dog gets tangled.
5,Great product!!!!,"This product was awesome, very well constructed & strong enough for those dogs who don't know their own strength. We are very pleased with this product & would highly recommend it to anyone."
5,great addition to my living room,great map to see all those tiny countries in Europe. It's also beautiful. People love to stop and look at it.
1,GARBAGE,thinks this record stinks. BORING. Maybe they should hang it up. It's a waste of money. Sorry I hate it.
5,its ALLtacular!,"this cd is amazing if you like ALL at ALL you wont be disapointed standout tracks are carry me, www.sara and alive..."
5,Historical Romance At It's Best,"Cinnamon Wharf is one of my favorite books. I've read it numerous times and each and every time that I read it I enjoy it even more. Janice Young Brooks creates a very believable portrait of Victorian gentry, and the travel chapters in the novel are simply fascinating, and very well researched I might add. The Beecham's are a family you will want to get in touch with again and again. Don't shy away from the listing of ""romance novel"" it's worthy of a much more distinguished categorical identity.~Rosemary for Remembrance~"
3,"OK, But Not As Good As Her Debut","This release was okay, but no where near as good as her debut. However, the title track ""I Dream In Color"" is an absolute gem and her cover of ""Misty Blue"" is breath-taking. Much of the rest of the CD is just alright. It's not bad at all, it's just alright. I would buy this if you are a fan of hers, but if you have never heard of Daniele Alexander, buy her debut release instead."

1,not packed well,arrived as a big mess. not worth returning it. Would suggest a better packaging for mail. Otherwise product is good
3,My fish don't seem to like it as much as other food,"My Goramis like it but they'll eat anything. The actually will eat from my pinched fingers. My rasboras eat only the white flakes and ofter spit them out. The Cherry Barb and Neon Tetras like the food the be crushed to smaller pieces so they sink quicker and get away from the Goramis which tend to be more aggressive top feeders. The Tetras also favor the light color flakes. I'll try something different next time.Update: 2 weeks later and they seem to be adjusting. They still don't seem to like the pink flakes as much as the others. I wonder, is it a color or flavor issue?"
5,Best Shrimp & Fish food!,"When I feed my fish even my turtles nibble at it all the time everyone loves this stuff. This kinda outa the other Tetra fish food provides the most nutritional diet and while feeding the water is much cleaner/clear, no more light amber tint,(amber tint settled after 5mins of the filter being turned back on so it wasn't bad). Also if you have shrimp, not glass bc you wont tell, but you have green or cherry shrimp it makes them pop with color just after 5-7days of eating it makes your aquarium look awesome. Good food, good price, free shipping... buy some!!"
3,Tasty!,"This is flake style fish food. My fish love it, they think its tasty. Me, I'm glad its a buck or so cheaper than the local petco."
3,"misleading product info, but still cheaper than petstore","I was hesitant to buy because the product info said that this was a 2.75ounce container but the picture had a 2.2ounce container. I know Tetra is running a 25%more promotion now so i though that this would be the promotional 2.75ounce container so i took a dive and bought it. Two days later I received a 2.2ounce container, disappointed. They should change the product name to reflect that, otherwise its misleading"
4,NICE COMEBACK,"A SOLID EFFORT BY THE BOYS .THERE IS NO ONE KILLER TRACK BUT MORE SOLID THROUGHOUT WHICH IS NOT A BAD THING.MR.GARCIA IS STEADY BOTH AT LEAD AND RIFFING AND SADLY OVERLOOKED AS ONE OF THE BEST.HEAVIER THAN THEIR EARLIER RELEASES BUT TRUE TO THE CLASSIC SOUND OF AGENT STEEL.SOME VERSIONS HAVE THE BONUS COVER OF PRIEST'S ""BEYOND THE REALMS OF DEATH""=CHECK IT OUT!"
2,This Indiana boy thought it was alright,"Yes Tournament Upstart was a pretty good book if you ask me, but it could have been better. There were very heart warming parts in this book, but there were also parts that left me wondering what was going on. I liked the story about them off the court, but I thought the game scenes could be a little more discriptive. Now and then I thought the writer didn't know what he was talking about. There were times in some of the games were I was lost and confused (might just be me). The reason I read the book was to get some good basketball action like the state tournament around here, and I didn't get any out of this book. The games weren't described in enought detail for me (again probably just me). There were many times I felt there was something familiar about the story (anyone seen the movie Hoosiers?), the coach's motivational speeches were just a little familiar. This is what kept me from really liking the book but all in all it was alright."
2,Another Tree Grows in Brooklyn and Keeps Right On Going,"This is a book with brightly colored illustrations that shows the imaginings of a little girl and her mother as they discuss the tree seedling that the little girl finds wilting on a hot summer day in Brooklyn. There's nothing particularly interesting about the story. It's a conversation between two people who are enjoying topping each other's ""tall tale"" type of ideas for the tree's future. It would be a sweet thing to observe in real life because of the warm-hearted spontaneity it would require but when it's transferred to paper it becomes stilted. The pictures are each lively and bright but there is little to distinguish one picture from the next. Not a bad book, just not a good book."
1,Terrible book,"Dear Public,This book is way too obvious - waste of money. The author and his friends wrote all the 5 star reviews for this book and his last."
1,It's a two hour commercial for Bill Wilson.,"Don't buy this unless you want to watch 2 hours of Bill Wilson promoting his own products. There is very little technical information presented. This video was produced in 1997 and is a transfer from videotape (a bad one at that). Looks like it was produced in a garage. Looks like Lenny Magill bought up a bunch of old videos, transferred them to DVD and is trying to milk more profits.Again, don't buy if you're looking for information on how-to.I'm returning mine."
5,Very good,"I have been a fan of EnVogue since I first heard ""Hold On"". Bought all of their albums. When I read that they were doing hip hop lyrics to classical music, I have to admit that I had my reservations. They proved me wrong, this is truly one of their best albums (my personal favorite is Funky Divas). It's a shame that this record wasn't promoted well; Maxine, Cindy and Terry have the best singing voices, both solo and collectively as a group. In my opinion, they can out sing all of the girlgroups out today. If you are thinking of buying this one, don't hesitate. Buy it, you won't be disappointed. My faves are Those Dogs and Love You Crazay."
3,I dunno about this one...,"Ugh...I dunno about this one. Yes, this album called ""Masterpiece Theater,"" I love En Vogue but the music presented on this 4th album of their's is very different! A few of the tracks are good such as ""Riddle,"" ""Love Won't Take Me Out,"" ""Falling In Love,"" and ""Love You Crazay."" But the rest of the songs are just hard to like or even feel, especially the title track: ""THOSE DOGS."" That song I can't stand and usually skip it. It wasn't exactly a masterpiece in my opinion but maybe to someone else it is. Funky Divas, Born To Sing and EV3 are way better albums and so much better than this! I wish they had just kept their same style of music instead of going and changing it! Most of the CD sounds like classical music and I think I heard some music from the nutcracker in one of the tracks. The album has a few good songs on it including ""riddle,"" and then the rest are just kind of boring. I'd recommend any of their other albums over this one!"
2,Hardly A Masterpiece,"I have previously enjoyed En Vogue recordings, though this is my first CD I have purchased by them. Comparing it to classic En Vogue singles & new Lucy Pearl, this album stands no chance. I did actually like about 4 of the CD's 14 tracks (two of the fourteen tracks are actually interludes surrounding the ""En Vogue Love Suite""). Riddle, Love U Crazay, Latin Soul, and Those Dogs stood out to me, and made me feel like this album wasn't a TOTAL bust. After so many other good releases, it's a real shame they had to attempt a comeback with this dismal release. Here's to a suitable and enjoyable return for the Funky Divas in the near future."
2,Not really a Masterpiece,"As I reviewed the other comments posted, I noticed that the majority of the reviewers were male. I also referred to these same comments before I purchased this CD. I regret that I did not follow my instinct to just WAIT until another friend has bought it. The album itself is not terrible. I have spent weeks trying to figure out if I like it or if I hate it which to me means that there is nothing special about it. I loved the single ""Riddle"" and like ""Falling in love"" and ""Beat of Love"" but given a choice between these singles and others by another artist, I would probably pick the other artist. So basically if you have $15 to donate to EnVogue, go ahead and buy the album. If you are a thrifty music buyer like I am - proceed with caution."
2,Well...,"I bought this used two days ago and I'm pretty glad I didn't pay full price. Mind you, Masterpiece Theater is not as bad everyone is saying, but by no means is it good. It's definitely below average. The production is just alright. At times, it is quite mediocre, cheesy and basic. The vocals are not very good. As mentioned by another reviewer, the ad-libs are bad and there is definitely some off-key singing on here. The songs are so, so repetitive and the nice harmonies cannot save them. The songs are poorly written, the lyrics are not great. Some may call the sampling of classical masterpieces as ingenious, but I see it more as a scheme to make their songs instantly familiar without having to pay the big check. (After 50 years of a composer's death, the samples can be used free of charge and without credit.) Also, the no-name rappers are terrible. There are one or two alright songs on here, unfortunately, I can't really remember which ones."
1,A masterpiece?,"I have been waiting for something new and fresh from the funky divas of soul and unfourtunatley, this aint it. ""Masterpiece Theater is yet another tired example of what happens when artists choose to stick with what they think works. This album takes no chances at all. I know that artists are always afraid that if they try something new, the fans won't repond well to it. But art is all about taking chances, going out of the box. These ladies are very talented, I just wish they would dump thier producers and get with people that are all about taking chances, not about recycling the same sound over and over. This album sounds no different from any other girl groups out today, and I expected something better from En Vouge."
2,No Masterpiece Here,"There was a time when no female group could touch En Vogue. Not only did they possess flawless vocal and harmonizing ability, but they actually produced some pretty good stuff to listen to. It's sad to say that that day has passed, as is evident with ""Masterpiece Theater"". While their last album(and first without Dawn Robinson),EV3, was slightly below the quality of the first two records, this one is way below the level of anything that they have put out. The only good song on the album, ""Riddle"", actually swipes a sample of one of their previous hits. Talk about desperate."
1,No Masterpiece Here!,"Why did I buy this album, I HAVE NO IDEA!. This is a HORRIBLE album, only 1 song came off of this album and it barely charted hitting #93 on the R&B chart. ""Riddle"" was the only release from this album that I am aware of, how this group went from ""EV3"" to this piece of ...., is beyond me. They went even lower going from ""Funky Divas"" to this. Going from 8 Top 40 hits in a row to this is beyond me. There is NOTHING good about this album. And that is a riddle."
2,A true Disasterpiece,"Definately NOT, EV's best work. Vocals were terrible, but the phat beats kept me listening. They're still my girls though!"
1,Here's a riddle,"WHEN DID ENVOGUE get a career? i missed it! they think they can add some WBLS hiphop beat to a song and call it an ALBUM. wrong, the other member left in time before this group LOST ANOTHER DIME"
3,An excellent resource for understanding our differences...,"This is an excellent resource for understanding differences in the way people think, feel, and behave both within the family and in the workplace. Understanding the different components of the temperaments and increasing awareness of our differences is just the first step toward improving communication and relationships, and this book is the perfect introduction to the topic."
5,ON TARGET!!,"As a Dating, Marriage, and Divorce Counselor, as well as a Staff Placement Consultant for professional corporations, my expertise is the Myers Briggs Type Indicator. I have personally interpreted one-on-one more than 1,500 Indicators. Please Understand Me is the book I recommend all those who take the test to read first. It is simple. Well-formatted. To the point. Informative. Accurate. It is wonderful to see light bulbs come on in people's heads when they read about themselves through this book. Thank goodness for Keirsey and Bates who took the time to write this book! I recommend it highly for people who desire to learn about themselves. The most terrific thing is that the reading is not only simple, it's lots of fun!!Dr. P."
4,FUN way to look at personality,This is a really fun easy way to look at your personality. it is useful to give to couples so they can understand each other better. Just remeber this is only one of many theories and not everyone will fit the mold.
4,Please understand!,I like the idea of the personality types. It's amazing how accuarte the description of myself and others is.
3,Good info/lacks precision,"Having met Jon Niednagel about 20 years ago I am an absolute believer in ""Brain Type"". This book provides good information, however, mis-leads when allowing people to self determine their individual type via a ""test"". Most of us answer questions as we prefer to see ourselves and not as we truly/innately are designed.Anyone interested in type would benefit from following Niednagel's research. My guess is that the people commenting here that claim to be INTJ'S or INTP'S are choosing their preferred type and missing their actual type which is likely ENTP."
4,Excellent support materials for the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator,"Keirsey and Bates have supplied excellent supplementary materials for administrators of the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, with even more clear-cut insight and research into the four temperament types. The only flaw is in the Keirsey Temperament Sorter which has no reliability or validity studies behind it and may misrepresent those whose preferences are borderline."
2,Not very insightful,"All this test does is ask you to choose between a bunch of adjectives and preferences, and it summarizes what you've chosen, adding a few minor qualities. It's nice of Kiersey et al (what happened to Ms. Bates in the second edition?) to gather this information for us, but it hardly qualifies as some great source of insight."
4,Please Understand Me,"I found this to be an incredibly eye-opening reading experience. I was unfamiliar withthis form of analysis of temperament types. It is a valuable tool in my efforts to learnwhy people communicate in such different ways from such varying foundational beliefs. It hashelped me to better understand relationship misunderstandings and miscommunications. It is a toolto prevent us from being judgemental as we learn how others are different from ourselves- not wrong,just different in their goals and approaches."
5,Easy to use and amazingly accurate,"I'm a sucker for ""personality type"" quizzes, but this is a winner. The test went quickly, and was so astonishingly accurate about me that I found myself reading everything else I could get my hands on about the Myers-Briggs theory of personality types. Later I took the full test and had it interpreted by a qualified professional -- and the results were exactly what I discovered from the self-test in this book. The Myers-Briggs is a great tool for understanding yourself and others, and, on the basis of my experience and my reading, I'd recommend this book as the best place to get started."
2,Insufficient,"If you are an instructor and looking for a quick reference guide to APA formatting, this guide is not it."
3,"read the other reviews, too","I should have paid attention to the other reviews, but I was hoping that maybe this would give me the examples I was looking for. Nope, I was wrong. It is about as scarce with additional information about APA style as other reviewers suggested. It is literally a book on how to go through the APA manual, not necessarily finer points about APA style. For me, it was not more helpful. It has just proven to be more paper to put on a shelf.In its defense, I may not have spent the amount of time looking through the book that I should have to find it useful."
3,Can't use it if it's on Amazon!,"As someone else mentioned, this is a testbank more than a user manual. As an instructor, that WOULD have been great as it would have saved me a lot of time in creating tests. But HELLO, I can't use a testbank that is available to all my students through Amazon!! Most publishers of academic sources go to a lot of effort to protect the sanctity test banks, but apparently it did not occur to the APA to keep this one off of Amazon. Too bad, because now I can't use it."
1,never came in the mail,"I bought this book and they never sent it, still waiting to here from the company on y the book never came."
2,God Of Death Book#2,"Sorry I can't review this, because the person I was to purchase it from found out they didn't have it in stock. So I got a refund.This twice this has happended, not with the same person but two others.Better record keeping may help.William"
4,good solid film,this is really a solid film.Bill Murray gives one of his best performances ever.Andie Macdowell does well also.very funny film.
4,Almost perfect.. but not quite,"Bill Murray's best performance, to date, is captured in this film. What proof do I have to offer? He actually makes the audience believe that Andie McDowell is a decent human being worthy of admiration and talent."
5,Expedient shipper,"The movie arrived in the mail surprisingly fast, my only problem is I keep watching it everyday at 6:am (just kidding)The movie was brand new as advertised and would definitely buy again from the same vendor."
5,A chance to make the same mistake twic,"Watch this film in a double with State and Main. They share a theme, and a lot of very funny material. GD is wry. Irritating the first time through, I realized that it was meant to be. That's the way life can seem when you don't see any difference from one day to the next -- when you don't learn anything. Great film."
4,A unique and delightful movie,"Here's a movie that provides some humor, some romance, and an uplifting message. I think it would appeal to almost anyone."
3,"Love the movie, hate the quality.","I watch this movie every year with my family on Groundhog Day, kind of a tradition. Love it every time. Unfortunately the quality of the copy that you watch through amazon is almost as bad as a really old VHS tape. The sound was horrible, conversations had to be turned up which made background sounds louder than they should have been. The Muppets Christmas Carol was the same way, worse in the fact that the version they have for rent actually omits an entire musical number. My solution, don't rent or buy any digital versions that happened to have been released pre-DVD era."
3,Six more weeks of extras needed....,"(Instead of reviewing a film you probably already know, I stick to DVD special features)Those Extras:Commentary: Great job from Ramis, who covers all technical, location and casting aspects of this favorite. Pretty much no stone unturned. Ramis is really coming off as one of the better directors to handle DVD running commentaries.New Interviews: Only half good. I'm getting really sick of the star of the movie not showing up to talk about it. Instead we get McDowell and Tobolowsky---who comes off a little too into the movie---along with Ramis and writer Rubin. The HBO original BTS would've really bouyed this. Glad I taped it back then :).Overall: Sorry to say that's it. Lacking the ususal fun stuff of a Collector's Edition leaves a fan disappointed. Ramis nearly saves that with his fine effort on the audio track."
5,Format: Blu-Ray,"Just about anytime this is on the tube, I'll sit down and watch it - commercials and all. This is just one of those kind of movies, and happened to be when Bill Murray was at his best. Why I didn't have it on DVD before is a mystery to me, but there was no cringing at paying $9.99 for this on Blu-Ray. Quality just fine thank you.Perhaps I'll write the same exact thing tomorrow....(or, did I write this yesterday?)"
5,Attachment to a Moment,"This film features classic Murray and a stellar supporting cast, including the luminous Andi MacDowell (yes, I believe we're related somehow). The story is all about clearing obstacles and giving up attachment. And it's so funny at times your sides will ache from laughing so hard. Include the film as a reference in your spiritual practice. You may find it works for you, too!--Robert McDowell, The Poetry Mentor[...]"
5,"Funny, original film","I remember when this came out. Bill was on ""GMA"" & did the weather.Funny, original film. You wish comedies were ALL like this.Bill did a great job as Phil. All the things he did in the film as February 2 kept repeating.Harold in his bit part as the doctor. Another cameo by Willie Garson (Stanford from Sex & the City, There's Something About Mary).Decent extras on the DVD.BUT, an anniversary edition? Needed more. Like.........NO CHAPTER LIST OR ANY INFORMATION INSIDE ON THE FILM. The film was a hit & this is an anniversary release of it, how about something inside to read on the film?I did NOT care for the artwork on the front."
3,Special Edition Not So Special,"This is one of my all time favorite movies and I was very excited to see it released as a ""Special Edition"" DVD.Unfortunately, while it's still a GREAT story -- this version of the DVD really doesn't have that many whistles and bells. It gives you the option to have Harold Ramis (the director) do a voice over during the movie and it has a brief documentary about the concept behind the movie. Andie McDowell and the guy who plays ""Ned the Insurance Man"" were the only actors they got to speak about the making of this movie. It was very disappointing to have Bill Murray missing, or even Chris Elliot for that matter.One would think this movie had plenty of funny outakes -- but they are AWOL as well.Buy this DVD if you love the movie ""Groundhog Day"" -- but don't expect much in the way of extras."
5,It's A Wonderful Life -- upside down!,"Think about it: ""Groundhog Day"" and ""It's A Wonderful Life"" are actually the same film. They are both about appreciating the incredible gift of life. The only difference is that in IAWL everybody changes except Jimmy Stewart; in GD, everybody stays the same except Bill Murray. The moral: Only by learning to truly love others can we find happiness in our own lives. This is a zen movie. Harold Ramis -- you the man!"
5,Can't just watch this one once,This is a movie everyone can relate to. It's a story about life. A story about a man who has to find himself before he can escape into tomorrow. It makes you laugh and cry all at the same time. You can watch this movie a hundred times and still find things you missed before. Whether you have seen this movie or not you must own it.
3,Problems with Groundhog Day BluRay,BluRay disk would not play in my Sony BDP-S300. I spent 2 hours downloading and burning a CD of a Firmware update. Installing this firmware update allowed the BluRay disk to play. How many people could update the firmware with Sony's confusing instructions? How many would return the BluRay disc as defective?
1,Ground Hog Day,"Sound was completely distorted, such that the background sound overpowered the voices of the main characters - impossible to listen to."
2,Groundhog Day Blu Ray skips,Movie skipped during playing. Really disappointed. This is my husband's favorite movie and we were really looking forward to watching it.
1,Still Sucking After All These Years,"I've heard so many people say this movie is great over the years that I actually almost started to believe it. But this film is like Starship Troopers: you can succeed in telling yourself that it was good up until the point where you actually have to watch it again. I suppose it may have been the intention of the writers for the audience to experience Bill Murray's agony, but not quite to this degree.I like Bill Murray, the problem in this film is everyone else. They're two-dimensional morons, cardboard cutouts that float around delivering scripted lines to advance the increasingly rickety plotline. There's not a single believable character in this film. A small problem for a romantic comedy, considering it's not actually funny."
1,Spend your time seeing something else!,"Let me start by saying I'm a Bill Murray fan. I've been watching him since his great days on Saturday Night Live. With that said, this film has to be the worst I have seen during my stay on this planet! They took a good plot and slaughtered it. If the rating system allowed zero stars, I would have exercised it here. My wife and I watched this, dilly of dull, film together and could hardly keep our eyes open. This wasn't due to fatigue but rather the monotonous, monotone, stodgy way it DRAGGED on and on. As for the other reviewers who viewed this film more than once... I say, there's time lost you will NEVER get back. Get a life!"
1,Most boring Murray film ever,"I have always been a Bill Murray fan. This movie is dull, it goes beyond repetitious, and it gets so old after the second iteration, its not funny. The only benefit I can think of from watching this video is that it may dull your senses into slumber if you are an insomniac."
5,Groundhog Day is a classic,It was great seeing this movie again. This is probably Bill Murray's best movie. The theme is timeless and I'd recommend it to entire family. I especially enjoyed watching it a second time with the producer comments. There were a lot of facts about the movie that I didn't know. So get the Blue Ray version and enjoy.
5,Groundhog Day--a Classic!,We've loved this movie for years and wanted to purchase a DVD and get rid of our VHS copy. It's still a classic and great fun to watch!
5,Brilliant comedy!,"One of my favourite films. This has incredible one liners, great slapstick, Bill Murray at his best and a really strange but completely great premise behind the whole thing.Superb.Sherlock Holmes and the Flying Zombie Death Monkeys"
5,a profound comic parable,"I'd seen only bits and pieces of ""Groundhog Day"", and hadn't cared for it. Then I sat down yesterday and watched the whole thing.I was flabbergasted. This is a movie about the way we piss away our lives, day by day, never improving our own lives or the lives of those around us.Unhesitatingly recommended."
5,Murray at his best,"I will always have a special place in my heart for ""Groundhog Day"". it's not only one of my favorite movies of all time, but it was what started my true appreciation for the talent of Bill Murray. It's hard to imagine anyone else being able to pull off a movie like this, where he has to continuely relive the same day and situations again and again. His character of Phil the weatherman, in town to cover the annual Groundhog Day festival in Pa., goes from being an egomaniacal jerk, to a kind, sweet man...no longer doing good deeds just to impress his producer, Rita (McDowell), but because he wants to. The scene where Phil confesses his true feelings to a sleeping Rita, will always remain one of the sweetest, most touching romantic moments in film.The film works on every level, and was the first (but not last) great film of Bill Murray's career."
4,You can't go wrong with this one.,"I have to admit I do not own this particular DVD. Why? I have no idea. I should, because I stop and watch it whenever it's on TV. Then again, maybe that's why I don't own it. Well, whatever the reason, I can assure you of this, it is not because this is a bad movie. When this movie first came out I saw it twice. It has so many elements that are so perfectly suited for Murray and his comedic style. Since it's release it has been copied many, many times, but it has never been duplicated. What would you so if you had to relive the same day over and over. Would you use your knowledge to take advantage of the situation? Would you eventually go crazy? Or would you use the time to better yourself? Well, pick up this movie and see what Bill Murray did with it. You won't be sorry."
4,What goes around comes around,"I have to say, I did not particularly like this film on first viewing. However, watching it a couple more times, it has really grown on me. You pick up more each time you see it, and you also appreciate Bill Murray's excellent performance much more. Another hit from the much under-rated Harold Ramis!"
5,Champion! Absolutly champion!,"I have watched and loved Groundhog Day since it first came out on Video. I have since watched this classic of a movie at least 300 times. I have bought the script as well as the sound track, all for the best film of the century. Bill Murray is excellent as Phil the weather man who's life is transformed by nothiing changing, not even the day!! The film is an excellent comedy that will have you rolling in the isles!! A must see!!!"
4,Not a Bill Murry fan but learning to take advantage of what is dealt makes this well worth multiple viewings.,What would any of us do if we had the chance to live a day over? It took Bill multipe attempts to learn what life is about.
2,Wait for special edition!!!,"Brought this version thinking that it was soon to be released special edition. It was on the coming soon list. Turned out to be a reissue with RCE. Doh!!!Excellent film, lousy DVD."
5,Worth the wait.,"This movie starts out as any normal movie, but become quite monotonous throughout most of the movie, (which I'm sure was the director's intent) then has an awesome ending. ""Well worth the wait"" Be patient."
5,Classic,"An excellent movie! Bill Murray is wonderful! Quality is good but not excellent for Blu Ray, but streaming worked really well."
5,Wow - what a great film !!!,I can't believe this movie. I saw it years ago and did not get it. It's probably the most spiritual movie ever made. Incredible! See it! Think about it!
5,Great Movie for everyone! Will be a Classic!,"I saw this at the theater, on TV, and I plan to get the DVD soon because I'm wearing out the VHS version. It's very funny! The message behind it shows that even a jerk can change; only Phil Conners didn't have a choice in this movie! It's great to watch anytime, but fun in the winter, especially after the Christmas hubbub is overwith."
4,A Real Classic,"I've seen this movie numerous times and it's still funny and enjoyable to watch. We watched it on Groundhog Day along with our kids (who usually refuse to watch ""old"" movies) and everyone really enjoyed. Bill Murray is a perfect fit for this movie."
5,Really enjoyed this movie!,"I have frequently seen references to this movie in many places so I decided to finally see it. Well, my wife and I really enjoyed it! The acting is solid (maybe a touch exaggerated at times), the story cute, and the plot just plain imaginative with a real funny ending! A movie you should watch with family"
5,Bill Murray at his best,"One of my most watched and favourite comedies. I was interested to see some of the other reviews here that compare it to a Karmic journey - that opened my eyes a little.I must confess the fascination for me lies in wondering exactly how long it took him to learn everything he does in the course of that movie. How many times would *you* have to repeat the same day to turn it into the best possible day? How many lives would you try to save, how many people would you try to make happy? How many piano lessons would you take? Would it be an option in the ""real"" world or would you just go mad from boredom instead?Oh I also like to watch it because it is very funny!"
5,"The more you watch, the funnier it gets","This is one of those movies that I watched once and thought, ""Jeez, that was fun."" I watched it again with some friends and caught all sorts of extra things. Each time I watch it, it gets funnier and funnier!You have the take the whole thing as a fun campy movie. Bill Murray is great as his character goes from egocentric weatherman to caring individual. Sure, this bizarre timewarp just ""appears"". Sure, much of Bill's motivation to change is that he just wants to escape the warp, not that he (at least initially) really cares about the people he's helping. But it's all in fun, and the bizarre things that go on are hilarious.There isn't any great redemption in the movie, or mystic message ... it's simply a lot of fun to watch, to catch all the subtle ways things change as the day continually loops back into itself for Bill. If you ever feel like you're stuck in a rut, this is the perfect movie to help you laugh your way out!"
4,Good Transfer of a Comedy Classic,"This review is for the blu-ray transfer only, and not the film itself. I was pleased with the quality of this edition of Groundhog Day. Although this is not the type of film where hi-def makes that much difference, it nevertheless provided an enhanced viewing experience for someone who has seen this movie many times (my family typically watches it every year around Groundhog Day). It provided a fresh look at the film. If this is one of your favorite films, and you are considering an upgrade from DVD, I think it is worth it. Highly recommended."
1,One Of The Worst Movies Ever Made,"Although I admit I have not seen this film since its release in the theaters, it certainly ranks up near the top of the list of one of the WORST movies ever made. This is probably why I have not seen it since. I do love Bill Murray and think he is a great comedic actor. I actually enjoyed the movie until it went back to when he first wakes up in the morning. I did tolerate that once but when it kept repeating that, the movie went from a possible 5 all the way to 0. I rate it a 1 here because there is no lower number to choose. If you have never seen this movie, don't waste your time and money. If you have seen it and like it, please tell me why. You will not change my mind but maybe I can understand some how why you like it."
1,"Again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again","The only thing I have to say about this movie when I saw it the first and ONLY time is this... It was funny, and it was good, all the way up until it was Feb. 2 for the third time. It must've been Feb. 2 for about 30 days or so. It got old after a while. When I saw it in the theater, I actually got up and left the movie because I was tired of waiting to see the end. I never did find out, and I never will. The movie seemed like it was six hours long just because of the repetition. Please don't rent this if you get bored quick.~Natalie Kilpatrick"
4,Surefire humor,"This is one of the funniest films of the Nineties, in my opinion. Bill Murray perfectly captures a thoroughly dislikable, self-centered jerk whose soul is polished by having to re-live the same day over and over till he gets it right. In the process, the vignettes of his sometimes clumsy efforts are hysterical. A wonderful collection of one-liners, too."
4,Enjoyable romantic comedy.,"The movie is about a tv reporter(B.Murray) who lives literally the same day over and over again. Finally at the end, he finds his way out of it(with the love of A.Macdowell). I definitely suggest everyone to see it, it is an enjoyable movie."
5,One of my favorite films.,"This is a sweet, fun, & surprisingly good film. It explores the idea of time repeating itself better than some stories from Asimov's. However it's a romantic comedy technically. It is rare that a movie can e touching & laugh out loud funny, but this manages it without seeming manic depressive. (Unlike that casper movie which is one of the most manic depressive films I've ever seen. I mention that to show it's not so easy to get the right balance.) This definitely gets my ""Best holiday movie for stupidest holiday award"" in fact it has little competition on that score. This movie is so good it actually makes me look forward to Groundhog day."
4,What vain weathercocks are we...,"When I first saw this movie, I could only think that it was incredibly stupid, but the second time, I saw that there is a very important message.As the vain, conceited, ill-tempered and mean spirited weatherman, Phil Connors (played by Bill Murray) is forced to live each life day after day, in a type of private hell, we see how there is a spiritual message here.We are all here to learn lessons and our dilemmas will continue to be repeated until we rectify our mistakes.In a sense the same theme as the Scrooge story. Bill Murray was also superb in `Scrooged'!A superb performance by Andie McDowell as the movie's leading lady."
5,Watch this over and over!,"This is a great movie. Bill Murray at his funniest. And this new and improved DVD is a treat! The first one was a ""bare-bones"" edition, with no special features. This one is nowhere near the calibur of the latest & greatest DVD's (Moulin Rouge, Episode I) as far as extra features go, but there is a great half-hour retrospective documentary featuring all the major players in this film except Bill Murray. This movie was also one of the greatest romantic comedies (or pure comedies) of the past decade. Bill Murray is dead-on as the weatherman who fancies himself a big-time talent and celebrity who gets stuck in a town because of a blizzard, only to be stuck there repeating the same day for seemingly forever. I felt this movie did a great job exploring the progression of how a person would first exploit that type of situation, then get depressed by it, then accept it. I definitely recommend this movie."
5,My Favorite Movie,"This is one of those movies that people either really like, or really dislike. I'm one of the former. Bill Murray is hilarious, and easy for work-stressed boomers to identify with. This movie made me fall in love with Andie McDowell -- unfortunately she just got hitched. If you like Bill Murray, you should also check out Rushmore."
5,One of my most favorite movies!,Could watch this movie over & over & over again and never get tired of it. It is my husband's & mine must see on Groundhog Day.
5,Awakening to the Fourth Way,"Bhikkus, awaken to the redundancy that is your life. This movie challenges you to break out of the negative sleep that you live your lives in. Yes this movie is funny, but do you know what it means? Check out The Fourth Way schools, Gurdjieff,Ouspensky, etc. It will change your life."
3,MURRAY IS STILL HILARIOUS!,"I saw this movie when it first came out on video and couldn't stop watching it. I think my total count has come to over 15 times! This is a really good movie to watch for Groundhog Day, don't miss it."
2,NOT 1.85:1,"I love this movie, but not this blu-ray release. This dishonest labeling is an on-going problem with DVDs. The package lists the aspect ratio (width-to-height) as 1.85:1 (or greater), but when you play the disc, the only choice is 1.77:1 (16x9). To coin a phrase, this is not rocket science. Tell the customer what they are actually buying. Normally, this is a problem with Warner discs. This one is from Columbia. The stupidity spreads."
4,Nice,Definately a movie worth seeing over and over again. Bill Murray is funnier than ever. And with a great supporting cast this movie definately takes off to new heights.
5,"Scrooge? Bailey? No, Connor.","It's the chance we'd all like and never get. Finally, an opportunity to do it all again and not screw up. And so in ""Groundhog Day"" Phil Connor (Bill Murray) gets the chance--and blows it. Then gets it again, and blows it again. And on we all go on a wild excursion from delightful comedy to the darkest recesses of the human soul. Sure it's been done. Scrooge took an equally dark ride though his past in an attempt to reclaim his soul; and George Bailey was given the opportunity to view the world without him. ""Groundhog Day"" isn't better, but it's damned good. What's more, Scrooge was s-o-o-o very evil, and George Bailey was s-o-o-o very good. Phil Connor is Everyman.It takes him many mornings of waking up to ""I Got You, Babe"" to learn life: The rest of us get that one morning only. We better not blow it."
5,Mini-Course in Buddhism!,"I loved this movie which was, in my opinion, a mini-course in Buddhism. For ""day"" read ""lifetimes"" as Phil is reincarnated again and again until he has learned his lessons and, through the giving and receiving of healing love, is freed from further incarnations. Great acting, great screenplay, great fun!"
4,It's a classic,I introduced my 12 yr old to this on ground hog day. I forgot how funny it is - great laughs.
5,A Christmas Carol for Groundhog day,A warm hilarious story of human weakness and redemption. It has become a tradition at my home to watch this movie in celebration of Groundhog Day every February second.
5,Groundhog Day,"I love this movie!! I've seen this numerous times on TV, but I thought it was time to get my own non-edited version."
4,"over and over,better and better","This is a really good film,for two reasons.one - its not the norm,its nice to have a little change when watching a lot of films and this is certainly different.two - bill murray,sometimes i think i dont like him,but when i watch him ,i realise that he is great at the parts he plays.A film about a insensitive,mean man,who has a bad day(inflicted by himself),and has to relive it until he gets it right.it takes a long time.Watch bill learn to play the piano,jump off buildings,make friends,and find love.Definately see it."
4,A fun movie,"The premise of this movie is pretty basic. An arrogant TV reporter is trapped, reliving one day over and over. He's the only one who knows it; everyone else starts each day as if it's the first time.What makes it so fun is the way that this idea is developed. The movie is clever in exploiting the possibilities of the scenario. It's funny, and also warm in that we enjoy watching the development of the character through his experiences.The DVD version is well-done, but doesn't add much in the way of bonus material."
5,GREAT FOR THE FAMILY,GROUNDHOG DAY IS A TERRIFIC MOVIE TO WATCH WITH YOUR CHILDREN. BILL MURRAY IS AT HIS BEST. WE HAVE BEEN WATCHING THIS MOVIE FOR THE LAST FOUR YEARS ON GROUNDHOG'S DAY. MY 11 YEAR OLD AND 8 YEAR OLD THINK IT'S GREAT. THIS YEAR MY 77 YEAR OLD MOTHER JOINED US. SHE LOVED IT TOO.
4,A note about the DVD...,"One of my favorite movies - but not enhanced by being on DVD. The only additional material provided is the original theatrical trailer. What? No interview with Bill Murray, Andie McDowell, Chris Elliot? No commentary by Harold Ramis? These opportunites were sadly missed."
3,Good comedy gets old toward the end,"The repeating time loop, in which one experiences the same period of time indefinitely, is a familiar concept to science-fiction fans. It provides fertile ground for a romantic comedy as well. Bill Murray is a self-important weatherman who finds himself reliving Groundhog Day. He goes through a number of stages, from disbelief through near-insanity to a calm acceptance, growing as a person along the way. As much as I liked the concept and Bill Murray's performance, I found myself growing bored toward the end of the film. Of course, repetition is unavoidable in a film of this type. Indeed, it is the whole point of the movie. Nevertheless, the filmmakers needed to make the repetition seem a little less...well, repetitious. I still give it three stars, but screenwriter Danny Rubin and director Harold Ramis needed to find more for the actors to do."
2,I'm hoping to replace it with better,"I had an old thrift store pastry blender that I used for years until only half the blades were left. We tend to go through a batch of Master Mix a week in our home, so I needed another functional pastry blender. The only one I could find in the local stores was this Good Cook wire pastry blender. It functions, barely. It does ok on room temperature shortening, but bends all over the place when I try to use it on cold butter. The way the wires bend, I keep thinking they're going to break, but they haven't yet. After a year though, it's reached the point where I have to slice the butter a bit with a knife before taking the mangled wires to it in my mix. Also, the little tabs on the handle have started popping out at random times when I'm mixing. They pop right back in without a problem, but it is a minor annoyance. Basically, the pastry blender is faster than working with just a couple knives, but it's time to replace it with a better model."
3,Can't seem to get all of my order still waiting on my Cubeb pepper!,Its been about a month and a half. I made the order on aug 6th of 2008 I received 1pd long pepper but never received the 1pd cubeb pepper. I would like to get my money back or the cubeb pepper. I can't seem to get anyone that can help me here. I'm beginning to believe that I've been scammed. some one owes me 16.99 or the cubeb pepper.
4,Waiting for Volume II,"I think this was a good read. Just not sure how many of Snoop Dogg ""rap followers"" actually read this book. Non-followers may think it is not a book of their class - too thugged out. I guess this is why I found this book in the bookstore, hardcover, for $5. If marketing would have gone into it, it would easily have become a bestseller. The book is definitely a good easy read and at times, funny as HECK! I loved the characters, especially, sweet Bing, and I could flow with it. I'm just wondering, because, perhaps, of the low sales of this 1st volume, will another come out? The end of the book leaves you hanging. Come on Snoop, at least give the characters a good ending!"
4,Alot better than I thought it would be,I picked this book up at work one day when a co-worker left it on their desk. I read the whole book in one shift. Its a easy read and the end leaves you wanting more.
3,Doggy Dog World,"This book was a quick read, you learn about Ulysses's life living poor with his mother and borther in Long Beach, California. Ulysses looks up to a local pusher and starts selling drugs at and young age. He watches his mother struggle just to get by, He wants to help but don't know how, he has dream of being a rapper but must first learn how to survive. This is Vol. 1 of the Doggy Tales so I must know what will be next."
4,Keep moving,The book is quite interesting and quick reading. I wonder if the youth of the hip-hop generation will read the book and wonder if this the route they really want to go. There will always be struggles in life which is displayed in the story but it is what you do about it. Do you move in a positive mode or let the situation keep you down and move in negative mode?I am looking forward to reading more by Snoop Dogg& David E. Talbert.
3,You Get What You Pay For,1. The 8 lessons are a progression of a few exchanges between a man and a woman. These exchanges are basic greetings.2. The few exchanges are maybe a total of 10 sentences3. A travel guide reference book would be helpful enough if you are just going to travel. English is the Lingua Franca of the world.4. Although this method used is essential you need to be able to read and write the language. Someone who is serious about learning the language will find this worth only about what you paid for it.5. No grammar is taught.6. The lessons assume you are going to be alone if traveling.7. Do your research when buying language instruction. There is no short cut.
2,Greek: Learn to Speek & Understand Greek,"Pronunciations not always clear, especially the female on the disc. Not as helpful as I had hoped."
3,Volcano Island,Not enough action! My kids are use to Nicktoons being a game they can team up and play. They loved Nicktoons Unite for the PS2 but Volcano Island didn't live up to it.
2,Champion?,"She's not a champion yet. (Dec 2006). She will be someday, but to release a book with this title prior to her winning anything smacks of arrogance."
5,Bidex Rotary Trimmer - Hard to find!,"As always, Amazon came to the rescue. We surfed high and low and could not find these specific rotary trimmers for our paper cutter. They are just what we needed. Buy with confidence!"
1,Get the Theo Adam studio recording,"Wonderful opera, unlistenable live performance. A comic opera that's actually funny-what a concept! Get the Theo Adam studio recording and apply a little imagination where required."
1,Noisy as all get out,"My wife bought this mobile for our newborn baby. Assembly was relatively easy and it looks nice but once we turned it on we were horrified! The rotating mechanism makes an awful grinding/clacking sound as it turns! I don't know if this is just a bad unit, or if this is a 'normal' sound but this clearly wont do. Back to the store with this puppy! Several other reviewers have mentioned similar problems so they've either got quality control issues at the factory or some peoples notions of 'soothing' are diametrically opposed to mine."
1,Would not work out of the box,"Put the thing together, installed the batteries, turned it on and nothing. Re-checked the batteries. Still nothing. Batteries work in other toys. Nice work on design guys..."
2,OKAY,Too annoying the baby gets way too excited and can't go to sleep. I did not like the songs recorded.
3,Nice feature with so so quality,"OK, I have to admit that my son likes it. For the feature part I'd give this mobile a 5 star.HOWEVER, there's something scary about it: the melody turns on by itself at random times! This happened to me at least 10 times during 5 months. At the beginning it was funny but when it happened in the middle of dark night it's not so pleasant experience.Also the other drawback I think is that it eats up battery too fast! We use it at most 1 hour a day and have to replace the battery every month. Even a cradle swing, which does much more than a mobile, could last at least 3 months on the same amount of battery.Overall, the idea of this mobile may be great, but to make it worth the money, someone in the company has to redesign the circuit to make it more reliable and more efficient. It'd be a really simple circuitry problem anyway."
3,upset,"My daughter loves this mobile since her birth and up untill now,she's almost 5 months old. However, it broke when she just turned 3 months and i cannot seem to find a replacement part for it and don't want to purchase the same one just for few more months. The same problem happened the mobile stopped spinning, instead it stocks at some point and clicking without spinning, however we still use it just like that, since music is playing just fine and lights is working fine as well. the clicking sound is pretty annoying though...In other words if this toy would be a better quality it would be a wonderful toy, babies love it."
3,Cute but gets jammed,"This mobile is very cute,and is one of the few with lights, which is what my 5 month old son likes best about it. The songs are soothing, and it's nice to have a few to choose from so you don't get sick of listening to them.The problem I have is that it had a problem with getting jammed since the day I bought it. We keep tightening the screws, and it will work for a few days, but then start jamming up again. When it jams it makes a really irritating clicking sound, which is definitely not soothing!"
5,Great Mobile - My 2 month old loves it!,"My 2 Month-Old daughter recieved this as a Christmas gift from her grandmother. We have it attached to her wooden cradle in our bedroom. It is a bit big, but we can swing the arm with the spinning canopy to either side when we take her in or out of the cradle. This is also a nice feature when we want to position the mobile over her, so it doesnt matter where we lay her down, she always has a great view. She enjoys watching the animals rotating, and the the light show also. The music is pleasant, and calming. It is nice that this mobile is battery powered. No winding it up every time. And the remote is great when you need to start it again, but don't want baby to see you!"
5,wonder mobile,I purchased as a gift to my niece. I have same that I received for my baby. It is the most wonderful remote control mobile. All mothers can understand how nice is not to get up from the bed to turn mobile on.
1,What a waste,"I too was very excited about this mobile when I bought it. My daughter would wake up from her naps and start it herself. Once the first set of batteries went bad, it seemed that each set seemed to drain faster and faster. Not to mention it's 4 D batteries. It's also a big pain to change the batteries. Lastly, once I got over the fact that the batteries were only lasting a week, it keeps getting stuck. It just stops turning and you can hear a ""click, click, click"" through the house. It never starts up again until you physically go in and push it. I am soooo unhappy with this purchase."
2,My son doesn't like this one,"We had a manual mobile and my son loves it so much. I am bored of turning it on all the time so bought this electronic one. But unfortunately my son won't look at it at all, just crying when i leave him on the crib and turn on this mobile. Expecially when I turned on both of the mobiles, my son only smile at the manual one. I don't know why. Maybe the creatures he doesn't like."
2,wish my kid wasn't attached to this...,"this is a very cute mobile and i read the reviews about it - many people mentioned how frequently they had to change the batteries, but i thought, 'how bad can it be?' well, although it is cute, it is such a pain to have to frequently change the ""D"" batteries - maybe once every three weeks or so. kind of expensive to buy all of those batteries too. my son does seem to love it though. he watches it as he falls asleep and now can turn it on by kicking the buttons himself - that could be part of the reason my batteries are dying so quickly but i can't stop him from doing that! so, although it is a neat concept, i wish i hadn't purchased this one!"
2,Problems all-around,"While this mobile is cute, and in theory should be great, we've had a lot of problems with The First Years during this whole thing. Our mobile arrived, new and straight from the box, with the projection unit not working. They recommended trying a new bulb (don't get me started-this is a NEW product), but we couldn't find the bulb in any stores. When I requested they let me know where to buy one or that they send me a new one, they told me to just send the whole thing back. It was already assembled, and my baby was using it. The customer service was awful. Plus, the motor does make a loud noise, though I think of it as a free ""white noise"" machine!"
1,bad luck with THREE of these in the past month,"I have had horrible luck with this mobile. I have tried to use three of them in the past month, and something is defective with each one.The first one stopped rotating after the first night of use. I returned that one to Toys R Us and got another one.The next one drained the batteries dead overnight after the first night of use, even though I only used the mobile for a couple of hours.After that, I called the company (The First Years/Learning Curve). They offered to replace the mobile if I paid to send in the defective one and my store receipt. I paid $20 (!!!) to send it to them, and they sent a replacement right back. The motor buzzes loudly when the canopy rotates, to the point that it's really annoying, not soothing.Now I am out $60 and still don't have a product I can use. I am very, very disappointed and feel like I've had rotten luck. This leaves a bad taste in my mouth toward this company."
4,it takes an automotive lightbulb,Just wanted to let previous reviewers know that if the light bulb burns out it takes a 4.8 bolt .5 amp light bulb. :)
1,I wish it worked for more than two weeks! Too bad.,"I received this off my registry and I was thrilled with it for the two weeks. The music was soothing and the projection screen was great. Unfortunately, one day it just stopped working. I figured the batteries had run out so I changed them. It worked fine for a day and then stopped working again. I tried a third time (with a different brand of batteries) and again it only worked for a day or so. Very frustrating. I ended up just buying a new mobile (Fisher Price Precious Planet) and it's been working great. It's not as cute as the Dreams-In-Sight but it's dependable and it doesn't burn through batteries."
1,battery drainer,"I came on this website to find if anyone else had the same problem i have had with this mobile. The situation with the batteries being drained in a day is exactly right. This mobile stinks. I went through numerous batteries, including rechargeables, and NiMh. This mobile drained the batteries like crazy. Horrible mobile. I will never recommend this."
5,Buy this!,"We love this mobile! This is the nicest mobile I have ever owned/seen. My son loves to stare at it, and it even helps him to fall back to sleep. I wish I had this mobile 4 years ago when my daughter was born!"
2,"Noisy, Noisy, Noisy","All the problems we experienced with this mobile were listed in others reviews.It turns on and off if you use a remote control near it.The canopy was so loud during rotation that we decided to return it.I found that it went through batteries quickly.When we attached it to the crib, we found that it damaged the finish.When completely assembled it does not have a music only function which I found that we would have really liked. When you remove the mobile, you could use it as a music only, but it looks strange with our the arm and canopy.The canopy on our mobile was really hard to snap in place especially the last piece.My baby does like it, but its so noisy that I can't use it to lull her back to sleep, it only works when she is awake otherwise it keeps her up.I am on the look out for a better option."
5,Awesome,"We originally bought a mobile that matched our bedding. It did not take long before the songs became intolerable. A friend recommended this one, and it has worked out perfectly. The music is by Bach with a nursery feel. The nighttime setting is great. Our little girl loves it - put her to sleep quickly. I highly recommend this product."
2,"IT LOOKS REALLY OLD, AND WAS BROKE","SINCE THE FIRST MOMENT THAT I TAKE IT OUT OF BOX I WAS WONDERING IF IT WAS USED OR NEW, MAKE A TERRIBLE NOISE WHEN IT START AND, THE CONTROL REMOTE WAS BROKE BUT WAS NOT A BIG DEAL BECAUSE EVERY TIME THAT I TURN ON THE TV, THE MOBILE START, AND ALSO IT DOESN`T LOOK LIKE IN THE PICTURES"
3,"Was great, until...","So, I got this mobile for my shower after reading reviews. I loved it, my son loved it. It was so adorable and kept him engaged and happy in his crib, which was great because he otherwise hated being in the crib. As most of these toys do, the batteries eventually died and it was time to change them. The battery changing was fine, but as soon as I put it back onto my LO's crib, all of a sudden the mobile didn't spin anymore. Music played, lights went on, but it just didn't move at all!! What is the point????So, if this hadn't happened I would have given this 5 stars, but I can't seem to figure out how to fix this problem and now it's rather pointless. My son still likes it because of the music and the lights (at night), but he no longer coos at the little stuffed characters going around.has anyone else had this issue? Is there a solution?? It seems like the motor that turns it just died."
5,sharing the beautiful,"really blown away by the album.. kundalini yoga is not just someone explaining poses..it is a link through the teacher to the infinite.. and a beautiful album is not just a person playing muscial notes.. i felt sada sats life, her commitment, her love coming through the beautiful songs...I played most of it in a class the past few weeks.( i teach yoga). the ajai alai for opening the class and the adi manta being a emerging favorite song ... music is a pathway sada sat can share her love through....i'll have to look at the album to remember, but there are songs that she has some guest singers on and i love that.. it really feels like people joining in to expand the feeling that is unfolding , and it makes me want to sing along even more..i talked about sada sat and her music at a workshop on success.. explaining how she is building a new home/center and creates time to make an album.. very inspiring artist and human being..."
3,Ok but not essential,Back in the late sixties n.j. schools would have things called dances where local bands would play cover material by the same bands covered here. And local unsung heroes Blue Underground would do them even better! Hearing these guys I get the impression they are trying to mimic their heroes which ultimately has to fail. For real psychedelic music Vincebus Eruptum or Electric Music for the Mind and Body by Country Joe and the fish are far more essential. For completists only.
5,Great Price,"Usually Monster equipment is pretty expensive but this was on sale so I went for it. It works great. I used it for a recording interface which is a non traditional way of using it. However, It worked very well no glitches no audio artifacts at all. It is optical fiber so you really cant tell by ear the difference between a cheap cable and an expensive one. I went for the safer route and decided to stick with a credible name and brand. Well worth it."
2,Doesn't worth it,"I was expecting a little bit more quality for this flatware set,but the plastic feeling of the handle was a little cheap.Also the packaging was very bad, the small wood blocks that holdthe knifes and forks got off, the box became totally useless."
2,Not as I expected,"Though the design is cool, the quality of this earrings set is poor. They are so light and the color is strikingly white, which makes them appear cheaper. I also bought the pendant with the same design and I'm so disappointed with both. :-(I suggest that amazon collection makes white gold of a good quality with the similar design."
2,Very heavy,"Be aware, these are actually fairly heavy earrings. I find I can't wear them often without discomfort."
5,Great value,I am very pleased with these earrings. They are a great quality at this price. I would also recommend the matching pendant. Great set!!
2,pumps good (if you tolerate the noise!),"This review is easy to write:- pumps bubbles good- 'whisper' is misleading, because these pumps are very buzzy, noisy.I have 3- 27 gallon aquariums and 3 Whisper pumps. They are all the same, with the same noise problem. I am thinking of finding something less noisy and tossing these in the trash.My advice to the consumer is not to buy 'Whisper' pumps.Ask to try one out in the store - guess why they won't let you?"
1,Annoying Humming,I ordered the Tetra 40 gallon pump after reading a lot of the reviews. There were a lot of pros and cons on the amount of noise it made or did not make. I hooked mine up and immdiately noticed an unacceptably loud humming noise coming from the pump. The humming was so loud I could hear it down the hallway and from adjoining rooms. I let it run for about 48 hours hoping the noise would tone down after it was broken in which did not happen. The good news is that Amazon is crediting my account after I sent them an email. This is the first of many things I have ordered from Amazon and the only one where I had a problem and had to request a refund. I don't know if I just got a defective pump or what. I will say Amazon's price was the best I found. Shopping locally I found the same pump in pet stores was selling for over twice what I paid at Amazon.
2,It has a low hum,It is quiet not ultra quiet. I want a pump you don't hear. We had one 40 years ago when I was a kid back in Dallas. I just turned this one on and now I am shopping for a completely quiet one for I can replace it.
3,Power pressure but not whisper quiet,"I think that this is a well priced product, but it fails to meet my standards as a pump. I have some off brand 10 gallon pump and this ""whisper quiet"" pump is about 3 times as loud as it. I believe that this is an ancient model pulled off some warehouse self. It's from 2004, and I'm positive that they have come out with a newer model. Either that or this is a complete rip off from some other company. The box seems fishy and the pump itself is much darker than the ones you get at the store. However, the pump does seem to work. I was just very disappointed in the loudness of it. I think that there is the newer model for sale on Amazon too... and this one is only 1 or 2 dollars more. If I would have known there would be such a difference, I would have purchased the latter for sure. Hope this helps."
3,uninformed,"the pump may have been a great pump but it was made for 110 volts and we use 240volts here so needless to say it didnt last long, its a pitty the pumps arent supplied to suit the country they are going to,or at least inform the buyer by email that the pump wouldnt suit !"
4,"Excellent... a little noise to be expected, easily corrected.","As with most air pumps, there is a little humming noise to be expected, and this whisper isn't the best in the crowd. But I placed it on a fabric place-mat and the hum toned down to an absolute minimum. I keep this in the living room and it doesn't affect any audio. I have the hose split into three different stones in my 37gal tank and it works great. The noise is substantially louder when you turn it up, but for simple aeration, it works great."
2,ehh,"Its an alright air pump for what they charged , some $12.99 . So far its been running just shy of three months wit no real problems, only it does seem to have gott'n a bit noisier since i first plugged it in , but over all its pretty good . As long as it doesn't get any noisier, any noisier and it'll drive a fellow mad."
2,"Pushes a lot of air, and really really noisy","""Whisper"" is a strange name to choose for this pump, because it sounds more like a mini-jackhammer. Almost immediately after I began using it, the thing went from reasonably quiet to obnoxiously loud. I opened it up and found that the magnet used inside to create the pumping motion was poorly attached to its metal arm. I used some aquarium silicone to better fasten it and dampen vibration. That helped, but I've found since then that it's gotten noisy again and I haven't been able to fix it, this time. So, the pump does move air, but not quietly."
1,broke in a few days,"After a few days it made a constant loud insane noise. I tried tapping it moving it, etc. Never buying from this company again."
1,Piece of junk,"Worked great at first, slowly started to die over time, after 4 or 5 months it completely stopped functioning. They don't make anything like they used too I guess."
2,"worked well, until it broke","I've owned this air pump for about 4 months now and tonight it died. It started making a really loud rattle, so I unscrewed its case and found that a cheap piece of plastic was holding the vibration mechanism and this piece had broken and so the vibrator was rattling all over. Basically it's now trash. Pretty pathetic that this thing died so fast, it's clearly built cheaply inside. It's almost as if it's designed to fail. The broken part is very obviously in need of reinforcement."
3,Just OK,Titania beard scissors are the right size for a man's hand. I thought I was paying more to upgrade from the scissors that came out of a bargain-priced set but those cheap-o scissors were much sharper. Not recommended.
2,Disaapointing,"Very disappointing, but from such a wide genre not all can be to everyone's tastes. It seems to be mass produced buy beginning writers."
3,"Relevance, please","I would say that only 2 or 3 of the stories were for the alternate history fan, where the difference in the story would be a large visible difference in the world today. Maybe the other stories needed a blurb on what actually happened for a better appreciation by readers with a lack of knowledge of that person or event."
3,"Interesting, but not great","Alternate history is a funny thing... when it is good, it can be some of the most compelling fiction ever printed, but when it is bad it can well and truly stink up an entire room.Alternate Generals 2 falls somewhere in the middle.Some of the stories are interesting, particularly the one based on the premise of a Buonaparte empire in the new world. Others weren't nearly as good.Spend a short time with this book and you will have spent a tolerable afternoon, but only if you didn't plunk down 25 dollars for it."
2,Not what I was looking for.,"Not only are the stories of only fair to midlelin quality, many have little or nothing to do with military history much less Generals. The stories in this volume are of lesser quality of the first book but are still interesting to read. The only thing the have in common is that they are alternate history and some kind of military connection. My recommendation is wait for the paperback."
3,Very slow,"with the exception of""Southern Strategy"",""George Patton Slept here""""American mandiate""Which are excellent. I think all of these stories suffered froma total lack of drive and focus. It wasn't that the est were bad its just that the rest aren't the kind of stories that you want to read twice."
5,"I give this a top review based on 1 story,Southern Strategy","There are a number of good stories here, however it is worth the money just for Southern Strategy. The brilliance of Richard Nixon is truly revealed and how the nation is saved from foreign domination and occupation. Of course Tricky Dick has the help of two other truly great American, Dutch Reagan and Elvis. Would love to see sequels like Nixon as president a full eight years, Reagan president for eight more years, and a constitutional change letting Elvis serve twelve to sixteen years. Wow, what a wonderful and beautiful vision! Lefties out there won't like the story or my review. Too bad."
5,Beautiful Malawi Chair,"I just love my daughter's new malawi chair and must share the good new's with all of you.Today I went to my local Babies R Us store and to my surprise I found this new chair in the Malawi line. I must say I purchased the entire Malawi line since finding out we were having a baby girl..Our daughter is now nine months old and her nursery look's so beautiful. The malawi chair follows the same pattern look's great, the quality is exceptional and price perfect...I also purchased the Malawi toy chest today with the chair and now my daughter's nursery is complete.Well happy shopping to all and please don't pass up this chair you will love it......"
4,Not perfect but pretty good,"We bought this chair 6 months ago when my son was 14 months old. He absolutely loves this chair and uses it constantly. He's all boy and climbs all over this chair and it has held up pretty well. My only complaint is the fabric has ""balled up"" and has little pills in the areas that are used often. It has gotten stained badly but I used something I got at PetSmart called Simple Solution and it cleaned the chair right up, then I used Scotchguard and it looks much better. I got rid of the pills swith a razor. All in all, I would buy it again, just Scotchgusrd it immediately."
2,CUTE...but THIN FABRIC and COLOR WEARS AWAY EASILY!,"We purchased this darling chair for our 18-month old son. He loved it immediately, climbing into it and naming each of the animals on the chair. Since his room is done in the Malawi theme, this chair was a delightful addition. Sadly, he got just a smudge of dirt on it. When I tried to clean it by dabbing it with water (just dabbing...not rubbing, as I had read others' advice against rubbing), the green color fabic faded badly right away. This was just with a dab of water! So we returned the chair (amazon was great about this!) and got a second one. The second one had a small rip in the arm upon delivery. So we have returned it and are awaiting a third chair. Hopefully the third time will be the charm, because this chair really is CUTE! But if there's something wrong with #3, then we will give up on the Malawi chair and buy something else. So sad."
2,How Unfortunate,This chair is cute and is the perfect size. Unfortunately the fabric is very thin. The first chair we received had a small tear in the left arm. We decided to return it and get a replacement. The second chair had a tear in the fabric of the right arm. We e-mailed the customer service department and asked their opinion on wether to exchange or get a refund. They replied that the problem was more widespread than they originally thought an we should just get a refund. I guess we will look elsewhere.
2,COLOR RUBBS OFF,"My son LOVED this chair. However as time went on, as CRAZY as it may seem, my toddler got some scuff marks on it. When I wiped it down, the color came RIGHT OFF! Spend your money elsewhere, your child will enjoy a durable chair just the same."
1,Nice looking but cheaply made,"We recieved this as a gift, as it matched our sons nursery. As the months went by, my son loved to sit on the chair. With just the little interaction that any 1 year old would do, this chair has completly fallen appart, exposing the nails and is just completely out of its original shape. It now takes up space in the garbage dump.I feel that this chair should have lasted more than 8 months."
4,EXCELLENT guide for the DSST Criminal Justice & Law Enforcement,"I'm not sure why there hasn't been a review on this book yet, but this book is awesome if you're preparing for the DSST tests. I studied for about a day, took both tests back to back, and got A's on both of them. Just make sure that you know:1. All of the important Supreme Court decisions (such as Mapp v. Ohio, Gideon v. Wainwright),2. How criminal and juvenile courts work, (their procedures, etc)3. The 4th, 5th, and 6th & 14th amendments to the Constitution4. Everything related to the development of the American police force & crime statisticsThe only thing that is missing that you would need outside of the cliffsnotes book is current information on police dept's hiring statistics on minorities and women. At least 4 of the questions on law enforcement test were related to that subject."
1,STINK,"It is not that awesome armonic, choral type of music. It is just russian music played in a ""gypsy"" way. The style stinks. I do regret I bought-it. My rate is ""1 star"" because the is minimum! Again... stinks!"
1,Dissapointed,"I ordered this product and when I went to listen to the cassette, it did not play because the tape in it was broken.I have not received my refund yet either. What is the holdup?"
4,Darkwave in a Dark Age,"Along with Kiss to the Brain, Lactating Purple is one of Creed's finest albums. The insert photo of the mutant from the old Outer Limits television show really says it all. Lactating Purple is like some strange alien mutation of punk, psychedelia, heavy metal, and electronic music; in other words, space-rock for a new degeneration. The song titles (""Big Bang,"" ""The Radiated,"" ""Martian Bagpipes and Sperm"")are appropriately warped. A must-have for any fan of Creed or, for that matter, Creed's earlier band, Chrome."
2,disappointed by the 5th edition,"To my surprise, there are lots of chapters are quoted as a whole chapters from another books, the editor-in-chief should had known this. When you submit a paper to a certain journal, you had been asked to be original by never being a part of other journal,so why not as the Bible of our loving Youman's series."
1,Plastic and Flimsy,"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!It is plastic and flimsy, mine only lasted a little over a month before it fell apart. In the pictures it looks like it is metal it is really just plastic though.For me the charging became an off and on issue after 2 weeks then it sort of just fell apart, the keyboard keys came right off. I was very unhappy with this product and I would not recommend it to any of my friends, maybe my enemies, this product is so bad I would not even give it to my enemies."
1,Metalic coating on mouse wears off in less than 3 month of regular use,"I like the fact that the keyboard can be recharged and used also while charging, but the materials used to what's meant to be a high-end mice and keyboard set are just so low-end.The metallic-like color on the mouse started to wear off just after 2 months of use. I've notices that the aluminium silver color was getting darker the side where I lay down my palm and in addition to that after a while the ""Microsoft"" turned into ""Micros"".Needless to note that as a guy I don't use any creams or wear parfume on my hands. And I've been using only a microfibre towel for cleaning any dirt - no detergents at all."
3,Microsoft Keyboard and Mouse 8000,Keyboard and Mouse are laid out exceptionally well. Only drawbacks are the rather high price and the space bar function. You need to hit the bar in the center or it will not work. Hitting it on either end only leaves you with the worlds longest words.
2,Flaky and broke down after 3 months,"Pros:very comfortable keys and layout, backlit keys.Cons:After first few weeks started having problems with charging the mouse (poor contacts resulting in constant blinking red light), had to position the mouse EXACTLY right on the charging pins.Left shift key broke after 3 months of use (I do a fair bit of typing but I am not a writer or a coder or anything like that).Overall I do not think this is a good value for the price."
2,Poor quality,"How long has Microsoft been in the business? Within three weeks the Microsoft label rubbed off of the mouse, and now I've noticed that the lettering on the key caps are rubbing off. Given the price, one would have expected the lettering to have been embedded in the plastic not just painted on the surface. Typical for Microsoft -- mile wide and an inch deep.Also, note that if you have to reboot your computer because of a windows crash, the keyboard and mouse are useless because they require that bluetooth is running. So all of the keystrokes and mouse selections necessary to reboot can't be entered unless, of course, you connect a USB-based keyboard or one that plugs into the mouse and keyboard ports."
3,NO NUMERIC KEYPAD,"This is a very slick looking keyboard & mouse combo. I was a little concerned that it did not appear to be as ergo friendly as some of the other Microsoft keyboards, but went ahead and ordered it. I completely failed to notice one thing critical for our business needs... NO NUMERIC KEYPAD. Ouch! You can use a function key combo to convert the letters to simulate a keypad, but this is a hastle. Could add a wireless keypad, but just one more item on desktop... which gets away from the slick look of this $200+ combo. This is very cool looking and probably would be great with a home entertainment system, but not good for our small business. Other businesses that are not number intense... graphic businesses perhaps... would probably love the style. I'm sending mine back and ordering the Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Desktop 7000 ."
3,Not Worth It,Very nice keyboard. The Bluetooth works well. I don't like the fact that it doesn't have a number pad. My biggest complaint is the price! A lot of money for a keyboard. I returned it.
2,"Too much explanation, not enough story","eBook downloaded free from Gutenberg. In 1865 San Francisco, a sheltered young lady witnesses a murder but falls for the gentleman killer.Nothing about this grabbed me. Chamberlain spent so much time explaining her heroine that there wasn't much storyline, and I simply didn't find the girl interesting. I gave up about a quarter of the way through and never found anything relevant to the title."
5,Great album!,"To Whom It May Concern, It seems like there are good albums, excellent albums and then truly inspired albums. ""Hyperacuity"" is truly an inspired album. I highly recommend it for any fusion lover! There is not one mediocre cut on the album. Sincerely! G Shreeve"
3,didn't like it,"I've bought almost every one of Greg's albums, and, although this one seemed a sigh of relief after the neo-classical laden ""Ascend"", I still didn't really like ""Hyperacuity"". In fact I'm finding ""Ascend"" more interesting.maybe my musical tastes are changing, but the only song I found fully entertaining on this CD was ""Order of Dawn"" - an interesting acoustic collaboration with Prashant Aswani...and it is exceptional (disregarding the awful MIDI keyboard bridge)I still think Greg is an amazing talent, however catchy arrangements (or anything close) from him are becoming few and far between....maybe that's on purpose (?)."
1,laguiole dubost (maybe) flatware,"I bought this set of flatware with black handles (same seller, etc.) to replace a set of VERY cheap black handled Chinese-made flatware that I have had for over 25 years. I can tell you that I can't have paid much for the Chinese stuff (like 50 cents a piece), as I was broke back then. This ""Laguiole"" flatware seems to be made to exploit the Laguiole reputation, but without any of the traditional Laguiole qualities. The flatware is light, the steel is thin, the edges are milled carelessly (if at all; they sure aren't smooth), the fittings are not snug, and all this for nearly $200. Dubost has sold out. Oh but yeah, there's a wooden box to make up for it. What a disappointment. I am, in fact, a huge fan of Laguiole cutlery, knives, etc., but I would swear this flatware was made in China. Except it isn't as good."
3,Back to the Silver Age,"Showcase Presents Superman volume 1 has many issues from the Silver Age. All you comic historians know what that means right? Silly stories that never affect the character! That's the reputation that DC's Silver Age generally has among fans. And this volume proves them wrong.In this volume we have the first appearance of Supergirl, Bizarro and Braniac, who as most people know, are lasting parts of the Superman mythos, and would also be one of the mosted adapted parts of the Superman mythos in on-screen media.One thing that I hate about this book is that you have to be extra careful with the pages or else they can get ripped/stained far easier then most other graphic novels do. So overall its a good volume, but the easiness in harming the book really brings the value down."
4,Fifties fun ... angst-free!,"It's hard to go wrong with 500-pages of early Silver Age comics for $9.99. Showcase Presents Superman features the Man of Steel in some of his earliest silver age adventures, beginning with Action Comics #241 and Superman #122. You get to see the first appearances of many Superman Family regulars in glorious black-and-white: Supergirl, Metallo, Brainiac, Lori Lemaris, Titano the Super Ape and many others.Don't expect meta-fictional angst here; these are just solid, everyday comic book adventures of the world's most iconic super-hero. This is the truth, justice and American Way Superman, not the New 52's crusading blogger feared by many. The world loves Superman in these stories. And while there is a degree of hokeyness, there's also a lot of action and fun. It's worth the money, believe me."
3,"Good stories, but falls short","I wanted to leave a message where someone from DC might see it. The superman chronicles are 5 star excellent, but these black and white Showcase books are very distracting. I, for one, would be willing to pay a higher price for color. Release Superman, and for that matter, Batman chronicles more frequently, or add color and jack the price up on the showcase books. Then, this silver age fan would be happy."
2,Warning- What they didn't tell you,"The only thing in color in this volume is the cover. The entire book is composed of a black and white newspaper-type reproduction of the comics. If you're satisfied with that, fine. Otherwise, beware. It just isn't the same as the original comics or the fine Superman in the 40's, 50's etc. series."
5,An amazing story...,"I have never been so moved by a story as I was by this one. It is, without a doubt, incredibly real, intimate, and impossible to forget. Although the book decription is accurate and intriguing, it simply can't do justice to what lies among the pages of this story. The writing is sophisticated and truly beautiful. I've heard it has developed an almost cult-like following, perhaps due to some of the behind-the-scenes controversy in its creation. (Amazon's ""new & used"" link has autographed copies available.) I highly recommend visiting the author's website to find out more. Just type her name into any search engine. I promise this is one story that will stay with you forever!"
1,Get the Original !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This book is a complete spin-off of the original PSYCHO CYBERNETICS By Maxwell Maltz, which was a classic. Don't buy this book as it's just a get-rich-quick scheme by the author Bobbe Sommer as she adds nothing substantial to the original material, just her own boring stories. I have the original book by Maxwell Maltzand it is one of the best self help book I have ever read. Bobbe Sommer has just ruined the PSYCHO CYBERNETICS philosophy by adding her own crap in this book."
1,Dont Try To Improve On Perfection!!,"Having been a fan of Dr. Maxwell Maltz's landmark book, ""Pyscho-Cybernetics"", I was anxious to see what this ""new"" one was like. I found out quickly that you can't improve on something that is so wonderful and that if you are going to write a book, at least try to do something original. Ms. Sommer's book leaves one flat and uninspired much like the text. Buy the original, it's still the best!!"
5,Psycho Cybernetics 2000,"A beautiful book dedicated to the true essence of the teachings of Dr Maxwell Maltz. Updated and applied to our modern era , the author Bobbe Sommer , applies the Psycho Cybernetics concepts to real lives and circumstances in a way that is easy to follow and apply. The fact that the author actually knew Maxwell Maltz and shares her unique first meeting with him , gives this book a special feeling and value. I really liked it !"
1,Get the right version!,"The more original a copy of Psycho-Cybernetics you can get your hands on the better! His foundation is now in the hands of other people (some competent, some sell-outs) who have used it mostly for their personal gain."
5,Exceptional Book,"I love this book! It's very simple to understand, easy and enjoyable to read. It has information that I've been looking for - a Science of Mind type approach to thinking."
5,a little better than the original,"I enjoyed the original Psych-Cybernetics when it came out. This version is moreup to date in connecting psych-cybernetics to moderndiscoveries about how the brain works. The political correctness is a little overdone, emphasizing thatthe technique can be used by women who have careers, minorities, etc., but I guess one expects that sort of thing in the ninetees. I study the book a little every day, although I have already read it once through. Excellentfor people interested in the brain."
1,Major disappointment,"I like bluegrass and Billy Currington, so I THOUGHT this CD could be a nice listen. WRONG!'Off My Rocker' is my favorite song by Currington and I've listened to it many times, yet can't even tell that this bluegrass take on it is even remotely based on the same tune. The same holds true for pretty much every other track on here.On a positive note, this recording is fine if you want to listen to just random bluegrass music and/or you can get the disc for free, otherwise this is just a waste of time and money."
1,Don't bother,Billy Currington is far too talented to have his name on this album. Pick something else.
2,Not advertised clearly,"Recieved this item and found out that it is not the songs by Billy Currington, it is a tribute album by other artists with no words to any of the music. If you are looking for these songs as heard on the radio, this is not what you want."
4,Good Book,This is a good book with lots of information on uranium content in antique glass. Great pictures! I only wish there was more information on the patterns of the glassware.
4,Mouse & The Traps - 'Fraternity Years' (Big Beat) 4 1/2 stars,"Until now, I have vaguely even heard of this psychedelic / garage band from Tyler, Texas. Apparently, the band put out plenty of good singles between 1965-69. But, no albums. No problem, this twenty-five track compilation says it all. Tunes I found myself playing over many times are ""Public Execution"" (sounds SO much like Bob Dylan, it's almost scary), ""Maid Of Sugar,Maid of Spice"", ""I've Got Her Love"", ""I Am The One"", the Monkees-like ""Promises,Promises"" and ""I Satisfy"". Line-up: Ronnie 'Mouse' Weiss-vocals, Doug Rhone-guitar&vocals, David Stanley-bass, Randy Fouts-keyboards and Don Garrett-drums. Should appeal to most fans of the Standells, Chocolate Watchband, Gentrys, Kingsmen and the Outcasts. Essential."
5,great product!,"filter went in just as it was supposed to do, works great. I noticed a nicer sound and a little bit more torque off the line."
4,"Hey, I even liked the vocal!","It seems that those who didn't wholly like this CD were especially against ""Together Again"" with its vocal, while I thought this was a sharp ""wake up"" number to be placed near the midpoint.Be that as it may, there are several sounds here, tribal at times, smoky cocktail lounge-like at times, heart-tugging, and yet rhythms that make your feet want to dance. The sax itself sings at time and dances at times.I would say that Steve Cole needs to go a bit further before he'll be accepted as a top man in the smooth jazz genre, but the spark is there. Songs such as Together Again, Between Us, and Waterfall exhibit a talent to be reckoned with."
1,What A Waste of the worlds time,"If amazon did a 0 then this would score that, what a waste of my time, halfway through I took my dog for a walk, it was that bad, what a blooming waste of my time.Now I have to admit, the babes were quite good, and the main actor did what he could with a script they got off a cereal box packet, but overall it rated a 0, and I am being kind giving it a one star."
5,Funniest Movie Ever,Literally the best worst movie ever. If you have a dry sense of humor do not hesitate to rent or even buy this masterpiece.
3,Demonicus is so cool!!!,"It begins with a guy and girl walking down a Italy road and the guy spots a cave that really looks like a tunnel.This is your same old don`t go in there scene but the guy had to have a look anyway. What he finds is a almost perfect dead body of the legendary gladiator Tyranus. He puts on his helmet and become posed by the evil gladiator. So thru out the movie we see the guy killing every camper,hiker,and everybody else in sight and Demonicus is got such cool music that sounds like it`s from a video game and yes this movie has some errors in it but they are funny!.Horror fans will be thrilled to see a crazy gladiator movie this."
1,KENZO RULES!,"Well, what do you want? It's a cheezy horror film and a barrel of laughs. Gregory Lee Kenyon did a great job with a [bad] story. Not an easy part to play. It's good for a few chuckles!!! Maybe in the sequel they will get the audio track right. Halfway thru my DVD, the audio was not in sync, making it like watching an old Godzilla movie!! Nice looking babes in the film as well, didn't hurt!"
1,not as describe,i chose color red according to my type of stick as what the description said. but i received black. not as good as wood when use for rim shot.
2,ugh,"How dare Comus follow up the brilliantly insane First Utterance with this very mediocre second utterance? I don't know what the hell they were thinking, but all the life was drained from the vivacious rhythms and lyrics of the first album. This sounds like normal stale classic rock nonsense from the 1970s.In honesty I would be far easier on this album if it were not made by Comus. In fact, I am pretty sure that it is incorrect to even call the musicians on this album Comus, because they sound completely different and have none of the violent character of the first album.I mean I was listening to the first song or so and I thought that it was just a weak first track, but then it kept on going in much the same vein. I think that the band quit doing acid or something after recording First Utterance because this is stale and tired rubbish in my book."
4,This was a big hit,My son got this for his 5th birthday.he loves it.The only thing is switching it back and forth is not easy and he is not really old enought for the skate board yet and he wants to ride it that was not very safe for a 5 year old to ride it without the handle.
2,Juvenile,"The only other work of Jakes that I have read was Charleston. Savannah is a completely different type of book. The main character is a young girl, which makes the book feel like it is geared toward the teenage crowd. Descriptions are not very detailed and all of the action that takes place is void of any feeling of excitement. I was expecting something similar to Charleston with its complex families and detailed descriptions of places and events. My main purpose for reading this book was the hope that I would learn a little more about a city I enjoy visiting. Obviously, I was unable to get a better view of the city of Savannah and I got little worth out of the book in general."
2,contrived and un-enjoyable read,"This is the first John Jakes book I have read entirely and after hearing about his much acclaimed writing - I must state that I am sorely disappointed. His writing (at least in this his most recent work) is flabby and full of useless and cumbersome clichés. He takes so much liberty with historical fact that it renders the book un-enjoyable. But that did not seem to deter professional critics and book reviewers. They laud ""Savannah."" But why? Perhaps at this point in his life, Mr. Jakes is riding his own coattails. Too bad, I am an avid reader of history and author of a book on a Civil War regiment from Georgia and the author of a book on Savannah history - Mr. Jakes did both topics as well as the craft of fiction a disservice in this recent work."
1,My favorite author writes a dud....,"What is going on here, I read this because John Jakes is one of the best authors I have ever read.....Virtually everything else has been great, I could not get into this......Oh, well, he is still great...."
2,For Young Adults???,"What a disappointment. Savannah reads as if it were written for ages 12-14. Charleston was superbly done. Savannah doesn't have the depth, the character development of Jakes' other works. It's almost childish....as a history scholar, I can assure you that Cump Sherman had no heartwarming ""cute"" encounters with children. He was a cold hard man, a professional soldier, doing a bitter job. He spared little in the way of warmth to anyone."
4,Not as bad as some say.,Sure its not perfect but this book is a heck of a lot better then what passes for historical fiction nowadays. While the characters and the resolutions are a little convenient there is still a satisfying conclusion and I can't understand what everyone is complaining about
2,Poor Effort,"Very disapointed. For an author I would follow (buy) anywhere, this book seems like a kids version of what could have been a much more developed and detailed novel along the lines of Jakes other masterpieces. Even paying a discounted ~$15.00, I feel I was ripped off. Hope it is not a portent of things to come."
3,"just didn't ""make the cut""","I've read each and every word ever written by Mr. Jakes.Been a long time fan.And yes I do agree with most everyone else here, this book was just a little less that I expected of him.But, I'll admit I compared it to his earlier masterpieces.the North & South TrilogyCharlestonOn Secret ServiceWhich, when you think about it, isn't really fair.so, in conclusion, I did enjoy the book. It was an easy, quick read, had a few unexpected twists, but in no way can compare to the earlier books."
4,Love 'em,Very tasty and filling. We have them on regular automatic delivery. I just wish they were officially kosher -- can't share them with many friends and I feel a little embarrassed to eat them in front of people who can't eat them -- or I'd be eating (and sharing) more!
4,Best Nutrition Bar,"Been buying this brand and particular flavor for over 18 months now and still like it. It's very tasty and more lemon-y than cranberry-y! Slightly tart with whole fruits, nuts, and seeds in it.Unfortunately, it's one of few nutrition bars that does not have chocolate in it. I like chocolate but cannot tolerate too much of it. Wish there were more flavors without chocolate to choose from.Also wish nutrition bar makers would make flavors that mimic meals, like chili or pasta dishes. Don't need sweets all the time!"
4,Music From Behind The Castle,"The Knebworth Festival has been a part of England's musicial history since the mid-1970's. These two CD's spotlight the artists from the 1990 Festival.Elton John, Paul McCartney, Pink Floyd, Dire Straits, Genesis, Robert Plant, Eric Clapton, The Shadows and more, this is quite a line-up of great artists. The performances rule the Kingdom here: ""Comfortably Numb"", ""Sunshine Of Your Love"", ""Hey Jude"", ""Turn It On Again"", ""Everybody Wants To Rule The World"", ""Sad Songs"" & ""Rockin' All Over The World"".These are two full CD's of the UK's best and in front of a crowd of Zillions. These performances are much akin to the Live Aid performances from Wembley in 1985, the Performers are different, but it is the same spirit as Live Aid.This CD set is still available, and they go cheap {Mine was under $10.00.}This is worth seeking out.Four Stars !!!"
4,I thought this was a cute series,This was a fun and playful series i thought. I think its the same concept of show like American Pickers. But if you like American Pickers then you would probably like this show.
3,Its just OK.,I had never seen this show before. So I assumed it was similar to American Pickers. Its NOT! The end result is often cool. Like what they do with they stuff the buy out on the road. But the journey to buy the stuff is full of two woman who sound like high school girls trying to flirt with old men to get a good deal. Half of what they buy they don't even know what it is. It was just OK. I only watched three episodes.
2,Quality is inconsistent,"I have brought these few times, the first bottle that we have received seems to mix well, also the taste was good , but the next 2 bottles were not as good as the first one. It seems to be a hit or miss if you buy this product it might come out good or bad. These powder seems to come in two different packaging one is purple and other is green, I tried both and they seems to taste bad. BTW also tried perfect acai which is costlier but the taste is much better then this one and also it state the ORAC ingredients etc upfront"
4,Good Stuff,"I have enjoyed the supplement very much. It has increased my energy level and is easy to use. It is a bit strong taken on it's own with water, but added to a daily protein mix drink, it is fine."
2,unmixable,This stuff will mix with hardly anything. It floats to the top of whatever liquid you try to mix it with. Looks a little like gun powder and has a gritty (although not unpleasant) taste. I think I will switch back to grape juice and take my chances.
3,it's ok,"I got the acai for health reasons and I'm sure it's doing what it's supposed to do. It disolves much harder than I thought it would, if it disolves at all. Like others, putting it in a smoothie distributes it through the drink better. It's good in the Kefir products. Had no taste that I could discern."
4,great so far,"Sambazon appears to be a quality company and amazon makes it a little more affordable. I like the taste of the powder. It takes a little like baked cherry pie to me and I mix it with a yogurt smoothie or a dark berry juice. The rich color attests to the antioxitant and vitamin factor and I do feel a little more energetic when I take it. You can feel the fiber texture a little and I taste the omega properties some, but it's one of the tastier ways of getting your omega's in your diet- (versus fish oil). Overall, I bought two bottles and plan to finish both."
3,"Sambazon Acai Powder-get real. Bland taste, lots of hype and $$$$$","Common people!,I have read other people's reviews and was laughing hysterically.Do you really believe this product is going to save you from autoimmune or other disorders?And according to one review it is full of antioxidants??? ARE YOU SERIOUS?How do you know? Or you are from the company who is selling this really chalky powder on recent ACAI HYPE??Everybody, please just stick to taste, flavor, price etc in your reviews. Do not give poor people ideas some product that has absolutely no proven evidence on any facts it is good for you is going to help with disease or any health problems!Do not waste you monies, this product will do nothing for you health wise!Taste is OK, nothing very special.

5,Very good book.,"When my husband passed away several years ago, I found this book at Walmart. It helped me maintain my sanity. It is well written and helped me stay connected to God. The scriptures and vows are right on target no matter the situation.I have given this book to many people over the years because it helped me so much when I was grieving. I bought it once again for someone who lost a loved one. I still keep my copy close by to use for whatever reason. It covers almost every imaginable situation.You won't go wrong with this purchase."
3,good times!,all the songs on this record remind me of all the fun times growing up....it's like being 13 all over again....cathy is as still sexy as she was back then...i can never get enough of a readhead!
4,Excellent Euro-dance album,"Yes, Cathy Dennis is better known today for having written ""Can't Get You Out Of My Head"" for Kylie Minogue than for her own singing efforts, but in early 1990 she ruled the charts with four singles (two in the top 10!) from the monster album ""Move To This"".If it's been awhile since you've heard ""Touch Me (All Night Long)"", ""Everybody Move"" (which had a great video), or ""Too Many Walls"" (one of the best ballads of all time), you will be shocked by how well these songs have aged. The CD also includes ""Come And Get My Love"", a dance favorite from 1989.Cathy may be more of a songwriter today (due to the catastrophic failure of her next two albums), but ""Move To This"" proves she could hold her own with the best pop divas of the early 90s. Definitely worth the price to pick up."
4,All the moves still fresh,"Cathy Dennis's debut album does not leave one grasping for superlatives, but it is a solid and promising effort throughout. The then 21-year-old sings each song on the album, has co-written every song except one and has co-produced six of the 10 tracks.'Move To This', a dance album, contains the first single, 'Just Another Dream' and at least two other tracks worthy of radio attention in 'Got To Get Your Love' and 'Everybody Move'. The remaining fare should not let anyone down. 'Tell Me' and 'Too Many Walls' are two more of the better tracks in a good bunch which should keep dance floors occupied from start to finish. D Mob's hit 'C'Mon And Get My Love' also makes an appearance.The Englishwoman's voice verges on the sweet and is occasionally reminiscent of a young Olivia Newton John, particularly on 'Everybody Move'."
1,1.5 Stars,"Another disappointment. The only good thing on the CD is ""Too Many Walls""... besides that, the CD is pretty much not good for much."
4,"I'm still ""moving to this"" now!","I love the cd. Miss Dennis likes to make people move with songs like ""Move to this"", ""c'mon & get my love"", ""All night long(touch me)"" and ""Just another dream"". These songs have remained my favorite 4.When I bought it, I was crazy to pay[the price]for 10 songs, but I really wanted the disc. Only 2 days ago, did I record her music onto a mini-disc. It brings back good memories to hear her dance club hits. I'll never tire of her energy packed music and her cute British accent. ""Move to this"" is better than her follow up cd, ""Into the skyline"". Cathy Dennis won my heart then and she still wins it now.The reason why I rated the cd only 4 stars, is because I was disappointed in the sound-alike quality of the first 3 tracks. Cathy should have changed the tone of the background music, to differ the songs altogether. But then again, artists usually take a sound and stay with it for an album or two.I'll say it again. I love the cd. I think you'll appreciate it too."
2,just real nutty,"This one was really weird. I didnt get it. but for some it may work, just not my style."
4,nice product but...,"This is a good product but I would like to point out that the product description above (as of 2/1/2010) ""indoor/outdoor fun"" is in direct contradiction to the ""for indoor use only"" written in large letters across the product packing when it arrived; hopefully the product description will soon be fixed to match, but until then I wanted anyone who that mattered to, to know."
3,a nice tool to have on the bookcase,"Although Rosamond Richardson probably lives ALONE in a location where the things she recommends using are available nearby, it's not a worthless book. I disagree with her worldview completely, but there are still some good recipes and interesting ideas inside the book. If you have a large family, live in a very rural place, or have a restricted budget, many of the ideas are impractical. I first checked this out of the library, but enjoyed the ideas enough to buy my own copy. I suspect Ms. Richardson is retired, has plenty of free time, and has an ample budget for organic products. If any of that describes you, you may well really appreciate this book."
4,Great Music,"Yulya really brings home russian music. I particularily like the ""Little Blue Kerchief""...Welcome to the motherland...!"
2,"Good collection of songs, disappointing performance","I have read all previous reviews (that's why I bought this CD), and I'd like to add my opinion too.This CD is a very good collection of folk and soviet favourites. Those who would like to refresh lyrics will find it very useful. But the performance/voice for me personally were rather disappointing. Those who expect anything like Shulzhenko ili Zykina style can skip this disk. The performance is on the level of a friend singing in a small company in the second part of the evening. For a singing friend the voice is beautiful and interpretation is very interesting. But for a wider audience ... I couldn't help thinking that this is not an appropriate level."
4,Farm Animal Card Review,I like this toy and the cards that you can exchange. My son is outgrowing it though...
3,Go buy Mother Earth!,"This is a good album & worth buying, but after making an album as fantastic as their last one(Mother Earth),this comes as somewhat of a letdown! Im not a fan of Evanescence & feel they are mediocre at best and unfortunatley this album sort of sounds a little too much like Evanescence for my taste, as a matter of fact there are times when I couldnt tell I was listening to Within Temptation(even the lead singers voice sounds a little different on this album). The stand out track is ""Memories"".I truly hope this album isnt the direction the band wants to go & on their next release they can get back to buisiness. Before you make up your mind about this band rush out and buy Mother Earth, Hell buy 2 copies."
4,"Aside from Stand my ground, a formidable attempt by WT","I've been a fan of WT for quite a while, and when I saw the video for stand my ground i was upset, because it sounded like they had sold out! But, I gave them a second try, and i'm glad I did. The rest of the album sounds like the band I know and love. So if you're willing to bypass Stand My Ground, then go for it. But if you're a new fan that wants to get into WT, then I'd highly recommend Mother Earth instead."
5,Unbelievable album,"An unbelievable album. It is awesome from beginning to end. There is not one weak song. Great vocals, musicianship, and orchestration. A masterpiece of progressive metal."
3,Not their best,"Between some of the songs I have heard before, some of the other ones are screechy and obnoxious. I know they can do better..."
5,amazing,"This is my favorite cd out of all the ones I own. Words cannot even express how much I adore this album. I never heard about Within Temptation until this album came out. The Silent Force definitely made me love WT because they are simply amazing. All the songs on this cd are perfect, I love all of them. Sharon has such a beautiful and pure voice. The music is great and so is the choir. I suggest this cd to anyone who loves great singing and music! You won't be disappointed because it's worth every penny. 5/5 for sure!"
4,Done Well,"This voice makes me think of a well trained Oliva Newton-John. Soft, reaching, melodic this is voice that is immursed in the music - part of the whole. I don't know if I'd go to the goth demension, it's not really dark music and it's really not metal, it's a niche sound that fits as well done break from other styles and it's really, really good at it.This and the other reviews make me want to check out other cd's even though I'm into driving r-n-r and metal I enjoy Nightwish, In This Moment and now Within Temptation.Well done. Paul"
5,A Deal at Twice the Price,"This CD was worth every penny: soulful, operatic, and yet still grounded in fire-and-fury, balls-out rock. ""Stand My Ground"" is a beautiful testimony to strenth and individuality, ""Aquarius"" gains points for the mythology reference, and ""Angels"" simply stunning. If you need a reason to by the CD, listen to ""Angels."""
2,boring,"After their great success with ""Mother Earth,"" it seems that Within Temptation is struggling to find a niche in the music world. I loved ""Mother Earth"" and its fusion of musical genres. I eagerly anticipated the group's next CD. I was disappointed in this newest release. There are no songs that leave any lasting impression to speak of, and the songs tend to sound boring and repetitive after the first 3 cuts. For those of you who loved ""Mother Earth,"" don't bother buying ""Silent Force."""
5,Gothic Rock!,I found Within Temptation while listening to Pandora and now own every one of theirs albums. Their music is refreshing and unique!
3,More Aor Then Hair,"This is more in the Aor mode than hair metal,it's got alot of keys,remindsme of house of lords which is a good thing.Though it's got some greatguitars here and there.If your into Za-Za,Fierce heart,valentine and suchit's for you.I favor the hard edge stuff!!"
4,THE GREATEST FU@#ING REVIEW IN THE HISTORY OF MAN,"I CANNOT ATTEMPT TO REVIEW THIS AVERAGE DEATH METAL COMPILATION AFTER THE PREVIOUS REVIEW. IT IS JUST SOOOO DAMN GOOD--POSSIBLY, AND I SAY THIS WITH NO QUIVER IN MY VOICE, ""THE GREATEST REVIEW EVER WRITTEN."" BEHOLD THE BEHEMOTH, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN...ZACH DAVIDSON..."
3,not exactly for the beginner...,"This chunky book is so cute, but, not exactly for the beginner knitter.Having helped my daughter with her very first sweater project [we each knitted the Back-Buttoned Top]. Had she been on her own, I do not think she would have ended up with a sweater. As an experienced knitter, I can follow where the pattern might be going. I wish that more space would be used for type, making the instructions easier to read. I'd like to see the text delineated better. The finishing instructions leave something to be desired.She substituted Reynolds Allagash for the yarn Karabella Softig in her sweater. I used 2 stands of Reynolds Eternity."
2,Small and under powered,I was expecting a full size spot light. This item is small and really not that bright. I will have to find another light to meet my needs. Nice light to have around the house though.
2,Let there be light - 1.5 million dim candles!,"I guess you get what you pay for. Item was on sale at a decent price so I thought, what the heck, give it a shot. The first one I received would not work and the glass lense rattled. Amazon sent a replacement (5 stars for Amazon). The second one works as advertised - EXCEPT - my old, well used 1 million candle power light is significantly brighter than this Cheap Hokey Indisputably Not American product - and - the glass lense rattles."
4,Well informed discussing the pros and cons of annuities,"This was a very well written book covering everything a novice would want to know about investing in annuities. However, I would have liked to see a direct comparison of an employer sponsored 401k to a variable annuity. Overall, I would not invest in an annuity due to the complex rules and regulations coupled with their ongoing high fees. I would rather put my money into a Roth IRA, Traditional IRA and/or 401K."
2,outdated material,"Good definitions. Combines discussion of Variable with Fixed Indexed Annuities, when they would be better confined to separate chapters."
3,getting started in annuities,I was looking more for a annuity selling system. Please refer books in this area. Thank you.Frank X. Netter
1,"Awful, Awful, Awful!!!","First of all, this game isn't by Activision, it's put out by Gamemill Publishing and a design company called Stellar Stone, who exclusively use Russian designers/programers ('cause they're cheaper). I guess that would explain why the Union and Confederate uniforms are backwards. Yes, you read correctly, backwards! If the Russkies couldn't figure out who wore blue and who wore gray, you can pretty well figure they didn't get much else right either. So much for the historical accuracy the game claims. This game is a total rip-off."
1,Leaves much to be desired,"This game was obviously programmed by people who had little to no historical knowledge of the Civil War. The only battle out of the four with even a semblance of the historical military balance is Gettysburg. The other three, the ""Seven Days Battle,"" Chattanooga, and Chancellorsville, bear no resemblance to the actual battles in either landscape or units involved. And as other reviewers have pointed out, the ""Confederation"" wears blue uniforms and the Union grey. In addition, artillery units are so deadly in this game that no other unit can get near them. They can virtually win a battle by themselves, which was certainly not the case in the Civil War.The game also crashes quite a bit."
1,What a joke this is!,"What a waste of money! Who ever desgned this game knows very little about the civil war. The battle fields are hopelessly exagerated, it looks like the the civil war was fought in the swiss alps according to this game. I've been to the real battlefields and they bare no resemblance to anything in this game! The union side is in gray uniforms (HuH?, The confederates are in blue (Say what?) Artillery is useless and doesn't move! The computer pretty much decides when a unit will attack so you have no control past a certain point, makes it a little hard to spring an ambush. Grant wasn't even in charge of the Union forces in 3 of these battles so why the name Lee vs. Grant? Overall a very poor game in design and historical accuracy, don't waste you money!"
1,ONE IS BORN EVERY MINUTE,Loaded just fine.... But that was all... Every time I tried to use it - it crashed my computer witha fatal error... A real waste.... DO NOT BUY...
2,Plot is kind of old...,"This book used a rather hackneyed plot: Girl(usually WASP) from wealthy parents falls in love with guy from a poorer family or minority family, girl's parents are snobs and dissaprove of girl's boyfriend and think he's not good enough for their fragile, precious daughter. Another hackneyed addition to this plot: wrong- side-of-the-tracks boyfriend ""proves"" his worthiness to girl's snobby parents by rescuing the girl. So was the plot with Sandy and Manuel. I might have switched it around so the boy was the one stuck with snobby, wealthy parents. Add variety to overused plots. That's what Ann Martin did in her BSC series. In the BSC, with Logan and Mary Anne, Logan's parents are the wealthier ones and his father looks down his nose at Mary Anne, who comes from a poorer family. AND, Mary Anne doesn't wait around for Logan to rescue her. If I'd been in Sandy's shoes, I'd have brought Manuel to meet her parent early and let her parents see for themselves what he was like!"
2,Buyer beware!,"Pay careful attention to the page count. This version DOES NOT contain all of the stories of the hardcover original. In fact, it contains only ONE of Randolph Mason's ""strange schemes"".If that were all- I would not down-rate the book. However- at the price- I would expect the one story to be free of omissions and completely missing lines.It is not.I cannot recommend this Kindle edition. If you are a fan of Melville Davisson Post, please do yourself a favor and wait for a better, more complete version of this eBook."
5,Precious!,My daughter loves this wonderful counting book! She almost sings through the pages. The illustrations are lovely and the story is fun.
3,Questionable remastering,"I love the stuff on this album...but this is not exactly what I used to have on vinyl. Somewhere, the remastering went awry.I still have an old vinyl copy of Pretty Ballerina. After listening to the CD and thinking ""something's missing here,"" I plopped the old vinyl record on my turntable, and sure enough, there was the droning organ that got lost waaaayyy back in the mix on the CD. And the whole song sounds a lot more FULL on the vinyl copy.Some CD reissues are great -- revealing things in the songs that were difficult to hear before. This one actually manages to OBSCURE some sounds that were there before. Ack!"
4,Baroque Rock at its Peak,"The first 11 tracks of this CD represent the original ""Left Banke"" album and feature wonderful vocals backed with fine arrangements. While the 'A side' material (the hits) were great, the 'B side' stuff kept to the same high level of perfection.Even now, years later, ""Lazy Day"" still runs through my head.The band changes tone and seems to mellow out in the later stages; while still goo, they lack the intensity of the early recordings.A great treat for the ears."
2,Dancing the Test of Time...,"39 years later, the hauntingly bittersweet orchestration of ""Pretty Ballerina"" still sends shivers through me taking me to the place inside myself that was first engaged by this music so many years ago; ""Walk Away Renee"" is on par with the caliber of ""Pretty Ballerina"" which is why it has ended up on Rolling Stone's Top 500 List.Oddly, the remaining tracks do not live up to the 'cutting edge' of the mid-'60's; they remain relatively obscure, blending in with so much of the light rock and roll of the early '60's.This album remains one that bridged the gap between the late '50's/early '60's pop scene and the late '60's psychedelic/acid rock explosion; an album well worth owning with ""Walk Away Renee"" and ""Pretty Ballerina"" being its cornerstones...dancing the test of time."
5,Left Banke - 'There's Gonna Be A Storm: The Complete Recordings 1966-69'' (Mercury),"Review no. 55. More or less, I had totally forgotten about this highly talented AM psychedelic late '60's band. A must-have twenty-six track compilation / collection of (presumably) everything the Left Banke had ever recorded. Best described as baroque pop. Many of these songs show true beauty that is so rarely found in music - especially in this day and age. Tunes like their two most familiar cuts ""Walk Away Renee"" and ""Pretty Ballerina"" as well as the stunning ""Barterers And Their Wives"", the toe-tapping ""What Do You Know?"", the well-played ""Dark Is The Bark"", ""In The Morning Light"" and the sort of familiar-sounding ""Pedestal"". Recommended for fans of the Zombies, The Nazz, Hollies, Sundowners and Buckinghams."
5,Awesome,"I am a 60's music collector and was estatic when I found this on Amazon. When I tried to purchase the CD at music stores, I was told that they did not carry it or can not order me the product. I decided to try Amazon. I was thriled when I was able to locate this particular CD and purchase it. The product was in excellent condition and I was 100% satisified. Thanks"
3,WHAT!!!! / NOT ME,"THIS IS A PRETTY GOOD COLLECTION, LUCKILY I'VE GOT A COPY OF IT. I NOTICED IT IS NOW OUT OF PRINT AND THE PRICES THAT THESE PEOPLE ARE ASKING FOR IS JUST.. WHAT'S THE WORD... PLUM LOCO, I DON'T CARE WHAT CD IT WAS OR WHO THE ARTIST IS, THERE IS NO WAY, I'M GONNA SPEND $100.00 - $124.00 ON A CD, I DON'T CARE IF THE THING IS OUT OF PRINT. THESE PEOPLE MUST THINK THAT THE CD IS MADE OF GOLD OR SOMETHING. WHO IN THEIR RIGHT MIND IS GONNA SPEND THAT KIND OF MONEY. NOT ME."
2,Storm? How about a drizzle,"I searched for the single `Walk Away Renee"" for 25-years. Finally, There's Gonna Be A Storm ended my long quest. `Walk Away Renee' is the most majestic example of 60's Renaissance Pop. Beautiful, melodic and unforgettable. Unfortunately, the remainder There's Gonna Be A Storm doesn't hold a candle to 'Walk Away.' The other 15 songs are pathetic attempts to merge Mersey Beat Pop with Classical music. The tinny harpsichord lines, pseudo-string arrangements and whispering vocals are about as exciting as warm milk. Now I understand why the Left Banke was a one hit wonder: there is only one tolerable song in their entire catalog. Storm? How about a drizzle. This CD hurts my ears (not to mention my pocketbook)."
1,Martha,"I was disappointed in this version of the Slinky. It is almost like raw metal and very stiff. I had intended to give it to a child, but decided it was not appropriate for a gift."
3,In Bruges,"Dark humor which isn't my 'cup of tea', but well acted and written. Lots of violence, but necessitated by the subject. Scenes of Bruges, Belgium are great--makes me want to visit. I've given away my copy as it isn't a movie I would watch more than once."
5,Watch it,"The background scenery is enchanting. The characters are involved in low life activities, yet they are somewhat charming with their guilt and one may actually start feeling for them regardless of what they do. It's murder for hire with people that have some values."
2,It could have been great,"First half of the movie was great...the second half completely ruined the movie with a terrible pointless ending.After the ending, I was actually hoping I could find a way to get my time back. What a waste of time."
2,Hilarious?,"A would-be hit man accidentally murders a child on his first job. Hilarity ensues! Well, not unless the parenthetical-explanation-as-a-running-joke ""It's in Belgium"" strikes you funny. And there might also be something funny in there about alcoves. Had I not remembered the advertising for the film when it was in theaters, and had the case not described it as a comedy, I might have actually enjoyed it as a standard gangster film which is really what it is.On a bright note, Brendan Gleeson gives a really stand-out performance and I'm going to make a point of looking for other movies he's been in."
3,Sex on run,"Hit-men had found refuge in Bruges, Belgium, just being involved in a new string of crimes, sex and murders.As to reviewer, a bit long, boring and not so generally entertaining."
4,Morality tale,"This morality tale is kept afloat by Colin Farrell's performance. The story of two hit men temporarily staying in Bruges after a botched job in which a child was inadvertently killed is really dark and sad, but Farrell brings a charm and comic touch to his character that keeps the film from being too depressing. His character maintains a strange innocence so that even when doing terrible things, the audience can continue to find him sympathetic. Playing the perfect yang to Farrell's yin is Ralph Fiennes, who plays the hitmen's unrepentant, psychotic boss.Ultimately, the film asks whether it's possible to escape the consequences and find redemption after doing something horrible. The answers appear to be no and maybe."
3,Thoughtful Gangster Yarn,"PLOTAfter an assignment goes terribly wrong, a young hitman is taken by his mentor to Bruges, Belgium. While they hide there awaiting further instructions, they find time to bond, and experience the local culture.REVIEWAlthough violent in parts, this is an offbeat, humorous and touching film about male camaraderie. There's a certain inescapable philosophy that holds the viewer's interest. The dialogue is especially well crafted, and the chemistry between the three leads, Brendan Gleeson, Colin Farrell and Ralph Fiennes, is palpable. The various twists are a little contrived, but do not detract too much from the overall quality of the film.`In Bruges' is one of the better films of 2008. It's a film that stays with you. It would make a good purchase on DVD, even for those who've already caught it at the cinema.SPECIAL MENTIONSBrendan Gleeson for Acting."
4,Funny if you have that sense of humor,"I got recommended this by a friend - it passed me by.The story is straightfoward enough and the movie is mostly about the interaction of Farrell & Gleeson's characters....with a few stings in the tale.I must say I was very impressed by Farrell. Having only ever seen him in his Hollywood blockbuster stuff I had dismissed him, but he played this dark yet funny character. Ralph Fiennes was also brilliantly ""manically funny"". Heck Gleeson's good too - it's just that Farrell is a stand out.It is a quirky type of humor - dark, sarcastic, lots of swearwords. There's only maybe a couple of real ""laugh out loud"" parts (the restaurant scene being my favorite!) but don't misconstrue that - there's plenty going on to keep you smiling. If that's your kind of thing - and as a Brit it is for me - I would thoroughly recommend this. And don't worry - you should be fine watching it without subtitles on!A bit of a sleeper this one, but a gem."
4,"A Perfectly Efficient, Versatile Little Slice of the Wild Life","Billed as a black comedy, this story of two stir-crazy Irish hitmen on the lam in Belgium could just as easily fall into any one of a dozen other genres. With traces of humor, suspense, romance, action and drama all stirred into the same bubbling pot, the risk is certainly there for overexertion, but the finished product doesn't fall short in any instance. The comedy is sharply witty and well-timed, the action fast-paced and fiery, the romance heartfelt but not heavy. Colin Farrell, whose eyebrows migrate around his forehead like a pair of pitch black caterpillars on acid, works a good range of emotions out of his fairly simple leading role and cleanly manages to get us rooting for him by the time the closing scenes roll around. Upon reflection, there really isn't all that much to the story - it's predictable at worst, minimal at best - but there doesn't need to be."
5,In Bruges,"This film is perfectly cast, Cinematography is amazing, story line keeps you interested, and great comic relief from what could be a very dark film. Many interesting characters. And subplots... almost a perfect film."
3,A different kind of hitman story,I didn't know what to expect before I viewed this film. For some reason I thought it was going to be funny but it was not. It was actually sad and sort of ridiculous. But the acting was great and kept me watching even if the story was a bit slack.
4,Pretty good movie even though it is in F'n Bruges.,"This was a pretty good, funny, black comedy. Good acting all the way around which is suprising since one of the actors is Colin Farrell who usually plays everything exactly the same way and makes some pretty crappy movies. I liked it."
4,In Bruges Review,"I gave this movie a solid 4 stars, it would have been 5 but sometimes you have difficulty understanding what the actors are saying. It's just the dialect but still mildly irritating at certain points. This is a thinking persons movie with sprinkles of action that is well done. It is a movie that begs repeat viewings and gets better with each one. It is wonderfully cast with strong performances by the principal actors, all in all a good solid and enjoyable movie."
3,Its entertaining...,"and its hilarious at bits but unfortunately the ending is predictable and ralph fiennes (an excellent actor see 'the quiz show') seems like he is just impersonating ben kingsly's charachter from sexy beast. theres no deeper meaning here that would warrant repeated viewings, definately a rent!"
4,Flawless,"A flawless piece of cinema, guaranteed to move you. This is storytelling at its best. I would also recommend the books The Cyclops Hammer by Dale Myers and Memoirs of an Italian Terrorist if you're interested in mystery. Both are excellent books."
3,Only a bit of comedy; lots of drama and ugliness,Not a fun movie. The comedy is lost often in the heavy accents. Too much shooting and blood. How is this primarily billed as a comedy???
4,Fairy Tale in Bruges,"I rented ""In Bruges"" because I was brought up in Belgium and Bruges is my favorite place. Bruges is aptly named ""the Venice of the North"" due to its meandering canals and lovely medieval architecture. I also like British gangster movies a la ""Sexy Beast.""""In Bruges"" is a dark comedy with witty dialogue most of the time, leadened with un p.c. humor, and bloody guts.R. Fiennes pays hommage to Ben Kingsley (Sexy Beast) by imitating him in the early scene. He is mesmerizing in his role. You have seen other reviews so you know the plot.Fiennes is superb; Brendon Gleeson is great; and Colin Farrell is good.I watched the movie last night thinking that it was fine overall but somehow lacking. Today I watched a second time and loved it."
5,Dark Comedy,"I loved it, its like a heavy metal song that starts off classical and lulls you into happiness and then changes abruptly into rage rock. I felt compelled to keep watching when I wanted to stop. It is dark. I laughed a lot. I want to watch it again, but I have to gain my courage. The cinemotography was beautiful."
5,Part travelogue/dark comedy/hriller/buddy movie,"In Bruges is certainly a different type of movie: part travelogue, part dark (very dark) comedy, part thriller, part character study, part buddy movie, but it all works in a peculiar way! The direction, cinematography and acting are all top notch and the next time I visit Europe, I certainly plan on visiting Bruges."
5,Excellent movie,"I won't go into a lot of detail about the plot, other reviewers have done that very well. I wasn't sure what to expect when I went to see this in the theatre. I found myself laughing at situations that normally are not considered funny. I missed some of the dialog as the accents are hard to follow, I might have to see it again. I highly recommend this movie, but I don't think it is for children."
4,Very good,"Those expecting typical hollywood action/comedy should look elsewhere. This is a highly entertaining film with some funny moments, but not a feel good movie."
5,Great Independent Film!,"After personally spending a weekend in Bruges, it was suggested that I see the movie ""In Bruges"". Curious and wanting to see the extraordinary views again, I purchased the film. I was not only pleased with the great views of Bruges...it was a really GOOD movie. You will get caught up in the characters search for moral grounds, albeit while working as professional hitmen! (has strong language and violence)"
4,Hilarious,"I've only previously seen Colin Farrell in the woeful ""Alexander"". After this, all is forgiven. He is marvellous as the hit-man who bungles his first job. Brendan Gleeson is equally good as his more experienced accomplice and Ralph Fiennes makes up a perfect threesome as the thuggish boss beset by his own odd code of honour. In spite of one glaring impossibility, I haven't enjoyed a film so much in ages. Just don't bring your maiden aunt, unless her hearing aid has a swear-word filter."
3,Interesting Film - NOT A COMEDY,"Don't pay attention to any of the ""canned"" blurbs about this movie. It is about as far from a comedy as you can get. Its a very dark film with some comedic moments and a warped sense of irony. In the end, it tells an old story... bad people, no matter how charming or repentant, still are bad people."
5,Excellent Film...,"I was hugely surprised by this movie..I did not expect it do be as good as it was..I believe I was thrown off by the horrible cover they put on the front of the movie and the lines on it shoot first sight see later..HORRIBLE..They did not capture this movie in any of that. This was a wonderful movie with quite a roller coaster of emotions in it..It has a lot of humor in it but I would not consider it a comedy..It has alot more elements then that..Acting was very good and I loved the music they picked for it..It gave it a awesome feel to the film..To sum it up, this was a great movie and definitly do not judge a book by its cover.."
2,Too cute,"An acting exercise with some humor and interesting characters. But ultimately the story's weaknesses, especially at the end, kill the enjoyment. A poke at Fellini-like reality? A let down, when we hoped for more."
3,What hit-men do on vacation?,"See the sights, pick up girls, get in fights and kill each the other?Sort of a sad slow waltz of a movie that feels more like Austriathan Belgium? Writer seems to have a thing against Americans,with a scene with three fat Americans and later an American midget.A gun from a friend of Harry's... with a silencer, but Ray wants to kill himself because of killing a little boy while hitting a priest.Some crazy fellers here in Bruges can't get even killing straight.Harry says:""Don't be such a poof"". Gets pretty grim toward the end withblood and chase and all."
1,HATED IT!,"AFTER WATCHING THE PROMO AND READING REVIEWS OF THIS MOVIE, I THOUGHT I WOULD REALLY LIKE IT. BOY, WAS I EVER WRONG! JUST SHORT OF AN HOUR, I TURNED IT OFF. I FOUND IT TO BE SLIGHTLY HUMOROUS IN PLACES, BUT OVERALL ONE OF THE MOST STUPID AND BORING PIECES OF ""BEEP!"" I'VE RENTED IN RECENT MONTHS. I RARELY TURN ANYTHING OFF, BUT THIS FILM WARRANTED IT. I FOUND IT TO BE A TOTAL WASTE OF MY TIME AND MONEY."
1,"Weak Plot, Limited Vocabulary","This is one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time. The plot was disjointed, and the vocabulary boring. How many ways can you use ""f***""? If you need to know, watch this movie. You'll find out how many ways in the first few minutes. These ways will be repeated ad nauseum throughout the movie. The actors were good at convincingly portraying mentally highly-unstable characters: an aging hitman whose prostitute wife was killed in a brothel, a young hitman who botched his first hit and can't get over it, an easy drug-dealing girl, and a bigoted druggie actor dwarf. Yes, it's as bizarre as it sounds. I'm giving this movie one star for the beautiful scenery of Bruges, known in the movie as ""f***in' Bruges""."
1,Bad Tarantino Impression,"The downside of Tarantino's success is we have been awash during the last decade with bad impression of him--""witty"" pop-culture dialogue, multiple plot lines intersecting, violence combined with humor, etc. Other reviewers who think this looks like it could be an ""art"" film didn't actually watch the same film. I think the only reason some liked it is that Americans are the usual target of abuse which is the only thing that consistently pleases film critics. Europeans can be homophobic, bigoted, sexist, etc. but as long as they bash Americans in the process as well it is a ""progressive"" film and critics will automatically approve. But European ""progressivism"" is just a resurgent European nationalism with a thin progressive veneer."
5,Hilarious,"I watched this film On Demand because I had read good reviews. Not a Colin fan, but once I started watching it I couldn't stop laughing. Farrell, Gleeson and Donavan were hysterical. And, it was incredibly witty. If you are a fan of the ""F"" word, Irish dark humor, not so PC jokes, and irony, you love this film. I actually bought it so I could watch it again and so parents and friends could watch it."
4,Enjoyable dark comedy,"I will be the first to admit that this movie is featured in my 3 day workshop titled, ""How Not To Name Your Movie If You Want To Make Any Money."" That said, it's a great film.There is some good comedy, but this this movie is dark. I can't really give good examples without giving away some plot elements, but if you like dark movies then go watch this one right now. Colin Farrell does a great job of playing a likable sort of fellow who might not really be cut out to be a hit man. The film exhibits a good deal of emotion and the ending is simply great. I'm not sure it would fare as well on subsequent viewings, but I'll give it 4 stars for the first one."
4,To the point,This isn't a movie for everyone. Anyone that is picking this up based on the blurbs that it is a comedy might want to pause. It is in fact a comedy...a dark comedy and that isn't for everyone. So don't watch it thinking it's a movie Adam Sandler or Will Ferrell could have been in. It's not that. It's violent. It's fun. It has a good story. And....it is very funny in a dark way.
1,Long and boring,"Rented this movie due to the star studded cast. The previews made it look like a laugh a minute comedy. Not really sure if I laughed at all. The acting was pretty good, but the directing lacked alot. Its probably worth renting, but I wouldn't buy it."
1,not what it said it would be,"the discription for this movie made it sound like a funny/quirky action movie. it is slightly funny in small bits, in a morbid sort of way. and there is some action here and there, that is quite gory, but over all you are left feeling dissapointed and depressed. not what i'm looking for in a comedy, even a dark comedy."
1,Boring and not funny,"Colin can't act, no matter how big his eyebrows are. This movie is billed as a comedy action thriller but it's not funny, the action is boring, and I'm not thilled. If it's going to be so watered down, then they should have at least put a little effort into the plot...or added monkeys, lots of monkeys."
1,just let me do my thing,I saw a trailer for this movie which made it look like a very funny dark comedy and on the DVD cover it has these reviews saying how funny it is but it's actually a boring black comedy. Not too much really happens through most of the film except for the 2 hitmen touring around Bruges and getting into some minor situations and then their boss goes their to kill one of them for accidentaly shooting a kid. There is almost no action except for a little chase scene on foot towards the end which would've been okay if the dialoge would have been better. There are a few funny lines here and there through the movie but not that many and I mostly chuckled and only laughed outloud once or maybe twice also they talk pretty low so I had to turn it up loud. The only really good thing was the scenery of Bruges which is very nice.I wouldn't recommend this but I do recommend seeing the trailer because it had most of the funny parts in it and you get to miss out on all the boring stuff.
1,Please Do Not Purchase This Film!,"After seeing the trailer for In Bruges, hearing some good reviews from friends, and reading some rather excellent reviews here on Amazon, I thought this film would be a sure thing. It made me a bit uneasy that Colin Farrell was in it, because I have never enjoyed his work in anything ever, but I figured I would give it a shot.Please do not purchase this film. Not only did I not laugh one single time, I didn't even crack a smile. I honestly had no idea what I was supposed to find funny in this picture. Is it that a child gets shot in the head or the endless amount of midget jokes or maybe it's that Colin Farrell's acting talent is equal to that of a burlap sack filled with rusty doorknobs.I have never written a review for anything before here on Amazon, but this movie was so terrible that I feel obligated to."
4,Hilarious film marred by terrible trailer,"The Bottom Line:In Bruges is a hilariously-written and acted movie about two incredibly different Irish hitmen hiding out in a Belgian tourist city that's far far better than the previews indicated; with perfect comic performances by Colin Farrell, Brendan Gleeson, and Ralph Fiennes, this is a very good movie whose ending admittedly wraps things up a tad too neatly but remains very watchable and very good.3/4"
3,Dark,A dark psychological thriller with bits of comedy thrown in. If you liked 7 Psychopaths or Fargo you will probably like this one.
2,Way Too Contrived,"There are some very good things about this film. The acting, for one. The setting, for another. The cinematography, for a third. Maybe the music. But that's it. In all other respects, the movie fails. What, exactly, is it? A comedy? A tragedy? A spoof of gangster films? The jokes about ""in Bruges"" become stale. Fast. The ""midget"" jokes likewise. And, what is most disappointing, is that the plot is soooooooo contrived! Nothing happens as it would: it happens in a way that is convenient for the plot. Characters speak after they should by all accounts be dead (and this happens more than once). Somebody who is running for his life makes his body as large a target as possible for the killer chasing him. Everybody conveniently knows everybody else. Contrived. Unsatisfying."
3,Distracted (Unfortunately),"In Bruges sports some of my favorite actors and they mostly live up to their reputation. It's an interesting film in that it deals with some deep emotions well and by the end the slow pace of the film allows an empathy that isn't normally a part of movies like this. I enjoyed the film all the way through, including the ending.The only reasons I can't fully recommend the film are the amazing amount of foul language in the film, the squirting / splashing blood, and the use of drugs in a comical way. I don't mind language, blood or even drugs in a film but I think they need to push the story forward. In this case, it detracted from the story.I know not everyone will be bothered by this. But I'm sharing this just for those who may be. Sure its rated R but there are degrees.All in all, a captivating story with some over the top language and gore."
4,Soul Destruction,"The Almighty's second album is a big improvement in songwriting and production terms over their debut Blood Fire and Love, and is probably their best, before they jumped on the Grunge bandwagon. Its a good old fashioned denim and leather hard rock album with a couple of slow numbers. Musically its similar to other British hard rock bands of the early 90s like Wolfsbane, but a bit harder. The lyrics focus on songwriter Ricky Warwick's twin preocupations of Love and Religion and indeed the track ""Love Religion"" pretty much sums up the albums theme. There are plenty of rocking riffs, gutsy vocals and catchy corus's on offer. ""Crucify"", ""Free'n'Easy"" and ""Devil's Toy"" are stand out tracks."
4,Fairly useful resource,"This book is ideal for children, first time hamster owners, or people looking for basic information. The illustrations are delightful. This book will tell you all you need to know about keeping your hamster (cage, nutrition, ailments), but it is not the be-all and end-all of hamster information. If this is the only hamster book you will ever buy, or you are looking to introduce a child to keeping hamsters, this one is ideal. For someone with higher reading level, or for someone looking more in-depth information, it would be best to pass on this one."
1,They like wheels,"That's about what you'll get from this simple book. Good for little kids, but even they should get something with a little more good info."
2,Interesting,"Not being a scientist Mr. Fumento basically describes himself in this book; ""as not only grossly ignorant, but arrogant as well."" He wrote this book well. But not being a scientific expert, I would not take his words too seriously. What it did make me do is look further into the many definitions he has for clusters, epidemiology, etc.He does explain why and how studies and statistics with regards to the studies are done, and that I found interesting and well put.This is not a scientific journal, but a laymans opinions. He is not a PhD, but an attorney. However, I believe there is a lot of good information in his book. You just know when you read it, you need to look much, much further."
3,Not bad at all...,"The 1st track will get you groovin' fo'sure...Track 8 is also a favourite. Its got that old-school vibe to it. Overall, not a bad CD at all. Check it out.."
5,Love the album!!!!!!,There was a song I used to hear on the radio and i finally found it in this album and i will continue to enjoy it forever!!! Love his deep voice.
3,It's O.K.,"Good music, but nothing especially fresh here. Artists like Maxwell, K'jon, Anthony Hamilton, India.Arie, Jill Scott and Laura Izabor remain well ahead of the curve presented here.Check out the old skool Last Poets if you're into spoken word--and don't forget brotha Gil Scott-Heron. He's still THE bomb.""Ain't No Sunshine"" is interesting. But, again, in my view, it's bringing nothing new to the table."
1,Not for the beginner,"The book is not designed for beginners despite being published in a series called ""Teach Yourself"". The authors specify the target audience as ""Those who have some exposure to C++"". It is misleading not to have this reflected in the book's title. Perhaps the previous reviewer gave it 5* because he had the prerequisite experience.As a beginner I found the book to be of little use. It has been published in a series that I would assume is for the beginner and so I have given it 1*. If you have some experience in VC++ and want to transfer your skills to the .NET environment you might find this book useful?"
2,Full strength? Childrens allergy medicine?,"It is certainly (generic Benadryl) Dyphenhydramine Liquid Antihistamine.This products strength is 12.5 mg, per teaspoon.Although packaged well and arrived in new condition, this product is labeled, 'children's allergy medicine.' Had the seller included this information in the product description, I would not have purchased the item. I am an adult and require full strength medication."
1,MUSIC BOX music not soundtrack music,I made the mistake of ordering this CD. It contains renditions performed on a music box NOT the actual soundtracks.
2,Very disappointed,"Be warned - this is a collection of music in MUSIC BOX STYLE. SOME FINE SONGS ARE REPRESENTED, BUT THE SOUND IS NOT LIKE THE SOUNDTRACK."
4,Motorola L6 TriBand Unlocked GSM Phone (Pink),The person I purchased it from sent me a manual in german and nothing else and would not send me another. And if I knew that this phone could not be used for anything but phone calls I would not have even looked at it. Other then the phone manual and the complete uselessness of the phone I am a Happy customer.The sales people and Amazon should provide more details about their products for the people who are not up to date or knowledgeable of the products
3,Not fantastic,"Great looking phone, but charger was for a foreign electric outlet and the number keys on the phone are labeled in Arabic. The owners manual was also in arabic. Nothing against arabic, I just can't read it. The buttons are small too and have a tendancy to bump easily, causing me to call people when I don't intend to. The camera is not great either. If I could do it over, I'd buy a razor (my boyfriend has one and I love it)."
4,beginning tonfa,"This video is a beginners guide to stances, blocks, strikes and self defense using the tonfa. It also contains one Kata. The video also shows you the application of each item previously mentioned."
4,Bra in not so common size,Great price for a bra in a size difficult to find in regular store.Only vice I could find is the fact that cups are kind of pointy so you might feel like Madonna in her early days!
5,Oldie but goodie,This bra has been around for many years. It is great for us full busted gals who need a little uplift.
2,Not happy,The product didn't fit right and did not hold breast up at all.Would not recommend this product at all.
4,Holy cone-shaped projectiles batman!,"I'm a 34DDD so I have a heck of a time finding a bra that fits, so I was actually rather surprised that this fit as well as it did. It keeps me firm and upright even when jumping, and is usually pretty comfortable. It does have stabilizers under the arms which can dig in, and I do get sore if I wear it for too long, but this has been regulated to my gym bra, so that isn't a problem. The part I don't like is the fact that my boobs are not only in a full upright position, but also cone-shaped. I'm not shy about pushing myself up a little, but these actually make me look like I was shaped by a funnel."
5,Bali Bra is just right,I had tried this bra in a department store and knew it had a great fit so I decided to shop for it from Amazon.
2,Itchy!,The fabric of this bra is very thin and has a seam running through the center of the cups. The seam is very itchy and not comfortable at all! I'm returning mine.
4,Great Bra - Comfortable & Pretty Support,Love the bra and will order another one soon. Good fit and support (holds things in at the right places!).
1,Wrong all over,"It looks wonderful on the model, but not on me. The lace and seems were itchy, and it created a retro bullet bra silhouette, which if I had been looking for such would be okay. Normally I wear mostly t-shirts, and the occasional sweater. I like a much smoother look than this bra provides."
5,Excellent.,"This is a very nice bra: Good fit and excellent lift. Under-wire do not dig in. I bought two of the,"
2,small cup,"Seems like it would be comfy, but the cup did not have full coverage, as was indicated in the blurb. I had to send it back. Cup was not as large as others that say they are equal to this one."
3,Torpedos Are For Submarines,"After becoming increasingly dissatisfied with the uniboob look of my current minimizer bra, I decided to purchase the Bali Flower Underwire. This bra does provide good support, but alas, digressing from the uniboob to the torpedo look was not my goal when I bought it. I have given the bra three stars for this very reason."
4,Bali review,"Service was fast and efficient. Bras or OK - not quite what I remembered, but satisfactory nevertheless."
5,LOVE IT!,Great fit and super comfortable. Never rides up my back and wide padded shoulder straps are great. Plan on buying several more!
1,"Supportive but pointy, scratchy material","I'm a 32DDD. This bra lift and seperates very well and the band has four rows of hooks. But the cup gives a very pointy shape to the breast. The material feels scratchy as well. If you want to look like Madonna in the cone bra getup, then this is the bra for you."
3,"A bit stiff, but definitely keeps the girls in place","Very nice bra, but the material is a bit stiff, which keeps the girls where they're supposed to be, though. It'll give a pointy shape, which is not very flattering with regular t-shirts, but will add some lift with ""flowy"" tops.BE AWARE: even though it says that this item qualifies for free returns, you will have to pay for the shipping costs if you want to return this bra!!! Amazon customer rep told me it's because the product is not sold/fulfilled by Amazon itself, but by a 3rd party. It puzzles me why Amazon mentions free returns on the product page when it doesn't apply to that specific product. On a product that doesn't cost much, having to pay for return shipping is quite a waste."
4,Great Bra,This bra is a relatively inexpensive alternative to the designer bras I was having to purchase in order to find a small enough band size coupled with a big enough cup size. My only issue is that it does not come in many colors. I would really like a black one.
4,My favorite bra,"I am an odd size, 44B, and this is one bra that actually fits and makes me look good. It hold up reasonably well. I always have a few of this style as I ""experiment"" with other styles."
5,Love it,"The best, just as it was in the advertisement. This is a hard to find size, wuld love to buy more. It arrived in a very timely manner. Very ahppy."
1,very uncomfortable,"first the real product different from what the picture showssecondly, when wearing it, it is very uncomfortable, I can't stand a secondso return it immediately"
5,It's magic !,"Here's a bra which is excellent in every aspect, comfort, uplift, flattery. The magic is that after wearing it for the whole day, you go to unhook it and the back is still in the exact position it was when you put it on. Now this is special. Most bras will ride up a little, or some of them a lot, at the back. This one doesn't and that's amazing."
1,not what I expected,I purchased this bra based solely on the picture and of course name...very disappointed. It is made cheaply and arrived frayed at the seams. Just terrible quality for the price.
2,Not the bra for me!,I should have known better after reading some of the other reviews but I gave it a try anyway. I don't like the pointy look of this bra or really anything about the look at all. It may give good support but I wouldn't want to wear it under anything even slightly see through because of the huge band. It is definitely not what I was looking for. The search continues...
5,Awesome Bra!,"This bra is IT!!I have searched for years, for a bra that actually 'lifts and separates' (LOL!) This one does it! I am very self-conscious about my 40DD size, and this bra really makes them seem MUCH smaller. I will wear this for the rest of my life.Only problem I know of is, after lots of wear (like every day for 5-6 mos.), the under wire has a tendency to pop out, right near the armpit. But I have gone so far as to sew the hole shut, just so I can continue wearing this lovely bra (until I can buy a new one, of course!)I highly recommend this bra if you want to look smaller and 'perkier'. :)"
5,bali bras,"great fit, great quality, decent price. i received it before expected. after i drop another ten pounds i'llpurchase more bras."
5,What a deal,This was perfect. A great savings too. I will purhase more of this product as I need it. Thank you so much.
2,Nice support but strange shape.,I found the bra to be very supportive (I'm a 32D) but I found that it gave my breasts a very pointed look which was very strange under clothes. It also made them seem much smaller. Great support but because of the shaping I returned it.
2,Itchy Bra,"I hate this bra! The material is itchy, even after several washings. The wires poke me all the time and the bra is just generally uncomfortable. I just went back to wearing my old bras and I've given up on these. If you're looking for a comfortable bra, this is not one. The only positive things are: the straps adjust in the front and the color is nice. I simply cannot stand to have this bra on my body."
3,it's ok,it didn't fit right as the other bali bras i have. it appears to be a bit of a smaller fit. it has urged me to lose some weight in order to use it!
2,Never buying Bali again!,"Every single Bali bra I tried has either been uncomfortable or the wrong fit. FYI, a 38DDD in Playtex is apparently a 38D or DD in Bali... Spilled out in every direction in the 38DDD Bali bra."
1,The epitome of you get what you pay for!,"This bra is the epitome of you ""get what you pay for""! This bra is so cheaply made, I am disappointed because I didn't even think Bali would make a bra of this quality! Break open a box of band aids because it is very abrasive! It is also not smooth in front, it is POINTY! Reminds me of the bras my mother used to wear!"
5,"Comfortable, holds things tight","First got this bra when my daughter was doing a performance with a lot of jumping around. Her bra wasn't making it, and we looked for one better. Found this, perfect. Due to the non elastic straps, and the fine support, this bra holds things in place all day long, better than any other bra I have ever owned. My daughter and I are both well developed. Most bras are challenged when it comes to supporting us, except this one. It is also very comfortable. You know it's on, but it never hurts. It also puts your chest in a good position, not spread out but forward. Looks very flattering. Truly great support, and pretty."
1,Very uncomfortable,I have purchased Bali bras before and have always been satisfied. This bra pokes and is very poorly made. This will make me question the brand itself.
1,Of Plastic Material and not comfortable,"This was one of the bras that you throw away the minute you try them on! I was disappointed, the material is extremely rigid and extremely uncomfortable.."
3,required by doc for B.A.,"i'm use to wearing VS bras but for surgery my doc wanted me to purchase this specific bra and remove the wire till I heal, it's not so bad but the quality of it seems kind of cheap compared to VS. Since its required by my doc its ok but personally I wouldn't want to wear these grandma looking bras."
2,Not for me...,"I chose this low rating because this bra is highly structured and not made for comfort. It's not right for me, but others may like and choose this type of bra. It reminded me of the 1960's."
1,not worth even the low price,doesn't actually hold the roll when you pull on it. go ahead and spend more for a better one.
2,Yecchh!,"If interracial relationships, seemingly unending harangues, and horrendously long sentences excite you, then this book is for you! I couldn't wait to finish it. Good luck!!"
1,Waste of Time,"Of the hundreds of books that I have read, this was the all-time second worst.The plot is barely coherent - the characters are both depressing and fogetable - and the author tries to weave a tale in a babbling fashion."
3,Stories,"Samaritan is a 400 page confessional of lives gone wrong, lives wrecked and semi-salvaged. To help is to expose yourself to more grief than any man can deal with. Ray, returning to the projects he grew up in with a pocketful of money, never fully materializes. We know him as a doubter (doubts almost every thought that he has) but his moves seems passive. Ray gets coerced into making his offers, manipulated, even by his young daughter. He is a watcher and a story spinner, but he doesn't have enough strength to drive the narrative. Samaritan is more of a Whydunnit than Whodunnit. Price is interested in the psychology of white/black, adult/child, rich/poor. Still, the weaknesses are hard to see since Price writes beautifully. The depiction of the bleak urban landscape is worth the cost of 'Samaritan', but this book neither approaches the plotting of 'Clockers' nor evokes the pity and despair found in 'Freedomland'."
5,Richard Price stays on target,"I eagerly await every book by Richard Price. Samaritan was no exception. I appreciate his consistency - I have never been disappointed in any of his books. His characters always have rich inner lives and his plot line always keep the reader interested. In the back of my head, through the whole book, was the idea that the benefactor most loved by God is anonymous. This book reinforces that lesson. Highly recommended. Those of you who have not read any of his other books are in for a treat."
1,Brevity is NOT the soul of wit,Why abridge an already short detective story? It renders it incoherent and diminishes the enjoyment of following the twists and turns of the story. Sham on Random House audio -- and on the author for allowing this travesty. Brevity is no virtue when it comes to audio books!
2,Tame,"Sadly this book is forgettable. The author leaves you constantly waiting for the book to begin but it never really does. The buildup is continuous, and when the climax comes it's not worth the wait. The characters tended to be very rigid. Clockers is a much better book."
3,"Sparkling dialogue, Interesting Characters, So-So Plot","I have to give Richard Price credit for creating realistic characters with dialogue that crackles and feels painfully real coming from this group of broken people. However by the time I finished I was left wanting more. The mystery surrounding who beat one time television writer and now teacher Ray Mitchell to death left me a bit cold. And when the person is revealed I can't even say I was surprised, but worse I didn't really care. I loved the book at the start and was expecting to tap into something I'd be telling eveyone to go out and buy. Again I thought the writing was great, I just didn't completely connect with this group of people, and so ultimately didn't connect with the book."
2,Everything looks funny,"You put this thing on your phone and three things happen.It turns into a mirror 95% of the time when you are using.When you can look at your phone, everything is weird looking and straining on the eyes (weird, distroted colors)The touch screen becomes less sensitive.The only reason I gave this two stars is because the mirror is useful."
5,Easily the best Pat Benatar compilation out there,"I own both ""Synchronistic Wanderings"" and ""Pat Benatar Greatest Hits"", and I must say ""Synchronistic Wanderings"" does a much better job of covering her career. If you're unsure of which to get, go with this more inclusive collection. For only a few more dollars you can get this collection (used), but you get two extra CD's worth of material, including rarities and tracks from her 90's albums ""True Love"" and ""Gravity's Rainbow"", not to mention a biographical booklet with commentary by Pat and Neil (her husband/guitarist).Also, some of the tracks from her ""Greatest Hits"" album have been shortened by a few seconds to fit as many songs as possible into one CD. It's only a minor annoyance, but an annoyance nonetheless. On this collection all the songs are their original length.""Synchronistic Wanderings"" is a great collection, by one of the greatest rock singers of our time."
4,kentucky headhunters,Great artist! I woud recomend this to all music lovers. Pirates of the Mississippi i have missed you glad to find it
5,Brian on the Rise,"Brian McFadden was a key figure at Westlife and any fan of the Irish pop group would provide testimony to this fact. This singer was always harmonising well with his group members and his voice lent a touch of serenity and sentimentality to the love ballads that have become the symbols of the boyband. But his decision to go solo did raise some eyebrows but sngles after singles released from his debut album ""Irish Son"" have gone a good length to mitigate those apprehensions. Here we focus on the title-track of the album and what a marvellous one it is indeed! It's flooded with patiotic elements and the appealing voice of Brian McFadden draws a shade of lingering sensuality by a brush of nationalism. ""Irish Son"" is a fantasticsong that would beguile music lovers of all ages."
5,Irish Son is a great surprise,"I live in the USA and although I heard of the group Westlife, it was not music I listened to. But one day I was on the internet searching the UK charts for new music and came across Irish Son by Brian Mcfadden. I was immediately a fan. I looked for more songs of his. His sound is fresh and every song on the album is one I can listen to. Normally you are lucky to have two songs that you want to listen to over and over. This album is full of songs you can listen to and it never gets boring. I know some people bash him because of his past boyband connections, but Brian has grown into a great artist. I hope he soon hits the USA with a tour. I would love to see a show. Thanks Amazon for selling his CD."
5,A Pinnacle,"Mots D'Heures: Gousses, Rames is one of the greatest literary entertainments ever written. It runs the gamut from touchingly nostalgic to raucous. Above all, it is howlingly funny. It makes me laugh so hard it hurts.You need two things to enjoy Mots D'Heures: Gousses, Rames. You should know some French, and you should know some nursery rhymes. With that, the book will hit you from line to line with waves of jaw-dropping hilarity, endless wit, and moments of poignant reminiscence.There is nothing more to say except: bah, six boucs! [The author apparently thinks you should pay six goats---or a sheep?]Update -- Having unguardedly purchased a copy of the paperback edition listed above, I must agree with a recent reviewer that the production is dreadful. A reader interested in this masterwork would do well to seek out a copy of the original 1967 edition (long out of print), even at considerable cost. But not from me, though. I wouldn't part with mine for less than tartines fortunes."
3,Nice Folk Mix,"There is a nice mix of traditional Polish Folk songs on this CD. What really sets it apart is the CD booklet which has short stories for each of the songs. Many of the songs' stories connect to each other, so the CD is almost like a storybook."
2,I tried,I like squid. I like sugar. I like salt. I don't like them combined with MSG. It has an awful aftertaste.
2,so nasty....,I agree with other review about the bad aftertaste. I've tried a few different brands and this is hands down the worst one. It leaves a chemical kinda taste that can only be removed by eating or drinking something else right after. You've been warned!!
5,it good,it smell good fresh when you open ithas jerky / rubbery textureand it plenty squidy tasten but witha little draw back though it sweet as crazybutif your inersted in anything diffrent than the usealjunk food you should go foree za sqiud jerky look at the bag it so &#12363;&#12431;&#12356;&#12356; !!!
2,Too Sweet,"I didn't know what to expect when I ordered this - I love squid, and I love beef jerky, so I might like this.I didn't. It was very, very sweet and made my fingers smell like the fish food I fed my fish.I could have handled it if it wasn't for the fact that once I bit into it, a strange, sugary liquid gathered in the back of my mouth. Swallowing that liquid was a chore, because it just tasted so bad!"
2,"Just like jerky, but fishy","Chewy like jerky, but fishy. Make sure to have a bottle of mouthwash or a pack of gum when you eat this stuff, because it leaves a stink in your mouth."
1,Too sweet,"Disgustingly sweet. I was expecting squid, not candied squid!The packaging was sort of weird too.Hopefully the hot version is better..."
2,One of the worst Scooby Doo's ever!!!!!!,We rented this so my daughter who is 3 could watch this. Scooby is hardly in it. Fred isn't BLONDE!!!!! The chick that plays Daphne may be young but with red hair she looks to be almost 30 and not a teenager like the rest of the cast. Everyone of the characters starts to have a romance. Fred and Daphne are making out in like the first 10 minutes. Then they discuss whether or not they are together. Shaggys pining for Velma gets old fast. They also do a little barbershop song and it screams cheese. Glad we rented this instead of buying it. Not at all like the original live animation Scooby Doo. Very Very Very Disappointed.
1,Fail: Would not buy.,"This Scooby Doo Movie has a poorly developed story, awful dialogue, and wooden acting that you see in most of the modern made-for-kids TV movies. It has nothing in common with the animated series and lacks a since of style and entertainment."
1,Where are you Scooby Doo!,"Scooby is MIA in this movie. I did like the first movie with this cast and I even chuckled here and there, but Scooby is essential since the main title is SCOOBY DOO!I don't know, Daphne seemed too old for her part and with a little bump on the tummy. I think she might be pregnat in those parts. Am I right?"
4,A pretty good sequel,"Suprisingly I loved the 1st one, the direct-to-cartoon-network movie, Scooby Doo: The Mystery Begins. Other then some poor graphics, it was great for a tv movie! This ones graphics were better, but I found the script not as engaging. Still pretty good, worth the watch for any Scooby fan!"
5,Scooby Doo - Everyone Loves Scooby,I have been watching Scooby since 1970 and I was so excited to introduce my children to Scooby. All Scooby movies are so much fun to watch and this movie is no different. Fix a bowl of popcorn and start the movie!
1,Save your money... Complete flop,"I realize it is a kid's movie and I bought it for our 7 year old daughter. She loves Scooby Doo and had to have the new movie. Normally I see her busting a gut over Scooby, which she did with the Scooby-Doo/Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed. She only laughed from time to time with this movie. Acting is horrible, the characters do not fit with the typical scooby characters. Why does Fred have brown hair? What is with the lovefest between the characters. Not mention I thought it was a Scooby movie, his role is not as big as one might believe.Please save your money but if you must see it, use Amazon Instant Videohttp://www.amazon.com/Scooby-Doo-Curse-Lake-Monster/dp/B004Q8K28C/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-video&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1299641838&sr;=1-1"
1,Jinkies,"..Please,Please bring back the Actors from 1&2 - Although I thought 1 was a little scary for younger ones- They were sooooooo much more entertaining.....much like scooby doo cartoons.This was so hard to watch - like snoozeville man.I will be much more carefull if there is another release before I buy."
1,stunk,never make three this was the worst did not like it at all. would not recomend it unless you got kids the story like stunk.
1,Waste of time and money,This couldn't even keep the attention of my seven year old! Stick with the original cartoons if you want to watch Scooby-Doo
1,This... is NOT Scooby Doo...,"I'm sorry, but no one but the kid playing Shaggy looked, dressed or sounded like they should. (Not to mention, he was the only one who didn't come across like he was acting in a low-budget, made-for-Nickelodeon TV series.) (They were also not WRITTEN properly.) My sons, who ADORE Scooby Doo, kept asking, ""Who are those people with Shaggy and Scooby?"" And, when someone would say the names, they'd be like, ""Nu-uh, that's not Daphne!"" or ""That's not Fred!"" And, why bother hooking Fred and Daphne up and Shaggy/Velma up just to break them up? That's... that's just MEAN to the fans."
2,Awful,"This Scooby-Doo was very bad. Not at all like the first one, very weird. Velma and Scooby were not in it very much. It had to much romance. It was very random. I do not suggest buying it."
5,plus one is so incredible,"OH my gosh!! plus one is the best thing to hit music in a long time!! they are five guys, so they appeal to many people, they have incredible voices and harmonies. THey have such an amazing, true, life changing message, of God's amazing love, to share with the whole world!!"
5,I'm Amazed!,"Plus One has definitely deserved it's rank of 5 stars for it's debut album. Pesonally, since I am also a big Nsync fan, I think Plus one is a good choice. Turn this up high on your walkman an you are definitely cool! My favorite song is "" My Life"" because it sounds really almost secular. Hey, who nows, they could show up on MTV and your local Top 40 station with their romance single "" Last Flight Out"". This song is also the best romantic slow song I have ever heard. Buy this CD, and share it with your friends, especially if they are not Christian. Live the Christian Pop way with Plus One today!"
3,I dont like them,"Sure it sounds good,it has a good beat,and some of there songs have good messages,but Plus One just wants the ""world"" to like them. I think they need to start thinking what God thinks instead of the ""world""."
3,5 stars?,"there are several CDs that actually deserve 5 stars. the beatles? maybe. U2? maybe them too. but not this CD. i'm sorry, but 5 stars is definitely on exaggeration. Even if you base it on the fact that it's a teen pop CD, it would not match up against most other pop CDs out there. there were several songs on this CD that were good, but they weren't great. if you're younger, you might like it. but if you want a CD that'll last for a long time, look for something different."
1,Be a gospel superstar for Jesus!,"Wow, christian music has really gone downhill with this CD! Trying desperately to cash in on the boy band craze! Please! This is not what Jesus would consider spreading any kind of a message ""to all the world to preach the gospel."" Christian music is tripe! It's all commercialized, packaged in a nice plastic case and is prettied up by a bunch of people who claim themselves annointed! Steer clear folks!"
3,The Promise is a very good cd!,"I bought this album yesterday because I am a big fan of NSYNC, Backstreet Boys, 5ive, etc. and I also listen to Christian Contemporary music. The first song Written On My Heart is amazing! It could be recorded by NSYNC or any other. The rest of the album is very good, although there are a few tracks that have great lyrics, but the music isn't very well written..i lost interest and quickly fast forwarded."
2,Nothing Special,"Plus One is nothing special. And just because they're a Christian band doesn't automatically make them ""good."" Songs such as ""Written on My Heart"" and ""The Promise"" seem as if they're trying too hard to convey the boy band image. Their sound is nothing new. I'm so sick of bands like Plus One."
5,Wow! Breath taking!!,"When I first heard Plus One, I was driving in my car w/my cousin and mother, and it just blew me away! Their music is just awsome! The lerics of their songs are just mainly giving praise to God. I got to meet/hang out w/the guys bout a week ago, and their just some awsome group of people! All they want is for Jesus to be praised! So, if you don't have their CD, I really suggest that you get it!!"
5,PLUS ONE RULES!,"Plus One is a awesome group! I met them just a few days ago and they treated everybody just so incredibly SWEET! They are in it for God and just want to serve Him! They were just in a magizine, and they are just incredible guys! I really respect them! All the songs on the Promise are WONDERFUL! The songs just have great beats and wonderful lyrics about how God Loves you and will be right by you in hard and good times! If you like the sound of Backstreet Boys or N'sync but you do not like the lyrics. I will highly recommend this album! To find out more information on Plus One got ....... I Love you Plus One!"
4,Great Music : Inspired by the Holy Spirit,"I'm a guy, and usually I can't stand boy bands with high pitched voices. but once I heard Plus 1 in my youth pastors car I knew I had to have the CD. I was really suprised there music and lyrics were totally inspired by the holy spirit, If you feel a little down please get this CD and let God speak to you."
5,When your spirit gets too weak,I have to say this album is my favorite. My friends and I can always get happy after listening to this c.d.! The words of the songs always lift me up! I am happy to say that if you buy this c.d. it will be in your c.d. player at all times!
5,AWESOME,This CD fits right in with what is being played today. No longer do we need to hide listening to Christian music. It is cool. Great work!
4,Finally something I can listen to with my kids!,"I love there sound and content. It is so refreshing to hear 5 young boys not singing about sex,violence,drugs ect. I can listen with my four year old, and my pre-teen nieces. Plus One actually has lyrics the kids can sing to that don't clutter there little minds with things they shouldn't even be repeating. Thank you to David Foster for putting together this awesome group! (And to the boys!) Keep your focus...upward!"
5,Finally Christian Music Doesn't Have To Take a Back Seat,"Watch out, Backstreet Boys and N Sync, here comes Plus One! ""Written In My Heart"" is as good as any Backstreet song or N'Sync song, maybe better. The harmonies are great throughout the album, with some songs being better than others. Musically, the group still could use some improvement, but as a debut album this was phenomenal. The lyrics were well thought out and Foster did a wonderful job producing this. Whoever did the photographs in the cover did a great job as well. It is only a matter of time before these guys crack the top 50, and I am not talking about Christian music, either. Why let the devil get all the good music, as Larry Norman once said."
5,Sweet,"This CD hasn't left my player for at least two weeks. Picking it up spontaneously for ""Written on My Heart"", I've marveled at tight vocal harmonies, exceptional ranges, peppy, motivating songs and lyrics that speak to worlds to me. I'm not one to go for the whole ""boy band"" thing, but this group of guys have garnered my respect. I would suggest slipping this in your teenager's CD player, and see if they don't love it more than 'NSync or the Backstreet Boys."
4,+1 beats Backstreet Boys and barely trails *NSync,"As an loyal fan of boy bands, I pay close attention to what is out there. As a Christian, I am always looking for entertaining Christian music. Plus One has exceeded simple entertainment; their CD has smooth music with valuable and inspiring lyrics. The best part about their group is that they incorporate the ""girls"" issue and God in the same songs - making the CD more familiar to their intended audience - and making it particularly romantic. This CD has without question outdone Backstreet Boys in every category; BSB is going out quickly because they just can't seem to get it right. *N Sync, on the other hand, does everything right. As a close second, Plus One doesn't seem to be making any mistakes either. On the contrary, they are moving in the perfect direction to becoming equal if not better than the best existing boy band, *NSync."
3,Some left to be desired,"First off I would like to bring attention to the fact that if you are looking for a good Christian ""boy band"", you need to be aware of that fact that not all songs on this CD are Christ-oriented.Gabe (from Plus One)is quoted from an interview in Brio Magazine: ""We're human. We have emotions we like to sing about - most of them toward God - but we also have emotions for girls that express our love for them. We all have relationships, and we like to sing about those sometimes."" Yes, that may be true, but does it have to happen on a Christian CD?Don't get me wrong, these guys sound GREAT, and are very sincere about their faith! However, if they want to do secular, generally depressing songs, I suggest they do it on another CD."
4,Blessed by God,"Truly a God sent even a mom of my age (43) loves this cd as well as my 7 year old. I love every song on this cd but my most favorite is ""When Your Spirit Gets Weak"" wow this lifts my spirit every time. Thanks Plus One your a God sent."
5,plus one:THE BOMB!,"I just got the CD.I absolutely loved it!the song ""My Life"" sounded exactly like N SYNC or BACKSTREET BOYS.I think that they have beaten them by far!"
3,Mediocre at best,"I found the singing voices immature. The harmonies ranged from adequate to not-so-good. The arrangements weren't reaaly inspiring. Several of the songs were okay, but I wouldn't personally recommend the album."
2,Does not fit together!,"I wanted this lamp so bad! I read the reviews on the problems with putting it together. I followed the reviewer comments and spent an hour and a half trying my best to put this together. I even concocted a written ""grid"" with every possible way of combining the lights. To no avail. It appears that two of the ""screw on"" holders on the base were at the exact same angle, so two poles were leaning into one another. It didn't matter whether I had short, medium, or large. This was a shame, as I wanted this lamp for my desk. Returned it and received a credit very fast. Went out to the local big box and bought a lamp to replace. I really liked the design. **ADDITIONAL INFO** Save the box it came in. I threw it out and had to spend $13 at a UPS center for shipping and packing the box. What a waste! My fault though.... Amazon included the shipping return fee which worked out great, other than the expense of the box."
5,love the lights,"Great lamp. It is a bit tricky to set up, but with a tad of patience you will get it and it works very nicely. There is a built in reostat on the plug that will allow you to dim the lights to any range of light you want in the bulbs spectrum. The frosted glass gives the bulbs a nice look that is not blinding and the metal is of good quality, meaning that it is not thin or it does not have defects in the metal anywhere I could see. I will buy another one for sure."
5,Love it!,I bought two of these for the nightstands. They are beautiful and give off great light. The dimmer is a plus. The only thing is they are a little hard to put together but by reading one person's review it helped greatly. You have to make sure you line of the groves perfectly before screwing in the tubes. They also send an extra bulb and glass which is a bonus as well.
3,Very dificult to assemble - more clear intstructions needed!,It took me two hours to assemble this lamp. The problem is that the instruction picture is not the same as the one on amazon. You really don't know which piece fits where. I ended up being very frustrated. Hopefully this reviews are read by the company so that they can improve their instructions and send us new and very clear one. The only good thing about the light is that it has dim control and it looks nice but it still doesn't look as nice as on the picture shown on amazon.
1,Disintegrated when I was assembling it,"I have returned this lamp because one of the electrical connections fell apart as I was assembling it. Specifically, the plastic covering of one of the connections of the electrical wires in one of the poles (which has to be screwed onto the base) simply fell off leaving a bare wire. Needless to say, I was not impressed with the quality of the product and will not be ordering another."
1,Pretty but not usable,"Although this lamp is very pretty, I had to return it because it was impossible to assemble correctly. The glass shades leaned on one another to the point that the shades were actually bowing. It would have been only a matter of time before the glass shades shattered from the pressure or exploded from the heat generated by the shades touching one another. Don't buy this lamp."
3,ok psych,"overall, this is a rather pedestrian release culled from outtakes and scrap material. rosemary's baby and woodrose syrup are good tracks, but some of this is poorly recorded and other things are just rather dull. i would instead suggest that you track down their awesome 1968 ep. this can be found on the berkeley eps cd, and is a better testament to their powers. all three tracks on that ep are really excellent and remind one to some degree of moby grape and quicksilver messenger service.this isn't a terrible recording but it isnt as good as one would hope for after hearing their ep."
2,Basic Main Street American Eats,"The book covers one or two sandwiches from each state with interesting period, black-and-white photos of street scenes, which are mostly from the 1920s - 1950s. There are no photos of the sandwiches. The recipes are almost too primitive - greasy-spoon more than main-street diner. Not much to learn here."
3,This is good but the DVD is better,There is an even better DVD for this play that has all the same sort of stuff that this has and a performance. Check it out. It's easy to understand the play because they explain it in modern english and there's this thing that lets you look up words while you're watching the DVD. You can get it here at Amazon. It's the one directed by J. Bretton Truett and EJ Kerwin. I bought it and these Cliff's Notes and the DVD had way better stuff and it was easier to use when I was studying for a test for this play.
4,Four Stars,"VOICES CARRY is the first Mariah Stewart book I have read. The cleverly suspenseful plot was entertaining and the characters believeable. I especially liked that Genna Snow was as smart, if not smarter, than her male counterparts. Often when the lead female character and the lead male character work for the FBI or some other exciting government position, the male character seems to always be smarter and more intuitive than the female character. The author did a great job of bringing out the professional strenghts of Genna and John and the understandable romantic tension between them. You won't go wrong purchasing this book."
4,Mariah never disappoints,"Mariah never disappoints her readers. I found this book to be as great as all her others. Her characters are believable and so are her story lines. I highly recommend this book and any of her others. Having read one, you also will be ""hooked""."
3,see below,"I'm a big Mariah Stewart fan so enjoy anything she writes, however,this was not one of my favorites. Good Bye"
4,Voices Carry,good condition and came to me very fast. As they said it would. Thank You and I would buy from you again.
5,Entertaining and Educational,"I was delighted to come across Heroes and She-roes. This book cleverly introduces children to many of the most inspiring characters from history and today using poetry to tell their stories. Greats like Joan of Arc, Gandhi, and Rosa Parks are covered along with heroes and she-roes children will recognize from today such as firemen and teachers. The beautiful illustrations throughout make these figures come alive, and the poetry format is an excellent tool for helping kids learn and remember the significance of the characters. This book would be a great addition to any home or classroom."
5,Armenia's Past & Present,This album combines the best of both worlds in terms of Armenian music. It is performed with a choral group and musical instruments. It has the old musical mountain instruments and it uses new instruments. The creative orchestration gives new sounds to some old country songs. The new songs add depth and create a pleasant listening experence.
2,"Nice album, but not the original","I used to own the original LP of Armenian Festival years ago, and I was very happy to see it available on Amazon; however, the album offered here is not the original, it's a combination of several LPs. There is a track missing from the original album and I don't know why."
2,Pretty standard,"I bought this disc after hearing one track that I liked and the samples seemed alright but after a few listens it's just sat on the shelf. Whereas after buying Leading Vision at the same time at Amazon's persistent recommendation with nothing to go on but the samples, I wound up enjoying and listening to my blind purchase much more. This CD has a few stand out guitar and drum solos but much less than many metal bands. Certainly more thrash than death metal. And as another reviewer stated, most tracks are almost indistinguishable from the others. I would not buy this again if I knew then..."
4,I don't find it Abominable at all. :),"this adventure marks the first appearance of the robotic Yeti creatures, as well as a mysterious alien force known only as the Great Intelligence. I did find this adventure most enjoyable, despite certain inaccuracies that were made in regards to the Tibetan monks."
1,Poorly written term paper,"Initially I was excited by this book because of its straight forward advice and recommendations. Upon reading the book, though, I found it full of typos, editorial mistakes, and out-dated information. It would be worth a read if it were a few dollar PDF download, but otherwise is a waste of time."
2,A Book for Newbies....,"I ordered this book without having read the excerpts that are now posted on Amazon. I was pretty disappointed. I should note that I work on search engine performance issues as a part of my job. Passages of the book are totally out of date and useless - example being the pay-for-click section dealing with goto.com (which is now out of business). This is a book for newbies and even then, will only be relevant in certain areas (HTML metatags for example). Best to save your money and do your research on the 'net since search engine performance is a topic that changes frequently."
3,Good starting point.,"Chandra provides a good very basic foundation to Search Engine positioning, a good understanding of how search engine positioning works. However, there's not much detail for the person looking to take action."
1,Very basic,"This book is so basic as to be unbelievable. It is also incredibly badly written ... if I was offered the option to publish it through my publishing company ... I would have rejected it without even reading more than the first 10 pages.Although not certain, the book looks and feels as though it is self-published ... the diagrams are all poor quality and unclear and the whole book is printed on A4 paper.If it was possible to give minus stars this would get -5 ..."
1,Definately poorly written,This book claims to be somthing close to a internet marketing topic. Alas! It is not. Looks and Feels like a term paper.I've only wated my money for that !!!!
4,"""A MUST READ BOOK"" for anyone looking to get to the top!","Mr. Sekhar has a firm grasp on what it takes in getting to the top of the search engines. Web Genius has a search engine team of 47 professional search engine positioners ALL WHO AGREE that this is a book that has many important trade secrets to get those all-important top rankings on the major search engines. -Peter Stein CEO, WebGenius.com"
3,Good Search engines tips,"This book works! As simple as that.The the book is about three topics - search engines, search engines and search engines .The book describes many new things on the search engines .Other than the topics related to searchengines,""accessorial information"" about internet marketing are mediocre.The book should have been aptly called as "" Search engine positioning - A ""Do It Yourself"" guide."
1,No more Coby for me,"I live in Key West, FL so rarely make the 3hr drive to miami. I was up there at BrandSmartUSA and saw the Coby DVD R1100 (new version of the R1000) for $148 new. I had wanted one for some time so thought this was my chance. I got it home and got all hooked up, ready to see what recording quality was like....but never got that far since the DVD tray won't open! I tried resetting, turning off power, etc. I looked on their website for suggestions but nothing. I am not contacting customer service since they have inconvenient hours Mon-Fri only. I have to head back up to miami tomorrow so not passing up the chance to return it to miami so I can wait to talk to a tech next Mon that's going to want me to return it anyway."
4,nice piece of jewelry,"i really like this pendant. looks very retro and attractive. i got lot's of compliments wearing it. comes with double silver chain that is really nice also. the only cons is that is shallow at the back. you see only nice round finish at the front, but since the pendant is big there is no chance that will flip over to the back side when worn."
2,For beginners only,"This vidoe is slow moving. It is hard to understand the instructor, as his english is ruff and the sound is not the best. The demonstration,however are set-up so that any novice or beginner can easily start trainning. There is even a full Kama Kata that can be practiced. My advice is after watch it the first time review it with the sound off and the remote in hand."
4,"Good Compilation, but...","Other reviews have pointed out that this is a good set for the casual, rather than die hard fan, and I would agree. Of course, concept tracks like Thick as a Brick and Passion Play were necessarily truncated. My biggest gripe is the utter lack of liner notes. Given the significance and history of this band, the least Chrysalis/Capitol could have done was a decent booklet. Other than that, it's a decent package."
1,I can't get it to download,I have not been able to download this mpm album to my windows media player. It says it cann't recognize .amz. I'm about to start downlaoding from I tunes instead.
5,top expectation,"Buying a used cd is always a bit touchy but I sure was not disapointed with my purchase as the seller was very honest,I recommend highly."
4,good compilation,"A pretty good representation of the career of Ian Anderson. I wish he had a boxed set that only contained their first 5 albums like the Steely Dan set. Like most rockers, the best stuff was done when they were young and hungry."
4,Everything You Could Expect.,"This is a fine collection of the thoughts and witticisms of William F Buckley. It covers most any area that Mr. Buckley holds an Interest whether it be politics, social affairs, sailing, classical music and spending time with dignitaries and well to do people. It is fantastically written (as can be expected from Buckley) however it seemed to talk just over the head of the common man. With his infatuation with the Ryder Cup and talking about people who are important to him, really have no impact on my life. All in all it is a very well written fast paced collection. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys political and social commentary. And to anyone who just like to read something different than a novel or text of history.Thanks For Your Time:T"
5,Happy Days Were Here Again: Reflections of a Libertarian Journalist,The book came in expected condition. They shipped quickly and did a great job.
2,MASTERING ADOBE PHOTOSHOP ELEMENTS ON CD (WRONG FORMAT),"I was shipped this guide on CD to use Elements 4.0 on my MAC and when I received it, It would NOT work on my Macbook Pro laptop and i find out it would ONLY work with Windows PC's NO WHERE IN THIS SELLERS DESCRIPTION DOES IT SAY IT WILL ONLY WORK ON PC'S!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I AM VERY DISPLEASED TO RECEIVE a product that I have NO USE AT ALL FOR!!!!C. Hendrix, Atlanta, GA"
5,Bring Ginnie back,"Bring Ginnie back to print! These books painted a colorful picture of Ginnie's adventures. Catherine Wooley does a great job of describing Ginnie's surroundings in great detail. She makes you feel like you are there. You can smell the food, feel the cold winter air, etc. It's really ashame they are out of print."
4,Ginnie and Geneva,Giftee was very pleased with book. Was as described. Thanks for the prompt service.
5,Craziest movie EVER!,"You have to see this movie. I have never seen a crazier movie. It has gansters who don't age, wacky songs (inlcuding Prince song's from the original Batman), pirates, I could go on and on. It is so hilarious, without meaning to be of course."
4,worth watching,"This movie is funny, yet sometimes its sad like most hindi films.What makes this movie worth watching though is the fact that shahrukh khan is playing a role that he never plays. And i think all his fans will enjoy this different style of his acting."
3,Image quality is sub standard,"The movie itself was fine, and if you're a fan of the stars in question, you'll want to check it out at some point.Just be aware that this 162 minute movie and probably another hour of features is crammed onto a single-layer DVD-R. As such they had to compress the heck out of it, hence loss of quality. Not so noticeable on a standard-def 31"" or smaller TV, but upscale to a big screen or HDTV, and it will bother you as it did me, and be a distraction from the performances, choreography, and cinematography. The worst parts of course are when there is a lot of motion on screen. So dance and action sequences are reduced to a pixellated mess. Well, you have to use your imagination for something, I guess.Hopefully this will become available on more appropriate media."
2,Must be a matter of taste,My daughter and I are very much into Bollywood yet this one didnt hit the spot for us as it did another reviewer. Yes I have seen West Side story!We actually found it a bit boring and not SRKs or Aishwaryas greatest roles. Rather low key and the dances didnt really grab us either.The focus is on the tit-for-tat thuggery between 2 delinquent gangs (one headed by SRK who did a Fonzie impersonation but without his usual ability to bring something else out of the character)
4,From one who has the LP phono records.,"I'm interested in getting the CD version of the Bayanihan LPs. Presumably the CD version collection were culled from master tapes or records, and thus are scratch free, because the LPs I have are worn out and noisy from countless playings. The music and songs are typically Filipino and I would really enjoy enormously if the CD version is clean and pristine as the day it was originally recorded. I presume not all the Bayanihan recordings can be contained in one CD, and more of those will be issued in the future. Thank you very much for allowing me to express my gratitude."
1,"DEFECTIVE, DISSAPOINTING PRODUCT","The thought of having a so called quality ""Hansgrohe"" product that is defective after less than a month is truly a surprising and irritating experience. I would recommend to steer away clear off this product. It looks good, Yes, but far from being durable. Paying almost $40 for something that does not even last more than a month is a complete dissappointment - I feel cheated. The rubber end hose connecting to the handshower broke or was peeled off. It appeared the glue/adhesive wore off. By any means, this product should have not pass the QA at Hansgrohe. I'm quite surprised that manufacturer released this defective product to the market. QUITE SHAMEFUL!"
4,Does the job,This hose fits the shower head perfectly and solved the leaking problem I was having with the old one. The only drawback is that it is pretty stiff and doesn't lie flat against the shower wall. It sticks out because it is not flexible and gets in the way when using the shower. I had hoped that it was just because it was new and that it would get more flexible with use but it has been almost two months and it has not relaxed yet.
3,Seemed rather expensive for the quality,"I purchased the Hansgrohe hose, shower arm mount, and E150 Raindance shower sprayer. The mount and sprayer were both well made and definitely worth the money. The hose, however, seemed overpriced given that it is just a plastic hose with metalized paint over the top. I recommend a flexible metal hose, such as those offered by Whedon or Grohe."
2,Did not fit my needs,"Originally, my bathroom did not have a hand shower. The shower head was sticking out above my head on an angled chrome pipe. I used an adapter to hook up this hose and a hand shower - a very common arrangement. In this arrangement, both ends of the hose are close together above one's head, and the hose makes a loop that hangs along the bathroom wall. I prefer the loop of the hose to be flexible enough to hang freely and and not to curve inside the bathtub.This is not the case with this hose. It curves into the bathtub a little, and when I take a shower, I can sometimes touch it. I do not like touching the hose. I bought Whedon ""Metal-Stretch Shower Hose"" instead - and I am happy with it so far."
5,roach motels,I used these roach along with a bait and haven't seen or caught any roaches recently. It's a good product.
2,DO NOT BUY,"so this just arrived in my mailbox today and after it being suggested from several different sources i had high expectations. however within the first 10 minutes i realized that i was going to be let down. i don't know how anyone could walk away after seeing this and possibly call it good. first the story is slow, boring, and half the time doesn't make sense. the story isn't the biggest problem though, it's the animation itself. it's true that there are a few beautiful scenes in this film but most of the time you'll be staring at obscure frames with someone talking in a reflection, sideways, or behind something. seriously, this entire film is like the last 2 episodes of evangelion. i would strongly say pass on buying this.just to be clear, i watch alot of anime (some of my favorites are ergo proxy, lain, battle angel, lucky star, and dokuru-chan) and while this isn't the worst, it's near the bottom of the list."
4,Dance beat but Okay,"I bought this CD on a lark. This one grew on me. It is an Industrial CD but there is enough solid musicianship to make it relistenable for me. A little heavy on that High Hat at times, but still a great spin!"
4,Help for the journey,Reading this book is one of the best ways that I can imagine to start or fine tune a partnership. Its concise and well written yet comprehensively covers the issues partners need to address before they become problems. The examples and anecdotes are incisive and reflect practical experience in fixing the disasters Dr. Gage would like us to avoid. Follow the directions in this book and avoid the bad accidents.
5,"A cornerstone book for anyone who is in a business partnership, or anyone wishing to assist in creating a healthy partnership","This cornerstone book is a must for anyone wishing to form a partnership, anyone who is already in a partnership, and anyone who is in the field of partnership development.I found the book to be very well structured, clear on the issues and very rich in examples. No doubt, David Gage is a pioneer in the field of partnership development and his rich experience working with partners & partnerships is felt all along the book. The book is written in such a way that it can be used as a reference-work book or a reading book that will enrich you on partners and partnerships and all the interesting stuff that is going on between people in partnerships.I deeply recommend this book, which I found to be one of a kind."
4,Good book that will sit on my desk,"I have skimmed this book and it looks great. However, it will probably sit on my bookshelf until I get desperate."
4,"GREAT Info, but the examples...killing me","There is a lot of good info in the book but the author goes overboard with examples and stories. I got it. You're a published author. The fact that I paid for the book means I designate you an authority in the subject matter. Quit trying to win me over with the stories.Everything else was really cool. Good outline. Good brief examples from time to time, in between the long forms.If you get into it, its about a 6-hour read and you'll feel compelled to make a move in your current partnership or think heavily on the correct steps to take before you enter one. I wouldn't say this is a must read, but its close for anyone starting a business and thinking about taking on a partner."
5,"""Required reading"" for designers, typographers, and students","""Required reading"" for designers, typographers, and students involved in Graphic Design today. One of the more incisive and effective books at covering the subject of contemporary typographic visual communication. You may not agree with it, but you'd better know about it."
4,Counterbalance to Pandora's box,"It is my view that folktales - tales of such quality that people kept the story alive for centuries - are excellent literature for people of any age. Anne Cameron aims her retellings of Northwest Native tales at a young audience but all of us can enjoy all of them.In this tale, Spider Woman saves the earth from the birds of torment - Spider Woman uses a spider web and a tall tree to hold the earth in place - and to put most birds of torment into their proper place on the other side of the sky blanket.An aside - one bird of tormet not expelled is tooth-ache, the subject of the oldest known written tale (from Mesopatamea)."
4,Great starting point for those curious about nofx,"I'm a fan of slightly easier newschool punk than this, but you really can't go past this record for fast, melodic, catchy, often hilarious punk rock. This one is for all the blink 182, new found glory pop-punk lovers who want to start getting into some original punk. It's far more accessible than any of nofx's earlier albums whilst still containing their typical sound and lyrics and is a better starting point than the war on errorism because they dont shove politics down your throat. So if ur 15-20 and are wondering which nofx album to pick up first, i have just answered ur question. Then pick up punk in drublic next. If you don't like either of those two, don't bother with any other nofx albums."
3,Not bad - not good!,"This CD isn't bad, it's decent punk rock with sometimes funny lyrics. The reason it doesn't deserve more than 3 stars is, that there is nothing new! They could have released this album 5 years ago and nobody would have noticed a difference. I believe that a band always has to improve and sometimes change their style a bit - like they did with 'the Decline' which I believe is one of the best punk rock songs ever written, but this is just the old NOFX style that gets boring after a while."
4,smashingggggggggggggg,"WOW! this album is fan-bleeding-tastic. this is my 1st NOFX album so maybe i'm not the best judge, but how ACE are this band! 'whats the matter wiv parents today' is classic. a complete sing-a-long happy tune, the whole first half of the album rocks, wiv amazing beats, like, 'take two placebos...', 'clams have feelings' , 'thank god its monday' so that when u think things couldn't get any better, u hear 'total bummer' the best song on the album! it blew me anyway, with the hilarious lyrics 'go away , sunny day..etc' and is a sample of the greatness of the album and of what NOFX can really do! keep punking!"
2,"Well, it's better than Wolves In Wolves' Clothing...","Which is by far their WORST cd. You want to know an essential NOFX cd? The Decline. Okay, as for this CD, has one or two good songs, and the rest is just white noise. Don't buy the newer stuff either, it's terrible. Stick with the oldies."
2,BORING!!!!,I have some older NOFX material and I like it but they are now starting to push the limits of repetiveness. Every new nofx song sounds the same and is pretty boring. You can just imagine what their future releases are gonna sound like. The music is all technically good and this album would be good if it were their first but everyones seen it all before. They have lost their status as 'punk-rock' and now fit 'pop-punk'. They're on the radio aswell and I am sure I'll see them on MTV with a expensive vid. If you haven't got any old stuff from nofx then you should get this as it as their sound is pretty unique but if you have then don't buy it.
1,GIVE IT UP!,"Terrible. If you are looking for a depressant, look no further. This is, without a doubt, the worst NOFX album ever. It seems like they went out of their way to make the album awful. I think I'll use this CD as a coaster."
2,"is it just me, or did this band get really stupid?","I don't know about you, but when i bought punk in drublic 7 years ago I was expecting great things out of this band. somewhere along the way, however, the band seemed to become a parody of something. There were always stupid moments on NOFX albums and stupid moments certainly can give some charm to an album, but you really have got to be careful when the stupidity becomes infectious and ruins all your songs. Song like ""lineoleum"" and ""reeko"" seemed to have some sort of point. Songs like ""my vagina"" ""clams have feelings too"" and ""dinosaurs will die"" would be cool if they had never been recorded. it's one of those jokes where you say ""ok, let's record a song called my vagina"" and then everyone laughs. that would be funny. what's not funny is actually recording it. it's simply dumb. this NOFX album is completely retarded. don't buy it."
4,Not Nofx's best but still good,"If you are into hardcore, humourous punk this is a band and album for you. Fat Mike is still joking about women and dope, and writing the occasional punk song, but he's got my respect for not selling out like the rest of 'them'. Nofx has slowed down a little but not to a bad degree, and Jason Josephes, a great punk fan I might add, needs to start reviewing some other genre like pop and Britney spears. A great Cd, buy it you won't be sorry."
3,Punk rock on a metal edge,"Except for the occasional jazz or reggae interlude, the rest of the disc, with its heavily compressed guitars and intensely precise drumming, buzzes by innocuously. At least Fat Mike adn the boys seem to know the score: the title of the disc's opening track is ""And Now Something Completely Similar."""
5,best cd since punk in drublic!,This is the best nofx cd in my opinion. every song is good and i would totally reccomend it
3,IDPA REVIEW,"Produced in 1997 early IDPA was just getting started. I recognize some of the names still active shooters. The production was good but did lack a little. I'm sure it is expensive to produce anything.As the name suggest it is IDPA only with rules and structure of the organization.It points out the differences in IDPA and other organizations who have gotten away from the basics. IDPA teaches basics in gun shooting, carry & concealment with the average person in mind who is just interested in personal self defense using the least equipment,nothing fancy.What it does not teach is shooting techniques, stance, concealment, cover, grip, trigger control or drawing. There are other great teachers for that, try Personal Defense TV, or Shooting USA DVD's.Aimhigh& Keep your power dry."
3,LOTS OF LOVE,I have the tape to this item but I like the CD better... I have never bought a used item but this is great....
5,BEST GROUP NOT TO HIT IT BIG.,"AS FAR AS MALE/FEMALE GROUPS GO,THEY R DA BEST.BUY THIS DISC AND U WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED."
3,Not the grandest of a grand series,"I love Wallace and Gromit and anything by Nick Parks, but A Grand Day Out is my least favorite in the series. If you've never seen a Wallace and Gromit film, I suggest starting with The Wrong Trousers or A Close Shave, both of which are side-splittingly funny and clever, and then moving on to Chicken Run. Grand Day is more atypically subdued and subtle, but it is still good. I could go for some cheese right now, but unlike Wallace, I like mine with fruit."
2,a disjointed effort,"There is almost too much going on in the story. Grass' creativity is astounding, with the she-rat and the space ship, but portions of the plot with Grimm fairytale characters are somewhat annoying. Oskar turns up, along with others. It's difficult to imagine someone staying with this book long enough to meet him if they hadn't already read Tin Drum. Here, Grass has taken the post-modernist position of the teller and chats away. The books in which he shined weren't chatty at all. The sections of the ""plot"" don't meld together as they do in, say, the Flounder. Some books bring tears when finished. One simply doesn't want it to end. I managed to finish the Rat, but just put it back on the shelf. It was nice to see Oskar and his grandmother, though, with all those skirts..."
4,World Lit Class,"I had to read this book in a world lit class for school and I am not someone who reads often or for leisure but I found this book to be very good and liked they way it was translated by Herbert Mason. The first day that we were assigned to read it we were only supposed to read the first half, but I enjoyed the book so much that I read the whole thing the first day, even though its not very long that's still saying something because I don't enjoy reading. I think he does a good job of writing in a way that provides you with a clear image of his depiction of the epic of Gilgamesh. I would recommend this book to anyone that has an interest in epic novels because this one is short, interesting, and provides good imagery and you get a good sense of how gilgamesh and enkidu are feeling and what they experience along the way."
4,A wonderful edition with beautiful writing,"I love how relevant the themes of Gilgamesh remain to today's world. I love seeing the obvious influence this story had on the Bible and other ancient works (but not as ancient as Gilgamesh). I love the gorgeous lines like ""You will be left alone, unable to understand in a world where nothing lives anymore as you thought it did"" (Enkidu telling Gilgamesh what will happen upon his death) and ""The only nourishment he knew was grief, endless in its hidden source yet never ending hunger."" Worth rereading again and again for its beautiful simplicity."
5,good version,This is probably one of the best versions I've come across. It tells it like a story and is very readable (unlike many others).
4,A new way of thinking about Gilgamesh..,"When I read the long list of books in the syllabus for my Honors World Lit class, I was pleasantly surprised to see ""Gilgamesh"" on there. I had read a different translation in high school, and I was expecting pretty much the same thing. However, I found that Mason goes into much more detail and focuses mainly on the hero of the story, Gilgamesh: his transformation into a more mortal man, his struggle with his own humanity, what inspired him to begin his journey, and the beauty of his coping mechanisms as he learns and realizes the difficulties of love and friendship. Mason's version of Gilgamesh is ultimately a story of the journey of realizing, accepting, and growing in one's humanity. It is a timeless tale of both the difficulties and the beauty of the human condition. I recommend this book, but give the warning to do your best not to read too literally and just take things at face value, but attempt to understand the meaning behind the words. Happy reading!"
4,Gilgamesh,"I had to read this book for a school World History class. This tale of the ancient god Gilgamesh, was written in free-form verses. This book was short, with an intresting and thought-provocking introduction and conclusion. I have not read other translations, but this one semmed very benificial to the high-school aged student. Although I did not really enjoy the story, it really forced you to think; about life, death, and immortality. Also included was a great feature, a glossey at the back of the book so you could look up proper nouns when you got confused. I found the glossery so helpful as I read this book. In conclusion, although this book was not my peferred style of writing, this is a very good translation of an epic tale."
5,Stellar Tribute,"Great CD, just what we wanted. Great service from this company. Thanks!!! Recieved in a timely manner and in great shape and great price.Sharon Clemmer"
1,disappointed,I didn't know this is an all instrumental cd. it is good. but i would not have bought it knowing it was all instrumental.
4,Must have for Dwight Fans,"This album is good stuff. Just Dwight and his guitar. This album rocks even without Pete Anderson playing. This format conveys even more emotion than the original versions (See: ""Johnson's Love""). Not all of the songs are better, but they sure are different. If you love Dwight (as any self-respecting music fan should) you should own this. If you like Country Music you should own this. If you like real Rock-n-Roll (I'm not talking about Third Eye Blind here, either) you should own this."
5,On Constant Play,"This is an album I never get tired of. I play it when I cook. I play it when I drive my kids to school. I play it when I'm painting. It has become a soundtrack for my life. I play it when friends come over and they always say, ""Who is this? I love it.""This album is a gem. Stripped down and raw, its true emotion is refreshing. This is in my top 3 of all time great albums, and I think I'll still be listening to it when I'm 70 years old . . good stuff!"
5,Another winner,"When I hear that an artist is doing an acoustic album, the first thing that enters my mind, is that the artist ran out of ideas......not the case with Dwight. If you want to know if an artist has actually ""got it"", put him in a room with only a flat-top guitar, and tell him to sing. Despite any of his rockabilly influences, the true Dwight will never lose his roots of the Kentucky hills; and what better way to demonstrate that than with a little acoustic music. Actually, there's nothing little about this album; it's a full length CD that any other artist would've made into a two CD set (and charged twice the money!). I wont bore with you the details of the songs included here, as they're listed on the album cover. However, besides the bluegrass flavored numbers which you'd expect to be acoustic, there are quite a few songs included here that one would not expect to be acoustic.....and, of course, Dwight delivers them with perfection. A+"
5,No words are apt enough to describe this cd.,"After watching ""Walk The Line,"" I became very interested and passionate about country music and I was led,(thankyou God), to the music of Mr.Yoakam.This CD is blissfully heartbreaking in the true Irish sense of the word.I love the sincerity in his sad, sad beautiful voice. Do yourself a favor and buy a couple. One for you and the friend who will want to borrow it.A note to Mr. Yoakam:Please listen to ""The Furey Brothers and Davey Arthur."" I think you will like them."
5,This is real talent here!!,I am not even a country fan and I really enjoy this album. I've seen quite a few artists perform songs acoustic in concert and it is always moving and intamate. When an artist can do it stripped down with just a guitar like this you know they have real talent and that their heart is in the music.Listening to this make me feel like I'm at a barbeque with Dwight and he's just hanging out strummin his guitar. Raw talent. BUY THIS ALBUM!!!
5,"oh my, oh my, oh my","I remember seeing Dwight at The Palace in Hollywood back in the 80's and thinking it doesn't get any better than this...it does. With just Dwight and his guitar, his pure, sweet voice fills the room. It's like having your own private performance. Turn it up and enjoy!"
5,REAL country,"Absolutely stunning! All of the songs sound much better in this stripped down format. It brings the songwriting to the forefront, and makes a strong argument for Yoakam as one of the premiere songwriters of the last 20 years. The recording is specatacular, totally intimate... this is what Jimmie Rodgers would have sounded like had he lived in the 1990's. You can appreciate his nuanced phrasing and deft guitar work. This is also a great introduction to Dwight, as no one will be alienated by the production... it's just the musician and the listener, and of course two dozen mind-boggling songs. Sure, we can criticize Dwight for putting out another ""rehash"" and buying time until his next ""real"" album, but when it sounds this good, who's complaining?"
1,"Warmed over Dwight is still ""warmed over"".","Am I missin' something or isn't this the second Dwight Yoakam ""greatest hits"" in a row? I didn't buy the first one and I'm not gonna buy this one. I don't care if Yoakam is too busy to come up with new material, he shouldn't expect his fans to support his second-rate acting career by purchasing yesterday's papers. C'mon, Dwight, give us some new stuff."
1,Great guitar!,"I purchased this album based on reviews. I must be an outsider because I found this entire CD annoying. Eliminate the vocals and the instrumentals would be far more pleasing. Even the poingnant ""1000 Miles From Nowhere"" is brought down in this album. What a shame."
2,Wish I hadn't bought it!,"I bought the previous 2 versions of Spysweeper with no problems, but this thing is a headache. When it comes on suddenly (there is no warning), it completely drains the computer (and mine has a huge amount of memory), everything fades, and whatever you are doing gets locked up. It will not shut off, either, when ""stop scan"" is clicked. To do a full sweep it takes several hours, over 6 and still sweeping, and in the meantime the computer is locked up, and you can't do anything else. Either the computer crashes if other programs are open, or they sit there faded and locked up. The only way to stop it is to shut off the computer. I finally had to shut off the full sweep setting and just use the quick sweep which is an option."
1,This is not up to the standard set by Mothers & Daughters,I bought this book by mistake thinking it was done by the authors of Sisters. I was greatly disappointed until I realized that their book was called Mothers & Daughters which I think is definitely superior.
5,oh my god--it worked wonders. just heavenly,"oh, i lost 20 in 3 months! Can you believe it? I look great, feel great and lots of lucious men appreciate it. What a fabulous book--buy, buy buy, a must have for all americans!"
5,Love it,Worked well. My kids bike did not have one so i had to find one that fit. Works graet!! Thanks
5,Easy to install and works great...,"This is easy to recommend, as it was so easy to install and works every time. I installed it on my mountain bike and it works in any terrain, along with the kickstand cover on the end."
2,Xymox Gets Trendy,"This is certainly a departure for gothic rock band Xymox, formerly Clan of Xymox. The band trades in their usual gothic sound for something a lot more commercial and trendy. Released in the early 1990's, the album reflects the dance music popular in clubs and on MTV at the time. I almost expect Downtown Julie Brown from Club MTV to come barging in. I enjoy that kind of music but Xymox comes off sounding like the second-rate dance artists of that time. There is not a single memorable song on the album. None of the songs are really that bad. They just don't stand out. For that I give them 3 stars and took away a star for trying to cash in on the trend of that time."
3,three and a half stars,"Are you kidding me , this is such a hard to fine item, some of the song itself does'nt exist anywhere except on this album. I've had this album on tape when it first came out, yes i said TAPE,accidentaly broke it, been missing it ever sence, until now, gret fine. Now that i'm older, (I think this album came out in the 80's)it does'nt seem to sound as good, but it is still a great fine, if you are into goth music or just somthing different."
2,It would be 5 stars if it had had the pictures,I realize that and e-read may not be able to have pictures but in this case it would be helpful to have known that there are no pictures of the beautiful castles.
4,Good Movie!,This was a good movie for the Holiday Season. My family enjoyed it too. We liked the plot of the movie.
5,Real Good !!!,"It Was Good , how the story was wrote, if anything or someone stole something, I Think It is very good To Return it, if possible !! i would buy again if need too !!"
4,Been a long time,"If my mother had had a squeeze box, this entire album would have been playing 24/7. Listening to it again brings back great memories. It's a gift she'll love as the music is so heartfelt and spiritual. Kim Hill does not compromise with this album."
3,Testimony - Kim Hil,Received with no problem. Love Kim Hill but this is not one of my favorites.Jackie
2,Disappointed,"While the photo album is adorable - there is much confusion about how many you are actually ordering and what color. Although it states 2 Each, you only receive one per order and you cannot specify the color (pink or blue) -- so good luck in getting the right one."
2,"I love ""Password""... just not this version.","Over the years, I have managed to amass a collection of pretty much every version of ""Password"" ever produced. With the exception of ""Super Password,"" I enjoyed every televised version of the show. The ""Password"" episode of ""The Odd Couple"" is one of my all time TV favorites. You may have guessed, I like the game.This DVD version is, for all intent and purpose, just an over-produced variation on the standard home version. Instead of the cards and holders, you get a pair of 3-D looking glasses. Unfortunately, you can easily read the secret password on the screen without the glasses. And, the computer generated host (Charmin' Chuck Harmin) is just about as annoying a host as they could come up with.Endless Games has produced many good home games. DVD games, at least going by this one, do not fit into their business model quite as well. Save yourself some money and get their standard edition ""Password"" game. It's not as high-tech. But it's a lot more fun."
3,Its OK...,"Well, this was a gift for somebody who really wanted to get Password as a game. So I bought this and we all played it. Its not too bad, but could be better. The ""3-D"" way of hiding the word is a joke. It tells you to adjust the screen's picture so nobody else can read the secret word. But who wants to mess up their tv just for that, and it really doesn't help. The concept is still fun, we had a blast...but there's gotta be a better way. Too much packaging and a bit pricy for what we actually got."
3,I eat this every morning for the last 10 yrs,"Milk Chocolate Peanut. My only favorite. I've been eating the same kind of slim fast bar every day for the last 10 yrs. Not just because of weight problems, it's healthy and convenient as well.The reason I gave 3 stars is because of how the product arrived. I thought finally I found an easy convenient and cheap way to get my every day breakfast... Well, I received my slim fast which was probably exposed to heat for a long time because it looks BAAAD! It looks really bad and when I open it all the chocolate pieces are falling all around my desk. It's gross.I don't know if I am gonna give another chance for them. I don't know if I just received a ""defective"" package this one time. I'll think about it."
3,Great collection/translation but bad print quality.,"The translation and collection is admirable, but the quality of this Signet paperback I received is very cheap looking. For some reason it just seems crammed and most pages seem like they are typed in bold and others normal. Sometimes there will be a diagonal bolding of a page (like a line of bold going through from top left to bottom right) to the point where an ""a"" will have the entire bottom filled in. Not sure if I got a bad copy, but this isn't something I've ever noticed in a book before. This also makes some of the footnotes hard to read because they are even smaller so a ""w"" is all filled in and looks like an upside down triangle with the tip cut off."
2,Ick,"Beautiful translation, the timeless texts of Plato -but delivered in tiny print without many notes. Great texts, lousy edition."
4,Great translation and annotations,"There is little to say about this publication that has already been stated. However, I would like to point out that the inclusion of 'Ion' is a bit baffling. I would not classify it a 'great' dialogue in the vein of even other early works by Plato, e.g. the 'Protagoras', 'Phaedrus' or 'Euthyphro', and certainly does not match up to the 'Timaeus', 'Parmenides', or 'Theaetetus', all of which could have just as well earned a place in this compilation. Its inclusion is perhaps justifiable to provide new readers with a quick 'introductory' dialogue to acquaint themselves with the Socratic process, but one would ask why the publishers would try to grab readers this way: shouldn't the dialogues speak for themselves?Regardless, the translation and annotation is excellent for the beginning and intermediate reader of Plato, and Signet books are typically of high material quality to begin with, so this may be the best paperback Plato on the market."
2,No page numbers,"I got this edition for a Introductory Government course at college. While it was the edition my professor required, there are no page numbers that go along with this book. No page numbers means that this edition is impossible to cite properly! If this edition were to have page numbers, it would be perfect but the location numbers make no sense when everyone else in the class is using a physical copy."
5,Great book for people interested in the art of philosophy.,"This book is perfect for those who are interested in philosophy. From the ideal city-state, education, to the mention of the immortality of the soul, this argumentative masterpiece forces the reader to think to new levels!"
4,"Great""can't put it down"" read","If you are looking for a book that grabs you and pulls you in, then this is it. I have always enjoyed Ms. Smith's endevors and I was not disappointed with this one. The finely drawn characters and smart pace made this book a hard one to put down. I stayed up until the wee hours of the morning just to finish it( the last time I did that was years ago.) I really cared about the players and I cared about the ending. Only one thing, I wish that the middle was a little longer."
4,Much better than expected,"The book started out a bit slow but gave you some solid time to build up the characters. When I was reading the background, I kept thinking that I wanted to quit the book. But half way through, the action started. Then it was non-stop. And by that time you really started getting emotionally vested in the characters due to sheer time getting to know them. So if you can take a slow start, the ending is more than worth the effort. And it is an absolutely fantastic ending too. I'm glad I stuck in there during the slow parts in the beginning. So in short, I would recommend this book to other readers (especially to those that like a lot of background and character developments in their stories)."
4,Good story line....,This book held my interest from the beginning. I enjoyed the story and felt this was well written. Would recommend it.
4,An Easy Read,I liked this book. It was somewhat predictable but was a very enjoyable read! I will check out other books by this author.
2,Disappointing,"After reading - and thoroughly enjoying - several books by Deborah Smith (most notably ""A Place to Call Home""), I would tell anyone interested in this ofering from Ms. Smith not to bother. In fact, had this been the first book I had ever read by her, I would have struck her off my ""Authors to look for"" list entirely. The book is predictable, banal and I struggled to get through to the last page. And that's not mentioning the lapses in time-sequence, the jumbled and flawed heirarchy of characters, and the typos that are part of this frustrating story to boot.Bottom line - if you're looking for a good read, don't go looking in The Stone Flower Garden."
3,Lengthy but interesting.,"Although the contrived plot was a bit implausible and the awaited climax drawn out to the point that the reader is cognizant of what it will be long before its arrival, still the portrayal of characters and the story line were interesting."
2,Blah,"I read this because it was a free Kindle book, but I wouldn't bother again. It was rather like a souped-up Harlequin romance. Very predictable and badly in need of an editor. Grammar, spelling and punctuation errors all over the place. However, the story was somewhat interesting so I give it two stars."
3,Light Entertainment,Even though this book was light entertainment the story had a good flow to it and the characters were entertaining.
4,Stone Flower Garden,Great story of childhood friendship that carries through to adulthood. Shared secrets can shape lives in more ways than just friendship>
4,Awesome story,"Has everything from family loyalty, romance, a little racism & murder. Couldn't but the book down. Author wrote a good story."
2,not really what i expected,"If your looking for a pin-ball kind of game you might be dissapointed. Really all this is a mario game. Even die hard mario fans (like my brother) will be dissapointed. All you do is go into doors and kill enimeis then go into more doors, it gets boring after awhile. Another thing, you can only have ONE save which means if you have siblings and they wanna play you'll have to share a file. this game also gets old VERY fast too!Some + sides are:good musicsound effects from many of the mario gamesgoomba's!All in all i wouldn't really buy this game i'd personaly just rent it or even download it.there's some good emulator sites out there."
3,my last review for this game.,I just beated this game! Bowser auctually gets easy once you get the hang of this. His first form is annoying. but his second is fun and easy. You just have break everything in the room including the wheels. Then hit bowser into the holes 3 times or 4 (holes that were cerated by hitting bowser into the wheels). the most annoying is ancient koopa. Verson two is worse. There's not much of a ending. I put a high score in the game. and high time trials in the game. this game is okay.
1,THE worst Mario game ever made,"This has to be the worst Mario game ever made, even the Mario Party Games and Super Mario Bros. 2 are better. The graphics and sound stink. The pinball based gameplay ruins anything that could possibly be Mario about the game. In one word: horrible. I rate this game 13/100."
2,The controls aren't tight enough.,"For the upside, it's one of the better handheld pinball games out there. It ain't bad... but the controls could be A LOT better. If you've played Metroid Prime Pinball, and then tried to go back to this one, you're going to be sadly disappointed. Using the flippers and attempting to move Mario to certain places on the screen can be irritating. This is truly one of those games I'd rather just cheat on from the beginning instead of being frustrated with the wobbly controls in trying to do what I need to do.Not particularly recommended unless you just love Mario or pinball games in general."
3,Review,Here's my review.Music: Big boo and petey have some of the best mario pinball land music to date. the rest are average.Garaphics: This is as strong as advance can get.contrulls: Really annoynig.pinball: not as new as pokemon pinball 2 and kirby pinball when they were finished. This game borrows off a pinball game from NES and I hope metroid pinball will be better and newer with it's rumble device.Shacking: missing in this game. in most piball games.Overal: okay for a pinball game. Don't buy unless your into evey mario game.
1,Don't Buy This Game,This game is not a good game at all. First of all there is a horilble storyline. The ball is hard to manuver and fall out quickly. And finally when you turn it off it automatically deletes the file. I know its in the instrution book but it happens on inctinct. Trust me I am a game lover and this is just disappionting. I like mario games and I love pinball but this game is baadd. Trust me buy something good. I would buy Kingdom Hearts: Chain Memories.
2,fun is short-lived,"Mario shows up once again, this time in his own pinball game. I'm sure this one will sell a ton of copies. Truth be told, Mario Pinball Land is like some cheap bubble gum that loses flavor after a couple of minutes.Sure, the graphics are detailed and colorful, and all the gang of characters is here. The pinball action is simple yet works pretty well. So what is the problem? Very repetitive. The screens vary with different locales (pyramids, caves, deserts, etc) but the action never changes. I found myself getting bored with it early on. This one is for the kids."
3,Not Worth Your Money,Overall Mario Pinball Land is a boring game that lacks depth. The graphics and the whole idea of making a pinball game with mario in in are the only two postive features. The gameplay gets boring after the first coupple of minutes because all you have to do is hit mario in the into alll the bad guys that are walking around the feild.Pros*Graphics are box art are pretty good*The sound is what you would expect from apinball game*Items make the gameplay a little intrestingCons*Boring plot*Gameplay lacks depth*Not worth more than $10OverallThe game is not worth your money unlees you spend $10 or less on it. After about 5 plays of the game you will find you will not play it much more.
5,satisfied,"I am a very large person with knee problems, I purchased this item for it's size which I am very satisfied with overall. The straps are not long enough but that is not a problem in my case because I can work with that. As one person said before it does not have a stiff support but for me it will serve the purpose of just tightening up my bad area giving me some type of support where I have none now. I am satisfied with my purchase although I plan to make adjustments."
1,disappointed,I was not happy with the fit of this brace. I was in need of support and comfort due to a torn muniscus. Surgery did the job but this brace did not help at all.
4,"Great overall, but","This product is great overall. Comfortable (at least as far as a brace can be). Only catch is that I was right on the cusp on the measurements, so I ordered up. I really wish I had ordered the smaller size, I sometimes have issue with this one slowly sliding down. As I prefer to wear it under clothing, This can be quite an issue with walking through the grocery store. Just imagine a three year old pointing at you and stating in what can only be described as a loud voice, ""Momma your knee is falling off!"" So I would suggest going toward the smaller side if you have any doubt as I am also sure it will loosen a bit with time and I have only had this one a week."
1,NO SUPPORT!!!!,The package arrived faster than expected which was great. There is no medial or lateral support in the brace at all and I have had it on for 10 minutes and it is already slipping. I am not impressed with his product at all but was happy with the shipping.
2,horrible fit,"Bought this for my large, football-playing son. Looks like a great product, but we don't know because he can't wear it. Big on top, but doesn't taper below the knee so it doesn't stay on. Not too many people have the same size thigh and calf!"
3,It serves its purpose.,"It's ok, not great. By the time you get it on properly it's more of a knee immobilizer not stabilizer."
2,Too large,"I used the size guide from the seller, but the wrap is too large - it slides down. (I'm not sure if this is a size issue or a design issue.) But in order to exchange it for another size, I have to pay to ship it to them and they will charge to ship another to me. Since I can't be sure that the smaller size will work I didn't want to invest another $14 to make an exchange."
1,Don't Buy!!!!,"This product is a waste of money, is poorly made, and the customer service from the buyer is awful. I've rarely encountered such nasty customer service reps as I did with this buyer. Additionally, the product is not manufactured well, is difficult to use, and overall does not stablize the knee. A one star rating equates to ""I hate it"", which sums it up nicely. However, I wish I could rate this product with less than one star to also account for the seller's poor service!"
3,Hard to assemble,"The extension is nice, but it was hard to add. You have to twist the gate in a wierd way and the knobs were hard to twist. The extra space is nice."
4,Great play pin,"We got these because we wanted to make a huge, safe play are for my son. It has worked great. My only complaint is that it is incredibly difficult to attach it to the existing gate and the whole think is a little flimsy, but we found that putting it over a rug really helped to anchor it. I wouldn't put it on top of a hard flat surface because it would move around I think."
3,It will work,"It is the correct panels, however they ar very hard to open and close unlike the rest of the gate. Don;t know if it is because its an extension or just these particular panels?"
4,"Works well, hard to assemble","I bought these to enlarge my secure surround play yard. It works wonderfully and greatly increases the size of the play area. However, it is a royal pain to add the panels in. It was worth the trouble."
3,Be prepared,"Adding these two pieces to the original six makes the sides very wobbly so, if your child is pulling up to stand, the sides will sway back and forth. I am lucky enough to have a space where I can support the sides with furniture so they are sturdier, so I love the extra space these two pieces give to the actual play area. Just be prepared to support the sides."
2,Summer Infant Play Yard,"Somewhat flimsy material, hard to insert in main play yard. Play yard can be tipped easily if not secured. I bungee corded an old tv cart to provide stability."
1,Doesn't Fit,"I see how this gate is supposed to work. We purchased it work with the Summer Infant Secure Surround Playsafe Playard, and it is totally the wrong piece."
2,Disappointed in the weak play yard panels,"We were disappointed in these play yard panels. Compared to others we have, they were floppy and not secure when baby pulls himself up on them. We also noticed that the connectors where you latch one panel to another, are extremely difficult to hook together and not very sturdy. They absolutely stand well and if they were constructed a bit better, we would be very happy with them. We would not recommend these, but rather would recommend ones that are stronger."
4,Thank you to the person who explained you have to use a screwdriver!,"This is a great playard! BUT...no where does it explain if you had the 2 piece attachment and you are connecting it to the 6 piece that you must use a screwdriver to remove the gray knobs and reassemble them in the correct space. I also thought that ""twisting"" and ""pushing"" the gate was a bit difficult (I felt as if I was going to break it!) Thank you to the previous reviewer who explained that if you look underneath the gray knob you will see a small screw to remove it! I would never have figured that out if I hadn't been so frustrated I then came and looked at the reviews for help. Otherwise I'm thankful to be able to put my little crawler somewhere safe to answer the door or step away for 1 minute!"
1,THIS BOOK DESERVES ZERO STARS,"This book covers feminist debates on sex issues and it covers stories about prostitution and adult entertainment. It contains many interviews, but they are all bascially the same. The issues are all the same, the interviews are all the same and the debates are all the same. The erotic labor performed by the women mentioned in this book is nothing we all don't already know about, so this book is not telling us anything new or even interesting. I didn't get anything useful out of this book."
3,"Fine, but not as interesting as MY LIFE & LOVES","A so so read, that's all. All these books should be sold below $4.00/e"
1,Not for me,"I have read several Classic and Historical Fiction novels that referenced this book so I thought I should pick it up and see what it is all about. I understand now why it created such a stir when it was first published! If you think the 50 Shades series is racy you should stay away from Fanny Hill. I am a fan of romance novels as a nice escape from reality every now and then but, I found myself putting this book down after about 25% was read. I learned all I needed to know to understand the referances to it in other literature!"
2,Fanny Hill Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure,I did not care for this book. I didn't finish it. I found it boring and repetitive. Not my favorite.
2,Good story but poorly transcribed to Kindle edition,"I would recommend finding a version other than this one. I'm finding spelling mistakes, sentences that don't make sense, and a lot of other mistakes that just shouldn't be there. Don't buy this version."
5,"If you liked Bustin Out for GBA, You'll LOVE the Urbz","The Sims are back, with a new and edgy attitude and environment. No more farm for you, you wake up with a thankless job in the big city and it's your goal to make it big. You can choose from four ""groups"": Arties, Nerdies, Richies or Streeties, but you can be friends with all of the groups and complete all the group missions too.What's best about this game are the fun characters, original settings, and approachable missions. There are few new elements such as woodcarving and baking too. The ""jobs"" are really fun minipuzzles, and the Xixxles (perks such as lower hunger or more money for jobs) make the game more interesting, without having to use codes/cheating.This game is obviously restricted in that it's a GAMEBOY, not a gamecube or a computer, so the limitless possibilities of the Sims are not going to be here, but if you are goal oriented, like puzzles, and enjoyed Bustin Out, you will love this game!"
3,Just not quite the Sims...,"The Sims Bustin' Out on GBA was a fresh, new idea. But this is the exact same thing except for a different city, more people, and more objects. There is absoulutely NO open ended gameplay in this game. Don't buy this looking for the Sims..."
1,The Real Aspect Review,"I traded games with my best friend. I got the game and I spent quite literally hours trying not only stay alive but trying to complete the annoying task that are given.The graphics and controls are horrid. The time is very un-realistic. The time goes by way too fast (1 second=2 minutes). The mini-games get frustrating after a while. Also, every 1 to 2 days in a basic house you WILL get robbed. When you rent the larger house you have a lesser chance of getting robbed. It gets very annoying after a while. I would not even purchase this for a thousandth of a cent. I absolutely HATE IT!!!!"
1,NO,NO I HATE THIS GAME! All the sims games except for gameboy games have been great. i bought the sims bustin out on GBA and it was #%@$!!! i sold it to a used game seller! i had to do the same with this one. IF U WANT REAL SIMS BUT THE PC OR GAMECUBE OR PS2 GAMES NO GBA!!!!! HAS THIS HAPPENED TO U????????
5,SIMS,"I am greatly satisfied with this product. Although this was used it worked immensely well and ran smoothly. I detected nothing wrong with the game, it was a great purchase on my part."
4,Love the Urbs!!,"bought this for my daughter who remembered it from the past...she is enjoying it once again, glad I purchased it and at a great price!"
4,This is the Best ONe yet!,"I am so shocked that this game is so great! i was addicted, my parents couldn't even pry me away from it! I think that it was so much better!Pro's:More HOusesMore PetsMOre MinigamesMORE GOOD GRAPHICS!Cons:Long GOals (i had to buy the cheat book to finish it)Eats up timeI loved this game!!! great investment of hard earned money!!!!"
4,Will not be sorry,"After about three listens I cannot believe I completely missed Hammerhead and this album fifteen years ago. This is one fine album, incredibly well executed with some crazy catchy riffs and song structure."
2,Don't waste your money,"I agree with the other reviewer when they said there's not much info on this DVD. It doesn't even show how to fire the clay with a torch (which most people do), only a kiln. It shows beautiful jewelry on the cover which is very deceiving because the DVD doesn't include instructions on how to make these pieces!Complete waste of money."
2,Not very informative,I get almost as much info free from youtube or browsing free articles. I suppose it is great for someone that knows nothing yet. I was disappointed.
2,Less useful than I thought it would be.,Was told to buy this by advisor when starting grad school. Should have purchased the APA Manual instead. This book is confusing and often refers to the Manual.
5,All turned out fine!,"This book arrived later than I expected, but I must say that it arrived in excellent condition and I would order from this merchant again in the future. Thank you!"
2,"A Style Manual lacking, uh, Style","I have to admit, the book lost me on page one with the sickening ""According to Merriam-Websters Collegiate Dictionary, style is "" a convention with respect..."" blah blah. Is that the best of your collective efforts?So, with that grabber of an opener, the reader is treated to an oddly reverent discussion on APA style. As the other reviewers stated, it isn't a reference in any form. I suppose, if one were really, really committed to the APA style they could wade through this book and learn the in's and out's of the style. Outside of a class specifically on that topic, I can't imagine anyone spending the time to complete the lessons.So, I will purchase a reference book and learn an important lesson on reading the book description carefully."
1,Waste of time.,"I do not recommend this book unless you have no clue about APA. If, you are somewhat familiar with using APA style in your research papers, do not bother to purchase it. You can glean the same information from the actual 5th ed. of the APA manual. Check with your reference librarian at you college or university. They may be able to provide you with handouts that may actually be more useful. Therefore, I did not find this book user friendly."
3,Text book used for class,"Good reference as far as textbooks go. With the advent of sophisticated computer edits, this volume is not as practical. Also, all the styles referenced can be found on the internet. I would only use this volume if I did not have use of a computer or the internet."
3,"Mastering APA Style: Student's Workbook and Training Guide, Fifth Ed.","Companion to textbook, easy to use and thorough. Covers all areas if beginning to use APA style seriously for papers on undergraduate or graduate level."
2,Mastering APA Style: Students Workbook and Training Guide,"While this appears to be an excellent textbook, it was not a helpful resource to those looking for information on citing various references and sources. This book is strictly for those who are or will be writing papers meant for publication. However, if you are looking for a book with listings of how to cite your sources (i.e. a bibliography) you won't find that information here."
2,A Training Guide that isn't really a Guide at all,"Take careful note of what is written on page 10 before you even think of ordering this unhelpful guide:""Be sure you have a copy of the Publication Manual (5th edition) before you begin to use the workbook.""Mastering APA Style is just a compilation of several multiple-choice tests that are supposed to help with mastering this style of writing. There are no rules and there are no helpful tips on researching and writing publications; it is entirely a book of examples. And each example points to a specific rule detailed in the Publication Manual, a different guide entirely!Hopefully the Publication Manual succeeds at explaining what APA style really is, because this training guide doesn't. Unless you already know how to get around using APA, do not waste your money on this book."
4,Mastering APA Style,"This book was very helpful for me because it had actual exercises for me to evaluate and complete and the answers were on the opposite page. Because of the ring binder, it was easy to complete the exercise without being tempted to look over to the next page. But once I was done, opening the book with the pages both in view aided me with understanding when I was incorrect and why."
2,Great? Hardly,"Some people like this live Rach 3 performance from 1978, because it is so 'full of profound feeling'. For me, though, Horowitz exaggerates everything so much that it becomes almost unbearable. The deluge of wrong notes, a piano that sounds like nail-scratching-blackboard, much unnecessary banging and an uninspired support from Ormandy's NYPhO make for a performance that will not whet everyone's appetite. Also included: a sonata that sounds more like a Horowitz encore than Rachmaninov. Try Ashkenazy/Fistoulari, Andsnes/Berglund or just about anything else for a better 3rd concerto."
2,The Best Test Preparation for the GRE Psychology Test,"After taking the GRE, I realize that this book did not help me in my preparations. All it managed to do was upset me into thinking I was going to do terrible on the exam. The questions were 10x harder than the exam itself. Also, to my chagrine, the book did not have any review outlines in it - an essential part of test preparation."
1,THUMBS DOWN!,"All that this book contains are practice tests, which although helpful, are not sufficient review material. There is no review section, and answers to questions are not well explained, despite what the author's might think. The answers only discuss the correct answer, and do define the other terms or indicate why they are wrong. As well, the test questions are not broken down into subtests, even for scoring purposes, so they are of little diagnostic help."
1,Terrible!,"DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. Total waste of money. Here's why:1. This book provides no review material whatsoever. It consists of a couple tests and a CD-Rom which has the SAME tests.2. The answers to the test questions are not thorough. Reading over 200 answers will not help you learn the material well, as the questions and information are in random order. This is a very inefficient way to study and difficult for consolidating new information.3. The GRE Psychology test is paper written. I wish I knew before I bought this so-called review book with its CD-rom. It is important to practice taking the test in the format it will be given in.4. Buy a Kaplan Guide--they're cheaper anyway. With this book you're going to have to obtain an Introductory Psych textbook."
1,"Slow shipping, damaged book... overall very disappointed in this seller. I would suggest going to someone else.... ANYONE else.","Dont even bother with this seller. They dont seem to care about getting the product to their customer, or providing what they described."
2,Do not order if you care about presentation,"I have been a fan of Rave Master since I first viewed it years ago. When I saw this on amazon I misread the product details, thinking it was the complete anime series I promptly added it to my wish list and received it for Christmas. Unfortunately it is only the first 12 episodes. my own mistake. However, when I opened the package I noticed that the back of all the DVD cases were gouged into, which as a DVD collector is extremely upsetting to me. In addition to this, when I removed the plastic wrapping from the DVD's I found that one of the corners on disc one was busted and plastic pieces had fallen into the case. The DVDs themselves appear to be fine but the mistreatment and presentation of the cases leaves me dissatisfied as a customer."
5,hillarious blast from the past!,"My bother and I used to watch this on toonami, saturday nights~ It's the best and the price is totally afordable."
2,Not real impressed,"Although I like the way the bouncer looks, that is about all that impresses me about it. Yes all the remote controllers work and it has music, ect. but it doesn't have a lot of give in the fabric so when you place your baby in the bouncer you have to keep your eyes locked on them the entire time they're in the bouncer. Our baby doesn't sink down in the bouncer enough for me to feel safe leaving her in it. In fact the two times I tried putting her in it she leaned to one side and I felt she may fall out of it (at 3 weeks old this should not happen). I have another bouncer that isn't nearly as fancy but the fabric is sewn in a way so that she does sink down in the bouncer more therefore she's more comfortable and so am I knowing she's much safer. We got this bouncer on sale but I wish we wouldn't have spent our money on it in the first place as it's going to be donated to goodwill the next time I take a trip there."
4,Swallowdale - good sequel,"Swallowdale is a very good sequel to the classic Swallows and Amazons. We are reintroduced to the Walkers and Becketts on their next summer holiday. The action is fast paced, and keeps the reader turning the pages. The chapter about the shipwreck is a gem. The dialogue is entertaining, and not without a decent amount of humour, and it is interspaced with delightful descriptive prose passages that show a deep love of the landscape of the lake district while informing the reader of important plot devices. Towards the latter 3/4 it slows down for a chapter of two, but then returns to its strengths for the final race back to Wild Cat Island."
5,An exciting continuation of a great series.,"The second and my favourite of the Swallows and Amazons series starts with a mystery. Where are the Amazons? It continues with a near disaster that threatens the Swallow's entire holiday, but a chance discovery saves the situation.The children explore the hills of the English Lake District, have battles and meet strange but friendly ""natives"" all while trying to keep the Great Aunt happy.It is a great story for children and adults which combines Ransome's characters with exciting but realistic adventures and marvellous descriptions of the English countryside and its inhabitants."
5,How anyone gave this 1 star is beyond me,"Its not a perfect movie, but compared to the similar ultra-violent stylized stuff Hollywood typically puts out (exceptions to some of QT's stuff), this is pretty awesome. The cast is all-star and they deliver. You need to remember that this movie came out years before lots of the Hollywood films this is being compared to. In that sense it was quite groundbreaking. If you like action, and you want to see a different take on the genre, give this a look."
4,ALL OF LETHAL WEAPON,If you enjoy the movies than this is the complete set of 4 on 2 discs. No special features or a collectors set. If you have never seen the movies and enjoy cop shows with lots of action sprinkled with humor than I suggest the Lethal Weapon series. Doubt if Mel or Danny will make another movie so here you have the originals all in a 2 disc set. Good value on just the 4 movies.
3,Good older cop flicks...,...and some may like the young Mel Gibson 'zany' character. The chemistry between the two stars is great. If you've never seen the franchise it's a must!
5,Lethal Weapon Set,How can you beat a set of four movies for this price? I like that the discs are two-sided so I have less DVDs to store. The movies arrived quickly and in great shape.
1,Don't buy the box set - buy the DTS director Cuts versions,I almost bought this but have discovered the hard way that you should ALWAYS research the DVD especially for uncut versions and missing footage. This box set contains the old cut versions and NOT the directors cut DTS versions. LW 1-3 are out on DTS and LW 4 is only available in DD 5.1 and actually contains the missing footage for the previous 3 movies !!!
4,GREAT FOR THE PRICE,"This is great, you get all the LETHAL WEAPONS for the price of one. I got this from Amazon today & am glad I got it. Im a fan of the LETHAL WEAPONS & glad they made this pack. I dont like the cheap case it came with its to thin (not like other DVD cases) but whatever, & why does it not have a insert for the chapters? All in all its great."
4,Blu-ray Review: 'Lethal Weapon Collection',"Warner Bros. Home Entertainment has blessed fans of Mel Gibson and Danny Glover's good cop / crazy cop film series by releasing them all together on Blu-ray in the ""Lethal Weapon Collection."" You get all four movies on separate discs and a bonus one with newly produced extra features. The original DVD special features are included on each individual disc.It's a no-brainer that action fans 1980s buddy cop enthusiasts need to pick up the ""Lethal Weapon Collection."" It's an excellent and convenient way to get all four of these movies in one package to display in your home entertainment library. Plenty of extra features and excellent high-definition transfers should have you racing to the store to pick this up immediately."
5,Great Movies!,"All four are just great!Like one of the other reviewers said, its great how they can keep most of the same characters throughout all four movies, and also introduce new ones. Mel Gibson is a great actor, and in 1 and 2, I think he does the best job. I highly recommend these movies to people that like action packed movies with alot of humor mixed in."
1,"Comes up short, literally","There are many good things one can say about these movies, but ultimately, this package comes up short on content compared to the DVDs. Scenes that are a part of the Director's Cut DVDs are excluded from the blu ray disks, and are instead available as ""Extras"". If you know the DVDs, this can be jarring.Based on run times posted on the DVD cover and the run time for the collection posted here, there appear to be about 7 minutes of content missing across the 4 disks. As such, I can't give this collection more than one star.Caveat emptor!"
5,Action and humor¡,"This is the great movie I ever seen about Mel Gibson, time ago from Mad Max, this thriller genre makes a great and explosive adventure with a couple of good things, Danny Glover are the side of humor as Joe Pesci, Lethal Weapon I and II feature the dark side of the life, Lethal Weapon III and IV, are the white side......"
2,Lethal weapon: 4 Film Favorites,I was very disturbed by the large quantity of profane language as well as the nudity In Lethal Weapon: 4 Film.I would not have ordered this item if I had been previously aware of the bad content.I originally viewed this item on TV and apparently the censored version was more enjoyable.
1,This item was wrong for me...,"First, to me seem an excellent idea to have 4 of my favorites films in one box, but was a sad thing that when i received this item was duplicate one disc (lethal weapon 1 and 2), doesn't contain the second cd of lethal weapon 3 and 4. Very dissapointed of this item, even now i can't get my money back.please check other options..."
1,Over the top,"High speed car chases in city traffic, without regard to innocent civilians. Spectacular wrecks with passengers walking away without a scratch or so much as a limp. Multiple explosions, one of which blows a toilet into the street, without its occupant. Ugly fights that barely leave a scratch on the participants. Wholesale slaughter by gunfire. That about sums it up. There's nothing remotely entertaining to a rational viewer.And I can't watch Mel Gibson without remembering his anti-Jewish rants or his threats to a girlfriend, as reported in the media. I sat through two of the films, and I can't take another."
5,Awesome!,Lethal Weapon is a classic and one of my personal favority cop/action movies that is somewhat reality based. There is no disappointment in this box set - you get exactly what you'd expect - all four movies.
3,WHERE ARE THE DIRECTOR'S CUTS,"i just wanna say that all Films in this set looks great on Blu-ray, but i really wish all of these were the Director's cuts."
3,I wanted more,"I've loved these films since I was very young.I was very excited to see a collection of all four films together.It was interesting to have 2 discs that you flipped over to see the next film as I've never owned discs like this.The disappointment is that there are no real extra features.No interviews, no blooper reels, no featurettes (except for one that was footage from Lethal 2 that was a few minutes).Lethal 4 has a director's commentary but the other 3 films had none, which is such a shame for a much loved film series.Otherwise, I'm still glad I made the purchase."
3,Not worthy of Stat Trek Branding,"Yes this game is fun in its own right, being a generic Platformer for the SNES...which were a dime a dozen in those days, but its not worthy of the Star Trek branding."
4,Really good,"Imagine a more pissed off Jesus Lizard's David Yow being backed by a noisy guitar attack mixed with some prog and industrial stylings and you have Today is the Day. Although I don't care for a lot of the later material, except for In Eyes of God and Temple of the Morning Star, I really recommend Supernova. Rembember this came out around the same time as Korn's debut, and TITD were obviously a far superior, dangerous and groundbreaking band"
5,Thanks for the Memories,"I love Robert Brenner's Christmas collectors' books! I bought Christmas Past some time ago because it not only told you values and showed photos of the old ornaments and candles/lights, but it also included photos of how the trees were decorated and memories from people who lived in that era. When I saw this volume, for the years 1940-1959, I opened the pages and nearly cried: the photos looked just like those of my relatives' homes when I was a small child or photos from my mom's or dad's childhood. The descriptions are quite detailed as well and there are many, many photos of the beautiful ornaments of the time."
4,Absolutely one of the better ones out there,"I don't have kids, I'm just one of those unique people who enjoy learning more about names. I was pleased to find that my name was actually given it's own listing instead of being lumped in with Catherine! This book is more in depth than most baby name books, covering lots of cultures and backgrounds. The author welcomes readers to write with additions and suggestions and choices they made for their children. Overall, a great read and very informative!"
1,I wouldn't name my dog anything from this book.,"This may be the perfect book if you want your kid to be picked on and teased mercilessly. They say it builds character. However if you'd perfer not to have your children curse your name even after you've gone skip this piece of trash. If you want a book with normal names in it definitely skip this. example from the k in girls koruna, kosma, ksena, kuma, kuni, kupona, kura, kuri, kyla, kymberley, kyo, kyra, kyrie, kristine, krystal. Just a little example of the normality of the names."
4,Silver Age Goodness!,"I started reading Green Lantern comics during Blackest Night, and this was recommended to me by a friend who was an ever bigger fan than I am.It was awesome to see the origin of Green Lantern in this Showcase and the first appearances of Sinestro, Hal Jordan, Carol Ferris and Star Sapphire. The powers of the ring seem to be all over the place and a little inconsistent, but still it was fun to read.But be warned that you're going to read the same 2 or 3 editor's notes over and over and over and over again about the yellow impurity in Hal's Ring, and about Carol Ferris.All in all, I say if you're a fan of Green Lantern, check this out so you can see the origins of this awesome hero."
5,Must Have! But mistake on p.419,"Silver age of my childhood, alive, and cheap. A must have. But what happened to GL? P.418 and p.419 are identical. In other words, p.419 is a misprint, and I don't know how GL gets to the Spectarns at that point in the story. It's impractical to dig through my sealed box of silver age originals in the hope that I haven't sold GL #13 which I probably did years ago. I need a p.419. DC should allow us to download a correction."
4,"Well, there certainly is a lot of it","The Green Lantern stories were never exactly narrative masterpieces. First, our hero tries to mack on his boss, Miss Ferris, and just as he's either getting shot down or getting a little action, news arrives of some new threat. He zooms there, finds out that his superpowers don't work, and in a split second, comes up with some clever way to bypass the problem. Eight pages later, it's all wrapped up.But the artwork was always really cool, and the dry humor was either asinine or funny, depending on your perspective. OK so this book is in black and white, but I just happen to like black and white comics, and besides I got it mostly because I'm learning to cartoon, and this book offers an almost unlimited number of drawing subjects and techniques to copy and experiment with."
2,HAL JORDAN IS GREEN LANTERN,This graphic novel features the pilot Hal Jordan a.k.a the Green Lantern. It contains the first issues of the heroes adventures. Overall it is a good deal it cost $9.99 and contains over 500 pages. But on the other hand it is all in black and white and the art work is really cheesy.I would only recommend this book to someone who has never read anything about Green lantern because by reading this you will learn his origin.If you have been reading comics and graphic novels for long time I would not recommend it because after several pages it gets really boring.
3,"Enjoyable read, but start with Walter Wink","I think this is a phenomenal, eye opening book. I read it while working at a bible camp having been stigmatized for taking the kind of views that Jack Nelson Pallmeyer did in this book. It is a fascinating exegesis on the gospels and on the old testament with some good eye opening historical information. However, it is not a book for the light hearted and i think it takes the miracollous wonder of the resurrection away. Pallmeyer seems to want to focus merely on the life of Jesus, which i think is a legitimate topic in more progressive circles. However more literature needs to be done focusing on both issues of Christ, not claiming a conservative or liberal agenda. Pallmeyer really did not provide much new information or insights in the book. While it might be good for a religious scholar to read, I would suggest Walter Wink's books for anyone who wants a good solid introduction to the issue of power and dominance in the church."
5,A must read,This book is great. I recommend it to anyone interested in liberal theology. It is almost an apologetic for non-fundamentalist thinking.
1,Poor Excuse for an Academic Work,"This book is positively awful. I am not a Christian, but this book still presented an extremely poor argument to me. The premise is acceptable, but the author clearly skewes this book to fit his own religious views. He presents it as an academic work but it turns into his own political and religious manifesto. The evidence he presents for his arguments is shaky at best, and many of his biblical translations are completely different than every other source I checked. I do not reccomend this book for anyone."
1,shorts to fit a newborn,"What a disappointment! The sizing chart was completely wrong. After carefully measuring we ordered according to the chart. The shorts we received would not fit a newborn. Shipping prices were exhorbitant($7.00 for $15.00 shorts) and to add insult to injury, I now have to pay again to get the right size. Shipping will cost more than the shorts. I will never buy from east bay again."
2,sizing chart is wrong!,"Although the shorts seem to be of good quality, the sizing chart is WRONG!! My petite daughter is 2 1/2 inches smaller than the XS and the XS we received are too small for her. If you can find a store, try the shorts on and decide what size you want. By the time I deal with returning and paying for more shipping the shorts will be very expensive."
2,not what I expected,"I bought this item for the color and assumed it had a cotton crotch. Not only did it not have a cotton crotch the supposed to be a large fit like a small. Chalk it up as an impulse buy, will not buy any more of these unless from Hanes or Fruit of the Loom and it's cotton."
1,Don't waste your time,"Like other reviewers have said, these shorts are improperly sized. I normally wear size 00 or XXS. I ordered these shorts in a size Small (instead of XS) after reading other warnings about the sizing. To my amazement, the shorts were ridiculously tight -- unwearable. These shorts are either a crude hoax or the result of a manufacturing flaw. Either way, unless you're a toddler in the market for briefs, don't waste your time with this product!"
1,Disgusting!,"Dogs put their lives at risks for their owners, and this author says we love them because they're ""stupid""? Has he ever heard of Old Yeller, Lassie, Rin Tin Tin, Old Dan, Little Ann, and Sounder? All those dogs died to protect their owners! People should NOT have dogs as companions if they're going to be so incredibly ungrateful!"
1,Mostly nauseous material,Ordinarily I pass books I purchase on to a local gay group dedicated to giving teens someplace to meet and talk to others in their age group. Too many of the stories in this collection are inappropriate reading for most of us - including young teens. I was very disappointed with this book.
5,Hard-to-find movie on DVD,"I've been looking for this movie on DVD, for some time. So glad you had it on Amazon.com. Great movie! Thanks!"
2,Wont play,"This dvd will play on my laptop but will not play on any of my dvd players. I keep getting ""disc error"". I got it for my mom for Christmas since its her fav movie and now she can only watch it on the computer. :-("
5,BEAUTIFUL RELAXING MUSIC,"BEAUTIFUL VOICE, BEAUTIFUL MUSIC TO RELAX TOO. HAD THIS CD FOR PROBABLY 5 YEARS AND LOVE HEARING IT."
2,diving masks,These masks have a very small nose space and in both my boys (18yrs and 22yrs) the mask was very uncomfortable to wear.
5,A tragic Venetian poet,"As is usual with Italian poets other than Dante, Stefani is totally unknown in the English-speaking world. I have a collection of his poetry books in Italian, plus this translation by Anthony Reid with illustrations by J. Martin Pitts. I myself had the honor of being Stefani's first translator. I corresponded with both Stefani and Reid. Stefani is one of my favorite poets. People really need to learn Italian so as to explore writers who are rarely translated. Stefani killed himself ten years ago. I was not expecting this and was quite shocked. The theme of his poetry is the same as with Sandro Penna, namely ragazzi. This effectively puts him out of the sympathy range for about, oh, 99% of possible readers. But fine poetry is fine whether you like the theme or not."
1,Wrong Item in your database! I got sunglass lens?,I orderred an Oakley Detornator 10-183 Carbon Fiber-Red Dial Watch for my son's birthday. What I got was a worthless refund and no watch. The company sent me a sunglass lens. Priceless!!!!!!!!!! Be very careful when you order from Amazon.
5,amazing,I could not have survived without this book. I had to write a paper on hamlet and was not able to understand a single word. This cleared everything right up for me.
4,Textbook,"Book arrived on time, the only problem was the package the seller mailed it in. It tore easily and the paper filling made it appear as though there was no textbook."
2,Check your pages,Make sure if you buy this book from amazon that all the pages are in the book. I'm missing pages 577-608!!!!!!!
5,Great,"This book is a great examination of early women's literature in English. I have learned a lot from it so far and I look forward to picking it up again when I have the time. I'm a university English student, so that's high praise."
5,Review,"This anthology is an invaluable resource. It certainly must omit some works that ""should"" be in it. There is only so much space and future editions will surely correct the omissions. I would like to point out, however, that Buck is not the only woman to win both Nobel and Pulitzer. Toni Morrison has also won both awards for her literature."
1,The Little CD Player That Couldn't,"We brought this model home today from the store and sorry to say, I plugged it in and nothing happened. The red light on the on/off button came on, and the screen glowed faintly, but pushing the on/off button resulted in no change in status. I tried following the directions to set the clock; nothing. I tried following the directions to play a CD; nothing again. I tried the remote; nothing. We called customer support. They suggested rubbing a fork along the edge of the power plug...they said it wasn't ""fully"" powered, whatever that means. For me, the light comes on, there's power, right? At any rate, nothing worked. As of tonight it's boxed up and ready to go back to the store and something that actually plays CDs will be the order of the day tomorrow! I can't recommend either the CD player or Memorex's customer support."
1,Actually a 1 rating is too high.,"This was such a waste of money and such a waste of time. There's a lengthy review which refers to the books focus on opium addiction and prostitution in 1880's england. The story line is rather stupid and not believable that the ""midnight angel"" is a female in disguise venturing to the slums in the middle of the night. I don't know why I bought this book but...I tossed it by the end of the 2nd chapter. Even the writing is stilted and formal and the main characters aren't warm and likeable. Can't find a good thing to say about it except that I dumped it."
4,"Smile, You steal away my soul","No longer ""Extra Virgins"", Olive has continued to produce great songs for the down at heart. At first listen I felt like Olive hadn't taken their music to the next level, but the more I listened the more I realized how mature their sound had become. Ruth-Ann's vocals are superb. She has, by far, one of the best female voices in pop today. This CD is a must if you are an Olive Fan. If you enjoy music that has soul with an electronica mix, then Olive is the way to go. BUY IT BUY IT!"
2,Nothing New,"Having heard ""I'm Not In Love"" in the midst of a mix cd by Paul Oakenfold, I picked this up to check out more of what Olive had done. I was disappointed; I knew that Oakenfold had put a fast backbeat behind the track, but the dragginess of this album completely astonished me. My best description would be Aimee Mann after a bad weekend of mushrooms singing along to an amateur DJ. The only saving grace comes from Liberty, which has a slightly more interesting backbeat, and Beyond the Fray, which is faster and more interesting than the rest of the CD. The vocals on this CD make for great mixing potential and would sound great laid on top of drum 'n' bass (a la THC).Conclusion: Check out Morcheeba or Kruder & Dorfmeister instead."
2,Dead End Move,Trickle retains little feel of the original emotion in the lyrics from Extra Virgin. Definetely an album engineered for a different audience than its predecesor. Fans of Extra Virgin should expect dissapointment. Mp3ers who foud the acid&scribble remix of 'Not In Love' will be equally unsatisfied.
1,"Flat, Colorless Sophmore Effort","I was compelled to buy this album after hearing the sensational Acid & Skribble remix of ""I'm Not in Love"" at a dance club, plus I liked a couple of the tracks on the first Olive album. Boy, was I disappointed. Not a single song here is worthy of radio play. Nothing's catchy, nothing's beautiful (except the singing). I hate to be so harsh, but I really think it was a waste of studio time and plastic, easily the weakest album I've bought all year."
2,TRICKLED DOWN TO A MERE DRIP.,"Olive last cd ""Extra Virgin"" was a 4 star electronic dance wizardry.....Now we have ""Trickle"" which is definitely that, a mere trickle of average electronic beats, and disco flash.Their first single ""I'm Not In Love"" is at the top of the club play scene, however this is a remake of a classic, which shows no comparison to the original.When a group comes out with a new album and their first single is a remake classic i.e. Ace of Base ""Cruel Summer"", you know you have a poor compilation on your hands if the first single cannot be original music.The rest of the songs continue with the same mundane sound through the whole entire album with ""Trickle"", ""Love Affair"", etc. Unfortunately the dismal remake of the classic ""I'm Not In Love"" is the really only high point on this album.I give it 2 stars instead of 1 because it is not absolute trash.A fair CD at best, I say pick up ""Extra Virgin"" and skip this electronic bore."
4,Really good overall effort,"After getting ""Extra Virgin"" I really liked this band enough to get more from them. ""Trickle"" sounds more pop oriented to me. It has a nece dreamy feel that runs through most of the album. I was surprised to hear such a great version of I'm Not In Love, 10cc's '70's classic, it receives an excellent makeover by Olive. I love every single song on ""Trickle"" I also feel that the lyrics and music are a lot better than their debut. There are some good mellow songs that I really like as well. I highly recommend this to anyone who likes a mixture of trip hop, pop and electronic oriented music. The CD cover looks strange, but the music sounds nothing like what you would expect from the cover.There is also a hidden bonus track here, that is really good, I would like to try to find out the name of the song. Really good overall effort."
4,classy trip pop,"Olive have started out with a nice trip hop album, ""Extra Virgin"". ""Trickle"" is a bit more focussed on the pop, let's say trip pop. And they r doing it with style. This is intelligent dance music, with beautiful strings, some r'n'b influences, some sligth drum'n'bass, like in ""I'm Not In Love"" and ""Beyond The Fray"" ( and don't stop it right after that nice song has stopped, because they have another nice bonus track waiting ). I think the album grabs your attention from the beginning with the opener ""Love Affair"". Most of the songs seem to deal with relationships.The best songs r ""Push"", ""Smile"" and ""Beyond The Fray""."
3,Like eating popcorn without salt.,"Nice arrangements and interesting lyrics for the most part, but ""Trickle"" doesn't have quite the emotional depth, whimsy and originality found on their debut release. Their sound is a bit more refined, but is also more middle of the road with less hooks to catch your attention. I find myself skipping over track #3, ""I'm Not In Love"" simply because I'm not terribly fond of remakes. It's certainly a listenable cd, but I think Olive tried to hard to make a cd that was superior to or more successful than their debut, which distracted them from sustaining the quirky charisma found on ""Extra Virgin"". Overall you probably won't be too disappointed, but maybe slightly, that is, if you are expecting tunes as catchy as their trademark song ""You're Not Alone""."
4,"Sooo relaxing, I took it out of the CD player","I got this CD player that starts in the morning and wakes you up with the tracks you like, I had to take this one out because it's so relaxing I kept on dreaming nice dreams. The combination of triphop beats and smooth voices is perfect. I got this one because I was in need of another triphop CD, as I got only trance lately, and I'm not regretting this one. When you already got all the Massive Attack CD's get one from Olive."
1,Dishones DVD Cover Description,"It is interesting that my previous review of this movie was removed from this web site; I guess the judgment of millions of people throughout recorded history is 'inferior' the latest notions. If they let this one stand, I'll just say that my wife and I were utterly outraged that the seemingly adoption-friendly description on the DVD cover turning into anti-religious faith bigotry. Anyone who has any sense of traditional morality, especially that rooted in the wisdom centuries of religious faith, should avoid this movie. I'd better not say what this movie is really about lest they censor this one as well. How many other negative reviews have been written here about this dishonest movie have been censored?"
5,"Beautifully filmed, emotionally moving","What an incredibly moving film - I am an adoptee that searched for her mom, only to find that she had died many years ago. This film is right on in the representations of adoptees and mothers searching - the acting is so true to life and the images have stayed with me. This is one of my absolute favorite films ever - I was moved to tears many times. Incredible film -"
3,hmmm...,"i'd passed this by in the video store a few times before going online and adding it to my movie list...i thought it was pretty decent actually, well acted, sad, i like how the lives and stories were intertwined, that was pretty subtle yet very understanding and sad in a good way, i hope that makes sense, the ending sad though, which i think was the underpinning of the movie itself, so it all came together in the end, but i was hoping for something happy/sad or sad/happy, not necessarily in those orders...either way to those contemplating on watching it, rent first and maybe buy later..."
2,Ultimately disappointing,"This film had a lot of potential--interesting premise, compelling characters and a strong cast--but something keeps it from gelling into a satisfying story. There's a flatness to the film that is probably the fault of the director. The above-average cast, that includes the wonderful Bonnie Hunt, Michael Learned and several other very likable young actors, seems squandered somehow by a lackluster dialogue and unrelenting low key tone. The redemption that this viewer wanted to see emerge from the script at the conclusion didn't quite make it. A pity as, despite the film's continuing weaknesses, I wanted more than melancholy for its lead characters."
2,This deserved a happy ending.,"I like happy endings, but when it comes to have a sad one, I do like a good reason for the non-happy ending. This doesn't seem to give one. I kept waiting something to happen, but it didn't. There's no romance."
5,Outstanding,"One of the rare gems of the 2005 Verzaubert International Queer Film Festival in Munich Germany, Loggerheads is an excellent film that really stood out among the pack of mediocre films that played the festival. This film was not just one the best gay themed films I've ever seen but is also a great example of what filmmaking should be. Great story!"
5,Cool country,"Ronna's voice is great, the songs are meaningful, and the music is great. Even non-country fans will find themselves grooving along with this album. Excellent Ronna."
1,Made in China,Our dogs love these treats and 2 years ago were made in the U.S. We thought we were giving them something healthy until we read the package and saw that they were now made in China. We are now looking for a similar product made in USA.
3,Not enough glucosamine and chondroitin,"My dogs like these treats well enough. My question is regarding the amounts of glucosamine and chondroitin that they incorporate.According to what I'm looking at, you need around 300-500mg of each per 25lbs of dog, per day. The bag ingredients says 2000mg/kg of glucosamine and 1000mg/kg of chondroitin. So that means my 100lb dog would need to eat 2lbs of this treat every day to get a satisfactory dose, since a kg is 2.2lbs.Reading the reviews of the various versions of this treat, I'm also wondering how much of the perceived results are scientifically due to the supplements. I see a lot of people noting improvements and results in a week or two, yet glucosamine and chondroitin are supposed to take 4-6 weeks before they produce a noticeable benefit.For our big, fat, old dogs, we've had good luck with the vetrin chewable aspirin for dogs. They like them, they're inexpensive, and they do a nice job of taking the squeak and creak out of the dogs."
2,Product was stale,"Although the package had an expiration date of 02/2014, these strips were stale and brittle. I checked stock at a pet store of the identical product and the strips were flexible as jerky should be. The seller had a no return policy, but Amazon was able to give me a full refund."
2,Soccer Mom,"This chair is super cute and my daughter loves it, but the material is very rough and it looks like it's cracking already. We've only had it for a month or so."
1,Stick with the originals,There are only two good covers on this whole album. The cover of Y Control and the cover of Our Time. This album isn't worth buying. I would only reccomend getting this if you love everything involving YYY and are a collector or something like that (such as myself) But otherwise I would'nt buy it. Even the inclusion of a song by Nico and the songs that weren't even YYy covers didn't improve the album for me.
1,No No No!,"Im quite sorry that anybody would wish to attempt the electric, sexy enigma that is Karen and co.. but if some person were to, at least make it good! If you love the YYYs this is an abhorrent noise. i dont believe anybody should feel obliged to waste pennies on this!! These remakes of classy songs are so terrible. I can sort-of appreciate these strangers have tried to make the tunes their own, but no song upong this album encapsultes the YYYs magic we know and love. Did the band allow for this to be made??!?!As a YYYs fanatic it has saddened me to think people are.. doing this. Making that! Try proper YYYs merchandise or decent music instead. New YYYs album out soon anyway. So hold on for that one guys and gals! L.M. Xx"
5,Deserves more attention than it's getting. Excellent CD!,"This CD is a great testament of how good country music should sound like. The songs, for the most part, are top-notch material. ""Paradise"" is a great song about his time in the Army. ""I Want Us Back"" is a great song, too. ""Something To Write Home About"" is my favorite. A great song about a man who is excited about a woman he cares about, and wants to tell his parents about it. There's not a throwaway on this CD. The best are ""Something To Write Home About"", ""302 South Maple Avenue"", ""It's Me"", ""Paradise"", ""Everywhere I Go"", and ""I Wish I Could See Bakersfield."" This is good, mostly traditional country music that deserves more airplay than it gets. Keep it going, Craig."
5,Definetly something to write about,"What a wonderful artist! Where do I start... The songs on this record are sure to please your ears. Songs such as ""Something to Write Home About"", ""Paradise"", and ""302 South Maple Avenue"", will keep you in anticipation for the next song. I had to purchase this CD for the simple fact of his voice. A very original, wonderful voice. A one of a kind singer. Please have a listen to some of the samples, I'm sure you will fall in love with his music!"
5,Craig Morgan is the real deal.,He can really sing - songwriting is excellent as well. When I first heard Almost Home I felt the same way as I did when I first heard Garth Brooks. I got Craig's first & second cd from listening to that release. Good variety of material on both his cds.Worth the money for sure!
5,Paradise,"I heard part of this song and I had to hear it again. After buying the CD I have listened to this song over and over again.I don't know if he was ever in the army, however for those of us that served myselfe from '86 to '96 this song has very strong meaning. my hats off to Craig Morgan!"
3,Interesting.,"Gary Gygax, Master of the Game (Perigee, 1989)I picked this up blind hoping I'd found an autobiography by the co-creator of Dungeons and Dragons, but alas, it was not to be. What it is, however, certainly has merit: a guide to making yourself into a better Game Master from a guy who's been doing it for pretty much his whole adult life. It's basically an inspirational-business title for gamers. (Think The Seven Habits of Highly Effective Half-Orcs combined with Start and Run Your Own Money-Making Tavern.) It gets a bit self-aggrandizing at times, which can be grating, but can you blame the guy? After all, he did write most of the early source material."
4,Book review,"A pioneer of the ""Master Game"". Not to be used as a ""how too"" book but as an explanation and stimulation for those who want to play the ""Master Game""!"
2,totally outdone by the 4e Dungeon Master's Guide,"I bought this thinking that it was a semi-autobiographical book in which Gygax talked about the creation and development of D&D.; Not the case: this is his advice on how to perfect your skills as a game master and get the players involved. There's almost no autobiographical information in it.Having read both, I would say this has been completely blown out of the water by the 4e Dungeon Master's Guide, whose wealth of sage counsel on this topic makes Gygax look like a neophyte. True, James Wyatt has like 30+ years of experience and all of Gygax's wisdom to build on, but still."
3,Don't overlook this one!,"While not as well-crafted as Araki's ""The Living End,"" this little movie should not be overshadowed by his more well-known work. Though some of the dialogue and acting is a bit amateurish, it is an interesting film for the most part. James Duvall (who has quickly become the ""Jimmy Stewart"" to Araki's ""Hitchcock"") delivers a memorable performance, all the more impressive because it's his very first. Definitely recommended!"
1,Horrible Movie With Fabricated Good Things About It,"Gregg Araki's ""Totally F***ed Up"" is one of the most horrible movies ever created. The break in segments, flashing signs of quotes to live by, have no relevance to the movie. The characters are all typically fake. You don't believe any of them are gay except Deric and he's bashed during the film. Then the ending...how miserable! I believe that films like this should not exist outside of the ""hard to understand Sundance Film Festival"" category."
1,Devastating how she misunderstands things,"Being a survivor myself I really need books like that ... and the beginning was great, the details and facts. However when I came to the chapter of incest between siblings and she explains that it is more a problem for the elder brother than for the younger sister and downplays the situation among siblings, I thought this book needs to be burnt and taken off the selling list. This is a total non-understanding of the situation and adds to the guilt of the smaller sister in this case. Unbelievable how an author can put things the ways she did. Besides that - there is a lot, a hell of a lot of self-promotion which is not exactly what somebody concerned needs."
1,Freud must perish,"I was hoping to gain insight into the repercussions of incest. I couldn't get past the beginning of the book, as it was filled with Freudian pseudoscience.Perhaps another revision is in order."
1,"Retro, anybody? And not in a good way...","The fact that this is ""back by popular demand"" makes me continue to seriously question peoples' judgment. Newsflash: women can grow up and lead incredible lives without living vicariously through children. But I appreciate the entertainment value; this product being a ""good educational tool"" gave me a good laugh!"
2,bad or good,yea the dols pretty but it breaks easy.and not to mention its gross. i mean if you want to teach your kids about pregnant people tell them the baby came from the store or say ill tell you when your older.i mean buying this doll is asking for trouble.
1,hate it,my daugter loves this doll but i dont think they should make pregnant doll whats that going to teach my girl that its allrigt to be pregnant? its jus my opinion
5,Beautiful,"In my opinion, this is a wonderful way to teach a kid about Pregnancy and Babies! The entire Happy Family collection is a 'must' own, from the dollhouse to the dolls!I have the grandma doll, a Midge doll and the house and i love them all!Midge is dressed from head-to-toe in gorgeous outfits! I have to recomend this doll to you! It is a 'must' own for kids of all ages!!!"
5,"Fabulous, educational toy!","I have wanted to purchase this doll for YEARS, and now that we have twin girls, I got to order TWO! Last time I checked, myself and all the other reviewers are here on this earth due to their very own MOTHER'S being pregnant. <GASP!> What has this world come to? All kids know a pregnant woman has a baby in their tummy. What is the big deal? I highly doubt that because of this doll, my 19 month old twins are going to be looking to get pregnant any time in the near future. This doll is a wonderfully educational tool and I wouldn't doubt it if my 4 year old son will want to play too. Yay Barbie! I will buy ALL the pregnant Barbie's you come out with!"
4,Crazy!,"I saw this on here and I saw the price and the first thing I thought: ""oh my god!"" I used to have this exact doll when I was younger. *facepalm* I don't know where all of her is... If only I had known!"
5,Pregnant Midge Doll,"This is my all time fav toy. I always wanted this doll to come out so i wouldn't have to mess with cotton and stuff to make my barbies pregnant. I think this doll is just fine for little kids, they love when they get little brothers and sisters or whatever, so what's the difference? This doll is like the only one that I play with, and i'm twelve!"
1,Why is this GAMESTOP branded ?,"It took 10 days to get here. And when it did , it's a GAMESTOP branded controller. The same one I foundthey carry at their brick and mortar store. The one's in the store is white, this is black (or indigo, whatever), but look for look andfunction for function it's the same. Submitted the return request as soon as I opened it and saw the product. Doubtful I'll get an approval.I'll just hack together a controller of my preference. This is annoying."
5,"Majestic,simply Betha-majestic","In this work,Maria expresses all her dramatic abilities and unusually gifted vocal traits via solo renditions such as TOCANDO EM FRENTE and QUASE but also through collaborations with NINA SIMONE(PRONTA PRA CANTAR) and a great mentor,JOAO GILBERTO(MARIA/LINDA FLOR).It marked her 25th anniversary of the beginning of her career in a majestic manner.Definitely a winner I proudly own."
4,One of her better '90s albums,"Two samba tracks bookend this set, in which she largely veers away from the tropicalia composers and explores instead the sultry blues ballad. Appropriately, Nina Simone is a guest on one track, but Bethania shines on the midnight-at-the-bar ballad, ""Logrador."" A few mildly cloying moments, but on the whole a rather solid album."
4,Magical Musical Misadventures......,"How do they continue to do it over and over? The incredible melodies and atmosphere this band's music conjure up never cease to amaze me. As the wonderful liner notes say, ""Saint Etienne's music has always been described as 'cinematic'..."" and indeed, it is about time that they have a soundtrack album.Even though there are only 5 songs that are over three minutes, I suppose no one ever said a good song had to be a certain length. From the opening 40 second ""Statues"" (which is actually a re-hashed reverb/synth-heavy version of the opening notes of Shad Thames from Continental) to the absolutely sweet 2 minute 25 second ""It's all gone horribly wrong"", each track evokes something for me. Granted, I am a die-hard fan, but for those who enjoyed Good Humor OR Fairfax High, this CD is well worth it. AND DO NOT GO TO ONE OF THOSE AUCTION SITES AND BID FOR A CD YOU CAN GET RIGHT HERE ON Amazon!!I recommend this one!!"
5,Just close your eyes and let the music take you away.,"So this album costs 33 bucks. It is worth every single penny - no, I'm not exaggerating. Misadventures is an absolutely fabulous soundtrack. Since singer Sarah Cracknell only sings on 7 out of the 20 songs on the album, the music is brought to the foreground. Light piano twinkling comprises many of these instrumentals, and it evokes many different moods - dreamy fantasies in 'Dream Dentist', searching for something (but not sure what that is) in 'Lost In the Library', and despairing confusion in 'Edward Undecided'. That said, Sarah's voice is as good as it's always been. The standout track, 'The Way I Fell For You', could be a perfect choice for some movie's ending credits. And I haven't seen the movie which this is taken from, so hey, maybe it is. Regardless, this is a beautiful album for anyone who likes pop music, but who also wants to be taken on a journey. Like I said, worth every cent. Trust me."
5,THIS CD HUGS YOUR SOUL,"This is the album that I wanted to listen to when last spring's icky ""Places to Visit"" was released on SubPop. Like that EP, ""Misadventures"" is mostly instrumental noodlings, with a minimum of Sarah Cracknell's vocals. UNlike that EP, ""Misadventures"" is a delight to listen to, from beginning to end. Maybe it's because they're better off limiting their experimental instrumentals to 40-second blips, rather than rambling 5-8 minute battle hymns. And maybe it's also because St. Etienne is making the kind of music they do best - songs that sound like they should be in a film. Which, ironically enough, they should have been. In my opinion, this is Saint Etienne's best album since ""Tiger Bay."" Totally, completely worth the money, no doubt about it."
3,Not their best,"The music on this album did fit the film quite well (the film went straight to video in the States and was never released in Britain to my knowledge), but it does not translate well to a non-soundtrack release, which is what this became when the 'Margaret' project went pear-shaped. The songs with vocals are mostly good, and some are very good, especially Jack Lemmon and The Way I Fell For You, but most of the instrumentals are boring and mostly held together by the same melodic thread. All in all, not their best music, but pretty good for a first go at scoring a film."
1,disappointed in Glyndebourne production of Porgy and Bess,"I read your reviews of P&B; productions and settled on this one because of a glowing report by someone. I was very disappointed. First, it was at least 30 minutes too long. It could easily have been an hour shorter with nothing important left out. Good photography and sound, good singing and acting for the most part, but ""Summertime"" was far too slow in tempo. Maddeningly slow. George would never have allowed that. But the worst was the ending, with Porgy suddenly able to walk, just like Amahl! How corny can you get??? What made the producers think they could improve the story? And why a cane instead of a wheeled cart? What makes modern fools think they can improve on a classic? A fatal delusion. I'll have to keep looking for a better production. Any suggestions?Richard"
5,Porky and Bess 1959,"I loved this movie growing up as a child. I have trying for years to get a copy. I've been telling my children about it for years, and we have seen another version on the pbs channel. That doesn't even come close to the original. Please if it ever comes out on VHS/DVD I want to be on that list. Was it really destroyed, I've heard that before, if so, do you know why??"
3,"Good, but not as good as the 50's version",I haven't seen it in some years.. Therefore I must refrain from saying too much.. I too am waiting for the 50's movie to come out on video.. One of my favorite movies.. Put my name on the anxiously waiting list..
4,George Gershwin - Porky & Bess,George Gershwin - Porgy & Bess / Trevor Nunn Sir Simon Rattle W. White C. Haymon Glyndebourne Opera
2,Please bring back the original version.,"I would love to see the original version of 1958 with Sidney Poiter and Dorothy Dandridge. How can a person get a copy?? Help, I will pay."
3,Good but not up to the original by a long shot.,I am writing to register my agreement with the other reviews. Finally I know why the original Porgy & Bess is not out on videotape. Do we have to wait for Sidney Poitier to die to see that wonderful version of Porgy & Bess? Can you let him know how many of his fans want to see this movie again and do not consider it demeaning to him or his race?
2,Lackluster,"While the singing is lovely and the music, in general, is well performed -- the dramatic content of this production is severely lacking. I've never seen such a low-key bunch of mourners in my life! The ensemble looks embarrassed to be singing. In fact, everyone in this production seems to be trying to avoid the obvious -- IT'S AN OPERA! They all look like they are trying to pretend that they are speaking rather than singing. The emotions are small and this production falls far short of the mark. Gershwin's musical and emotional masterpiece presented musically, but without emotion. Sad."
3,From a twentysomething point of view,"i have seen this version on TV and tape before and found it to be well done. Until finding this site i wasnt even aware there was a version from the 1950's with such great stars,no, Icons, as Sidney Poitier, Dorothy Dandridge, Sammy Davis Jr., etc. Having said that I'm sure this 90's version does this no justice. I have always loved the story of Porgy and Bess, and in college had the opportunity to hear one of the older soundtracks with Leontyne Price and Paul Robeson and others while researching the life of G. Gershwin. So my point of view is whatever version you can get your hands on, watch it. If anyone out there has the 50's version, email me PLEASE! For posterity's sake!"
2,"Music was average, Production was marginal and distracting","We found the video to be a poor production and hardly enjoyable. I recognized it wasn't the musical production with Sidney Portier when I ordered it but was expecting something as good. The most unfortunate aspect of this version is that 90% of the voices were over-dubbed (and very badly at that)despite the songs being ""lip synched"" by the original performers."
2,Not what I expected,I was mistaken. I was expecting a live production but everything was dubbed. It was distracting.
2,Not as earthy as the 1958 film version,I was disappointed with this video. I remember the 58 film version and have copies of the original soundtrack (minus Sammy Davis)and find the music lush and full. Regardless of the alleged dubbing problems I still think the original film version was superb. Has anyone any info on how we might get the Gershwin family to change their mind and release the 58 version on video???
2,Bring Back The Original 1958 Version Please!,"For sentimental reasons, I would really like to see the 1958 version released on video. My grandmother took me, my sister, and my best friend to see it when it came out. It would be great to have this video. From the looks of this page, it seems many people would buy this video. Wake up, studios!"
2,It's ok but I'd rather see the real one.,Since so many people want to see the real one why can't it be shown again
3,Not the best story line,"I bought this for my wife. She had seen it before and liked it. I had never seen it, but was very familiar with much of the music. I loved the music, but was bored with every other aspect of the story."
4,Comparison,"Although this operatic version of Porgy and Bess is excellent, I really preferred the film version."
1,Poor reproduction of original,"I have to agree with the rest who have seen the original. Please find a way to help get the original on tape. If Sidney is the hold up, as one of the reviews mentioned, I think he should be ashamed of himself. I've always thought of him a one of our greatest actors, and it upsets me to think that he would be the hold up of such a wonderful film. How he could think that the part he played in it was menial, is beyond me! Shame on him! I wish he would read this! Please find a way to get this movie for all of us."
1,I haven't seen the new release.,"I will settle for nothing less than the original with Sidney, Sammy, Pearl & Dorthy. It is my understanding that Sidney is the hold up because he thought it to be so demeaning a role. It is in popular demand. I've been waiting for years and years to see it. The performances were Oscar worthy. Please, Please I'd like to see it before I die (smile)"
3,"OK FOR AN IMITATION, BUT I'D LOVE TO SEE THE REAL THING",I'D GIVE MY RIGHT ARM ( WELL MAYBE NOT THAT ) BUT I WOULD PAY DEARLY FOR A COPY OF THE 1959 VERSION
2,Wanted: 1958 film release,Porgy & Bess-Comp Opera is a disappointment. The film moved slowly and had none of the vitality of the 1958 release. This version misses the beat.
3,Would love to see the orginal,I have searched everywhere for the orignal version of Porgy & Bess. I don't understand what the problem is. Does anyone know?
2,Lacklustre rendering of the opera,"This is primarily intended for all those other reviewers on this page who were disappointed at ""being duped"". The TODD-AO Preminger film version will probably not be seen for a very long time as those in control of the Gershwin estate loathe it and have permanently barred it from being screened as a film, being shown on television or being released on video. Since they retain the music rights and without their consent, the film cannot be exhibited, it looks as though this film is headed for oblivion. The same holds true of ANNIE GET YOUR GUN which the Irving Berlin Estate is barring for the same reasons. These remain the only two films of important Broadway musicals that have never been released to video."
2,Doesn't compare to original version.,"I have to join the rest of the gang in begging for the release of the 1958 five star version with Dorothy Dandridge and Sidney Portier and Sammy Davis Jr. As everyone has said, it's in high demand, mainly because it's so wonderfully filmed. Please find it. Think of the bucks you'd make."
2,Fair comparison to the 58 original,"I already have this two set video. It is only a fair comparison to the original film with Sidney Potier, Dorothy Dandridge, Sammy Davis, Pearl Bailey, Brock Peters, Harry Belefonte. There should be sone way to get an original copy done. There are a lot of people who remember that one and would like to add it to their film library. I am a senior citizen and these are film that are worth handing to the next generation. New is fine but sometimes you must go back to the beginning to see some things. I have been searching for this movie for a long time. Movie and records shops apparently have not heaard of it nor seen it. Its like it never existed. But I know for fact it was amovie because I saw it here in Cincinnati. Please if it every becomes available many of us will buy it."
4,What difference does it make?,"Regardless of George's or Otto's versions of Porgy and Bess, it would be great to have access to ALL versions. Some have said that Otto's version is the ""Reader Digest"" version, well this version got me interested ( as a child) in the more ""Operaic"" version and it is NOT harmful to spoon feed those who you are attempting to gain some interest in Opera. You know Opera can be overwhelming to some folks. Otto's version is not available, for whatever reason, but should be and I would love to have it in my collections. It is important that everyone get exposed to all genre of musice and theatrical productions in the best way as possible. I commend those actors and actresses in Otto's version for a fine performance...oh some of them when on to become great actors and actresses...hmmmm"
2,"Good..! But NOT the 'Porgy and Bess"" I had remembered.","Hey Sidney... Are you out there...? Where can I get a copy of the Video 'Porgy and Bess' with Sidney Poitier, Dorothy Dandridge, Pearl Bailey, Sammy Davis Jr. and other greats. For years I have been looking for this film. No one seems to have any idea!"
3,"Saw this, but would like 50's version on VHS","In checking the info on P&B, I noticed that it will be coming out soon on DVD only. Why is it not coming out on VHS? I have been wanting this film for many years and did not know why it was never in print. I figured it had something to do with the estate...guess I was right, according to another reviewer's info. I never saw the whole movie; I believe I saw part of it on TV many years ago before it was pulled. Would really like to see it out again; I guess there is no soundtrack, either, for the same reason. I do have a cassette of the operatic version."
5,Apology to Amazon,"I first ordered Porgy from a company called ""moviemars"" which I found in Amazon's NEW and USED listings. I paid for faster delivery, but moviemars didn't even look at my order for 3 days. When I checked moviemars out on Google, there were so many complaints about them that I panicked and purchased a backup copy directly from Amazon. Moviemars took more than a week, but they did get it to me in time for my needs. Because Amazon cost about $10 more, I returned Amazon and kept moviemars.I am a bit embarrassed about taking advantage of Amazon's kind return policies, but I also think Amazon should be more careful of which companies they recommend. After all, Amazon was able to deliver in only 2 days, whereas moviemars hadn't even started packing my purchase 3 days after they received it!.Bottom line: Buy direct from Amazon most of the time. Check Amazon's alternative suppliers on Google before trusting them."
3,As good as it's going to get,"I don't know about Sydney Poitier's feelings about the 1958 version of Porgy and Bess but, from what I've read, the Gershwin family wasn't impressed and it is the Gershwin estate that will not allow the video release of that version. Having said that, I liked this version, the 1958 cast was a hard act to follow but I think they did admirably."
2,Sam Goldwyn did a better job,"Filmed in Todd-AO and six-track stereo, Samuel Goldwyn's loving treatment of the Gershwin masterpiece--with a once-in-a-lifetime cast--could and should be digitally remastered, enhanced with Dolby, and released in the appropriate aspect ratio of 2.2:1 so that new generations can bask in its wonder. The currently available version is musically fine but visually and dramatically flat by comparison with the 1959 Goldwyn release."
2,Why is the original being withheld?,Perhaps it's not PC for the time? Please release the 1959 version
1,Bring back the 1959 version please,"I'd also like for the soundtrack album to be released. I searched the internet for a week trying to find this version of the soundtrack. Luckily one Saturday, while garage saleing, I found it. I am in Porgy and Bess heaven now."
2,"Please, please, offer the original Sidney Portier movie!","I only want to see the original version. I have seen live performances and remakes, but none can compare."
1,Almost purchased - read reviews below & reconsidered.,"PUT ME ON THE LIST FOR THE SIDNEY POITIER VERSION ALSO....HAVE LOOKED ALL OVER FOR IT, FOR YEARS. ALMOST PURCHASED THE ABOVE VERSION...BUT DECIDED TO PASS. IT'S NICE TO KNOW I'M NOT ALONE ON THIS QUEST. I HAVE THE ORIGINAL LP BUT IT'S NATURALLY PRETTY SCRATCHY AFTER ALL THESE YEARS. ANYONE KNOW IF THE RECORDING IS AVAILABLE ANYWHERE? THANK YOU."
1,Some of the original beauty of this movie was lost.,"Remakes are rarely as good as the original and this one is no exception. I would like to also be notified when the original is ever available, the 1959 version."
1,SHAME SHAME SHAME!!!!!!!!!,"The most dissappointing opera (film) I have ever seen. After waiting for so long for a proper version of this cornerstone of american music, to see the performers lip sync their way through a performance even though on tape, BARBARIC!! The sound quality was horrible as well. Do justice to the only true american opera and bring the cameras to New York City Opera, and see what Porgy and Bess should really sound. If I could get my money back on this shamefull production I would at the drop of a hat."
1,This video was disappointing and not what I expected.,"Where in the world is the original Gershwin musical ""Porgie and Bess""? This movie starred Sidney Portier, Dorothy Dandridge, Pearl Bailey, Sammy Davis Jr., Leslie Uggums, etc. It is a precious, cultural classic and cannot be compared to the 1986 disappointing effort."
4,Porgy and Bess Original,"I am so thankful for Michael Evans' review. I too have been looking for the original version of Porgy and Bess, I saw it as a child. Is there any way to plead and beg the Gershwins to release the 1959 original version? I would love to see it again in my lifetime. If anyone out there has one of the original copies, please, please, please, please, please let us P & B searchers know. Good luck everyone!"
4,Too Slim is way cool!,"Too slim,also known as Tim Langford, and the boys have produce anthor electric masterpiece. This CD has a new funk-a-delic frosting that brings out the pure blues tone in any Too Slim feast. Too Slim's haunting slide playing is just way cool! Do yourself a favor and sample this CD. It will keep your toes taping and your mouth watering."
5,H.O.T.S. Video DVD,"This was another case where I did Not pay close enough attention to the R Rating, and a friend became the new owner of this DVD as well. The rating was clearly indicated in the Ad, I just overlooked it. THANKS"
3,guilty pleasure in the spirit of Animal House..,"The members of H.O.T.S. sorority begin their crusade to party down and woo every male on their unsuspecting college campus. Dressed to thrill, and flashing mile-wide smiles, the lovey ladies transform their formerly uptight university into a sex-crazed fun house. But all is not well for the fledgling sorority, as the snooty, prim and proper girls of the Pi Sorority try to stop the H.O.T.S. girls at every turn."
2,A true Bimbo-stein Extravaganza!,"This is one of those even-less-than-low low budget films of the late seventies. It's just your typical sorority house boob-fest with a lot of unknown actresses and actors. The only familiar actor I've seen in this film was Danny Bonaduce (from The Partridge Family).Lots of topless nudity, adding hope to all that atrocious bad acting from every character. But still, I'd never miss a cheesy, campy, ditzy girls-gone-wild eye-candy film to kill some time on my weekends while having a few beers.It's up there (well, maybe down there) with Pom Pom Girls, The Van, and the such for typical low budget politically incorrect ""babe fests""."
3,"Boobs, frivolity, boobs, and did I say boobs","Not much to add as many of the other reviewers describe this piece of goofy frivolity perfectly. The ""high point"" is the football game at the end. Playboy Playmates, breasts, and goofy hijinks. There really isn't much reason to watch this other than the fact there are a lot of topless women in this movie. 'Nuf said."
5,H.O.T.S. is HOTS!,"I remember these 'B' movies from way back...in fact I remember when Susan Kiger became a playmate! Great watch! The plot? What does it matter! If you are like me, plots in these old flicks never meant anything, we watched for the women! Still a kid at heart? This is for you!"
2,Classic Low Budget Movie,You may saw it on USA Up All Night. Same movie unedited without the dub scenes. Very poor quality video but you would expect from a movie from 1979.
4,Sexy skin shots,"Saw this movie when HBO had it on - years ago. Remember it for having a weak story line, but it more than made up for it with female full nudity (all thru the movie)! Young flesh is always nice to view, especially their sports competition at the movies end."
3,Silly 1970's fun,"I saw this movie as a teenager at the old Paramount theater in San Juan. So it brings back some great memories of days when one had to struggle to see naughty R-rated movies. Seeing it again as an adult was interestimg, The humor is pretty dumb, but the girls are still sexy. And the movie has a ""devil-may-care"" attitude which is refreshing.The strip football game is fun to watch.The DVD is pretty plain. It just features a trailer. It would have been nice to have has a director's or cast commentary. Or to see how the HOTS girls are doing. Although, perhaps, its better to remember them as they were back in the 70's."
3,SHAKE................SHAKE IT!,"H.O.T.S. stars Danny(PARTRIDGE FAMILY)Bonaduce as a famous celebrity M.C.(hey who said Danny couldn't act)and the shining moment for me,out side the nude scenes of course :) is when Danny gets on stage to sing the song ""SHAKE IT BABY"" a song which has no other words but that? Also later in the film we see Danny in bed with a live seal(NO! NOT THE SINGER)there are lots of flopping nude women in this movie and the end football scene between the H.O.T.S & the P.I.E. leaves on a great climax. This is not a great movie but has that 70's innocence that seems to be gone now in movies today. This was one of the first movies I watched spending the night at my bros NO LONGER DEVILS house and it was great to see this when the parents had gone to bed ;) So buy H.O.T.S and SHAKE..SHAKE IT"
5,Readable Presentation,Found this book to be very informative on the importance of a Christian Worldview. Tom Neven does an excellent job presenting his arguments in a very readable manner. This book does a good job of sparking the reader's interest in defining your own worldview and comparing it to a Christian Worldview. Excellent book.
3,Too much,"This is an overly ambitious, overly preachy cd yet it has ""Beautiful Love"" which is a stunningly beautiful and wonderfully upbeat song."
3,Readable but disappointing,"The title of this book led me to expect an analysis of and lots of anecdotes about how artists, thinkers and scientists work out their ideas. And yes, that's what I got, but it just didn't go deeply enough for me. I had no ""aha"" moments reading this, and none of her anecdotes really reached me to get me excited. I think it's because of the plodding, quasi-academic tone of the book. It's well-organized but without any spark."
2,Blah,The clip in the back doesn't attach onto any of my belts. It hooks onto my alicepack but flops around annoyingly.
5,Good resource,My go to source when i need to substitute. When i choose to change my life style this book didn't exist. It is a good resource for information and recipes and substitutes.
3,"More jammng than ""song""","A shock after their latest, more song-based album, Microbe Hunters opens with one of the most direction-less, psychedelic jams the groop has ever made us endure. Once the vocals hit, in the following track, we are met with sentiments that reek of the worst Wobblies dreck. Suddenly, the disc turns back into Stereolab, or the Stereolab I've adored since Peng. The final track is worth every cent, being a masterful amalgamation of influence & innovation. As for the rest, it's growing on my gradually, much like most non-Stereolab pop I eventually cherish. Try Aluminum Tunes, if you're new to the groop."
4,A most excellent direction from Cobra and Phases!!!,"After the sort of ""uninspired"" direction from Cobra and Phases, this release takes it all back. Really don't know how, but it seems to interweave some of the best of Cobra and grab some of High Llamas soundin' stuff (of course) and throwing in a dash of the minimalist movement, a little of the song changes, and you've got a GREAT EP!!!! Highly recommended."
3,Worthy side-dish,"3 1/2Stereolab are more or less one of the rare types of indie bands whose entire catalog actually justifies seeking. Having said that, with the exception of one, possibly two songs, there is nothing the casual fan would miss out too much on- if anything a few overly-experimental concoctions could alienate non-fanatics from seeking so many solid full lengths."
2,For Stereolab Junkies Only,"Stereolab is very special, gorgeous, beautiful... However, this CD is not quite 'all that'. So, if you need to fill gaps in your Stereolab collection, look into one of their earlier works. Otherwise, add it to your collection just to have it available for special occasions."
5,"BEST THING S""LAB EVER DID: spacelab lullaby lounge music","perhaps greater songs scattered thruOUT there cosmosii but this is too perfect...especially songs 2-thru-6: the nuclear core of this incredible ep. too many bad reviews of this, too many crusty old lab fans (i WAS one)...but this slicks out past the future and the present...ya know, i think the best song ever done is certainly from COBRA: permutations........but this is the ep that interfaces with IT and makes the whole gel slide whole and edgy and groovy without nary a hipster in the room. if you are a hipster, you will painfully atomize. ""become one...hold your thoughts to the Present"".........ETC."
2,Havahart doggie door,"Our builder installed the medium doggie door with the plastic frame. This lasted 2 months before the frame cracked. I installed the medium doggie door with the aluminum frame. This lasted 3 months before the vinyl flap covering the door tore at the top. The flap is not replaceable, so the mfg sent me another doggie door. Also, the ""lock"" on the doggie door is a spring loaded pin which scratches the paint on the door in which it is mounted - very poor design. The product has a 12 month warranty after which I will shop for a more durable product."
2,A bit disappointed,"Unfortunately, I really felt I wasted some money on this book. It applied too many personal situations and I had expected advice on dealing with traveling spouses from reading the summary of the book. Overall, I found it to be helpful for those needing to compare their situation, but not helpful on giving many tips."
5,Wonderful!!!,Curtains were wonderful. They are of great quality and better priced than the ones I have seen at department stores. The material is thick and good quality.
3,"Thick material, decent quality","I was disappointed when I got these maybe because I've read the previous reviews. The fabric is thick but material looks kind of cheap. I did get two panes for $27 which is a great sale, so I guess you get what you pay for. One nice thing is that both sides of the curtain look good, so from the outside of the window looking in, the quality looks good. They do keep the room dark if that's what you're looking for. We have a thin curtain rod, so without the valance, I'd recommend at least having a thick curtain rod in black or dark brown to make it look good."
2,Conventional notions of male beauty,"The guys in this book are muscled, often faceless, and not yet middle-aged. Some of them have oiled skin, or are wet. This is doctrinaire stuff: fairly routine gay male erotica (albeit rated PG-13 - because detumescent.) There's a stultifying sensibility amidst the 'come-hither' poses and angles in use here. The Mapplethorpian conventions are all here: buttocks, genitals, abs, biceps, quads. No eye contact. I was bored, because I had hoped for interesting photography,and a sense of the human beings inside the bodies - and instead got a parade of 'perfect' physiques -in conventional poses."
4,Case Logic album,"THe recipient was thrilled he got a great gift that he really wanted, well in time and in perfect condition, thanks"
5,Love to Laugh,Jerry Clower makes me laugh. I love this CD. It gives me a pick me up sometimes when I am feeling a little down. Laughter is good medicine for what ails you. This is good clean comedy.
3,not up to the usual Martin Gardner quality,"Mathematical Circus: More Games, Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Other Mathematical Entertainments from Scientific American ; With Thoughts from Readers, AfandMathematical Magic Show: More Puzzles, Games, Diversions, Illusions and Other Mathematical Sleight-Of-Mind from Scientific Americanboth left me expecting more of this book.The main topic of this book is numberology and Dr. Matrix is a ""fly by night"" hero of the work.Gardner sort of singlehandedly gives numerology a stink it may never live down. The human trait of trying to see ""patterns"" in the world around themis carried to an obsession that is sociopathic that includes cabala and Mysticism.I would have given it a two star, but there are still vestiges of the old Gardner in the points on a sphere polygons toward the end.This book will make me look at all the Gardner books with a different eye."
5,How good this is,This Cd is one of the most best cds of all time. The Swedish Pop star is rocking my ears. I hope everyone else enjoys this cd. The songs are way to good.
2,Totally Invisible...,"i dont know how it got 5 stars and im not trying to discredit this artist but Way I Am is totally meaningless...the writing doesnt stand out at all and if u dont believe it check any song's lyrics. Ana got a record deal for being a pretty blonde that doesnt take off her clothes, anythg beside that is really ordinary...Words trying to Rhyme, dependant vocals and such a transparent music...ive heard this for like one week then left it out because honestly, there are lots of artists out there that actually deserve to be listened to, theyre not as pretty, not as famous but far better than this one.A"
3,Good supplement to official documentation,"This won't replace the official documentation -- especially since it covers an old outdated version of EXIM -- but covers enough to be worthwhile as a supplement. Still, I was rather disappointed that much of what I was trying to do (such as set up spam filtering) wasn't covered by the book, and that I had to go online and read through back mailing list archives and read official documentation to get the job done. From any other publisher I wouldn't feel too bad about that, but from O'Reilly I expect better."
4,Good book on a great program...,"If you can't (or won't) run sendmail, then IMO your only two real alternatives are postfix and Exim. I still believe that sendmail is a better choice, but both postfix and Exim are still quite good.If you decide to run Exim, there are few people who could give you a better insight into how the program is configured and how it works internally, than the author of the program -- Phil Hazel.However, keep in mind that the book is primarily oriented around version 3 of this program, and version 4 (with some significant changes) has already been produced. More information is available at [URL]."
2,M. T. Mig. PE,"This book was a disappointment. While first reading the book I thought it was great. However, after I tried actually configuring the exim program I realized this book included only superficial examples. Any serious configuration required an in-depth understanding of the exim program far beyond the overview of this book. The necessary bits of information are scattered throughout the book. Unfortunately, these bit were often not referenced in the Index. This required my reading large sections trying locate a specific bit of information. The book's index is weak. It often includes references to variables, options and features that requires the specific name of the information being sought to locate. In contrast Exim's downloadable pdf documentation has the advantage of being quickly computer searchable. After being frustrated with this book I turned to the downloadable documentation and found it much more useful."
2,These are junk,I paid 29.95 for mine. I was very disappointed in the poor quality..expecially given the price I paid. I'm sure there are better products out there. Don't waste your $$$.
5,This product has helped me achieve two goals.,"I bought this product from the following motivations: 1) It is now winter and I'm cold, and 2) my diet leaves a lot to be desired! ""Eater's Digest"" tea has been effective with: 1) staying warm, and 2) reducing digestive discomfort. It may have also motivated me to eat better; but I don't know how to gauge that result."
4,Soothing to your stomach,All Traditional Medicinals teas tend to be quality products. Eater's Digest in addition to having a clever title actually works. I use it for occasional relief of bloating or mild heartburn especially if I have eaten a little too much spicy food. It has a calming effect on my stomach. It takes about 5 to 10 minutes to brew depending on how strong you need it. Even though it has a pleasant taste on its own I like to add a little honey to enhance the favor. Highly recommended for occasional upset stomach.
1,A waste of my bowels time and money.,"By the time I realized that this tea did nothing but make me nauseated, it was 3 tea bags later. Do not waste your money on this product. The brand that has never failed me is Badia Slimming Tea. I did not purchase this product because i could not find it in New York City. stay away from Eaters Digest."
1,Not good,"The clasp on this leash does not work. It is difficult to open, and once you have managed to open it, it often times won't close."
2,Not something I would recommend,"This lead is not only very thin and lightweight material, but the width of only one half inch makes it difficult to manage in my hand. If you're working with a tiny dog - maybe it would be preferred, but I work with larger dogs and it's just too lightweight for my use."
2,This Web Lead did not last more than a month,"This training lead did not last a month. I use this for one of my dogs, in training to stay in the yard, and not chase critters. The lead was never left outdoors, and only used a couple times a day. It did get used in the rain, however. One day, I noticed that lead was divided in two..It had separated, and it seems the material just could not stand getting wet. I found this, and then attached the pieces together...However, two weeks later, the lead broke in another place...I tried to fix it, and it broke again. This was all while the dog was in the yard, being supervised. He did not chew it...It might have gotten tangled in a twig, but that is about all. I still have a another lead that I bought..Paid a bit more for it, and it is still intact after 6 months."
4,Soft on hands - Easily chewed,"This leash is soft on your hands, but .......At first I loved this leash, but then my puppy chewed on it. She isn't a big chewer - this is the first thing she has ever damaged. The leash is so soft and easy to rip that I now have to get a new one."
2,Four Paws cotton Lead,"The general quality is average. I wanted to use on them to restrain a dog inside the house. This wants to attack one of our other dogs. Without going into detail, a sturdy lead is a must. I can only speculate about the sturdiness but I was not impressed. My larger concern was with the sewing.The lead is very inexpensive and probably worth the money for small dogs. I already own two leads by [...] and decided to simply buy two more from them.If you have large dogs and strength is an issue, I would consider the ""fordogtrainers"" approach."
4,Nice Leash,Great leash for the price. I did not pay any mind to the size od the actual latch on the leash but it is quite large for smaller breed dogs. Leash is durable and strong. Would buy again.
4,Great training tool,"The 20-foot lead let me, a single person, train my dogs to ""recall""/come. I also use it to tie out my dogs when I'm weeding or pruning the front yard. (I DO NOT condone tying out dogs except for short periods of time, during which they are under constant supervision - as when they are supervising their guardian do benign yard work in an unfenced area.)"
4,"Work well with my Treo 650, I love it.!!!!","I got just few weeks ago,it is amaging. it works good my Treo 650, it is helping a lot my sales and my presentation."
1,Did not work with my Blackberry 8700c,After 16 hours and 3 computer teckies later could not get it to work other than my problem the laser keyboard is a great idea
5,Excellent,"This was a book on my son's reading list from school. It was difficult to find elsewhere. I went online entererd the title in the search. Amazon.com came up, among others. It cost less to buy it new at amazon.com. Some sites had it used, pages missing, etc for much more than I paid."
2,Too Dense!,"This book is very dense with information, which is good for someone with a working knowledge of music. It isn't, however, good for a beginner. It packs too much info into each chapter and mixes topics. For example if Chapter two is about harmonic minors it may mix in information about pentatonic scales. This is an over exaggeration, but the book is scattered like that. I think they need to simplify some more. And it is way too expensive."
5,A wonderful book from beginning to end,"I could not put this book down. From the very beginning of the book I was captivated by Susan's sudden revival after being in a coma. She's told that she was in an Oregan hospital after a car crash, or is she? Haunted by four people from the past, dreaming or was it real? I was mesmerized by the mystery and suspense. I would recommended this book to anyone. I loved the ending."
2,My Mind Was Hijacked By Russian Spies!,"One of Koontz's less-believable pieces, an early mind-control story that went overboard. Like most of his lesser books, this one starts out well but spirals downhill, until the shocking revelation is merely mundane - if you believe it, which you probably won't.This one comes off almost more as a soap opera spinoff than an espionage intriguer. It really just doesn't work. The characters aren't well-developed, the body of the novel is obviously padded.Anyone looking for bare-bones Koontz enjoyment after exhausting his many better titles may still enjoy House of Thunder. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone but hardcore Koontz fans, though."
2,One of his early ones and it shows,"I've read a number Koontz books, and liked a great deal of them, however... This book is poor. It trys to be shocking and suprising, but it just felt dated. Russians are just not scary anymore. If your a big Koontz fan I'd read the book just to get a taste of his early work, but I'f your new to his books get something new and much more up to date."
4,House of Thunder,"This book was first released in the early 80s under one of Koontz' pseudonyms. Susan wakes up in the hospital after a car accident. At first she can't remember anything about herself but her memory gradually returns. In the hospital, she starts to see what appears to be the ghosts of four fraternity boys who killed her boyfriend thirteen years ago. Are they really ghosts, or is she losing her sanity?The premise is a good one and it keeps you interested. But the buildup is a bit too long compared to the ending. She encounters her tormentors several times, but it never feels like there's any imminent threat to her until the last half of the book. About 100 pages before the ending, the story really takes off and it's a great read until the somewhat too abrupt ending.Not one of Koontz' best, but still definately an entertaining read. A weak 4 stars."
3,You never truly know whats going on,"This is a very interesting book to say the least. It's one that you never truly know whats going on. You may think you do but you really don't. At one point I thought I knew and I was close or partially right. Then when it was done I realized that is was so much larger than I had thought. If you like books that throws you curves all the time; ones that you never really on what's going on; ones that at the ending you have to laugh and go wow, I didn't quite see that comming than go get this book and enjoy."
4,House of Thunder,"Good, engaging plot. Easy read. Drew you back for more. For me, the conclusion wrapped up a little too fast. Will there be a part II? If yes, I will read it."
1,Shallow at a 4th grade reading level,"I have read a Dean Koontz book I liked, actually two and so I thought I would have some entertainment as I recovered from knee surgery, laying back and reading. What a simplistic, unsatisyfing book! The dialogue is like something generated by a computer program, the romance way too convenient and the suspense - gosh, turn on the lights, I am so scared. No. I wound up not caring what happened to the main character and her simplistic inner dialogue though now I am aware that I could end up in the hospital with a gorgeous,, single doctor giving me kisses as part of my treatment. This is absolute drivel. If you find yourself enjoying this you need to reach out and challenge yourself more."
4,a good read,"I thought this book was good, even though other reveiwers were dissatisfied with the ending. One just has to be a true dean koontz fan to understand this book (to all u first time readers I also recommend this to you to read:-)"
3,"A very scary page turner, until the end","I gave this book 3 stars because some of it is absolutely terrifying, I was actually afraid to turn the page a couple of times. It gave me chills! But...I only gave it 3 stars because of the ending. Much too unbelievable and disappointing after such a scary journey."
3,GRABBING...(when you start),"Wonderful book with a lot of frightening moments that had one of those endings that you totally don't expect, but when you get there, you realize it was a waste of time. The last 15 pages were absolutely horrible and very confusing. I could have done without it. READ ""HIDEAWAY"" AND ""INTENSITY"" FOR A REALLY GOOD TIME."
3,It was alright...,"I enjoyed reading the first 200 pages of this book. It started of very good and was very fast paced. Then 3/4 of the way through it took a turn for the worst. I forced myself to finish it,and I was glad that I did. The ending just seems a little far-fetched to me."
4,This book is about a lady in a coma trying to recover.,"This book opens when Susan Thorton has just awaken out of a coma. She is very disoriented and remembers very little about the 3 weeks before when she remembers the devasting car accident. She knows very little about her background or her life back home of the East Coast. The doctors don't have a clue either, or do they. That is the question you are trying to answer the whole novel as Susan tries to figure out the strangeness of small Wilawauk County Hospital. Basically, the plot of this book is very suspensful and flows well. The one minor thing is that the end unravel s so rapidly. This book is a very good suspensful thriller. I recommend this book to Dean Koontz and Stephen King fans alike. The plot keeps you turning the page and waiting for the end. The one minor flaw is that the end unravels so quickly."
4,What's with Koontz and Endings,"I have only read three Koontz novels, but I can still critique his work. This Book was great, until about three fourths of the way through it, when the fear that had building had the rug pulled out from under it. You were convinced the reasons for the strange happenings at the Hospital were supernatural, until he switches to a reality ending with really took away from the novel. It was a good twist, it just kinda stopped the suspense. Who cares what it is if it's not ghosts? But maybe you'll like it. Read it and find out yourself."
1,"The noise of the storm promised agreat read, did not deliver","Susan Thorton awakes in a hospital bed and is told she has been in a coma for a long time as a result of a car crash which she can't remember. In fact she can't remember anything about her life at all except what happened to her fiance a long long time ago in the cave system known as the House of Thunder. He was brutally murdered by four bigots who did not want him in their fraternity. Those four men are dead now, she knows this for a fact but she swears she is seeing them in the flesh as other patients and staff. She is also falling in love with her neuro-surgeon who has a few secrets of his own.This is not a fast paced thriller with most of the book set inside the hospital with Susan in the bed with the reader going into her confused mind. The House of Thunder picks up the pace at the end but the ending is too easy and not real exciting. There are a lot better Koontz novels out there than this one."
3,Good book up to the last 30 pages,"After reading ""Watchers"", which was quite possibly the most retarded literary effort in recorded human history, I was pleased with this book from the get-go. The fact is, the story is revealed piece by piece in a manner that does have you flipping the pages with zeal. Did I just use the word ""zeal""?Anyway, enjoyed this book up until the last 30 pages. After finishing the story I was like, ""Umm...okay. What was that all about? Was that a joke?"" It was as if Koontz just totally gave up at the end of the novel. Like he got sick of writing it and just threw in the towel. Extremely unfulfilling end, and I would have given this book 2 stars, however, since ""Watchers"" was so apallingly awful, by comparison this book is a 3-star-er."
5,"That's Thornton with an ""n""","To tell you the truth, I have not read The House of Thunder by Dean Koontz. I'm a big Koontz fan and have read several of his books. I'm putting The House of Thunder on my list of books to read. Why? Because my name is Susan Thornton-same as the main chartacter. In Koontz's book, he spells it Thorton. This is a common mis-spelling. In some book reviews(of this book) I find it spelled correctly, in some incorrectly. Thornton is an old English name that goes back several centuries. We have never met a Thornton that spells it without the ""n"". So, please remember the ""n"" in Thornton.Koontz books I have read, Demon Seed, Fear Nothing, Winter Moon, Tick Tock, Shattered, The Mask, The Vision, Lightening, and more. So I'm looking forward to reading The House of Thunder.(By the way when my husband played football in high school, his nickname was ""Thunder Thornton""-and I'm not kidding.)"
1,One of the worst books by Koontz,"I skipped through so many pages of this book because it was just terrible. Of course there is another goofy love story ""You're so gorgeous that I am in love with you"" storyline. And the conversations that these characters have are just bad esp the conversation between the orderlies. I have read some Koontz books and it seems that in every one of them some woman or women are degraded, tortured, or raped or all three. It was really difficult to finish this book. Even Koontz's The Key to Midnight was better than this and that was another bad read. Bottom line: this is probably one of the worst books written by Koontz or any author."
3,Not the Best of Koontz,"Koontz is among my favorite authors, but I must admit, I found this to be one of his weaker books. It starts out great, full of mystery, but it drags on a bit and I was disappointed with the ending. It was a decent read, but if you're new to Koontz, I'd recommend ""The Face,"" ""Odd Thomas"" or ""Intensity"" for a great story."
3,"Very creepy, too quiet","I found this to be another one of Koontz's terrific novels. I did not hate it (heavens, no!), but it was way too quiet. It wasn't as actively suspenseful as, for instance, Phantoms or Watchers, but it was definately creepy. The ending was very confusing, and I still am trying to figure it out. All in all, I was satisfied by it."
1,The Author Should Put On Hiking Boots,"It was obvious from the first trail we picked from this book that the author had not even viewed the trailhead from inside his car let alone set foot on the trails. Simple things like finding the trailhead were confusing, and downright wrong in some instances. Descriptions of trail landmarks and crossings were confusing, wrong, or nonexistant. This book is likely a compilation of very old trail descriptions that were not truthed now or in the first place. Best check in at the visitor center befor venturing off with ths unreliable trail guide."
2,Wouldn't Recommend,"Just returned from the Olympic Peninsula and found this guidebook to be less helpful than expected. Perhaps things have changed their since the 2002 publication so double check info on hikes before heading out. Had trouble finding trailheads for #61, specific distances would have been helpful in the ""Getting There"" section, wasted 1 hr and lots of gas trying to find #59 Big Flat,never found it. A confusing time trying to locate #35 Mount Angeles Saddle, trailhead signage doesn't include this name, located it nearly a mile in. Recommend a more current publication."
1,What planet does Seabury Blair live on?,"Although well written and generally humorous, the hikes described in this book are often not day hikes, or barely on this side of being day hikes. It seems Mr. Blair doesn't include looking at flowers, trees, animals, views, etc. on hikes, but instead sprints as fast as possible from point to point. A hike estimated at a ""conservative"" 7 hours took a triathlete and a disance runner NINE HOURS to complete. One hike he describes as a day hike (High Divide) is described in EVERY OTHER book as a 2-4 day hike. Fast and light is one thing, but Seabury Blair is living in a fantasy land. Be forewarned: unless you are a VERY strong hiker who doesn't enjoy hiking for reasons other than for a good workout, this book downplays the difficulty and potential seriousness of these hikes. I strongly suggest a book such as Wood's ""Olympic Mountains Trail Guide."" Don't waste your money on this one."
5,Best read,"Most hiking guides are pretty dry, but this one is entertaining and fun to read. It's only been on the shelf for about a week, which obviously is not enough time to take all 70 of the hikes listed in this book.But I have read about all of the hikes and the writing style of this book makes the "" talk"" almost as nice as the ""walk."" There's a trail for just about every taste and every ability, from beginner to hardcore hiker.A real plus are the maps. They are topos, so they show the kind of terrain you'll be hiking, and the trail and direction of travel is clearly shown. There's also an elevation profile for each hike.Another feature I liked are the little capsules of each hike, right at the top of the description, so you don't have to scour through a bunch of stuff to find out whether you'll like the hike.I've got all the Olympic Peninsula hiking books, but this is the best one I've seen so far."
1,Let down in the Olympics,"I had high hopes for this book but, suffice to say, it's no longer in my collection. I have no question but that the author knows his topic. However, like a previous reader, I found myself confused and even lost (at $3.00+ a gallon) trying to follow directions that are too vague and in one case really led me astray.If you want someone's opinion (and don't we all have one), this book is okay. But do yourself a favor and cross reference suggestions and particularly directions. Or, better yet, just find a better resource. Sure wish I had."
3,It made me feel old..,"Voice of Jason Alexander and Shelly Long.. Animation is simplistic and you can tell that budget was spent on voice talent. But, my 2 year old didn't care."
5,3 year old love this movie!,My 3 year old daughter absolutely loves this movie. She has watched it numerous times and continues to want to watch it even though Christmas is past. I watched it with her once and thought it was very cute.
3,"Rates this high because of ""O Christmas Tree""","These three features all are fairly well-animated and feature good acting and GREAT dialogue. Perplexing, though, is the plot writing, which is beyond terrible on the first two offerings (""Jingle Bells"" and ""We Wish You a Merry Christmas"") and just average on the third (""O Christmas Tree""). It's almost as if the person who wrote the dialogue didn't write the plots.This trio of releases put together make the package slightly more attractive, but not much because ""We Wish You a Merry Christmas"" with it's convoluted, meandering mess of a story would rate one star on its own, and ""Jingle Bells"" with its nonsensical plot devices (Selling the family horse only to have it magically reappear with no explanation as to why...total God in the Machine moment) would get just two.""O Christmas Tree"" actually is fairly impressive and would push four stars if released by itself."
3,My kids say...,"Review by brother and sister ages 6 and 8.""It could teach some people not to take on lots of debt and that you don't need to buy presents for your children, and that the best presents are the ones that you already have. But all the extra parts made it get ridiculous. It was especially really crazy when the toy horse turned into a live horse. The mom was silly and got the idea that she was a ""wicked witch"" mom. The dad didn't think things over enough, and it resulted in sadness."""
5,Brilliant!,"When you are an ordinary person, living a peaceful life in a small town, and suddenly find that an invading army has turned your church into a fort, there is no question that your life has been changed! When those strange soldiers move into your home, arrest your father as a traitor, and your mother starts to act crazy -- doing laundry over and over -- you know that life may never be the same again!This book is the true story of a Long Island family who became part of the Setauket Spy Ring, earning the gratitude of George Washington. Illustrated beautifully with watercolors, this simply written text would be entertaining to both children and adults.Maps and historical notes are included. Redcoats and Petticoats is a wonderful achievement."
3,Poor Quality Binding,This book was a very interesting story for children interested in the Revolutionary War. However the book's cover was put on upside down. I did not return it due to the cost but I was very disappointed at the lack of quality control.
1,Got gypped with this super glue!! 90% air,"I needed some super glue so I purchased this brand of super glue from my local grocery store. When I got home & opened it up, I kept squeezing & squeezing the tube & nothing was coming to the top but I could smell the super glue. Turns out that the tube of super glue only had about 10% in the tube if even that & was about 90% air!! I will never buy this brand of super glue again because this company is gypping me & everybody else who buys it. BAD BUY THIS WAS!!"
5,Act One a hit!,The book--one of my favs--arrived only a few days after my order was placed and in the pristine condition described. It was a gift so the spped and condition were much appreciated!
4,Moss Hart's Autobiography--good for book club.,"This book gives a fascinating look at the development of theatre in New York in the 20th century. The author is quite frank, critical of himself as well as other. His personal story is quite involving, and sure to provoke much conversation in one's book blub."
2,Riley's Opportunity squandered,"Tim Riley's book on Dylan starts fresh. He provides one of the best appreciations of Dylan's voice I have read. OK so the guy has a fresh point of view. Then he weighs into Dylan's early work with gusto. Riley appreciates Dylan's socio political protest in the image of Woodie Gutherie and also gets into what he imagines is drug fueled creativity up to 1966. He finds a drug behind every bush though which is possible but misses the multiple layering of Dylan's work. Then like the folkies who dis Dylan at Newport he starts to turn sour on Dylan during the post-66 period and gets nastier as the book moves on. Until finally in the Epilogue Riley becomes the master of mean invective against Dylan and everyone, except Wilco? Oh yeah, they are singing Woodie Gutherie songs to new tunes - right. There's the connection.My advice - borrow the book, read until Blood on the Tracks and quit. The rest will spoil your day."
2,Hard Read,"I found Mr. Riley's ""Tell Me Why"" a very entertinaing romp through the Beatle song catalog. Big an equally big Dylan fan, I expected the same joi de vivre to inhabit ""Hard Rain,"" but throughout the book I got the sense that Riley didn't have the same passion for or understanding of Dylan's music and muse as he did with the Beatles. I suspect that he wrote it because it seemed like a natural thematic sequel to the Beatle book. You don't need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows."
1,One star is to many,"This book is a waste of paper. You will find dylanoligy at it worst, hidden behind a small amount of credibility. ""Tell Me Why"" is a fine book (Riley's effort about the Beatles). Riley's commentary here is trite, Vision's of Johanna is not about Heroin, it's about the time I got loaded at my friends house and was thinking about my ex-girlfriend while making out with somebody else. Of course I'm not as old as the song but you should get the point. Dylan just writes 'em. You can not possible dissect Dylan's songs and pick only songs you like calling every thing after ""Blood"" trash ( that's not his words that's paraphrasing the last half on the book). Some things can not be defended ""Knocked and Loaded"" but if anybody else put out ""Oh Mercy"", Riley would have been singing their praises like he sings punk rocks in the last fifty pages of his book about Dylan."
5,Long-lasting food that my fish loves,"I only have a single cichlid, but he has thrived on this particular food for the past year and half now (I'm only just now ordering my next supply). Like the reviewer above, the food rarely makes it to the bottom. My fish gobbles it up the moment I drop it in the tank - and it does sink rather fast. I'm very happy with this product, and my cichlid has maintained his vibrant blue color since I have been feeding him this formula. Would highly recommend."
2,Fish didn't like,My fish (mainly cichlids) didn't like this product and most of it sank to the bottom of the tank without being eat. Very small pellets.Won't buy again.
4,Kid Rocks Talent Shows Again!,"I think kids under the age of 12 should get the edited version because it has some offensive language and content. Some people think that Kid Rock's new cd will be like Eminem's new cd, but they're wrong. Kid Rock in this cd is not as offensive as Eminem's cd. Besides those minor things get this cd! it is a great cd and I totally recommend this to everybody!"
2,The History of Rock [Edited],"Listened to the album and guess I am in the minority. Pretty good guitar, but he ain't no Hendrix or Clapton. by comparison to rock legends it's pretty shallow. Lyrics...edgy, but not very artistic. He likes swearing, which of course appeals to the young teens. There's no message anyone needs to hear. When someone needs to put a song called ""F**k That"" or ""F**k You Blind"" into an album, I guess he isn't Einstein. Finally, the vocals...could he ever do it without an echo? He has a vocal range of 4 notes. Still like the guitar though, but it needs more variety."
1,From The Remains of a Nostalgic Fan:,I wonder why Kid Rock never broke into the mainstream while Nirvana was still around. In about one or two years we'll be making fun of Kid Rock and his rap-metal carnival show just like we made fun of Vanilla Ice at the start of his demise.
5,The Best Kid Rock CD,This cd is very rocky and my favorite song is F**k That! Not a good cd if you dont like Blastin Hard Heavy Punky Rock! If you are letting your child get this in explicit lyrics you have made a stupid choice. If you get this cd enjoy it!
5,awesome cd,"good cd, love kid rock. Anything he does is superd and full of heart and soul ! Love his old and new stuff the same"
4,"exceptional, but devil without a cause was better","This album shows many talents of Kid Rock. I think that there are many good songs on this album, but really only one excellent song on it, that being American BadA**. I believe it is worth listening to the most, the second-best would be Early Mornin' Stoned Pimp. Sometimes I will listen to dark and grey or prodigal son, but overall, I think Kid Rock did a very good job, but he should include more hard rock in his songs."
3,Kinda...,"It's like ok, but I think it needs more melody... I do like it, but not that much. Guess this just ain't my kinda music."
1,Trash...,"An album of trash from a white-trash hick who ripped of Metallica, rapped so badly it should be illegal, had a midget as a sideshow freak of an MC, put Uncle Kracker on DJ(why?), and overall set back white people another 20 years.Now he's doign ""country"" but that's another story. Avoid this album like AIDS."
1,Sad but True,"I like how Kid Rock Rips of MetallicA on ""American Badass""..I think Kid Rock is a Top Notch Musician"
3,Not Bad,The cd's okay if you like Kid Rock's older music. This cd is his music before the cd Devil Without A Cause. But if you want his good music I suggest you get his older cd. My song reviews are below.2.American Bad A**- a good song if you like harder rock.3.Prodical Son- not a good song unless you like slow girly songs.4.Paid- okay5.Early Mornin' Stoned Pimp- one of my favorite songs although slow.6.Dark and Grey- perfect7.3 Sheets to the Wind(What's my Name?)- slower yet better.8.Abortion- don't bother listening to this song.9.I Wanna Go Back- SUX10.Ya' Keep On- Great.11.F**k That- Awsome song.12.Born 2 B A Hick- funny and awsome.13.My Oedipus Complex- hard and cool.
4,Not like Devil- but GREAT nonetheless!,"I first really tuned into Kid Rock when I heard Bawitaba, one of last summer's greatest songs. After I heard the song, I bought the CD and was really impressed. I just got the ""History of Rock"" today and it's truly a different flavor than Devil's but a great one. It has a lot of great old school guitar sounds and showcases the GREAT voice that Kid Rock has... who knew? If you are hoping for this to be another DWAC, let me tell you now that it won't be. It's a little softer. My favorite song is number 3. It's really phenominal and Kid's voice rocks. I really suggest trying the CD out. It's worth it."
4,Cool Side Of Kid Rock,"I absolutley loved the song American Badass (as well as the fact that it is Undertakers new theme). The rest of the album is re worked Kid Rock from his previous albums. I had never heard of them being a band wagon jumper with Devil Without a Cause. But I must say the funkier,Hip Hop side of Kid Rock is just as good as his hard rock/rappin side. I recommend this to all Kid Rock fans."
2,I'm a BIGGGG Kid Rock fan...BUT I was dissappointed!,"Being a HUGE Kid Rock I was delighted when I heard he had a new CD coming out. Like many other of his fans I waited and waited for the day it would be released. I even made sure I bought it the same day. I was saddened when I listened. The CD was totally NOT what I expected. I understood that he was going to have old songs on it but I also thought there would be a few new ones too. I was wrong. This CD is just a bunch of his old songs thrown onto a new CD except of coarse for American Bad A**. I don't know of too many women that would appreciate it either...all he sings about in most of his older songs is disrespecting women. It's pretty much a ""guy"" CD."
2,Absolutely Horrible!,"This album sucked. There's just no other way to put it. American badass is quite frankly the ONLY GOOD SONG on this whole track, and maybe Prodigal Son is OK at best. The rest is just garbage. ""devil Without a Cause"" was his best yet, and be satisfied with that because it's not getting any better than that. Don't be an idiot like me who actually bought this cd. Kid Rock's really let me down this time...."
4,"Not ""Devil"",But its real good!","This album is a far cry from ""Devil"" , but it rocks non the less.With Kid Rock taking us back to his roots, he proves why he has become the ""American Badass"" and should have been a force in the industry sooner.Take a listen, you won't be let down."
2,Not as hot as Devil without a cause and Cocky,"I have all three of Kid's albums and The history Of Rock isn't as good as the other two I'm afraid. Some of the songs are O.K. If I had to put the three albums in order of best to worst, History of Rock would come last and its a tie between cocky and Devil without a cause for the top spot. I don't know, maybe you'll like this album."
2,Horrible,"Kid Rock has no talent. Does everyone know that the ""awesome guitar riff"" from American Badass is actually a Metallica riff from 1991. Now metallica they are a real band, not this trash which will be forgotten and laughed at within a few years. So as you all can see, all Kid rock needed to do was use one metallica riff and they became world famous. The only thing which keeps me from giving this cd 1 star is Joe C. He was the man and let him rest in peace."
2,I'M SOOOOO SICK OF THIS GUY!,"Well ... the song ""American Badass"" is basically a line or two from every song on the ""Devil"" album, rehashed into a song that the fans will make a hit. I gave it 2 stars because he is still managing to string some of you along. I can't understand what the fuss is all about (get over the hype people). I guess he makes you guy's feel like rebels or something. Some of you may even live vicariously through the far-fetched description he creates of himself in his songs..."
1,Dont even think about buying it,"This is the worst cd that you could possibly think of. If you think this is devil without a cause 2, then your sadly wrong. This cd is more like vanilla ice then kid rock. There are only two new songs all the rest are off his old cds. There is only one good song on this cd and that makes it worth not buying. So whatever you do don't buy this buy the new eminem because that is so much better that the history of rock."
2,Not so Great,"Kid Rock's first cd was about a million times better than this one. The cd had about only two or three new songs and all the other ones were recorded before he was famous. Just wait for ""American Badass"" to come out on a single and save some money."
2,Not even close to his first one,"His first album is much better than this one. This one sounds like a collection of the rejects that weren't good enough for his real CD. The one cool song is American BadAss, with Metallica's Sad But True as the actual music. But other than that, I wish I hadn't spent my money on this one."
4,Tellin' it like it is,Kid Rock is dirty. True. He has poor manners. True. So what? Kid Rock tells it like it is. His songs are hardcore to the extreme and he really gets his point across. All his songs have a good beat and it is a very entertaining CD
1,Just No!,"This is probably thee worst album i own! Of all my 120+ cd's this is the worst. Kid Rock has taken some of his old songs and put them together on an album that is so bad that it hasnt gone back into my cd player since the day i bought it. ""American Bad Ass"" is a rip off a Metallica song from 1991, and the rest of the songs just suck. The only other good song on here is ""F**k That"" which was also on the Any Given Sunday movie soundtrack which was actually pretty good so if you want go buy that instead of this so atleast you'll get one Kid Rock song."
1,Awful in the extreme,"My utter contempt for this performer is difficult to express in words.The sampling of Metallica's ""Sad but True"" in one of his songs( I forget the name, but all of his songs sound the same) is just ..... Sampling takes NO talent, anyone can do that. He is just a talentless guy who swears alot.What talent.Profanity doesn't offend me, but it can become boring quickly. Please avoid kid rock (his name doesn't need to be in caps) and buy ""Master of Puppets"" by Metallica and/or ""Brave New World"" by Iron Maiden instead. MUCH more talent, folks."
1,"redneck rap or hickhop, whatever you want to call it.","I was never a fan of Kid Rock, but hearing him screw up Sad But True on American Badass, and seeing him screw up the kick @$$ lineup at Summer Sanitarium cemented my hatred of him. He is redneck rap, he a combination of country and rap. He crucified Sad But True, I will never be able to listen to that song without thinking of how this greaseball crucified it. His live show at Summer Sanitarium: the only redeeming part was the strippers, and when Kid Rock finally got off stage(why couldn't they leave the strippers out there the whole time?). Everyone there was booing him and throwing stuff at him. I honestly feel sorry for the securtiy guards at his shows who have to control thousands of drunk rednecks holding lighters. And I'm glad the midget is dead, it didn't serve any real purpose. We can only hope that Kid Rock's career is now ever. I'm done now, any more ripping on him would be a waste of my time and yours."
1,This album rocks? He-he-he...,"If this album rocks...A lot of people suppose Bud is ""The King of Beer"", though this drink is as similar to real beer as Kid Rock is similar to REAL rock musicians! -:)I guess his nickname is very good. ""Kid Of Rock""! He reminds me of small boy that belives if he says F** before and after every word he'll seem like adult man! -:)Can you imagine this ""rock star"" without EXPLICIT LYRICS?Can you imagine Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Bob Dylan, etc. ( even Black Sabbath!) didn't use EXPLICIT LYRICS and were REAL rock stars ( not kids)?One of previous reviewers said ""he can sing rap..."". He-he-he... Do you REALLY think you have to be musician and/or singer to ""sing"" rap? Do you REALLY think rap is music? If you do, well, ok, I'm sorry..."
1,Pathetic Horrible Disgusting Disgraceful trash,The loser can't write a song and stole a riff from one of the sickest metallica songs. I wrote this in hope it will lower the rating even lower. I could never stress how much i hate that loser. For this CD...he will burn.
1,UNORIGINAL THIEF!!!!!,"American Bad A** is the riffs and melody from Metallica's ""Sad but True""!!!!! Sorry, Kid Rock, but you are no where near what Metallica is to Metal/Hard Rock. I can't respect or indorse a CD when they copy my Favoirte band. Do NOT buy this garbage! Go pick up a Metallica album and see what real music sounds like!"
1,I threw it out the window of the truck.,"Really like the Kid, but this was just bad. Not one song would I want to hear again. I was really disappointed with this, just not sure what he was thinking. Oh well, just one of those things."
1,AAH,"You know this guy did appeal to me at first, but if you have this CD youve heard American Bad Ass, right? Listen to Metallicas ""Sad But True"". He ripped off the guitar part completely. H e tries to be metal, hardcore rap, and country at the same time. Fails miserably. He is a talentless wigger. Wait...thats too nice. I hope he commits suicide."
1,This CD is stupid.,"Do not buy this CD expecting Devil Without A Cause. I bought this CD and it is pure idiot rap. There's no monumental tracks like Bawitdaba, Only God Knows Why, Cowboy, or even Fist Of Rage for that matter. I would put the worst from ""Devil"" over the best from ""History"". Also the editing on ""American Bad..."" is horrible. There are tons of annoying beeps and loud noises in place of cursing. There's not really a good song besides Dark & Grey, and it's mediocre at best. If you like hiphop, you might think it's passable. But if not, don't even consider it."
1,What a disappointment!,"I am a huge Liam Neeson fan and waited MONTHS for a copy to be available. What a disappointment! Terrible script--it seemed unfinished; the story is depressing and frustrating. Make that ""ZERO"" stars! Sorry, Liam."
3,Not as good as the others,"Although the taste is great, it doesn't satisfy me as much as the chocolate milk shake. I don't mean the taste doesn't satisfy me, but it feels that the chocolate shakes are more filling. So, consider that before you purchase."
4,"Tastes good, controls hunger","It's not incredibly delicious and it's not going to keep you satisfied forever, but it does its job pretty good. My only complaint is that even if it says it can be stirred with a spoon, it takes a lot of stirring to dissolve and sometimes a significant amount of the powder ends up in the cup instead of in the milk. For the price, however, it is a very good product."
5,Slim-Fast Smoothies are Great!,"I use the Slim-Fast Optima chocolate royale and milk chocolate flavors to make ice-cold smoothies -- 1 c. skim milk, SF powder, a lot of crushed ice -- process in a smoothie maker or blender. The shakes help me get milk into my diet, satisfy my sweet tooth, get some protein, and resist high-calorie, high-fat ice cream treats. The flavor is great, and when prepared this way, the shake is thick and cold. I keep this product on-hand all the time."
3,"tastes sweet and yummy, but","the ingredients list shown here has the minerals listed first, not the ""real"" ingredients. On my container, the first thing listed under ingredients is SUGAR!!!!!! ARGH. Of course it tastes yummy:-) I'll be sticking with Kashi Vanilla and their much more wholesome ingredient list."
4,I used more milk,"Roughly 1 1/2 times as much milk. That worked for me.Of course, this product should be part of an overall strategy for losing weight - it isn't a solution. It should be part of a solution, and weight loss is a complicated process which is affected by many things."
2,"nasty taste,better to just eat fresh and healthy","I had high hopes for this product but was disappointed at the taste and the ""thinness"" of its taste. I thought that the protein level would be higher and in this way it would be healthier while limiting calories. Having to limit food intake to just on source does make it easy to diet but for me I needed a variety and some pleasure from chewing. Carrots looked really good to me in the end of the first week. I did manage to loose a pound but on week two I went on Weight Watchers and found it more filling and easy to follow and I lost mega pounds."
5,Its good,It tastes just like chocolate milk and its filling. I like to put bananas in it in a blender its awesome.
5,I like Slim-Fast,"I use this product every day, I use it in conjuction with ice and a bananna to make a very tasty drink thats very filling."
3,Good for price but better out there,"I bought this meal replacement looking for a way to lose weight. It doesn't have a whole lot of substance to it, I didn't minde the flavor ( french vanilla) Def a good buy for the price. I have had better success with another product, for anyone who looks to lose some wieght, I lost almost 18lb of fat in one cycle with this, I am lean guy, so 18lb was alot!Advocare 24 Day Challenge Weight Loss System"
2,Good Tasting But in 2 weeks you will hate it!,"It is good tasting and if you drink the shake at night, go to bed as fast as you can so you wont feel the hunger!!! After 2 weeks, maybe less, you will not even want to see the shake near you, because it really bores to have the same thing all the time!!!!"
4,Makes a Yummy Strawberry Shake,"We enjoy an afternoon cool down by blending Slim-Fast Strawberry Supreme with a cup of milk, fresh or frozen strawberries, ice and some Splenda to make a yummy shake."
5,Can't find locally,I really like the vanilla slim fast but for some reason it is never available locally. The chocolate isn't very good (IMHO) but I like the vanilla because you can add frozen fruit to make it whatever flavor you want. Good stuff!
5,great taste,"I like the flavor of this much better than the chocolate... plus, adding fruit and/or yogurt to the drink adds to the volume and helps fill me up so I'm not snacking on the stuff that I'm not supposed to be snacking on. I've added this directly to non-flavored yogurt, too. IMHO, it makes it easier to want to substitute this for the fattening snacks... almost like a dessert."
5,worth the price,"I used this product a couple years back when losing 60lbs. I used to make a serving of this in a water bottle at night before going to bed and then stick it in the fridge. When I got up in the morning, I'd drink it as my pre-workout fuel. I found that mixing it and letting it sit overnight in the fridge made it thick. I know there's a lot of complaints that it's thin, and that's true if you mix it and drink it right away. The trick is to have it mixed and refrigerated for at least a couple hours. Doing it this way made it extremely filling and provided lots of energy (and made it more tasty to boot!).Good use as a supplement, I recommend it (though, I wouldn't use it more than once a day but that's just my own personal preference)."
4,helpful,"This is what I needed to provide incentive. After 4 days, I am feeling wonderful. I will continue until I reach my goal."
2,Deliver us from evil,This book looked like someone just printed it off from home. I was not impressed. The price for the book was not worth it. I paid too much.
2,Just okay,This book was not as great as I had hoped it would be. The Demonologist is a much better reflection of the kind of work the Warrens did.
3,Audience-specific,"I had ordered this for my soccer-fanatic 11 year old son (who is half Dutch, so it's his cultural obligation!). We're all soccer fans, and I hoped it would be great family viewing. His review, however, was that it was 'kind of boring - probably better for Papa'. So if you're into soccer history and reliving the moments, go for it. But kids are probably more into the here and now of the sport."
2,Very little use on a trip to China,"I bought this book in preparation for a trip to China. It is very short on practical information, no Chinese script anywhere (therefore useless if you are trying to get somewhere independently), and actually pretty brief in the descriptions of the sights, too. The only thing that may have some value are the general sections about culture, religion, traditions, etc.. My 11-year old son read them (he found them a bit shallow). I guess if you are going on an organized tour and want to get an idea of what you will be seeing without taxing your brain this may be OK. If you want how-to information for independent travel, turn to Lonely Planet. If you want good, detailed information on the sights, get the French Hachette guides (not sure if they have been translated)."
3,Not new!,"I purchased this book new and there was a crease in the cover, as if the book had been opened a few times. The cover was also scuffed up. The book itself is excellent and has beautiful pictures."
1,VERY DISAPPOINTING,"This is one time I actually tried to take an open CD back to the store. I have actually seen BOTH of these performers together and greatly anticipated this release. But it was more like Gore and Bush than Peanut Butter and Jelly..... just going through the motions and with no substantive issues. See above where it says ""USED CD AVAILABLE""? THATS MY CD!!!"
5,"Simple songs, delivered brilliantly","Before I bought this CD I had never listened to Snow Patrol. It was just one of those ""I Believe They're Great"" things, based on what people told me.And Snow Patrol is great band with a promissing future.Their music is simple. Their lyrics are honest. They remind me of on of these bands that updated the Velvet Underground sound during the eighties, but yet they sound like no one else these days.And ""Velocity Girl"" is a great single."
4,"seba ""snow"" doh?","Ok. The title of this review is weird, but I can't help but think this band is the Irish version of the american Lou Barlow outfit ""Sebadoh"". Snow Patrol are awesome! I was going to buy this record a long time ago, after I read up on it a bit. I finally bought it used at a record store, and now I wish would have purchased it months ago. But the fact remains that I did buy it and now I'm better for it. Sweet, noisy, poppy, loud, soft, sad, melodic, I can go on forever, if I tried, if I tried. buy this now, or buy it used at a good record store, just hear it."
4,entertaining reading,"A few miscellaneous comments:--You might have to look up a few words. What? You didn't know that a ""livery"" was a chauffeur's uniform? If you are not experienced in sailing and canoeing, you might feel lost in one of the chapters.--Although the author's mother is nominally the main character in the second half of the book, the reader's attention is sometimes diverted by the father's domineering qualities.--If your own parents were tyrannical, you might find parts of the book unpleasant."
4,"Tradtional music, better than most, and a good bargain","Following vacations in French Polynesia and the Cook Islands, I bought quite a few CDs of South Pacific music to help me recall the sights and sounds of paradise. Over the ensuing years, I have gotten of rid most of the discs because they are either too modern and slick (Warning: watch out for ""Bimbo and His Royal Tahitians"" on Playa; they sound like a night club act), too heavily dominated by drums, or (in some cases) too amateurish. This CD has had good staying power because it sounds authentic but with just enough polish and has a good mix of styles and rhythms. I can imagine those palm trees and hips swaying!"
2,Why spend your money again?,This book is just like the one they publised last. There is no more than about a page of new source material.
4,Glue and string required -- just so you know!,"I guess I was spoiled by the wonderful boxes and stars and balls and all, but for some reason I was expecting these to follow her previous practice of assembling without recourse to glue and/or string. These, however, in the fashion of traditional kusudama, do require the inclusion of materials other than paper. I found this a bit disappointing...That said, the models are, as one has come to expect from Tomoko Fuse, lovely and interesting variations on traditional patterns and amazing innovations, and I recommend this book enthusiastically! If you understand in advance that this is not strictly modular origami like her other books, you'll be spared the modicum of disappointment I felt."
2,very average,i was curious about this film so i checked it out.and it was very Main-Stream.none of the shock jock stuff.a few things here&there but overall Howard played it way to safe&Conservative.
2,Uneven history of Howard Stearns' rise to fame.,"The final third of this movie is pretty funny. The first two thirds is, at best, uneven. The history of Stearns' rise is,, in and of itself, interesting given that he has, good or bad, changed radio. I rented the movie based on reviews in Amazon.com -- I just did not see it the way most others did."
1,Just Not My Thing...,"I bought this at the request of a friend, knowing I wasn't fond of Mr. Stern. What I didn't expect was the friend asking me to please watch it with him. So, I did. It's typical self indulgent, I'll be a bad boy if I want to, nyah nyah Howard Stern stuff. If that's your thing, then you'll probably like it. Since it's NOT my thing....well, you get the picture."
2,alright,some really funny moments are in this movie for example see the scene with the puppets which is in about the first half hour of the movie.i cant see why this movie won so many awards.some people could like it because of lots of unnecesary nudity
3,Great movie deserves a great DVD,"This is one of my favorite movies, but they could do SO much more with the DVD. How about a commentary track by Betty Thomas or, even better, the Stern show crew? They could also incude some clips from radio bits Howard's done in the past. There is really limitless potential for this DVD, but it falls WAY short."
3,"""Can I Tell You Something""","'Private Parts' is a surprisingly enjoyable film based on the life and career of radio talk show host and innovator Howard Stern. It's everything you'd expect it to be; overtly sexual, irreverant, crude and definitely not for children. It is also quite funny and insightful showing that Howard can laugh at himself and wonder in disbelief at his meteoric rise to fame on the American airwaves. This film was particularily surprising to me since I've never been one of his fans.Definitely not for everyone, but remarkably good especially considering the subject matter."
4,heartwarming and funny in one movie,"the king of all media tries to cover all the bases in this film and pretty much gets it done. from the movie, you can tell how much he lives his wife and how he knows that SHE is the true purveyor of his success. then on the comedic side are the on-air bits in the movie that are some of the funniest moments on screen in recent time. heartwarming, engaging, and entertaining, stern shines in his film debut with a charming tale of how he made it to the top."
5,Surprisingly Great,"I rented this film just to get an insight on what drove Howard to be the man he is today, expecting nothing more but a couple of laughs here and there. But what I got was a above anything I ever expected. It's non-stop comedy from start to finish and in the end your asking for more of Stern."
2,LOVE THIS MOVIE....DVD bites!,"One of the great films of the 90s brings what all Stern fans know already - that he's a great person, humanitarian and funny as hell - into the general public's eye. That said, stick with the HBO or USA showings or buy it on VHS. The DVD has nothing else to offer - no extras (and this movie could have TONS of extras). ..."
3,"Good movie about Stern, but can be totally gross.","Is not for teenagers. I'm 25 and I was still kinda disgusted. ""Privart Parts"" is a good DOCUMENTARY, but Howard Stern is really revolting. I can't believe some of the things he did in ""Private Parts"", but, then again, I can't believe ANYTHING he ever does anyway. Should've been X, but can be truly hilarious!!! Not appropriate for anyone under 20."
4,Lesbians equal ratings,"No question, Howard Stern has had an interesting and illustrious career. I suppose it was a good idea for him to make this movie when he did - and it was done well by Ivan Reitman. The movie has a good feeling to it and it has some very funny moments, but there's not much to it beyond the story we'd already known about Howard - as revealed over the years on his radio show.It's entertaining - and I especially like the parts where Howard plays himself as a college student. Keeping things so so tame may have hurt the story somewhat, but the success of the movie speaks for itself.Oh, as an aside, this DVD has one of the gayest photos I've ever seen on the cover."
5,great,"Fast and easy. movie was brand new just like they said it was, still wrapped. only problem it seemed like the shipping to long, but that is the post office for you."
1,Incredible delirious,"This guy can't write books, has a garbage mouth on TV, radio he is nothing but rude, and now a movie that is worse than all the rest [well almost all the rest]. He better hope he doesn't lose his cult following, otherwise he'd be out of business, what can he do...the movie's a sham. He should learn how to do something positive, instead of self glorification."
1,I just don't get it,"I decided to watch this movie because my wife as well as my best friend from college are both Stern fans, and have often told me how I fail to understand him as he truly is. Well. after watching this bilge, I can honestly say I truly understand Howard. He is a dorky loser who learned early on that developing a potty mouth would get him attention. He married a woman who was way too good for him (something she apparently finally realized)and dragged her through the mud till she got sick of it and dumped his sorry carcass. He persists to this day saying purile clap trap that only appeals to children in adult bodies, not to adults. The most laughable part of this whole sorry tragedy is the praise he receives for ""having the courage to speak his mind."" Well, when your mind consists of half a dozen curse words and a neurotic need for attention, it doesn't take long for it to speak all it has to say. This movie is pathetic schlock for losers."
5,Funniest man alive! perhaps ever!,"Howard Stern enough said...funniest man ever. He's not all about ""lift up your top"" as most people think. If you or anyone else talked about people and current events 4 hours a day for 35 years you'd offend alot of people too."
5,Loved it!,If you love the Howard Stern show you will love this book. If you don't like the Howard Stern show you will love this book. It's a facinating story about one of the most influencial radio personalities in history.
5,A MUST FOR ALL STERN FANS AND FOES,"Whether you love or hate Howard (I love the show ) this movie will leave you throughly entertained . Look for a brief cameo by the late great Jackie the Jokeman Martling , who also appeared in Apocolypse Now and won an Oscar for his work in Schindler's List ."
5,I thought it was great and howard is so sexy.,"I thought Howard Stern's private parts was the best movie I've ever seen! It was funny and sexy. Howard has one of the nicest bodies I've seen in a long time. And I see a lot of bodies, too! My dream would be to meet him or even see him in real life!!! It was definately worth seeing! I've seen ot 3 times already! Go see it!"
4,An Intriguing And Exciting Mystery,"This review concerns the original 1951 edition. Nancy is approached by a young college professor who tells her about a treasure that he and some other professors were searching for in Mexico. They had found a stone tablet which they believed would help them locate the treasure, but before they could translate it, the tablet vanished along with one of the professors. Did he steal the tablet or was he kidnapped? Nancy is asked to help find the missing professor and the tablet and to guard a valuable, black, half key which together with another 2 1/2 similar keys would unlock the treasure. This is probably one of the 10 best Nancy Drew books. The mystery, though a little implausible, is quite interesting. The book has a lot of action and suspence and was well-written. I was hooked from beginning to end. This is a very good book and every Nancy Drew fan should have this one in their collection."
4,The Clue of the Black Keys,"Is it a good book? I say yes because once again Carolyn Keene manages to stump her readers. You start to wondering: where is doctor pit, what happened to the keys, and how will the atractive blond Nancy Drew solve the mystery? The only way you can find out is by reading The Clue of the Black Keys."
5,Perfect,Got it for my sister's doggie and it is the same one that she has looked and looked for in the stores.
2,Sub par performance,I wanted a backup battery for my Nikon D40 when I traveled to Russia. I planned on taking tons of photos and didn't want to get caught with a depleted battery when I was shooting. I purchased this battery before my May 2007 trip and it worked ok for about three charges... then died. It simply does not take a charge any more - and though inexpensive - I expected more than three uses. Buy another brand... Lenmar is a dud.
4,Awesome study tool!,"For my International Baccalaureate high school degree, I had to read King Henry IV for my English class. At first, I couldn't make head or tail of what was happening, but after buying this book all the meanings and symbolism came to me. I began to enjoy King Henry IV, and enjoyed it so much that I even went on to read The Merchant of Venice!This book provides the play script in Shakespearean english, but provides a running dictionary beside the text in order to provide the meanings of all those old words and phrases. At the end of each scene, a summary of the plot, its importance, and a general commentary is provided. The easy to read text is a bonus."
3,Maybe good,This is my second bottle that I bought. I have a ligament that is strained. After two bottles it didn't seem to help. Maybe after using it longer it might work. I did not seem enough of a change to keep using it. I would like to hear of some people who this has helped.
5,I love this book,"I read this book one chapter a day to get me focused on my own writing and reading for my dissertation. This book brings my soul to where I am. Without this book, I don't know how to get rid of my other worries in life and concentrate on my study. So I strongly recommend this book to others who need some comfort concentrating on what they are doing."
2,The Sound of Paper - Nothing New Here,"For anyone who has read The Artist's Way, The Sound of Paper will simply be a reiteration of Cameron's philosophy on the writing life and how to unblock, using the same concepts put forth in her earlier work. The text is well-written, albeit there is absolutely nothing new here; as in The Artist's Way Cameron continually pats herself on the back and drops names. The Sound of Paper should be renamed 'The Sound of Money' as it is definitely funding the author's less lucrative creative projects by tapping into her cash cow."
2,Weak album from the early 90s period.,"Tangerine Dream's strength lies -IMHO- in the interaction between the various band members and the compromise that results. Jerome Froese (son of Edgar Froese, founder and still member of the band), being new to the band, wasn't enough of a force to ""oppose"" to Edgar's direction, and the result is clearly Edgar being the primary contributor to this album.Due to this, ""Rockoon"" is a somewhat weak album, with few memorable moments - it tries (IMHO, unsuccesfully) to have a rockish feel, but doesn't quite achieve it.Compared to other albums with the same lineup (""Turn of the Tides"" and ""Tyranny of Beauty"") this album comes somewhat behind. I'd recommend buying TotT and ToB first, THEN come back to check out Rockoon."
5,My first Tangerine Dream CD.,"This was the CD that got me hooked on Tangerine Dream about eight years ago. One of the first albums by the line-up of Edgar and Jerome, this CD has more of a jazz-like feel to it than most of TD's earlier albums. The mix of songs and the instrumentation is varied and upbeat. The use of guitar, both electric and 12 string, saxophone, and synthesizer works very well. Songs like Touchwood and Spanish Love stand out, and are balanced very well with Penguin Reference and Lifted Veil.If you've avoided TD because some of their albums may be too ""ethereal"", give this one a try."
2,Great but not great at the same time.,Good movie but I didn't want to hear Mr. Coppola talk through out the movie. I had to buy a different version.
1,This is definate trash!,"I hate the music partially because of the raging guitars and such but mostly because of the horribly written lyrics, do not buy it!"
4,"Robert Culp was ""HOT"" in this Western","The brothers (played by Strother Martin, Ernest Borgnine, Jack Elam)as mentioned in other reviews, are ""slap stick"" at times. Welch's make-up was too heavy for the time period, and her dress un-buttoned down her navel while she is cooking, was a bit much. With all that it is still a very good movie and Robert Culp's best acting. He could teach me to shoot a gun anytime!One of the better Welch movies, I have this on VHS and have watched it over and over!"
4,BETTER THAN I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE,"I liked this film because it was just plane Western and boy was Raquel Welch looking beautiful as she is today. Although it just went straightforward, from the gang rape to shooting all of them, but I liked it because they all gave good performance and the sountrack is wow, like excellent(I loved it and if only it was still on CD or something)"
2,Caulder offers nothing new and a lot old,"To put it nicely, Hannie Caulder is an homage masquerading as a western. It offers nothing new and a lot old. Below its thin veneer of a plot(Raquel Welch's quest for revenge against the men who brutally raped her)you'll easily see several rip-offs of prior westerns. The Mexican soliders chasing the outlaws is obviously from Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, and the three-against-twenty gunfight with Hannie, Thomas, and Bailey is reminicent of that in Magnificent Seven. Throw in the mysterious, man-in-black (a.k.a., The Man With No Name from the Sergio Leone spaghetti westerns)and you have a hollow story that relies on the usual shoot'em-up plot devices. The only difference--and it's a noticable one in Raquel Welch--is that a woman wears the ten-gallon hat and six-shooter. Too bad she couldn't inject a fresh, feminine perspective on violence instead of offering the same old macho mimicry."
1,Reel Garbage,"These film companies are getting cheaper and cheaper. Blu-Ray and no subtitles OR sound. Very bloody, the crappy red blood that doesn't look like real blood. A goood cast wasted on a crappy predictable movie. I sure could have done without this one. I'm going to have to start reading the bottom revues first, the ones where the truth lies."
2,western,I saw this classic many years ago. but after seen it again. I was not too impressed. I give it an o.k.
3,Good lecturer but not rigorous enough,I had considered becoming a biology major earlier in my college career and picked up this resource because I had success with Thinkwell Calculus in the past. I did enjoy the lectures but found that it was not rigorous enough for my intro bio classes. I wish there were more application exercises for the DNA and genetics/probability stuff...my classes went way more in-depth than what was presented here. I found this to be more like high school biology than university level biology in the amount of depth and rigor covered.
4,Welcome to the City,"In a previous book in this excellent procedural series, Detective Bert Kling lost his girl to a gunman. In this entry, he still is dealing with his grief and his attitude has him close to being transferred. In an effort to help his friend, Steve Carella volunteers to work with Kling on the case of a murdered model. Because of friction, Carella is taken (presumed dead) by a mystery woman who begins to hook him on heroin. This is a fine entry in the series, but I prefer those that focus on several cases and feature more of the 'gang'. But, hey, any McBain is hands down better than any procedural by anyone else!"
4,ONE OF THE BETTER MCBAINS!!!,"Tina Sachs has been killed. Who would do this to a pretty model? Carella is assigned to the case and asked for Kling who is mad at the world over the killing of his girl friend in a previous book. Carella finds out who the killer is and goes to arrest him. Instead he is taken prisoner and put through much punishment and herion shots. Who is the strange girl who keeps bringing Carella food and also giving him the shots? Kling is taken off the case and Myers is given command. They do find tthe killer but is it in time to keep Carella from becoming addicted? This is much better than book nineteen. At least this one involves some police work. I would have given it a five except for several pages of how a doctor treated Tinka Sachs for her drug addiction. I don't think it had anything to do with the case. You knew,in your mind, that Carella had to live to be in the next book but it did hold my attention and I did not want to quit reading."
4,It was absoloutly riveting.,"DOLL, by Ed McBain, is by far his best work that I have read so far. It left you guessing throughout the entire book. You never know who the killer is despite the fact that he has Carella locked up in his apartment. Also, McBain leaves you guessing as to the motive of the killer until the thrilling climax in which all is revealed. Man, you want to talk about nail-biting. The author also does a terrific job of illustrating both the inner and outer conflicts of Bert Kling, who is openly hostile after his girlfriend was gunned down (that incident doesn't occur in this book). I say again, DOLL is one of Ed McBain's finest works. Once you pick it up, you won't put it down until you're finished."
2,"Great Book, Ghastly Paper","Since when is beautiful art presented on crappy, low-grade glossy paper. These artists are incredible and deserve so much better than this stock chinese manure. It's like listening to Beethoven on a 1990's era cell phone. And sadly, the great Doug Chiang had departed the ranks of Lucasfilm by Episode III."
4,Ah...Those were the days!!,"This is an album that never tried to take itself too seriously and neither should it's audience. What it does do, at least for me, is take me back to my early college days like no other album. The great thing about this album is it was never overplayed on the radio and just lived on in peoples scattered cassette collection. I am glad that this album was still available. I had lost any trace of my worn-out cassette. ""Valerie Loves Me"" still gives me chills from that simple guitar riff and immediately sends me back to '91 sitting in my car, still buzzed and not yet wanting to go inside until I heard the song one more time. I reccomend this album to any late twenty-something and to anyone who just wants a fun,simple album to attatch to."
3,LISTEN FOR YOURSELVES for your best review.,"When people say an album (or movie or tv show, etc...) is bad and they do NOT explain why they think it is, then you know that they either don't know what they're talking about, they just like to talk bad about good things, or they just don't get it. When everyone else and myself all agree that this is a solid pop/rock album, then you know the people described above have their comments deflated. Is the album good? Yes. Very good. Is it the greatest thing since sliced bread, maybe not.Here's the greatest advice to everyone looking to find out if an album is great or not. CLICK ON THE SONG SAMPLES and listen for yourself! Don't let anyone tell you it's great or it stinks. If you like what you hear, then it is good. It's as simple as that. Enjoy."
2,Monotonous and Unmemorable,"You'd better be sure you really, really like Material Issue's sound before you buy this CD -- because that one sound is all they've got. No song distinguishes itself from the previous or the next. They basically all sound the same. Simple melodies, simple pop guitars that sometimes are catchy but many times are just mediocre, a lead guy who can't really sing but tries hard...and that's about it.The Amazon review says it well. Somewhat likeable, but definitely NOT loveable."
5,Are you a fan of music? Then buy this immediately!,"Forget everything you are doing and buy this now! It's the debut CD from a band that should've been the next big thing. The songs are so well written. It's perhaps ""the"" definitive power-pop CD. You want to hear some perfect pop songs? Check out ""Valerie Loves Me"", ""Diane"", ""Lil' Christine"", ""Very first Lie"", ""Renee remains the Same"", and ""This Letter"". I'll never forget playing this CD at my friends house, and his Dad asking if it was the Beatles. I wish they would've captured a little more of their live ""punkier"" sound on this CD, but it's still a work of art."
3,"WARNING -This Is A ""Guilty Pleasure Flick""","Yes, it's 60's exploitation tripe. No, you would'nt watch it with your mother or children. But you WOULD watch it, and get a kick out of it's over-the-top, leering tawdriness. Get a six-pack and some peanuts and let'r rip!"
3,overall this is,"worth seeing, if not owning. Fair to hideous acting (Hall gets really tiresome after a while, both female roles make Tor Johnson look like Olivier), amazing cinematography, semi-obvious plot (some things are true surprises, though), and TERRIBLE ending. Buy it, but at a discount"
1,DETENTION,Dreadful. A teenage couple terrorize some teachers on their way to a Dodgers' game & later two highway patrolmen at a deserted wrecking yard where they have also killed the owners. Writer-director James Laudis' script though over loaded with exposition is serviceable enough. Unfortunately his direction is so slack & the performances of his cast even slacker that the whole thing seems like an exercise in bad timing. The editing & William Zsigmond's (any relation to Vilmos?) beautiful black & white cinematography provide some much needed juice.
5,Great great picture,"The sadist realy surpriced me when I saw itm, kinda like how Night of the living dead surpriced me when I first saw it. Both films are well made even if the have a realy low budget and both don't stick to movie formulas and cliches. Only thing wrong with it is the crappy tag line: Before there was Jason, before there was Freddy there was the Sadist, pretty lame and the other thing is a very B-movie prologue. Other than that I give this flick a full house."
3,Not the ending I remember!,"I first saw this movie in the early 1970's on late night TV. I never forgot the ending of the original. Just as you thought the girl had gotten free of the sadist, she looks over next to her in the old truck and there is a rattlesnake on the seat ready to strike her. The latest version shows her getting away unscathed. The new version is pretty good, but the original, really was more emotional and memorable.Three stars for the new version. Five stars for the original."
4,A surprise from the star of Eegah!,"If you only know Arch Hall Jr from his MST3K fodder, like Eegah, you ought to give this little drive-in shocker a try. Taut atmosphere, shoestring budget, and Hall's freakish performance as a leering white trash killer really make this live in your memory. I hate the leading man, and Marilyn Manning is just weird here, but Hall and the direction overcome the cheese factor."
4,What a difference a film makes,"Arch Hall jr. and Marilyn Manning can act? Based on Eegah, who knew? Mind blowing that this was screened in 1963. Three school teachers on their way to a Dodgers game break down in a seemingly abandoned junkyard, only to be held hostage and systematically psychologically tortured by a vicious teenage couple, played by Hall and Manning. And yeah, they carry the parts well. The cinematography is great, and so is the pacing. The film never relents as the situation just gets worse and worse for our victims, and the ending is as twisted as the 85 minutes before it. No spoilers here, folks, as you deserve to see the film cold as I did. And see it you should! It's available on one of the Mill Creek Horror Classics packages, but a better buy is the single disc remastered version with tons of extras. Mine's already on order. Heavily recommended."
5,Original Fan,"I saw the Sadist at a drive-in when I was a senior in high school in Texas. We all went back the next night to see it again. The only other movie that I saw again that quickly was Bonnie and Clyde. It has the best ending of any shocker ever made. It is a much-overlooked American classic. There have even been pop songs written that are based on the dialogue - ""Judy, bring me a sodee!"" This DVD will be a permanent part of my collection (along with every Steve McQueen film available and One Eyed Jacks.)"
5,Great Relaxing Music,"I've loved this music for years. I had the Cassette about 10 years ago, but lost it in a move. I was thrilled to find this music on DVD.This is great background music to work by, drive by, or write by. I listened to it while driving threw my home town after being away for 10 years. I listened to the music months later and was taken back to that moving home town reunion.My recommendation, buy this album, and when you get it, put on the music and write an old friend a letter."
1,Superficial,"This book covers a wide range of topics, but it does not go into detail in explaing them. The treatment of grammatical structures, especially tenses and conditionals, is broad but superficial, leaving out important cases, thus making the book of limited value for advanced students who require clarification of grammatical nuances, not a survey of topics. It is more suitable as an introductory text for beginning ESL students, as a foundation for further study."
1,Poor choice for my advanced grammar students,"I used this book in my Advanced Grammar and Writing course, and I was very disappointed. I especially disliked the practice exercises. They often included complicated structures that were irrelevant to the topic being practiced and that tended to distract students from the issue at hand. Also, the book seems quite out of date, and this affects the types of practice activities included."
1,Don't waste your time on this book!!!,"It's not helpful at all...lots of topics with so short details.When you read it,you're gonna have more questions long the way."
3,"Very good album, but more of a collectable.","This album is very entertaining to listen to, if you have something else you're doing. Unless you are getting high and want some music to accompany you, this isn't the best album to concentrate on. If you are listening to this album, I suggest you have something else to do. Treat it as background music."
3,Only for extreme Pink Floyd fans,"This album is extremely rare, it will be a good adition to those who like me collect anything they can find done by the best band on earth. The songs on it are no exactly Pink Floyd's best but if you are a collector this is a must.Ronald Recinos"
1,WARNING - Product Shorted USB Ports on first day,I have used a GE USB Optical Mouse for 1 year. I decided to try this iogear mouse as a back-up. Everything worked great for the first 15 minutes. I then walked away from my laptop and left it sitting there for about 30 minutes. When I came back and touched the mouse there was a spark in the USB port area. I am ESD (electro-static discharge) trained for my work and I know that I did not cause this shock. The USB ports still send power through but DO NOT register any devices plugged into them. I am going to trouble shoot the issue AND contact IOGEAR but I suggest no one else purchase this product. USB Ports on a laptop are not easily fixed (and what is the use of a laptop without USB!!!)
1,"took it daily, for two months. DIDN'T WORK!","This stuff had no effect on me. I followed directions and everything. I waited, zero effect.But i just tried these pills called (sam-e) its at walmart or any local store.I took it for two weeks, and i saw major improvement!The only con is that there a little pricey."
5,delicious,"I got one of these for my bridal shower three years ago and am completely addicted: the Rodolfo scent is both sensual and clean (tuberose, I think), very therapeutic, and keeps my bedroom smelling fresh and enticing."
1,Very Upset About Shipping,"I ordered a candle from this company through Amazon and I got a notice that it shipped Fed Ex yesterday. When I went to track the package, I was shocked to see that the expected delivery date is TWO WEEKS from today. I contacted Fed Ex and they said some shipping method was used that means, basically, Fed Ex just kinda takes their time getting it to my local POST OFFICE. Then, the mailman will deliver it. Not Fed Ex. This makes no sense. I paid enough for shipping that they could have simply sent the candle via the postal service and it would have been here w/in a few days. I'm VERY upset about this. Two weeks to get anything delivered by any company is completely ridiculous. I've been ordering things online for years, and have never, EVER come across something like this. I won't be ordering from this company again."
2,Not what I was expecting,"I checked this book out of the library, hoping, like many other people, that it would be of the same caliber as the Bridget Jones novels. I was extremely diappointed. The character of Olivia Joules is like cardboard, a cheap imitation of BJ. While there were some funny moments, I found the entire story line way too implausable, and a plot that seemed like it should have been in the movies. I felt as though Helen Fielding catered entirely too much to the Al Queda theme which has appeared lately in fiction and movies. In this, she looses her originality."
3,Some Fun Moments But...,"Yes I too am a Bridget Jones junkie, like many of the other reviewers on this site. I too was disappointed in the book. It is not just that the character was not like Bridget Jones--but the plot, the pacing, the other characters, all seemed off.HOWEVER, there are plenty of reasons to read this book on the beach this summer. Fielding creates a fun atmosphere as her heroine tries to become a ""Jane Bond"" and track down the man she believes is an Al Qaeda operative--and on whom she has a very big crush. Olivia dashes from Miami to LA to Egypt to just about everywhere in the world in a very short time and manages to meet everyone from gun wielding kidnappers to Brad Pitt. It's a wacky, fast paced read."
2,Scattered,"I usually like this type of book for summer reading, but I was disappointed in this latest book from Helen Fielding. I found the book to be scattered and hard to follow. I was skeptical at the spy-skills that Olivia suddenly possessed. The characters are not developed, and the plot was not cohesive. Not an enjoyable read."
2,I'd still be interested in a sequel...,"Like other reviewers, I really wanted to like this book. I did like parts of it, but overall I was disappointed. I don't like to read about real life tragedies in my light reading. I think it is inappropriate. References to Sept. 11, 2001, do not belong in a fun reading book. Neither do real life terrorists and their organizations. As for the book's overall concept, I still think it's sound. I like the idea of a ""female James Bond"" and Helen Fielding is the perfect writer to bring her to life. I hope that she is able to write a few sequels, hone her idea a bit. Make Olivia a little bit tougher, a lot less ditzy, and give her some of that old Bond pizazz."
1,"Love Helen, Hate this Book","Like the other reviewer, I really wanted to like this book. I was SO EXCITED when I heard that Helen Fielding was coming out with a new book. It turned me off right away with some reference to a dangerous terrorist being attractive or exciting. I was thinking, maybe this is a British thing I just don't get? I gave her a chance and actually read the book all the way through. It might not be the worst book I ever read, but I didn't enjoy it at all. The action and plot were so simple it was offensive, and the characters were empty and just plain stupid. Not at all what I expected from this author. Please don't hold it against her, though. Skip this book, but read Cause Celeb and Bridget Jones Diary."
1,Racist and ignorant rubbish!,I was actually a fan of Fielding before reading this book. Enjoyed her others! I found this book to be offensive. Either Fielding is racist and ignorant toward Muslim people or she wanted her main character to appear that way. It was clear that this book was written in hurry with little attention to character or plot details.
1,Pitiful encouraging of stereotypes and racism,"I read Bridget Jones several times so I was really excited when I finally got this book from the library (good thing I didn't have to pay for it). In the beginning, the book was ok, not Bridget Jones quality, but readable. I kept waiting for the whole Al Qaeda plot to really be a figure of Olivia's ""overactive imagination."" Unfortunately, this did not happen. The lesson learned from the book is that if you see an Arab, he must be a terrorist plotting a disastrous strike on the U.S. and therefore you must call the FBI immediately. This book encourages fear, stereotypes and prejudice against Arabs, something which this country does NOT need. I am extremely disappointed, offended, and will not continue to support Helen Fielding."
2,"A Big, Big Letdown",I was so excited when i found out that helen feilding the writer of Bridget Jones' Diary had a new book out. I loved Bridget Jones but I could find no reason to love Olivia Joules. The plot of this book is not very good i tries so hard to be outrageously funny that it misses. Basically Don't waste your time.
2,Fielding needs to stay out of the spy thriller genre,"This is poorly done. It is so implausible and her facts are way off. I find it ridiculous that a US Navy carrier has no combat air patrol up and is hanging out in the Red Sea close to the coast of Sudan. Plus, the Navy has Seahawks (Blackhawks are Army). You can't eject from a helo-- why would the pilot yell ""eject, eject."" Also, a submarine communicating back and forth with the ship like that? I certainly hope MI6 doesn't recruit people like Olivia and if they do they don't visit their friends to provide details where the new agent is going. How could her editors not insist that she cover the terrorist attack if she witnessed it? I liked BJ's diary and I hope fielding goes back to that genre. I'm very frustrated with this and disappointed."
1,The WORST book I have EVER READ!!!,"This was honestly the worst book I have ever read. I normally will burn though all of my ""chick lit"" books really quickly...I didn't even make it past the 7th chapter of this book. My husband was SHOCKED to find a book that I didn't finish. The plot was terrible, the main character I just could not get into and I was confused. This was an absolutely terrible book. I love the Bridget Jones' books and was seriously disappointed."
