1,REALLY NOT WORTH GETTTING,"I don't have this changer but someone I know is requesting this as a baby shower gift. I saw this changer at the store and it really doesn't look sturdy at all. I am a new mom and I wouldn't purchase this. They grow out of this right away and if you have an active baby at 4 months, this is no longer of use. The only good thing about it is that it is affordable, but I just dont recommend it, for safety reasons. Also, I do recommend that if you are getting a dresser, Babies R Us carries the changer that you can place on top of the dresser( looks like a little mattress, just the right size), you can have your changer and once the little one outgrows it you can put it away and you can place frames and other cute things on the dresser. I hope this is of use to some."
1,terrible!,"Easy to put together & it looked nice for a few weeks, next thing I know it's falling apart! The table where baby rests has a support rod, but the lower 2 shelves do not. I only have a few diapers, wipes, etc. & the shelves have come out of their grooves! It looks terrible now. I may be able to fix the shelves, but then I won't be able to rest anything on them. It's a waste of money! Spare yourself the headache & go for a sturdier model. The good ones can be used for storage or books when you stop changing baby."
5,Perfectly practical item,"I don't know what ""shopperextrodinaire"" has against this changing table (and matching crib for that matter). It seems as though some people need help putting things together CORRECTLY! If babies were able to fall through and/or break this product, it would not be on the market! I bought this item and put it together easily (without help of hubby!) and have absolutely NO complaints! It's a beautiful piece for any nursery decor and it is STURDY so long as it is properly put together. I love it and also highly recommend the matching crib. You don't need to spend a ton of money to get quality in this case."
3,Great for the 1st year,"I originally wasn't going to get a changing table, but last minute decided on this one based on look, price and reviews. I have had it for 2 years now. The table is pretty sturdy, but you have to tighten the screws every couple of months. My biggest complaint is the back piece came off and almost impossible to get it back on with all the little spindles. At this point, we have basically given up after glueing it back together. For the price, it is easier to go buy a new one for our second child on the way. The weight restrictions are a little low and I think the company does that to cover their butts. My son is 29 pounds now and climbs up on to the changing table and I have never worried about it. I love the shelves for storage on diapers, wipes, clothes....."
1,Splurge for a better table!,I bought this for my 6 week old daughter because the price was nice and the table was attractive. I tried to put it together and I could not figure it out! It does not seem very sturdy at all and I would be worried putting her on it. I am returning it back to the store. My sister has the same table and her's is fine. Maybe I just picked up a bad one.
4,this is a great table,"this table is siomething you should get. for the amount, tis worth it totally, it took my boyfrind 10 mins to out together and it looks great in the babys room, my aunt has had hers for a year the only thing thats wrong is eventually you'll have to tighten the screws, but thats not bad at all"
3,cheap table,"This changing table MIGHT last for awhile, but the shelves are made out of cheap fiber board and do not hold much weight. The frame is nice for the price, but they really need to consider using something a little heavier and nicer for the shelves. They also don't have very good instructions for putting it together. It is confusing. Overall it will do, but we were disappointed with the quality. They obviously used the cheapest materials available."
4,Great product!,I think this changing table is fantastic for the price. It's sturdy and the color of wood is really nice. I only gave it 4 out of 5 stars because the changing pad is really too thin to be comfortable and some of the bars were damaged in shipment. I would recomend this table to anyone interested.
1,Used this for my first son(7 years ago),"I'm very surprised they haven't updated the model.. but looking through these reviews, I can see that they haven't changed a thing.This changing table was terribly unsturdy. I was CONSTANTLY tightening screws. Let me also mention that the whole thing collapsed before my son was even 8 months old. The cheaply made wood contributed greatly to this problem. Thankfully, my son wasn't hurt.I would caution anyone against using this product, until the company makes a sturdier model, with heavier wood.Looks nice, but that's about it."
5,a must have.,"We received this as a shower gift and love it. The shower was held after the baby arrived,so we did without a changing table for awhile,not sure how we managed. It was easy to assemble and has storage below."
1,changing table,I do not understand what the hold up is. It was ordered on the 29th of December and they say it won't be delivered until March 2 or 3rd. Can you tell my why? It is on 2 day shipment delivery. Thank you
1,Less than 1 star,I have no problem with the seller since they sent it quickly and there were 2 cd's. This is NOT a game! I uninstalled it within 5 minutes. I can't believe someone went to time and expense to create such a waste of time for the public.
2,These balls smelled funny,"I order all my balls with Amazon and I'm usually more than satisfied - but these were definitely the worst. The first thing I noticed is that the balls were coated in some kind of fine powder. It left my hands sticky and it smelled terrible. Did Amazon send me toxic balls? Who knows...Anyway, after I thoroughly cleaned the balls, I decided to see how they handle. Balance wasn't bad, and the balls appeared to be evenly weighted. The real problem was durability. These balls have to be handled pretty delicately, and really - who does that? After a few drops, one of the balls was already starting to show some wear. After less than a week, I've already retired them. The last thing I need is to have odd-smelling balls spilling their contents all over my living room."
2,too small,These balls are too small to juggle. They are not worth it even though they are cheap. They are also too hard.
3,Too light to use much,"I bought two packs, because I am so awesome, I can already juggle with three. I wanted to learn to use four, then who knows, maybe even five. JUGGLE WITH MORE THAN THREE? I figured that I would be fighting the male attention off with a stick. however, they are too light. I cut them open and put an ounce fishing weight in each, now they're perfect. On the bright side, the seam is easy to open to insert more weight. But you have to be dedicated."
3,Ok learning balls,"Very light (too light), and the durability is not there. These would be good for a kid, or something to fool around with for a bit. For the money this is an okay set to learn the skill of juggling."
3,The item I received didn't seem to be brand new.,The plastic tube that contained the juggling balls was obviously opened earlier using a knife; the product seems to be used. (I believe I purchased a brand new). It didn't affect usability of the set however. Good enough for the price! Maybe a little light.
3,Too light,"These balls are good for learning juggling only. After you done learning, these balls become too light for you to get better or more stable. I found limes or lemons can be better than these balls sometimes; they are heavier and you can get 8 limes for just $1 in supermarket, and they don't bounce much either.So these balls are good for learning the tricks, like for the first 3 weeks, and you will need to move to a better set to get advanced. If they fill the balls with heavier material, I will enjoy them more."
4,Bit small,"This is the first set of real juggling balls I have ever owned. They are a bit small compared to the various objects that I am use to picking up and trying to juggle. They are over stuffed, so they are hard and I would not say the easiest for young hands trying to learn.Educational value is limited... it's three balls, so unless you are trying to demonstrate the laws of gravity or some basic math. You would be better served buying something else for educating a young mind, but if you want to improve your hand-eye coordination this is not a bad set to start with."
1,Horoscopos are the worst of the worst/Peor de lo Peor,"No solo son unas de las mujeres mas nacas y orribles de la musica hispana, sino que son super creeidas para el talento regular que tienen. Que mala onda que las apremien siendo que solo graban musica agena. No gasto ni $3.00 en el disco usado que venden aqui!"
3,Works while nursing...,"The only way I can pump with this pump is to pump while my daughter nurses. I can't get let down otherwise. I used a hospital grade pump prior to this pump, so I can't tell if I'm just used to the best or what! I can only get 2 ounces even when she nurses on the other side. (I used to get 5+ ounces from my hospital pump!) I've heard great things about this pump, but I think it doesn't work for me!"
1,Didn't Work For Me,"I registered for and received the Avent Isis breastpump and have been very disappointed. I made the choice for this pump based on research and many opinions found here. Unfortunately, the pump never worked for me. I know that I used it correctly - I got plenty of suction - but it would never express my milk. Day or night, after a feeding, first thing in the morning, after applying warm compresses ... nothing. I tried a medical grade pump just to see if an electric would work for me. It did. In literally one minute my milk was flowing! It is just too bad that you can't try a pump before purchase. For me, this was a waste of money."
1,Replacement parts not available,The soft silicone piece that fits on your breast making the pump comfortable is not replaceable. You must buy an entirely new pump! Kind of expensive. The other parts are only available through the manufacturer. The pump actually worked pretty well for the time I was able to use it.
5,Better than the hospital pumps,"I don't know where to begin, yes its a little tedious to clean, but otherwise I can't say enough about this pump!! I used it for my last baby, wore it out, and am buying two this time around. Quick, efficient, and comfortable. I was filling 8 oz bottles within 1 1/2 months. Use it regularly to stimulate your flow and you will be amazed at how productive you can be. It will make you feel like supermom, especially when breast feeding is tedious or if you are not a public person."
1,lack of durability,"I love Avent bottles, but this product failed me. The neck of the main part(where you connect the valve) cracked when I assembled it for the first time. After using for about 3 weeks (pumping only 1 to 2 times daily), the plastic neck shattered."
2,"I liked it, at one time.","I liked it when it was new. The rubber ""petal"" part has a hole in it, and now it doesn't work right (just try using it without this, OUCH!). I only used this for a few months, it's just not worth the work that will go into replacing the part I need. Mine also leaked. It leaked down the handle and around the ""petal"" which made a vacuum to pull the milk under it."
2,BREAKS easily at NECK!!,"I was given an ISIS pump at my shower and used it a lot for the first 6 months after my baby girl was born. I loved it and had no complaints, until the neck on the largest part of the pump began to crack! I thought maybe I could have been a bit more careful, so I purchased a second one and was EXTRA careful. Now I need to pump daily because my baby eats cereal with my milk 3 times a day. It has only been TWO months and the SAME thing is happening. It is CLEARLY a major flaw in this product as many others have had the same problem.If anyone has ideas how to get the replacement part which I SHOULD BE GIVEN at this point let me know at utz@mindspring.com"
2,It Leaks!,"I used this when I became too sore to use my electric pump. The milk seeps under the pump guard and it leaks out from the edges onto clothes. I wouldn't even say getting this as a pump for when you're on the go is a good idea because the leaking milk will get all over leaving you with clean up. I had to buy a replacement part because the bottom part that screws on the base of the pump cracked from sterilizing (which it says you can do). They don't sell just that one little piece so I had to buy the actual pump again as a part. It cost nearly $30 to order this part and it took over 2 weeks to receive it. The entire system just isn't durable or made for much use. Also, cleaning down into the bend of this pump thoroughly is practically impossible."
2,unAventful,"I bought the pump at the suggestion of your many accolades to the ISIS pump, it was pretty, but it only last me about a month...The Plastic crumbled and the pump died...I was in the middle of pumping and the chassis of the thing just fell off. I bought another one, and the same thing happened. Was i too hard on the thing? The worst part is that you can only use AVENT Bottles to pump into, if there is an adapter they don't sell them where I have looked for them...I really hate this thing, it would have been nice if it would not have fell apart...the design is pretty to a fault.In any ""avent"" I am not discouraged...I am now using the Evenflow Electric Pump to my wonderful Baby Girl's delight!"
1,It works until it breaks,"The pump does work well. But if you have read any of the other reviews, you will find that it is nototious for cracking at the neck. I too recieved my one free replacement part and was delighted, until it broke soon after. When I called the second time for the part I was told I would have to pay $5.95 for the part and $8.95 for shipping. I explained that I fully read and followed the instructions and the pump still cracked after only four uses. The customer service rep. insisted that the pump broke due to improper use or care. I finaly spoke to a manager who sent me out one more complimentary part.Because of all of this hassle, I would not reccommend this pump. I need something more dependable."
1,Disappointed mommy,"I loved this breast pump in the beginning, but then the neck cracked and broke. I am a stay at home mom and only use the pump about three times a week. I was very disappointed."
5,It's so easy!,"This pump is great! I bought it after my unsuccessful use of an electric pump, I couldn't believe the difference. The electric pump that I used was a little painful (even on the lowest setting) and it took what seemed like forever to express a small amount of milk. The ISIS, on the other hand, was very gentle and I was able to express a lot more milk in a short amount of time. I use the Avent disposable bottles, so it is very convenient to pump directly into the bottle bags and store them in the refrigerator/freezer. This pump is also very easy to take apart and clean."
5,Better than expensive electric pump,"Wow. I've been using the Medela rental from the hospital for 3 weeks and now I regret it. This thing is awesome! Not only did it pull more milk from each breast, it does it faster! The other plus is that I can be out and about with my daughter and still be able to express milk. I'm not tied to the one little corner of the room that I have set-up to express milk. It can pump straight into the plastic disposable bag that I use for her bottles. The only thing that I don't like is that a bit of the milk gets trapped under the silicon suction cup."
3,It Does Tend To Break,"My pump did break after about 6months of use and then again after about another 3 months. You must take care when washing, so that you don't damage or lose any parts. There are alot of parts! For the most part however, the Isis did not give me any trouble and it was quite comfortable. When I first started pumping though it was slow going as opposed to a medela electric pump which worked really fast... but hurt."
3,wow,This book has too much detail. It is complex. This fascist government calls to mind our present President. People say he is a socialist but read this book if you can and you will change your tune to he is a fascist.
1,Not for the casual reader of history.,"This book is not for the casual reader of history, it is for serious scholarship only. I bought it to help me understand recent Italian history in preparation for a vacation in Rome. Big mistake. It is long, extremely detailed and assumes the reader is already familiar with the history of Fascist Italy."
2,Very disappointed in this MFLP title,"Our family must own 15 or 16 MFLP cd's. This is the first truly disappointing one. It is way too ""cutesy"" - many of the others have kids singing the songs, but in this one, the kids ruin the songs. I know that it could have been done better, because we have many other MFLP albums where children have sung classic rock n' roll and its been great. Stay away from this one! (Its gets 2 stars mainly because the music is great.) The album needs to be remixed and rerecorded. It could definitely be better."
1,Kids music collections,"I was looking for a collection of oldies for my children. While the titles were great, it was a huge dissapointment not to hear Elvis himself."
2,Takes Great pictures but,"This product takes great quality pictures but the camara internal software is spotty.Some times it will work with a USB, most times it will not. Very frustrating. After 6 months the USB features was not working & it started creating errors on all computers I tried it with. Their Technical support was nice but could not flash the camara or give me a software download, that was very disappointing.A driver disk should of come with the unit.They do not even have one. I will not purchase another product from Olympus due to the low tech answers & not being able to fix the problem."
1,Lost my pix,"Cute, nice display but apparently too easy to delete pix. 90 shots disappeared. I am no amateur. I have owned Casio, HP, (3) Sony Mavicas, Nikon 4300, and some cheapo that I threw away. Still use the Mavicas and Nikon. The tiny xD memory chip is small and difficult to handle, and it is in the battery case and you drop out batteries. Either the memory stick deleted itself or the delete sequence was initiated without my knowledge or realization. This is something I have never had happen before. Not happy camper."
3,Misrepresented,"Be aware that this camera is not the 'Stylus' model that it is claimed to be. It is a 'Camedia'. If I had known this, I would have purchased it in person because the person I am giving it to specifically asked for a 'Stylus'."
3,Okay for the price,"This camera is pretty easy to use. However, I have had a problem with battery life. I have only had the camera for a short period of time and have gone through six (6) batteries already. I have taken very few pictures which bothers me."
4,Nice little camera,"It may be small but I have no problem with it. It takes great pictures for the price.. I purchased rechargeable batteries and they last quite a while. I don't use it every day. This is my first camera and I got this because the reviews were favorable especially for the picture quallity. I had some pictures printed from an online source and they were very nice, about as good as my 35 MM camera.Very satisfied and would buy it again.PS. It would be nice if they included a small case for it though."
5,This is a Great Little Camera!,"The D535 is my first digital camera and I think it is a great camera for the price. The pictures are very sharp. The software is easy to load and use. The camera is easy to use. I have been taking close-ups for ebay auctions and other shots inside and outside. No complaints and nothing but priase for this little dude. Yes. It does suck up batteries but so does every other camera in this price range (I haven't looked at the more expensive ones). The flash is weak, but I looked at the reviews of about 20 others cameras priced $100-$200 and they all had that problem.Yhe cover for the USB plug in looks a little mickey mouse but it is functional. For $140, it exceeded my expectations!I often see wildly varying opinion on digital camera. I tend to think that some people expected too much for their money."
4,"ist time digital camera user, very pleased","Wanting something user friendly and simple, I couldn't have found something better for the price! Picture quality is great, easy to use and download to PC. If you are a little intimidated at the world of digital cameras, definitely a good place to start!"
3,So-so,"I brought this movie just Roy Dupuis was in it. The story is a account of the life of 3 explorers in the early 20th century. The friendship that came out of their journey. Most of the story is correct, but the director/writers did dramatize some parts. Still, I enjoy it."
5,"A great overview of blogging for the corporate world, and small businesses too.","I bought this book to educate myself more on how to approach clients with convincing ideas of why and how they should be blogging. I've been a blogger for years, but convincing small business owners of the importance of a blogging and social media strategy can be difficult. I recommend this book to my clients as well, as some are interested in learning as much as possible about the blogging world. It puts blogging into a perspective that is easily understood by clients. Great book."
3,An adventure in different-think.,"Persian and Indian influences in Judaism and Christianity are obvious to those who will familiarize themselves with the ancient religious teachings. ....interesting.That said, the Buddhist influences in Jesus' teachings are plainly there; behind them are Zarathustrian and Hindu thought."
1,Fire it up....just not to this,"I've liked KMK since high society, however long ago that was. I never listened to stoners reeking havok that much but i did like pimp twist. I've liked everything from royal highness until rollin stoned. I remember driving back from sacramento headed back home near l.a. i picked up the cd to listen to on the way back. after i got home i was pissed, i threw the cd out the window cuz it sucked so bad. there's nothing special on the cd. they're not that good at mixing hiphop with a majority of rock. they suck at it. i've liked all the other cd's they've put out. they just messed up on this album. hopefully their next one will be better."
2,Calm down guys,i guess the first thing you do when you right one of these is tell how long you've liked kmki heard suburban life on the scream 2 soundtrack and was instantly hooked. Since then I've seen KMK in concert 11 times.This cd was by far the worst thing ever put out by them. They are usually great at intergrating punk hiphop and raggae but it seems this time the tried too hardthe songs are too skitzo and they use too much of a punk influence this timeBRING BACK SAINT DOG
3,A little disappointed.,"I truly was a little dissapointed with this cd. With so many great KMK albums in the past, I never saw this coming. I am, however happy that they've quit talking about the same things with weed, over and over again. I was excited when I got this cd, but as I started listning to it, I was a bit disappointed with the lyrical structure and the beats. They're way too abrasive, they tried the punk/rap angle, and I don't believe they pulled it off very well. The song ""Johnny's Got a Problem"" while I find it funny, is awfully repetitive. I love the kings, but this is definitaly not their best effort. Maybe next time."
2,WEAK,"I've only listened to this cd once all the way through so it may grow on me, but every other kottonmouth king cd has had me through the 1st listen. This seriously sounds like songs they recorded during Rollin Stoned but weren't good enough to put on that album(and Rollin Stoned, a great album, was still their weakest effort). All the rap songs seem to have the same generic beat as did the Rollin Stoned album. Gone are the head bobbin beats of ROYAL HIGHNESS and HIGH SOCIETY. D-Loc just sounds like he doesn't even give a shi# on this album. The punk songs are annoying. The only really standout track I thought was ""bring it on."" If your a KMK fan, you know your gonna cop this, but just be warned, contrary to what duder from Alabama says...it's their weakest effort."
2,Very disappointed,"Items are NOT what is pictured. They seem ok, but poorly built. They don't state it in the ad, but there are two per box. I'll be returning one order I am waiting on receiving.As cheap as they were, I'll leave it in there for now. I'm sure it'll break if anyone put's any real effort into it."
1,flimsy buckle. broke instantly,buckle broke with modest strain during installation.cannot imagine actually putting serious strain on this itemuseless for anything except show
3,A little disappointed,"I read all the good reviews and bought this book. I have to say I am disappointed. There are not a lot of content in the book, as you can tell that the author intentionally increase the margin of each page to greatly increase the total page number. The diagrams are sketchy, of low quality.I happened to pick up a book ""building shed like a pro"" at local library, it is a whole lot better. If you go to book store and read both books, you will know what I mean."
5,A Great Way To Learn The Basics Of Shed Building,"This book has been a valuable tool in my understanding of the art of shed building. All of the elements that go into building a shed are discussed and diagramed in great detail. The old saying ""a picture is worth a thousand words"" is this books motto. Stiles' intricate detail takes all the guess work out of figuring out all of the necessary elements that go into building a shed. He starts by showing you the very basics and then goes into more detailed and complicated sheds. I've had this book roughly one month and I've read it cover to cover twice. I also read bits and pieces and study the pictures and diagrams at least every other day for a few minutes. I now feel ready to begin construction of my dream shed..."
4,The best of its kind,"This is the best ""shed"" book I have come across (surprisingly better than Taunton's take on the subject). It doesn't include every detail, it doesn't have the greatest illustrations, it has a somewhat mediocre collection of color images. But it has clear construction instructions, lots of great little ideas, and a mostly unspoken perspective on material use and geometric beauty and functionality that I find lacking elsewhere. A finer taste in sheds can be found (search for the ""Just Sheds"" photostream), but again, this is the best available book on the subject that I've come across. Adequate material lists, short bibliography, complete index. (Some gems on welcoming birds into your shed habitat too, ha!)"
4,A great help and great read,"This book was great, fun to read too. It gave plenty of ideas and advice. It wasn't the only book I used when building my shed but, certainly was the one I used the most. I recommend this book for anyone who's never built a shed before."
4,Flexibility,OXO make excellent products. I purchased an OXO Good Grips Large Nylon Flexible Turner and am pleased with the flexibility. You are able to really get under what you are trying to turn.
2,There is such a thing as too flexible,"I typically love OXO products, but I found this turner to be just too flexible. I found it could not bear up under much weight at all, and bent too much. I suppose this could be an asset in some circumstances, but I have struggled to find them. Just not a useful item for me."
2,Flip flop,"I had purchased the small version of this flexible turner a few years ago and loved it. By mistake I ordered the Large OXO one when the old one broke. This one is too big and too floppy. After washing with hot soap and water, the whole thing bent out of shape. I've only used it 3 time and it's now a wavy turner and good for nothing."
5,Pancake flipper,Durable and flexible. Use it to flip pancakes all the time. Small edge on the front makes it easy to slide under everything you are cooking.
1,Melted...,"After the very first time I used this spatula, I noticed that the edge started to melt. I only used it to make eggs!!! Maybe I held the tip on the pan for too long? Unlikely...very sad. I continue to use the product and noticed that little white spots had appear toward the edge. It's also flimsy."
1,It doesn't cut it,"The small one is much better, this big one is too floppy to be of much use. I tried it even on pancakes and it didn't have the firmness to slip under and dislodge what parts were sticking to the pan, which another, sturdier turner handled very well. The small one is better although after only one month's use, it began fraying at the tip. Why they do this I don't know. I'm still looking for a good turner that is strong, thin and doesn't fray at the end after very little use. It used to be that one could use a turner for years before signs of fraying."
4,Wild magic in the heart of the city,"For one or two weeks every two months I live in an apartment at the base of Telegraph Hill, a place of true magic. I could not believe my ears the first time I heard the parrots, or my eyes, the first time I saw them! I soon found Mark Bittner's web site, complete with wonderful photos of the parrots and the story of his connection with them. What a pleasure, then, to find in my local Massachusetts book store, a copy of this wonderful book. Mr. Bittner takes us with him as his relationship with the parrots becomes inextricably woven into his life search for meaning. His study of the parrot's lives, first undertaken by chance, becomes a life's work of real interest to anyone who has an affection for animal life in general, or these amazing birds in particular."
4,Color pictures are on website,"What a wonderful love story between a person and his parrots! I enjoyed reading the story of how he learned about parrots.The book has black and white pictures, but many color pictures of the parrots are on Mark's website, along with a story that illustrates the photo.While I would like to see color photos in the book, publishers don't always do as readers (and authors) would like! The book is a must-buy for bird-lovers!"
5,as a pet parrot guardian,"I was worried about feeling guilty reading more about wild parrots leading a natural life, but couldn't resist reading this after falling in love with the movie. And actually, I learned a little about how to observe my own pet parrot and trying to meet his needs for companionship, exercise and variety in his surroundings after reading this. Simple, lovely prose, spiritual context. Definitely worth reading and owning."
3,Wild Parrots of Telegraph Hill,"I bought this book because I love the city of San Francisco. I will admit that I have only read about half the book. I hope to finish it later. You'd have to really love parrots to really love this book, so far!"
3,"It's cute, but nothing special","It's a cute story, with a bit of a fairy tale ending, but personally I couldn't get past the fact that the guy is a bum. He brags about not paying rent for 28 years, and continually alludes airily about being on a ""journey,"" that's more important than actually earning your keep, apparently.I found his lifestyle to be a huge distraction."
3,WASN'T CLEAR THAT THERE WAS A BOOK AND DVD.,WAS DISSAPOINTED AS I THOUGHT I WAS ORDERING THE DVD AND GOT THE BOOK INSTEAD.
2,only the parrots earn a star,"This book was about a fascinating subject, but the narrator himeself left much to be desired. He really put me off the subject, since his own musings and spiritual journey were of such a passive nature. I mean, this guy continually describes his search for a ""path"" but does nothing to find it, other than sit around (for DECADES) as time moves on. I guess he's waiting for Buddha himself to bang on the door. It's like someone who claims to be looking for the keys to go for a drive, but will not get off the couch to look for them, then whines and complains he wants to go for a drive. Just really tiresome to hear of his inability to act. If you notice as you read it, even when he gets to know about the parrots, it's still all about HIM. How they relate to him and not vice versa. Pathetic."
1,Give this one a miss,There is not good book on biotech investing. The Biotech Investor's Bible is poorly written and badly organized. I find the same companies provided as examples again and again. Some of them no longer exist! The risk of this industry was not sufficiently highlighted.The author groups companies based on market capitalization; I believe that this approach is fundamentally flawed. It runs the risk of feeding right into a mania.I would like to have seen more comment on the stalwart biotech companies.I did not learn much from this book. Perhaps that is the point. This area is a challenge.
2,Old news,"This might have been a good book at the time....but it is grossly outdated, and much of the book focuses on some pretty basic investing practices."
2,Found it to lack real substance,"Maybe this book would be good for a total beginner biotech investor, or a total beginner investor (in which case biotech probably shouldn't be what you're focused on). I found it lacking in real actionable substance and basically stated many obvious points."
3,It's ok,"This book is fine, just not my favorite. The information is wonderful of course, but I guess it just wasn't my style of writing. But again, the messages are great."
3,A Little Too Much,"I think Mr. Williams write beautifully. His style flows through the whole book, his concert reviews are rather unique, and, even though I have never had the opportunity to see a Dylan concert, I really could grasp a good picture of them. The only problem is: I think the reviews should have been made a bit less fan-ish. I cannot be sure about the concert part, but the album reviews have such an exaggerated tone that, more than once, I had to think if the album he had reviewed was the same I had listened to. I love Bob Dylan. But, come on, making no difference in quality between albums like Blood on the Tracks and World Gone wrong does sound more like a fan writting than a critic."
1,Try Cat-Sip Real Milk,"I bought this one time when PetSmart was out of Cat-Sip Real Milk. My cats wouldn't even try it. They ran up to it excitedly, expecting it to be Cat-Sip. They each sniffed it, and literally turned their noses up! Then they just walked away. It didn't go to waste as my dogs were excited to have it. Passed the dog taste test, but that doesn't mean much. After reading the ingredients, I probably shouldn't have even fed it to my dogs. Full of random stuff: guar gum, corn syrup solids...just to name a couple. And it is completely watered down too. I'm going to stick with Cat-Sip, and I recommend you try that brand as well. Cat-Sip has only 3 ingredients; low fat milk, lactase enzyme (to help the cats break down the dairy as cats are naturally lactose intolerant), and taurine (an essential nutrient for cats). Also, Cat-Sip is usually a few cents cheaper than the Wiskas stuff!"
2,Chess Problems,"As another reviewer stated, the chess game is messed up. But on mine, the problem is that it is impossible to win. Even on the easiest difficulty setting, it's as though you are playing a Grand Master.I have not looked into the other stated problems, but I have no doubt they exist. Hoyle computer board games just aren't like the real thing."
3,Hoyle Puzzle and board,"It's having a bit of trouble downloading to my new computer,but, I sure that I will have the kinks out in no time."
3,Not Much New,There isn't much that's new in this new version of Hoyle games from the previous version (2005) we had.
5,Outstanding,"This is a great DVD game, since I purchased it I log on everyday to play with it and I find I am playing for hours upon hours. Also, I enjoy the game variety that is included on this DVD. I highly recommend this DVD to everyone and I hope they enjoy it as much as I do."
4,Memory Exercise,I have tried several of the games and find they are not only fun but are good to help increase your memory.
2,Nothing New Here,"There is nothing new and different from what Hoyle 2005 has already offered.Hoyle games are the best games around, but save your money if you're looking for a new and improved game since 2005. Everything is the same on the Board Games. No new characters. No new objects to purchase. No new games to try. Backgrounds are a repeat of 2005 too.I never played the 2005 Puzzles, so I can't speak about the sameness, but these 2007 puzzles are boring to me. They may be to anyone who loves the challenge of the word and board games. If clicking on matching tiles, searching for hidden objects on a grid, and rolling a ball through a maze amuses you, you may find it worth the money and time invested in playing. I do not. Some games will not play on Windows 2000.My other PC has Windows Vista. Neither disc will download into that version of Windows."
1,We are on our third reorder!,"I was very impressed with this players sound quality. I also loved the added feature of the under-counter light. However, both our first and second unit stopped working after about 3 days. The clock stopped functioning and all switches led to radio sound, meaning one could no longer play a cd. My husband is wondering if it is a design flaw due to the fact that the unit gets quite hot if the counter light is left on. I'm willing to try it one more time, but if number 3 is a dud, I'd wait for a redesign."
1,Defective and GE Support Non Existent,"Remote was defective, didn't work from the start. Batteries got very hot. Replaced w/new ones, and they heated up immediately. Called GE Support and they said they couldn't do anything w/out serial #, even tho I had reciept, model #, etc. and volunteered to mail remote back to them. Serial # is on back of unit, and when mounted acc to GE instructions it is not visible w/out removing from cabinet (which in our case would be a major hassle). I explained this and they refused to provide any assistence, even after I appealed to several diff reps. Worst customer service I have ever encountered. I will NEVER purchase another GE product."
2,CAUTION !,"This amplified ringer only works on telephones with a ""corded handset"" that is attached to the telephone base. Unfortunatley, the advertisement for this unit does not disclose this serious limitation. IT WILL NOT WORK ON ANY CORDLESS TELEPHONE BASE."
2,Maybe a defective unit,"Tried another Clarity and it worked OK, but just OK. This one would take 5 or so seconds to connect at the onset of a call, preventing conversation and filling the line with clicks. It did amplify (some) but not very much."
4,Works Good for Most Situations.....,"This amplifier works good for most standard situations. If you have an older telephone with a standard telephone company hookup you will be pleased. In a work situation, it works well with a standard 7960 VOIP CISCO phone. It does NOT WORK WELL WITH MY VOIP MAJIC JACK. I called Clarity and made them aware of this. (so the rule of thumb is the more standard your telephone setup is, the more likely it will work well). Over all I think you will be pleased with the product."
4,No Brainer!,"It's the album that made Madonna a true Icon(in her transition from music superstar to Music Legend)! Listen well, and you might hear the great story it tells.Every Adult should own it(note the 'Advisory' label) - now if only they'd release an Anniversary Edition, that either includes the videos, or a reprinting of the Madonna's SEX Book, then I'd be giving it 5 Stars(get to it Ciccone)!"
3,Not a bad explanation,"I wouldn't say I'm a believer, but why does every culture have some kind of shapeshifting creature like the Werewolf? This story gives an explanation that can be either believed or not. It was entertaining if nothing else."
1,Having read The Demonologist...,"I would not even waste my money on something about 'werewolves'. There's no such creatures as these. The Warrens are in need of psychiatric help.As for Maine rose, who cares if that guy wnats to rip the Warrens...?!? Ed was strange, and his wife is still! The Demonologist was outlandish!"
1,All Fluff,"I was extremely disappointed with this book. It doesn't go into detail on anything. Instead, Mark feels like a half paragraph on most details will cover it. I have yet to hear of an engineer that is satisfied with fluff. What Mark Davis will describe is how the power of God helped him invent. In fact, the forward is written by his priest! I am sorry, but... I don't want someone telling me that invention comes from divine intervention."
3,Oh how the mighty have fallen...,"It is a bonafide tragedy what the folks responsible for this DVD have done to the Gunny!! Not even a proper DVD menu! That is to say nothing of the fact there has been very little in the way of extras on these Mail Call DVDs to begin with. And as always, I am wondering aloud why on earth they don't include ALL episodes of the season?The stars of this rating are purely for the Gunny, who travels to some awesome destinations including hallowed ground that is Iwo Jima. The Gunny sure deserves better treatment than he got here. Cue the Taps...Hoo-rah!!"
4,Nice pad,"This pad has worked very well for the last 7 months. In fact, it is the only pad we use (we have only one of these). Follow the label instructions for washing/drying and it will last (low heat always). The only issue I've had is it does not fit super snuggly at the bottom of our Supermaxipedic mattress, but that hasn't been a big issue."
3,good back up pad,"Liked this pad except for the waterproof backing, my child sweats so much as it is the vinyl backing just makes it worse. The pad itself is nice. I'm still searching for a nice all cotton pad with no vinyl backing!!!!!"
1,Strong vinyl smell and pilling,"I registered for and received this item at my baby shower thinking that I had found a great product to protect the crib mattress. When I took the pad out of its bag, I realized that there was a strong vinyl smell to it but figured that it would go away after I washed it, but I was wrong. Not only did it still smell, it also started to pill. I'm surprised that no one else noticed this!"
3,Toxic smell,I'm trying to get the toxic smell out of this mattress pad. I've washed it 4 times so far and now I'm airing it outside. It is the plastic liner that smells toxic. The pad itself is quite a lot thinner than I expected based on the reviews. It might make a difference in wetness protection but I don't imagine it could make much of a difference in comfort.
3,I would get the pad without the waterproof liner next time..,"I ended up with this mattress pad and a similar one from the same company that doesn't have a waterproof plastic liner. The pad with the waterproof liner after being washed on cold and dried in the delicate cycle, now has many small slits in the plastic that ""water"" can leak through. I also realized that my $100 mattress is waterproof itself, the mattress cover is plastic-like so I doubt if any ""water"" gets on it, it won't be ruined at all. I suggest buying the same mattress pad without the plastic waterproof liner instead, most of the crib mattress are waterproof anyway.That's my two cents. Hope it helps."
1,Possible SIDS risk,"I think every parent is tempted to make baby's sleeping environment as cozy and soft as possible. I certainly am. I was all set to buy this item for my baby's crib. But I did some research about the safety of crib products, especially through the SIDS Alliance and the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC). Both groups advocate a FIRM mattress covered with a tight fitting crib sheet, and no padded mattress tops or soft mattress pads/covers. This is to prevent accidental suffocation if babies roll on to their stomachs and cannot lift their heads from the soft or fluffy surface. Please do some research for yourself before making a decision."
3,"OK, but doesn't help with sweating","My hope when I purchased this is that it would reduce my baby's sweating caused by his vinyl crib mattress. Although there is a substantial cotton pad above the ""waterproof under layer"", it still caused my son to sweat when he slept on it. His crib mattress is already vinyl, so it didn't need another layer of waterproofing. The padding wasn't as thick as I was expecting it to be. I found one that is 100% cotton in a Toy'R'Us store, and it seems to help with the sweating much better."
2,Maybe it's just me...,"I followed all the washing & drying directions and the plastic underside of the mattress pad wound up melting. I bought another one and instead of putting it in the dryer as instructed, left it out to air dry. You may want to try this with yours."
4,Nice and Soft for Baby,"I wanted a soft cushiony cover for my son's mattress. I first bought the Sealy brand, and although it fit very well, it wasn't as thick as I thought it would be. So I exchanged it after 1 night for the UltraSoft, which is the same price. The UltraSoft definitely has a bit more cushion than the Sealy, and feels very soft and comfortable. I only gave it 4 stars b/c it's too large for the standard mattress and took some extra effort to pull it taught and tuck it all underneath. I haven't washed it yet, but so far am happy with my purchase."
3,"fluffy, yet not fitted",this mattress pad is very quilted and fluffy - very comfortable (and safe) for baby. One of the best I've used - we just had our 3rd child. The downfall is that it does not fit the mattress all that well - it is too large - but we made it work because we like the comfort of it so much.
5,Fits Our Mattress Tightly But Be Sure Its Yours Correctly,This fits our crib mattress tightly and keeps our baby from sweating against the vinyl of the crib mattress. We didn't have a mattress pad with our son and he would wake up soaking wet from sweating against the vinyl of the crib mattress. The crib sheet alone wasn't enough to keep him from sweating. This pad is also not too bulky so it doesn't cause a safety concern. Just make sure the pad fits TIGHTLY on YOUR crib mattress for safety's sake. We have a Sealy Crown Jewel Mattress and it fits great on it.
4,nice crib Pad,"I bought this mattress pad several months ago and I'm very satisfied with it. Washes well.(after I was really worried because some people said it melted in the dryer!) Keep the dryer on low, the washer on warm wash, I suggest very little (if any) bleach and it comes out great. The reason for 4 stars? The padded top could be a little thicker, it's not as soft and luxurious as it sounds."
3,DRY ON VERY LOW HEAT ONLY!!!,"I ordered this mattress pad and once it arrived, I washed it to put on the crib. Directions say to wash on warm and dry with low heat, the washing was fine and 1/2 way through the dry cycle, I pulled the pad out and was horrified to see that the plastic backing was stuck to itself in so many places, I just couldn't pull it apart! In addition, the plastic lining was ripped in three places. I called the nearest BRU store and they said that with the receipt, packaging and damaged product, I could receive a refund or exchange it for something else. The pad seems great, just a problem with the lining, so I'm going to look for one that is unlined. Also the plastic smell was a little overwhelming, even once I took it out of the dryer. Great pad, but very high maintenance!"
4,"Great for older child, not for newborn","We've enjoyed this pad very much for our 21-month-old daughter, but as a previous reviewer mentioned, I would not get it for a newborn. Soft and cushiony are great for later on (we only got this a few months ago), but the concerns regarding a very young baby being unable to move their neck enough to turn their head away from the mattress are real and serious. This site also sells something called the ""Ultimate Mattress Pad"" which we were very satisfied with when our daughter was younger. It's much firmer but still provides a layer of wetness protection."
1,Fell apart after one wash. Lame.,"Had it not fallen apart after one wash, this would have been the perfect mattress pad. It never even made it into the dryer. What a waste of money."
1,Very Disappointing,"I purchased two of these mattress covers right before our daughter was born. I was initially very pleased with the pads' comfort and the additional cushioning that they provided the mattress. Unfortunately, after washing these covers, I was extremely disappointed in the waterproof bottom layer. I washed one of the two pads that I purchased right away. As another reviewer mentioned, the pad was utterly shredded after being washed in the washing machine. Although the top, cushiony layer remained intact, the waterproof layer was in pieces. I thought I might have a defective pad, so I washed the other cover, only to have the same thing happen. My daughter is now 8 months old, and I have to wash her sheets frequently...and I am having to replace these pads (which weren't cheap in the first place). I would not recommend these mattress pads."
2,"Adequate history, but not special. Where are the maps?","An adequate overview of the history of the British Isles, but I have to agree with another reviewer's judgment of ""not what I expected."" I was anticipating a full volume that focused on the pre-Roman history of the British Isles and the different peoples known from ancient sources and archeological investigation. But that is all over and done with in the first fifth of the book. Then it's on to the Romans and medieval invaders like the Angles, Saxons and Vikings -- fairly well covered territory.This is not a bad book. It's just not special. Caution: have a supplementary historical atlas at hand as you read. There are no maps in the book, a stunningly bad decision by the publisher."
2,Not what I expected,I was expecting an analysis of the British population based on DNA. There was virtually none of that in here. It is a mildly interesting history of Britain.
2,Good for occasional pumping,"I would recommend this pump for occasional use. I am a stay-at-home mom and didn't think I would need an expensive electric pump. But after using this for 5 months, I switched to the Medela Pump in Style and what a difference! With the Isis I could only pump early in the morning when I had the most supply and only if my son hadn't nursed in a few hours. It was hard to get the let-down reflex and I rarely pumped more than 2-3 ounces at a time. For the most efficient pumping I would recommend an electric pump."
1,Frustrating - Simply did not work for me!,It's a nice little starter set but unfortunately this pump never worked for me. I had no shortage of milk when I actually nursed my baby but I was hardly able to get out the smallest drops of milk with this pump. It was awkward to use and tired my hands out as I tried to find a way to pump and maintain the suction. It never felt like it fit my breast quite right and was uncomfortable. I experiemented with the pressure and speed over several weeks but never found a combination that got much milk. I quit using it when I realized that using the pump was putting my breastmilk production out of wack and causing my baby to cry and pull away from the breast because of her getting too much milk during a nursing. (How frustrating that it would mess up my milk supply but not let me capture any of the surplus for later use!) With this next baby I'm going to try the top of the line electric medula and hope that it will work.
2,doesnt work well,This pump does not work well at all. It took a long time to get maybe 3 ounces out. I went through 3 pumps as a first time mother trying to find the easiest way to get my milk out. This was my first pump. It also has alot of parts to clean. No way does it compare to an electric pump. I bought a cheap one by EVENFLOW that one I liked the best. It was faster and not so many parts to clean. Don't waste your money on this one.
3,"Nice, but not for frequent pumpers.","I received this item from off my registry and put it to work. My baby was a month early and only 4.5 lbs and had to receive her feeding through a tube and then through a bottle in the NICU. I really wanted her to have breastmilk exclusively, and so I had to pump for EVERY feeding. I used this pump for awhile and it worked fairly well, but it became exhausting. My pump seemed to squeek a lot when in use, and a part of it would pop out of place sometimes. It got the milk out and was pretty painless. I eventually got the Medela Pump in Style pump, and I am much happier with it. I would recommend the Isis pump to people who only pump occasionally. It works pretty well for the price, but it is by no means the Medela."
2,"Frustrating, painful, and not worth it","I bought this pump thinking that a manual would be more convenient when I went back to work- I don't always know when I can pump, and finding an outlet could be a problem, etc. The first time I tried to pump, it was excrutiatingly painful. Furthermore, most of what I pumped was sucked back into the ""cushion"" covering and dripped down onto me. Eventually, I got to where I could pump 2-3 ounces from both breasts combined in about 90 minutes. We knew if we wanted to keep breastfeeding our daughter, this pump would not work, so we bit the bullet and bought the Medela pump-in-style. It was so worth it!! The first time I pumped, I got four ounces from each breast, and it didn't hurt a bit. I love the Avent milk storage and bottles, but this pump didn't work for me at all."
5,The best there is,"I nursed my first daughter for 2 years. I used this pump all the time. I worked, and went to school full time. I had originally bought an electric pump, but was very disappointed with the amount of milk expressed. I bought the isis and did not have to worry about it being loud, or heavy to carry. I was able to express a lot of milk in just a few minutes. This is the one ""must have"" for breastfeeding mothers."
1,really less than one star....,"I have a newborn daughter and I have to say that this pump is the WORSE manual breat pump ever. I am engorged right now, and not only is the constant boiling a problem ( if you don't boil the pump before each use, the suction is horrible), it leaks constantly. I've lost so much milk trying to use this pump. The storage bottles are really nice, but the pump - don't purchase it."
2,Another one that the Neck of the pump Cracked,Worked wonderful & was very happy with it until the neck of the pump cracked. It is useless now.The bottles & nipples are wonderful. My baby took to them instantly.My other children used platex nursers & they did not take to those as well as these bottles.As for the pump though i was very very disappointed. Spend the $60.00 on just their bottles instead of the pump kit.
1,Manual pumps are too hard to use!,"I'm sure that this pump measures up well to other manual pumps, but I cannot stress how much harder it is to use than an electric/battery operated one. I have an Evenflo hand held one which cost about $30-$40 and is great. I pump once per evening. And at work I have the Medela Pump in Style, which is a double, heavy duty pump and is quite a bit more expensive, at around $270. But worth the extra money for lots of every day pumping. My doctor warned that manual pumps are not worth the hassle and he was 100% correct in my opinion. I got this manual pump as a gift. I tried it several times before giving up for lack of patience and time, trying to get it to work properly."
2,Sqeaky little pump,"I bought this on the recommendation of many pumpers and I just don't get it. Sure it works fine, but who can stand the noise. My motorized Medela Pump in Style is more discreet. I swtiched to the Medela Harmony Hand pump. Plus, I no longer have to transfer from one bottle to another."
2,MANUEL PUMPING WASNT 4 ME,"I had NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO idea..!!! I only recieved this pump - no electrical one and I wanted 2 diiiiie! I was in pain for days after I gave birth,irritable because of the lost of sleep and trying to conform to the babies temporary sleeping pattern. I had a low milk supply and breastpumping for 1 hour for only 4ounces - this was not a joke! I wanted 2 diiiie I tell you.. I would finish pumping and da baby would be getting up for a feeding... NOooooo! already, I would think... yes and with only 4 oz to show. Here I go with the stupid MANUEL pump... NO.. I NOW know better.... electronic and a good brand- so what you pay 300. and change its worth your sanity, sleep, time, energy and appreciation for the bond with the baby. My milk supply in time grew (not soon enough) I am still nursing and again the manuel pump and I did NOT have a good relationship. We started off badly"
1,did not work,I bought this item and it did not work well it took forever to express milk and would not seal very well on the breast i also bought another manual pump that worked great i would not spend the money on this product.
3,Sometimes hard to get suction,"I have had a lot of difficulty getting any suction with this product - it often takes ten minutes or so, with a lot of taking the pump apart and putting it back together before I finally do. Once suction is achieved, it works well."
1,GO WITH AN ELECTRIC PUMP,"I bought this to use with my Avent bottles (which by the way LEAK) and I was very disappointed. My doctor told me to pump to stimulate my milk production which was coming in slowly. I could not get very much with this and needless to say it was not helping. Once I started using a Medela Electric pump, I got tons of milk! I was skeptical about the price, but it's totally worth it if you want to be able to use a pump on a regular basis."
1,Don't bother with a hand pump,"If you will be separated from your baby regularly. I could never get more than a couple of tablespoons of milk with this one, and many of my friends had a similar experience. It was incredibly demoralizing, and unnecessarily so, as I went on to be an all star pumper with a good electric breast pump (Bailey, Ameda and Medela all make good ones). Even an ""expensive"" electric pump is about one quarter the cost of a year's worth of formula! A friend gave me good advice, a little too late: don't by a breastpump from a company that makes the bulk of their money from bottle-feeding supplies. The pumps from these companies are typically an afterthought."
2,A Disappointment,I bought this pump after a few friends raved about it. I never found it to be helpful and wonder if I'd have been successful with bf if I hadnt' rented a hospital grade pump. I now use the Pump in Style and it works great. Don't waste your money on this pump. I love the Avent bottles and nipples though.
2,This breast pump is a disappointment,"I love the Advent line & highly recommend their bottles & microwave sterilizer, but this breast pump is awful! The prong that connects to the handle, which creates the vacuum to pull the milk out, consistently becomes unlatched breaking the vacuum so you have to fix it and start all over. The only reason it got a two stars rating was because the pump handle does fit extremely well on the bottles and everything fits in the bag nicely."
3,Not the greatest,"I read all the reviews on this pump but still wasn't convinced about buying this pump. I originally purchased a Gerber pump and it worked until it cracked. I asked a lactation consultant what kind of pump she'd recommend and she recommended Avent and Medela. I needed a pump in my price range so I chose the Avent.I like how the suction mimics a baby's latch but milk gets stuck everywhere and it leaks all over the place. The pump also makes an annoying squeaking noise and sometimes I lose suction. I'd recommend this pump over Gerber though. I will give it credit though, it's a lot easier to take apart and clean."
3,"Good as far as manual pumps go, but not for the working mom","I went back to work 3 full days a week when my son was 10 weeks old. I didn't want to spend $200+ on the PIS, so I ""saved"" money by getting the Isis for about $50 at Target. Well, I ended up getting the PIS anyways b/c it would have taken me 2x as long to pump at work. I couldn't get as much with the Isis, and with having to pump both sides... it would have just taken forever.It's OK if you just need to pump a few times a week, but if you have to go back to work at all, it will be much harder to continue pumping and breastfeeding if you don't have an electric."
5,Excellent Pump!,"I read through many reviews of different pumps on-line before purchasing this set. I have been using a Medela pump rented from the hospital since coming home, and quickly came to love my Avent Isis pump just as much if not more. Despite only being able to pump one side at a time, it is very quiet, efficient, comfortable and the travel case (with ice-packs) is VERY convenient and discreet. Tip - be prepared to practice a few times before you get the hang of it (it only took 3 times before I was producing milk at the same rate of my electric pump). Also, I found that massaging/squeezing my breast in alternating places with one hand while the other pumped helped the milk flow faster."
2,Could Be Better,"After reading all the great reviews, I bought this pump as a backup for the electric (Medela Pump In Style Traveler) pump that I keep at work. Well, I've only used the Isis a few times, but so far I don't like it very much. The manufacturer claims it's quiet and discreet, but half way through the first use, the handle started making a loud creaking noise. Also, the tubing is not angled downward, so I have to lean forward while pumping to let the milk run into the bottle. It comes with a fancy looking rubber piece that is supposed to help with let-down, but I had to take it off to get any suction at all! A lot of milk collects in the well of the pump and doesn't drip into the bottle - a real waste since I was only able to get one ounce from one breast in ten minutes with this pump. Overall, the Medela pump is far better. I do like the Avent bottles, but you can use them with the Medela pump if you buy Avent's adapter kit."
2,Save your $$,"We received this pump as a gift from our registry & were very excited---until I used it. It is time consuming to use, cannot maintain suction & use of it is almost enough to make me want to give up breast feeding entirely!Save your money & invest in another pump!!"
1,Pump Broke...,"The pump broke the 2nd time it was used, it took up to a half hour to pump 3 ozs, I hated this pump but loved the bottles."
2,Not a good choice for back to work,"I bought the Isis Back-to-Work set when my son was born 3 months ago. After much frustration with the pump, which would break suction every few minutes requiring me to reposition before I could start again, I called a lactation consultant who advised this was a common problem. On her advise I purchased the Ameda Purely Yours electric pump set, which is very reasonably priced. I have been very pleased with this pump, which works very quickly and with minimal hassle.The Isis pump did, however, work fine for an occasional bottle and the compact size & carrying case of the Isis set is a plus. It is very discreet for use at work. I have actually recycled the carrying case as a cooler when taking my sons bottles to daycare."
3,Great if you like to replace frequently,"I bought this pump shortly after my daughter was born, and started using it when she was about a month old. Within a month, it crack where the pump screws onto the bottle lid. I wrote to Avent and they sent me a replacement part, which I was happy with. Now, two months later, it cracked again! I'm about to give up on this pump simply because it's a big inconvenience to have it keep breaking. It's a great pump when it's not broken, but it's obviously not made that well. Although I wrote to avent again expressing my dissatisfaction with this product, I will probably purchase another brand of pump since I will continue to express milk for at least another 5 months or so."
3,not so good for the little ones.....,"For small-busted women, or women with lowish supply this is definitely not the answer. Especially if you are going back to work full time. The Avent bottles however are amazing and incredibly durable."
1,NOT FOR ME!!!!,"I purchased this pump because I had a friend that raved about it. I on the other hand just could not figure it out. I couldn't get any suction and when I did get suction NOTHING! I ended up just renting an electric one from the hospital and had no problems. I kept going back to it....reading the directions....problem solving....trying again and still NOTHING! Manual pumping just wasn't for me, I guess. Mabe I just had a defective one. None the less Electric is the way to go for any new mom. Good Luck!"
2,Decent but not for working moms,"This is an affordable manual pump set. It's good for occasional use but not for the mom who's returning to work and wishes to store milk from 9 to 5 (plus commute time). Two problems, 1st, the bottles are small and won't store much, 2nd, it's *very* tiring to manually pump even just for a few minutes at a time (more like 15-20 minutes each time). Your wrist and forearm will fatigue and cramp up. Go for an electric pump that can store enough milk from a typical 9-hour working day."
3,NOT for full time pumping,"I got this pump before my baby was born because I knew I would have to go back to work when he was 6 weeks old. Pumping with this was fine until I ran out of my stored milk and was desperately trying to pump enough each day for his next day bottles for daycare. It was very slow going, and my breasts were aching all day because I couln't pump enough to empty them. I finally got an electric pump that works great.I would only recommend this pump if you need to pump occasionally, not for full time pumping moms."
4,Nice product,"I purchased this breast pump on recommendation & am glad I did. It is very easy to use, I can pump one handed if needed. I used an electric pump with my son, however I found I have more control with the Isis hand pump. I was able to stay home with daughter, however if I had gone back to work this pump would have been perfect. The only drawback is the pump does not fit on Playtex Nursers which is the bottles I use, if it would fit on my bottles I would have rated it 5 stars. This is a minor drawback though, I simply transfer the milk to my bottles when ready and the handy bag is a nice feature."
1,A Disappointment,"This pump is the manual pump recommended to me by the lactation consultant who taught my breast-feeding class. I have to say that overall I've been disappointed with the pump. The set itself seems to be a value, for the number of accessories, nipples, bottles, etc. that you recieve. However, I have had the hardest time getting the pump to have strong enough suction to pull any milk out of my breasts - and I have very good flow!! The two times that I have been able to get any suction, I practically had to assemble the pump under water to get a good enough seal between the silicon pieces and the hard plastic pieces. But, you end up having tap water mixed in with your milk - not so nice. And the quantity of milk that I was able to get in a 10 minute session of pumping was just a couple of tablespoons."
3,Careful It Breaks,"This breast pump is great if you don't want to take it anywhere. At home it was wonderful, it pumped quickly and effeciently. However the first trip out I put it in the diaper bag and it cracks. Rendering it absolutely useless! You can barely even see the crack but the pump no longer creates suction. The manufacturer obviously knows this because they provide an extra neck to the pump. However if the pump itself cracks you have to buy a whole new one. All in all I'm going to buy a new and different one ..."
2,Not too impressed,"All of the reviews on this product that I read were good but I got it home I was not very impressed. I found it hard to operate and it hurt my nipples. I know pumping does not feel wonderful, but I was in pain. It has a bunch of little parts and if you don't put it together just right it won't work. I recommend saving your money and just buying a medela."
3,Not all breasts are made alike,"Mine just didn't work with this pump. It wasn't operator error - it worked, it just didn't work well, and it didn't work equally well on both breasts (one is larger). I had to go with an electric, and even then I still would have been better off with a variable shield."
2,"worked at first, and became a great source of fustration","I got this pump for my shower and it was wonderful at first. 2 to 3weeks later it just got me fustrated and i almost smashed it a number of times. It kept loosing suction and i would spend hours trying to pump 2 ounces of milk. It actually became faster expressing manually,then i had to look for something else, after complaining to avent and not getting a solution.With the new pump.. harmony medela, I discovered that the cup for the avent was too big for me,(Used a size 34 A cup before pregnancy.)and it would not fit on the valves that the baby usally sucks on to stimulate letdown.Thus would not write off the pump as bad but do check which fits the type of your nipple."
2,It sucks but won't let go!,"I've heard so many rave reviews that when I lost my Purely Yours, I got this one (my son was not nursing so often by then). I was disappointed. My hand hurt from having to squeeze the pump. I guess I should expect that, given that it's a handheld manual pump. Well, I didn't think it would be that tiring. Both my hands were tied up when pumping both sides. The suction was too much. It would release, so I had to let air in every so often so my nipples wouldn't get sucked into the bottle! Well, it wasn't that bad, but it really wouldn't release. The output wasn't what I'd like, either. Maybe I'm just used to the electric variety. This pump would be okay for light pumping but not for working moms."
2,mixed emotions,"Being a mom who will soon have to return to work I looked for the best pump to help me with the process. As if breastfeeding isn't a task of its own it shouldn't be this difficult to express milk. The back to work pump is well equipped with all the necessary essentials: carry case, extra bottles, cool packs, although the pump itself wasn't all it was cracked up to be. With so many raved reviews from friends I was really disappointed with the lack of suction it applied, making a lot of noise and not pumping enough milk for storage. although the price was right it still wasn't worth it.....still in search for a new one any suggestions welcome."
1,Hurt Hurt Hurt - Don't get if you have small nipples,It worked but it pinched so bad I would dread the next feeding and would only pump if absolutely necessary. I finally broke down and bought the Medela mini-electric and it was heaven. I have large breasts with small nearly flat nipples which might be part of the problem. For only about 30 more it is so worth getting the mini-electric.
5,A must have for nursing moms!!,This pump has been wonderful!! With my first child I hated pumping so I never could give her a bottle so I couldn't actually leave weather to run an errand or go on a date with my husband. I was bound to my daughter. Until Avent's Isis I thought it would be the same way with my second child. I tried the Isis and now I can leave the house alone! I love my children but every once in a while it is nice to know it wouldn't be impossible to see a movie.This pump was great!!!! I felt NO pain or discomfort at all. It was so comfortable I can pump very easily and very quickly and now my husband can enjoy feeding my daughter as much as I do. You easily pump into a bottle and with the conveient caps you can store it in the freezer of fridge or just put a nipple on and serve. The case is discrete and the ice packs are small but perfect!!!!
4,I'm giving this 4.5,"This isis breast pump set is great. The only thing I have a problem with is the little noise it makes whenever I pump and it feels not private. Besides that, its very conviencent to use and easy. I think, since its plastic rubbing plastic it just makes the noise after awhile you pump."
3,Not worth the price,"I purchased this instead of the electric pump as I thought it would be helpful for returning to work. However, although it works, mine makes a terrible grinding noise with every hand pump. If I reassemble it, I can sometimes get it to not make the sound, but it typically returns part way through the pumping session. I ended up going back to B-R-Us and purchasing the Easy Comfort Single Breast Pump (which I really like) for only $30 more. Dont' think it is worth $60 (all just plastic pieces and a nice bag, which could all be purchased separately I would guess)"
3,not for every day,"i thought it worked alright it took a while to pump but did the job, that is until it broke. it does come with replacment parts but the part that broke didnt have a replacement. if you are a mom who only pumps on ocassion its great, for every day use.....who's got time. id rather spend the extra money on something that will last and is alot more durable,the avent is a cheap plastic that can crack easily"
2,worked for 2 months,"This only worked for about 2 months, after that, I could only get a couple ounces at each setting even though I am still nursing my child. I do like the bottles and the idea of the pump set. It was discreet enough to take to work and use. But it's too much work to do this even just twice a week. Not recommended"
1,Avent Bottles Contain BPA Bisphenol-A.,"I liked Avent Bottles, my daughter Liked them too! Then I found out about Bisphenol -A being used to make the Bottles. After re-searching Bisphenol -A, I discovered that exposing my baby to harmful chemicals with the potential for long term affects later in life, was definitely not for me!! There are other options out there, all glass bottles are safe, as well as Born Free, Mam by Sassy, Green to Grow and Adrini. Do your own research. I'm really surprised the non Bisphenol -A Free bottles haven't been recalled yet! I'm sure it's just a matter of time, before enough people are educated."
1,Hated this pump!!,"I purchased this pump after reading the reviews and rewards on this brand and style. I did not want to purchase the Medela pump due to its price. It took me two hours to express only 3oz. of milk. I had to remove the petal shield because air was getting thru and my milk was creating too many air pockets causing the milk to clog into the lower part of the pump. The directions even stated that you could remove the petal shield. If I am going to use a product, I would like to be able to use it the way it is described. I pressed down very hard on my breasts to stop the air from coming in but then I got sore nipples and breast tissue.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THE AVENT PUMP. GO BUY THE MEDELA ONE IF YOU ARE GOING TO BE PUMPING FULL TIME."
3,Is a good pump until cracked at the neck...,"I had my baby in Oct. of 2003. I purchased the Avent Isis pump, the first week of my first baby. After returning to work, I didn't have the time (20 to 30 minutes) to pump 8 to 9 oz. At first I didn't want to invest money in buying a expansive pump. Until the pump cracked at the neck, where it connects to the bottle. I started to invest the money in a Medela Pump in Style advanced with backpack. It's a time saving pump and better storage, but not easy to use though."
2,I loved it at first.........,"At first it was perfect, but after 6 months of very sparse use it's neck cracked and I took very good care of it. Then I got the whole thing replaced and 2 weeks later the new one was cracking too and on top of that it's suction totally ....! I had to start using my Medela hospital grade. Also the ice packs only stayed cold for 2 hours, which caused my milk to spoil! Other than the pump, all other Avent products are great! with the exception of minor leakage when it comes to the sippy cups."
1,I cringe every time,"I hate this pump. I dread pumping, but spent so much money, I don't want to go spend more. It is far from gentle, the *comfort* pad hurts, and it is ineffective. I am constantly having to pull my breast out and reset as it either backs up, or it stops pumping. Once I hit a certain amount in the bottle, it won't even pull more milk out of me-- even if I still have plenty.A friend recommeded it, but both I and another friend can't figure out why. She has even more problems with it because she is smaller figured.The only two things that it has going for it are 1) it is easier to pump with one hand than another I have tried, and 2) you can assemble it with one hand if you have a screaming baby and you are engorged to the point where the baby can't even latch on. Other than that, it is worthless."
1,New Mom,"I received this pump as a shower gift and I have to say I don't agree with all of the reviews I read. I was very unhappy with the pump. It broke after only using it three times and the bottles leaked all over my son. I tried using the replacement parts for the pump to see if that would help but it didn't and since I used the product I couldn't return it. I ended up borrowing my friends Medalla (electric pump) and it is great. If you are planning on breastfeeding when you return to work, invest in an electric pump. It takes less time to express milk and it is much more efficient."
1,Don't buy Isis products from Babies R Us !!!,"I purchased this unit and discovered on the small seal, NO REFUND or RETURN. This unit was not suggest to be used for our situation and we needed a motorized unit. So I tried to return the unit at Babies R US, they so read me the print on the stickers and told me to call ISIS. I call and ISIS told me to talk to Babies R US. I call Toy R Us customer service and they told me to to call ISIS.In short I am out $60 due to nobody will accept my return request.Be smart and don't make the same mistake."
4,A fantastic pump for the price,"I was very surprised at how great this little pump was! I have breastfed 2 kids for a year each, and have not been very satisfied with some pumps. For being manual, this was very easy to use and not tiring. Also the ""breast petals"" I found were very natural feeling for stimulating let down. Some electric pumps were very loud and I could never pump well with them despite having quite a lot of milk. I also rented the hospital type pumps while my baby was in the nicu, and those are my favorite, but cost is prohibitive for long term use. I love this one for my occassional pumping needs. I also love the bag and extras for traveling. And you pump right into the bottles, stick a nipple on and your ready to go."
3,Not For the Serious Breastfeeding Mom,"Well, I did my research and bought this pump before my daughter was born. In the beginning this pump was great while I was engorged. I could pump 6 ounces in 10 minutes with great ease. I suggest you stock up in the beginning... Takes 40 minutes to get 2 ounces (baby drinks 4 at one feeding -... My advice: if you plan on breastfeeding for a short period of time this will definitely do the trick, but if you're a mom who is very dedicated to nothing but breast milk (it takes a lot of patience and great determination especially when baby is screaming for food and rejecting the breast) go for a pump-in-style and don't waste the money. You'll be much more successful especially if problems occur."
5,I love this pump :),"My sister-in-law bought me this pump for Christmas. It's been great. It's never hurt to use it, I get a lot of milk fairly quick, and when you get the sterilizer too, its easy to keep clean and ready to use. Nothing is better than having a good pump on hand when you are engorged and baby is sleeping. :)))"
5,Better than an electric and quick and easy to use!,"I have really enjoyed using this pump! I bought the Medela Single Deluxe breastpump, and it was just too noisy and drove my husband nuts. The Avent ISIS works great, and I am able to pump just as much milk in the same amount of time without the noise. The bag allows me to take it anywhere. I love the whole Avent system and not having to pump and dump the milk into another storage bottle is great."
2,Fell apart with only occasional use,"I used this pump for occasional use. I worked one day a week, and pumped once a day when I was home. This pump lost suction, and the pump itself cracked after about 6 or 7 months of use. I found that it did not provide enough suction even when it was working well, and that the parts were too delicate (and I did not ever put them in the dishwasher). I have found that Avent products in general do not stand up to long term, repeated use. I was never able to get more than 3 ounces per session of pumping, and it would've never sustained my milk supply had I been working full time. I am due with my second child in 2 months, and will definitely be buying the Medela Pump in Style this time around (and I should've listened to my other mom friends with the first baby). Their Medela pumps stood up to multiple pumping sessions a day for a year or so and will probably last them through their second children, too."
2,Not a Back to Work Pump,"I purchased this pump because I did not want to spend the money on the Medela pump in style. I used it for the first few months after my son was born and found many drawbacks.First, It has too many parts and is difficult to clean between use.Second, It took me quite a bit of time (45 minutes) to get approximately 3 ounces of milk.Third, it was messy. My milk kept getting behind the petal shield on the pump creating a mess.and the last straw, the plastic part that connects the pump to the bottle cracked and I could not use the pump. At that time I e-mailed Avent because I saw another reviewer have the same problem, but I did not get a return e-mail from Avent!At that point I returned the product to Babies R Us and shelled out the money for the Pump In Style. It was money well spent. My recommendation is if you are planning to go back to work full-time don't even bother with this pump. It is a good pump for a night out once and a while, but not for full-time pumping."
5,I LOVE THIS PUMP,"As a first time mom, I was nervous about the whole pumping idea. I read the reviews on this pump and decided to purchase it before the birth of my son, which was a good thing because I got the last one! The first time I tried to pump I was scared it would hurt (after all the horror stories people were telling me)to my surprise it did not hurt at all, I was amazed at how quickly I was done and the ease of clean up. My son quickly adjusted to the avent nipple/bottles and loves eating with his daddy. He is thriving on both the breast and bottle with no nipple confusion.(we started at 5 weeks)I love this pump. It is discreet and easy to use on the go, I highly recommend this pump. Thank you!"
1,Avent products are inferior,"I received this breastpump as a shower gift with my first child. The only thing I got out of it was a lot of aggravation. The pump would not stay together long enough to get a good suction on the breast. With my second child, I believe I'll try another brand."
2,Takes a while to pump,"I based my decision to purchase this pump based on all the reviews it got. However, it takes me about 20 minutes to pump 4 ounces.. on a good day!! Luckily, I have an awesome boss, who allows me all the time I need to pump.. I average 2-3 ounces every hour and half.. at 20 minutes at a time.. which is rediculous. If I could, I would purchase an electric pump, because as my baby grows, I don't see how I'd be able to catch up to her growing appetite using this pump, and not spend my whole day in the bathroom pumping. On the plus side.. all the litle extras it came with are great, and the case is discreet and keeps the bottles cold for a few hours."
3,Love the pump BOTTLES ARE TRASH!!!!,"I really like this pump. Works great sort of a pain to clean but easier than having to clean tubing on an electric. The bottles however are junk. After one use they leaked from under the plastic disk. EVERY bottle I have leaks. In order to stop it is a pain. I pull up on the nipple and roll it around clockwise to make sure it's in there right, then I use a rubber gripper and tighten the crap out of it so it won't leak. What a PAIN! I sold my lot on ebay and replaced them w/ the Playtex vent air. I did save one bottle so I could pump into it though."
3,So-so,It can be difficult to get started with this pump. Once you achieve letdown it's great but it can take 10-15 minutes to get there. DON'T freeze milk in these bottles - use a bag - they didn't seal properly and the milk went bad.
4,"Great Pump, Great Price!","Being a new mom, who had never breastfed I was nervous when it came to pumping. I registered for this pump after reading it's reviews and using Advent for the rest of my child's feeding needs. This pump worked out wonderful. I had never used an electronic pump before so I can't compare it to one, however; this pump did the job and it did the job in a flash. It's quiet because it's manual, it's fast, and the Isis on the go even comes with a descrete case and cooling packs to keep your expressed milk cold until frozen. It was a great investment....The best part is that it was totally painless."
5,Great for part time pumping,"I bought this pump about 6 weeks after my son was born and I love it. He's 5 months old now and I have used it while working since he was 3 months old without any problems. I have to pump in the ladies room where I work, but this pump is so quiet that no one knows what I'm doing. I work 10 hour shifts, so I pump quite a bit, but this pump is so easy to use that I don't have the hand/wrist pain that I've had with other manual pumps.Overall, the bag is stylish and discreet, the bottles are fabulous (no nipple confusion problems) and I have not had any problems with any part of it. The only thing I would suggest to someone looking to purchase one of these is to acquire additional ice packs if you can't keep your milk in the fridge. I had to buy two more solid ice packs to keep my milk cold all day. Otherwise, I have no complaints. Excellent product and service."
2,Put the $60 towards an electric pump!,"If you are only going to be pumping once in a blue moon, then this is a great pump for you. I found it to be an incredible nusance, so I borrowed a friend's Medela electric pump. Never used this Back to Work pump more than twice after using hers! Why spend a longer amount of time pumping that you have to (and yes it does take longer even though the manual says their stats say otherwise). With our next child, I will definitely be buying electric!"
2,too slow,"I had no problems with breastfeeding and was hardly ever away from my daughter so I didn't think I would need a more expensive electric pump. This Isis was so slow to use, that it was easier to just stay home or take the baby with me than to express milk - it took less time to breastfeed her than it did to pump a feed. also you need good muscles in your hands and if you try to pump fast will damage your nipples. I am pregnant again and ready to invest in an electric pump. I found this thing a waste of time."
2,Not a good pump if planning to work,I brought this pump because I wanted something easy to use so i could give my baby breastmilk while i was at work. While i was home for the first three months it work great and i really like it but then it started to leak and broke apart. I fixed it and used it a couple of times after that. When i went back to work and it took about 20-30 minutes to pump and my wrist hurt when i was finished. I then decided to buy the Medela which i love i went from taking 20-30 to get 4oz to 10-15 minutes getting 9-10 ozs. Its a great pump if you plan on using it only a few times but if your working it a waste of money.
3,"For my first pump, works great! Could be more durable ....","For the first pump I've purchased, it works fine, though I have nothing to compare to. I've had it a few months and use it about once a day. Up until recently, its held up.. The problem I have now is the plastc neck piece that screws on broke. It started out as a hairline crack then progressed. The plastic isn't very durable for repeated longterm use... Now I'm debating on what to buy next... I will say it pumps fine and fast..."
4,Worked great!,"I used this pump for nine months,and it was wonderful! Very easy to use and everything hooked on nicely,I loved that everything had it's own little place in the bag. I also was able to hook up a Playtex bottle to it as well, which was nice because that's what I used!! =)"
5,Pump actually beats 2 other pumps I had,"This pump beats Evenflo Single Battery/Electric ... and Evenflow Personal Comfort Double Pumping Electric Kit ...! Since it's manual too, it will never let you down like the others did. Flower petal covering horn doesn't work too well for me though. Easy to clean. I like the disposable bags set too."
4,Great for mom who occasionally pumps,"I exclusively breastfed my baby, even when returning to work part-time. I used this pump before returning to work, and while I was working. Indeed, I was able to keep a steady supply of milk for my baby for some time. But by the time she was 6 months old, my milk supply began to decrease and this pump just couldn't stimulate my letdown anymore. I had to give up pumping entirely. Luckily, I only leave my baby for a few hours a week.This pump is great for moms who need to occasionaly pump, but i would not recommend it for anyone who needs to do a lot of pumping."
4,Works perfect with me :),"I love my Isis. A friend bought it to me as a gift and I use it everyday. First it was a little hard, but it was only because my milk wasn't coming out at all. But after my production started, the pump started to work perfectly. Highly recommended :)"
2,Still can't get it to work,"First off, I love the avent bottles and everything else that came in the package. However, I guess the suction is poor or I did not assemble it properly because as hard as I squeeze, I can't get it to work. I got the manual Medela pump from the hospital and it's perfect. The electric Medela pump is good also but it hurts more. So I prefer the manual Medela pump unless I could figure out the avent pump.Second baby, two years later and decided to give the Avent Pump another try but to no avail. My breasts aren't that small, about a size B, but still no suction. I'm still going to use the Medela. What a waste of money! I give it two stars because everything else, even the bag was better than the pump but they don't help me get the milk."
2,What am I doing wrong???,"With so mant great reviews, I am sure I am doing something wrong! I love the case and accessories but I cannot get decent suction to pump any milk. My husband and I have rechecked assembly and all parts to make sure it is working as it was intended but still nothing. Please, someone, tell me what I'm doing wrong - I really want to love this pump!"
3,Works great (5 stars) until it breaks (1 star),"I purchased the Avent Isis pump, after having my first baby in Feb. 2002 and was amazed at how comfortable it was to use. Shortly before returning to work, I decided to also invest the money (!!!) in a Medela Pump-In-Style (a little harder to use, not hands free, but faster, easier to clean and better milk storage) because while the Isis pump worked well, it would take me 15-20 minutes per breast to pump a total of 8-9 oz.I continued to use the Isis for short outings or as a backup. Until the pump cracked at the neck, where it connects to the bottle. Before I decided to check the B-R-US customer reviews, I thought it may have been 'operator' error, but apparently it is a defect. I have yet to find the time to contact them for a replacement/refund (which will probably crack again).One tip to anyone else that has both these products - the Isis petal insert fits on the Medela pump too."
4,Different than what I thought,"Starting out I didn't quite know what to expect. At time it is fast paced and then it slows down to a crawl. The ""Hero"" is sometimes believable and other times he isn't. There seemed a lot of be sad for me in this book, because my dad, wife, son, and friends were killed by werewolves. The hero kind a reminded me of Forrest Gump. It is a good read but like I said at times it slows to a crawl. I would recommend it though if you like werewolves."
4,"A guy's book, but good","It mixes mountain-man/indian lore with James Bond and crime show type action. Even a western-like bar room showdown. Lots of action and gore with a tortured hero who, while doing a lot of killing, manages to stay decent at heart- though it's a near thing. I will read the sequel."
2,"Writing wanders all over, hard to follow.","Really was hoping this would be better. It wanders around, is hard to follow, and really just isn't written very well. The action scenes just aren't described where you can follow anything.I basically think a werewolf attacks him than he shoots it, and it is dead. That is literally how it is written."
5,More real than Twilight,"I loved the character in the book. He is likeable and realistic. The story flowed nicely, though it did seem to go on forever, but seeing as how I didn't want it to end it was all good."
4,A Man's Book,"Autobiography of a Werewolf Hunter seemed to me (a woman) to be a man's book. Several times I wanted to put the book down and not read any more. Several times I DID skip portions that became too hard to read.The emphasis was on action adventure and surviving difficult situations (Vietnam; prison). Though the protagonist had love interests, they were not really ""fleshed out"". This story was man against other men; man against demons (werewolfs); and eventually man against himself. The ending was hopeful -- that he would become a more whole person than one focused on ""the enemy"".Ultimately glad that I read it. A rather complex story and an entertaining read."
4,Entertaining read!,"I enjoyed the book a lot and recommend it. Face paced action, I look forward to reading the next one."
2,High Expectations Weren't Met,"I bought this with high expectations based on all the great reviews. Personally, I found this book to be too boring to finish. It started off promising, but went on and on with little werewolf encounters. I was hoping for more werewolves, not insight into the Vietnam war and life in prison. Maybe if this were my first werewolf book, I would have been more impressed. I forced myself to get as far as half way, but stopped. I did skip to the end just to see how it all turned out. I hate to be one of the few people that doesn't like this, but it's my personal opinion. Very disappointed."
4,Well Written,"This was a very well written book. I enjoyed it for the most part. My only complaint, and this is just me, is that it is extremely detailed. The author seems to go on for pages describing small details. Other than that I have nothing bad to say about this book or the author."
5,"Great characters, action, dialogue, & story",I've always liked the werewolf. Easton does a great job. I hope a screenplay comes from this or even a television series.
4,Falls apart in the last 70 pages,"If the last 70 pages had been more satisfying this would be 5 stars, easy. But, as it stands we have a disappointing climax, a weak ending for most of the main characters and an unnecessarily long denouement. On the plus side, the werewolves are cool, described as massive, vicious, demonic remorseless monsters, and there's an interesting werewolf hierarchy that's unique to this book. It also violent, and action packed, with a good story and interesting first person narrative. I did find the main character to be a bit cliche, but he was still filled with monkeys. All and all, a good bleak, violent, gritty horror novel/character piece. Recommended for fans of werewolf fiction."
3,Interesting Story Line,This book took more turns than i thought it would but it had a nice characterization to it. I just wish there would have been more life between James and Tanya.
2,A soldier-of-fortune book,This is definitely a GUY'S book--it is not at all what I thought it was going to be--very violent and vulgar at times.
5,"Werewolves scare me, now.","The werewolf genre is a tired one, and authors are always trying to re-vitalize it with their interpretations. When The Autumn Moon Is Bright succeeds at this, but not in the way you'd imagine. Instead of focusing on the werewolves so much the reader becomes numb to them, this book shows you what its like to be their victim, which presents the werewolf as a horrifying creature. The story's settings and descriptions are so real and so accurate, that it lulls the reader into a place of safety until the werewolves shows up. It's kind of like having dinner at home and having one of these monsters come crashing through your door. It's that potent! I couldn't put it down. I recommend When The Autumn Moon Is Bright to anyone who's been waiting for a novel that truly breathes new life into the genre, and if you're a werewolf lover like I am, YOU HAVE TO READ THIS!"
4,It was decent.,"This book was compelling and well written, but not quite 5 star material. Too many slow parts. It was still interesting and gives a very real look into what could be a true werewolf hunters life. Definitely not a book for young kids. A lot of intense and gory scenes."
3,Could Have Been Better,This book started out promising but dropped off for awhile and I skipped a section because it dragged on. It felt unnecessary to the story as a whole to me. It picks up again later but wasn't as good as I thought it would be. There is a second book but I have no desire to read it.
5,"An amazing story, filled with twists and turns.","I bought this novel after seeing all the positive reviews on Amazon after I got a Kindle for Christmas. I'm extremely glad that I did. The novel starts off quickly and continues at a breakneck speed until the very end. The protagonist has a main goal in mind, but keeps himself busy hunting werewolves in other cities. From Canada, to Vietnam, to New Orleans, to the mid-west, we travel along on a quest for revenge. If you've just purchased a Kindle, make sure this book is one of your very first purchases. With a full sequel out, and a third on the way, it looks like there will be plenty of legends hunted in the future."
5,amazing,I'm a long time fan of werewolf books and have read many of them and I have to say this is the best one. So many twist and turns ups and downs. Goes from super exciting to heart breaking in few few sentences and then brings you back to life with amazing story telling .... most read for werewolf fans
4,A Helpful Guide to Survival,"Teaches survival skills. Basic survival like how to use a compass. To Building a survival shelter and how to tie good Knots. Basic First Aid. It also teaches you to identify trees,birds,and plants."
3,a little bit of everything,"This book looks as if the author has cut out articles from other books and pasted them in his own. It has informations for nearly every outdoor question you might come up with, but leaves you alone when it comes to details. Nevertheless if you have children this might be the perfect book for an adventurous youth. It somehow reminds me on the famous boy scout book of Donald Duck's nephews. Otherwise if you are serious into camping and/or survival buy an other book."
5,Terrific,"This is the best, most comprehensive manual for outdoor survival we've ever seen. Highly recommended! Photos and illustrations make this foolproof."
5,Camping and Wilderness,I have purchased 5 of these. The best book on the market if you can find them. They are better than most Boy Scout material. I have given these to Scoutmasters for review and use. They are used a lot.
4,Very interesting,"I love this book because i've always told myself that I could live in the mountains and survive on my own. This book can tell you if you could. Have you ever wondered what would happen if you were stranded somewhere without communication or civilization, what would you do, would you know the plants you can and can't eat. How to cook what ever you are able to find to eat. Just how to survive without Wal-Mart. This book will tell you everything you need to know. This book is great for adult and teens alike. If a war errupted on our home land and you had to run and hide in the caves and mountains in your area could you make due. This book will show you and explain how you can do just that."
5,T2 greatest multi-game evar!!,"T2 is not the largest game out there, but it has the best community BY FAR! many counterstrike players try T2 and complain and leave because it actually requires skill. competition gameplay is anywhere from 7 to 14 people on each team practicing each day for hours at a time, and coordinating on voice-communication programs. Standard gameplay is Capture the flag. competition ladders and forums on www.teamwarfare.com and a huge IRC community at irc.dynamix.com if you got the time, and the patience, there is no other game like T2."
5,this great game is free to download online,"people still play this game and it's now being supported by a large fanbase because it's a truly great game that people love, for good reason. Check it out.[...]"
3,avoid if at all possible.,"This game isn't worth the hassle! From experiences, patches are not tested correctly and introduce more bugs with every release. In addition to the bugs, you are required to reinstall the game everytime a new patch is released.Instead of focusing a solid game, Sierra decided to point fingers at your computer configuration which work fine with every other game but theirs. If you enjoy spending hours trying to fix sierra's mess, by all means buy this game, otherwise avoid it at all cost."
2,Lacks Focus,"The Astors are an iconic American family, rising from immigrant roots to great wealth and aristocratic pretensions, undermined by their own social ambition and self-imposed isolation and finally, in later generations, fading from economic and social prominence. (104 year-old Brooke Astor, the widow of Vincent, is the last multi-millionaire Astor, and will leave no Astor heirs.) Yet this book purports to be, not about the Astors, but about the great hotels that they conceived and built, including such landmarks as the old Waldorf-Astoria, The Astor and the St. Regis. As such, the book lacks focus and is poorly integrated; it's not quite a bio of the Astors, since it's character portraits are superficial, but it's not really about the great hotels either, because it limits that story to the role played by the Astors. The result is disjointed and, occasionally, boring. This author knows alot about the Astors and would have done better to write a straightforward biography or family history."
3,"Readable, but offers little","Kaplan uses some stilted sentence structures, but the book is readable. It was a fairly good introduction to the topic, but after reading it I don't feel that I learned a great deal about the Astors, the Waldorf-Astoria or New York culture during the time of the Astors - topics that I hoped I would have a sense of after reading the book. Be that as it may, it is a short book and it would have been difficult to sufficiently cover the topic in as many pages."
4,Hotel Mania,"This book, while initially giving the impression of being a recounting of the Astor family, actually turns into a history of hotels in New York City built by wealthy people. As a biography it was well done, but as a history of the hotels it is extremely interesting. There are some asides about the inter-family feuds of the Astors, and it mentions, in passing, the death of John Jacob IV on the Titanic (perhaps more should have been said about this). To those interested in the early history of New York, and its famous hotels, this is required reading!"
3,Mostly history,"Book was not what I expected. Does not delve into characters,but more or less who begot who and rivalries, hotel building, and so on. If you're looking for character development or revelation, this is not what you want."
2,Reservations,This is a very slim read that inspired me to read other books on the same and similar subjects. However the Astors are not as interesting as the Vanderbilts.
4,When the Astors Owned New York,"Very enjoyable reading. I would wish for better illustrations but, then that would have uped the price so it seems like a good compromise."
2,Boring,This book is boring. I did not finish this book. I will donate this book to a book fair soon.
1,Astor biography,Very boring. Not much information about the Astors. And only a lttle about the time of the century. Waste of money.
5,When the Astors Owned New York,"The book tells the story of the enormous wealth of the Astors at a time referred to as The Gilded Age. Money insulated them from ordinary concerns, but problems still beset them. This was an interesting read about the glory and challenges they faced."
1,NYC parents beware!!!,"This Mattress is not the solution for NYC living (or for those who live in small spaces). It is only great for temporary use and travel use. I live in Manhattan where my husband and I share a bedroom with our son. We have the Delta Portable crib (wooden). It seems a 2 -3 inch foam mattress covered in noisy, annoying vinyl is the only option available to fit this size crib. Since this is my son's regular bed I have searched high and low for a regular 5"" spring mattress in this size, but he is nearly a year now and I am still looking. I don't want a 'skinny, easy to fold up with the crib' mattress, I want a 'huge, honkin I don't move my crib' mattress. I now sleep on the couch so I am not awakened by the sound of a baby moving around on vinyl all night."
5,A must have for ALL porta cribs.,"For 20 bucks, this mattress is a beyond basic need for today's porta-cribs. The ""mattress"" which comes with standard porta-cribs are only about an inch thick lying flat on wood board base. It was pathetic. I saw what my crib came with and thought 'NO WAY AM I LETTING MY NEWBORN SLEEP ON THAT.'We found this mattress and it was several inches thick and has a vinyl covering which makes it stain-proof. You can also get a mattress pad.I love this mattress and for the money, it is a great investment. No parent should really have a porta-crib without an additional mattress."
5,No more tired baby,"This find was a godsend. My 21 month old finally got some sleep at our lake house and was not unbearable to live with at the end of the weekend. He slept from 7:30p to 8a every night and woke up with out crying. He was finally comfortable sleeping in his Pack and Play. It fit perfectly. The sheet I had bought for the Pack and Play ""mattress"" fit perfectly as well. I would recommend this gem to anyone with a portable crib."
3,re use with a travelin tot garden safari playpen,"The 4-n-1 Travelin Tot playpen in Garden Safari is what we chose to use in place of a bassinet because the top of the playpen works just as a bassinet does, but we can use a playpen for much longer so we found this option to be much more practical. Problem...the padding in the bottom of the bassinet portion of the playpen is rock hard. We found this mattress and it appeared to be the perfect solution to the problem, but when we put it inside to make sure it was a perfect fit, it wasn't. If the mattress moves all the way to one side of the playpen, it leaves a gap plenty large enough for a baby to roll into and suffocate. The only solution we could come up with was to roll up blankets and place along each side of mattress making it a snug fit in the bassinet.Don't like this solution much at all, but sometimes you have to improvise and it beats the rock hard padding that came with the playpen."
4,"Good advice, but requires work to follow","Mr. Campbell has written a clear, easy-to-read, and concise book on how to time your local real estate market so you can know when to buy or sell for the most profit. However, following the steps in his book will require that you spend some time and energy locating and tracking the 5 monthly statistics for your market which need to be tracked in order for you to tell when you are at a market peak (time to sell), or a market bottom (time to buy): Existing home sales, building permits, foreclosures, interest rates, etc. must all be tracked if you are going to follow what he calls The Campbell Method. Still, if you're serious about saving or making tens of thousands of dollars which are readily available to anyone willing to take the time, you'll do what he says."
1,Too bad it shrinks.,"I love the idea of a cover for the changing pad, and the material is nice, but after following the washing instructions as printed on the label, it shrank after the first wash, rendering it completely useless. Too bad."
4,Works well on contoured pad....,I have had this from the day my daughter came home from the hospital and it has held up in the wash. No major accidents on it but the few there were are due to my not folding up the stinky diapers all the way or her spitting up. Washes well and never shrunk for me. If you are washing it on warm your water temp may be too high(hot water heater) so that may be causing it to shrink. I love mine and it is softer now then first use and it is secure so she does not slide like when we tried a towel on the changing pad.Have had the same 2 since February and look like new. Would have given this 5 stars but this is not as soft as I had hoped...maybe expecting alot from terry cloth.
2,Just extra laundry!,"I got this when my baby was born and used it about 4 times. Now it is just sitting in my closet with the rest of the linens. It seemed like every time I used it my very newborn son would have a bowel movement or urinate between diaper changes. It never seemed to make it through more than one diaper change and it was in the laundry more than it was on my changing pad. Soon, I realized I was just creating more work for myself as the changing pad had a wipeable surface and was much easier to clean. The changing pad on it's own is plenty comfortable and I just use a clorox wipe for accidents and I have one less piece of dirty laundry to contend with. Maybe now that he is older and has far fewer ""in between diapering accidents"" it would be better, but I have no interest in trying."
5,Need more of these covers,"The ONLY thing I have to say about these covers is I should have bought more than 2 of them. They are WONDERFUL, but my daughter seems to mess up 2 in one day (by peeing quickly before I can get the next diaper on her).I'm going back and ordering two more right now..."
3,the covers are almost pointless,"other than supplying warmth for your babies skin, its useless. theres nothign wrong with the cover itself, its actually a good one because it feels like a towel, problem is, (especially if you have a boy) it gets dirty before you have a chance to even really use it. without the cover, you can give your baby a sponge bath right there on the pad, and clean up any mess easy, with the cover, it just ends up in the wash every other day. like someone else mentioned though, there is no slit in the side for the straps on the new pads..."
3,Good but not Great!,"We got this for our contoured changing pad. It is very comfortible for our daughter to lie on. My reasoning for giving it 3 starts is two-fold. 1. After a few washes and dries, it does not fit as well on the changing pad, and 2. There are no slots on the bottom for the safety belt.It does do the job, but I think it could be designed a little better."
1,Terry Contoured changing pad cover,"These covers are horrible! I have gone through 3 of them in 2 years, Every time you wash it the cover feels more and more rough and looks like it's falling apart. I thought Terry cloth would be much softer but it feels more like sandpaper, this last one I have is only 5 months old and it looks like I've had it for 5 years! It also doesn't fit the contoured changing pad at all, I have to stuff the pad in the cover and then smoothe it flat and the corners are smooshed in. I have no choice but to use the cover , my daughter hates being on a cold changing pad!"
3,"fits fine, but so rough & scratchy","We haven't had any shrinkage problems, but the terry material isn't soft at all. Even when it's machine-dried, it's stiff and rough as if it were line-dried.The pad's safety straps stick out easily enough from under the edges of the cover, but since they are from the same manufacturer it really was poorly designed."
3,It doesn't fit,"I love how comfortable the changing pad cover seems for my baby to lay on. However, everyone is right - it does not fit the Simmons changing pad properly. I struggle to get it on every time and end up bending the changing pad to squeeze it in. This would be a great product if it fit properly."
1,Just use disposables,"Upon advice of a friend, I am returning my two unused covers. Since I had baby I have been using disposable changing pads. You will be surprised how many/how often accidents happen...during just one diaper change! I would be washing between each change if I were using these covers! So much for saving the environment! So I have found disposable changing pads are the best. You don't throw them out if they're still clean, but in the event of an accident, you aren't running to the washing machine trying to scramble for a clean pad. Don't waste your time, money, water, or soap!"
5,Perfect changing pad cover!!!,I purchased this changing pad for my first grandchild's nursery. We were all excited about the news and were eager to have the nursery in order for the arrival. I was very pleased with the changing pad cover. It was exactly what I was looking for and it fits the changing pad perfectly.
3,Not to happy with the fitting!!!,"I bought this changing pad cover thinking that by going by the measurements they would fit my changing pad, but NOT. It is so hard to get it to fit on the changing pad you have to really pull and stretch it out to its max to get it to fit and it barely fits. I don't recommend this item at all."
2,"Shrinks with cold wash, delicate cycle","I do agree with other reviewers who found this product to shrink after washing. I bought two of these and returned them both because there was shrinage after washing in cold water, delicate cycle, and drying with extra low heat. There is a much better cover that I found at another store, which has taken a lot of repeated washing and drying, as a changing pad cover should"
1,Too Small,"Can't put it in simpler terms. It does not fit my standard changing table pad, not by a long shot."
2,Not good!,"I just washed this cover and put it on the Simmons pad for the first time. It either shrunk in the wash or did not fit to begin with. I would think that since Simmons makes the cover AND the changing pad that they might be compatible - but there are no holes to thread the safety straps through... and the tag on the changing pad says ""child... should always be restrained with the safety straps"". So they are not even supporting their own 'safety' standards.So now I can't use the 'so important' safety straps unless I get out the sewing machine and make giant button holes, but the cover is too small anyway and practically bends the pad in two. It won't sit flat on the dresser... just adding to the lack of safety!! Just an FYI, the cover actually fits better on the 'Especially for baby' pad - which comes with a knit fabric cover for about the same price."
2,The incredible shrinking changing pad cover........,"what gives?? This thing gets smaller every time I wash it. If I can muster the strength to force it over the ends of my changing pad, it causes the pad to fold up like a taco. Ridiculous!"
2,Not well made.,"I bought two of these. On the first wash, one of them ripped. The terry cloth looks like it's shredding and separated from the elastic. The cloth also has many ""pulls"". I haven't even had my baby yet, and I have to return this product. It looked like a great product, but it needs to be better constructed. Very disappointing!"
3,"Not the best, but all there is","I purchased these covers because there doesn't seem to be anything else to fit the contoured changing pad. Even after just one washing, the cover already shrunk. I washed in cold water and dried on low since I had read the reviews saying they would shrink. It didn't help, they still shrunk. They still work though, but the corners of the changing pad are crumched down. I don't see the problem with the straps either. Mine are attached to the bottom of the pad, so there is no need for any slits for them. Overall, these covers serve their purpose, and that's about all. I would definitely suggest covering your changing pag with SOMETHING so that all the yuck doesn't get down into all the little crevices of the pad. You might prefer covering the pad with a receiving blanket, so you can easily toss it in the washer with no worries when it becomes soiled."
1,A Terrible Fit for the Simmons Pad,"I love my contured Simmons changing pad but I do not like the cover at all. THEY SHRINK. With every wash, the covers have gotten smaller and smaller. The changing pad curves in the middle with the covers on them. The covers are expensive and should not shrink when they are washed. Save your money. Use receiving blankets instead."
2,Not so hot,"This cap doesn't snug up around the face, so your hairline gets wet. The vinyl is stiff, so it scratches my face. I'm still looking for a new shower cap."
3,"Worth reading, but not great","It is good, but not great. If you like sailing stories, it will be a nice addition to your collection. I would recommend Kon Tiki by Thor Heyerdahl, Adrift by Steven Callahan and Tinkerbelle by Robert Manry. Tinkerbelle is one of my favorites, if you can find a copy. Dove by Robin Graham is another sailing book that I would recommend. I enjoyed 40,000 Miles in a Canoe, but I have read better sailing books."
1,Very Unsatisfied!,I was very unsatisfied with this product. All I could pick up was a lot of static. I was in the room right next to my baby & it was so staticky I couldn't hear a thing! I also picked up phone conversations. I would not advise any one to buy this product unless you live very far away from your neighbors.
3,somewhat disappointed,"I chose this monitor based on several reviews I had seen. At first, I was very pleased with the performance. My daughter is 4 months old now, and in the last month or so, I have experienced A LOT of static with the monitor. It is very sensitive to noises which I like; however, if I turn it up above level ""1,"" the static is overwhelming. I would hesitate to recommend this monitor to other parents."
1,This is so horrible please DO NOT BUY IT!,"1 is too many stars for the product! toooooooooooooooo much static, and broken after 2 months, it's just a waste of money, so do yourselves a favor and just don't buy it ..."
4,A cool adventure.,"A nice adventure story filled with suspense. At this rate, Pike is the best children's book seller. I agree with [whoever] said the witch's background should be revealed to us, but anyway i adore the witch more than anyone else and she is one of the reasons i buy Spooksville-to know more about her. I took away a star coz i didnt feel the book was very scary."
4,It was exciting and kept you paying attention,"I think this book was very good, it made you wonder what would happen to Cindy,Adam,Watch,and Sally."
3,"Good reference, unbalanced presentation","This book is a must-have for anyone serious about audio technology and sound reproduction. Almost all imaginable subjects are covered, making it an excellent reference.The problem with this book, though, is that it is a collection of articles (""chapters"") written by various experts around the world. It appears however that no effort was made by the editor to get spread and depth of content in line. For example, the chapter on transformers is very detailed, with good references at the end, yet the chapter on amplifiers is very weak and gives no references whatsoever.Also, this book appears to be more written towards the recording community, and covers only a few topics relative to live sound reinforcement. Finally, there is virtually no discussion on sound effects processors."
4,Air Power Dusters,"I feel that the 6 pack of the power air dusters are good quality, very good price & quick service!"
3,"Ok, would not buy again",I am giving this 3 stars for the following reasons:Pros:Fast shippingDecent priceCons:Weak air pressure! Seems like they are almost empty when you get them. Other air dusters I've used a much more powerful.
2,Stops working very quickly,"These get cold very quickly and then air doesn't come out until it warms up again. The price was attractive, but they're only good for 30 seconds at a time."
3,"got 6, but it does have bitterant","I did get 6 cans, but it does have a bitterant so be aware of that when using it! If you're going to be using it in the same room as open food or beverage, you might consider one of the bitterant free brands."
5,It's compressed air...,and there's not a lot more to say other than this price was significantly lower that what I could have bought it for locally.
5,6 pack,"I use compressed air to clean the fan on my laptop. I love that I could get six cans of compressed air. I have not had the opportunity to use the comparessed yet, but I am happy that I have the air for when my laptop acts up."
2,Fragile tops -,"make this a PITA to use.OK I dropped one and it broke, but another top came off when I pressed down to use it.The air stram seems fine but I expect I'll need kid gloves to get all the air out before the can breaks."
5,Exactly what you expected and wanted,"For the most part, these air power dusters are exactly like all compressed air in a can. I've noticed the air dusters have plenty of compressed air and hold up to any and all brands I have used. Perhaps what I would consider a positive above the average compressed air can is that the entire can does not freeze up as quick as other brands which is why I would recommend and purchase again."
5,Powerful Air,The package arrived promptly with all of the cans and I believe each one came with its own straw attachment. The air power was significant and definitely cleaned my laptop fans well; my overheating problems have now disappeared.
3,air duster 6 pack,"It works, should have gotten mine at wal-mart. IT's lot cheaper there. But, I haven't shopped there in a long time, and didn't know they sold it. It works, if you hate shopping, this will work for you."
2,Only thing going for it is it's price,"After moderate use, the can gets cold. when the can gets cold, the air pressure weakens drastically. after a couple minutes of use, i was barely getting a breeze out of it, and my hands were freezing!"
2,Air Power,"On my first use of this product, the top (spray unit) came off. I put it back on. Then removed the little safety catch on top -- as is directed. When I tried to operate it, the top came off again. Put it back on. Toyied with it and found if I press down on top (and to the front) it would shoot the air out. Tried a second container with the same results. This product is faulty. Trying to determine if I want to return it. I will not buy this again.Air Power Dusters Quantity: 6 per Pack"
1,"bad product .work bad , no power n suck","soft blow , can not blow anything. it a waste of buck.i used it to clean my computer and soft blow came out n out very fast.one last word ; suck;"
4,Good Product,"Use for this product is for electronic devises dusting, and primarily for work in my jewelry creation lab for cutting and faceting gems and finishing job...does a good job would prefer a 12oz container as opposed to 10oz, other than that good product for my work."
5,Air Power Dusters,The air power dusters were just as described. Good item price and I would purchase it again in the future.
3,Will not place a second order for these power dusters,I was happy with the service and the time it took to receive my product from this company. I was not pleased with the product itself since it does not have the same pressure behind the airflow that I am used to and it stops working before I have the job done.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0008GMHEI/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_img
1,Denying the suffering of Christians,"Denying the suffering of Christians under Moslem rule is what Said wants the West to do. The denial of Christian suffering by Christians who lived among Moslems is a phenomenon that is always overlooked. As Christians who live in Egypt, neither Said nor I could marry a Moslem woman unless we convert to Islam; as Christians neither Said nor I would be allowed entrance to some Arab cities; as Christians, neither Said nor I would be allowed to build a church without permission from the President of Egypt. Why is Said quiet about that?"
2,Original aspect ratios?,"As with the first three movies in this series, the four in this set are a mixed bag in the humor department.They are nicely transfered by Universal, however, with one exception.....according to the imdb.com database, ""Ma and Pa Kettle at Waikiki"", made in 1955, had an aspect ratio of 1.85:1. WHY, OH WHY, would Universal release a ""Franchise Collection"" in other than the OAR????????This seems to be a bad marketing trend by many of the movie companies when it comes to family oriented movies (i.e., ""The Trouble With Angels"" and ""Where Angels Go Trouble Follows""). Let's hope the movie companies soon realize that the viewers of these older movies are mostly adults who want their movies all in one piece."
2,Ma and Pa Kettle,"Not as good as I had remembered, but funny in parts. The themes of ""scamming"" and ""conning"" of others to get something for free doesn't ring well with me. But this is my personal opinion. There are still many funny scenes and this can be enjoyable in portions."
4,The Adventures of Ma & Pa Kettle - Volume 2,"I really enjoyed this DVD. These old black & white movies had to depend upon the story and the actors, not special effects. This DVD is very good; however, the movies are not arranged in the order that they were released. All in all, I would buy more Ma & Pa Kettle movies, if they make more DVD's."
5,The adventures of Ma & Pa Kettle,"great series. No sex, murder or mayhem. Just alot of laughs and happy endings."
4,HOwdy!,Good ole Ma and Pa Kettle. I used to love to watch them on Saturdays when I was a kid. STill fun to watch if you like the old stuff. I sure wished there was more to this DVD though.
5,"fun, fun, fun","If you need a diversion from all the horrible news on CNN and the networks, if the weather is cloudy and gray for the umpteenth day in a row, if you are tired of modern comedies trying too hard to make you laugh, settle back and enjoy some gentle smiles and a couple of silly, belly laughs with Ma & Pa Kettle. Life can be, was, could be just as simple and easy as they made it - no one gets hurt and there is still truly a bit of them in us, whether we want to admit it or not. My mother saw these films with her grandparents, I have shared ""The Egg and I"" with my husband and our nieces love sitting back with popcorn and being silly (Old-fashioned style)."
5,Laugh Fest,I have always like the Ma and Pa Kettle movies and when I could buy four movies on one disc I jumped at the chance. Never a disappoiintment. Always fun to watch.
4,Just What You Expect,"Good ol' Ma & Pa Kettle - these silly movies are a low-stress way to spend an evening in front of your screen. The quality of the recording is really good and there are the trailers, which are interesting to watch. I have loved these movies since I saw a few of them in a ""nostalgia theater"" (one that plays old movies) and now it's good to have them for myself. If you can sit down after a stressful day and let your mind enjoy some silly entertainment, it's always good to spend that time with the Kettles. Heck, you might be much obliged for the smiles."
5,great memories,"I recommend this series to anyone who loves laughes. Also, get vol 1 as well. Have brought much joy and quality time with family and friends."
1,Proof not in the patch,"Very dissatisfied...there were no results. The patches were very difficult to stay in place after applied. In order to properly wrap/apply to a thigh, you must buy @ least 2-3 boxes. Just not he product for me...a total waste of money & time."
2,Patch does not work!,"Does not stick properly, keeps falling off. Only a slight cool feeling on the skin. Do not really help in reducing cellulite."
4,Cliffs Nortes - Les Miserables,"I may be unique in this, but what I did was read each summary section in the Cliffs Notes and then read the corresponding section in the unabridged novel. The notes actually made it easier to understand what was written in the book. I don't know whether I'd recommend this as a general technique, but I've done this with several other books and it has always worked out well for me."
5,Better than all you can ever say,This is the best book I have ever read. Victor Hugo is a very good and interesting writer!Castor Junior
1,Star junk,"I got this movie a few years ago because I collect Joe Lara movies. He was best in Gunsmoke Last Apache and American Cyborg. Star Fire Mutiny was a complete bomb. It was utter space junk.I had to watch this movie several times to get the point and to be honest, I never really quite got it other than the usual psycho wanting something. There was wooden acting, no recognizable script, and Joe was mercifully 'unconscous' during most of it. Now that really rubbed me the wrong way. Joe looks so tough but he got knocked out for the most of the film so there was no point because I got it to see him. I also wasn't too thrilled seeing him for a second movie with short hair. Joe looks his best in his trademark long hair and thank goodness since this movie was made he's grown his hair back.The end intrigued me where Joe has that blond as his wife and a kid on that planet that they're starting over on. Gee, really wish Joe would get married and have kids. They would be so good looking."
5,doesn't get any better!!!!!,amazon saves me money. i wanted this product in a 3.5 pound contained; when amazon suggeste i could save more by buying a 20 pound container. since i have two parrots and love the product i did purchase the bigger quantity. thanks for caring amazon. will continue to shop with your company
5,NUTRI-BERRIES REVIEW,I'VE BEEN PURCHASING NUTRI-BERRIES FOR PARROTS IN THE 3.25LB SIZE FOR $23.00.MY PARROT GOES THROUGH ONE OF THESE CONTAINERS IN 2 WEEKS. SHE'S SPOILED AND WON'T EAT ANYTHING ELSE. PETSMART DOESN'T CARRY ANY LARGER SIZE SO I HAD TO LOOK TO AMAZON.I WAS AMAZED TO FIND THAT AMAZON HAD IT AND WITH SHIPPING I PAID $102. IT ARRIVED IN ABOUT 4 DAYS. I TRANSFERRED THE CONTENTS TO 5 EMPTY CONTAINERS THAT I SAVED. I STACK THEM CONVENIENTLY AND THEY SHOULD LAST ME ABOUT 3 MONTHS.I'M HAPPY WITH THE PURCHASE AND THE DELIVERY. NOW I DON'T HAVE TO GO TO THE PET STORE AND BE FRUSTRATED THAT THEY'RE OUT OF STOCK
3,Does not work well with Vista,"Kids absolutley love the game, but getting it to work on a newer computer is a pain. If you have an older machine running Windows 95/98 I highly recommend this software. If you have a newer machine you can get it to run but it takes work and it is not stable. When running on Vista there is no way to exit the program from most screens, so you have the use CTRL-ALT-DEL and shut the software down in the task manager. If you try to run the software in ""Personalized Mode"" it does not seem to work at all. If there is a newer version I would recommend that for newer machines. Once you get it running your kids will love it."
4,you cant find a more spesific book on propeller design.,"Firstly i must relate you about its characteristics that the most important one is how lage knowledge it has. The language, be used in writing the book, is so hard to understand easily for a person who doesn't know english very well. That's why you will be urged in understanding what something is about when you use thia book."
4,"Works, but won't wake from sleep w/ Mass Storage Devices attached...","Unfortunately Mass Storage Devices are what I got it for...Otherwise, it is plug and play.Sonnet says this is a long-standing bug in OS X's USB 2.0 drivers. From what I can determine, it is Apple's fault, since I haven't found anyone reporting a USB 2.0 board that doesn't have this problem under OS X.I am running OS X 10.4.11 on a Dual 800 G4 Quicksilver machine (which is not supported by Leopard, but from what I hear it is still a problem in 10.5.x)"
5,Worked perfectly,This card installed easily and quickly. I booted my computer afterwards and the USB 2 ports were all fast and active. Couldn't be happier.
5,great seat,"I have found it difficult to find a plastic seat with a sturdy metal hinge. We always seem to be replacing ours because plastic hinges break and wooden seats loose their finish due to cleaning chemicals. I love this seat! Yes, it's pricey, but it looks pretty cool with the bubbles (which the photo doesn't really do justice). I've had it about a month and I'm confidant enough in the quality that I purchased a couple bathroom accessories to match it."
1,Not as pictured,"I purchased this seat from BedBathHome because it is pictured as being mother of pearl throughout both the rim and entire seat cover. In the package, it looked ok, but once the package is opened, you can see the mother of pearl design is not on the rim at all, rather it is just a squiggly design. The mother of pearl on the seat cover is only through the center, with plain edges-NOT what is shown in the picture. Apparently the new design is clearly inferior to the old, and quite frankly, the new design of this seat is ugly and just looks dirty. The catch here is that you need to open the seat package to see design differences, but once you open the package, the seat is deemed un-returnable. I am hoping for a refund based on 'not as pictured', but I may be stuck with it. I am not pleased."
4,Fabulous chillin' tunes,"A great mix of songs that I use to relax after a long day of work. Favorites so far are Nightminds (disc 1), Starlight (disc 2) and Dice (disc 2). This is one of those compilations that I listen to over and over again, finding more great songs each listen. I highly recommend this cd for fans of Electronica and Trance."
5,Great Subs when powered as recommended,"We installed 2 of these in a customers car as per JL's ported box recommendations. We wired straight parallel for a 1 ohm load using an RF Punch 1,000 with each speaker getting 500 watts rms. Woofers sounded great, but when pushed hard we noticed alot of distortion from this amp with our test equipment. We then paired the speakers to a Hifonics Brutus BRZ1700 that we had on hand. We wired at 1 ohm again with each speaker now getting 850 Watts RMS (Above JL's recommendation and can void warranty!). We put the speakers through a vigorous workout. The speakers love the extra wattage in our 4 hour pound session. The Hifonics even at half the price of the Punch 1000, proved to be King with this woofer combination. This woofer will not dissapoint if your looking for solid, clean and loud bass. Keep in mind your mileage may change depending on the amplifier you choose. We love RF amps here, but it was not the perfect match in this situation."
5,jl 10w6 the best!!,i have a sonoma 1998 gmc i put 10w6 and that thing subs nice very nice makes your passenger get out
2,blew after a week,"i had a RF 1000w punch amp hooked up to two of these, and it blew them within a week."
4,Not a toy - collectors only,"This is a great model of the Jeep with lots of working functions. But, it is out of date. Since 2007 Jeep has been putting a V6 in their Jeep Wranglers. This model has the old inline-6. So, is your are looking for accurate details, looks someplace else. As far as externally, the style has not change that much. Only a close inspection by the trained eye could pick out the discrepancies."
4,Typical Maisto,"An excellent edition of the Jeep Wrangler diecast model series and a typically good Maisto product. Good to above average detail throughout including very nice detail in the engine compartment. Only complaint is one of the doors doesn't fit the opening too well. Otherwise, very nice."
4,Works,"Listerine is really good and the product works as advertised. However, you can find this same item $2 cheaper at Target or your local market. People come online to get cheaper prices most of the time. This is the reason why I am giving this product 4 stars."
1,download impossible,I ordered this and after two frustrating days with email tech support (canned answers that I'd already checked on line) asked for a refund. When I finally got the ap downloaded and the program installed it froze my computer up every time I opened it. I have no idea if it was a good program or not--I never had a chance to find out. All I wanted was some photo page templates. Back to my trusty Printmaster 16. I'll look for album software elsewhere.
5,Wonderful Book,"Wonderful book, I wish this would of been available (or the pamphlet) while my mother was in the hospice room in the hospital. The year before her death all this information would of been very beneficial to my family. My mother would tell us her mother and father where in their living room, and she could not talk right now because she was with them. Almost all the steps I saw in my mother. All of this fell into place once I read this book."
3,La bouche,"Deff good for background music or if yr really drunk or whatever! Some of these songs are just plain bad! La bouche is the high point of this cd, and it's not even remixed! ): its worth the price tho, very very cheap.I'll try working out to it, maybe I'll find it's niche.C-"
4,Pancake Maker,"HOW do you say that name? Well, it's pronounced ""able-SKEW-er"" and now that's out of way I can say that this is a great product. I tried one of the recipes that came with it and it was delicious. The only thing I would caution cooks is that the handle gets hot so ALWAYS use a pot holder."
5,Easier to use than I thought-good quality product.,"I followed the simple instructions on the label and seasoned the pan (very easy.) Then tried the aebelskiver recipe which was also on the pan (did add a tablespoon of sugar as it didn't have any at all), and success, they turned out perfectly! Not difficult at all, did not stick...no problems whatsoever. I would recommend this pan to anyone looking for a Danish pancake pan. I read some reviews saying it was small, however, the aebelskivers are the correct size, so I'm quite happy to have the pan be compact and small, rather than bulky, large and heavy.I first tasted the Danish pancakes from Trader Joe's and loved them, but its only a matter of time until they discontinue them :( Now I can make them at home from scratch! Five stars!"
2,Was this a joke?,"I HAVE BEEN MAKEING AND EATIN AEBLESKIVERS FOR 40 YEARS SO I FIGURED I WOULD GET AN IRON FOR MY SON. WHEN THE PACKAGE ARRIVED I ALMOST DIED. THIS IS THE SMALLEST I HAVE EVER SEEN. DOES NOT DO THE JOB. GIVEIN, IT IS CAST IRON AND HAS THE POTS FOR THE CAKES BUT IS WAY TOO SMALL. THESE TAKE ALOT OF TIME TO MAKE AND PRODUCE SO YOU WANT YOUR IRON TO DO THE JOB FAST. TRUST ME IF YOU GET AN IRON THAT IS THE RIGHT SIZE AND NOT A MINI VERSION OF THE REAL DEAL YOU WILL BE MUCH HAPPIER. SPEND A LITTLE MORE AND GET THE ONE THAT IS 15"" YOU'LL BE FINSIHED SOONER AND BE ABLE TO ENJOY THESE WITH YOUR FAMILY."
4,Fun,Well made and a pleasure to use. My grandson has developed an addiction to these wonderful little pancakes and has become quite adept at making them. This pan is a great value.
1,microscopic dingballs,"I grew up on Aebleskiver which us kids called ding balls. This pan is microscopic and unusable. The one my grandma had , had 12 LARGE holes in it and was the size of a full size skillet.I am not amused by this."
2,It came covered in Rust!!!,"Oh boy, was I disappointed in the way this came to me. I was excited to receive this product, because I had seen the Aebleskivers made on TV and wanted to try it myself. I knew this product would be on the small side, but that didn't matter.I opened the box to find the bottom of the skillet covered in rust and part of the top. So disappointing! So, I had to go out of my way to figure out how to remove rust from a cash iron skillet. I was surprised that the company would have packed it the way they did."
4,"Excellent pan, a bit small.","This pan is excellent in every way, except I wish it were larger (made more abelskivers at one time). The cast iron is wonderful and with a little cooking spray, the aebleskivers turn very easily. (The reviewer who complained of flat disks, should try turning his aebleskivers as that is really the only way to get a round ball - I mean these aren't cake pop pans, although now I'm thinking I might try using this for all sorts of ball shaped foods.) This pan is excellent quality and for the low price there is no comparison. Don't waste money on nonstick that will flake off into your food. If you don't want to spend $50 for a aebleskiver pan at gourmet kitchen store, this is comparable quality in a smaller size."
3,Tiny pan,I was right to assume this was a smaller pan because of the lower price. This is not as heavy as some other ebelskiver pans I own. This is pretty tiny and the heat distribution is not great so you have hot spots because it is small.
4,very pleased!,"I am new to making aebleskivers and needed a pan. I put the Lodge pan on my wish list at Amazon; lo and behold, it went up 14% within days after doing so. Determined not to be taken advantage of, I ordered this cheaper pan and could not be happier. It is a small pan, about the size of a large burner, but the wells are deep. One thing that completely impressed me is how well this unseasoned pan seasoned on the first run. It blackened on the first try; usually a pan takes several tries. I even season my ""preseasoned"" pans before I used them. This one came along beautifully. Now to master making aebleskivers...."
3,"Yes, it's very tiny!","I was curious about making these pancakes, so I ordered the cheapest pan I could find. If you, too, are simply curious, I would recommend this pan. It took forever to make the entire batch from the recipe I used, simply because they are so small, but it made a lot. If you are an old pro at making these and would like to make it a family ritual, then I would spend more and get a bigger size pan. If you simply want to try making these, this pan should be sufficient."
1,Disapointed,"The cavities in the pan should be half rounds, these are only one half inch deep. Instead of getting round abelskivers like a tennis ball you get flat disks like a hockey puck. This may seem trevial but when you stuff aebleskivers with items like strawberries (yum yum) it does make a differance. Go for a castiron pan with half round cavities, you'll be happier."
3,"Nice pan, but very small.","This is a nice little pan, but the aebleskiver (pronounced able-skewer) produced are really tiny. Be prepared to make a quantity double or more than the normal size."
1,i hate it,"never purchase this item...when i used this pan for first time, as instructed...and as soon as i put this on flame it gave me some kind of odd odor. i thought may be bcaz of first time, but second time also same odor. and it is very difficult to clean. i shud have bought one with nonstick coated...."
5,Aebleskiver pan,"Believe it or not, I haven't had a chance to cook in this pan yet. I'm dying to try it, but have been so busy with Christmas things I haven't yet. I've got a couple of mixes to try, and I'm sure it will work just fine. After Christmas!"
2,Rust Stains,"This is my preliminary review prior to using the pan. I handwashed product as I always do for new/ used items, and left it in dishwasher to dry. When I came back the pan had tons of ugly orange rust stains on both sides from the water drops. I attempted to scrub and rewash the pan but couldn't get the rust 100% off. Upset at the rust which can be harmful. =("
1,UNHAPPY WITH NORPRO AEBLESKIVER PAN,"WASN'T AWARE OF JUST HOW 'TINY' IT WAS, VERY INCONVENIENT, TAKES ABOUT 2 TABLESPOONS OF BATTER AND PAN BARELY FIT ON MY COOK TOP, KEPT WOBBLING. MUST WORK INCREDIBLY FAST, VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THE PRODUCT. NOT WORTH THE BOTHER."
1,Total Unsatisfied,"Not like your ordinary cast iron pans. Even by seasoning the pan more than once, it rusts very quickly. I would not buy another one. I will look for a non-stick Teflon one."
1,just horrible,It started rusting from day one! Will never recommend anyone to buy this product. Just horrible purchase in my recent past
1,Definitely has a chemical in it,"I admittedly scoffed at some of the other reviewers suggestion that this had some chemicals in it. I've seasoned a number of cast iron cooking utensils in the past, so I mistakenly assumed they goofed up the seasoning. I was wrong.After my first attempt to season it, dark brown goo started to leach out from all surfaces. My guess it's some sort of metal protectant. As cast iron is porous, a rust preventative dip is the likely culprit.There is little chance I'll use this to cook with, as I'm kind of opposed to even more chemical's then I am already exposed to. Not sure exactly what I'm going to do, but it won't get used for food until I can discover a way to leach out all of the chemicals. I'm thinking of putting it on my next camp fire and getting it scorching hot. If it doesn't crack, the intense heat might just ""bake"" out most of the chemicals."
3,Aebleskiver Pan,"I tried this and the batter stuck to it, I oiled it well too, so I think if I had of known I would have bought a non-stick one instead."
1,"Treated with nasty stuff, do not buy!","I wash so happy when I got this pan, and after cleaning it, we tried it, but has to spit out the samples in disgust! They tasted cemical, and sure enough, the whole pan started smoking like crazy. It doesn't say anything about being treated with anything, but it is truely disgusting, and I am really angry. Will write to the company now, but thought I'd warn any other potential buyers first."
3,"working well,but too hot handle","You have to seasoned at first time as soon as you buy it.With little bit of oil, it works well and Kids love to eat pancake puffs that made on it.Be careful! It's very hot to handle so you need to grib cover because its handle is small so I could not use big kitchen glove."
4,aebelskiver pan,This is a good quality pan it's just small so if you need to make a large amount it takes a long time.Very impressed by the quality for the price.
2,"Apparently, I am not supposed to make tiny pancakes.","This pan is, typical of most cast iron ware, quite difficult to maintain at low temperature, tough on creating uniform cooking, and darn near impossible to not create a sticky mess. I used what I considered to be a fairly simple recipe for filled pancakes and they came out undercooked, burnt, and some appeared resentful. I wish I could return it, but instead I will just keep experimenting. Maybe I'll find some way to make it work, or use it as an attractive door stop."
5,happy with this crib,"When we found out I was going to have #2 when number one was only going to be 20 months, I knew we would have to find something to go in our bedroom for a longer period of time than the average bassinet or cradle. Our crib converts into a toddler bed and I wanted #1 to have it for a while longer. We found this on amazon and it has served it's purpose very well for four months so far. The weight limit on it is something like 50 lbs- which is absolutely ridiculous- I wouldn't make my 25 lb toddler sleep in this crib. Anyway, when we got it home I was careful to check the support board (because of reading the few negative reviews of this crib) and we decided it was safe enough to trust my newborn in. Haven't had a problem yet!"
1,COSCO got highest fine ever from Consumer Product Safety Com,"Almost bought this crib. Need a portable crib and was encouraged by other reviews. Then did a little surfing and learned that Cosco and its sister company Safety 1st got the highest fine ever for a children's furniture manufacturer from Consumer Products Safety Commission for failing to report to the Commission children's injuries and deaths from their products- including their cribs. Sorry, can't trust this particular manufacturer with my child's safety. No sale. (Update June 2004: the Baby Bargains book -great book and available at Amazon- gives Cosco a very poor rating as does Consumer Reports. I ended up buying an LA Baby metal folding crib, like those used in daycare centers. I found it on bizrate.com and am very happy with it)"
5,Great for baby,"This portacrib is great. We just got it and it was so easy to assemble and is very sturdy. In addition, it is easy to dissasemble for storage or travel. What is really great about it is that it can be used longer than a bassinet since the mattress can be lowered for when the baby begins to pull up."
4,Wonderful addition!,"My husband and I bought this crib for Grandma's house so that my son could safely nap when she babysat for him. Before he could get around on his own, we let him nap on the Twin bed with Guard rails on it. So, we bought this crib with the Koala jersey porta crib sheets and Koala bumper also sold here. I was a bit worried because the crib doesn't appear to be as sturdy as a regular crib, but it TOTALLY IS! My son loves napping and playing in it. The wheels make it easy to move around the room. It's too heavy to travel with, but for a spare room or a nap station, it's WONDERFUL!"
4,Great alternative to a pack n play,"I bought this because my daughter has hated the pack n play from day one. She is now 13 months old and it was a major battle at each travel destination. When we decided to leave her with grandma for a few nights we knew we needed a crib. This one is great because it is very sturdy. The folding locks take a bit of getting used to, but they work well. The mattress is thin and we purchased a mattress for it for about $20. I bought portable crib sheets at Babies R Us and they work great. My daughter sleeps in this like her regular crib and I think we will get a lot of use from it! It does fold nice and flat, but it is still large for the average car. We can put it in our Suburban. It would be nice if they made one that has sides that fold in half for storage, but no one does! I love this crib."
5,great,"My baby used this every night.Why buy an expensive crib when you are only going to use it for about 2 or 3 years. They have great bedding for these cibs, so just save money."
4,"Mom has it, now I want one.","My mom has this portable crib and used it for her other grandchildren. I am expecting my first and HAD to have one too. For our shore house, it is easy to open and close and can fit through the doorway (open) if we want to put the crib and baby in another room. You CANNOT do that with a standard size crib. Also it's sturdier than a pack n play, along with higher so you don't have to reach too far down to get the baby. I LOVED this portable crib at Mom's and now I have one too. Hope the baby loves it as much as me. Yes, he does. Our son slept wonderfully in this crib the first time we put him in it. He loves it at the shore house and at Grandmas."
4,Seemed great at first,"We loved the size, look and sturdiness of this portable crib. Our 4 month old is quickly getting too large for her bassinet and this seemed like the perfect step up.Even with a portable bumper pad, my baby keeps kicking her leg through the rail while laying down. I have to keep a sharp eye on her as I'm afraid that she will break her leg. I first noticed this problem a few days ago as she was crying and when I turned around, her leg was sticking out.I pretty much only put her in it when she's super drousy but I'm going to take it back and get a play yard as I don't want to take any chances. I already have a play yard at her daycare center and didn't want to get another one, but it will be so worth the peace of mind.This crib would be great for babies that don't like to kick as mine does. She's a little wiggle worm!"
2,very disappointed,"After reading all the good reviews for this product I was excited to purchase it for my 18 month old daughter (25 lbs) since she does not sleep well in a pack and play when we travel.But after looking at the floor model at a Babies R Us in my area, I knew right away that it would not be appropriate for a child of this age (or at least my child who is of average height and quite active). She looked like a giant in there and I would not feel comfortable allowing her to sleep in it due to safety reasons. I think this crib would be perfect for a 12 month old or younger (or an older child who is on the small side) since it did look to be of good quality. But I honestly can't imagine how a child older than 15 months (max) would be safe in this crib.I wish there was a portable type crib out there for bigger kids, there certainly would be a market for it based on the opinions of the moms I've talked to!"
1,dangerous after 3 years of use,"Do not recall when we bought this product (somewhere in the last 3 years) but we used it with no problems for at least one other child. Our baby is now 10 weeks and within the last week or two on two occasions, the board of the crib slipped and child ended up on the floor while sliding out between the board and the metal frame. Possibly because of the repeated use (though I would not call our use of it as rough) but it is too dangerous to use it."
2,"Says you can take it with you, after all","There are some good points in this book, which is basically a more theologically conservative version of the same argument that Andy Crouch makes in ""Culture Making"", which comes from the school of Reformed Kuyperians. It basically says that you can, in fact, take it with you-- that our best cultural artifacts will be with us in heaven. I think this is actually a very dangerous view that can lead directly to worldliness and a loss of the Gospel in the life of the church. For a critique, see ""What is the Mission of the Church?"" by DeYoung and Gilbert."
3,Therapy emotion puppets,"I got these for my private counselling practice working with kids. They look like hte picture, its just that the material is really really thin...so not sure how long they'll last. the emotions are good, i just wish more quality material would have been used."
4,Rescue Pets Wake Me Up Spaniel,"My daughter loves her new alarm clock. It is a little louder that I expected in its mechanical movements (motor hums as it moves to sit up or lay down). And if your child cannot remember how to shut off the barking, it automatically goes off by itself in under 1 minute."
5,It's great!,My 4 year old grandaughter loves it! Now she can get up by herself without having someone else wake her up!
5,Makes for Happy Mornings!,"My 7-year-old daughter got this for Christmas last year and loves it! When it wakes her up, she is always happy (no more grumpy mornings -- really). Clock and alarm aren't the easiest to set, but OK once you get the hang of it. Did not wake up my child in the next room."
4,"Adorable, a little complex, can't adjust volume","My 8yo dd got this from her grandma. She wanted it so bad. She loved it when she got, it's so soft and squishy, and so cute. She's used it the first few mornings, but says she doesn't want to use it anymore because it scares her when it barks. I'm sure this is just a personality quirk. We've tried putting it in different places in the room so it's not loud, which it's not really loud anyway, but that doesn't make a difference. We also have had a time with setting the alarm properly. There are two on/off switches and the dogs legs don't seem to go into the right position every time it is set, so I never know for sure the alarm will go off. This has been our experience."
2,Needs more detailed explanations!,"If you, like me, will start hating the whole subject of non-life insurance while reading this book, don't blame yourself, it's not your fault. The book needs more structure and detailing to be recommended to master students, not to mention bachelor ones."
5,Perfect for a cabinet,"Works exactly as it's supposed to! I have one in the pantry for boxes of tea and one in the cabinet for spices to sit on. It's nice that it is adjustable as well. I felt compelled to review since someone doesn't understand that a review is for a product, not for a shipping error."
5,Wonderful organizer for corner cabinet,Chose this over a lazy susan type of organizer. This allows me to see all of the items. I was very impressed with the quality. The expansion is solid. I can use this for some other future use and won't be limited by the size I chose for this use. (I have it angled in one of those awkward kitchen corner cabinets.) Good value.
1,Non-Skid Adjustable cavinet Organizer,I was sent the wrong item but everything was taken care of promptly.
5,"Thought is was crazy, but it works!","I was thinking this was a crazy product to spend so much money on. My wife saw me looking at it and bought it since I wouldn't spend this much money on a big toothbrush! I was wrong. It works really well and helps to prevent ingrown hairs. It just works. You wouldn't brush your teeth with your fingers, why brush your whiskers with them?Update: I dropped on the shower floor and the handle broke. The plastic needs to be tougher. This is not acceptable for the price. It should be able to handle being dropped on the floor without breaking. Still, it does work.Update 2: I missed it and bought another."
2,What is it's use? Don't see a change,"I have been a person struggling with acne the past three years and I thought maybe I wasn't thoroughly washing my face well enough, so I thought a scrubbing brush would be able to go deeper inside and get the impurities out. I've used this product for about two weeks, and I absolutely no difference in complexion or tone. I still have the blackheads on my nose. This product really costs a whole lot for something that doesn't really do what it says it will do. I gave it two stars simply because I'm sure it cleans, it just doesn't clean any better than your hands would."
2,How could they do this,"""No, No, No, No"" was all that was running through my head as I heard these songs. All Saints took waht must have been two of the best songs ever - and ruined them. But I have to give Shaznay some credit, at least she tried to sing. The All Saints should be locked up for doing this"
3,Stick to Classics,The book is laid out in decades. Each chapter covers 10 years starting from 1897 to the time to writing. Boik summarizes each decade in about 20 pages or so (about economy and how the legenardy traders did). Each chapter uses the same template and same wording which made it difficult to read and at times I thought I was reading the previous chapter. Boik also promotes his first book way too many times throughout. We get it!!! You have another book. So why 3 stars instead of 1? There are few good words of wisdom about trading.I would recommend skipping this book (unless you want a summary) and read some of the classics:The Battle for Investment Survival - Gerald LoebHow to Make Money in Stocks - William o'NeilHow I Made Two Million Dollars in the Stock Market - Nicolas DarvasBaruch: My Own story - Benard BaruchThe above traders are the featured traders in Boik's book so it would be better to get it straight from the source.
2,A bad replication of his previous bestseller,"I rated the author's previous book ""Lessons from the Greatest Stock Traders of All Time"" a four star and titled my review as ""A shortcut to must reads about the best stock traders ever"". To my disappointment, this latter one is so similar to that. The addition of three more legends (but with relatively less coverage) just didnt help. I felt strongly of being cheated. Even worse, the first one is much better. I would suggest potential buyers to get that instead of this."
4,Antique Entertainment,This is great product. There is nothing to assemble and the box looks like an antique. No complaints with sound quality!
1,"Worst Ever, Caught Fire! Not 1, TWO!",The Crosley CR 79 looks great and is a terrific idea. HOWEVER! I ordered one from retroelectronics for my Daughter as a Christmas gift and after 3 days it started smoking when she turned it on. I got a refund and the seller didn't even want it back. I went online and found another from eTailelectronics and they delivered it very quickly. I took it out of the box and put on an LP. It stopped playing in the middle of the 3rd song!!!It won't turn on. The only good thing was this one didn't start a fire. I don't know who Crosley has building these things but they must have employed pyromaniacs.
1,Junk!!,"The quality of this machine is as poor as can be. Brand new and it ""ate"" the first cassette tape I put in it. Sound qualtiy is poor as well as craftman ship. You can't even read the lettering on the front to know which function is which. Quite a waste of money. I reccommend people to stay away."
1,Disappointing,"It worked for maybe a day. It rarely responds to the remote. And now, it rarely turns on. When it does turn on, it doesn't respond when other buttons are pushed. I was excited to have a system that would play all of my old music and my new music. I'm still looking. This system was a major disappointment."
3,An excellent counterpoint to the Iacocca books....,"As you will find out if you read this book, Iacocca was not a car guy - he was a businessman, a ""mogul"" in the business of cars.This book provides a counterpoint to the Iacocca books, from a different viewpoint: from within the engineering and production ""trenches"".No only does Yates chronicle the development of the third generation minivan; he chronicles with it the transformation of the Chrysler Corporation.Adequately written, very insightful. Incredible access to what transpired at Chrysler during this time.Recommended. Especially for minivan owners or prospective buyers."
4,Interesting book that could've been penned by Rush Limbaugh,"I really enjoyed reading this book. An interesting look into the automobile industry, although slightly repetative at times and with some lax editing. Unfortunately, Yates takes pot shots at liberals, Clinton, Gore, etc instead of sticking to the subject. If I want political commentary I'll read P.J. O'Rourke. Also incredible is his dismisal of the problem with Chrysler rear latches as if it's the no-good liberals sticking their nose where it doesn't belong. I really thought it was a very good book when Yates ccould keep his political views to himself and come down off his highhorse."
4,The next generation of lighting,"This is a great light at a great price. I own many Streamlight products and this light lived up to the quality I've grown to expect from them. Solid build, regulated battery life, Lumileds l.e.d. and a slick design make for a light that will be around for a long time."
3,You get what you pay for,This is not to be called tactical. It uses lumileds instead of Luxeon or Cree which produces more bright light with the same level of battery power. Its bright but the beam doesn't project any further than 50 feet. I would suggest gettig a fenix P3D CE or Inova T series. Those are infact to be called tactical/police flashlight.
2,Misnamed,"I purchased this product after searching on Amazon for black lights to detect scorpians. It is a led light but NOT a black light that I was looking to buy. Being named ""Scorpion"" and being under a search for black lights is deceiving because it is NOT a black light. I am disappointedin the advertising for this product. I am still searching for a ""BlackLight"" flashlight."
4,Super bright!,"Small, doesn't roll away, super bright, doesn't destroy batteries. This little flashlight puts out an amazing amount of bright white light.Two complaints-The price is rather expensive, which is why I'm rating it at 4 stars instead of 5.It's a little difficult to keep it on without continuously pressing down the button. When I press the button hard enough to turn it on, it's hard to press it down hard enough to shut it off. For a $45 flashlight, I'd expect this to not be an issue."
4,Good inexpensive light,"I bought this light as a backup flashlight for work. It's very bright, the construction is sturdy and it feels good in my hand. I also bought a second one to mount to my rifle, works perfectly. My only complaint is that it takes CR123 batteries, which are hard to find good prices on (online), and they seem to run out of juice about once a month. Granted that's with regular use 40 hrs. a week, so maybe my standards are too high. Overall a good inexpensive backup or tactical light."
3,The grip slips,"I've been using this flashlight for more than a year. I'm very happy with the brightness, the battery life, etc.However, the rubber grip began slipping off the flashlight after about a year (not all the way off, just 1/8 inch at a time). So now when I use my thumb to turn it on/off by pressing the button at the base: (1) I feel the grip slipping and (2) this makes it harder to push the on/off button because extra rubber collects at the base where the button is and (3) it's now a recurring hassle that I have to slide the grip back into place every time I turn this thing on/off.Next time I'll probably buy a model without a rubber grip unless they fix this problem."
3,weird tailcap switch,"I probably shoudl have gone with a surefire. I have a little flashlight fetish and I tend to buy lots of them. This light is very bright and has a solid housing, but it only has one mode (bright) and it has a really weird tailcap that I don't care for -- the activation switch is sort of recessed inside of the end of the housing. You have to insert a finger or thumb a bit to activate the light. The technique I was taught and have always used for activating the tailcap does not work well with this light; could be tricky if I have to use my weapon and the light simultaneously. But it is fairly bright and good quality. I may just get relugated to in the car emergency use, not great for a tactical application."
4,Fine item - great for first aid kit & hiking,"I have a couple of tubes of anti-biotic ointment around the house - but I really like these individual packets better for hiking and backpacking. I carry a first aid kit when I'm hiking in the mountains, and these are easy to stash just about anywhere."
3,The picture quality is less when prints are taken,I purchased this camera as I got a good deal on Amazon.com. But the picture quality is not good when prints are taken. Especially when printing indoor pictures. I decided to return and got a Sony cybershot
3,A Historical Project,"I love and respect the Carter Family as the first family of country music. It was nice to see that Maybelle and Sarah were still singing and making music in their late 60's. They still had the sound of the back country, but it seemed harsher somehow in the more mature voice. I will still listen to this periodically, but the original stuff will remain my favorites."
5,Reviewing blind.,"Since I have never heard this CD I can only comment on the content which I have heard. This is the first 12 songs on the Historic Reunion of Sara a Maybelle record which was bought in about 1968 or 69 and which is a treasured posession. If the CD is a good a quality as the record then I will look forward to owning it. I grew up with the Carter family, and others from the 1930's as our radio station started out playing old 78's and that was what they had. I have nothing but admiration for both of these women and their abilities, and professional aproach to the recording. I look forward to having some of the cds which I have discovered here."
2,Old and tired.,"Very disappointed with this. It's old and tired. Neither Sara nor Maybelle have their heart in this one, no sparkle, no soul, no fire. Really not worth the purchase."
5,Don't believe the nay-sayers because this game is a blast,"This is, hands down, the best Vietnam War game out there. I've had this game for several years and recently reinstalled it on my PC, and it's just as fun now as it was when I first played it. Your role is that of a Special Forces intelligence sergeant who's part of Team A-216 stationed in Vietnam's Central Highlands, astraddle to the Cambodian border. The graphics aren't spectacular and the AI isn't the smartest, but the missions, maps, terrain, and overall atmosphere make this game a must-have. Your team is also very helpful and you need to work with them in order to accomplish the objectives.Multiplayer sucks bad, but nobody plays it anyways, so don't let that discourage you. And if you think you're going to roll through the bush blazing away on full-auto with your M16, while mowing the NVA down, think again because you'll be KIA in short-order. This is not a ""Rambo"" 1st person shooter."
2,Minimum specs requirements NOT accurate,"Forget running this on anything near the minimum requirements as listed on the box. I had this running on an XP system, 1500 mhz with a 32 meg graphics card and it STINKS. 64 meg would appear to be the minimum graphics card. Otherwise it's jerky movement and LOTS of slowdown. Consoles with FAR less CPU strength run better looking games than this. What a let down."
3,"Good, but not my cup of tea.","The latest in ""Rock"", being ""punk rock"", is not my cup of tea. However, the song ""Let's Get F****d Up"" is just too much fun. Knowing this song from the first Jackass movie because of my kids introducing it to me, well, it's just fun. Crass, but fun. I like to refer to the Jackass crew as the ""Three Stooges on Steroids"". So, if punk is your thing, you're golden here. I just bought the disc for the above song (I need an I-pod)."
1,Squeals like a mouse,"I had these installed on my SUV and it started squealing a couple weeks later. My car sounded like one of those big rig trucks with a 100 ton load coming to a screeching stop. I had it replaced under warranty with Wagner SX785 pads. So far the SX series is quiet. So if you're thinking about these, I'd recommend the SX785, or even some other brand, instead. I can't believe this is called ThermoQuiet, instead it should be called ThermoSquealer."
2,"Read description carefully, these are not rear pads","Heading of add for these brake pads clearly says ""rear"" however they are for the front brakes of a Chev not rear. If you select ""make sure these fit your vehicle"" it will say in small type they are for the front. Somewhat misleading heading."
1,Noisy--run away!,"Like some other reviewers have noticed, these things squeal and groan. I figured I'd upgrade our car with name brand pads, but I'll be replacing them soon since they're completely annoying. Beware!"
2,No References What So Ever,"I was not satisfied at all with this book. As a matter of fact, I could not finish it. When dealing with areas of science, references are important. This author may have good information, yet without references it is hard to discern because there aren't any for 99.9% of the material in this book. It is hearsay or religion or more like a novel. If you are looking for information that can be researched or confirmed, this is not the book. Great artistic book cover, yet no hard evidence on the inside. It is true, 'you can't judge a book by its cover'. The title of the book gives a clue to the references in it, 'invisible'."
3,Hmm...,This is a decent meat-and-potatoes keyboard but the trackball skips a bit even right out of the box. By that I mean I turn the trackball but the arrow on the screen doesn't always move with it.
5,Excellent Highlights,"I do not pretend to be an expert on Muddy Waters. I saw a TV biography and was motivated to get a ""greatest hits"" CD. There was a 2 disc option at Amazon, but then I saw this one. I checked it out with various reviewers, and it met the bill. All the songs are well done, and the whole CD seems like a great overview of the blues from this specific artist. From all I can tell, this would be an excellent highlight collection for anybody who wants just one CD of Muddy Waters."
4,50's Soul Music,Music that bring back history lessons from conversations over heard by our parents. Some of the sounds bring back memories of listening to the radio during the 50's and 60's or listening to our parents talk about music with their friends or remembering them having friends over for card parties and dancing.(50's Soul Music)
3,muddy,"to be perfectly honest i have never been a muddy waters devotee,strangely,but thought i should try it,just does not work for me,but for a muddy fan it would be great."
3,Coolest B grade stuff,"Laila is a story of two con girls. They seduce the riches and blackmail them. It's episodic covering various spheres of Indian society. It involves a politician,doctor,professor,god man, film star,film producer etc. There is a detective who is after a mysterious girl named Laila. The trap laid by him is filled with twist and turns. It shows the naked truth in a naked way. Payal is hot and acts o.k. Laila is quite engaging. The story flows at fast pace with oodles of steamy stuff. It's kinda sexual satire. It's funny. The film drops due to bad actors,lousy background score and tacky action scenes. But Hey i enjoyed it. Coolest B grade stuff. Its a good watch for a lazy weekend. Don't miss it."
2,Working through the bugs,"At first my music sounded horrible. I figured out that I needed to turn down the volume control on my iPod AND take the EQ setting off (which I'd set to ""Bass Booster"").Having gotten past that, I enjoyed pretty decent (but not great) sound quality, only to have another problem crop up. My car's tape deck began reversing direction automatically every few seconds, cutting off the music each time. Ugh!...I hope this is fixable (haven't found the solution yet), but I sure could have used some clearer directions when I bought the adapter.So...so far, I'm finding this is not a carefree ""plug & play"" product. Hopefully, it'll wind up being fully functional, though."
2,Charger gets 5 stars; cassette gets zippo,"Both items worked perfect for about 30 days, then the cassette started rattling to the point of being completely annoying and distracting. I had to throw it away and ended up buying an FM transmitter which works better.Both the charger and cassette have AWESOME retractable cords. I especially appreciate the charger having this because, well, for one it works, and for two I keep my ipod right next to my cigarette adapter. No long cords lying around!If they sell these items separately go for the charger...skip the cassette, it is junk."
3,not faszinating,"This video was a bit disappointing like several other German-produced Porsche documentaries I have seen. The video footage is good but it is assembled in a confusing way and, let's face it, they can't pick decent background music to save their lives."
3,Not up to standard,"I bought this set because I had owned a set of 3 COPCO mixing bowls for at least 15 years. One has cracked and chipped, probably from being dropped so many times. This new set, however, is just not as good quality as my previous set. It almost seems flimsy compared to what I had. While it is certainly adequate for what its used for, I was very disappointed. Had I seen it in a store, I would not have bought it. Having the lids is nice and the rubber on the bottom to prevent slippage (similar to what I had before) is a great feature."
5,has every feature we were looking for,"We wanted mixing bowls that you could pour from, that had lids, and that had measurement inside, With these bowls, everything finally came together. We looked a long time until we found these."
4,A dummies review,"I would recommend this book for anyone to use as a reference guide. It is super informative, and hilarious. It's also filled with great conversation anecdotes for cocktail parties and just funny ""did you know"" facts. The CD has some really great recordings and is a nice place to start in getting familiar with opera."
5,A good lively intro to opera.,I like this book and the accompying cd. It gives a bit of everything and for the low used-book-price I got a real bargain.
3,Book is Amusing but the CDrom is destructive,"WARNING:I made the mistake of installing the software that came with this book. It managed to override my recently installed version 5 of Quicktime with an antique version. Now, neither works and the uninstall feature won't remove the offending software.Save yourself trouble. Use the CD as a coaster. Better still, throw it away."
5,Great book for opera *newbies*,"As you see in many of the other reviews, this is a great guide that will introduce you to opera without overwhelming you. I am new to opera, and this book gave me what I was looking for - a great understanding of opera terms, a history of the composers, and best of all, a scene-by-scene overview of 70+ operas (I didn't even realize there were that many operas!). The writing is informal, easy reading, and full of witty comments and references to the modern era. And don't forget the music CD (which I only played on my car stereo, not on my computer). The music and singing is really gorgeous, and a real treat when paired up with what you learn in the book.If you are just stepping into the wacky, wonderful world of opera, you can't go wrong this book and CD combo to jumpstart your learning."
4,I wish I knew the authors personally,"Funny, entertaining, and packed with very important information, such as that Handel's name is pronounced HEN'del, that you might be able to snub an opera snob by talking a bunch of nonsense about such things as legato, rubato and da capos, and and that it is often possible to sneak in to the opera during intermissions because the ticket-takers don't check to make sure you've got a ticket! I have not yet tried going to the backstage entrance and giving my name to the security guards to possibly be chosen to meet with the opera stars. But I will. Get this book, it will hold your interest and make you well informed."
4,Would have earned 5 stars except for the crass commercialism,"Pogue and Speck provide a wonderful, humorous, and accessible text in ""Opera for Dummies.""I just wish they or IDG (publishers) would stop pumping the ""free CD"" on every page. Readers don't need reminding, after the dozenth time, that a CD is included with the book ... besides at [$$] (retail) for book and CD, it's NOT free, we paid for it. Also the multiple reminders of their ""Classical Music for Dummies"" is nearly as annoying.That said, I found the book highly entertaining and educational."
3,disappointed,faulty.. it wouldn't completely play. I finally gave up on it and was really disappointed. WIsh the cd would have played. it sounded interesting
4,"A bit repetitive, but recommended for the scope of its archival access.","I enjoyed this read though felt the author's style to be quite repetitive. The obvious strength is Volkogonov's personal experience, proximity to the leaders and issues discussed, and most importantly his access to the Russian archives. There are some truly outstanding quotes pulled out from all those previously off-limits state documents and meeting notes. However the arguments tend to be stated a few times too many, especially on sections for Lenin, Stalin, and Gorbachev. Still a good piece of work and enjoyable for anyone interested in the more inside world of the Kremlin during the Soviet regime."
3,More Original Bruce,Another publication from the early 70's for those of you who must have Bruce Lee stuff. It is older training techniques some of which are still effective today and some of which have been proven ineffective. Not for those of you looking for the most accurate and correct cross training techniques to supplement you martial arts.
2,I wanted more substance,"There's really not a lot here. We learn a thing or two about Bruce Lee's fighting stance and workout methods, but I had higher hopes for this book. He writes about his vertical fist punch, delivered like a fencer. But this thin book left me pretty unsatisfied."
2,WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY,"Body awarness like speed, power, balance ??? I would sau body unawarness like body pain,pain and pain. That's what you'll receive while TRYING to do the most IMPOSSIBLE ""exercises"" in this book. Don't be a fool man, don't waste you money and time on this book !!!"
5,THIS BOOK SHOULD BE EVERY MARTIAL ARTIST'S NEW BIBLE!,"This book goes over every aspect of fighting you can imagine! There is information on footwork, power, speed, proper stance, etc. There is also a lot of important stuff on non-telagraphing, too.Bottom line is you need toGET THIS BOOK RIGHT NOW!"
4,The Fighting Method Series Captures Bruce Lee,"Mito Uyehara was the founder and publisher of Black Belt magazine. Mito actually took privates from Bruce in his office according to staff legend. Mito also gave Bruce plenty of exposure in Black Belt, but the books in this series, Bruce Lee's Fighting Methods, are the true legacy of that relationship. Mito was very protective of Bruce's image and his admiration for him is as clear as the many photographs in these books.Of course, Bruce Lee was always changing his methods and ideas about training. To what degree he would have stood behind this material some 40-years later has been the subject of much debate. The closest thing to a modern version of this series is How to Master Bruce Lee's Fighting Style by Lee student Joe Lewis, who credits much of his success to principles he learned while working with Bruce Lee.But, ""never take your eyes off the finger, or you will miss a great book for any Bruce Lee fan."""
3,Not Exactly What I thought it'd be,"I was sort of suprised that since it was written by Bruce Lee that it wasn't a very super quality book.I over estimated the usefulness of this book, although there are some good sectionssuch as speed training and power hitting.This book is written for Jeet Kun Do fighters I think.."
1,Piece of Crap!,"Piece of Crap!This is a Piece of Crap product...Trigger Mechanism stopped working after only four (4) uses (once a week use). I called the seller IN THE HOLE! Golf...someone name ""Steve"" told me, ""can not do any thing about"" and gave me the manufacturer number...some answer from them too.I should have bought ""the Original Shag Bags"" (made In the USA)."
5,Perfect for Christmas shopping season & All year,Wonderful book to help busy working mom's and family gift buyers. Insightful and useful information on how and what to purchase for all age levels. Definitely a must during the holiday season and all year round. This was a delightful and fun read.
5,I just love this book!,"I can't stop reading this book! Each chapter is better than the previous one and there is SO much I learned about toys. I'm pregnant with my first child and my mom bought me this book as a gift. She told me that I need to know everything about toys now so I do not make the same mistakes as my siblings who bought way too many toys that my nieces and nephews rarely play with. This is an amazing resource for preschool and kindergarten teachers too and the best part is that this book does not dictate what toys are the best. The reader is left to decide that based on what the authors have taught you. It's really a parenting book and class all in one! They have a website too.... toytips.com lists tons of toy reviews based on research for you to review. I LOVE that! I've looked at other websites that have reviews and opinions of a few parents and their experiences with specific toys but this is so much better than that! Great find. Great buy! Thanks, Mom!"
2,Cute but not entertaining enough,"We also bought this mobile to match our son's bedding set. We were disappointed because the music box plays in ultra fast mode - sounds like Brahms Lullaby on turbo, and the music plays for less than two minutes. The music and the length of play do not make this an item that helps lull my son to sleep. I'd return this mobile, but our son likes the bears and smiles at them as they spin around."
2,Disappointed with construction.,"We bought this mobile to match the set we picked out for my son's nursery. Although he loves watching the mobile spin, 1 month after we bought it the hook that holds the mobile snapped off and broke. We fixed it temporarily. Good thing it did not snap off while our son was in the crib. It would have landed on top of him. We were very disappointed with the construction of this mobile, for this reason. We will be returning it."
2,Tired of winding it up,"We bought this Mobile because it goes with our Son's Theme and he loves watching the Bears, but my Husband and I really wish that it had a Remote Control. We got tired winding it up every 10 minutes. We brought another one that has a Remote."
3,my son loved it -but it broke,My son loved to watch this mobile...he would stare at it all day if we let him. :-) the problem we had with ours was that the wind up mechanism would stick/clic and then finally stopped working altogether.(this was after just a few days of use) I am going to send it back and hopefully get another that is put together better.
2,Time limit too short,"My son loves to watch the bears moving around and he's only 1 month old, but he gets very frustrated when the music and the movement stops after only 2 minutes. This is the year 2003 why do we still have wind up mobiles?"
1,BOR-ING!!!,"When I registered for this product, it was pre-birth of the baby. I wanted it because it would ""match"" the sports theme we had going on in the baby's room. However, my baby was not amused by this mobile at all!I took it back to Babies R'Us and picked up the Tiny Love symphony in motion mobile (see my review on that product).The bear mobile wasn't colorful enough, it plays only one song and lacks movement and excitement. My son is 2 months old and was completely bored by this mobile."
3,Difficult to hook to our crib,The mobile is cute and works fun but was really difficult to hook to our crib. It is not as secure as I would like it to be or as high. Our crib is sleigh style and the mobile would probably be best for a regular syle crib.
3,"Nice, but....","you have to wind it in order to operate, which does not give enough time to keep my son entertained. I chose this mobile because of the nursery theme and bedding, however if I had the chance to pick again I would choose one that is battery operated."
5,BRAVO!! BRAVO!!,"My partner and I have been ballet fans for several decades and, over those years, we have seen many, many Romeo and Juliet performances, both live and recorded. Without question, the one depicted on this DVD is the very best we have seen. In our humble opition, Tamara Rojo has impeccable technique and is without question the best dramatic ballerina in the world. Her Juliet performance on this DVD will serve as a primer for all future ballerinas who dare to tackle Kenneth MacMillan's magnificent choreography. Carlos Acosta matches Tamara's artistic brilliance, and their R&J is pure magic!! By the way, anyone who enjoyed this DVD and has the time and means to visit London may want to know that Tamara and Carlos will be dancing Romeo and Juliet live at Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, in January 2010. See you there!!!"
3,Wonderful music but only fair ballet and poor Romeo,"I know I am in the minority here but I find this ballet disappointing. The music is beautiful and well performed. The sound quality is excellent. The lighting, costumes and other production standards are high. Acosta as Romeo was not to my liking. He is a large, heavily muscled man and thus to me not very graceful. I find the music to this Romeo and Juliet much more exciting than watching the ballet. This is a long production and much of the staging and dancing seemed forced to fit the music. Again just one person's opinion."
2,Very Disappointing,"Great music performed A+. However, the ballet needs a lot more rehearsal. I have never seen a ballet, even in rehearsals, that was so far apart in routines. No synchronized swimming here! Near the end it gets somewhat better. The conductor struggles adjusting tempos to help pull it together but to no avail. Worth the purchase for the music as there are some nuances in the brass that bring out lines normally not so well in focus."
3,Problem with feeding envelopes is very annoying,"I've had this printer for a while now. I have it for home use. I do not need to use it often. For printing on regular sheets of paper and for scanning it is acceptable, although the scanning is very slow. My problem with this printer is that EVERY TIME I try to print an envelope the machine displays a ""PAPER JAM"" error with the instruction to open the door. It takes several attempts to get the machine to take the envelope. It is very annoying.If you decide to buy this machine and you get the ""PAPER JAM"" error when trying to print an envelope, the ""door"" the error message refers to is the panel behind which the toner cartridge is located. And, when you try to print an envelope be sure you open the little plastic panel on the back side of the printer. After the printer prints the envelope, the envelope drops out the back side of the printer."
3,Printer prints at a slight angle,"It took me a couple months to notice, but has anyone noticed that this printer prints slightly at an angle? To fully recognize it I tried printing straight lines across a sheet of paper, and the lines came out slightly angled on the printed sheet. It may not be a big deal to some, but something like this drives me crazy."
5,excellent value,"I bought this multifunction laser printer for my daughter to use at college, and we're very happy with it. I bought this particular model because it received good reviews from several computer magazines, it was relatively inexpensive, it had just the features my daughter wanted, and it was small enough to fit comfortably in a dorm room. I highly recommend it."
1,ATTENTION MAC USERS,"The Samsung SCX-4200 is only partly compatible with Mac OS X_. It prints and copies fine but the scanner does not function as intended. The ScanThru icon will not install, so general scanning is done through Image Capture. Third party software is required to send to another application (photo management) or to perform OCR. Both of these functions are advertised. This additional software requirement for Mac users is not mentioned in the specifications. If you are a Mac user with more than general scanning needs, look for a different multifunction device.Samsung SCX-4200 3-in-1 True Multifunction Printer"
3,So-So,"I am disappointed with the print quality. The very old HP one I use with my PC gives a much sharper image. This is attached to a Mac. Still haven't figured out how to use the scanner to save images. Envelopes don't lie flat after printing unless I'm doing something else wrong. Instructions are limited. Assuming I get all the features to work, I wouldn't recommend because it is not up to my expectation of laser print quality."
1,A Big Disappointment,This was not at all what I had thought it was going to be; therefore I returned it. Amazon had good enough customer relations to give me a full refund.
2,Warmed over..,"This is a classic example of ""a band that never made it big""'s second life. The songs are pretentious and second rate at best. I give it only two stars."
4,Another fun romp with the young werewolves,"""The Werewolf Club #2: The Lunchroom of Doom,"" is a fun entry in this young adult series by Daniel Pinkwater. The book is illustrated by Jill Pinkwater. The story is narrated by Norman Gnormal, a member of the Watson Elementary School Werewolf Club -- a sort of peer support group for kids who are werewolves.This installment brings some interesting new elements into the series -- most notably, Honest Tom's Tibetan-American Lunchroom, were the 'wolves eat lunch. The kids face a naysayer in the form of a narrow-minded Board of Ed psychiatrist who claims that werewolves don't exist. They also discover a fiendish extraterrestrial plot. Good fun, with a nice message of empowerment for kids who are different."
5,Best Eurodance Collection ever,"I had this CD for about 4 years now, and it's still my favorite Compilation ever. It's 100% pure euro-techno and you'll be jumping for joy. My favorite is ICE MC's ""Give me the Light"" which is a track that's produced by Masterboy in which the beat sounds like a Cathedral Vampire beat. Captain Hollywood's ""Love and Pain"" is also produced by Masterboy and it sounds better than ""more & more"". Culture Beat's ""Take me away"" sounds like ""Mr.Vain"" which is also on the CD but better. Outta Control's ""Sinful Wishes"" is the second best song on this CD.If you haven't heard of DJ Bobo,Dr.Alban,Alexia, go out and buy it now.This is better than Vol.4 and Vol.5. The first three were the best but this Vol.3 is the best of all."
4,Worth every cent,Warren Smith just got better and better. Some tracks are not earth shattering but others more than make up for them.
3,doesnt work,"I gave it a long shot, I had a really old alpine head unit but it was only a 1999 with a disc changer connection in the back, it was cheap enough to try but it didnt. oh well im sure it will work for other head units."
5,Beautiful music,"This CD, while hard to get, is a delight to hear. It is simply soothing and upbeat. I play it in my office at work to ease tension and many of my coworkers often comment on how relaxing it is. Most of them ask me where I got it. I tell them Amazon."
1,Horrible,"This is a really horrible textbook, it lacks any obvious method of organization and instead of picking out the most important points every detail is hit making it very hard to focus your attention. Also, if you aren't already familiar with this material you will spend a lot of time doing outside research so that you can clarify terms that are simply presented in this text. I would not recommend this book for anyone looking to learn anything, it simply won't happen."
2,Too Late,"Book ordered for a college class, but took 5 weeks to arrive. Much TOO LATE!!! Had to buy another copy of book. Once book finally arrived, did return and sender very good about refunding money. Shipping method is awful!!! Be careful if you need materials in a timely matter."
1,Not good for university,"This is a horrible text book for university. If you are taking a class using this book, drop it. The book is way too broad. The author seems to get way off topic in most paragraphs. Starts on one subject, talks about three others then concludes on something else. Scattered to say the least. Very difficult to learn from and I spent way too much time researching topics on the internet instead."
4,Good stuff if you like angst-ridden sounding female singers,"Good debut, better than the follow-up 7:11. I only have the UK version so can't rate the last two tracks on this CD. However, stand-out tracks in my opinion are Bowling Night (interesting lyrics: ""She was named after a girl in the local phone book"") and Parsons Green. If you like Beth Orton, you should like this. If you don't know Beth Orton, buy ""Trailer Park"" instead of this as that is a superior product in the same genre."
4,Examples of creative and unusual thinking and actions,"""The Womanly Art of Alligator Wrestling"" is first and foremost a compilation of stories of the experiences of Ana Tampanna. Why are this person's experiences interesting enough to justify reading? Well first of all she demonstrates through her stories the unique ability to rise above challenges, think in a different way, and blaze a path to success where none existed. It is a compilation of examples of highly creative thinking. In addition, Ana writes in a humorous and engaging style that keeps the reader moving along chapter after chapter. A fine collection of inspirational stories it is sure to delight readers looking for examples of ways to think differently and the courage to try something new."
2,"Great product, but expensive....","First, I L*O*V*E Rob bell - he is my favorite pastor and is absolutely awesome in what he is doing up in Grand Rapids.But why the low rated review? Simple: this DVD is $1/minute! The DVD is only 10 minutes long!!!! If they repackaged these ""clips"" into a one DVD set (18 10 minutes long clips would easily fit on one DVD....), and charge around $30, then this would be a great deal. But to buy 18 of these DVDs in order to have the complete set ($180.00!!!) is absurd.So in ending, Rob is a great speaker, these DVD's have relevant and great stories, but they are way too expensive for me."
5,Well worth the cost!!!,"This is an excellent rare collection of Johnny Horton's music!It contains nearly all of the songs that Johnny recorded or thatanyone would care to listen to. All of his hits and many of hisnon-hits (though still interesting songs: i.e., ""Miss Marcy"")are here. Alternate versions of his hits, such as ""Sink theBismarck"" and ""The Battle of New Orleans,"" are also on thiscollection. Additionally, the 124 page biographical booklet,filled with photographs both famous and rare, humanizes theartist in a way that no conventional collection of his greatesthits ever could. A word to the wise: order this collectionused if you can. Not only can you get a reduced price, but youmay have trouble ordering it any other way. Whatever priceyou pay, this collection is well worth the expense!!!"
3,i liked Crazy Machines better,"i like this game - it's different from Crazy Machines in the way it's laid out. this game is certainly more geared towards kids, (i'm guessing, due to colorful graphics) and i think that's really cool. it gets them to think about things. it's a little different from Crazy Machines in that you get to make more contraptions. that being said, about the only thing i disliked about Incredible Machine is the irritating background music!!! the thing that i hated is that you can't make it play just one song throughout the entire game- it changes music throughout the levels and alot of the choices are very bothersome in my opinion. LOLi like these types of games though because you certainly do get your money's worth in reference to the amount of gameplay for the money.all in all, this is a very colorful, thought provoking game, but i prefer Crazy Machines. ;)"
2,Get it from the library first,"I thought, before investing in another knitting book, I'd preview this one from the library, and I'm glad I did. the sweaters are gorgeous, but the instructions would take way too much time to decipher. Also, if there's a gauge, I couldn't find it. All she lists is one specific yarn. I'm not investing $80 or $90 in yarn that won't work, especially not over the internet.So, if you're looking for the history of aran knitting, if you're looking to do some experimentation, this wold fit the bill. But for most knitters who've grown up since the 1960's, check it out from the library before you invest.It is, BTW, a lovely book."
2,A book designed for only extremely experienced knitters.,"Alice Sizemore does a very nice job explaining the history of Aran knitting. She also gives good examples of what different patterns should look like. The sweater patterns presented in the book totally ignore the average knitter who needs more guidance and better explained directions. Overall, I found the book to be rather disappointing. I love knitting Aran pattern sweaters, but I still need thorough well explained directions."
4,A short release that includes one of her greatest songs.,"The title track is from her 1998 album, ""from the choirgirl hotel."" Along with three color postcards, this single includes her unique cover of Steely Dan's ""Do it Again"" (a song fans continue to ask her to play live, but she has yet to supply). It also includes one of her best songs she has written to date"" ""Cooling."" Originally written for her 1996 album, ""Boys for Pele,"" ""Cooling"" is a beautiful composition highlighting Tori's ethereal and beautiful voice, immense talent on the piano, and poetic way with lyrics. It takes you to the core of who Tori Amos is, and afterward all you can think about is travelling through it again. It may go in through your ears, but it goes straight to your heart, never letting its relentless beauty escape from its new found home."
4,Slightly Misleading but Good Nonetheless,"The actual translation of the treatise ""Dirayat Al-Hadith"" is only about 25 pages long. The other 250 pages or so are a recent guide to the study of Hadith not written by Al-Shahid Al-Thani. Worth reading nonetheless to get an idea of how hadith are graded."
3,Printmaster Platinum #17,"I guess it's okay. I have the original Printmaster Platinum and think its the greatest. The newer version is okay, somewhat more confusing to use and didn't have the graphics in it that I had hoped for. Guess I'll get used to it but glad I didn't remove my previous version."
2,Not as user friendly as the old one,"I found PrintMaster Plantinum ver.17 less user friendly than my older version. It may be due tothe fact that I don't seem tohave the ""program"" CD with my set and have yet to be unable to use most of the components. I have also encountered a scrolling problem when in the photo & clipart gallery.I wish I could have just replace the art CD 4 to my old program instead of spending $35.00 on something I can't even use now.Wish I could get my money back and find something different to create signs, flyers and cards with."
1,Pure Junk,"I've used various versions of Printmaster for several years and liked this application alot. Unfortunately I have yet to be able to create anything with version 17, even after multiple installations and many emails to ""customer support"" which was nothing more than a half-witted cut-and-paste reply telling me to retry installation, etc.Printmaster used to be good, but this version is a waste of time and money. Shame on Broderbund for making something that was once very useful and fun totally worthless and frustrating. I will never buy another Broderbund product."
2,Printmaster 17 platinum,"This program is easy to use and has lots of projects. I am only giving it a 2 because the advertising is deceptive. It says there are over 200,000 graphics and 1000's of templates but it does not tell you 90% of them are only available online. Also, there is NO CUSTOMER SUPPORT. No matter who you contact they just tell you to contact someone else."
2,Less is NOT more.,"I've used Printmaster 12 platinum on DVD and liked it well enough but the disk wore out. I knew from reviews of subsequent versions that Broderbund was giving us less and less but even still I was stunned by just how much less. Where are all the projects? Even counting the online projects there just isn't much here for anyone. For kid's masks, version 12 has at least a dozen but this version gives you 2! The cards are terrible - many are just small clipart images with a white background. (At least you won't need much ink). In short, if you want to create anything decent you'll have to design it yourself. Inspired by the ONE nice-looking cut-out card, I was able to search the art work and create several nice cards that I would be pleased to send."
1,Print Master Platinum 17 a waste of money,I have used lots of PrintMaster versions I had some trouble with version 16 with the address book so I was happy to find that a new version was out and called to order they told me I wouldn't have a problem with the new one. This new version is JUNK; all the projects have to be downloaded so if you don't have a high speed connection forget it! I don't like the fact that you have to go on line every time you want to create a card etc. I sent a note to customer service and just received a generic response. So looks like I have to find new software.
1,"Crashes, won't access disk, a terrible program. No support, either.","Junk. I had to reinstall over and over before I could even get it to recognize the disk that had the art work! Other artwork is only available via download, so if you have a modem, watch out. I emailed support a week ago and guess what: no answer yet."
1,too slow,"I like the Printmaster Gold 16 MUCH better, the new one takes way to long to come up and make projects. I find myself putting in the old one all the time. I wasted my money."
1,Deep River,"I am very disappointed in this program. I have been doing my own graphics/cards for about 10 years. I started with Print Shop (early edition) and progressed thru all the updates. I then switched to PrintMaster and LOVED it!!! Again, I have progressed to each new verion with very little or no problems...until now! This has got to be the worst of the worst--- the program did not want to load without being babied. When it finally loaded, it was very confusing and I found that I needed to get my graphics from the internet! The area I live in only allows me to have dial up---you can imagine how long it takes to get the graphics I want! If you are interested in doing your own graphics/cards, skip this program...go back to PrintMaster Platinum 16 for much better results. As far as I am concerened, the River Deep Company needs to hide this edition in the DEEPEST RIVER they can find!"
1,Disappointed,"I have been using American Greetings Creatacard Platinum 8 for several years and really liked the program. I wanted to add some variety since I felt I was running out of sentiments and graphics that I haven't used yet. Well, I was very disappointed with Printmaster. Their sentiments are VERY weak..they simply say Happy Birthday and that is all on many of them. The graphics are also pretty poor, I expected a more professional looking graphic. The program is not very easy to use. I am actually just continuing to use my other program as that one is so superior. Waste of my money to buy this program."
2,Wait for Version 18?,"Version 18 is on the horizon - it is listed in the ""Workd with Windows Vista"" listing Microsoft publishes, so it is coming soon. Maybe this will solve some of the nightmares everyone mentions."
1,JUNK! GARBAGE! The Fry's Salesperson >>>LIED<<< TO ME,"You've GOT to be kidding me. The Fry's salesperson told me Microsoft Word couldn't print business cards and that I should buy this product to make high quality business cards.What an incredible lie.This is such a piece of junk. It has almost nothing. The cards look TERRIBLE, a total embarassment. It's HARD TO USE, it's easier to make it in Word.LIES LIES LIES JUNK GARBAGE LIES LIES LIES"
5,Moominvalley in November: A Multi-level tale,"I have yet to find anyone under the age of 25 who has read the Moomin series, unless they were introduced to Jansson's superlative works by an ""adult."" Where were these books when I was eleven? The texture of this particular book in the series is delightfully multi-layered, and only gets better with repeated reading. 5, or 105, you'll always find something pleasant, thoughtful, perhaps even hauntingly provoking in all of Jansson's works--and Moominvalley in November is Jansson at her best!"
2,ehh....save your money,"AntiFreeze's "" Four Letter Words "" is a huge dissapointment. #1 when this band was found ( by Kris Roe of the Ataris ) owners of Kung Fu Recrods and Kris were looking for the next ""Ataris"". How lame is that? Second off...Iam not a huge Ataris fan but even the Ataris have a good cd. Antifreeze has talent but lacks any sense of lyrcial direction. Its all the same..every song about girls! The music has talent but it is much to alike to The Ataris and how ironic..its produced by Kris Roe. Bottomline..its nothing great..not even average. SAVE YOUR MONEY...they are great guys and a good live band but record wise...they are weak! go buy some AFI, Rancid, At the Drive In or a great pop punk band on kung fu with a great sound, Useless I.D."
1,not great,"ok i bought this cd because of 2 things i heard ""ordinary"" and it was produced by kris roe (ataris) so i thought i may aswell give it a go.Unfortunately it didnt live up to expectations, im not disputing these guys talent at all, they can definately play their instruments but unfortunately it really lacks one thing, a decent vocalist. lots of songs you just find the lyrics soft and with no attitude some where in the background, which his rather lame for a punk band trying to get a story or message across. i say if you dont own any ataris cds yet go buy ""end is forever"" or ""blue skies broken hearts next 12 exits"" before this."
4,from the cover,"How much time and energy do we spend wishing things were how they used to be? We often think about times in our past when things were different and want our lives to be like that again. Some of us have even come to believe that our best days may actually be behind us. But if we're in some way hung up on the past, what does that mean for our lives now? How are we and those around us affected if we're not fully present? If we're longing for the way things used to be what does that really say about our understanding and appreciation of our lives today? Maybe we need to learn to embrace our past for what it is, in order to live our lives to the fullest, right here, right now."
4,One More Sunday,"What do you think about ""evangelists?"" Are they all on the up and up? Or, are they pretending to be for the Heavenly hosts, all the while grasping all available monies from the unwashed masses? John D. really lets it all hang out with this novel."
3,Mystery product,"I really loved the way this watch looked online. But unfortunately when I recieved the watch, I found that it had an animated Surfer on the face of the watch that could not be turned off. The watch itself is really nice, but I would have preferred to be informed of the animation before purchase. It would have saved some time and mnoney on my part, as I had to return the watch."
1,Great LSU flag,"Great LSU flag, ordered as a graduation gift for a avid Tiger fan, just as it appeared in picture. Would order again!"
2,"Nice and Easy, but TOO fragile.","I bought this item about 2 weeks ago, and installation was easy enough, however, after 1 week the product was flaky...it wouldn't connect without a little 'jiggling'. Now it comes up with a message saying that the usb device is malfuntioning.On further inspection it is really cheaply made which is why I think this one sells for $9 instead of $19-40 as others like Belkins and Dlinks do. I would recommend spending a few dollars more for one that is not so fragile.Also, for reference, I am a computer technician, and am a stickler for quality."
2,not worth your time.,"I tried this out of curiousity. It doesn't connect reliably enough times nor does it do what i want it to do. Skip this product and buy from a reputable manufacturer, you'll be saving yourself all the frustration.-K"
2,does work for long,"cheap on the price means cheap on the quality. the dongle is not even the same one in the picture. mine black and much smaller, rounder. stopped working after a few months."
3,"Decent strings, but very bright ""A""","I got these strings to replace a set of very worn out Evah Pirazzi's that had ashamedly been on my violin for nearly four years. Now that they've settled in, I'd say that they're pretty good strings, especially in comparison to the old ones which should have been replaced three years ago. Bearing this in mind, however,the A string seems a little too bright (it was obnoxiously so at first)- which was disappointing because I purchased these ""bright"" strings after reading in several places that they would be a good match for my darker sounding violin. I have not yet tried the E that came with the set as I opted to try the pirastro gold E that seems so popular (and it seems to complement the set rather nicely). Considering the price, these aren't bad strings, but they didn't do any wonders for my late 1880's, dark sounding German violin either."
5,Excelente producto,"Las cuerdas Vision son bastante buenas, se usan para nivel profesional.El vendedor es super responsable y el envío no es costoso ya que las cuerdas pesan poco.Me llegaron en muy buen estado a Venezuela, pues las envuelven muy bien para su traslado.Te envian el SET COMPLETO de 4 CUERDAS.¡Recomiendo el producto y al vendedor!"
5,Fast Shipping!!!!!,"I order these strings and two days later, their here. The shipping is fast and the product is good. Five stars!"
5,Animal Crossing,"I played Animal Crossing on the gamecube and I loved it instantly!! I heard that a newer version had come out on the DS but was dissapointed. My parents hated those little handheld game consoles because they thought the screen was too small and it supposedly spoiled the eyes.My friend forced me to play the game on her DS and I was amazed by how large the screen on the DS was and the game was awesome!! You are able to change your hairstyle now and you don't have to wear a friggin hat all the time. My parents after seeing the ""large"" screen bought it for me. It's very good. I totally recommend it!!!"
1,Olympus D-590,"Had the camera 2 weeks when the battery retainer clip failed (fell off). Mailed it back to Olympus for a warranty fix. After a few weeks of waiting for a promised call that never came, I got an e-mail telling me that the failure was my fault and the fix would cost $146. The camera was used for 2 weeks and cost $227!! I called them back and pled my case to no avail. I am now awaiting the return of my Olympus reject. If I can't find a local shop to repair it reasonably I will toss it and start over. Expensive lesson learned: AVOID OLYMPUS. LOUSY PRODUCT, WORSE PR"
4,Breastfeeding Mom gives this a thumbs up!,"I read all of the reviews on this book and despite numerous warnings that it ""wasn't for a breastfed baby"", I purchased it.By 10 weeks he was sleeping through the night with only a diaper change around 1am. We have since learned to change his diaper at 11:00pm right after my last pump and he sleeps till 6:30am. It is common sense, adults learn that they are going to get all of their food during the day so essentially that is what you are teaching your baby. There is no starving! My son gets 28oz of breast milk a day, the difference is that instead of him ""snacking"" every 2-3 hours, he eats once every 4 hours, 4x a day.My son is now 3 months old, exclusively breastfed and he sleeps through the night. I love this book. It is straight forward, uses common sense and most of all, possible!"
1,what a waste of paper,"If the author even knew anything about breastfeeding they would understand that each women's capacity of breastmilk is different. Some women need to nurse their baby ALL the time for short periods of time and some women can feed less for longer periods of time. Putting a time frame on feeding is dangerous and every mom and baby is different.Babies aren't meant to be convienent or easy but they are life changing, life altering human beings who will need to eat more then 4 times a day...can you imagine if you were only allowed to eat 4 times a day?"
5,This book is awesome,"I've read some of the negative reviews on this book, and was shocked. The book really worked for us. Our daughter was sleeping through the night at 10 weeks (and I am a breastfeeding mom). Personally, I've adjusted the time to 10 hours (I was grateful for that) instead of the 12 hours because I wanted to spend more time with my child in the mornings. Really, it's a great book. I know there are some problems with the 4 feedings concept, but my baby eats the same amount (she just started to eat more in the 4 feedings than she did in the 6 or 8 feedings). The techniques really worked right away, if you follow them correctly. I don't think the book is neglectful; the author worked with a medical doctor. Our daughter is on this schedule and is thriving and healthy and doing well. If she wasn't, her weight would be declining, but it's not. I think this book is wonderful; it saved us and I highly recommend it."
1,Breastfeeding sabotage,"I am a pediatrician. If you are a breastfeeding mother, this book is NOT for you (I don't really think it's formula-feeding babies either, but especially not for breastfeeding babies). Breastfed babies should NOT be fed every 4hrs, and most should NOT sleep for 12hrs at night. That is not the way breastfeeding works (for the baby or the mama), and if you are going to try to make it work like that, your breastfeeding relationship will not survive. Don't do this to yourself and your baby. Breastfeeding is so important -- I see every day that breastfed babies are healthier. It's unrealistic to expect babies to sleep 12hrs at night, and if you are expecting that, you are going to make yourself and your baby miserable. For heaven's sake, just FEED THE BABY!! Your hard work will pay off! I promise. : )"
1,Doesn't deserve a star,"You're trying to teach a newborn to be courteous of other family members? That's such a joke! This is an unrealistic book, it will no doubt lead to failure to thrive and supply problems for breastfeeding moms."
1,unrealistic....,"I think that this is a bad book for breastfeed babies and very unrealistic...As a new mom, I was searching for a solution to the every two hours night feedings and my brother saw the auther of this book on a tv program. So I gave it a shot. First, as a new mom, I dont expect not to get up to breastfeed during the night...does anyone expect this???? if so then they should consider formula. I just want to get my son to sleep for 4-5 hours at a time and get a good nap in (he takes 5 naps at 30-45 minutes opposed to 3 naps at 1.5 hours). this book is for formula babies if that. And logically isnt every baby different??? to generalize that every baby can be put on this progam is ridiculous. Lastly, it talks about training your baby for the first six months and plan on not going out to dinner, traveling, ect...basically not living a life for six months...again unrealistic."
1,may not be healthy for infants,"After reading this book and watching my niece struggle through this ""program"" I contacted my pediatrician and a family friend who is a pediatrician about the theories set forth in this book. Both agreed that this program is NOT healthy for infants and parents should speak to their physicians before starting this ""step-by-step plan""."
2,Know your baby first!,"Every baby is a little different and may have needs for sleeping and eating that do not fit into this plan. This book wears your baby out until he/she submits to sleeping at night.My daughter was happier eating more often during the day. That's better for adults so it follows that babies would digest several meals a day more easily than just four big ones.Also, the activity time in this book wore me out! You can't leave a baby this young unattended and with just 3 hours naptime built into the day I hardly ate (much less did the laundry)!Read the book if you can get a used copy. Take from it only what you need and disregard the rest."
1,Disturbing...,"I haven't read this book, but I was browsing through and found it. The title is disturbing. A newborn, even at 3 months, needs to eat at least every 3-4 hours. I don't know how the author proposes to keep a child asleep even when they are hungry, but I hope it doesn't involve reverting to formula instead of breastmilk just so the parents can sleep a little more."
5,Great book on sleep for babies! Wish I would have bought it sooner...and with my first child!,This book is perfect for parents trying to get some sleep at night for the well-being of the parents and child.
5,Great Book,"Thank God, I just happened to come across this book. I was pregnant when I bought it, reviewed it quickly during that time, and re-read it after having my baby. I just went right to the schedule page and tried to follow it the best I could when my baby was only 6 weeks old. He was the right weight, so I decided to start early. By week 8 my baby was sleeping through the night. It took one week to stop the 12midnight, feeding and another week to stop the 4am feeding. He adopted the new system well. And I am the only person I know that had such a young baby sleeping 12 hours thru the night. Get this book, it will make your life so much better. It really helped me....a mom who needs her sleep!"
2,If you breastfeed think twice before buying,"Honestly, I quit reading it when she was talking about slowly restricting how many ounces of milk to feed your baby at night. My breasts do not keep an ounce tally! And, I am not going to formula feed or pump all day king just so I can make sure I'm restricting ounces. Also, there's no way I'll be giving my baby enough milk by just 4 feedings alone. When I do pump, it's rare I get 6 oz unless I'm engorged. And, when I'm engorged and pump, I notice that 2 of the 6 iz is straight foremilk which makes my baby miserable so I usually dump the first 2 oz. anyway, I was very disappointed."
1,Horrible Book,"I honestly am shocked to see this book getting positive reviews. The advice given flies in the face of the recommendations of the American Academy of Pediatrics, the World Health Organization, and every other medical organization there is. A breastfed baby needs to eat a MINIMUM of 8 times per day. Formula-fed babies eat less, but more than 4 times! I feel so bad for those poor babies who are forced to go hungry and cry alone at night because their parents are more concerned with getting enough sleep than with their children's needs. How does this sort of thing even get published? If you want your child to sleep through the night, read The No-Cry Sleep Solution by Elizabeth Pantley. Pantley's methods may take a bit longer to work, but they do not require you to neglect your child in order to get them to sleep."
5,Practical sound advice that worked for me and several of my friends!,"I read all ""the books"" ... Babywise, The Contented Baby, and more. This book was the only one that combined a lot of the good advice with a more humane approach to CIO (resticted CIO).While I didn't follow the night weaning schedule to a tee, I thought the notion of creating the ""right"" sleeping environment, giving babies time to ""figure it out"" and finally, believing in your child's ability to sleep were right on the money. My daughter was sleeping by 5 months and is am amazing napper. People always comment on what a good baby she is, which I attribue to her ample sleep.Thank you, Suzy!! I've actually coached many of my friends though your approach and they thank you too."
2,Wasn't for me,"After a couple months of trouble putting my daughter to sleep I was desperate to find a solution. I researched night after night (awake due to my daughter) to find the best solution to give me relief. I gave this book a try as a result of the reviews. I read the entire book, thought about for a few nights and decided the philosophy was not for me. I understood it, it made sense, it sounded great, but just wasn't for us. I have tried to put my daughter down while awake, let her cry and it never got better. Once she was 3 months putting her down got easier, but with my method, not this one. This just wasn't something I could stomach after the first try, and I'm not one of those moms that's overly sensitive to jumping at every cry. So am I in a position to recommend, not really, but I can tell you I was desperate and in need of a good nights sleep and I still could not do this."
4,Life Changing AND my baby is THRIVING,"My baby now sleeps 12-13 hours a night. This book was instrumental in this process. She LOVES sleep and needs it. She now knows how to self-soothe. Anyone who says their baby won't thrive with a 4-hour feeding schedule is being a bit dramatic. This is a very simple concept, though I agree that with breastfeeding it is difficult to measure how much the baby is eating, so pumping is necessary. If you feel that this takes time from your baby breastfeeding directly from you, then it may not be the right book for you. For me, the tradeoff with pumping was worth her sleeping 12 hours through the night for the past 5 months (she's 8 months now). She wakes up happy and not crying. She naps an hour after she wakes up. What more could you ask for? Is this selfish?"
5,The Book is a Godsend!!!,This book was an absolute Godsend!!!!!!!! My son took to it right away even though he was five months when we started it. Still learning a little bit here and there but doing great. This book saved my sleeplife lol.
4,Has a promising outlook,"Her approach makes logical sense, however, it does not tell me how to get my child to eat 24 ounces (one of the factors before you should start her method). I break the seal to have my daughter keep eating, but we are at 12 weeks old and still not eating 24 ounces. So we are trying to get our daughter on a schedule but we still have nightly feedings because she is not eating 24 ounces total including the night time feedings. It is promising but I don't have results yet. Oh her website that she says to visit for more information is worthless unless you want to pay her."
2,Didn't work for me...,"This method doesn't work if you are nursing exclusively, unless you are willing to pump 5-6 times each day."
1,Dangerous advice!,"This book goes against everything that every doctor, nurse, and lactation consultant has ever advised me--- please check with your pediatrician before following this! I'm certain he/she will advise you against this method!!"
3,so so,"This book does make sense in someway, however, by 12 weeks is too early. Also, not much help for a breastfeeding mother."
2,Not feasible,"The book is well written. And it probably works for those parents who are organized or ambitious enough to do it. I, however, am not one of those parents. I stress out over parenting to begin with. This book suggests measuring breast milk for the middle of night feedings. I am not willing to do that. It may work for formula babies. Also, I am not sure going 12 hours between feedings is good for breast feeding."
1,How is this not child abuse?,"The book recommends teaching a tiny baby to ""get used to being hungry"" by feeding only every 4 hours.Never mind that it's not biologically normal for young infants to sleep for 12 hours straight, why would anyone be willing to make their child suffer to accomplish that goal?If you're feeling desperate about getting sleep, try ""The No Cry Sleep Solution""[...]"
5,This really works!,"I started reading this book after my baby was born and thought I would at least try it out. Well, it took about 16 weeks (not 12), but my boy started to sleep from 7pm to 7am almost every night. All of my friends with babies are amazed. The book is a very easy read, even for the most sleep deprived new mom. The philosophy is very simple... give your baby enough food during the day so he will sleep all night. It all really came together for us at 16 weeks, which I am very happy about."
4,helpful,"Easy read. I haven't stuck to it religiously and am not in a hurry to get my child to sleep twelve hours but the book does contain many helpful tips. The plan seems to make a lot of sense for formula-fed babies. With breastfed babies it's a little harder to stick to her ""baby boot camp"". Does not address milk supply issues in great depth. It does help us keep a basic schedule during the day so that we can reliably plan our days without worrying about when baby has to eat/sleep. I'd recommend it."
2,great in theory,My baby was absolutely miserable on this plan. Sure we had a routine but he was starving...4 hours is too hard for some newborns. My baby is formula fed and even he couldn't do it. I went back to a 3-hour regimen and he was much happier.
1,Absolutely a waste of money and time!,"I bought this software at Walmart for about $10. I was excited, being the language lover I am. But when I got home and started the program, I was gravely disappointed.Sure, people who see this may think, ""Wow! A program with 31 languages! How rare!"" Exactly. Maybe the problem with the program is that the languages aren;t given special considerations s to how different they are and each language takes different techniques to learn them. The interface is confusing and there is no true beginning to the program. A complete beginner in a language will be LOST.I would give 0 stars if that were an opption. I think Amazon should make that an otion, because giving this program even half of a star would be too much.It's better to take classes, read books, and just talk to people for practice, and watch films. (This from experience.)"
2,not a good program,"I was given this program as a gift when I decided I wanted to learn to speak Spanish.First off, it's too advanced for a beginner. Secondly, when doing the crosswords, the words are either too easy (the) or too hard.My husband wanted to learn Finnish and the sound wouldn't load.The program is very quirky and gets stuck or even crashes at times. I think it's not overly compatible with operating systems more advanced than Windows 95."
3,Star Control: Interbellum,"What the hell was Quick thinking?!?!?! It's an okay book, but he got a lot of things wrong. First of all, the Illwrath are loathsome, hellish, worshipping spiders! Not little toy soldiers. And the Mycon aren't sentient. If Quick writes another book about SC, he better play the game first."
3,Not as colorful as the picture,"I ordered this as a Christmas gift for a family member. He has a similar spoon that used to have bright, vivid colors, but is now grungy looking since he uses it as a coffee scoop. I was disappointed when this spoon arrived because the colors are not nearly as bright as they look in the picture or in other, similar products. If I had to do it all over again, I think I would order something else."
2,"Engaging, Thought Provoking","This book represesnts a refreshing exploration of the principal doctrines behind Christianity and Buddhism. Each conversation is set in the style of a Socratic Dialog, and can at times be a little tough to get through. The book never promotes one tradition over another, yet it seeks rather to find similarities and build on those. That having been said, it is also far from the best book in the genre. In the author's zeal to marry the traditions of Buddhism with Christianity she waters down both to such a degree that one might come away thinking that theological and philosophical principles can be entirely summed up by the list of over-used quotes in the back of the book. For a real discussion on this subject that does more than merely scratch the surfaces of both traditions and offers real insights instead of the same banal clichés try reading one of Thich Nhat Hanh's books instead."
1,Cheap looking and very poor quality,This ankle bracelet looks like jewlery one could purchase at a Dollar Store. Very poor quality. I send it back to the seller as soon as I received it.
4,A Great Deed Indeed,"I found The Deed Of Paksenaarion , A duanting read. The story itself was An exciting ride but somewhat Predictable once one read the intro and followed the signs. But seeing what was coming was part of the enjoyment of the story. You constantly Root for PAKS as she evolves from a simple defiant Farm girl to Soilder and then too....(well to say what she eventually becomes would spoil it.) but she earns what she becomes thru trials and tribulations that would break anyone else. She finds friend among the Tolkien races that you find in most fantasy stories and and gains your typical Overwhwleminly evil enemies and loses friends in more ways then one. Too end this if you read this far i would say expect you long segways and alot of characther development and a little of your fantasy cliches' but it will be a great experience and a good re-read."
2,The Dud of Paksenarrion,"This is one of the few epic fantasy novels that I've not even bothered to finish. If you keep hoping the story will get better, you should not even start. The main character is boring, hackneyed and (as another reviewer put it) completely sexless. The plot is straight out of a D&D session, the supporting cast interchangable, and the world lacks any depth whatsoever. Try Robin Hobb, Steven Erikson, or R Scott Bakker for some new-er voices in fantasy that due justice to the genre."
2,:^(,"Boy, what a LETDOWN!!!! I expected something much better. The first and third books are okay, but the second one has NO POINT! If you STILL want to read this book, then just buy the 1st and 3rd ones. Then, and ONLY then go ahead and buy he 2nd if you REALLY want to."
1,dull,"struggling with this book.....written like a child might write e,g. ' she did this and then they did that......'"
1,Redundant and Generally Boring,"I found ""The Deed of Paksenarrion"" to be encredibly redundant in the story line. The auther kept putting the main character in basically the same situations over and over, and having her escape agian and again. I found I had to force myself to continue reading for fear of falling asleep. I think all three books could have been compacted into one 400 (at most) page book. I would not recomend this book."
3,"Good, but yet derivative.","I admit to having very mixed feelings about ""Deed of Paksenarrion."" I've ripped through the first book in a matter of hours, and was so excited that I ran out and bought the compilation volume the very next day. Then, Paksenarrion started to become a Paladin, and that's where my AD&D playing days came back to haunt me. ""Ah, there is Protection from Evil, 10'....and Healing touch..and the paladin's steed. And a half-elven magic user. And the 12th level druid..uh-oh."" If Elisabeth Moon just chose to make the resemblace a little less apparent, I would've gladly given the book a 5 star rating. There were some very, very good moments (all of the first book, and the latter half of the 2nd), but in the end I was left less then satisfied."
5,A true Palidan,This book is great for all those people who like roleplaying games. It shows you how to play a True Palidan and what kind of hardship on must go through to prove your faith.
5,A page turner!,This is my favorite trilogy and I had read it twice already (before Kindle). I was so happy to find it available for Kindle! I had not known I was buying the whole trilogy but thought the 8.99 was well worth it. How delighted I was when I realized I had all three books. Anyone that likes Epic Fantasy tales will enjoy this trilogy. The action continues from book to book and you'll be glad you don't have to run out and buy the second and third book as you finish the first.
4,Wonderful trilogy but this version is too bulky,"I absolutely love this series. This is one of my favorite book series. Love, love, love The Deed of Paksenarrion!The only reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, is because this book is too bulky. Especially if you like to read lying in bed like I do. I prefer buying and reading the individual books which I also purchased. But I guess buying this version does save you a little money."
4,"You will ride, fight, and cry with Paksenarrion!","This trilogy follows the life and trials of Paksenarrion, a sheepherder's daughter who wants to be a soldier. Through her training and her subsequent campaigns accompanied by the tough as nails sergent Stammel and her best friends Saben and Canna, they follow the mercenary captain Duke Phelan in the quest for gold and a bit of justice. You live with her as Elizabeth Moon takes you through trials and tribulations until her dreams of glory become a little tarnished by the real world. The only problem I have with this excellent book is that the last 50 or so pages become mechanical as the human and flawed Paksenarrion I cried and cheered for as the underdog trying with all her heart to be better, becomes perfect.The story will grip you, the writing descriptive without being flowery, and Paksenarrion is the unique character you wish you could have for a friend.A great read!"
5,AWESOME!,"Elizabeth Moon does a wonderfull job! I could not put this book down, I highly recomend this to any and all fantasy readers!!"
4,Classic Fantasy with a (believable) female lead,"Elizabeth Moon's Trilogy (available in one book or seperately) the Deed of Paksenarrion tracks the progress of Paks from simple sheepherd's daughter to Paladin and great heroine. Moon's writing style is pacy and addictive and her charaters are believable and likeable, the authors time in the Military certainly gave her insight into the life of the soldier and officer. As a soldier myself I often found myself chuckling over certain characters in the books as they reminded me of colleaguesalso check out her truly excellent SF series the Serrano Legacy, now, I mean it, now!"
5,The Deed of Paksenarrion,Was glad to find it in hardback at a great price. My husband had read his paperback to tatters. He loved his Christmas gift.
3,Paksennarion,"Ms. Moon does seem to have problems with tight plotting and purposeful character development, but I have to recommend this book anyway. Any time an author can bring me to tears (nay, cause me to sob) for a character, I'm impressed. I have rarely cried over a book, but have laughed aloud often. The book does bog down now and then, and I wanted her to get her elf mail back. The trip to Luap's stronghold ended up as a device to get her into the dark elves' hands. So many big things were left unfinished, still there is ample here to cause you to gasp in surprise."
3,"A good read! (better than 3 stars, but not a 4 star)","Moon struck gold with The Deed of Paksenarrion.Its a fairly predictable story, but Moon weaves it in such a way to make things feel fresh. The middle section tends to drag I feel, but its essential to the story.I recommend this to anybody that really loves fantasy."
3,Disappointed,"Shipped on time and in condition described. Unfortunately, the book smelled like cigarette smoke, a detail that should have been disclosed. Disappointed, and would not buy from this seller again."
3,OK but No Middle Earth!!,I was hoping to get into the magical world of Middle Earth but couldn't find the door here. It's fun to read a book about a strong female character but this is in no way close to Tolkien's Fantastic World. Saying she is the heir to Tolkien is a gross overstatement and I am glad that I had bought it used for 5 bucks. This book feels more sci-fi style less fantasy in her presentation of dialogue and character develpment. So I continue my quest for Middle Earth and will re-read LOTR yet again.
5,OK at First - loved it later,"The first time I read Paks, I thought it was OK, but not great. Liked it enough to keep it in my library (donated a LOT of books over the years that weren't worth re-reading). The second time, several years later, I got a lot more out of it. I have now read it several times and it is one of my favorite books/series. The interplay between action (swords), mystery (magic) and the power of faith and love in this series is among the best I've read. When I was younger, caught up in my life and ignoring God, the portions dealing with faith bored and confused me. As I have drawn closer to God, and depend upon Jesus to make it through the day, I really appreciate how faith is depicted in this series."
4,missing pages/ repeated pages,"loving the book, not loving the missing pages - pg 71-102 or the repeated pages pg 103 - 134, did any body else have this problem?"
2,Not much story,"I love fantasy, and after reading all the rave reviews was anxious to read this trilogy. I kept waiting for the story to begin. It is so far,it is just one long detailed battle after another. No story. I am very disappointed. I suppose if battle detail interests a reader they will like this trilogy. I have put it down, tired of slogging along waiting for something other than war detail to emerge. Perhaps if I keep at it...I haven't finished it."
2,Over Rated,I would suggest this book only for hard core military fans. I was shocked by how boring I found this book after I read all the glowing reviews on this site. It is not a terrible book but two stars is being very generous in my opinion. The action didn't even start until about 350 pages in and I think the book was way too long. I don't see myself purchasing another book by Elizabeth Moon.
3,Solid but incomplete,"I found the Deed of Paksenarrion to be solid fantasy with a disappointing ending. To its credit, the details of military life seem quite realistic, as do the battle scenes. It has engaging plot elements, and interesting twists and turns. Unfortunately, it leaves several key plot points unfinished. Perhaps these were meant to be resolved in some future, unannounced sequel. A dozen more pages could have wrapped up those elements to make the book far more satisfying. Also, I found unnecessary repetition of elements a little tedious, with stories retold several times, though from different characters' viewpoints. Finally, I feel that the testimonial on the inside cover page, comparing Moon to Tolkein is an absolute sham; There is nowhere near the backstory, depth of character, or plot of the master. Still, it's not a bad read."
5,ONE OF THE BEST I HAVE READ IN YEARS,"This book is simply one of the best pieces of fiction I have read in years. Elizabeth Moon is truely a story teller and this is a very, very good story! I did read with interest some of the ""bad"" reviews listed here and for the most part the reviewers were much more concerned with sounding ""intellectual"" themselves, rather than simply enjoying a good work. Suggest they take Eng. 101 over again, and or drop their X-Box playing for a few days. This is rather sad. Ms. Moon's character development is wonderful - you truely feel you know the individual when she finishes. I am not certain that I could or would compare Moon's work with other authors. That is a trap far too many reviewers fall into. I do feel, that if you did not enjoy this work, you should probably read it again and try to figure out what you are missing. I do wish that Moon would contunue the story in one form or another. I was sorry to see the story end!"
2,Not a good product,"Paperport 10 is a major disappointment. I've used earlier versions and they have been useful and easy to use. Not so with Paperport 9 and Paperport 10--they frequently crash, and are terribly slow. But what is really galling is that ScanSoft CHARGES a more than nominal fee for even the simplest technical advice (""Why does this software keep crashing""?)If you've got money to burn, Paperport 10 will gladly oblige with a bonfire."
5,What a Ride!!!,"You don't really have to understand or appreciate marching band to hughely appreciate the dynamics and showmanship of BLAST! It was revolutionary to bring this type of show to the stage in London, New York and in many touring shows at many venues. To have this music available on CD to listen at any time is truly a rousing joy.Don't miss out........get your copy and enjoy a group of extremely talented musicians show their stuff."
4,Get Blasted!,"Wow! Very entertaining and exciting! Present and former band members alike won't be the only folks impressed by this ensemble's work. High energy and stage spectacle are easy to recall with this recording. After seeing the show on Broadway last week I got the CD, and the only disappointment was the snare feature omission. Other than that, the CD is great, as is the show - see it before it leaves the stage if you can."
3,"Great, but missing some things","In this CD i very much enjoyed everything except what i had expected to hear. Mainly i am talking about ""Battery Battle"". I remember from the PBS specials and from the VHS that there was one, and it probably wasn't included on the cd because they are technically solos even though most of the drummers participate. This single ""movement"" was the transition point into ""Medea"" and so the cd connects less and feels shorter. I never saw Blast live, but some who saw it heard other songs that i wasn't even aware of. it would be nice to get what you paid for in a cd, but until then, this cd should satisfy."
5,WOW!,I actually first saw this on KPBS and they were spectacular. The song malguena is absolutely wonderful and my high school band played it. This is awesome.Tuba Rocks!!
2,"Surprisingly melodramatic for a CD entitled ""Blast""","After seeing the end of the PBS documentary, I expected a lot more ""Blast"" in this CD, especially a lot more BRASS. Instead almost every song is slow to develop and somewhat kitchy in its mix of instruments... from minor percussion instruments to obviously re-mixed (ie; quieted) brass and sound effects. It was obviously recorded in a studio, detracting from its energy and power... the live show seemed a lot better. Perhaps the reason is this CD isn't meant to be listened to, but SEEN. Afterall, it is classified as a soundtrack. I give it a 2... not because of the musicians, but because of underwhelming production."
2,"Unoriginal, cheap tricks. More like talent show.","Blast is a very well-coordinated show, as it is suposed to be. It employs a variety of different themes, instruments, and atmostphere, unlike, say, Stomp. But Blast does not feel like a theatrical piece. The majority of the show cold be played during a highschool football halftime or at an amusement park and could be well-recieved, but not in a theater. Where the producers do attempt to showcase some artistic originality, they fail quite miserably. Performers are enthusiastic, but they just don't deliver the absorbing, fascinating dynamics that, for example, Stomp does."
5,A Blast for any music lover...,"The above CD deserves a five star rating because of the exquisite musicianship that went into its production. Soundtrack to the Broadway show ""Blast!""- a more refined version of an onstage half-time field show - the music gives an auditory peek at the award winning show.The contributing musicians consist of elite marching and concert performers. Many of them are retired members of the Indiana Drum and Bugle Corp.Well known composers such as Chuck Mangione provide instrumental pieces of carious styles. Jazz, hip-hop, and Latin tracks provide something that appeals to everyone.The musicians give a flawless performance, putting emotion into every note. The copious supply of trumpet solos are particularly moving. Dynamics, accents, and style are accentuated to the point of perfection, complimented by first-rate sound editing. ""Blast!"" makes a wonderful addition to everyone's CD collection."
3,"Great music, BUT","The music contained in this CD attempts to present different aspects of Sudanese Music. The musicians do a great job and the singer has a nice, mellow voice. But, if you want true Sudanese pop you should try Abdel Gadir Salim, Abdel Aziz El Mubarak... Or if you want something more traditional check out Muhammed El Amin. Rasha's delivery lacks the drive and ability that the above singers posess. Unless you are a collector of Sudanese music, I recommend getting the other CD's before this one.Nevertheless, Some of the songs do sound great and show the potential of this young singer has yet to be reached."
4,A Daughter of Mother Africa,"This song grabbed me as if the spirit of Jimi Hendrix was there. Meaning: the words of this particular piece put me in a frame of mind that was clearly the mother of ""Axis Bold as Love"" a Jimi Hendrix album, who's words(on that particular song) have discriptions of life, people, and situations gathered in the midst of an hipnotic flow of music. AND WHEN LISTENING TO ""RASHA"" IF PART OF YOUR BODY IS NOT MOVING.......CALL THE PERAMEDICS!!!! Songs 3,8 & 10 are most enlightening. The cover of Jimi's ""AXIS BOLD AS LOVE"" album, reflects an ""East Indian"" influence. So has the artist from Sudan and her cd ""Sudaniyat"". If you have the time, sit and listen to this music and let yourself be taken by it's wonderful aroma and influence to the mind."
4,Funai FDRV90E,Funai FDRV90E Dual-Deck DVD/VHS Player/RecorderI purchased the dual-deck about a month ago for approx. $100.00. I wasn't sure if it would be a decent product for a price this cheap. It's used on an occassional to moderate basis. So far it seems good. The picture quality is good. Has one touch recording from VCR to DVD as well as DVD to VCR. I have not used the one touch recording yet.. only recorded from TV to DVD. The quality of recording in the 4 hour or two hour modes is good.. any modes more than 4 hours loses a lot of the quality. ONE THING TO BE CAREFUL OF IS THAT THIS MACHINE ONLY RECORDS ON DVD'S THAT ARE A MAXIMUM OF 8x.. so you may have to order these off the internet since the stores all carry 16x which will not work with this deck. If you buy the DVD-RW then I believe 8x can be found anywhere. Hookups were simple and helped eliminate the issues of having both a DVD and VCR. I hope it holds up since it seems to be a pretty decent deck for the money.
2,Be prepared to spend more money,"I have a very similar model with the Magnavox name but the warranty/maker is Funai. I LOVE recording with it - and I have put all home videos on DVD's and made copies of them for the kids . . .BUT the manual is complicated, the customer service (phone and email) is horrible and slow (30 minutes on hold - had called other times and had to hang up before call was answered) and after 4 months of use (1 month after 90 day warranty is up) it has to go to the shop! I feel a company that builds and sells equipment for this much money should back it up more than 90 days!"
2,waste of time and money,"I just finished reading this book and sadly I wasn't happy at all. The author tries to explain Control Theory techniques using the Z transform, but lacks good explanations on how he obtained the models and doesn't really get to any point with it. The topic I was more interested was in how to make an optimal controllers (software) in an embedded system, but it was only discussed in the last chapter and no depth or actually good advice in how to implement the software of all the things he explained in the rest of the chapters. Only discusses some filters, and the PID structure and in a very shallow way. I don't recommend this book."
3,False Advertising,"The advertised 1000WRMS (4ohm) power is actually a marketing gimmick.The amp is rated 1000WRMS @ 14.8VDC but only 300WRMS @12VDC (This is the value the rest of the mobile audio market uses). So, if you are buying this to power some 1000WRMS subs, you are only going to get about 300W of continuous power, wasting your money. If you don't believe me, look at the items manual(pdf).I have owned this amp for about 5 years and it rocks, put a custom plastic cover with fans on it to show off the insides, looks extremely sweet. This amp is HUGE and cranks a lot of heat if you are using lower impedance. However, if you are buying this amp for high power drivers, you will be sadly disappointed comparing it to other amps in the same class.Great value for the price hence the 3 stars; false advertising: -2 star."
2,From gem to junk,I got this amp in July 2011.. It hit so hard and deep my back never felt better..Running it to two Boss 2400w 12s it finally took a dump on March 5th 2012..I now have a Boss Onyx 2000 watt amp and the sound is nothing like this Lanzar Amp was but I am yet to play with all the sound knobs to find my true sound..I will repost after after experiencing this Boss Amp verses the Lanzar Amp..I'm clueless on car audio specs but sure there's a difference between 4000 watts and 2000 watts...
5,nice but not to powerful,Came like it said brand new in the box with fast delivery..I had this on two 12 type r's and they BANG:-)
2,fry like bacon,i had this amp hooked up to 2 12inch max pros and it sounds great for a month or so but i fried this amp twice so if ur looking for short term then go for it but otherwise dont waste your time
1,Dreadful recording,The singing is OK by a group of performers who are doing their best with a labored English translation. But the recording is from a live performance and it sounds like someone just put a mike down on the stage a pushed record. I threw this CD away.Jack H.Houston TX
3,Stuck hard together,It was hard clumped together and have to use a ice pick to try to break it apart and in the process it breaks up the balls of food.
4,"good price, excellent food","Had my African Grey on pellet food until the company had a major recall. Looked around for a pet food with a stellar safety reputation and found Lafeber. The food is undeniably more expensive then some other options, which is why I buy in 20lb bulk. Unfortunately a lot of the nutriberries harden together and you have to separate them by hand, or I would give this a perfect score. My bird loves them and they are nutritious enough for everyday feeding. Good product."
5,Awesome Bowie Pictoral Guide,"This book is great for fans of David Bowie. It's loaded with awesome color photos spanning his entire career, from Ziggy's flashy red hair up to the late '90s and his ultra-cool Union Jack overcoat. Bowie has always been one to set fashion trends, and ""Bowiestyle"" is a very entertaining and enlightening look at David over his exceptional career. The written passages aren't quite as impressive, but they do hold lots of neat trivia-type information and very nicely augment the high quality photography. (and hey.. if you want a Biography, there are several available) Overall loads of fun to leaf through, and a cool look back at the styles and trends that this artist so deftly influenced."
4,a fantastic pictorial...,"I had my doubts about the book based on the title ""bowie style"", but the ever in-the-know Joel Stones strongly recommended it to me, so i checked it out and couldn't put it down. Chock full of pictures from way back in the beginning--the usual childhood ones, but from the beginning of his career until the present, as well as pics of various influences on Bowie and people he has in turn influenced. Well worth it for the pics alone, with interesting information and stories scattered throughout. Extremely cool for Bowie fans, and very interesting for all music fans who enjoy tracing back the times and trends..."
4,But don't buy the Kindle version - terrible,"In certain books it wouldn't matter if the pictures were poor quality, but this is a book on Bowie's STYLE. The guy had it in spades. Better to buy a used paperback than the ebook; it's formatted so terribly that whole/half paragraphs are lost in page turns. Most of the pictures are no bigger than thumbnails, and such low-res that zooming them turns them to a blurry mess. Almost every book I've read on Kindle has formatting and editing issues. Normally they're just an annoyance,though,as your mind fills in the blanks or corrects syntax. etc. But this is really bad. Wow.I gave it four stars because the content is enjoyable enough and I don't want to slam the book just because the e-version is screwy."
2,nibblings from a pie too large,"Yes, good pictures. But most written parts are shallow snippets. That and it's too small a book for the TONS of BETTER photos out there that you happen upon when searching for such things on the internet(where can those be had in printed form?). This book should have had an ""easy-wide-open"" binding, 100 more pages, less flacid/obvious commentary, and NO thumb-sized cut-up pages being passed as flashy ""graphic design""(more like graphic resign...David?).If a book of the same size and length were comprised for only a couple of years per volume THEN this would be great. Bowie's amazing, but why this gaseous flounce?Good for 12-yr-old fans treading the foothills."
4,Solid sci-fi thrill ride,"I'm a sucker for all books about sexy artificial intelligences, so I loved this one from beginning to end. Writing was just a tad rushed at times, but the characterizations are solid, and never gets boring."
3,Interesting,"I've been a bolt member for a two years now. The best part of the website is the tagbook feature. It really is surprising how brilliant and creative normal,everyday people really are on the inside. This particular book expressed that and is a great piece of entertainment. It really is intersting to comb through the many different questions and answers that are written. Unfortunately,the writers missed out on some of the best questions out there.However,there is still a large amount of funny and compelling questions to more than make up for the cost of the book. I recoment buying it."
2,Somewhat boring....,"I just got the book today...I was expecting something a little better. There's nothing there that I can't get off the site...as a loyal ""Bolt-er"" for years now, this didn't do that much for me...I yawned after the first few pages.And it's the same, page after page after page."
1,A real disapointment,"This book has an awful design, it's all grey and white (to save money, I suppose). I wouldn't expect anything less from the ugliest site on the internet.It features trite and patronizing questions, like, ""What is your favorite word?"" and ""Who is the weirdest person you know?"". Features a lot of stupid questions each with three stupid answers.If you are looking for some of your favorite ""Bolt Stars"" you won't find them here, none of the names are recognizable. Overall rating: boring and ugly."
4,Walk in Their Shoes,"Mardi is quietly determined to do well in America, even though she is resentful about having to come. The arrival of a ""lost"" uncle and a boy he is taking care of sets off a string of events that break through the icy core of reserve she has been harboring since her arrival.This is another book that gives you a better understanding of another culture - or perhaps a deeper understanding of your own. The complex lives of people who have come to America and left their own country are sensitively portrayed here. The central story, although a bit predictable, is told so sympathetically that you can practically feel the individual and separate joys and pains of each person."
4,Quick Look Drug Book,"As a medical transcriptionist, there are many times when a doctor will say the name of a drug incorrectly or I cannot quite understand what the doctor is saying. In the Quick Look Drug Book, there is a section in the back of the book called the Indication/Therapeutic Category Index. In this section, you can look up the patient's diagnosis and it will list the medications used for that illness. Most of the time I am able to determine what drug the doctor is referring to by using this method. It has saved me a lot of time and effort over the years. I highly recommend this book if you are a medical transcriptionist."
3,Good for a beginner,"It appears that this multi-media device was worth buying when I did. The only problems with it is that1. It's homebrew compatibility isn't that good.2. The video will get out of sync or not have sound at all in bid filesBut other than that, it's decent. But not recommended."
1,DON'T BUY THIS.,"I'm going to name drop here, Nintendo DS R4 Revolution!!!A long, long...long time ago I bought this (before I heard about the R4), and it disappointed me so much I took it back the next day. For one, it's bulky. The DS lite is heavy enough. Second, the interface is awful, and it's not user friendly. Say you wanted to add an avi file, but there's no converter tool to make it smaller. The playback to the video is jerky and off beat. The only good thing about this is the four gigs. I do have to give it to them for that. The four gigs can't amount to anything if it's slow as Christmas, though. I'm done ranting, just don't buy this. You'll thank me and everyone else who rated later. I got one word for you - ""R4"""
1,Trouble with MAX,"When I opened this today I put games in it and booted up Moonshell. When I tapped on a game I get an error saying ""not support adapter?"" I have no clue what this means only that I can play my games now. Thanks Datel,thanks."
2,Not simple to use,The product required several download updates to get the promised functions and I still cannot play many homebrew games from the storage card. price was fair and after updates to moonshell and finding the video converter I now enjoy videos music and picture viewing also the memory is upgradeable with a compact flash
2,Eh...,I bought it a long time ago.. but here is some advice take out the HDD and replace it with a Compact Flash. when you do that.. install moonshell.. and you will have an ok experience.
2,A 4GB Disaster,"For moths now I've been searching for a Personal Digital Multimedia Player. I couldn't make up my mind about purchasing a regular PMP device or this MAX Media 4GB PMP. Let me tell you, this is NOT worth the $130 nor the $50 and I wouldn't give more than $30 if you still plan on getting one. Luckily while browsing other online stores I found a really nice, rather tiny, slim and sexy PMP for the Nintendo DS lite! and it goes for about $50. Do yourself a favor, and if you're a BIG Nintendo DS fan just like me, don't waste more than what's needed on this bad piece of software. It's still a good option if you have extended knowledge on homebrewed software and media formating and have an extra media flash drive to spare. Theres better options out there!"
4,More Bruce Lee,Good insight into Lee's thoughts and theories. It is easy to see his Ving Tsun kung fu roots and basis of JKD
2,WHAT SKILLS ?!?,"SKILL IN TECHNIQUES ? What skills even if you have read the other books before this one you'll see that there's no technique to be ""more"" skilled!"
1,Fun Factor?,"I'd hardly call this game fun...trying is more like it. It looks like it was designed for the Nintendo (not the 64, just the Nintendo), the game play is dismal. It lacks the charm of Tetris or the challenge of Klax. This is just a bad game from design to execution. Maybe for 12 and younger, but if you can drive...you probably won't enjoy this game. I bought the game because of the reviews it recieved here and all I can say is...Warning! Stay away!"
5,Creative fun and a lot of strategy,"As with the other reviews i have only got experience with the n64 version of the game and if nothing has changed although im sure there are lil changes here and there, it is a very fun addictive game that is fun alone or multi-player.. Your job is to build walls and mountains around an area so that when rain hits the area it will not overflow and flood. Sounds simple and boring huh? In reality though the fun factor is amazing and the game gets difficult and fast paced very quickly. Other elements are included such as bombs (that blow away your ""mountains"" and make holes for the water to flood into) that really make this game challenging and anything but boring. The only real way to know what this game is about is to give it a try, but beware you will be hooked instantly =) ."
2,"Different, But The Novely Wears Off Quick...","With so much content being put into games these days, it's going to take more than a tetris-like game to give a game player true value. The game is different, and challenging. However, the novelty wears off after a little while and you're left with a so-so game that begins to gather dust."
2,All concerns...no positives about being preg over 35,"After having three kids in my mid/late 20s, my husband and I decided to have another at age 39. I thought it would be great to find a book that talked about the differences.What I found in reading this book is that it has no more info than any regular preg book-- less actually and the most frustrating part is that it only really addresses the negatives and ""issues"" you might have to deal with being over 35. There is not one word about the positives about having a baby when you are over 35.I was so disappointed in this book. :("
1,disappointing,"to encourage single parent is sinful, the child not having a father is against nature, dont wasre your money on this one"
3,For Shemp Fans and Stooge Completists Only,"In spite of the appearance of Curly on the cover of the box and menu, Curly is nowhere to be seen on this set. Instead, you get the following items, in quality ranging from mediocre to poor, with the most awkward menu design ever.Malice In The Palace (1949) and Sing A Song Of Six Pants (1947) - two public domain Three Stooges shorts with Shemp that appear on every cheap Stooges DVD available, here with poor reproduction.Four Shemp Vitaphone shorts. An earlier reviewer wrote that this set included ""Dizzy And Daffy"" and ""Here Comes Flossie,"" but I could not find them on this disk. As of this writing, both are posted to YouTube.Instead, I see the following Shemp Vitaphone comedies.His First Flame (1935)Why Pay Rent? (1935)I Scream (1934)Serves You Right (1935)Last and least, six New Three Stooges cartoons from 1965.Little Old BombmakerDentist The MenaceHold That LineThe Tree NutsTin Horn DudeThimk or Thwim"
2,not too pleased,I was disappointed in the quality of this telephone address book..not as expected...very flimsy outer cover.
3,Not the 1963 version,"I have to say the Product Title ""Astro Boy, Vol. 1 (1963)"" is misleading.This DVD is Episodes 1-10 of ""the all-new ASTRO BOY, a modern update ...""This is evidently the 2004 version.I'm not interested in that; didn't watch it.I don't like putting a rating on something I haven't seen,but I also would like other customers to know what they are getting so I have to choose some rating.I picked a neutral 3 stars."
3,mixed feelings,"I have mixed feelings about this set. I was generally happy with most of the first year cards and would recommend them for anyone who is looking to get a handle on how black letter law works in practice. While I found the trust and wills card helpful, the intestacy cards are few and their application of UPC per-capita relies on some older version of UPC without saying so. I don't really understand how that happened. Their whole handling of per stirpes and per capita sounds as if one actually could choose one over the other - I was disappointed."
1,These don't fit 2002 Wrangler SE with half doors either :(,"I purchased these for my daughter's 2002 Wrangler, the fit guide said it would fit this vehicle but the back window is too small, one of the side windows has a zipper attached that it should not have because the zippers are built into the top, the other did not have a zipper but still did not fit properly.I am unclear why one would have a zipper and one would not even if it was for a different top. I read the other review that said these did not fit but thought I would be fine because her Jeep has the half doors and it is a 2002 not 2003. These will apparently not fit an original top or they are mislabeled as being for this year Jeep."
4,a good resource,"While I did not appreciate that the entire second half of this book included Farber's ""Curb Painting"" book, provided as an example, I did find a LOT of usable suggestions, links and many of my own questions answered. Yes, I could have tracked all of the information down on the Web through trial and error, eventually, however, this book saved me lots of time and effort by doing that for me. Farber's writing style is not as polished as is my preference, but I stuck with the book for its content. I was not diappointed."
4,Easy to use and great for a small,"I always wanted to have my own workout in my apartment. Since space if very limited in apartments, this has worked out great! It has 4 different positions so that you can workout as if you are acutally in gym all while watching your favorite tv shows or with a friend on speaker phone. Combine it with the 5-in 1 weight set and it will make the perfect minigym for any small space. I gave it 4 instead of 5 starts because my bed sits really low and I had some trouble finding a place to store it in. Closet works fine!"
5,Dan,"Great product. Perfect for my workouts. No assembly. Folds open and close, so you can store in closet or under bed when not in use. Very sturdy.Impressed with the quick delivery."
5,Perfect!,It says on the box..Designed and Engineered for women. It also works for guys. This bench is perfect. I don't have a lot of space so the fold up feature is great. Works and built just as well as the non fold up $200 bench. The best thing about this bench is that it comes fully asembled! It is built very nice. For $79 plus free shipping you can't beat this. It really is a great deal. Very happy with purchase.
4,Great Adjustable Weight Bench,I purchased this bench for my wife. The size and fit is perfect for her small frame. I have used this bench without any problems. Nice solid construction at a good price.
5,Great outdoor thermometer,"This is a great outdoor thermometer for daytime use. It is transparent except for the numbers and is very accurate when compared to other electronic thermometers that I have. Its negatives are that it must be placed on a window that the sun doesn't hit and when it's dark outside , its invisible. The price is very low, but the shipping from Northern Tool and Equipment was more than the price of the thermometer."
2,Not so good; not so bad,"I bought three of these. One fastened to a sheltered window works find. Two fastened to windows which get more exposure to wind and weather keep falling off--and, when they do, parts of the numbers pull off the dial and stick to the glass. Two out of three: not a great investment."
5,"Great, simple, inexpensive thermometer","The product arrived sooner than I'd expected. It was very easy to install. To gauge its accuracy, I also placed a liquid column thermometer (didn't install - just placed) nearby. The Electrostatic Cling Outdoor Window Thermometer is very accurate and easy to view. This is one case where the least expensive also was the most useful and best performing. Would purchase again and definitely recommend to a friend."
3,"Some Work, Some Don't","I purchased 4 of these. Opened inside the house for several days, it was clear that 2 worked reasonably ok and 2 were hopelessly off. One working thermometer was placed as directed (not in direct sunlight) on a window to the front porch, and one was placed on the back porch window, directly opposite . Right now there is a twelve degree difference between the two!! So, while the idea of these thermometers is great, I'm not sure how helpful they are. They do stick to the windows quite well, and I like that they are very easy to read. Now, if they were only more accurate...I would have returned them, but the shipping cost quite a bit in relation to the product cost."
5,So easy to use!,basically you just open the package and place on the window. Excellent for the price!
3,VERY PLEASED,"Very good product, am well pleased with it. It works like it is supposed to. I put it on the outside of my storm door, it clings very well, and is easy to read when I open my inside door. Very good service, delivered in a reasonable amount of time.I'd recommend this company to anyone."
2,It lasted 3 years but it looked ugly,"It seemed to work okay as a thermometer, but it was fiddly and didn't stick evenly to the window, so I had to reposition it too many times, and having a screen on the second-story window made that difficult. In the end it discolored, and washing it with Simple Green killed the plastic. I wouldn't buy another one in this format, especially now that remote sensors work wirelessly."
1,Misses the mark,"Easy to apply to window and easily visible; however, like other similar thermometers attached to a outside window, it consistently reads 8-10 degrees TOO warm, as it is probably reading temperature transmitted from warmer inside. So, if you want ACCURATE readings, find another product."
2,This product did not meet my expectations.,"The paint pens don't work well. It is difficult to get the pens started if you are a toddler or an adult, and some of the pens don't work at all. The paint barely come out. I would not recommend this product."
2,A shadow of its former self,"You know, it's a shame really. Schrade made what was in my opinion one of the best multi-tools for the money. Sure you could buy better but you'd end up spending a lot more. This latest tool from Schrade (It's the same tool really, just manufactured differently in a different place) is a cheap imitation of the original. The metal feel cheap and the jaws are no longer laminated, riveted steel. It's merely cast in one piece out of a cheaper metal. The blades too are not what they were. Too bad too because I was hoping to replace my 18 year old tool with a new one. I will but it won't be with this ""new"" Schrade."
3,Very Versital Item--One Flaw,"I have one of this product in each of my four cars, motorcycle and with my Carhart work pants and chore coat. Its only flaw is that the tabs that restrain the tools from opening beyond their intended limit are not strong enough if too much hypertension is applied in use. The tabs cannot be bent back into place."
2,No perfect,"The deal was good, but they on not perfect. Would not order these again. They are the cheaper ones. Did not last. Broke easy."
4,Shrade Tough-Tool. Very good value,I have owned this multi-tool for about five years and its still in great shape. This is a VERY good tool for the money. I just recently purched another one as a gift for a friend.
3,Don't think you'll be getting a bargain Leatherman,"I bought this to abandon in Mexico. I check my bags going down and carry on coming home because of liquids that I have to pack down and connections to make returning. This is quite crude, but then again costs about a 5th of the cost of a comparable Leatherman. The handles seem lightly made. The third blade in on both handles hangs when you close it. But it is under $20.I've carried a Leatherman Wave for years. It is the best travel tool there is. This one, not so much. But, it will be useful I'm sure. I've bought and abandoned a number of multitools over the years because of carry on restrictions. This ranks right up with the no name ones you can get at the mini mart or bargain sporting goods stores. Maybe just a little better and about the same price."
4,amazon only when you care to send for the vary best,"hello to all amazoner's out there this the best, when you need it, its there and on time, i can tell you a true story about my order, i need it my multi tool, for camping and i was amazed with then 48 hour's i think that it was here 241/2houres man i can tell you its the best, and im waiting for my second order and i can rest at shoure that i know that it will be here on time, thanks amazon you know that you have to be the best, and please keep up the good work, and looking forward to doing bussiness in the near future,absalutly when you have to have it, go amazone, ""it the best""!!!!!!!"
4,Schrade Tough Tool,"I've owned one of these for years,showed it to a friend he was impressed. I bought him one. Would be good if all blades locked open,otherwise a good tool..."
1,Pay Attention,Pay more attention than I did. This game is designed to run on WINDOWS95. Do not buy it if you are running WindowsXP. I'm going to try to send it back.
5,Great,"These movies are awesome! My son loves these and he doesn't get to watch tv but I don't feel so guilty letting him watch these over and over, great learning and great lessons."
4,Little People Friendship Collection,This was the perfect gift for our children. We were happy with the Amazon.com service.
4,Aceptable,"Es para niños menores de 2 años, el mio le gusta pero no se queda mucho rato seguido viendolo."
1,just terrible,"Honestly, I cannot believe the positive reviews this product has received here! I find I can usually rely on amazon reviews for good information, but this is a truly awful DVD. It's full of superficial, meaningless stories and silly clay dolls with beady little black eyes and no human expression whatsoever.There are SO many more worthwhile shows for this age group out there: Little Einsteins, classic Sesame Street (Cookie Monster's Best Bites, for example), The Wiggles...the list goes on and on. Keep looking!"
4,My kids love Little People,I have a 4 1/2 and 2 1/2 that love the little people videos! They are glued to the screen for any of them - Teach great morals!
3,Home Sweet Home,"Fairly generic in its approach, probably because it was done for television, this ghost story is held aloft by the actors who made the characters people we can feel something for. I especially liked young Molly (Peyton R. List) and the always fabulous Marianne Jean-Baptiste. The story is hardly challenging and the ghost is more pitiful than predatory. Much of the story's bite involves ""suggestion"" rather than overt horror. This is a lot like the timid horror movies they used to produce in the 60s. This is not the stuff of nightmares. It does make you wonder though about the next house you might buy.Enjoyable for its type."
4,Lots of Twists,Pretty decent ghost-thriller about a haunted house in the Detroit suburbs. Lots of twists kept itinteresting. Could have been more a little more intense but at least my family didn't run out of theroom as we watched. Jeri Ryan and Marianne Jean Baptiste did a great job.Found this trailer online:[...]
2,my checkbook is scarier,Scenery was beautiful; the house was beautiful; acting was good. Plot - predictable. Not a thriller. Not scary at all. Watching Kim Kardashian on tv - now thats scary!
4,Great for OT!,"I bought this for my son with Aspergers. He can read and he can write, but he has a problem getting the words from his mind onto paper. He took to this instantly. An added bonus, being able to see his words, he's correcting his own speech! The only problem I have is that it's missing simple words like ""did"". I was happy to see that it came with ""n't"" and ""es"", so you could add onto words. But my son is so funny about things, he refuses just to place a homemade word sign into the sentence. Instead, he will totally change his sentence. That is the ONLY problem I've had with the set. However, I have to give the company credit. They probably never figured on their product being used in this way. IT IS AN AMAZING TOOL FOR MY SON!!! And for that, I am completely satisfied. Now if they will create an 'additional words' kit, life would be perfect. ;o)"
4,I want other kits with this size of tiles,"Does anyone else know where I can get sets like this one? I like the size of the magnets, but I would like to get more sophisticated words for teens."
5,AWESOME,"Bought for my son so he could practice reading at breakfast and these are great, we use them all day!"
4,One man/many styles,"Ray Charles has positively influenced every style of American music he has dabbled in. This disc contains examples of his early R&B work, a great group of country tunes and a couple of Beatle songs. None of them are among the best known of Charles' work but are excellent examples of why Brother Ray is a national treasure."
3,They Blew It Again,"Volume 2 and STILL no ""America the Beautiful""?? Inexcusable!! Still several good songs."
3,Looking for an old tune of Ray Charles,"I had an old album of Ray Charles hits at one time and one (I think) was titled ""Game number nine"". I am now looking for that particular song on CD and am unable to locate it. Can anyone direct me to which album it was on and also is it available on CD? Really appreciate some response on this. Send to my email address: the_ottoman@mybluelight.comThanksSteve Otto"
2,TOO BASIC,"Of course, there are some interesting formulas you can actually use, but most of them are too basic. At the end of the book there are lots of pages with conversion tables. All the info in the book is in someway useful, but be aware that you may already know everything what's in this book."
5,A gold mine for smart racers!,"This book shows you how to use math to make your car perform better on a road course, the strip or the street. I learned how to see engines, torque curves, gearing etc. in an entirely different way. I can make changes with confidence that I am going in the right direction. If you can work a calculator, you can use this book!"
3,Basic formulas for novice enthusiasts,"This book is not for experts. It lack in-depth attitude. Rather, this book turned to be novice oriented. Formulas are basic and there are no graphs. I liked detailed conversion table to metric units."
2,"Really dated, but math is ,,,,,","Really dated, but math is ,,,,,math. The author suggests that a person using this build a DOS (huhhhh) program to run the various equations. If you just need a formula or a constant, math is......."
2,Outdatet.,"You don't need this book, unless you still are working on the good old ""commandore 64"".There's bound to be better books on the marked..."
3,missing formulas for induction,"its a good book, but the one i bought was missing formulas for induction by either carb, or fuel injection. i did by it used, but still i am missing an important section. check to make sure the book you buy has all sections. i did not and wound up with a book that was incomplete."
5,Just Fantastic,This is a great reference book for the automobile enthusiast and performance tuner. All of the calculations are grouped into logical sections and explained well. I only wish that it came with a CD or diskette with all of the equations in a spreadsheet format. This is a keeper.
2,A bit disapointed,"Pretty basic, was looking for more. These formula combo's are easily found on the net for free, if you do not have the net? you will not see this anyway. The book does have some value."
3,Quick Reference for automotive formulas,"One of the primary resources for creating my online gearcalculators. Besides the gear formulas I use, here are some others...* Determine Displacement/Bore and Stroke* Determine Compression Ratio* Determine Carburetor CFM requirements* Calculating Horsepower and Torque* Weight Displacement* Weight Transfer* Determine Center of Gravityand more...This book does not overwhelm you with complex formulas. It keeps them simple. This a must have for the do-it-yourselfer automotive shelf."
3,Too simplistic to be much use..it does cover the basics well,"I bought the book with the anticipation of a great source of mathimatical relationships between systems and to what degree each acted upon each other. While it is a good book for beginning theory and simple math, it leaves too much out to be much good."
4,Great book to getting started!,"I've been working out for several years but wanted an extra boosy before my wedding. I think the book has great chapters on food, health and training in general, although I agree with fellow readers about the recommendations for vitamins. Unless you have any medical conditions, a multipurpose vitamin a day is fine.As for the workout, I love the program! It's a great boost and really get me to the gym and doing my workout in a good pace. As for the diet, it's not called the bridal bootcamp for nothing! Follow the plan and I promise you will see result :)"
3,Average,Bought this before my wedding. I'm already an advanced exerciser so I did not find a lot of great information in this book but still an interesting read.
2,Not big enough,"This cage is not an ideal cage for rats because it is not large enough. Rats need as much space as you can possibly give them, as they are smart and curious creatures who enjoy playing with toys and each other.I bought this cage for one of my female rats when I was introducing her to my other rats, and for this I think the cage is allright, but it is DEFINITELY too small for more than one rat. My rat Julia barely had any room with her wheel, igloo, and toys.This is an easy cage to clean, so it gets points for that, but I would NOT use it as your rat's main habitat."
1,Too Small To House Rats.,"The dimensions of this cage are too small to house rats adequately, even with the second level, and this cage should not be advertised as a rat cage. It is recommended to allow rats 2 cubic feet of space each, and a minimum of 1.5. This cage barely reaches 2.5, and cannot house more than one rat. Rats must be kept with one or more same-sex companions, and so this cage would only be appropriate for quarantining a new rat before it's put in with a cagemate."
4,Great for rats,"This is pretty easy to put together. My rats love it. Works very well for two small rats, giant rats or males may be crowded. I have an albino and a hooded rat and they are very comfortable with it. The bars are not too far apart at all. The issue I had is that you have to bend one of the bars (pull it down) to get the latch over it so it stays closed."
3,a good cage but too small,"Excellent rat cage that's very durable and fun for my girls to play in. They love the little hanging bell toy that comes with the cage. I stuff veggies and treats into it and they have a ball trying to get the food out. However, it's way, way too small for more than one rat. There's definitely not enough room for both of my rats and one is a tiny baby girl. I plan on getting the Exotic pet cage by the same brand. It's way bigger and I can fill it with enough toys to keep my ratlets occupied."
1,Too small for any animals,"The minimum cage size for a hamster is 360 square inches. The minimum cage size for 2 rats (and it should be at least a pair together), is also 360 square inches. These are the minimums. This cage is smaller than that. It's ok for temporary housing, like quarantine, but I don't find them very safe nor easy to clean. The balcony holds urine. There just isn't enough room. I ended up going to another cage manufacturer and had a custom cage made."
1,not appropriate for rats,"This cage and starter kit was recommended by the pet store when my son purchased his rats. It seemed a nice size for the two female fancy rats that he was purchasing... lightweight, and easy to clean. However, they promptly chewed a hole through the bottom and escaped! I would HIGHLY suggest you invest a few more dollars and get an all metal cage. Very disappointed."
3,Good transportation cage.,"Rats do best in groups of two or more even if there small this cage is NOT big enough for them.I did have one good sized male in this cage he got moved to a Super Pet My First Home Multi-Floor, Large then one small female rat in this cage and moved her to the Super Pet My First Home for Critters, Teal it fits into a smaller space but it is bigger for her she loves running up and down the shelves just remove the way to large wheel and put in a smaller one or none at all.Now in this cage I have my hamster and I would like to buy another for my mouse it will give him more room and the 1/2 inch bar spaceing is small enough they wont escape. I also like critter trail cages for mice.I do want to add I have one of these I use to transport my rats to the vet. When my female had to have surgery at the vet they kept this cage there and put her in it after surgery then I put the small cage in the car and didn't disturb her."
4,Works great in a small space,"This cage ""works"" for one or two rats which will be allowed ample time to run around outside of the cage everyday. It is definitely easy to clean (the top pops right off), but needs to be cleaned frequently because it is so small. The toy that it comes with is absolute junk (I'm sorry, but it merely takes up space and is not very interesting for a rattie). Additionally, the cage folds up into a large luggage bag making it easy to pack your cage if necessary. I have had mine for 2 years now and it has stood up nicely.Overall, a great cage especially for the price. However, in this case bigger would be better."
3,Pretty good... kind of small,"Good cage for one maybe two young rats but it is really small and rats like a lot of room, I would suggest getting a bigger cage. Over all it held together great and was made well the size was really the only thing I had an issue with."
2,Is This a Joke?,Two problems.1 - It came bent to hell. The door is so bent my rat can get out of it2 - The platform is a completely different color. The bottom is purple but the platform is blue. Seriously>1 star for actually having all the pieces and a 2nd for it being the correct size other then that I'm extremely pissed off -_-
4,Corners need to be closer together,"This is a good cage for my Syrian Hamster and he loves it. The only issue I have with this cage is the corners where the bars meet. I had to use twist ties to get them closer together so my hamster would not escape. Although he probably could not, it would be nice if they were closer together for safe measures."
4,Large Hamster Home,"This house for pet rats turned out to be the perfect first home for our daughter's large hamster. It's wonderfully large enough that the hamster is happy and has plenty of room to fit the wheel, food, water, chew sticks, cardboard tubes and even a never-used hammock that my husband bought. It is easy to take apart and clean on a weekly basis. I would have given it 5 stars except it was disappointing when my daughter opened it to get it ready before we went to pick out her hamster and the ramp was missing. I called and left a message with the sender and they got back to me after the holiday. Unfortunately, I lost that info after visiting relatives. Fortunately, the hamster is large enough that he doesn't need a ramp to get up on the shelf. Overall, this is a wonderful home for the hamster!"
4,Nice for 1 male or 2 female rats,"This cage is relatively easy to put together as well as to clean weekly. I just separate the two pieces, dump out the bedding into a plastic grocery bag, and wash both pieces in the bath tub/shower. And this cage works perfectly to hang the large critter space pod from the top of the cage. My boy absolutely loves to chill in there while I'm at work or when I don't have him out to play."
5,"sensitive, intelligent book","Telotte's book remains the best book on Lewton in terms of a sensitive, intelligent ""reading"" of these remarkable films. While Telotte is light on the ""techno"" aspects, he orchestrates an impressive review of these films, generating a compelling and convincing approach to their mythic qualities."
4,A True Hoosier Hero,"This is a must read for every Hoosier, Most physicans would also enjoy reading about this country doctor who did things the rest of us could only dream of doing. The book is warm hearted, entertaining, and well written. After reading the book, I felt as if I had sat by a fireplace sharing a very pleasant conversation with Doc Bowen. He is one of the few politicians I ever heard of who never was involved in any scandal, remained true to his principles, and remained loved by the folks of his constituency. As a fellow family doctor, I felt proud to have someone of my own profession rise to governor and later cabinet secretary on the administration of President Reagan."
4,good book in proper context,"Fascinating read, yet must be read with the realization that this is a picture of a culture under intense (mostly wartime) stress and flux. The account happens at a time of major population incursions of whites into native lands and a time when native groups are being pushed into each other's subsistence territories by such incursions. It also occurs at a time when a number of destabilizing introductions (such as horses and guns) have recently come into native communities. Keep in mind that this picture of Apache & Comanche culture is about as reflective in the broader, overall sense as an German soldier's account of his life from 1916-1946 would be of overall German culture down through the ages. Read in proper historical context, this book is excellent. Read as a sweeping generalization of Apache life, it is bound to give a skewed impression."
4,"Interesting, eye-opening account of history.","I really enjoyed this account of what it was like to live among Indians in those days. Graphic, no nonsense account of how it was--a nice peek into real history of the time. I was amazed at the life this man lived during his capture and after his return to his home."
4,The real old West!,I really enjoyed this book as I have a great interest in Native Americans. This book answered many questions I had about what life would have been like in this time period. Very eye opening and recommended.
5,Best description of Native American life i have found,"THis has got to be the best description of Native American life that i have ever found as told by the person that lived it. If you are interested in what life was really like, get this book."
3,Not Inspired Like Classic Bob James,Anyone admiring Bob James' classic recordings or works with Fourplay or collaborations should avoid this and hope he gets back on track soon.
3,Less than Amazing,"I was expecting a durable well-crafted flashlight since this cost around $25 + shipping, but I was very disappointed. The flashlight is made out of what seems to be flimsy plastic, the crank itself seems light, and no 2 functions can be on at once without draining all of the power. Looks like it will easily break if dropped. So much for an emergency flashlight, the low beam doesn't work either!"
3,wtf? this is good?,waaaaaay better then anything else this band has done. far harsher with more grind influence then later material.
5,One of the best books I've ever read!,"My best friend and I, who live in separate states and are in touch mostly by email, read this book at the same time. We marvelled at the intelligence of the writing, and the geniune friendship between J.D. and Pi. Many of the late night questions we ponder were addressed in M. Touch. We both felt compelled to write the author a letter of thanks for such a touching (no pun) book. But we never got around to it. Hopefully, Sylvia Brownrigg will read this review! I can't wait for her next book!!!"
1,Skip it,I bought this novel when it came out in London about a month ago and I found it really tedious. The author takes a pretty hackneyed idea (two people meeting over the internet) and goes nowhere with it. I hate to be negative but it reads like a novel that the author wrote her junior year at college and then managed to get someone to publish it.
1,Appallingly boring introspection which is damaging to the se,"There is little metaphysics of any significance in this book. I expected otherwise. The plot line is so thin and the illogical musings of the characters so nonproductive and destructive to themselves that I wonder truly why an editor accepted this manuscript. The inner world IS full of wonders, but on the other hand such extreme concern with the self beyond anything else, is destructive. Naval gazing has its place, I suppose, but please join a monastary."
3,Good things but persistant in one irrelevant element,I like this book and the ideas It's so intellegently written. I thoroughly enjoyed the online discussion. I loved the philosophical themes running through it. If they had omitted every reference to lesbianism that it contained it would have been even better. At first it didn't bother me it was lightly touched on then 3/4ths of everyone introduced were lesbians then the mother of Martha decides divorce makes her want to have lesbian tendencies too. I tolerated this stuff but It was completely irrelevant to anything but the author bringing across that she new the subject of lesbianism.
3,The Metaphysical Touch,"I found this book interesting to start with, but when it began to consist of nothing but transcripts of the sophomoric philosophizing by email between the two main characters, I simply couldn't keep going. Pity, as it is well written, as other reviewers have agreed."
2,Dull,"Well-intentioned, but overwritten (and not terribly well-written) account that cuts back and forth between two self-absorbed, unlikable characters. Sorry, but I don't think I will be able to get through this."
4,"Well written, informative and potentially life-saving. A+","Excellent book. Ms. Dukakis was very brave to share her story. I related to so much of her story. Unfortunately for me, electroconvulsive therapy did not work for me.What finally did work? An out-patient procedure called vagus nerve stimulation. It saved my life. I would recommend a great book about this new FDA approved therapy ""Out of the Black Hole: The Patient's Guide to Vagus Nerve Stimulation and Depression."" Depression is truely a ""black hole"" and thankfully I have been out of the ""black hole"" for over a year."
3,ECT and my fears.,"My psychiatrist has suggested ECT for me and recomended this book to me. It is an interesting book, but did not do much to calm my fears. I would still recomend the book, especially to family members of anyone considering ECT, it might help them better understand what happens."
3,Shock Therapy,"This book was not what I expected, though through no fault of AMAZON or the publisher. It was purely my own misunderstanding. I thought it was going to be a woo woo metaphysical approach to healing. It turned out to be a very scientific approach to healing using a technique that has been maligned in the past. I found it to be very interesting, even though it was not what I envisioned."
4,The New ECT,"I found this book to be very informative, but I wish that Kitty Dukakis would have given more on her personal experiences with the actual treatment."
1,Electroshock Therapy Kit for Home,"This 'self-electroshock' therapy unit is designed for home use, only needs two AAA batteries and a certificate from the state board of health. If you think a doctor of psychiatry is expensive and you get one who usually is neurotic, and sitting on an Italian leather sofa is both boring and deranged then this will be very good for you as you can not only administer shocks to your own frigid body when you want but you can avoid seeing a nut case shrink altogether. Only for mildly depressed people and individuals who think they see green ghosts walking along old gray carpets."
2,prospering marriage? failure to understand?,"A narrow view of how a marriage should be, with not much given to understanding our culture"
5,The BEST book on the subject.,"I have read other books like this before, but none hold a candle to Wilson in this regard. Fidelity is a must read for every Christian man, married or not. Wilson is blunt, biblical and pastoral in how he treats topics such as fornication, masturbation, rape, adultery etc. He provides a balanced perspective that doesn't pull punches - he truly calls a spade a spade.His use of contemporary jargon and slang to heighten the sense of obscenity in ungodly actions is excellent - and makes for a memorable and entertaining read.Wilson uses solid exegesis that doesn't bend or twist the text. He hits the nail on the head every time.Please buy this book and when you're done reading it, pass it around."
5,Amateur's opinion,"I'm fairly new to this world of early music, and, coming from a repressive Catholic background, it's taken me years to hear the beauty of this sacred music, and not hear ""Mass music"". This disc arrested me-the arrangement of the singers, clean and single voices for each part, with the counter tenors and sopranos almost indistinguishable at times, left me untired, unlike other composers wth whom you feel ""full"" after 15 minutes. I'm not a singer, but I'm dating a soprano who is teaching my ears. She didn't need to teach me that this is an excellent disc. I wish I could give a more technical review, instead of a gushing literary one, but my slow ears loved it. A good intro to Lassus."
5,Amazing,"Simply one of the most amazing photographic works I'v ever seen. I really recommend it for all photography lovers. Awesome, awesome!"
4,Very solid album,I was an early Kansas fan who lost interest in the band in the middle Eighties. I looked at the fellow members reveiws and decided to take a chance as I have a hard time with the 90's and current music scene (aagh). This is a very solid prog/pop album with a majority of the songs being very well (Ghosts is hauntingly beautiful) written. Most of the songs musically flow along with the lyrics. It does however sound alittle awky on a few songs. I am very pleased with my purchase and would recommend this album to any prog/rock fan especially at this price.
5,Bold Kansas,"I am a huge Kansas fan from the 70s. I have liked them since 1976. This cd is remarkable for a number of reasons. They attempted to do something completely different- a concept album. The concept is interesting and touching. Walsh has some great vocal moments. Ezrin seems to get the best out of the band. Highlights include Ghosts, Stand Beside Me, House on Fire, I Counted On Love, Rainmaker and the beautiful and inspiring Bells of St.James. Who said there wasn't anything progressive and interesting coming out in the late 80s? I know it was a hairy time but Kansas was still putting out quality stuff- too bad they're putting out only compilations now."
4,Why is everyone bashing this CD?!,"I've owned this cd for 11 years and it's always been one of my favorites. I'm not familiar with their 70s stuff other than what's on their greatest hits but I think ITSOT is a very good CD. True, not every song is good but that's true with EVERY CD by ANY artist? ain't it? I think ""Rainmaker"", ""Ghost"", ""I Counted On Love"", and ""Stand Beside Me"" should be considered their best songs. As far as bad CDs go, I would say ""Freaks of Nature"" their 1995 and most recent studio effort, is pretty crummy except for maybe 2-3 songs. ""Power"" is also a so-so CD with a few decent songs like ""All I Wanted"" and ""Taking In The View"" ITSOT is their best CD as far as the 4 Kansas CDs I own. ..and I can do without the violin player cos he tends to get carried away sometimes!"
5,A MUST FOR CHRISTIAN MUSIC FANS,"This cd should be on any Christian music must have list. Kip wrote his own songs and music. It's just him and his guitar. This is his first cd out and last. Kip was tragically killed this past summer in a skiing accident. The world has lost a great musician and a good person. I hope that you will be blessed by his songs. My favorite is the last song, ""Teach Me the Way of the Spirit."" He also released a tape back in the 80's, but I don't think it's going to make it to cd. A shame too, it had some great songs on it. This song was on that tape.God bless. From a Kip White fan in Amarillo, Texas."
5,michael b from nyc,I am a huge h-town from the begining but even if i wasn't i would still give it a five stars because of dino shazam and gi vocal ablity with keeps this cd banging with hits ....dino conner will surely be missed god bless in heaven
5,R & B At it's Best,"As I am the first person to have heard this album other than the artists and families, I have to tell you that this album is nothing less than brilliant. Although I'm not an R&B Fan this album has hooked me. Day I Die is phenomenal and will bring tears to your eyes, She Actin' Bad is a dance / club song that has you grindin'. Don't hesitate in getting this album, Knockin' Da Boots shot these guys to stardom, Imitations of Life will put them into the history books."
3,Nice ship..not so nice containers.,"The hull and body of this ship is ok. My hull was warped and had a hard time gluing it to the deck because it kept popping out from it being bent. The containers are crap, not very detailed and hard to put together. Overall, I only displayed the body of the ship without the containers."
4,I'M DIGGIN IT,"YO WAZ UP I'M DIGGIN THESE CATS FROM MEMPHIS IT'S NOT YOUR REGULAR 36MAFIA SOUND BUT IT'S ON A DIFFERENT LEVEL SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE NOT JUST HARDCORE RAP FANS.IT HAS THAT SOUTHERN BUMPING SOUND THAT THE WORLD CAN DIG ANY RACE CREED OR COLOR. I THINK THIS CD IS GOING TO BE HOT WHEN PEOPLE GET TO HEAR SOME CUTS.ONCE I HEARD SOME SAMPLES AT THEORCHARD.COM IT WAS A MUST HAVE FOR ME.Z-22 KEEP MAKING SOUNDS THAT THE WORLD CAN DIG NOW WHOGOT'EM.IF U WANT TO SUPPORT SOMETHING REAL THIS IS IT JAMES FROM DALLAS,TX."
3,Cures:A Gay Man's Odyssey.,"A bit dated. Gives a a good understanding of the history and challenges of those who suffer, as a result of social attitudes to a persons sexual orientation. However this book is limited to the male gender."
4,visine allergy drops work for me. thumbs up!,"This really worked for me.For about five days I have been using chlorsig for suspected infective conjunctivits, and swollen itchy red eyes and lids.The addition of zyrtec tablets has done little. Ordinary visine clear-eyes has provided a little extra relief.Half an hour ago I decided to try the Visine Allergy drops. Wow - fast action. The sand under my eyelids has almost gone and while I am still a bit itchy around the face, I am feeling a while lot better.I would recommend trying this product if you have been struggling with itchy eyes."
5,Good amazon buy,This is the only visine that actually takes the red out. I swear some of the other versions make my eyes worse.
4,Perfect Tool for House Wiring,One tool that quickly & easily strips the sheath off 12 or 14 gauge Romex and then the insulation off individual wires. The voltage sensor adds the safety factor of checking to be sure the power is off.
5,Nice book for any golfer's collection,"Kalb's books rank the greatest athletes in their sport, and this time he tackles golf. The Nicklaus chapter is priceless, and while I'm still not sure if he should be ranked ahead of Ben Hogan and behind Tiger, I enjoy Kalb's viewpoint. It's hard not to enjoy a book that stirs debates like this one does. You can't believe the pictures that are included in the center of the book. Some are stirring, some are humorous. This book has everyone it should...including great old golfers like Middlecoff, Demaret, and the like. Sam Snead fourth all-time? Ahead of Bobby Jones and Arnold Palmer?"
2,Inaccurate,"These test strips are really convenient and fast. They also appear to be seriously inaccurate. First of all, for nitrate and nitrate I could never get the strip colors to match any of the colors on the standard. Second, for ammonia it always showed clear, which means fine, but which made me suspicious because the tank I'm testing is just a week old, and there SHOULD be some ammonia. After some advice from other fishkeepers I bought the more expensive (and slower and more tedious) API test kit. Sure enough, that not only clearly shows nitrate and nitrite (in expected quantities), but also shows a LOT of ammonia. The API test kit is more expensive initially, and definitely not as convenient to use as the strips, but I'll trade a little convenience for accuracy any day."
1,photo insert card,"First of all,I thought I was ordering ""photo insert cards"" not ""photo insert card."" So, I paid $4.00 in shipping for one card. Also, I won't even use it because the quality is totally awful-- I order from amazon and it's affiliates all the time and I feel totally ripped off! I have a box of beautiful photo insert cards that I bought somewhere else-- and the quality is beautiful!Terri Kasper"
4,Look nice and do the trick,Great paper quality. Fit 4x6 pictures perfectly. They are making nice Thank You cards for our wedding.
3,Basic Plan,"This book is exactly what I expected. It is totally 80's, but solid on information. It is written for normal people, not medical personnel, physical trainers, pro-athletes.... I am sure science has come along way in this area since this book was published, but for basic training plans for a regular Joe, this is great."
4,Elegent White Rose,"I purchased the matching earrings a couple of years ago, and was happy to see the matching pendant. I receive many compliments wheneverI wear them."
3,Informational,I was disappointed that the institution took off the covers of the hardback book. I did not know that it was policy. My son was as shocked when he got it.
3,Rough Start,"Unfortunately, I was unable to get through this book. It seemed to offer practical advice, but was too heady to absorb. I found that Sisters of the Yam and Willow Weep for Me were better reads. Perhaps I will pick it up and try to get through it again one day, but not any time soon."
3,the stick is annoying,"the noise cancelling stick is in the middle of the cord, so it always falls of the desk, yanking my ears and making me angry. It's reason enough to look elsewhere."
5,Unbelievable,"Bought this for a trip to Europe, as the sound of the jet engines is very distressing. Cannot believe what a difference they make. My only complaint is that the design could be better in that they could fold down to a smaller design as I have seen other noise cancelling headphones do."
4,can't beat for the money,I travel quite a bit and I enjoy listening to my Ipod. With these earphones I can finaly hear the music without the backround noise. Great DEAL
3,Alright for the money,I am going my 2nd pair of NC that are non-Bose.I think 3rd time is a charm and I am going to finally learn my lesson and get the Bose.I do a lot of air travel so the 2 things I try to look for in a pair of NC are:1)Compact and easy to store2)Decent NC to reduce plane noiseI feel the NC part of this works fine.What bugs me about this pair is the cord that is attached to the battery stick. It gets tangled and trying to pack this in the laptop bag isn't the best. The battery part is just too big and clunky.
3,Barely worth the money,"I've lots of complaints for the $70 spent:- uses 2 AAAs which I have to keep charged using a separate unit, adding weight & complexity on travel- doesn't actually cancel noise, it only seems to dim low background noise (low steady drones like a faint jet engine), but voices, higher frequencies go right through- ineffective passive noise cancellation- uncomfortable ear pads which are that semi-sticky vinyl that turns to dust after 3 years, especially, if exposed to UV- ""on the ear"" is code for ""undersized earpads""- hisses when turned on which seems to be the main sign it's doing any noise cancellationMy verdict: get the Bose if you can afford it else get something with large earpads for $35 less."
4,Good quality for the price,"I bought this pair of headphones for my birthday because i was too cheap to buy the $300 Bose headphones. I have not used these headphones in a travel environment, but I have found them useful in the home setting. The noise reduction quality is fine, though I don't find it suitable to turn it on without having some music playing, since the noise cancelling causes some pretty annoying noise on it's own.It is good enough to cancel household noise as far as I know, and it definitely enhances the quality of my music. Despite the noise, my only other gripe with this product is that it hurts your ears after extended wear because it compresses them so powerfully. However, since I don't use it for very long stretches of time, I have no problem with it.This is just a good buget noise reduction system that will definitely satisfy you if you don't expect the world of it. It does its job adequately and does its best to reduce the effects of its shortcomings."
4,A Must Listen.,"I wouldn't go so far as to call this a underground classic, but it is definitely Sole's seminal album. For me, only three songs really stand out.. Bottle of Humans being the greatest on the album.. The sample (which escapes me at the moment is beautiful), and his pent-up angst and aggression come through in his lyrics. A great song."
5,Outstanding Classic Sole,"Love this album, Sole has went different directions in his career, but this is the sound that I remember when I discovered him."
3,A Decent Album From An Innovative Artist--Not worth 5 stars,"Sole is a very important person in avant-garde hip hop. He is the founder of Anticon and he is a former member of Live Poets, but this album is not a five star classic as some would have you think. Sole doesn't rhyme, but his delivery/cadence/flow is very impressive. His ""poetics"" (often not really very poetic at all, just cryptic) are interesting, but not much more than that. The beats on this cd start to run together after a while. It is worth a listen, but not a purchase unless you are a diehard avant-garde fan."
2,"Some Dopeness here, But Sole is A Loser","I ain't gonna dis him, because there are some really great songs on this, but Sole is a beeeeyotch. He is a wimpy little punk. I'm sorry. That's just how I feel."
1,depressingly mediocre,"This books lacks both the ferocious, ironic psychological insight and stylistic verve of the best fiction, and the trashy, sexy, honestly lowbrow, no-holds-barred fun of the worst. Kline's novel is embarrassingly self-serious, anemic, empty, soulless, the literary equivalent of Slim-Fast -- sure, reading it'll make the time go by (and it sure won't make you fat), but where's the beef?"
3,A made-for-TV-movie-book....,"Stolid, linear, perfectly grammatical. A mildly intriguingidea that keeps you reading...I laughed once or twice...frowned once or twice. Yawn.Did I read that this author went to Yale? Just goes to show that an ivy league education has nothing to do with having a vivid imagination. Images, details are painted in here and there. It's a S-T-O-R-Y. With an obligatory beginning, middle,ending, and flashbacks. Do they have Erector Sets for novels? Hey, this could be the model."
1,Disappointing,"I was very disappointed by this book. The writing was bland and less interesting than most genre fiction. The plot had promise as a different twist on the coming home theme but was not done well. If the writing is dull, the plot had better be strong. If the plot is weak, then the characters and writing had better be stellar. This book had none of that. If this book was intended to target the Gen-X market, well I'm a Gen-Xer and the only targeting I saw was the name-dropping of popular music groups. You could change those names and this story would fit into any generation."
5,Great DVD,I use this when I teach students on mental illnesses. It is good for them to learn that one can be mentally sick and successful also. Carmen
3,Good handbook for documentation,"I found this to be a good handbook for the type of documentation I often create on projects. I think I wanted more focus on the information design aspect of diagrams / tables, etc. - sort of Dan's take on Tufte. This is more of a comprehensive review of what content a particular document could or should include, how to inflect the doc to different audiences/purposes, and when (or if) to use it in a project. That is important stuff, and Dan does a good job of it. Dan also provides some nice commentary on the future of documentation."
5,"Desktop reference . . . wisdom, inspiration, guidance","Have read now twice. Sits on my desk as a reference, lots of dog-earred pages. Dense with experience, tips and nuances per the intangibles of the design process (Dan's already got the tangibles down cold). I've had a number of my clients (internal and external) read just the Introduction, and have made great progress. A unique volume, very practical. Kudos Dan! - Andrew Schechterman Ph.D. (www.linkedin.com/in/andrewschechterman)"
5,"Excellent Web Design, and Marketing Communication book",I can't think of a better resource to refer to in developing the Discipline of communicating graphically. Also it is a verry fast read. An excellent tool set when combined with a refrence book like The Design of Sites: Patterns for Creating Winning Web Sites (2nd Edition)
4,full of information,an easy read and jam packed with vital information when working as an interaction designer.
5,Useful for taking big projects in small bites,"I am responsible for evaluating and coordinating the re-design of a large library website. Since I know the process, I don't read the explanations of this book in depth, but I like it as a reference. I consult it when I know I need a certain type of document, but don't remember the best way to format the information, or have forgotten all the steps involved. The examples are clear and helpful. Why re-invent the wheel? I've developed similar solutions in the past, and they worked."
4,Great in-depth methodology on UX design,"Great book for ux professional. Lots of in-depth techniques on each step of the ux design process. However, for small and medium companies, this approach might be too formal, and may need to be adapted to be more flexible."
4,A Good Reference for WebSite Design,"I'm using this text for my CIS 3900 Business Web Architecture course at Western Michigan University. THis text is geared more towards the designers perspective of wed site creation, more so then development. It's an easy to read text,not full of overly complicated jargon, and tends to be a fast read with lots of helpful diagrams. For anyone looking to explore the dynamics of creating a web site to meet the needs of your client, it certainly is a good source of information and topics to consider during the process."
2,Not Essential.,"The Rurouni Kenshin movie is, to put it simply, poor. The Rurouni Kenshin TV series is pretty good, but this movie brings down the series as a whole. If your looking for a good Anime movie check out Akira or Sailor Moon Super S."
4,Amazing Movie But,"Samurai X the movie is an amazing film but the voice actors are terribly weak and any true fan of the series will realize this as soon as they start talking. They take so much away from the film, Kenshin sounds like a young and inexperienced child, Kaoru's always whining and I mean way more than she does on the series, Yahiko might as well have grown a few feet and a beard cause he sounds like a grown man, and Sanosuke's new voice isn't deep enough.The Samurai X Movie is just another story of how Kenshins past catches up with him. Of course once again Kenshin is faced against a furious man obsessed with revenge and confused of how the deadly Battousai that once took someone from him could turn into Kenshin. I suggest watching Samurai X - The Motion Picture with the Japanese audio and English subtitles because it will hurt your ears to hear these amazing characters with these horrible voices."
4,It's awesome...,"This movie is great. The d.v.d. has an incredible sound and picture but it falls short on the extras, thats why I give it 4 stars and not 5. But besides that there is nothing bad about this d.v.d. If you are not a fan of samurai X(a.k.a. Rurouni kenshin) you will be after you see this movie."
1,"samurai x, the motion picture","Very poorly done! The motion picture did not even use the same English voice actors as in Rurouni Kenshin. The voice actor for Kaoru did not even know how to pronounce ""Sanosuke"". It is best to watch in Japanese with English subtitles. This movie is a waste of time and money."
4,Good but annoying,"All right ,I have to tell you im obssed about Kenshin and this was a good movieIn the beginning of the movie,they show a scene...all right?then during the first thirty minutes, Kenshin,Kaoru,Sanoske,yahiko talk...then they show the the scene at the beginning of the movie again.Then Kenshin and his group meet this new person with really THICK eyebrows,then they show the scene at the beginning again.They just kept on showing THE FIRST SCENE!I was like!OKAY THAT""S ENOUGH NOW!YOU DONT HAVE TO KEEP ON REPEATING IT OVER AND OVER!but toward the end it got interesting,there was action and it was really good then romance then drama.Although,this movie is more like a T.V. series compared to Reflection,Trust and Betrayal, they drew them a little different.The songs were good too,Oh and watch it first in english,cause if you watched it first in japanese,you wont be able to stand the english dubbing.That's what I always do."
4,A long chapter of the series,"This movie might fit between almost any of the series chapters. Its just like a long one of them. It was the first Kenshin thing I watched in full -having tried to see the preludes once, I got stuck with all the violence of the first scenes- so this worked out fine for me in my path to becoming a Kenshin fan. There are a couple of scenes that they abuse in showing them over and over again, but it's ok. As it was for me, it would be useful to give someone who has never seen the series or OVAs a taste of what this is all about."
4,It's alright.,"Samurai x the motion picture is alright,the only reason I bought it was because I am a big rurouni kenshin fan and because I needed some to waste my money.The story starts out with a backround of kenshins life during the revolution(CAUTION:this scene comes out a few times so you might get tired of seeing it).Then later Kenshin and his friend's meet up with a guy named Shigure that was also in the revlution 10 years ago.My favorite scene was when Kenshin fighting shigure in the last battle in the whole movie. This feature is preety much about revenge and making a name for them selves, it's actually very stupid.Like I said in my review the story is alright the fighting was alright the movie is alright I just did not like the dubbing it was just horrible I just had to ger used to it.Only get this if yu are a true rurouni kenshin fan like I am."
4,Flashback to the Bakumatsu,"Kenshin, Kaoru, Yahiko, and Sanosuke take a trip to Hokohama. This is a place of trade and Westerners. Anyway, the movie was overall pretty good. However, there are a lot of flashbacks in this movie. Kenshin flashes back to the Bakumatsu. We see him killing the same guy, over and over. It is very redundant. The fights in the end are fantastic. A very cool Battojutsu technique is seen only in this movie. The music is very fitting as well."
3,Just plane 50/50,"This movie is really base on the Rurouni Kenshin series. What I hate about this movie is their were different english dub voice actors then the one's that do the series on CT. I hated the widescreen on this movie, the animation is not even all that great like the Rurouni Kenshin series is. I hated when Kaour slap Yahiko just because he ran off to go train at a better ninja school he had hope's to becoming a soilder and she was just jealous. The only part I like that was my favorite in this movie was when on the dvd I click on blood bath and it was a war going on between the Japanese and the English it last a pretty good while that part is the only reason why I would watch this movie. The english dub is pitful and 3rd grader can do better then these guys."
3,A simple History lesson,"I Havent seen this movie but theres's a moron on this page who thinks he knows what hes talking about. Sailor red needs to brush up on his history. There is no such thing as a rurounin and it doesnt mean wanderer and the description on his part is a pure guess, ronin is closest to the meaning which means masterless samurai. It just erritates me when people pretend to know something but in reality fall short of a fool."
2,**********DO NOT BUY!**********,"DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!!I bought this on pay-per-view not to long ago,...It started out GREAT!- The story is good,-The syle is nice,-The art style is good,- The art itself is GREAT- The movie-....IT'S -DOWN-RIGHT BORRRINNNGGGG----!!!!!!! The movie almost put me to sleep!-is simply mind numbing!-_-zzzZZZI thoght the story was eehhh...ok. I give the story 3 stars, but the movie....Negative-onecentillion stars! (centillion=303-700 zerros) WHHHAATT KIND OF MOVIE IS THIS??!!!! -I couldn't even pause it! ;_;|"
1,Samurai X - The Motion Picture way too boring,"I thought all the Samurai X Anime were slow and tiresome, I dont think they are worth paying over 20 dollars for. Fight scenes were few.... dialog was plentiful."
4,gread,"good movie, can get boring after a while. Not a good as the ova or series. choice between series or this? series...."
2,Boring!,"I watched this last night, and although the animation was GREAT, it was so dull and boring. I almost fell asleep through it three times, and I couldn't WAIT for it to be over. Two stars out of five for the beautiful animation."
5,Pleeeeeeeeeeease Watch The Anime Serie!!!!!!!!!,"For those who Watch The Rurouni Kenshin for the first time, let me tell you that you don't know what you're loosgin by not knowing the original anime serie. I watched the whole 95 chapters, for me it is the best anime i've ever seen, i even felt very unhappy with the serie finale, anyway, Requiem fot the Ishinshin, is a very good movie but a i dare to say that the could've done better, it is a Battousai Movie, of course they could've done better than that, buttttttttt, no matter what it's Rurouni Kenshin, and just beacuse of that it deserves 5 whole stars"
2,Not very good,"I love the Rurouni Kenshin series and I loved all the Samurai X movies... except for this one.With a totally political story line and a single good action scene that they flash back to it seems like every 15 minutes, I can safely say that this is not a good Kenshin movie, or a good anime movie for that matter. I recommendSamurai X - Trust & Betrayal (Director's Cut), andSamurai X - Reflection - Director's Cut (Rurouni Kenshin). Don't waste time or money on this unless your a real die hard Kenshin fan, and even then think it over.PS. The voice acting is terrible in this."
3,This machine EATS ink,"Good basic printer, sharp quality and nice colors. Decent photo printing. But BEWARE -- this machine is reasonably priced for a reason. It DEVOURS ink, and HP will earn a lot more on refill cartridge sales. Expect to spend more on refills in the first three months than the cost of the printer. That is my experience and I print less than 200 pages per week."
1,LAME: Won't print unless both black and color cartridges are installed,"This is a decent printer, but you are forced to install both a color and a black cartridge in order to have any functionality at all. If, for example, all you want to do is print in B&W or send a fax and not print at all, or just scan an image, you must still install both a black and color cartridge, or the printer will not function at all. To my knowledge, there is no way around this. I got one of these printers second-hand with only a black cartridge (the color was empty and dried up), and I've got to go buy a color cartridge now to even use it for only B&W printing. HP takes advantage of its customers yet again!"
2,carraige jam,"The printer rarely works. It almost always emits an error message stating ""carriage jam."" The only thing that is reliable is the inevitable frustration this causes."
1,not quite all in one,"I am not sure how it works yet it does not come with a USB cable so you can't set it up the day you receive it. I called the company and the person I spoke with the first time did not say go out and buy you one but we'll send it to you and it should be there in 5-7 days,10 days later I call the company I speak to a lady this time and she says sorry we can't send one out for another 38 days, and then I am told that the USB cable is not included. It is ok that you do not include the USB cable when you sell the product even though you need it to set it up and for the printer to work, by the time I get the USB cable my 30 day return time frame is over. thank you HP for such wonderful service, your customer for the last time."
1,"Fragile, Noisy, Frustrating",A fragile noisy piece of junk. This thing has so many flaws that it's hard to keep track.
1,"DO NOT BUY THIS ""PRINTER""","DO not do buy this piece of junk. TO quote my friend : Excessively complex large (bloated) drivers (?) , constantly calling home via the internet (HP likes to spy on its employees too ) ; install failed on one PC, worthless on another. It will fax and copy , but god help you if you need to connect it to a PC to print. I still have my Epson dot matrix."
2,doesnt work well on printing envelope labels,"It puts the labels no where near where I wanted it. Tried it 3 times on one draft envelope. Got the last one right, so I press print again this time with a new envelope. It gave me a print far different from the third one."
4,A little skeptical,My printer and my fax machine decided to break at the same time. I called HP for their trade in/trade out option and was told the 6210 was the replacement model and I ordered it. Afterwards I came to Amazon to read reviews and was very apprehensive about this machine I had just purchased. I anticipated a lot of problems installing the software and getting this machine going based on the reviews I read. I'm happy to say - so far so good! It took me less than a half hour to get it up and going with no problems at all! It is a little noisy and shakes when printing but it's faster than my old printer so I'll deal with the noise and shaking!
4,"So far, so good","Today I installed a new HP 6210 with an almost-new Dell computer. Contrary to other reviews here, I had absolutely no trouble installing it, including the fax features. (The quick-start brochure was very easy to follow.) I won't give it 5 stars until we've used it for a while, but we're pleased so far."
2,Not completely Vista compatible,"This product seems to print well, but the scan button doesn't work with Vista. It simply says ""no connection."" The HP website says the button is not compatible with Vista. Scanning from the computer does work, however."
1,TERRIBLE PRINTER - DO NOT BUY!!!,"This printer worked perfectly for all of about 2 months. After 2 months, it completely stopped printing for some reason (not due to low ink - I replaced the ink cartridges and it still wouldn't print).The other day I tried to fix the printer, and it didn't work. So I called up customer service, which told me I was out of the warranty period (I bought it over 6 mos. ago), and instead of offering to help me fix it, he tried for about 15 minutes to sell me a new printer!!! Finally I said no thanks, please just fix the existing problem -- to which he said ""in order to continue this call it will cost $34.99 b/c you are out of the warranty period""!!!!! I then found free product support online... kind of like an IM... so I was chatting with a tech person for about 20 minutes, and in the middle of our conversation, in the middle of her helping me, she just signed off!!! Talk about TERRIBLE customer support!!!I will never buy an HP Printer again, ever."
2,Software installs perfectly on ME,"...if you don't mind an installation taking about an hour and a half. The installation was much faster on our XP sp2 -- except that, after four tries and a conversation with tech support, I *still* couldn't get the HP software to run the fax software. (XP has built-in fax software, so there's a workaround, but I'm not paying over a hundred dollars for software that I can't install.) Since our old separate scanner, copier, and fax were working, and we got the old fax to work better with a new answering machine than the 6210, we'll just return it. And, yes, we also noticed the small ink cartridges."
1,mdse never received,merchandise returned to vendor by shipper as damaged in shipment. Cancelled order!!!
1,Simply Awful,"After years of buying HP products, the 6210 has cured me forever from buying HP again. The software is horrible, the printer jams after just a few sheets, the cartriges are expensive and wear out quickly, and tech support is inaccessible.The only reason I gave them one star instead of zero is that once in awhile the fax machine actually manages to send a fax.I am actively looking for another printer (just not one from HP)."
1,Terrible product,"I bought this product to replace a previous HP all-in-one printer I had. This is by far the worst printer I have ever owned. It does not like photo paper, it is unreliable and it goes through ink quickly as the cartridges are tiny and overpriced. Do yourself a favor - DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!"
2,WORST PRINTER EVER!!!,"I have had this printer for less than one year. Now, 9 months later, it clips pages, the alignment mysteriously is off all of a sudden and it has slowed more than half in speed.As if this isnt enough I have had to re-build my parents HP tower.Buy a Mac and a Cannon. Best duo ever."
3,NO SUPPORT FOR MAC SHARING,"There are 2 computers in this household (both Macs), which need to share the printer. We plugged this printer directly into one of them, and tried every trick we could find online or off to get the other one to recognize it as a shared network printer. NO LUCK. We finally purchased an Airport Express, which we now use as a print server. However, this means that we have NO access to the printer's ""all-in-one"" functions (scanning, faxing), since the HP software will not recognize the printer unless it is plugged in to the computer directly.It's a fine printer, but if I'd known all this in advance, I wouldn't have wasted the money buying an all-in-one machine."
1,Save $$$ and aggravation ....,"This is the second one of these I've owned and like the first one, just after the 1 year warranty expired, a ""Paper Jam"" stopped the machine from working.I threw the first one away because HP won't offer tech support to out of warranty products unless you pay them $69.95. Instead I bought another one. Big Mistake. Same problem and you can't even get a support rep on the phone until your CC is charged (more than 1/2 the cost of the printer).I've learned the hard way and will now switch to Dell. My advice: Stay away from HP ""All in One"" Printers, they are cheaply made and come with what must be the worst support in the industry."
2,Don't Buy This Printer,"I just GLADLY replaced this printer. This was not a good all-in-one printer experience for my husband and I. The plastic parts were cheap and broke easily. After a few months, the printer display said that there was a paper jam, and never stopped saying there was a printer jam for a year, and there was not. This rendered the faxing function useless.Don't buy this printer. It isn't good. There are many other solid all-in-one printers on the market that outshine this cheaply made machine."
2,Works well for a few months,"At first, I was VERY pleased with this printer. After a few months, I kept getting a ""carriage jam"" error. I have no jams, buj to reset the printer takes some cumbersome effort. I got online, and learned that this is a COMMON and known problem with this printer. Shop around -- the printer is great, except these ""carriage jams"" appear out of nowhere and for no reason -- a glitch -- and it takes up to five minutes to reset the printer to work again. Good printer, until it jams....UPDATE: The scanner does not work with VISTA. Known issue per HP."
1,Product Not Delivered,"I ordered hp 6210. Payment was taken. Amazon sent me an email CONFIRMING THAT MY PRODUCT HAS ALREADY BEEN SHIPPED !!!!I never received the product. 2 weeks passed. I called the vendor (not Amazon). Was told they didn't have the product in stock, and they NEVER SHIPPED IT. On what grounds did Amazon CONFIRM to me that the product was shipping two weeks before?I demanded a refund. Seller tried to pass of another obsolete product. I said NO. Still don't have the refund.RIDICULOUS. PATHETIC. My faith in Amazon is severely tested. I'll be very careful before ordering with Amazon in the future."
1,Doesn't Work With Windows 7,"I used this product for years with Windows XP and Vista, and it was functional, although not that great. It works well for copying photographs onto photo paper, and photo printing is decent. However, after upgrading to Windows 7, I can no longer use the scanner. The images are all faded to the point where they are barely visible. The fax function has always been unreliable and does not work at all with my VOIP phone line (I use Ooma). It occasionally worked with my previous Vonage line."
4,"Happy for a small business use, though expensive","I really think the only problem with this printer is the cost of ink, which is the printer's price catch. Regarding use, we use it in a very small business with a medium activity, but sometimes we need to print 25 to 50 heavy duty 20-page handouts and it has worked fantastically well! I have had it for over 5 years and it is still kicking!"
4,Works as advertised,"I have used this printer for about 2 years at home, and have never had any problems. The software installed easily, and the printer works as advertised. It's good for light-duty printing, scanning, copying, and faxing. One thing I like about it is that it does not take up much space. Most of the time you can use the automatic document feeder, so you may even be able to set it up on a bookshelf. The USB port makes reading in from cameras and other devices real easy. Perfect for a home office!The only negative thing I can say about it is that it is not real fast, and the ink cartridges are fairly expensive, but that is not a real issue if your print volume is low."
2,Battle Hymn,Expertly made movie that is light but with some great scenes. For example the scene when Hudson's friend flies back to base while mortally wounded with the assistance of Hudson in another plane. It lacks the feel of the horror and danger of war especially towards the end when the logistics of moving 400 very young children through the countryside is not convincingly worked out. They are guided by only about four people and don't seem to be in much danger.
4,Pleasing Movie,I saw this show when I was young and wanted to see it again and I was not disappointed with it. The story was good and the actors performed very well to set it off. Worth watching for the older generation as the young wouldn't understand the true meaning of the show.
4,The Rock as a minister?,"The producers wanted Robert Mitchum to play the leading role for this movie, but the real Dean Hess did not want someone who was convicted for marijuana use to portray him in the movie. So, Hudson got the part. I found it a touching film that portrayed the early days of Korea. The Mustangs had the correct markings and the aerial sequences are good. The enemy Yaks were actually T-28 trainers. War is filled with tragedy, and the killing of civilians in this movie brings that fact home. It is an enjoyable '50's era war film about a war that seems almost forgotten today, which is unfortunate. The airlift rescue of the orphans gives a happy ending to the movie about a war that did not end the way Americans were accustom to."
4,Korean War Story,"Based upon a true event from the ""forgotten war"", this film should be remade and credit given to ALL who made the orphan rescue happen. History shows that the true heros of this event were the ones given little or no credit. Sgt Meryl Strang is not even mentioned. Oh well...the story is compelling and the actors although not Korean do a fine job. Even Rock Hudson gives a good performance...now if only they would remake it and tell the whole story..."
4,Battle Hymn,Very enjoyable film for the period. I'm a history/war enthusiast and was pleased with the purchase and the addition to my library.
4,Pretty Good,"This book would be well-suited for students on theirpediatric clerkship. It is a nice, portable handbookthat covers the basics of pediatrics while not gettingbogged down in the details that are often beyond thescope of medical students. I think that this bookwould be most useful to student in the clinic and onthe wards when they are between patients and need toquickly review or learn the basics of pediatricillnesses. The cardiology section of the book isespecially useful for students as it clearly explainsthe essentials of pediatric heart disease while alsoproviding a graphical representation of each murmurand sample EKG findings associated with each defect.The Hot Key and mnemonics are helpful in purveying thenuances and important pearls of pediatrics to thosewho are new to the specialty. In general, I cannotthink of any weak points with this book. I think thatit would be an excellent book for students on theirpediatric rotation."
5,Also excellent for students.,"Great book for students as well. problem based. Excellent for Sub-I's. Fast pre-read for interns. Has most pediatric specialties, including NICU. Nice Primer on vents. I let my interns borrow it for primers on vents. Nice bits about congenital heart defects as well.You see?harriet is not the only pocket book."
4,Quick and easy calibration,"Pre measured standards make recalibration easy for those who are not full time chemists and just want to get the job done.I use the pH meter to keep track of the boiler water in my home heating system. With four water loop zones, five pumps and a #2 oil fired cast iron boiler coupled to an automated coal fired boiler I keep my boiler water close to a 10.5 to 11 pH to avoid premature water loop and boiler failure.These standards are pricey."
2,Not a good starter set,"While this set has a lot of big words in it, it's not the best choice for a starter set of word magnets. It would be great in combo with the basic set. It's pretty advanced as a ""toy"" for anyone in elementary school. I am a published poet and an adult and there were words I needed that were not in this set. I plan to get the original set because I like the idea of creating on the side of my filing cabinet in my office.The Genius Magnetic Poetry Kit"
4,Lots of Fun,"I really like playing with this set. It has lots of big words--some familiar, some not. My only complaint is that I need more little connecting words: prepositions, articles, etc. We run out of those first and have to steal them from existing masterpieces."
1,Sent wrong set,"The set of words I got was not the genius set... even though it was in the genius box. With words like ""corpse, shotgun apocalypse"" I strongly suspect it was the zombie set contained within..."
3,Great Organizer,"As other reviewers have stated, this is a fantastic quality item. The pockets are sturdy, and can easily fit one pair of women's pumps per pocket. Clogs and boots, however, require 2 pockets. Not a big deal - it's great to get them off the floor and organized. I cannot give 5 stars since hanging over the door causes one problem: I can no longer fully shut the door. This is OK when I am by myself, but when I have guests, I need to take the organizer down from the door. This is leading to wear and tear on the loops where the over the door hinge slots in. For now, this is doing its job - but further down the road, I think I am going to look for a sturdy shoe cabinet instead. I hate not being able to close the closet door tight."
4,OK by me,The pocket shoe organizer needs sufficient height so that it won't drag on the floor. I've only found 1 closet (our hall closet) that has adequate height for it.
2,Not as good as other review said,"I bought this item after reading other positive reviews but was very disappointed after about 4 months of light use.First, its quality is unacceptable. I use it for my toddler daughter and son's shoes which are not heavy compared to adult shoes. But one pocket already loosed up and peeled off from the side where the stiches are and the hook to hang it on the bar already broke.Second, I have to hang it behind the door with the 4 hooks but my closet door is narrow than the opened up organizer, which made it impossible to close the closet door now.Third, its pocket is not as spacious. It can hold one pair of kids size 13 shoes or one adult shoe in one pocket. Don't expect to put one pair of adult shoes in there.All in all, I am not happy with the product and back to the market to look for something better."
2,damages door,doesn't hang well on the door. We had to rig cardboard pieces under the part that touches door to get it to lay flat so the door would close. Maybe our doors are more narrow at the top but I wouldn't think so?
4,large and handy on the door!,Great for kids rooms and for teenagers with large feet. size 13 men. fits high top basketball shoes also. quality is holding up so far in the last 3-4 mo. the metal brackets at the top scratch the door and the frame when closed . the best ive found on line.
3,Not Bad,This product is not bad. It does what it is intended to do. It just isn't as sturdy on the closet door as I would have hoped.
4,Good quality,"I ordered this to hang in the garage, on a shelf near the door to help de-clutter the entrance to the house. With three kids in sports and everyday shoes, this helped tremendously. Nice big pockets compared to the ones I looked at in the stores. The hanging hooks and reinforced tabs at the top make it sturdy to hang."
3,Wish the pockets were a little wider,"We have filled the shoe organizer to its capacity and it does work great to get the shoes off the floor and easy to access. However, certain types of shoes (running shoes, heels) require two pockets for the pair so I wish the pockets were a bit wider."
4,Got the job done,This is what it says it is. It holds my shoes. It doesn't get the 5th star because my men's size 9.5 shoes only fit one shoe per pocket. I had been hoping a pair would fit in each pocket.
4,20 pockets does not mean 20 pairs of shoes,"The description seems to say it can accommodate up to 20 pairs of shoes. For my shoes size 10.5, it can only accommodate 10 pairs of shoes. One shoe to each pocket. I suppose it can accommodate a pair for each pocket if the shoes were smaller.Overall a good hanging shoe storage. I give it 4 stars."
2,.....not happy,"Horrible. It was supposed to be durable enough for my husbands shoes, but within days the metal hooks bent and wouldn't stay on the door...."
4,well built but to small for size 13,my size 13 crocs only fit 1 to a pocket contrary to other reviews. It is pretty well built though. I give it 4 stars because i got big feet.
5,Rubbermaid Shoe Rack,"I'M 100% PLEASED W/ THIS PRODUCT. FITS NICELY OVER CLOSET DOOR; HAS BIG, DEEP POCKETS FOR ANY SHOE & IS VERY AFFORDABLE."
1,"Please remove ""How to Draw"" title.","This book should be titled, ""A Different Way To Draw Action Dragonball Z"" When I bought the series of these books for my children, I had hoped it taught sound and practiced drawing techniques that I wanted them to see, inline with what I taught them. Disappointed to say the least. If you get a chance to look at the book before you buy, just do one thing first... Look at page 16... need I say more.(ps. the 1 star is for the colouring-in use my youngest gets from it)"
4,Easy Piston,"This was my favorite Piston symphony when I bought the LP. Since then I have collected all the other symphonies of Piston but never found this on CD until recently. It's fairly simple music. The first movement reminds me of Harris. But the last movement has so much rythm, it is a fine ending."
4,Clonewars,"Do you want ot read a great series book that was so good that it was made into a movie? Then pick up the book Starwars 2: Attack of the Clones. Every chapter there is something going on, even in the first chapter. It has loads of mysteries and fighting. The Jedis have to find an assassin. Even if you have seen the movie it is still an exciting book to read. if you want a few more details than the movie had, you better definitely read this book. It is not hard to read and is fun to read also. The book is Sci-fi and is very creative. It takes you away to a far away land, in a different galaxy. There are wars, guns, and robots. If you like all of these things, be sure to pick up this book!"
4,"Similar to the movie, maybe too much","This comic book nowadays called graphic novels, is quite similar to the movie, maybe too much. While it leaves out key spoiler scenes it does recreate the feel and sequences of the movie quite well. The dialogs are of course adapted to the medium and the drawings are quite simple and straightforward, yet beautiful. One of the flaws of this graphic novel is that it does not add much to the plot or the pciture itself, while it could have been used to tell the unseen part of the movie, it just recreates it the most faithfully and accurately possible. I think it's more a souvenir or collectible than a real comic book. Worth getting if you collect SW stuff."
2,Not what I wanted,"I guess it's my fault but I thought this was the actual novel for the movie, not just a comic book depicting the movie. I did not actually read it."
1,copy cat,This book is nothing more than a rehash of the small tutorials most plugin author send with their product. You'd have more luck playing with the plugin and learning through it's interface than making sence of the gibberish put out by the Reeses. This book is totally unessary and a waste of good paper. Nothing here that you can't find better on the net.
1,Don't waste your money!,"This book was made for a quick buck and nothing else. Not only is it out of date, the free plug-ins they give you only work with old versions of MAX. There are other MAX books that are much better. About as helpful as Cliff Notes on a bad day."
1,Don't waste your money,"This book is a big waste of time and money. It shows you pictures of mediocre plugins, and the plugin authoring section is completely pathetic."
1,One of the worst products ever-AVOID!,"This product was very difficult to setup. I had to run the web based setup over and over again, in between shutting down my computer and DSL modem several times in sequence. I finally had to call their tech. support line (based offshore, hardly spoke English well). And when I was eventually able to get connectivity through this router, my speed seemed slower than before and some images on certain websites refused to load in my web browser. I returned this Netgear back to the store the next day because by that time my connection kept breaking off.What happened? I thought Netgear was supposed to be a good brand. Based on this product, I would never buy another Netgear again. Terrible product, terrible reliability. You could and would do better with a Linksys or D-Link router instead."
2,Terrible throughput problems with Netgear WGU624,"I just purchased the recently released Netgear WGU624 dual band a/b/g wireless router with the matching Netgear WAG511 adapter and I am having troubles downloading files at the maximum speeds offered by Comcast. Both wired and wireless computers are affected. Transfering within the LAN is no problem, I get better speeds than I did with my old routers, but trying to download from any site on the WAN, my speeds slow significantly to anywhere from 30k to 2k. I have no idea why. Browsing with Firefox seems fine though. Playing with the MTU values have no effect."
1,Useless,Had to reboot router constantly due to lost signals and Customer Support non-existent. Abandoned Netgear for Belkin which is Outstanding.
1,Crap,"Same as everyone... pain in the butt to install. It managed to disable my wireless rather connnecting it... The tech support guy, clearly reading a computer screen somewhere in India, was clueless, a jerk on top of it, and rude... Finally after getting it connected, it now drops the connection repeatedly just as advertised in the other reviews... I should have listened...."
3,Over rated Pelican light,"Light output is less or comparable to the Pelican 4300 Nemo which weighs less and consumes smaller batteries. This thing weighs a ton with the large 8 D batteries loaded. One must have muscle to be holding this light, not for the weak. Would not buy again but go for the Pelican 4300 Nemo instead."
1,Arrived flat went straight into recycling.,"Not worth your money this battery is junk it arrived flat and went straight into recycling, not worth your money."
5,Simply Amazing!,"To think that I have spent 20+ years reviewing magazines of splendor to learn now that it was all at my fingertips by reading this small, most useful, decorating guide. It is layed out perfectly in the order that each task is be accomplished and it ""teaches"" you the steps that it takes to be successful. I found it easy to follow. Like Carol says repeatedly, nothing is hard if you are given a sound plan. I am not accustomed to writing my thoughts but this product makes dreams of having the environment you want around you a reality! The content steps are each addressed thoroughly and without mincing words and there is nothing left out! You or anyone you know can acheive the most desired results from whatever project you are wishing to accomplish! It was and is something that I will use again and again EVERYTIME I decorate!"
4,Inspired Musicianship,"This offering from ex-Wilco-ite Jay Bennett shows the artist's ability to create mood and images in this attention-grabbing collection of mostly softer-edged songs. Somewhat Americana, somewhat alt-rock, the album primarily shows off Bennett's vocals, which are tender and expressive and his guitar playing, which is stunning. Standouts are 'Cajun Angel' and 'Curiosity'."
2,could've been better,"Jay Bennett, talented ex-Wilco guitarist, releasesrushed sounding stripped down solo effort.Song writing is not Bennett's forte, some niceplaying here, however.Wait for Wilco's new one."
3,Thinner,This one's a lot flimsier from the one I had 15 years ago. Numbers seem a little smaller and harder to read too.
3,If you already have a Buck collection...,"I'm a big fan of Buck, but this is a concert that would be enjoyed a lot more on DVD. The banter and medley of songs doesn't make for great listening. Possessing the pictures and liner notes with the CD will make you wistful."
4,Good clipper,This clipper works great for all around cutting and blending. Doesn't have the power a wahl senior would have but a good clipper all around. I recommend getting the andis purple magnetic guards. I am not a professional but I do cut my own hair and some family and friends. So all around good clipper for those who are passionate about cutting and for those who like to collect clippers and trimmers.
3,Adequate,I bought this clipper thinking that there would be a great difference between this and my Fast Feeds. Which the only difference besides the color of the body and the blade is that the Fast Feeds adjust closer than the Speedlines.
2,Ordinary,"I don't know about you, but I crochet to make something uniquely interesting. I can go out and buy the sort of thing in this book. Disappointing."
4,"Works well, though a bit oversized for my particular drain","I purchased this splash guard because the one that came with our disposal kept popping out of place and splashing water everywhere. This Ace splash guard is an improvement because it's ""fingers"" pretty much lay flat and don't splash water. Problem solved. I took off one star because the Ace guard is a bit oversized for my disposal and there doesn't appear to be any way that I could have known that before I bought the guard. I still managed to press it into the hole though, so it's working out. Given the lack of selection available on replacement splash guards, I'd probably purchase this one again."
4,Great sweeper!,"I received this sweeper and used it immediately. It was easy to put together and was excellent for cleaning animal hair. The belt did come off the first time I used the vaccuum when it grabbed my telephone cord, but I was aware from reading the reviews on Amazon.com that this is a problem with this sweeper. It only took me about 10 minutes to put the belt back on, and I have been more careful and the belt hasn't jumped off since. I would not pay $500 for this sweeper, but I got a terrific deal for a great sweeper at $99!"
4,Best vacuum in years,"In the past my husband and I have always bought name brand vacuums, by doing so you expect more than what you get. We have had vacuums from 150.00 to 250.00, and they either wont't pick up the cat and dog hair, to belts breaking on a weekly basisWhen we got the Royal we were very surprised due to the price being reasonable and the quality of the product. My husband even said for this price, we could afford to buy one each year."
4,I like it,I really like this vacuum. It does an excellent job of cleaning my carpets and it is really powerful.I haven't had any problems with it at all by the grace of God and it it not too heavy when I lift it up the steps.
1,"It does, and not in a good way","I've had my 7300 for a month now. It has been a terrible product with non-existent customer service. As soon as I used it on a hard floor, the deck became completely ineffectual on carpet. Thereafter the hose would pick up dirt but the deck would not. By the third use, there was no suction whatever, a tremendous amount of air was being expelled from the HEPA filter, and the hose holder had come loose. Emails to the help site and calls to the help line remained unanswered. This company also makes Regina and Dirt Devil vacuums, so when I shop for a decent one after returning this garbage, they have at least done me the favor of narrowing my selection by three brands!"
2,Too powerful - potential fire hazard,"Wow! This vacuum is very powerful. I was so excited, it was sucking up difficult cat hair with no effort. I have had this product only one day... I detached the hose to use an attachment and had the cord under the vacuum for less than a minute. The vacuum sucked all of the rubber off the cord, stripped it to the copper wiring and burned or ripped the bristles off of the under carriage brush. This literally happened in less than a minute. It is very simple to accidentily get the cord under your vacuum. I was not even using the under carriage of the vacuum - I was using the hose feature. This seems very dangerous and a potential fire hazard. Be very careful."
1,Problems with Brush Belt,"While this vacuum works well when it works, the belt drive assembly is a mess! Either my machine is defective or the design itself is terrible. The belt comes off after only a few minutes of vigourous use and without the belt turning the brushes, the vacuum is useless on carpet! Definitely a waste of money."
3,Two of the same,The bowls are nice seem to be well made and attractive. The colors are good. But we wanted one bowl with with each of the four designs shown in the photo. We received two bowls with the same design.
4,A very short book....,"...maybe a tad too short. The book does a good job of explaining what archaeology is and how is works. From microwear to monuments, from dating methods to grave robbing, from gender issues to mass tourism, the book tries to touch on almost everything that is linked to archaeology or related to it. In some ways it tries to cover too much for such a small book and I finished the book wishing for more details on the history of archaeology and how it works."
4,"Unique, Fun, Difficult","This game seems like a fun, family game, but is fact a (usually) serious RC car simulation, which is not necessarily a bad thing. Still, you must know that the game is difficult and requires practice. New players can't simply pick up a control and do well in a multiplayer race.Otherwise, this would be a perfect game. The graphics are amazing, even by today's standards, and the tracks are wonderfully inventive - everything you've ever wanted to do with RC cars, you will do in this game. You can also design your own tracks. There are courses for multiplayer battles and tricks. Finally, the one positive aspect of the game's difficulty is that you will find plenty of depth. Not a bad choice for the price."
3,RC-Racing at its average,"An interesting racing game indeed. Few companies have tried making games with the feel of an RC car. This game accomplished it well. It feels just like the real thing (I know, I still play with them myself). There are a TON of cars to choose from, all with different characteristics. With some of the faster cars, you may find yourself moving faster than the frame-rate can keep up, but its pretty minor. The only problem I had was the computer intelligence. Any of you that have seen advertisements for the Dream Cast have heard the slogan ""it's thinking"" as well. This means that the computer has learned your play tactics and uses different techniques to stop you. In this particular game, the cars become too smart after a while and the game becomes less fun, and more challenging. This is a plus to some and a minus to others. Overall, a good, fun, addictive game. But rent before you buy."
3,Your Basic Run-of-the-Mill Port,"ReVolt is an average racing game. The graphics are better than the PSX & N64 versions, but pale in detail and frame rate to the PC version. The controls are waaay too loose also. It's nothing spectacular."
1,THE OPPOSITE OF GOOD,"The worst thing I did was buy this game. I should of had rented it but I didnt. TAKKE MY ADVICE, DO NOT BUT THIS GAME. There are no graphics, there is no good sound, and also the cars are so small. I made this mistake, dont let this happen to you."
1,Dissapointed,"My friend gave me this book for my birthday becuase I love reading fiction. The story was confusing at times and the characters were not developed as they should. When I read about the elf I was really excited because I love elfs since the LOTR, but this one elf is definately no Frodo. The characters name were confusing and when the story got really good and interesting it was almost at the end of the story. I hope the author writes another book and creates a series, that way I will not feel so dissapointed and get to know the characters better."
1,TERRIBLE BOOK,"If you are considering this book based on the two good reviews it got -- stop -- they must have been written by friends of the author. This book has so many problems -- the character's have no depth whatsoever, the theme is lost, the protagonist of the story is weak. To compare this to Tolkien is to insult Tolkien lovers everywhere. I am very sorry I ever picked this up and I would not recommmend it to anyone."
1,Sad book of movie reviews,"The author does not seem to want to tell the story of a comedian that did put his mark on the world, and would have moved further in this world had he lived longer. The author seems to want to put his 2 cents in as a movie critic instead. I am sure there were many great stories about John Candy, but the readers don't hear a one of them. Please avoid this book if you have your heart set on learning about the man, John Candy."
3,Candy's life about hardships and with a complex problem!,"John Candy's story is told in this penetrating biography tells about the off-screen comedians self complex and troubled problems with his weight and alcoholism, and his smoking that gained him over 300 pounds. And with his deeply rooted anxieties about his success, money and his self-worth. But above all that on-screen Candy was a funny, gentle, soft-hearted and affable also loved by millions of television & movie fans for playing characters who almost always conveyed much of the real man. Like ""SCTV"" where Candy's skecth characters came up to Mayor Tommy Shanks, Johnny LaRue and Stan Shmenge. And his best remebered known film roles like ""Uncle Buck"", ""Plane Trains and Automobiles"", ""Splash"" and ""Cool Runnings"". This is a tale of a comedian at war with his greatest instrument and a riveting portrait of a man's battle with his private demons!"
1,Do not waste your time,This book is about twice as long as it needs to be. It is way too wordy and lacks depth. I read two to three books per week and usually pass on my used books to others. When I completed reading this one I literally threw it in the trash. What a waste of money and time!
1,This man is so critical!,"This book is basically a huge movie review! I thought I was the only one who thought this but a majority of the reviews on here say the same. I hate this writer. All he does during the whole book is criticizing John's movies (including Uncle Buck) and gives his opinions on John and other actors performances. I learned NOTHING about Candy's childhood. He mentions in the book that John has a traumatizing childhood but didn't even explain why.Dear Martin Knelman, I did NOT read this book to get summaries and your opinions on John Candy's movies! You ruined a couple of endings for me. Thanks a lot."
1,A straw out of beetle's head?,"This book is odd if not disconcerting. The personification of insects then subsequent dismemberment and consumption of insect ""friends"" is a bit over the top. This book is geared towards the 2-4 year old age range - cute bugs being turned into a drink/food (a confused beetle with a straw out of it's head, a caterpillar turned into a hot dog as the caterpillar is looking at himself about to be eaten, etc.) If you look at it from a child's point of view, it might be confusing if not upsetting to see animals' legs being eaten (like the case of the bee who has his knees ripped off so the spider can eat them with it's tea) or seeing the spider eat it's ""friend"" after having them over for lunch. There's better books to teach the food chain concept, that's for sure. I'd be inclined to give this two stars if it had better illustrations, but it doesn't even have that, so, one star it is."
1,DISTURBING!,"I picked this book up at the library without looking through it first. That is the last time I will do that! I sat down to read it to my 3 and 4 year olds and was horrified by the content. There are better ways to illustrate the food chain than to have the spider is eat its ""friends"". The ""prey"" were way too personalized.Inside the flap of the book it says:""The roly-poly spider longs to have some friends for lunch--literally! A beetle, a caterpillar, and a bee soon find that their hungry friend wants more than just their company. She is planning to eat them!"""
1,Horrible,"I never even received these briefs. They were shipped to an old address and the seller did nothing to help me get a new shipment to my new addres. If you are looking for any inkling of customer service, you will NOT find it with this seller. Do not buy from this seller!"
3,Good,Thanks for sending me my book :)I appreciate you for sending it so soon ! Nice doing business with you !
4,Good but can be heard,"This is a basic hour meter. They are mechanical and do ""click"" about every other second. Use in an application where they will not be heard."
2,Cliche,"As the story goes toward the end, it becomes less interesting. If anything surprise me, it's how these people dare to use so much cliche here without annoying their customers; And I RECOMMEND it to some of my friends for this reason - you won't believe that anime of this quality can be so famous! (since it's created by the Slayers' author.)"
3,Missing quite a lot,"Though this two-hour documentary does cover Keef's full life, right up to the moment, almost, it lacks a great range of commentators to really round things out. Keith himself only appears rather briefly, in old clips, with nothing done exclusively for this dvd. None of the other band members were interviewed for this disc, and not even old film clips are included. Instead, we get a bunch of nobodies commenting, including the usual cast of Brit and American music journalists, obscure musicians and one or two people with actual connections to the band, though mostly from the very early days. The gist focuses on Keith's guitar playing. Most of the albums are commented on. You will get a decent picture from this movie, but it's not what it could have been."
4,Keith Richards: The Human Riff,"Over all a very good and informative DVD. However a lot of the terms used I did not understand, but if you have knowledge of music it would have been great. Keith Richards is great."
4,Best Odorless Garlic,"I should say the ONLY odorless garlic supplement I've found on the market. High quality. Seems like they changed from capsules to hard tablets though, I'm not so sure about that...Update: I'm disappointed these are no longer gel caps (or little dissolvable capsules, whatever you call them). They are just large raw tablets now and I gag every time I take one! boo!"
4,"Choppy, wanting but reminiscent","I remember watching this movie and shortly into it (at the slow car chase), thinking this music is really, really good. I've searched for it ever since and it took me months to get my hands on this CD. The first listen leaves a choppy impression. The cuts are somewhat short, end abruptly, and leaves you wanting more from Kraemer. There also isn't much flow between songs, which adds to the choppy feel. But by the end of the CD, I felt Kraemer put together some tremendous music and I ran it back for another listen. Tantalizing use of timpani drums and castanets; reminisicent of big budget Mexican westerns. This score truly draws you into the movie."
3,Bommers' War,"This is a good book. I like this book. Seriously, Vidda has managed to mix fact and fiction in a way that is both enjoyable and educational. Being the same age as the characters in the book, it brought back memories, for today's generation it's a way to experience another generation."
4,What a trip this book is!,"This is a wonderful accomplishment. Although fairly long, the book reads easily and quickly. Vidda Crochetta has an enviable knack for clear, straightforward writing, free of stylistic device. It moves. It is a tour de force.My criticism is that at my age, I have read a few similar books. Also some parts could be eliminated, some could be more outrageous or more eventful. The author may have been too literal if the book was based (loosely?) on actual life actual experiences. The several explicit sexual acts are also not to my taste. They were too real, no mystery in them.Having said that, I feel enlarged having read the book, even though the narrator offers no moral perspective or insight. The author leaves the readers to draw their own conclusions. In any case, I wish I were in it since I felt I knew so many characters that were. It is of tremendous value as it is and I wish I had written it."
1,A triple threat.,"Dull, depressing, and declasse. While I knew that this book wouldn't be highbrow or particularly insightful, I expected it to be marginally interesting. It's neither illuminating nor illustrative, it's just plain icky. I actually needed to bathe after reading this book. Skip it. There are scads of other ""looking for the lost America in rural towns"" books that manage the issue -- and the story -- much better."
5,Delightful reading!,This beautifully written book allows the pleasurable ingestion of numerous curious and intriging facts by coating them with honey. I have never enjoyed a non-fiction book as much!
2,Won't Last,"If you are lucky, when you first purchase this it will work...for awhile anyway! But if you have the 14.4 battery then there are not alot of choices. That is besides buying a whole new set of tools (which I can't afford). I am going to look for an after-market brand. It may not last any longer but maybe it will be cheaper! Good luck with this one."
2,B&D 14.4 charger,"Not sure if it is the charger or my 2 14.4 batteries, but they are not charging. I am going to buy another battery to test it. Bad part is the battery will cost me more than the charger."
1,Poor delivery,"This has been the worst order we have every place with Amazon. They stated it was in stock, receieved a note it was shipped then in the same day was told it will be three weeks before it was shipped. Both Amazaon and their supplier did not care and thought is amuzing."
3,"Good resource book, but...","Some of the pages had been torn out. I know it was ""used"" but I expected the book to be complete."
5,Exactly as described....,I'm very pleased with this battery and the seller. It arrived timely and has worked extremely well now for several weeks. And a great price too! I highly recommend!!!
5,Still great...,"This disc is a return to the studios -- Channel One, to be precise -- by not only the Upsetter himself, but Niney (the Observer, I assume, unless there is more than one Niney running around out there). It's NOT a dub disc, but features vocals, particularly the fascinating and colourful voice of LSP himself, though Niney is very much present; I haven't sat down to brood on the lyrical content yet (noticing, really, only that one song poses the question ""Who shot King Tubby?"" as its chorus). Musically, it's wonderful -- perfectly produced by Niney, with Sly and Robbie as the rhythm section, the vocals intertwining and playing off each other in constantly engaging ways. This is great stuff -- not just great reggae, but something more, something slightly different and very much alive. Cool proof that Perry remains great."
2,Not for those who don't have frequent penetration!,"This is an okay product. There is what seems to be a latex sleeve over top of a standard vibrator, which is nice so if something happens to the sleeve you can just replace it with a new one. The end of it is very flexible which is what makes it soft. However, I thought in the picture that it looked narrower than it actually is. I am a single mom and not dating and I don't masturbate very much, maybe once a week, so this was a little too big around for me! It felt ok, but would have been much better if it were a bit thinner because it did make me bleed. The seller shipped very quickly and discreetly, shipping in a plain brown envelope. Oh, and if anyone is wondering, it's not waterproof."
3,mr softee,took a few days longer than expected....A bit bigger than what was advertised and it smelt a bit fruity. It is soft though... but the smell really throughs you off.
1,Oregon Scientific Waterproof MP3 Player,"I purchased this item in May for use in deep water aerobics. When it arrived, I found that the battery would not hold a charge for more than a few moments and consequently I was unable to program it or download music. Also, the backlighting was so poor that the screen could barely be seen. I never used it in the water, but sent it back immediately to Amazon who credited my account quickly.I have since purchased an IPod Nano with an H2O waterproof housing and earphones which work like a charm in the deep water. The cost of the IPod ensemble was triple that of the MP3, but worth every penny in satisfaction."
1,disappointed,These t-shirts were not of the quality I have received in the past from 2(x)ist. They are thinner and do not wear like the t-shirts I have purchased from this brand in the past. I have been a loyal customer of this brand because of the quality of the products. What a disappointment.
1,"2(x)ist Men's Short Sleeve Cotton Crew T, 3-Pack","I was sent the wrong product, received a refund for only the shirts (not shipping) when I specifically requested a refund for the shipping as well (because I was sent the wrong product). I've had to follow up on the shipping charges twice, and its been 3 weeks and I have not yet received the refund.More of a problem with Amazon than the shirts. If I was actually shipped the right item, I do love these shirts."
3,They shrink so much!,"These tshirts are constructed fine, but definitely buy them one size larger than you normally take. Mine shrank to tiny proportions. Thank God I am thin."
3,Buyer Beware,"While the contents of this book are beautifully displayed and the instructions are relatively easy to follow, the book is a consolidation of the four individual Home Furnishing Workbooks -- pillows, bed linens, window treatments and lampshades. Unfortunately, that is not indicated in the information presented here. Therefore, if you own them, purchasing this book would be a waste of money."
5,"The 60's meet Punk Rock, and Eveyone wins!","Don't like Punk? You will. Don't like 60's music? You will. Like both? You'll absoultely LOVE this album.I was at my local books-and-music store (yes, I shop in person and online) browsing computer books when I found my feet tapping and my head doing a serious 4-4 beat along to some song I'd never heard of with a seriously rockin' intro. As I started to listen... WAIT! That's ""Sloop John B"", by Brian Wilson! What Gives? Me First, that's what! Needless to say I bought it. I've listened all the way through five times, and I'm ready for another five. My new favorite album, hands down.You'll know every song on here. Ever feel guilty flipping to the oldies station in the car? No more. This stuff really rocks. These guys are having some fun without poking fun. Have fun too. Buy it now!"
5,Super Fun!,"I love Me First and the Gimme Gimmes but this album was so incredibly fun. If you like cover bands that play some of the best in classic music, this is the CD for you."
4,Those cover boys do it again,"A punk-pop supergroup who do nothing but covers, Me First and the Gimme Gimmes are a terrific guilty pleasure and loads of fun. This disc isn't as good as the wonderful ""Have a Ball"" (which focused more on 70s covers), but it's still great. Highlights include ""Runaway,"" ""My Boyfriend's Back"" and ""Blowin' in the Wind."" I also love the ""London Calling"" quote at the beginning of ""Elenor,"" as well as the reference to Cat Stevens' conversion to Islam at the beginning of ""Wild World."" The liner notes are hilarious, too. If you like this, check out the aforementioned ""Have a Ball"" and ""Are a Drag"" (which lovingly covers showtunes as only MF and GGs can do). Great stuff! I love it!"
2,Only a hardcore Peni fan is going to enjoy this one.,"My husband is a HUGE Peni fan and recommended this book to me. I have been a fan of Peni for a few years and was interested to read something by the reclusive Nick Blinko. Blinko is a great artist, both his music and his drawings show originality that can only come from a talented mind. I can't say that I think of him as a talented writer after reading this book. It is obvious that Blinko did not write this book for the reader. The whole book reads like a diary entry to me. Important story-telling features are omitted, almost as an assumption that the reader and author share the same mind.I'm guessing that most people who pick up this book are big enough fans to suffer through it and think it was great because of their love for the author. Unless you fit this category, you might want to avoid reading it."
3,"A little interesting, but not a great read","'The Primal Screamer'; with 1st edition copies now selling for around $125, this book is best left uncollected. It's a semi-interesting read (I happened to buy a copy for ten bucks when it first came out), but it's not that good. Written in a Lovecraftian style, it tells the story of some punker-type kids who wander around a dark neighborhood--the source of all evil is apparently a television in the flat's basement that has not been switched off for 20-something years. It's supposedly about a new form of psycho-therapy, etc. The story doesn't really come together, and the book makes it clear that Nick Blinko's talents are definitely musical."
3,I agree with previous poster,"Yes, i am also a big fan of these guys. But you can't help feeling that this is a 'let's record something fast cause we have other things to do' kind-a record. Of course, with players of this experience and caliber something is bound to stick. Listen before buying!"
3,Some good songs,"Let me start by saying I'm a HUGE Frisell and DeJohnette fan. The duo thing is nice - but really it's just improvising with little or no discussion in advance. Vamp/Modal stuff - if that, sometimes.I'd rather hear these guys tackle some new music but there are some strong 'songs' on this recording. Most are kind of weak though. Beware."
3,And this is??,"I've been collecting this series since V1 and I still to this day wonder why. Few mech battles, very little story, and talk, talk, talk. This anime moves at a snails pace even compared to DBZ! ""So why do you have 8 volumns, space?"" I dunno! I just keep thinking this series is going to go somewhere and it isn't. If you like yakkedi smackedi talking go for it. Looking for a good mech battle, forget it."
1,Wish I knew how comfortable this is...,"My wife and I purchased a locking Dutailier glider and ottoman at USA Baby in Tukwilla WA. Ours was white with a custom covers. This was mid-June 2005. After paying for it we were told that these chairs are build to order in Canada and that we would receive the chair August 17th.August 17th came and went and Dutailier has not shipped our chair to us. Our baby is due soon and we can't wait forever for this chair. My wife would have liked to start using it already, but at this point I'm doubtful that it will arrive before the baby.The floor demo chair was super comfortable. It should be for the price tag. Unfortunately, their delays make this not worth the trouble. I plan to get a full refund and buy something cheaper that I can take home same-day if it does not arrive on my doorstep by the end of the week.My suggestion: If you really want a Dutailier glider, make sure you order 3-4 months before you even start trying to conceive your child."
1,Long Wait For Nothing,"We waited 4 months for our glider to arrive, after it arrived it turned out not to fit right (the width wasn't deep enough). It wasn't quite like the one we tried on the floor and we don't know why. Babies R Us said we could re-order, but we would have the long wait again. We are deciding on another option instead. I am disappointed, our baby has arrived and I would love to have a comfortable rocker."
3,Happy thoughts,"The authors of this book strike me as enthusiastic, good hearted people. I wasn't able to get much more than that from the book. The text is very general and reads like a seminar ad. There are a variety of lists and organizational diagrams, but they didn't strike me as coming from folks who have successfully overcome management inertia and/or hi-tech boosterism."
5,Good Quality Envelopes,These envelopes were of good quality and were a much better price than I could get them at any of the big box office supply stores. They were packed well and arrived in good shape.
2,Disappointing!,"Purchased this LCD TV, and within three days decided to return it. Thank you, Amazon! LCD resolution, color, and sharpness leave a lot to be desired. Funai doesn't state the pixel count, but it appears to be 640 x 480. The TV is simple to adjust and operate; however, in spite of all my attempts to get a good picture over digital cable, the TV just didn't deliver. My smaller Toshiba CRT delivers a much sharper, brighter, and better contrast picture than this Funai.The Funai is stylish and weighs little. The remote is somewhat sparse and utilitarian. It does have all the necessary connections. It is entirely cheap plastic with somewhat sharp edges. Although it is supposedly tiltable, I was not able to get it to tilt.Perhaps if I had an HD box, the picture would be satisfactory. Price point is good, but for just a little more money there are much better sets to be had."
4,Not as bad as others say.,"Don't know where the previous reviewers found their resolutin numbers, but they were way off. I have this model in my kitchen being fed from a cable HD box (1080i). The sound is ok, but not great. The picture quality is very adeqate. The analog picture quality is horrible, but it is on all LCD's. HD tv's are not designed to display good analog picutre but they do wonderfully on 780p or 1080i. If your buying this to watch analog tv, stick with a CRT. * Analog tv is typically the channels below 100, even with a digital box. Although many cable providers do offer a digital simulcast feed."
3,You get what you pay for.,"Low price, less than stellar quality picture, but provides adequate background coverage all day long in the office."
4,Great value for the money,"I bought a set of SCS- 145.5 speakers after my subwoofer went out in an older set of SCS- 135's. At $189.99, these speakers are an excellent value. You're not going to get the same kind of punch that will out of a $2000 JBL setup, of course, but if you have a small living room like mine, these speakers are more than adequate. They also seem to be much improved versus the old SCS- 135 models. The speakers are well balanced, and the bass is meaty, but not overpowering. Highly recommended!"
4,Just what you need in a small room,"Is ok, with this speakers. Very shields, good sound, very good bass. Not professional, but you have what you pay."
2,"Overall very poor speakers, but Subwoofer is very good","Okay, so I just bought the JBL SCS-145.5 Speaker System and they are absolutely horrible! I'm sorry to say, but the Center speaker is ridiculously underpowered/barely audible with the other satellite speakers (which are also weak and tend to get distorted at higher volumes or with a lot of audio going through them). The Subwoofer is *very* good, however, so I guess the price tag is justified by the Subwoofer (that's why I gave it 2 stars), but the other speakers are pretty much useless. Just in case anyone wanted to know how these were, I'd recommend staying away from them and maybe spending slightly more and getting a better system."
2,Earliest work of Byron Herbert Reece,Amazon has the wrong author listed for this. The three authors in the title wrote the book. The listed author is the publisher. Several of the lyric poems by BHR included in this book were later revised and included in his three books of poetry later published by EP Dutton.
2,not so great,very hard to get the light turned on- have to play with it- not alot of help if you are in the woods & you are trying to find your way to your hunting stand.
2,Re-Review of this product.,"Wrote a review some time back on this. I was DEAD wrong about it. I must have been drunk or sleep deprieved when I wrote the original. Terrible Anime, just consists of violence, ZERO story, and weak characters.Quality of box set is good however. Nice packaging. However don't waste your hard earned money on this. There is a lot of high quality Anime out there, buy that instead. Give 'Big O' a try, or 'Akira', or 'Ghost In The Shell', anything but this 'Mecha Masters' set.For those who read my original review of this, I am eternally sorry. Don't drink whiskey or be sleepy while on Amazon when writing reviews is all I can say..."
4,Queen of the underground,"I first came to know of Jane Jensen after watching the movie Tromeo and Juliet. I was just so intrigued by this adorable creature that played Juliet I just had to find out more about her. To my surprise, I discovered that she made music too. So I just had to get this album since I have such a weakness for female singers. While I must admit with my first listen I thought ""What the #@$% is this."" I gave it a fair chance though, and the more I listened to it. The more I liked it. So much so I had to track down her first album as well."
3,Better,I like Burner better than Comic Book Whore. I bought both the albums after i heard More Than I Can Give off of Comic Book Whore.. Was very pleased with this cd.
5,Excellent book for applying Techniques in Lightwave Now,"This book is one of the most well written books on Lightwave, a 3d animation program. The tutorials Josh covers really walk you through step-by-step, and you really get wonderful results! It was very encouraging to be able to read through each step, and follow along succesfully, and I highly recommend this book for schools teaching Lightwave. The book is easy to use, as it is a large size, and lays flat on your desk. There is room for comments in the margins, and after the chapters, and the author has been wonderful in answering questions. This book teachs you basic skills from how to make an ocean fire, animating textures, basic lighting, and is a MUST HAVE for novice Lightwave users! You will be please with the results!!!!!!"
3,Learn how to write!,"The information is helpful, if you can get to it through the misspellings, punctuation errors, and constant and annoying personal dialogue. I just want to know about lightwave without chit chat. The style of writing is unprofessional and disruptive to learning."
4,Full of Suspense and Good.,"This is a book I would not normally read, but it was a selection for a book club that I participate in, so therefore I read. It was a very good book, but very scary. It is written by two people, Dr Philpin that is a forensic psychologist and Patricia Sierra who held a brief career as a private investigator. This book is written in first person, so you know what the killer is feeling and doing. Also, all the characters are written in first person, so you know how they feel as well or their perception of what is going on. This involves a small cast of characters broken down into three books. It is a story about a serial killer and the chase that ensues so that he cannot kill again. Each chapter is about one person's thoughts and perceptions. It is a very interesting way to write a book and it worked for these two authors. I would probably read more by this author just not one right after the other."
1,Not pro material,"This book may provide basic information for those just beginning to print their own photographs. It will not teach them to print like a pro. In the first 200 pages, the most erudite information I could find was and I quote, ""...next, set the amount. If you don't want a strong effect, a lower number here is best."" Really?"
5,Ground Fennel Seed,I couldn't find this product in the store. I love the size and the price was just right. Love the promptness of the delivery.
2,Not inspirational,"This author had a tough time with motherhood, especially post partum, there is NO doubt about that. I myself had some issues with my tearing and would have been horrified if I had read this book first. But, just reading this for inspiriation alone, I found myself very bored by it. I guess I just didn't like her writing style. She drones on and on and on. I found Anne Lamont's Operating Instructions a much more engaging memoir about motherhood."
1,doesnt work at all!,i am done with 2 bottles already and i could see very little difference in the reduction of tartaras plaque hardens it turns into tartar once you remove the surrounding plaque tartar becomes loose and simply falls offyes well this is just hard core proof that it doesnt do anything but damage your gumsuse baking soda and salt water as a pre brush rinse more effective
5,Original Flavor Plax,"Could not find this product anywhere but here. It is the original flavor, unopened, and ready for use. Great."
5,I LOVE the World Famous Pontani Sisters!,"I used to see them perform their Go Go moves at Barmacy all the time and I get to their dance class as often as I can. Now I don't have to wait for class, I can get my Go Go going at home. I have been doing the work out every day and soon I'll be buff enough for those hot little showgirl costumes. If you're in New York, check out their cabaret show. If not, check their website for tour dates. Either way, get this video! You won't be sorry."
4,Tons of fun!,"I really enjoyed this dvd. I was looking for something more fun than your average workout video and I found it. I read the reviews and decided to give it a try. I did it for the first time yesterday and had a lot of fun and worked out pretty hard! The girls are great hosts, you can tell they're having fun too and they aren't constantly shouting out at you but they do have words of encouragement. They laugh and make a few mistakes (like saying right when they mean left) but they correct themselves and it's fine. The main reasons I only gave this 4 stars are the low production values (not that it affects the workout at all) and the fact that you only learn one routine (although from the clips they show I don't know that I could do all the great moves they do!). Other than that it's a great find and a great buy and anyone looking for a fun way to get your heart going should definately check it out."
5,A Sweating Good Time,"The Pontanis did it again! They played Vegas awhile back and I was at every show! I love those gals and I love this video. With all the retro dance enthusiasts out there, the pontanis have really gotten the 60s down! It's so cool to learn these awesome moves and then take em out to the dance floor.Twist on Sisters!!!!!!!"
5,the power of astro boy,out of all the tv shows you can have your famalysee this is one of the very best ok.and its never boring ever!
2,What the???,"Yeah, I get it..he's both goth and glam. What a cheesey name, better yet, what a cheesey album. I know that he's a Bowie fanatic, and most of us are, but Marilyn Manson allready did this, and he did it much, much, much better. If this album wasn't so expensive I would be nicer, but $37!!! No way! It's way overrated and I seriously doubt that it is out of print. It's probably Glamdork himself selling the thing online so that he can buy some originality. Take that poser!"
4,Good buy,"I bought this set to work out with while toning at home. I am a member of a gym and just wanted something that I could handle easily at home. I'm very pleased with the purchase. The plates are easy to change, well labeled, color coordinated and the bars are cushioned. The set also comes with an exercise chart which gives some baisc exercises for the muscle groups (arms, legs, abs, back etc) and a few simple common sense tips on staying fit and healthy. The only disappointment is that the plates are a bit wobbly, but it's not a major disturbance. I really recomend this set, especially for beginers."
4,Fun to use.,"I bought these because I was looking for free weights and they showed up in my gold box. I'm glad I did. The padded bars are very comfortable and it is very easy to change the weights. The weights are a little wobbly, but it doesn't bother me at all. The packaging is more problematic as some of the weights are not wrapped in plastic and the styrofoam shipping material seems to have fused with the coating on the weights and had to be claened off. However, that same coating makes the weights very quiet to use, despite any wobbliness.The exercise chart that comes with the set is handy for a basic routine, but some of the exercises will require a bench. Overall, a good value."
4,"Weights work fine, but the packaging was lousy","The weights are fine- easy to use. They do wobble a bit, like other people said, but it's not really an issue for me.The ""poster"" is small and less helpful than most free websites. Like another review said, the styrofoam in the packaging sticks to the coating of the weights and it takes quite a while to clean it off.The weights themselves are fine, though."
3,Buena Compra,"Es un buen reloj por su precio, su disenho es muy bueno y la correa de nylon es la que estaba buscando ya que se adapta bien a la munheca, es funcional para ir a la playa , trotar, nadas etc"
1,Looks great but ...,"The watch itself looks very good, but its functions are not. I expected a sportswatch to be waterproof. But after showering, water had entered the body of the watch. It took days until the water vanished and only then did the watch function again (almost) normally. The backlight does not illuminate the display very well and the alarm is not loud enough and does not wake me.All in all, I cannot recommend buying this watch."
3,"Great watch, bad luck","It's a very nice watch, but the lights did not turn on... You push de booton and nothing happen, It was not good for me because I use to work in night clubs... BAD SELLER"
4,Asche zu Asche,"even though its a new cd, theres no new content on it. if you already own live aus berlin, theres no real need for it. nonetheless, ive got my copy ordered."
3,Asche Zu Asche (Single) Austrailian Tour Promo. 2001,"Asche Zu Asche is a single which was released to promote the 2001 Australian Tour!History is repeating itself in January 2011, exactly on schedule! Australian Tour!Asche Zu Asche is the first song since it is the Asche Zu Asche single! ""Herzeleid""There are then five live songs from Rammstein's live album, ""Live aus Berlin""This is an awesome single but in the end there is not much for it to offer. Repeat.I strongly suggest not to pay over $100.00 for it, it's way to much money!-Trey"
4,Beautiful Natural Sunhat,"Super nice hat. Wish brim was a tiny bit smaller, but is still attractive with nearly everything I have."
1,Defective Bungee Cords,I bought these bungee cords from CML supply. They were correct length and seemed initially perfect for application. They were used under a maximum of 10% length extention and failed. Not just one but all of them failed for no apparent reason other than being defective. Tried in many ways to contact CML supply which they were purchased from and they are completly non responsive. This bungee cord is the worst I have ever seen and would caution anyone from buying it or other items from CML Supply.
4,Great book!,"My only complaint with this book is that I think it would benefit from more pictures. You know, nice, lush details to be studied and learned from."
5,Andrew Wyeth: Memory & Magic,"This makes for a fantastic coffee table book if you are a Wyeth fan. To be blunt the only reason I purchased this book is because my favorite Wyeth works are not commercially available. I would shove my grandmother down a flight of stairs to get my hands on Adrift as it is my favorite Wyeth work. But alas, the book does the trick."
4,A Beautiful and Worthwhile Book,"As a collector of books by and about Andrew Wyeth, I must say this is a tasteful and beautifully produced art book with insightful essays by five excellent writers who know their subject well. Wyeth has been around for a long time and started fading from public consciousness after the ""Helga Affair"" -- undeservedly so. To my mind he is still one of America's greatest 20th century cultural treasures. The book resulted from a retrospective exhibit of Wyeth's work in 2005/2006. My only reservation about the book is that it shows too many of Wyeth's pieces that are in all the other books about his work. But that may be Wyeth's choice and must be respected."
3,Tee Off,This is a alright game to own. I was hoping it would be more like Hot Shots but still a fun game to play. Great game to play with multiple players. I'm not sure if I bought this game bootleg or not because it was in mint condition except there was no original jewel case or booklet that came with it and the game will only load up if I haven't had my Dreamcast running for a few hours. Like most other golf games it is fun to play and has a high replay value in my opinion.
4,I just can't stop playing it!,"OK, by now I see that most of the faults have been addressed on this game. The characters are too-cute, have big heads and say non-sensical things. ""Hee-hee, that's funny""? The world appears as some sort of futuristic Japanese computer/nature nightmare. The golf isn't realistic either. There are no stats to track, no real courses and the music is terrible. So, why can't i pull this game from my Dreamcast? Because underneath all it's faults, it's a nice golf game. And right now, it's the only game in town so I play it. The futuristic croquet game is also a nice touch and is fun to play. If you like golf, by this game. It's simple and basic and fun. You may curse the silly opening sequence and complain about the Japanamerican voice overs but in the end, you will continue to play this game and like it or not...you WILL like it!"
1,Good investment....if you're under 4 years old.,"A complete waste of money. It reminds me of the old Nintendo golf game, but not as fun. People should save their money for the big titles coming out in February like Crazy Taxi and Rainbow Six."
3,teeoff for dreamcast,"As an avid golfer on most gaming systems I found teeoff to be quite enjoyable , especially in [kick back and play golf with your friends] mode. Although I do have a few complaints. Where's the instant replay? Where's the save mode so you can reveiw your favorite shots? Come on now guys who's going to get a high rating with features like them missing? Anyway I've had alot of fun playing this game which I found simular to hotshots golf which was a blast! So I gave it three out of five stars.."
1,Waste of time for a Golfer,"I love golf games. Golden Tee 99 and 2000 are the greatest golf games out today. I think Tee-off may be the worst. If you are over the age of 10 and like to play golf, don't buy this game. If you are prone to dreaming about playing your dreamcast and can't wait to get home to play them, don't buy this game! The people at Dreamcast should have have sent this game out to pasture when the original version was delivered. Do yourself a favor, buy a football or hockey game for now, and wait until Dreamcast puts out a real golf game."
1,Big Disappointment,"Being an avid golfer and a big fan of Tiger Woods for Playstation, I was very excited about a dreamcast golf game. I was very diappointed to see what I had paid for. Animated characters, simplistic game play (way too easy), and just boring in general. Stay away and wait for a real golf game to come out."
1,Tee Off Falls Short of Expectations,Tee Off reminds me of an Atari game in its content and an original Nintendo game with its graphics. I would not recommend this game to anyone. I played for one hour and put the game up for auction on line. It was truly a major dissapointment. You would really expect much more from a Sega Dreamcast game!
2,Looks cheap,"I don't know if the price of this hat is cheap or expensive, because this is the first hat I bought. But I wouldn't recommend it because it looks cheap, the material looks better on the picture. Also, the color is not exactly the one on the picture, is more yellow-ish. So, keep looking and don't waste your money in this hat."
3,Just OK - for Me,"My tastes run different from the arrangements selected, but this might be the perfect album for you. The performances are OK."
5,Good!,"Guided buy their friend Bum, there is another corner at the other side of The Secret Path that is supposed to be fun. Bum is so enthusiastic about the other dimension that Adam and Watch are willing to try. They did not know how dangerous the dimension was. Then, they found a mysterious doorway. at first, they have fun but next, it was now dangerous!"
4,Hypnotic,The remix of Kicking alone is worth the price. It is literally my most listened to track of all time according to my last.fm page. All three tracks are great.
5,Quick and easy,"I have four established fish tanks. I use these strips weekly to make sure my tanks are not having any issues. I've been using these strips for 5 years and work well. Note that they have limited shelf life of about a year. Check the bottom of the container for expiration date. You can tell when they age because the pink test colors are faded. I was surprised to see other reviewers complain that these strips failed to change color. You can test these strips with household products. I also have test tube based kits but these strips have always agreed with the results. I have freshwater tropical fish of the more common variety and they aren't extremely fussy about the pH range or water hardness: cory cats, tetras, loaches, green spotted puffers, guppies, barbs, chocolate gouramis. If you have fish that require very exact water conditions, perhaps strips may not be for you. I find them to be an excellent product and because it's so quick and easy, I actually do test my water weekly."
2,Useless for pH,"I had use the test stripes for a while when trying to increase the pH in my aquarium, but the pH color never really changed. So I got the water tested in a fish store. The result my pH had already increased and was now too high. Useless test stripes! The nitrate and nitrite test seem to work. The other 2 buffer and hardness have never changed so I don't know if they're stable in my tank or if they don't work either. I won't buy this product again."
2,say fresh and salt,said fresh and salt but the strips say fresh and alkalinity is not rite i i ii i i i i i
4,So far so good,This isn't a bad product if you want to get an idea of how your aquarium water is doing.
3,"How it was, not how it is","A lot's changed since 1983 when this book came out, and the forthcoming review of UK sex laws will doubtless change most of the rest.So, unless you're looking for a study of how things used to be, back in 1980s Britain, you need to look elsewhere."
3,"Really, 3-and-a-half, with part 2 being the one to watch","No frills dual-language DVD with NO extras in its menus and a sloppy first chapter. Honestly, I bought it for violent action, and it had that, but the first half was too oblique to be really engaging. The dubbing is surprisingly good, although the sub of course is better, but the violence is imaginative enough to be worth watching a few times. Print quality is OK, doesn't shake, and there's minimal distortion or color bleed. This is definitely a 'boys only' DVD, with big robots punching the guts out of people and big guns blasting at everything in their post-apocalyptic sights. If that appeals to you, buy it! I did..."
2,"Hmm, not that good","MD Geist (Most Dangerous Geist) is a pretty bad anime that, if certain elements were drawn out alot more, wouldn't have been that terrible.However, as it is, the characters are really underdeveloped, there is no plot, and the 80's music combine to make this anime just an over-dramatic, bloodbath anime which makes pretty much no sence at all.However, dispite what I just wrote, I did like the end fight with the robot (? ), and did like all referrences to Geist being ""the devil"". In all, those two aspects are the only things which prevent me from giving it one star."
1,This is the worst anime I've ever seen,"First of all, it's really short, and that irks me. I like my anime to be full length, or it just seems rushed. Second of all, there is no plot in this movie to speak of. People who like it just say, ""oh, it's just nihilistic,"" but in reality there is no point in watching something THIS nihilistic. It's just Geist killing people. There's no conflict, no romance, no opposing forces, just killing people. And on top of everything, the animation isn't even good. All the violence wouldn't be so bad if it was at least drawn well. There was nothing but red smudges through half the film, and a quarter of what was left was just brown smudges for dust clouds. Don't even think of wasting your time, money, or integrity by getting this movie."
2,"Action is great, but there is nothing else good about it.","If your looking for action this is the movie to see, but If you are looking for anything resembling a plot line, likable characters you will be sorely disappointed. The action is great, but every character in the movie is insane, and villanous. Also on a side note, the movie is about killing everything in sight...no heroes, everyone is a villian, and If you want to see this movie, I suggest you borrow it from a friend. It's not worth the money. Action is great, but everything else is sorely disappointing."
1,ultra-violent mindless trash,"Take uninspired voice acting, mix it with less than stellar animation and a nearly non-existent plotline and you end up with a repulsive anime called M.D. Geist. There isn't a character worth giving a care about in the entire movie-- but regardless of that ""little"" flaw, there is enough absurdly violent content to make fans of ""Fist of the North Star"" drool. Pathetically, the sequel is even worse...."
3,Another Cheaply Made Toy from Hasbro- But Very Fun!,"If you are looking for a quality toy- don't buy this one. It is very cheaply made. All of the doors fall off, the hampster tunnel comes apart very easily. If your children are tough on toys or like to play with toys- this one definitely won't last. That said- this toy is very fun. My two girls enjoy playing with the animals. It probaly would have been better if I had just bought the animals. We should demand that these companies produce a product that is worth spending money on. I'm tired of spending money on things that fall apart!!!"
2,Piece of junk,This thing falls apart everytime someone touches it. My kids played with it the night I bought it and haven't picked it up since. My daughters are 8 and 4. What a waste of money. If you have daughters go for the Polly Pocket toys instead.
2,Poorly Produced,"I was hoping that this would be a useful book in helping me to write Perl CGI, but I was not impressed at all. There are numerous errors in the example code that is given - which is frustrating to say the least, but I always got the impression that I was being rushed through everything at super-fast speed without really having anything explained properly. The book ""looks"" nice, and flicking through it quickly one could be forgiven for thinking that it was a reasonable publication, but once one starts to study it then it's easy to see that there are probably far better books. This book might be ok if you just wanted to find out what writing CGI with Perl was all about, but to actually try using it for that purpose would be very testing.My favorite Perl books are the O'Reilly ones, which I'd have no trouble in recommending to anyone."
4,Great Book But Not For Beginners,"The author has an experience with programming. The book is well built for those who already either know a bit about Perl or C++, or have an experience with other languages. The book lacks translations of every line in the code for the beginners. Translations are especially necessary for such a complicated language as Perl. Also the book lacks a CD-ROM.VJT"
3,"""Dim sum?"" Hardly.","From the title of this book one would expect to find real dim sum recipes inside. Instead, most of the recipes are Asian-inspired finger food, which is not at all the same thing. Dim sum is a Chinese food, not a general Asian-ish type of cuisine. To call these recipes ""dim sum"" is almost as inaccurate as calling French hor d'oevres ""dim sum"" simply because they are small, bite-sized treats.I might come across as a bit pedantic here, but this is not simply a matter of semantics. If the author had used a more accurate title such as ""Asian Finger Food"" I would not have lowered my rating by 2 stars. The actual recipes are good and certainly creative, but they do not fit the title of the book.Bottom line: if you are looking for true, traditional dim sum recipes, look elsewhere. There are better books on the topic. If you are thinking of getting this book, know ahead of time what you are getting and you will not be disappointed, because this is a good recipe book."
1,Never received item,BE CAREFUL!! I ordered 3 of these on 11/29/2011. Still haven't received them. They told me they re-shipped them about 3 weeks ago and STILL nothing. Now they are not returning my emails... I'd be leery about ordering anything from them.
5,First Aid Indespensible addition,"If this is needed only once, it will be an invaluable tool for the First Aid kit, paying for itself 10 fold."
5,The real thing,"This is it the, the real thing. Start with the afterword by Zen master, Myotai Treace,it provides a special insight into the poems,the practice and the nature of reality.You might begin with ""Heart"" on page 97 to enter into the depths which beckon."
5,Perfect,This item is just what I was looking. The price was very fair. this item fit the application I need it for.
5,Envelopes,"I mean, they're functional. Nothing wrong with them. If you need envelopes this size, buy these. I did not really read the listing well and inadvertently bought 500. That's my own fault. Regardless, I've learned to use them for all kinds of creative things."
5,nice,"great buy and lasts a long time, better than repeat trips to the store when running low or just plane ran out"
5,Perfect,"I was skeptical because I thought the price was low. But boy, was I surprised. Great product! Great price. This seller is also top notch. I received this product almost immediately after placing order. Highly, highly recommend this product and definitely this seller."
4,Good for the price paid,"These are decent for the price. However, on some of them, the glue on the opened end don't stick strong enough, requiring me to use tape. Other than that one issue, everything is great."
4,Ebco Folding Table Legs,"Legs installed easily and provide solid support. My tables are 96"" x 36"" and are solid when open.Locking mechanism is a little stiff initally, but is managable."
1,very poor quality control,These legs are very poorly made- one could NOT be mounted so it was vertical to the bench top AND folded flat- I had to choose one or the other. Other leg was better but still not able to get completely vertical- the problem- strut was attached 22 cm from top on one leg and 22.5 cm on the other- from the look it should be 21.5 cm for both.DO NOT BUY
2,Quality of product,"Although I was able to make these work, they were of very disappointing quality. I don't thinkthe screws were much more than low-grade aluminum and I doubt I will be able to re-use them should I have to take them out. They were already stripping during installation. There were no directions, so, consequently, I installed the first set of legs backward. For a novice, this is understandable as there is no way to hold onto all four legs and then operate the opening/closing mechanism. Also, I think only one of the four connections to the tabletop was square. They angled, for the most part from toe-in to toe-out. Since these are for an outside table, I am not confident they will last more than two seasons before the legs rust."
1,almost,"This is an almost made it. They are table legs, they fold but they don't do it well or not as well as the price should justify."
5,Fascinating,"Some of the prose is stiff and mannered...no matter. ""The Puppeteers"" is fascinating. Every paragraph is infused with an insider's sense of the recent past, and anyone with a passing interest in foreign affairs will be held captive by the story. Ted Moss is one of those writers that you wish you could corner and question over drinks...easily one of the most authentic spy thrillers I've ever read. I highly recommend this book."
2,Songs tell the story in pleasant romance,"This movie started out good and seemed fun and light but then it just starts becoming unbelievable and kind of stupid when Raj and Simran are supposed to get married but reveal to each other that Raj is in love with Asha and Simran is in love with Sameer who ""coincidently"" happen to be in love with each other. They plot together to ruin Sameer's and Asha's love to get them for themselves with crazy and ridiculous plots that wouldn't work in real life if one had a million dollars. So they ruin the two lives of people just to get with them even though Asha does not love Raj and Sameer does not love Simran. I wont say what happens in the end but I barely made it to end because it just kept getting more and more ridiculous as time went on."
2,Dreaded Dissapointment,I am a huge fan of the Series Of Unfortunate Events & found this book only slightly entertaining. It in no way added anything to the series in any way. If you have read the books & the Unauthorized biography then you have all the info you need to not waste your money on this book. If you have not read the Unathorized Biography I would recomend spending you money on that first!
1,avoid this book at all costs,"This author claims that the Baudelaire children cannot see through Count Olaf's disguises, which is patently absurd, as any reader of the Snicket series would know.She has squandered all her credibility by making this absurd claim, and I would not recommend this book to my dog as a chew toy, let alone to anyone to read.Either she didn't read the books, didn't really absorb what she read, or most likely, merely skimmed the books and paid little attention to them in her haste to capitalize on Snicket's good name.Don't read this book, don't get it from a library, it is a big waste of time."
1,this book is FULL of lies,This book was written by an author who obviously hasn't read A Series of Unfortunate Events. Nothing in this book is true about the series. I highly reccommend you STAY AWAY from this book. PLEASE DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS GARBAGE.
1,what a load of crock,"yeah you herd me, its a load of crock. lemony snicket didnt even write this either, its some idiot that thinks shes him. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!"
2,"Boring and ""so what?""","This book was recommended by a friend who teaches Native American literature. But I found it to be very boring. I do understand its concept of magical realism and the cyclic nature of Native American writers; however, the writing style is weak, and the author is metaphor happy. The metaphors get in the way of a clear reading dragging the reader down. The story is not well told, even allowing for the style of Native American writers. The reader is left saying ""so what?"""
3,I liked it!,This was not a masterpiece of literature - nor was it supposed to be. Take it for what it is - Escape for a few hours. I liked it.
4,Helping my life review,"On the surface this is a very well crafted story about a monk on a spiritual quest.Nothing new here. But as I began to get a few pages into the story I realized that I could relate to so much of what the character Hunglu was feeling that I almost began to feel as if the author had written the book for me alone to read. Every lesson or situation that Hunglu faces we all have faced in some capacity. How he learned and overcame his inner fears is something we all need to learn. This book can and should be read more than once to truly appreciate the lessons it can teach us all. Whether you are a 13th century Taoist monk or a 21st century American, we all need more of the power of love and acceptance in our lives. This book is a good place to start."
2,Siddhartha,"this was an exilerating expierence. Cox liked it very much. Th motions of the characters were lavishing. However, it only gets a two in my book beacause there wasn't enough passion in it."
5,Great refreshing read!!!,The first new author that I truely enjoyed!!! Can't wait for his next book. First 50 pages set the stage but after that I couldn't put it down!
5,Great Summer Reading!,"Suspense, fascinating plot, a thrill a minute. Really enjoyed this chilling tale!"
2,A necessity,"I only buy these because it is a necessity for the greenhouse. They work well, until they lose their elasticity. They seem to lose their elasticity only after one or two growing seasons."
1,First time I've felt the need to review anything,"I have never felt stongly enough about a product to come back and review it, but these were just horrible... I only bought them because I was shopping for ""ok"" speakers and read others' decent reviews. These were laughably bad, they crackle and hum annoying while just sitting there. The sound is distorted and muffled when at a low volume, and crackly, tinny and clipped when playing at anything louder that a whisper. Even if you just want a basic set, spend another $10 and get speakers a step up from these."
4,Good for the office,"Of course, these aren't going to sound like a top-notch stereo system. But they are great for the money, especially if you're like me, and you just want a little background music while you do your paperwork."
3,Good Small Speakers,"These are good small speakers for the price. Would not rock the house, but are great on my desk at work"
5,compact and idiot proof,"we needed new speakers for our computer... don't have a lot of space around the PC and didn't want to spend much money. These compact speakers plugged right in, take very little space and have easy to access volumne control. They are exactly what we needed."
4,They do the job. You get what you pay for,"I didn't expect too much from these, due to the low cost, but they do work. I would have liked them to have a more sensitive input level however, even if the total volume was not increased (they are connected to a device with a low headphone level output, so I have to set the volume to max to get decent sound)."
3,Decent speakers,"For under $10 you could get worse than these - just don't expect a HUGE cound or a LOT of deep bass, OK? they will do fine for small TVs (in a small area), basic computing (email and IM alerts)."
5,Kenny Rogers 42 Ultimate Hits CD,"If you like Kenny Rogers this is the CD for you. A totally fantastic music collection. If you like to save money, do what I did- buy it at Amazon. You will also like the great service."
2,42 ultimate hits,"The very first song ""just dropped in"" quality is very poor. All the other songs on the CD are find."
4,Nostalgic,"I spent a small portion of my childhood living in a suburb of Cairo, Egypt. My family had five audio tapes to listen to, one of which was Kenny Rogers' 20 Greatest Hits. Needless to say, I became quite fond of those songs. Even now, although I disdain country music, prefereing more indie and electronic pop, I will stop and listento Kenny Rogers. This is an excellent collection of the songs I loved as a child and a good introduction to the songs I didn't know at the time and the ones produced since. Everytime I hear ""The Gambler"", ""Lucille"", or ""Coward of the County"", I am taken back to a time when I didn't have a care in the world, where political and economic strife were not issues to me, when I had friends and neighbors or all races and nationalities. The music of this collection take me back. Listen to this collection; it will remind you of the world you though lost forever."
2,BUYER BEWARE,"I had the old 20 greatest hits (1994) cd but it seemed to me that the volume was recorded very low during mastering so i figured that this newly mastered one would be ideal. NOT. The first five tracks are the 'KENNY ROGERS AND THE FIRST EDITION"" versions. If i wanted him and that horrible band he seems to can't let go of, I would have bought that one instead. So you do not get the better ruby don't take your love to town version. You get the old ""kingston trio"" one instead. If you liked the original songs in their original form you'll be dissapointed as some of the old great songs you loved are altered and changed up a bit. CAN SOMEONE PLEASE TELL ME AGAIN WHY THEY FEEL THE NEED TO HAVE TO CHANGE OR ALTER GREATEST HITS PACKAGES. If i had known they were altered and quite horribly i would not have bought this. I would have stuck with the older compilation as it is the better one."
4,"wonderful, but not the original recording of ""The Gambler""?","This is a great collection, but I thought it should be pointed out that ""The Gambler"" recording here isn't the same as from the 1978 album The Gambler. Don't know when this one was recorded, but it's pretty close to the original."
5,KENNY ROGERS,"IT'S KENNY ROGERS, NOTHING MORE SHOULD NEED TO BE SAID. HE HASN'T BEEN SUCCESSFULE FOR 50 SOMETHING YEARS FOR NO REASON."
5,Ultimate,A little of everything from him. From Big Brother and the Holding Company to the duets to his solos. A little of everything is here.
1,42 Ultimate Hits Kenny Rogers,"This came up in a search for CDG's and I was very excited since I'd love all these Kenny Rogers songs for my karaoke collection. It is NOT a CDG, just a regular music CD and therefore a big disappointment to me. Either Amazon needs to be a little more careful about honoring the SEARCH commands or whoever is advertising their stuff needs to be careful of false advertising. The difference in this case is critical and I'm now afraid to buy any more discs from Amazon."
1,Kenny Rogers Blechhhhh!,"I really like ""the Gambler"", so I decided to download this 42 hit collection. Thank goodness I didn't pay for it.My conclusion: Kenny Rogers music is trash!Having listened to his other hits on the CD I'm completely dissastisfied. To make a long review short, Kenny's hits constitute sensual love songs. Unlike ""the gambler"" every song is devoid of clever lyrics.I felt my self becoming more stupid just by listening to this 2 CD set.I really tried folks! I really tried to enjoy Kenny's music. I thought I'd give it some time to appreciate it. Nope! Plain and simple, Kenny Rogers is easy-listening sensual love-dovey barf.Kenny sounds great playing softly in your doctor's office; thats about it.How many greatest hits has Kenny put out now? It certainly must exceed the number of almums he recorded.Did KR get plastic surgery? His eyes look different now."
5,Kenny Rogers pitches a winner,"If you're completing your music collection and haven't a Kenny Rogers CD, get this one. All hits ranging from beginning to now."
5,The Best,We love listening to Kenny Rodgers and this CD is exceptional. I play this CD often. Kenny's songs never fail to stir emotions or bring to mind that someone special.
4,A Kenny Fan must have,"This is a nicely packaged 2-disc set. The Kenny classics are on there, good selection and a definite must have if you're a Kenny Fan."
5,Excellent Rat Home!,"I have two male rats and they love this cage. It is reasonably easy to put together and very easy to clean. Though it is quite spacey, I wouldn't suggest keeping more than two rats in it. The deep plastic tub at the bottom keeps a lot of the bedding in the cage that is thrown around when they burrow and play. I have had the cage for two months and there has been no sign of escaping. I would highly recommend this habitat."
2,Not for a Houdini rat,"I bought this cage after reading all of the reviews about how wonderful it was. It was relatively easy to assemble and my rats did have a good time climbing all over it. But when one of them got out in the middle of the night, I knew instantly I was returning it. The wire is easily bent and not very durable. Perhaps if my rats were fatter and bigger this would have worked."
2,"Only suitable for 2 female rats, not okay for males or 3 rats...","Rats need a recommended 2.0 cubic feet per rat. They also should never be kept in solitude, you need to have at least a pair-- this cage meets that requirement at 4.0 cubic feet. For males, however, 2.5 cubic feet is suggested, meaning you'd need 5 cubic feet per pair (again, they are social animals which require a same-sex cage mate to be healthy) & this cage would not adequately house them. So, if you have two females & never plan to house males or get a third, this is okay. It would be suitable as a cage for quarentine or breeding purposes, but not an adequate living space."
2,Not Safe...,"I had a cage from this same brand, and it was exactly the same as this one, except for the white ramps. I believe this is the updated version of it.My experiences of this cage have not been pleasant. The wheel is NOT SILENT, no matter what the box says. It's the LOUDEST hamster wheel that I've ever seen/heard. You will definitely need to replace it. And, it's not really big enough for hamsters/rats/mice. I got this cage for my first Roborovski hamster, and he escaped. The top comes off easily. My brother recenly got a mouse and we housed him in this cage for a week or two (promptly getting another cage). The mouse escaped from it, as whenever he climbed up the side of the cage (as all small rodents do), the door easily swings open allowing the mouse to escape. We had to twisty-tie the doors and the cage to the tub, and we also had to Velcro the cage to the dresser-top.Over-all, my experience is not good, and I'd reccommend going with a tank."
3,dwarf hamsters can escape!,"I'm having my first experience with dwarf hamsters so I am new to them and to this brand of cage. The dwarf hamsters easily escape. Since I also have cats there were casualties within the first 24 hrs. Not fun! Other than that I like the cage, particularly the size. I don't like keeping small pets in cages the size of shoe boxes. So I've had to move the hamsters temporarily until I find something else I like. On the other hand, at the same time I bought this cage I bought the next larger version and have gerbils in it. I'm very pleased with that so far. No escapes and lots of space. So five stars for gerbils, one star for dwarf hamsters."
4,Teal Cage For Your New (or Old) Friend,"When I still had this cage, I cannot deny that I did like it. It was very easy to clean, had a nice deep basin like it says in the description, and the wheel that came with it was rather quiet. The only reason I didn't give it a five was due to the fact that said quiet wheel was obnoxiously ginormous, meaning that my rats at the time preferred using it as a place to store things and sleep rather than a source of exercise. Also, the way that they show the one ramp being used below the hole in the shelf is not applicable if you want it anything less steep than a forty-five degree angle. Like I said, I did enjoy the cage, so overall, yes it is worth the money, I just had a few discrepancies with it."
4,Fun Collection for Everday,"This is exactly what it appears to be- a collection of some of the best strips on a day-to-day calendar. Nothing new. However the old stuff doesn't get old. I work with adolescent boys. Jerry Scott has got it down- the challenges, joys, angst and goofy-ness of being a 15 year old male. Nice work. If you are a fan, get this."
4,Hockney's art through Hockney's eyes,"This book is a very complete compendium of David Hockney's output up to 2004. Its main asset is the quality of the illustrations, some of which are accompanied by a short commentary by the artist. Divided into four chapters ( chapter 1, entitled ""problems of depiction"", deals with the artist's various series on theater stages, water, movement, how to adapt to a moving viewpoint, the problem of styles, etc; chapter 2 entitled ""life stilled"", dwells on home, life, still life, love; chapter 3 tackles portraits; chapter 4 studies space and light) it has very little text and leaves it to the reader, or rather, to the spectator to interpret all the works (which, in my opinion, is not a bad idea for an art book).Probably the best available on this major artist."
2,"He's a shredder, not a teacher","Alexi is a great guitar player but he wouldn't have a clue how to teach you to replicate any of what he does. He shows you the notes he plays, then plays them himself at full speed ... nothing you couldn't get from a Guitar Pro file! Plus he seems grumpy as all heck in this video, so it isn't even pleasant to watch him talking about what he's doing. Wouldn't buy it again if I had the chance."
5,Information please?,Could someone tell me what the songs are on this DVD. I'd really like to buy it but I need track listings first. Thanks.
4,Prepare Yourself!,Quite an interesting documentary. Very well told and easily understandable even if you do not know much about the subject. Especially when you've just visit Rome (or planning on doing so) it's highly recommended.It's is a nice prelude to the next year to be released film Angels & Demons directed by Ron Howard based on the book Angels & Demons by Dan Brown to which is been revered to quite often in this documentary.Money well spend.
4,A magnificent History lesson for all.....,"Spiritual Shackles, is a magnificent history lesson in itself. It reveals how different religious beliefs of others are often challenged by how others believe or except them. The characters encourage your reading journey in this novel.Much Respect, Linda Washington-Johnson,Jackson Mississippi Readers Club Reviewer"
5,AMAZING MOVIE WITH REAL CRASH VIDEO,"This movie was made for TV and again, it proves that Hollywood could learn a lesson from the small movie makers. This movie blew me away! Okay, so it's not an award winning cast but if you forget ""John Boy"" is in charge and Charlton Heston's presence is a bit large for a TV movie, this story is one you won't forget. And no matter how many times I see the actual crash footage inserted into this movie, I'm still amazed.And here we are again. Where is the DVD format? There isn't one because this is yet another great movie the execs thought no one would like. If a ""bootleg"" copy comes along, I'll buy it. I'm tired of waiting for brainless executives to get their heads out of their a-- and put the better movies on DVD!"
4,High Quality Results Without the High Price,"Overall, I am very pleased with this product. It definitely appears to be improving the fine lines around my eyes, absorbs quickly, and doesn't irritate my sensitive skin. Great product for such a reasonable price...it's a staple now in my daily beauty regimen!"
3,Ehhh...,"If you owned the original Jetfire that was released in the 80's, and were expecting an all metal version of that classic Macross based design, you will be sorely disappointed. The transformation of the figure differs significantly from the original, enough to make one question the name on the box. Whereas the original allowed me to play Transformers or Macross, this new figure just annoys me.Calling it a metal Transformer is also inaccurate - like calling a car an all metal product would be inaccurate. There are metal parts, but most of the figure is still plastic - not unlike the first generation Optimus Prime from the 80's.That said, the quality of the figure is still good. It's a pain to transform, and not nearly as high quality as the name suggests, but it isn't horrible. If you're looking for nostalgia from your youth, look elsewhere... if you're looking for a toy for your grandkid, you could do worse."
2,disapointed,"I was very disapointed with the size of this toy and the price it cost. I evidently didn't see the 6"" when i ordered it, because I would have never purchased it."
2,Only for Certain Parents,"This book appeals to a specific audience: Well-educated, upper middle class parents with a solid relationship with the teen and involvement with high school life and the college application process, and no serious domestic unresolved issues. Its major virtue is to tell obsessive parents to let their burgeoning adults take more control of their lives than they are willing to grant. For the parents of a teen with unresolved issues, or one with a clear idea of how to handle college admissions and their lives in general, the book is silent. The major point is: Back off, parents. If you are not a parent who needs this message of allowing kids to find their own path, you may find it without much utility."
5,A composer's unique approach to Sibelius,"Although cogently written, the three-star review here is far off the mark. Woolly? Slow? Lacking in vitality? Segerstam rarely, if ever, displays those flaws. Being a composr himself, his highly personal approach is full of intensity and vitality. Ondine's recorded sound is crystal clear, and the Helsinki orchestra plays incisively. I think this Sibelius cycle, which sells cheaply at Amazon Marketplace, is a real sleeper, and anyone who loves these symphonies will be excited by what Segerstam does with them -- his way is unique.Since I've reviewed quite a few of the performances individually, I won't repeat myself here, except to say that my recent discovery of this conductor has added new enthusiasm to my appreciation of Sibelius. To prefer second-rate accounts by Collins and Maazel makes little sense to me, even if we are talking about personal taste."
2,Learn Spanish in Your Car,"I have the audio cassette version of this course. I enjoy the way that it approaches teaching Spanish by building on words that you already know. I like the way that one is able to answer once and repeat twice after the native speaker replies in Spanish. I would give this course a much higher rating if it only gave you more time to reply. If you have to think at all to translate, then the native speaker is already giving the answer. Often there isn't enough time to repeat what the native speaker says afterwards if you knew perfectly what to say or simple said it back in English. I had a Spanish speaking friend try it and he couldn't reply in time. The pauses aren't long enough.If one wanted to learn at home where a pause button is an option, then this woud be an excellent course. In the car, however, where a pause button is not an option, it doesn't work that well and is frustrating."
3,Good Start,The beginning tapes were great to help me regain the years of spanish that I took in high school and college. The later tapes went so fast and were fairly complex that I just gave up.
1,1 and done,I had this product for approx 1 year+ and now it is dead. The cost to ship it back for repair is expensive because of the weight.
4,great teaching tool,We really liked this DVD. It has great lessons to help you teach your child how to swim. My son watched this with us and he used the ideas and began swimming this summer. I began using these techniques on our baby and she loves the water and does not mind the occasional dunk - with the DVDs described warning.
4,Wonderful 2nd installment,"It's surprising that Denise Mina is not better known in this country. Her current series, culminating in SLIP OF THE KNIFE recently released, is receiving a lot of attention, but her first series starting with GARNET HILL, is just as compelling and well plotted. Her description of the main character's dysfunctional family is not as clear cut as in the first volume, but is present nonetheless. This is the middle volume of the series, and has a plot line and resolution that the reader will not see coming. Highly recommended."
4,"Read GARNETHILL first, you'll be glad you did","I recommend for anybody to read GARNETHILL first before starting EXILE. In Denise Mina's latest novel she recaps the sequences of her previous novel and reveals who the killer was in that book. Some questions that I had from GARNETHILL were explained here.In this latest work, Maureen is working for a woman's shelter and trying to gain control of her life. She investigates the death of Ann Harris, a former client from the Scottish center, who was found beaten to death in London. As in most mystery books, things are not quite what they seem and Maureen is way over her head.I enjoyed this book, learning a bit about domestic abuse and women's shelters. Mina has a way with words while describing characters and locations. I only suggest to anyone who is unfamiliar with Mina's work to start with GARNETHILL before beginning EXILE. You will feel richer for it."
5,A little bit helps,"Mom is 83 years old and has a large bald spot in the middle of her head. This product has been helping her healthy hair grow; however, the spot remains."
3,Too soon to know,"So far, nothing to report. My understanding is that it takes a couple of months before growth will appear. Ask again in a few months. I'm not giving up yet!"
5,Rogaine,"It works, I wished it was not quite that expensive. I will continue using it. I do not find it dangerous to have skin contactwith Rogaine, it washes off easily."
4,Rogaine for Women,"This product works very well at stopping hair loss, and does minimally enhance new growth. Because it's colorless and fragrance free, it's less likely to discolor hair."
1,Caused scary Hair Loss for me,"Let me say right off the bat that I only used this product for a month before discontinuing. The reason I discontinued use was because way too much hair (and I didn't have much to begin with) was falling out in clumps! My dermatologist recommended Rogaine for women because my hair had been thinning over the last year, and she thought the product might help me regrow some hair. She mentioned to me that initially some extra hair would fall out but after a month of steady use, just too much was falling out and I can't afford to lose anymore hair! I guess it works for many women, and if you are one of these women, consider yourself lucky. While I know products for hair regrowth can take months to work, I feel frustrated that I wasn't able to give this product a real chance to be effective. Maybe if I had kept using it, I would have been able to grow a bunch of new hair, but I wasn't willing to take the risk of serious hair loss!"
1,They do not accept return even the unopened boxes,"We ordered 2 boxes of Rogaine (total of 6 bottles). My mum started using Rogaine as instructed. A week later she started getting allergic reactions like rashes on her head and on her forehead, unbearable itching on her head, flaking of scalp and terrible hair fall etc. First we thought it was due to some food she ate but these symptoms started to disappear when she stopped using Rogaine. We called Rogaine and expalined the situation but neither Rogaine nor Amazon accepted to get the unopened bottles and boxes back. Therefore do not order large amounts before trying it with a small bottle."
4,IT WORKS BUT IT TAKES TIME,"i USED ROGAIN AND IT'S BEEN HELPING ME SLOWLY SO YOU NEED TO BE PATIENT AND CONSISTENT, USE IT TWICE A DAY, I HAVE HORMONAL HAIR LOSS AND IT HAS BEEN GREAT, ALSO FOR MY EYEBROWS."
3,Rogaine for Women,"Great delivery, takes up to 4 months to work if it is going to. I am in my second month, nothing yet. Leaves roots a bit oily, but if it actually works, I can live with that."
3,Still Hopeful,I have only used Rogaine hair growth for one month. Not enough time to really tell a difference. It takes away the natural feel of my hair and makes it feel very harsh and dry but I have not given up on it until I use it for at least 3 months. No noticeable change other than the way it makes my hair feel.
1,waiting for lush hair?,I HAVE BEEN USING ROGAIN FOR FOUR MONTHS. HAVE NOT SEEN ANY NEW HAIR. WILL GIVE IT ONE MORE MONTH. IF NOTHING HAPPENS I WILL STOP USING IT.
1,Rogaine for women,My wife has been using this product for 2 months and we haven't seen any hair growth. This product does not work. Do not buy this product.
5,It works,"I have been using this for a little over 2 months now and have really started to see a difference. I was losing hair fast after going onto new medication, but Rogaine has not just halted the loss, it is getting my hair back."
4,Too early to see results,"This is my 4th month of using this treatment. I still can't tell if there has been any improvement. I will continue to use it because I know regrowing hair cannot happen over night. It does seem thicker in the area where I am applying the treatment but I can't see the growth and don't know how it will appear. I keep looking for some fuzzy growth but don't see it, although it does feel like that--I do see some short hairs (my hair is long and does grow very fast) and wonder if the new growth is already there and beginning to blend--only time and a lot of patience will tell. My hair dresser said I would be surprised at the number of women who use the treatment--it is not something women are willing to discuss with other women."
4,It works!,"I used this product over the last year after head laceration. My hair was slow to regrow but then I started using this product and within a month I started to get fuzz, then real hair. (hair grows in stages so you need to be patient.) It's liquidy and spills easily out of the dropper, so I just wish it were easier to apply. But no side effects for me otherwise. No redness or burning. Very pleased. I'm continuing to use it until my hair is grown back."
5,Rogaine for women,"Bought it for my aunt, she has been using this for a while now, she claimed that it work very well. This is a great price compare to outside source."
5,ROGAINE FOR WOMEN,This transaction was very satisfactory. The product is very good! The product does work in keeping hair loss for women at bay.
5,Best book on the subject,"""Thinking Like Your Editor"" is one of the very best book for writers, up there with Strunk & White. The book not only explains how to get your own book published; it's a gold mine of advice on writing itself, and its authors' class shines through every line."
4,Insightful Info for Writers,"There are some terrific tips and insider information in this book. I am a ghostwriter and try to help some of my authors decide what direction to go with their ideas. Susan's advice was a winner. She is very frank and freely shares her opinion, which is usually right on. I would recommend this book to any would be writer who is looking for direction and insight into your career."
4,Fiction or nonfiction.,"Actually, there were some good advice in this book. I'm not a nonfiction writer, but if I were to change over; the advice would be there for me to view and study. I kinda think this book is for all writers and writers alike. True it's a little boring to read, but it's the facts to take into consideration. When you are a serious Writer, all information is essential. So, I recommend this book for all new and old writers; regardless to what you write."
2,An absolute shame for its publisher,"This book provides useful advice in its first 125 or so pages. Then it starts going into material that is rehashed in virtually every book on publishing your manuscript. But what is terrible about a book on ""Thinking like your editor"" is the number of misprints and poor typesetting that occurs throughout the book. Did Rabiner and Fortunato ever read the proofs? Did they ever talk to their editor? And why did Norton publish a book with such egregious errors; does it have no care for its reputation?"
3,Where is the sample Table of Contents?,"Where is the sample Table of Contents????Overall a very helpful book...HOWEVER, the so-called sample proposal for a book titled Breech of Faith located in the Appendix section is incomplete. Whwere is the Table of Contents section?As a super visual person, I NEED that section to see how it's organized. I just don't get whythe author did not include this section.Or is it hidden somewhere? Anyone know?"
5,Thinking Like Your Editor,"A great review before every submission. If content is good, should push one to the front of the line."
1,Now Completely Outdated,"While the basic information the history of blogging is obviously still true, the examples about using blogs as a method of viral marketing are now very outdated. As far as I can see, this has now been replaced by Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest and a host of other social networking sites. None of these even rate a mention in Blog Wild!, probably because this was published in 2006 and hasn't been updated since. The world has moved on, but Blog Wild! hasn't.The other fault is that all the instruction is given for TypePad (because that's the platform the author uses and prefers), where I see Blogger and WordPress being used by more people these days."
3,A Very Good Beginner's Book On Blogging... That's If You Plan To Use TypePad,"The author does a fine job of giving the novice exactly what they need to get their very own blog up and going immediately. The book is a quick read and serves more as a ""how to"" guide for the popular blogging software TypePad. If that's what you're looking for, then this book's a good choice."
5,Easy Introduction to Blogging,"Andy Wibbels provides a easy, quick-to-read introduction to the world of blogging. This is probably the first book one should read to obtain a foundation in blogging, then move on to other books that provide greater depth and case examples."
3,Pros and Cons,"Pros:1. Clearly written in an engaging style.2. Easy to read and not overly technical. He does a good job of explaining fairly complex things like RSS feeds so beginners can understand.3. A few very good pieces of blogging advice and some interesting blog citations.Cons:1. The bulk of the text is a ""how-to"" manual for TypePad. If you don't use that platform, well over half the book will be barely relevant.2. No screen shots. When you're explaining, for instance, step-by-step posting mechanics, screen shots clear up a lot of confusion.3. Although the book sings the praises of business blogging, I don't think it provides enough depth to get company leadership behind it. More detailed case studies might have helped."
3,Precision Bluing's Wild Review!,"While this book was well written and very clear, it perhaps should have been titled ""Typepad 101"". I had purchased this to learn how to better use our business's blog ""Journal Entries of an Online Entrepreneur"" on Wordpress, but was able to apply very little of the information in this book to our own blog.I'm not saying you shouldn't purchase this book, but I am saying that you should only purchase it if you are interested in learning how to use Typepad because that is the only platform taught~Jennifer SmithPrecision Bluing"
5,An hour to read - 10 Minutes to a new blog,"This is my kind of tech book: fast, easy, helpful, and, well, not very technical. It's a quick read -- a fast overview of blogs and the author's favorite way to create and maintain one. The book took an hour to read, and my first blog took all of about 10 minutes to set up following his advice.Well done!"
4,Plush Opossum,This opossum was purchased as a gag gift for a friend who lives out of the city limits and had a run-in with a opossum. Got lots of laughs
4,Great deal if you want a stuffed opossum for a gag gift,"Bought this as a joke for a relative who had a run-in with a real possum. For the price, it is a great deal and pretty high quality, even cute. The gift recipients had a great laugh about it."
1,DOA,"Wow what a stinker, Can't believe Maxtor made this one. I know bad drives tend to slip through the cracks, I just happened to get one. What puzzles me is tech support didn't have a clue. The drive never worked. I wasted 2 hours and ended up taking it back for a refund. This 3100 model had 250GB of storage. I should have known something was funny when I saw a huge pile of them at the electronics store. Maxtor makes pretty good internal drives but their external ones are awful."
1,my 1st HD.,"... i'm not sure about the clicking noises, but HD has annoying hum. it's so annoying that i'm seriously thinking about spending money on another HD. not that i need more space, but i need more silence. i've had this HD for a week. hopefully it doesn't die before i get another HD."
4,Gadon's Once and Future Godddss,This is a complete and thorough depiction of the beginnings of Goddess Culture and where the world has gone since: through patriarchy and now the feminist movement. Great pictures !
5,Very helpful book.,"I, too, was very fortunate in having Jerri as my nurse when I had my son 11 years ago. She was the reason I didn't give up on nursing my son. I told her this when I saw her in a restaurant one day--remember Jerri! I'm so glad you got to write your book. You did a fantastic job. This woman knows her stuff!"
