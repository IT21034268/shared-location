1,"Cliched, derivative, passable","Eragon is a fantasy novel written by Christopher Paolini. He started when he was fifteen, and finished when he was nineteen, which is truly a noteworthy accomplishment. This book has been hailed as a phenomenon, and has become an international bestseller. But honestly, I wrack my brain trying to understand how and why. For those who have read and love Eragon, I hope you become exposed to real fantasy and science fiction soon. For those of you who haven't read this, let me make a suggestion: read Lord of the Rings, and watch the original Star Wars trilogy. You'll know all you need to know about Eragon, and you'll save your money."
1,"An awful, awful book","This is probably the worst book I have ever read. It left me lukewarm towards the characters, not really caring whether they lived or died. The plot was slow and predictable, with parts taken almost directly from other popular pieces of liturature. The writing was atrocious. I could not even finish this book, that's how bad it was. I can not imagine why anyone would like this. Sorely disapointed."
3,Okay but immature writing,"The bottom line is that this book was written by a fifteen-year-old and has the immature style that is to be expected from someone so young. The book has potential, but there are all those niggling details to take care of. I see that it was published by his parent's publishing company, which explains a lot. I don't think a major publishing house would have touched it without major editing. It is way to early to be comparing this kid to Tolkien, Eddings, or Jordan, but I think Paolini has promise and I look forward to what he will be writing in the future as his style matures."
2,Needs works,"I picked up this book based on some of the hype generated around Paolini. While I have to agree with some of the other reviews regarding the writing style and the portions of the story which are influenced from some very geat Authors. Even though Paolini has taken plot lines from other Authors I will wait to see where these stories end up. I don't want to trash his first effort completely and look forward to seeing what the next volume has in store. Hopefully, the editing issues can be resolved by then."
3,Not Very Original,"I first bought this book when all the hype started about its young author self-publishing his first book while still a teenager. I didn't like it; in fact, I never finished the novel and gave to a friend -- who also didn't particularly like the novel, but finished it anyway. First, it was very poorly written. You can tell a teenager with little life experience wrote the novel. Second, The dialogue is stilted and immature at the same time. Third, The characters are very two dimensional, and there is nothing original in this novel. The writers pulls from many sources: Tolkien (of course, who doesn't), Robert Jordan, Anne McCaffrey, and Terry Brooks among them. So why did I come back to it and give the story 3 stars? I enjoyed the audio version. Gerard Doyle rises above some of the bad dialogue and gives each character a voice of his or her own; and by the end of the story I find myself interested enough to listen to the next novel, again read by Gerard Doyle."
4,A great book to read with my boys.,"I enjoyed reading Eragon. Now I am reading it to my 3 boys. I was constantly amazed that it was written by someone who was so young. I was captivated by each page and I could not wait to find out what happened next. My boys love sword fighting, dragons, magic and heros and they love Eragon. We are looking forward to the next book.Larna"
1,"Um actually, Eng's right","Eragon does suck and Dragons: Lexicon Triumvirate is much better. Had any of you actually read both books, you would see what I mean. Hell, why even read them? I'm 10 and just by looking at the concepts, I can tell that Eng beats Paolini."
1,Ewww I dont even have to read it,"I wish he came up with better ideas, too much like Lord of the Rings and Star Wars. I understand taking elements, but taking the same entire story is pretty terrible and another thing. This book is like taking a paper bag, and turning it inside out, it appears different, still a paperbag, but what they have in common is that you can wipe your ass with them. :-)"
2,Not memorable for many adult readers,"Christopher Paolini did an amazing job to write this book at the age of 17. However, the imagination and originality of Eragon is lacking. It seems as if the plot is derived from a mixture of a number of past fantasy novels. Overall, the plot contains trite ideas and themes. Character development, and especially emotional development, are areas that are weak. It is a fairly good book, especially for younger readers, but there is not much substance and originality to make it memorable for older readers."
2,Agreeing with B. Capossere's review ...,"I agree with B. Capossere's lengthy and thoughtful review. This was a 17-year-old fantasy book written by a 17-year-old. My 12-year-old son loved it, and that is to be expected. But where was Paolini's editor? For my part, I felt like the work jerked me back-and-forth, as the author would run deep for a bit, then shallow, then back and forth. While I enjoyed the story as a reflection -- as Capossere points out -- of greater fantasy writers, with some tighter editing, this could have been even better.Still, hurrah for Paolini for self-publishing and believing in his work enough to see it through! I'll look forward to reading his works in 10 years or so ...."
2,hard to understand,"I'm a very good reader. I read the fifth Harry Potter book in two days (like 900+ pages). This book took me about a month to read B/C it had a lot of unnecessary detail and probably could have been written much better in about 300 pages. I'm not surprised that lots of other kids like this book, it was sorta fun and exciting (key word: sorta). The other main reason I didn't enjoy this book was because so much of it was copied from LOTR, which I read also. I don't think Christopher Paolini meant to copy certain parts of the book, but that's not really much of an excuse. There's too much plagarism for it to have been ""Subconsious""DON'T READ UNLESS YOU'RE A FANTASY FANATIC AND DON'T CARE ABOUT PLAGARISM OR ARE LESS THAN 13 YEARS OLD!!!!!!!"
2,Not too great,"this book is a major acomplishment for a 15-16 year old, but so much stuff is ripped off of LOTR. It's really predictable and you can see what will happen chapters early if you are 13+ years old. what really bugs me is that Paolini describes EVERY SINGLE THING in the book. i mean, do we really NEED to know what all the unimportant characters look like with so much choppy detail??? also, sometimes the characters speak like it's Middle Earth, and sometimes they speak like it's Today."
1,"Ah, youth.","Amazing? The best book ever? Incredibble [sic] writing? Ahhh...to be young and stupid again! These youngsters will probably be ashamed to remember their bright-eyed, glowing praise for what is not even a sub-par fantasy knockoff when they get older and discover real fantasy. I read this to my kid. I was ashamed to have finished the book, even in that capacity. He lost interest about 1/2 way through--I lost it much earlier. I guess you can't blame the kids for their poor taste. I listened to the Monkees when I was younger ;-) Consider ""Eragon"" the Monkees of fantasy novels....it looks pretty but their isn't much there when you actually stop and pay attention to it."
2,"not bad, not great","Alas, having been steeped in Tolkien and CS Lewis, I have extremely high standards. This book is not bad, and kudos for the author being so young, but I was not personally thrilled. I shall read the sequel but I went ahead and gave ""Eregon"" away."
3,Names and Events,"I have this book and while it is a good read I have to agree with B. Capossere's review of the book. While reading this book, I also saw the comparisons with Star Wars and the Lord of the Rings. For example, take the title of the book, ERAGON. If you've read the Lord of the Rings or seen the movie, you can definitely see the link to Tolkien. As for the Star Wars link, that goes into more of the plot of the book but again, it is defnitely apparent. I also saw a link to Dungeons and Dragons while reading. The story is different but the names are taken on the basis of other works and I think that even for a 17 year old, there should be more imagination in the world created. Would the story have lost it's appeal if different names were used? I don't think so. But it is a let down in the imagination aspect when similar names and events are used because your mind automatically goes to the other stories."
2,To put it more succinctly.....,"There is nothing innovative in this book. What was innovative of Tolkien, LeGuin, and Mcaffrey has been regurgitated in Eragon. It is remarkably well done for a teenager's mimicry of greater works, but will remain just that. Mimicry. Two stars instead of one because it was readable."
1,does NOT own his own company!,"Look, I don't really like Eragon, but I would like to clear some thing up. A lot of reviewers have dissed Paolini becuase supposedly his parents ""owned their own publishing company."" Well that is FALSE. His parents self published some books of their own, and they helped him self publish Eragon, but the key here is SELF-PUBLISHED. While I don't personally like the book (too cliche for me) I have to give him a hand for how he marketed it. Paolini did it the good old American way by publishing the book himself and then fighting tooth and nail to get people to buy it, by traveling the country, giving his own lectures in libraries and schools, and trying to sell it himself in bookstores. To make a long story short, he worked hard to get Eragon picked up by a traditional publishing company, so whether you liked the book or not, stop giving him a hard time for something that is not accurate."
1,"Am I expecting too much? Nope, not at all","Cliche, ripoff, no use of the word said, it's all been said why this book is crap.All right, there's lots of cliched pulp fantasy out there, but at least these mediocre books accept what they are. If you'll check out Paolini's website, you'll see the arrogance he's developed from writing a mediocre pulp fantasy book that thinks it's going to be a classic."
4,Promising but an amalgamation of cliche.,"Hmmm. I liked this series. It is good, well written which is a surprise because paolini was 16 when he wrote eragon. There is a good plot, mysterious characters, questionable allies, horrifiying enemies, elves, dwarves and ... dragons.which basically meanis that paolini hit every cliche in the fantast genre.Not only that but the gedwey ignasia ( is that how it is written) is reminiscent of Edding's Garion and the white mark on his palm. The dragon is reminiscent of the dragons of McCaffrey's Pern. Even the jokes in later books(though subtle) are sometimes reminiscent of Eddings.not one original thought. (again not surprising - remember sixteen). Still, the plot is promising and I hope that Paolini develop his story better. As a matter I have just read the second book and I know for a fact that the story does develop more maturely.Way to go Christopher."
3,tipos,save your money and buy a paperback c op y that isn't full oft ypos ]:=$ wow. do somethingabowt it
5,Duncan,Anyone who dosen't like Eragon has a bad taste for books. The best book in the world is this book. The first thing I couldn't belive was it was writen by a seventeen year old!
5,Good,This book is really good. I like it alot and I don't get why everyone else doesn't. I say read this book and don't listen to the other people.
4,young author writes great story,"If you love McCaffery's Pern books then you will probably enjoy this series too (2nd book is out already). Author wrote this book at 15, second at 19, can't wait for next book to come out."
5,Awesome read,"This was a really great book. It shouldn't matter how old the author was when it was written. All that matters is that is was a good book, and the rest of the series is as well."
5,Audio Book purchase - Eragon,The book is excellent. We live way out of town and it's nice to have something like this. It stirs the imagination of my children and shows them that books can be exciting. The service I receive through Amazon.com has always been excellent.
2,Ergaon...uh oh,"Christoper Paolini graduated from high school at the age of 15 and in my opinion he should have waited a good deal longer to write Eragon. See, Eragon is not that bad of a idea just poorly executed. The writing falls flat on all facets and in my opinion cant compete with the likes of Robert Jordan, CS Lewis, and even JK Rowling. Considering how many people dislike his book I would not be suprised to find his next book, Eldest to be a real jaw dropper. Critiscm only makes you stronger and Paolini is gonna need alot of it to succeed in this biz. All told Eragon is Poor, unorginal with flat bordering on boring writing. If your new to the genre or 14 and younger I could reccomend it (but I wont). Bottom Line: Wait and see how Eldest is before you try Eragon."
3,"Good, but...","It started off well, but the ending took a bit longer to get to than I expected. There was great tension building up until the last 1/4 of the book and than when the final conflict came I thought ""Finally! We've reached the end!"" Still, I though the book was well done, with a good history, backstory, mystery, and adventure all rolled into one. I'm expecting the next book, Eldest, will have all the good points of the first, with none of the flaws of the first."
2,Cliche,"The plot of this book is the classic coming-of-age story (with dragons, albeit) that one sees in works such as Harry Potter and Star Wars. You can basically cross out the character names from synopses of those and replace them with the character names from Eragon. The story line is classic, but this book doesn't even bring any interesting twists to it.The characters are archetypes, with no personality quirks that would have made them actually interesting.If the author was given an assignment to write a book based on this classic story type, this would have been an admirable response. As it is, it's mind-numbingly boring. It's amazing for a book written by a fifteen-year-old, but it's still not very interesting."
2,Long winded any one,"When I was a little kid, I started and read this book, and I found it quite good, then I read decent fantasy novels. This book is so immensity long winded that if you cut it down to important details, it would have been maybe thirty pages. In addition to having a paper thin plot that anyone could guess the ""twists"" the author blatantly rips off other authors and works as opposed to creating his own ideas. The ancient language is Latin and dwarves speak german! Urgales are simply orcs. All of the characters are shallow and make nothing but one terrible decision after another. Also, the magic users in this book are super weak and whinny ""oh, I can't heal him easily, it a paper cut, better draw on my magic reserves!"" seriously, this book is nearly as bad as Harry Potter. Don't waste your time on this book if you can read above a third grade level."
3,Good book but,"I liked this book a lot, it really managed to get me hooked. Of course, sometimes you'll get a little deja vu and think, ""I've seen this before"". Yes, many parts in the book seem to resemble Star Wars and LOTR."
2,Disappointing,"I purchased this relatively unknown book due, in part, to the positive reviews on Amazon. I was misled. As an avid reader, this book was underdeveloped and poorly written. The numerous typos are distracting and the characters lack depth. I forced myself to read the book, hoping it would improve but it did not. Save your money do not buy this book."
1,Not another one (groan),"Not another ""this is a children's book, so don't criticize it"" reviewer. Wendelin Van Fan, here's some stuff for you.Wendelin said that criticizing Eragon is like ""13 year olds criticizing Berenstein Bears."" First off, how do you know the ages of the reviewers? Many of them are in fact ""young adults"". I'm sixteen and I know a crappy, cliched book when I see it.Second, Paolini obviously didn't mean for Eragon to be as immature as you think it is. His own website shows his pretentiousness in quotes like ""I strive for a lyrical beauty somewhere between Tolkien at his best and Seamus Heaney's translation of Beowulf."" He's comparing his own work to established classics, so why shouldn't we do the same? Face it. Eragon's not a decent children's book. It's a poorly written adult book and anyone, no matter how old he or she is, has the right to criticize it."
4,Still A Pretty Cool Book,"A lot of people say that Eragon is formulaic and stupid, and to a point I agree. A lot of the plot seems straight from a ""How To Write A Fantasy Coming-Of-Age Epic Story"" guide, but even so, I say the book is well-written, at least. I have read other books by people this age, and Eragon definately sounds the most mature, by far. My only real critique is that Eragon seems to become unconscious in almost every chapter of this book. So, I guess I would call it: good, but with flawed moments.Still, you have to admit it sounds a lot better than most teenagers' writing (I would know, I am one). And yes, I am going to buy Eldest when it comes out. (Sigh) I guess I sold out to The Man."
5,Eragon (Great new book),"Of all the books I read last year this one was the most exciting. The only 3 to come close were by some pretty famous authors like Melanie Rawn, John Marco, and Robert Jordan. The difference was this book was just so hard for me to put down that I read it in just 3 evenings. I would highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a little something new!"
2,Disappointing,"You can tell this book was written by a kid. I've found it very dull reading, and can't imagine why it's sold so many copies. Maybe it's the novelty of it having been written by a home-schooled kid, because it certainly isn't the gripping narrative. Nothing happens in this book for pages and pages. And the emotions that Eragon expresses; well, as I said, you can tell it was written by a kid because there's just no sophistication to the language or story telling. You'd be better off reading the Artemis Fowl series (fun and funny), of if you're older, the His Dark Materials series (sophisticated and thoughtprovoking)."
1,not very good,"Christopher is trying to create an elabrate world of destiny, magic, and dragons, the cover and introduction looked cool but the text was the corniest thing ever! cornier than any sitcom i've ever seen!!! i mean it had unneccasary chapters and stupid magic, no offense chris i appreciate the effort. If you (reader) think it looks good read it: opinions are like armpits everyone has and they all stink"
1,A REAL STINKER,Eragon is a total joke. I'm like the only one I know who finished it. Most of my friends tossed theirs. Does any character do anything it makes sense on it? Stupid. Stupid. Stupid. Stupid. Stupid. Stupid.
1,Stick to Harry Potter,"Want original fantasy that is interesting, new, and fun to read? Steer clear of this book. I suggest Terry Brooks' original ""Sword of Shanarra"" series. It is not high fantasy but it's better than this rip-off. Ech. I had to take a shower once I finally finished it. Boy am I glad I borrowed and did not buy this stinker!!"
4,The book that changed my view of reading!,"When I first picked up Eragon I said to myself, ""This is a big book. I'll never be able to finish it."" And so I picked up the book, sat on my bed and started to read. It was like a whole new adventure with every changing chapter that I got through reading. The book would calm down for a chapter and then suddenly new people would come to life and appear in the story. I could not believe it. I was half way through the book! Now I have started on the second book and I can't wait to finish it so I can go on to the next adventure.I rate this magnificent book 4,1/2 stars. Go to the closest library and get this book! NOW!!"
4,A great first novel and beginning to a series with alot of potential!,"This book was awesome from start to finish...paced very well, written very well, and a great plot. Unfortunately the movie butchered it, like most movies usually do. A great read!"
2,Familiar characters,"One word best describes this book: Derivative. The author didn't have to do very much description of his fantasy world because all the players were ""borrowed"" from other authors' worlds --- especially Tolkien's. Paolini didn't have to explain the relationship between elves & humans & dwarves, since Tolkien fans already know all that. Fine; it's fan-fiction. But I was very disappointed that Paolini didn't give Tolkien a mention in his Acknowledgements section.Paolini even tried to mimic LotR by including some ""translated"" elvish poetry. That was by far the most embarrassing part of this book. Prose was stilted (really needed some professional editing), but the poetry was just . . . awful. Glad it was only attempted once.Despite the book's flaws, I did enjoy the story line, and did read the book all the way through. I may even borrow a copy of ""The Eldest"" when it comes out. But I would not pay money for it."
5,"Harry Potter for kids, Eragon for teens!","A book you don't want to put down once you get going and one that you'll want to read many times, each time something you didn't notice comes to life and you love it even more. Few books can do that do you, and this one did to me. Like Harry in Harry Potter Eragon is thrown into an andventure that will change him and the world he lives in. However, it is much more mature with our man character already becoming a young adult with bloody fights and battles."
3,Eragon,"This is a good book for people who like fantasies. However, it is very long. Some of the fantasy parts were incorrect. Magic does not come from dragons and it can be learned by anyone who wants to learn it. Also dragons can be both good or evil and none of the dragons were evil. Eragon and company made a great team, even though they still had there differences. Overall this could have been a better book."
5,I LOVED this book!!!,"I absolutely adore this book! I didn't want it to end (that's saying something cuz it sure is long)! The charcters are very developed. I felt like I knew Eragon and Saphira. At the end, my stomach was in knot from the excitement and suspense. Paolini creates a world that feels very real. It has a history, laws, and many different races of creatures. Don't pass this book up!"
1,Borderline Plagiaristic,Eragon is a fluffy version of Lord of the Rings or the Wheel of Time. It shouldn't have been published.I recommend reading The Golden Compass by Philip Pullman instead of Eragon. It is much deeper and much more original.
3,Eragon Book,"The first time it was shipped, it was damaged because of poor packaging. But, I sent it back and the second time you sent it priority and it was packaged very well. However, it is a lot of trouble to have to send it back and wait and wonder if the next shipment is going to be okay."
4,Awsome Book,I recommend this book to anyone who loves fantasy and suspence all in one book. although it had some slow parts the ending was great and i cant wait to read the next book.
3,Eragon,"Whew! It's generally not a good sign when it takes me longer than a week to plow through a book, especially when it's not terribly long. Paolini has a beautiful writing style and has the most detailed descriptions which, as a writer, I appreciate greatly, but as a reader bored me to no end. The story and characters themselves were captivating, inviting, and interesting, and made you want to read, but the overly lengthy descriptions and explosion of unnecessary details seemed to swallow the interest and the pleasure in reading it. Eragon is an excellently written novel in its own right, and my rating is not at all judged on Paolini's talent as an author-it's just judged on the ""enjoyability"" level the reader can gain from this novel as a whole, which was only so-so on my scale.Read the specifics?[...]~Thalia Anderson"
4,Very Excellent...A new Fave...just a little unoriginal,"ERAGON has joined my favorites shelf for a long time. I truly enjoyed the story, which, yes was a bit like Star Wars and Tolkien and Anne McAffrey...but then, what books aren't? I mean, how many books have you read that changes the, say, elves from Tolkien's traditional silver-haired, long-living graceful creatures to anything else? The public just wouldn't accept it.Despite the resemblence to Tolkien and the names, which were, yes, very much like those of the LOTR's, I really loved this book. The story keeps you reading, and in fact, my only complaint about the actually narration and the events is that Eragon tends to black out way too much. I felt like every other chapter began with ""as Eragon blinked and opened his eyes..."" or ended with ""and suddenly it all went black.""Otherwise, a highly entertaining read...I attribute the ""copycatting"" of other authors as just a sort of respect andlooking-up-to to them. Please read! I highly reccomend it!"
4,Good but needs some work,"I thought that the novel was, on the whole, an entertaining read. Although the author clearly mixed the plots of Star Wars and Lord of the Rings, he did it in such a way that I was still wondering what would happen next. I am extremely interested in reading 4th book."
2,Why do so many people love this book?,"I don't mean to insult the fans of Eragon, but I can't see why other teenagers find this book so amazing. After reading the first page, one can guess immediately that it was not written by an adult. Some may argue that it's very good for the writing of a teenager, but I must disagree. Every idea is a cliche. Every creature is noticeably familiar. Every event is predictable. The character development, though present, seemed very forced, as did most other aspects of the novel. I quickly became weary of the overdone descriptions and awkward dialogue and phrases. The standard elementary school rules of ""show, don't tell"" are violated all too often. Worst of all, Mr. Paolini didn't make me ""care"" about the characters, so the plot itself was worthless to me. Even as an avid reader, I honestly had to push myself to finish reading this. I advise you to save yourself the time and boredom--don't bother reading this book."
2,His age is no excuse...,"To be honest, criticisms of this book have already been voiced a hundred times before, and better than I could say. Derivative, unashamedly cliched and dull...sadly, it's all true. But one thing that keeps popping is the author's age. The fact is that blaming the poor quality of the writing on his youth is a bit of a cop out. If you can write well, you can write well no matter how old you are. Sure, you improve as you go along, but a novice writer who starts at the age of 30 can be just as bad as a novice who starts at 13. Don't give this kid the excuse; talent shows at any age, and he has very little."
1,"Please, make it stop!","A friend gave this book to me with the advice that it was the best book she had ever read. With that in mind, I began reading yesterday.I doubt I will be able to finish it, though I have given it the great attempt.The plot is derivative, the characters have major mood swings and little continuity of characterization. The emotions are over the top - screaming because of minor slights, then back to normal within the same paragraph. The overuse of adjectives and descriptive tags is annoying.Sigh.Yes, it's impressive that a teenager wrote a large tome. It shouldn't have been published without major editing. I suppose the plot can be overlooked as there are worse ones out there but the writing itself, while technically and gramattically correct is ponderous and frankly boring.Reading should not be a chore."
1,well... maybe for kids...,"While kids might like this story, the writing is shabby at best and really lacks any kind of skill with the language. Don't expect any material that Anne McCaffery and a thousand others haven't already slaughtered into meaninglessness."
1,"To Make an ""Eragon""","To Make an Eragon:Get a can of Lord of the Rings and pour it in a big pot.Add a couple of handfuls of Star Wars, a dash of Earthsea,and a pinch of Harry PotterStir together until not very well mixed.Dump in a large bag of obscure adjectives.Pour in a carton of monotony and useless descriptionMix until mixture resembles throwupPour into pan and bake until charcoal and smellyDecorate nicelyAsk your parents to market itGo on a giant sales tour, bragging about age and TolkienismPromise a thrilling trilogyWatch people devour your cake but run away before you see them throw up - then ignore any and all advice that might help you to make a better recipe and continue stirring up the same unedible slop.Copyright Christopher Paolini (even though his material infringed about a million of those circled c's)"
1,What a waste of paper,"This book is really lame. Boring, obvious, predictable, superficial, weak. Don't waste your time and money on this book, as I sadly did.I'm not a ""fantasy veteran"", but you don't need to be one to notice this book is the work of an amateur. Shame on the publisher for killing trees to print it.If you are considering reading this book, go and re-read Tolkien.To Christopher Paolini, you should read Tolkien too, so you can see how far you are from writing a good book."
5,Very Well Writen,This book is very well writed and keeps you on the edge of your seat untill the last word.
1,Parental Control,"I was amazed that such a young man could write so well. Then the story itself is thoughful and exciting for the younger generation. I enjoyed it just as I enjoy all the Harry Potter books. They are good reading. But to also learn his parents helped him publish it and sell it, is remarkable. Not too many parents like that any more. We could use a whole lot more for examples and we would then have more productive young people."
3,An average book I still enjoyed,"After all the negative downplay I read in here, I was still curious to read myself and see what I thought. Does it copy other books? Some of the underlying ideas are there yes, but it certainly doesn't seem stolen. What? The author read lots of fantasy and sci-fi and borrows some for his own? Lots of writers do that. Heck, Mr. Lucas did, though not from the same genre. I guess it's just more obvious in this book.The storytelling in Eragon is what pulled me along. No real surprises presented themselves, so I didn't think it was a great book, but still a good one. The only thing that really bothered me about Eragon is a scene where he gets overly punished (like a 15 year old??) for something that seemed reasonable in the context of the story.I feel that the next book, Eldest, builds on this book and the Inheritance is turning into one of my favorite series. Kind of feels like the Harry Potter series, honestly, in that way."
5,Stunning First Book,"I've read most of the fantasy literature. I'm a 57 year old professional, and I was hooked by an online excerpt. I read this book on my PALM! I came close to missing my train stop more than once this week, and that's because I was so deeply involved with the story. I admit there are places where the writing is less than elegant--but for all those places, there are many more where I could have said that I wish I could have written that. I noticed that the first edition paperback is selling for hundreds of dollars. Obviously, the book has sold itself well enough to penetrate the nearly impenetrable world of publishing. It is that good. Considering Paolini is still a teen ager, the book is a small miracle. I am looking forward to the next volume, and I'm only sorry that I can't read it now."
1,completely predictable,"i couldn't finish this book. it was too predictable, which made it very boring. i don't like to read books that remind me of other books. this is one. save your money, it's not a good book. nice cover though."
1,embarrassing indeed,"Though I suppose that Mr Paolini is quite well off for the moment, somebody should get him down to earth and get him to know that things like that are no feat and that his readers (unless they do earnestly think that this bunk is ""innovative"") are bored to the bones."
1,Um...Dragons Lexicon Triumvirate please?,"This book has no originality. I mean, it's about a kid with dragons. Oooooo. Am I supposed to be impressed.Not to mention:1. The writing is bad.2. The story is predictable.3. Eragon is a stupid name, derivative of Aragorn.You ask me, the best dragons book out there right now is Dragons: Lexicon Triumvirate, written by the youngest sci fi novelist in the world."
4,"Come on, people!","People are so upset about this book,but it isn't that bad, it's even good. So the author used some plots from movies,it still has thungs in it that are good. I think the cover is beyond awesome,the dragon has her own personality, you can tell. Imagine riding a blue dragon,what a rush that would be. This isn't my favorite book but it's still good."
2,Eragon,"Paolini was fifteen years old when he began writing this book. This shows. The writing style is immature, and the tone is inconsistant. At one point, he will speak in almost medieval syntax, in the tone of a story of knights and dragons, and in the next, in the tone of a fifteen year old boy speaking with his friends. In addition, the main character bears a remarkable to the author, and the novel frequently refers to how close he is to 'manhood'. His references to women are frequently demeaning. This is a teenage boy's published daydreams of heroism and beautiful women indebted to him, because he will never achieve what he writes. It is not epic or grand or even uniqe. This novel would be a waste of your earnings."
5,GREAT for those who love adventure!,"Ya I wanted to tell everyone that this is a GREAT book, for ALL ages, Now I have read this book and wanted to do nothing more than read more. This book made me laugh out loud, made me attempt to hold tears back, made me smile, made me mad. This is an EXCELLENT book! Now it upset me to hear someone down thi book in reviews, but I can tell by his/her words that it is a person who is one of those I know everything I am grand lord of al people, so if your like that, then I dont know what to say, if you simply want a GREAT book that you can enjoy and fall in love with, the join the world of Eragon, If you love action adventure, and emotions to be invoked as you become intimate with the characters and their adventures, this is the book for you. =) Enjoy"
1,I Could Write A Better Book,"The only thing that grabs any attention to the ""Inheritance"" series is that Paolini is only 17. If the exact same book was written by a 40-year-old, the book would have sold about 50 copies. The book is completely a ripoff of good sci-fi stories and the plot makes no sense. No sense whatsoever. Do us all a favor and buy a Get Fuzzy comic book. PEACE OUT!LOCAL CRAZY MONKEY"
1,PAINFUL read - awful,"I suffered through this book because I remembered that my friend liked it. When I saw him afterwards and asked him what he had liked about this book...he said ""OH - I never liked that book - it was horrible"". I've wasted part of my life reading this book...I'm not going t spend much more time on this review. Miserable read. The other reviewer's sum it up nicely."
1,Worst book ever,"Awful doesn't begin to cover it. An avid reader, I've read 80 books already this year. I've been a fantasy reader for 40 years, and I've read almost every fantasy book ever written. I can't believe I was suckered into buying this by the glowing reviews. Originally this was self-published, and there's a reason for it. ""Eragon"" is the worst book ever written, even if you count ""Eldest"" which brings fantasy to a new low. This book is filled with awkword phrases, bad dialogue, and muddled plots. Why in the world anyone would write a review of this book I don't know. It's really that bad."
3,That English teacher's review got it right,"Tell me if any of these are familiar:* Secretive, immortal elves with pointy ears and bows, whocame from a wonderous land over the sea to the West* Untrusting, secretive dwarves who live and work inmagnificent underground mine-cities and fight with axes* Dragons who choose a human partner at birth and communicatewith them telepathically. The partners are called""Dragon Riders""I'll stop there."
3,Paolini has plenty of time to get better,"Eragon was extremely good for a fifteen year old, but, that aside, the language was bombastic and arrogant, the pacing was shaky, and cause and effect was a little off. In short, the editor needed to commit far more adverbicide. I couldn't get into the plot, because I was scratching my head over the trippy language. I can't wait to see what this author turns out in 20 years, though."
2,well written....,"This book is very well written, and very interesting, until you discover one thing: it's exactly the same as Star Wars. The plot is the same, characters have the same roles. The author needs to get creative."
2,Painfully Bad Writing,"While it's fine that it was written by a kid, the writing is painfully bad. If you want to read good writing rather than a gimmick, try another book."
5,Absolutely Amazing,"This book is just amazing. Eragon was a masterpiece, but Eldest was much better. Way more battles and events. If you've read Eragon, read this, you will not regret it. This is probably one of my all-time favorite books."
5,Simply wondeful,thats all there is to it. wonderful. well written and amazing story. the second one is a it better but they are both great.
5,Best fantasy book ever,"Despite what other people have said about this book, it is most likely the best fantasy book that I have EVER read! The people that complained about his language and choice of words obviously didn't read the book that I read. His vocabulary in this book was OUTSTANDING! I can't believe that he is only 19! And, just because he knows to use other words besides 'said' doesn't make the book tacky!!!!! I think that its awesome that he uses rich vocab. Many books written by accomplished authors don't even write as well as this man did!!! I can't believe that people could criticize a book and dislike it just because he has wonderful vocabulary in this book. The people whom criticized it probably are just upset and jealous because they didn't know what the words meant and don't have that good of a vocabulary. This book is awesome with a deep plot, developed characters, and tense battles. Read it!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Fun read.,"This book was a fun read. There are times that you can tell that the writer was in his mid to late teens when he wrote it, and other times that he writes far beyond what you would expect from someone his age. Excellent read that I would recommend to any fan of this genre."
5,When Does the Next book come out?,"This is what I've been thinking ever sence I've finished the first book. I have almost 500 books at my house and so far this book is one of the greatest books I have ever read. After I finished reading this book I told my friends about it and after they finished reading it they couldn't stop asking ""When does the next book come out?"" If you like magic, mistery and adventure this book is for you. I'd recomend it to anyoneKyle Campbell, 14"
1,Terrible,"This book is just bad. If you are an eleven year old kid who's never experienced what true fantasy literature has to offer, I highly recommend it. You've got to start at the bottom after all ;-) Reading this will make discovering the true masters of the genre that much more delightful.My suggestion--don't waste money on the hardcover if you bother to pick it up at all."
1,Trite and Hackneyed,"I was looking forward to ERAGON, after hearing good reviews about it here and there. What a disappointment. It just goes to show that you need more than the stereotypical `hero quest' parts to make a good story. This story is so obviously borrowed from the works of other writers (and movie-makers) before it; the author could not even come up with new creatures - instead falling back on dragons and elves. *Yawn* Frankly, I was not impressed with the writing, either. If I have to read a sentence three times before it makes sense, forget it. I couldn't even finish."
1,characters,"The biggest problem in this book (though not the only one) are the characters. Except for Angela, there is nothing special or different about any of the characters' personalities."
5,Best Book Ever,this book [rocks] once you start this book you don't stop I missed 3 meals cause of this book and it brings a tear to my I that the second one comes out next year
5,"Eragon (Inheritance, Book 1)","Christopher Paolini is one of the freshest new talents to join the fantasy world in a long time. His talent is a welcome addition. His characters come alive on Page 1 & never disappoint. Eragon & Saphira will have many exciting adventures in books to come. I am also looking forward to the movie that is in the works & hope Hollywood doesn't change a thing to spoil this wonderful story. Keep up the good work, Chris. Hope to see much more of you & your friends in the future."
3,"Typical Epic Fantasy, more originality, please!","Eragon is not a bad book. In fact, I would say it was quite good. The one major problem that it has, is a definate lack of originality. It has a (usually) bewildered hero, an old mentor who, naturally, dies, the son of a feared (albeit dead) enemy, mystical elves, sturdy dwarves, huge, ugly,monsters who utter coarse, gutteral sounds, a magical language, and firebreathing dragons! I mean, come on! I do not believe there were any original ideas in this entire book! Other than that it was quite well done. there are no typographical errors, not that I saw, anyways. The editing is fairly good, perhaps there is an over-enthusiastic use of the word ""said"", but overall, it is well done. The plot is well supported and the few plot errors I have seen are of little signifigance. The characters are pretty well developped and the setting is realistic. I look forward to the sequal, hoping feverently that it is more original than the first!"
5,ERAGON,THE BOOK HAD TO ARRIVE THE NEXT DAY BECAUSE MY DAUGHTER TOLD ME LATE THE NIGHT BEFORE THAT SHE NEEDED A DRAGON-LIKE BOOK. AND IT ARRIVED THE NEXT DAY. HER TEACHER WAS SURPRISED THAT SHE HAD HER BOOK THAT FAST.
3,eragon-,"Eh. The fantasy world is sort of a rip-off from Lord of the Rings, with similar creatures- elves, dwarves, orks, etc., though the Dragon Rider background/legend was pretty interesting. Eragon as a hero is not really all that charismatic or like-able, just sort of a bland guy that just happens to have a bigger fate. He doesn't grow too much throughout the book either, but the plot is relatively interesting enough to ignore his lack of personality."
1,I've read worse,"I've certainly read worse stories, but the sheer amount of typos and grammatical mistakes and misuse of words alone turned me off to this book. I was barely a chapter in before I had a pencil in hand and was becoming more and more preoccupied with the mistakes than the plot. Shouldn't an editor have caught these? That alone was painful, and not to mention the dialogue and the awkward sentences themselves. I had hoped that this child ""prodigy"" book would actually be good, not a book that sounded like something I had written when I was fifteen."
1,Horrible!!!!!!!!!,It is one of the worst books I've ever read. It is so lame! I am so sorry that I paid for this book and am trying to return it. Whoever is hyping this garbage maskerading as a book should just stop!!!!!!!
1,Steer Clear,"Eragon was written for children. Laden with overdone cliches and unbelievable heroics straight out of a adolescent's imagination, it came as no surprise that the author is a young teenager. My suspension of disbelief cannot bear a sixteen year old boy becoming a master swordsman in six months time, without ever enduring a real fight. Or an ageless elven beauty falling in love with same boy. I was constantly asking myself where all the MEN in this book were hiding. Anyone looking for serious fantasy should avoid Eragon."
1,How can you give this tripe 5 stars?,Anyone who gets to stay up later than 9 PM would recognize that this book stinks. This kid isn't any worse than some of the other fantasy pulp-mysters out there but he's not worthy of anything approaching a good review. Gonna' be on a desert island for a few months? I'd rather read the palm leaves....
3,"Give the poor guy a break, will ya?","Really, I don't know what all the critisizm is about. I mean, sure he uses too many synonyms of 'said', so what. Fine he could have created a 'more original' plot, but hay, at least he tried. So what if the villans name is Shade instead of some creepy Rlookjnfdv. So what! Really, I think the 'experts' should give the guy a break. I mean, it must be pretty tough writing a 400 pages per book trilogy based on a nine-step fantasy plot format."
5,magical,"Eragon is one of the best books i have read. if u havnt read it i dont know where've youve been. oh well. the story starts out with a bang leaving you in question, when the plot shows you Eragon, a 15 year old, who is hunting when he stumbles upon a large blue rock, or so he thinks. The rock ends up being a dragon egg and when it hatches, Eragon becomes her rider. i wont say anymore, it has a lot of dramatic points and its sure to keep you occupied."
1,excruciatingly unoriginal,"I'd heard about this book--with all those marketing dollars, who hasn't? Started reading it, and the more I read the more I began to feel a sense of unreality that this particular book is getting so much marketing attention. It's nothing but a passably written string of cliches wandering through a maze of better writer's ideas. After reading 200 pages I gave up in disgust. The publishing industry created celebrity status in the young author because of his youth and got away with it. But I do know young people who are very original and profound, even wise in their thinking. This book is excruciatingly UNoriginal, lacking in depth, and the style of writing is immature at best. Bottom line, if you buy it you're only proving the marketers right--that the public can be led by marketing dollars, even turning a silly imitative book like Eragon into a bestseller."
1,shameless,"J.R.R. Tolkien: 'The time of the Elves has passed."" Christopher Paolini: ""The time of the Riders has passed."" Hmmm. You may not agree with me, but I'd call that cheating in a big way. As a mother, I think it's too bad this author is getting so much press when what he did was quilt together patches from any fantasy source I can think of--books, movies, games--and the stitching isn't even very good. Since when is it 'classic' to take what others have done and call it your own? Although I didn't see anything truly original in this boo, having read other fantasy authors, I wonder how Paolini would feel if there had been something really original in his book and someone else had taken it and made a fortune off of it. Well you might not agree, but what should I say to my own kids about givin gcredit where credit is due?"
1,The Worst Book Ever...,"I think I can honestly say this is one of the worst books I have ever read. If Paolini ever learns to stop manipulating his characters, come up with his own storylines, and cut out all annoying, irrelevent descriptive passages, he might become a decent writer. As it is...If you are unfamiliar with Tolkien, Lucas, and Mccaffrey, Paolini's blatent plagarism may not bother you. Who knows, you might actually enjoy the book."
1,I've read better fan fiction,"OK if you read the one-star reviews of this book, you will get the picture. This is one big fat rip-off, and anyone who knows the fantasy genre could have told you that. But if you've never read any fantasy except Harry Potter, you will probably be impressed, seeing as how the 'author' of Eragon took a lot of good ideas from other writers."
1,All or Nothing,"It's odd that the reviews of this book all seem to be either glowing praise with 5 stars, or complete disappointment (1 star).I'm about half way through this book, and let me tell you, absolutely nothing interesting has happened yet.Paolini's writing is full of promise, but in this book it is clumsy and boring. Character interaction feels forced, and there is no chemistry.The worst part is the pacing. This book is a terribly slow read. I cannot imagine the story needing to continue over a part II and part III.I will read the remainder of this book to see if it improves. But at this point, I have to admit, the positive reviews puzzle me. This book is not what those reviews promised it would be."
3,The up-and-comer in classic fantasy fiction,"Many reviewers have addressed the opening of the book, the awkwardness of the first chapters and the formulaic treatment of plot and traditional fantasy peoples. Uh huh, all that is true.What is also true is that this is a first rate first novel. I've read (and finished, more is the pity) much worse. It's new classical fantasy fiction. Yes, it derives much from Tolkein, Eddings, McCaffery, et al. And some folks are bored with that and looking for a new voice and are correct to say ""don't look for that here"". But if you enjoy the classic coming-of-age, heroic quest type of story, LOOK HERE. Mr. Paolini has created a very readable (once you get past the first few chapters) book."
4,A very good read,"I have to admit that, having just read this book myself, I'm surprised that a lot of people seem to have found major faults with it. No, it is not the greatest book, or even the greatest fantasy book, I've ever read. In fact, early on I thought that it was fairly slow developing, and I began to wonder if I would like it. But once the Ra'zac come into the picture and the main character begins his quest, the story improves and grows far more interesting.I didn't find the story any more derivative than any epic fantasy tale will surely be in the wake of the grand sire of the genre, Lord of the Rings, and the story had enough uniqueness of its own to entertain. I haven't read Eldest yet, but I hope Paolini builds on what he's written here. If he does, I can't wait to read it.- Gregory Bernard Banks, author"
3,What's all the adult hype about?,"Yes, I agree with everyone else, this book is a remarkable feat for a 17yr old author. However, as I read it, I kept sensing that it was obviously written by a teenager. The plot is basic and the characters lack a lot of depth - it just felt so predictable. Although my 12yr old daughter found it boring, I would definitely recommend to teen readers who enjoy the fantasy genre. As for adult readers, I can't figure out what all the hype is about."
3,Eragon,"The first thing you should know about Eragon is that it is exquisitely written. Paolini engages in a wordfest the likes of which have never been seen in children's books. This book held me captivated as I read it in 3 days.Unfortunately, the book fails in many ways. For one thing, all the plot ""twists"" are just chunks of fantasy thrown in to drag out the book. Indeed, these twists feel more like potholes in the story and one tires of them very easily. The plot feels forced from the point when Eragon's house is destroyed onward; the vast majority of the book.Eragon is a worthwhile read, but I'm not enthusiastic to read a sequel."
2,Close but no cigar...,"FINE...I admit it. It's a decent book. I have some squirmishes with the editing, but all in all, the story itself isn't bad. That isn't to say, of course, that the book is downright amazing. In fact, far from it. Paolini is hopelessly derivative of older and far better fantasy novels (Lord of the Rings anyone?) That isn't the major problem because a lot of fantasy novelists have done that, but the best and most successful of them (J.K Rowling for example) have at least used these old ideas and made them new and interesting. Paolini does not. The bottom line is: if you've never read a fantasy novel, you'll love it. If you have, then don't bother. There's nothing new."
5,A great book,"This book is one of the best I have read in a long time! I am a big Harry Potter fan and Eragon is as good or better than Harry Potter. I was surprised that such a young author wrote this book! Paolini uses a rich vocabulary that is beyond what the normal 15-19 year old has. The vocabulary helped make the mental images more clear and vibrant. I recommend Eragon to anyone who enjoys Harry Potter, sci-fi/fantasy, or to anyone who enjoys a good read."
1,Awful :(,"This is a very bad imitation of Lord of the Rings. I bought it thinking that it was going to be a good and enjoyable book, but instead I've been reading counting the pages anxiously until I finished it. Will definitely do not recommend to anyone, and will certainly not read the 2nd book. You should go and read Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter which are books that you cannot stop reading... This one is not worth your time."
2,"Awful, it was boring and focuses too much on fantasy","A fantasy story? How terrific! Only this falls flat. The plot was conventional and everything about it was mundane. There was nothing extraordinary to say about it. The boy goes on a quest to save the Empire but honestly I don't know how this exactly go to be a bestseller, not to say I have actually read the whole book! Fantasy books may probably be not my thing but this doesn't seem to offer enough lessons or interesting views on things you relate to. The plot is slow and there is something kind of odd in talking to a dragon who speaks through your mind. This book is a failure and this is just a journey on a fantasy adventure. Recommendations on improving is make your characters more stimulating or engaging, make them with character or a little humor. Also, it probably would help if they would meet recurring characters that would provide comic relief. This book simply falls behind expectations and was a waste of my time."
1,Boring and bad writing,All I can say is that i couldnt get through it. Poorly written and rather boring. I love a good fantasy book and there are many good ones out there that others have listed. Don't bother with this one
4,Eragon,Received book in a timely matter. Once got book I read and finished it in approximately one to two days.
2,Nothing new under the sun,"The rehashing of every Fantasy gimmick under the sun--from Tolkein to Le Guin to McCaffrey to Brooks--got so grating after a while that I was relieved when I got near the end of the book. The characters fail to resonate (and why should they when they're carbon copies of other, earlier works) and never engaged my sympathy. The use of language was also a weak point, and especially the constant use of other words than ""said."" when there is nothing wrong with ""said."" Overly flowery and pretentious language was grating, with examples of ""visage"" and ""raiment"" and their like sprinkled throughout the book.Overall, considering the author's age, it's not bad as a first attempt, but there are any number of stories like it already out there by more experienced writers, not to mention on fanfiction.net. I would suggest readers interested in a good Fantasy book head towards the original texts instead of this derivative one."
4,"Eragon, a copy made diverse.","Even though there are definate similarities between the Lord of the Rings and Eragon, the storylines are completely original and imaginative. If all of the stories had to be completely different from one another, millions of great stories would be thrown away just for beginning with one upon a time or for having similar creatures. Almost every author in history has borrowed ideas from other authors. Eragon is in my opinion a great story with an equally amazing sequal. the villains are excellant, the heroes are likeable and there are even those moments that make your heart swell with tears. All in all, it is a book well written and one that I hope will keep astounding readers for generations to come."
2,Rip-off or Homage?,"Mr Paolini's writing aside (it's serviceable, but unremarkable), I find it highly amusing that so many people accuse him or ripping off LOTR and Star Wars. LOTR owes much to Scandinavian Mythology (which Tolkien revered), and George Lucas took the plot for Star Wars directly from Akira Kurosawa's film ""The Hidden Fortress"". While there may not be much ""original"" in ""Eragon"" or ""Eldest"", Paolini's source material wasn't entirely original, either."
2,Kids will like it!,"Well, I'm about half way through the book. I started reading it about 3 months ago...hmm... I think it's a great book for let say a middle schooler. I'm a big LOTR fan so maybe I expected too much I don't know but to me it seems like it's a 15 year old's version of Tolkien. Although I think he probably did have some help rephrasing some sentences here and there. There are just some expressions in the book that I wouldn't expect from a kid his age. And that mixed together with the overall kids-book-feeling is just strange for me.I do agree with the reviewer before me though, it's an excellent work from a 15 year old!"
1,Three words:,"Dragons: Lexicon Triumvirate. That book beats Eragon on every level. Eragon is a worthless piece of scribble that just got lucky because the baby that wrote it was 15. Dragons: LT, on the other hand, is original, for it is about cyborg dragons."
4,It was okay,"Well, it's not Harry Potter, but it copmes across nicely for a 17 yr old. It's about this boy Eragon and he finds a dragon egg and becomes a dragon rider. I wouldn't say it's a ripoff, because most fantasies are rip offs anyway. I think that anyone who likes this book should also read Dragons: Lexicon Triumvirate."
5,Excellent book for the whole family,"If your family enjoys sci-fi movies and books, this book will be great for the whole family. The realism and descriptions of characters in this book are beyond any book I have read. It is a definite page turner you don't want to put down. Where is book #3?"
4,Good Start,I think this is a good read. I think the real test will be the second book. It has the foundation to really be a nice series. If your looking for a good christmas present for your young adult that you can sneak a read also this is it.
2,Too Early,"When I first saw this book and what the title was, I thought, ""Eragon? Sounds a LOT like Aragorn..."". Nevertheless, I read the book and I loved it for it's easy to understand writing and plot...I still think that with time and experience, Paolini could shine because he DOES have potential, but he shouldn't have written so early. Perhaps he needs to grow into his talent before he writes because although his writing showed promise, there were WAY~ too many similarities between his book and LOTR, SW Trilogy, etc...I felt like I was reading a fusion of the above mentioned fantasies (a quite MESSY fusion)...I'm quite sure you all know what I am talking about. If not, just read the other reviews.All in all, I am disappointed because of paolini's TOTAL lack of creativity. Hopefully he develops his OWN plot in the next book of the Inheritance..."
3,Falls short of the real deal,"It's a watered-down version of Lord of the Rings repackaged with Dragonriders of Pern. Disappointing to say the least, especially after all the hype."
2,"Unfortunately, a very boring book",Perhaps I've read too many books in this genre but I found myself hating this book more and more as I read it. It was very unoriginal and the ending seemed thrown together at the last minute. I did like that important characters die but the characters weren't developed enough for me to care too much about them.I realize the author was a teenager when he wrote the book. But hat doesn't get me my $10 back.
3,I want to know where the guy below me got his info,"Far as I know, Eldest hasn't been realized yet, but I;d like to thank the reviewer below me for spoiling the next book. Thanks alot, kid. Its kids like you that give us other kids a bad name in reviewing....You might be Paolini...or a friend or neighbor, but that doesn't matter....Now on to my review. Eragon was an okay, 3 star book. If you grade on how fast you read it, then it gets a five. I read it within 24 hours. I thought it was great then, when i first read it, now its just okay. I've read all of those other books Paolini rips off and am horrified.But its not all that bad. I've read worse. At least Paolini drew kids into liking to read. That's the important thing i guess...I am getting the second book. If it shapes up, then I'll get the third...but if the guy below me is right, it has a Stars Wars: The Empire Strikes Back quality to it....Yoda and that O-guy, Murtaugh and Leia.........."
2,Nothing special,"This book is too much like ""Lord of the Rings"". Even some sentences are the same (""Fly, you fools""). I did read it, but I will probably not buy second one."
3,It sucks in a good way?,"I agree with everyone who has written a review kind of. It was a book that seemed to have big gaping holes between action. Confusing and overused- not a good combination. Also, I find it irking that everyone is all ""WOW"" over the fact that he's a teeager. I mean, he's seventeen. He is BARELY a teenager and should be counted as an adult. The book also had a lot of dips and was extremely boring in some parts. I didn't like the title or the character names, which seemed cliched and modern. However I did find it something amusing to read. Despite that I'm not wasting money on the second book."
1,Read Something Else,"The greatest accomplishment of Christopher Paolini is that he and his family managed to get this thing published and that it found an audience. The writing is terrible, just terrible. I can't comment on the entertainment value this book may hold for some. After about eight chapters of some of the most juvenile prose in print I had to put this aside. There's lots of good, even great fantasy out there awaiting eager readers. They'd do well to skip over Eragon and seek out its betters."
1,"Oh my GOD I'm dying! a.k.a. Use the force, Christopher!",Age is no excuse for crime.Parents should protect their children.You should use critizism to your advantage.Something very smelly smells better than Eragon's I'm-so-perfect-and-everyone-agrees-stuff.A scar on your back doesn't mean you're crippled and the world is ending.That's the five rules of life and I stick to it.
1,"Sadly done, Christopher Paolini","Eragon is an epic journey of a small boy who is a peasant, and is telepathically linked with a dragon. This opens up to a regular fantasy plot, they go off and fight good vs. evil. It was upsetting to read this book, partly because of all the unoriginal ideas that were smashed together. Eragon is pretty much the mixture between Star Wars and Lord of the Rings, most of the writing seems more copied than written itself.The List of Good things:1. Nicely Done Cover2. Some parts included colorful demonstration of writing.The List of Bad Things:1. Copied from Lord of the Rings. (see other reviews for lists)2. Copied from Star Wars. (see other reviews for facts and list)3. Poorly done dialogue.4. Biggest cliche a fantasy fan can ever see.Why this book has received publicity:1. Christopher Paolini and his family's ability to promote the book well by spending money for promotions, etc.2. Was written by a 15 year old."
2,don't leave me hanging,"I just could not get this book. I was so confused with this made up language and the the main character drove me nuts! Is he this great dragon rider who can use magic, or is he a pouty teenager from the 21st century.When I got to the end I was so upset because I felt that there was so much that has been left unanswered. I felt that I was left hanging with some important issues, such as Eragons parents. It seemed to me that at the begining of the book he cared a great deal with wanting to know about his parents, especially his dad. But when it was discussed later on in the book Eragon never tried to find out any information. Especially when the character Brom talked about his mother and the fact that he knew her. Which led me to come up with my own speculation of...was Brom his father? Who knows because nothing was revealed."
5,BEST BOOK EVER,"This is the best book I have ever read, despite the fact that I have read so many fantasy books. The book is amazing and I personally cannot wait until the next book in the series ""Eldest"" hits the shelves. Another thing that makes this book amazing is the fact that it is written by a 19 year-old. Once the Inheritance trilogy is all out, I will be looking foward to other books by this author."
2,Thats what you get when it is edited by the writers parents,"I think the biggest problem with this book is that it was published and edited by his parents. I admit I thought it was pretty bad, in fact it was some of the worst fantasy I have ever read. When a real editer would have helped this very weak writing come up to snuff, instead his parents went along with him."
4,Come on people!,"I liked this book a lot, dragons and mysteries are alway good together. I been reading a lot of revews for this book and so many people comare it to Lord of the Rings. IT""S A BOOK!!! If it was about a frobbit named Codo, then I would be worried about that, but it's not. It's about a boy who's trying to find out who he really is. So many books are like others, it's common. So forget about Tolkien and read the book for what it is, a book!"
1,A dry story,"I won't bother rehashing old arguments. Eragon is derivative and there's nothing that can be done about that. I understand that fantasy usually is derivative. Star Wars and Lord of the Rings are also derivative of other sources. But what makes Eragon's derivativeness worse than that of Star Wars and LOTR? This book is dry. In SW and LOTR, there are interesting characters and action to mask the derivative elements. But Paolini says ""characters are born out of necessity"". The story has no soul; it has a plot but nothing else. That's why the cliches are more obvious in Eragon than in others books."
1,-Yawn-,"Hmm well i have been reading through the other reviews posted by fellow fiction readers. Hve you noticed that all the reviews entitled 'kids review' have 5 star and similar comments? Perhaps they have not read Lord Of The Rings? Maybe not seen Star Wars. Or perhaps they are just yound and impressionable, but either way this book was a complete waste of my time. Which I could have spent reading something decent, perhaps His Dark Materials Trilogy. I only read this book to the end because my friend, who had read and enjoyed the book, pressed me too. Hoping the book would get better i finished it, up until the last page I found my eyes rolling into the back of my head, the book literaly sent me to sleep.Take my advice Mr Paolini, give up. Go to college get a job, and forget all about this bad, bad time in your life!"
1,I've seen much better,"Fantasy is a difficult genre to work with because, at this point, nothing can really be spectacularly original anymore. However, fantasy writers can still be successful is they are skilled in either prose or storytelling. And there lies the problem with this book.Paolini, gifted though he might be, has not developped a great writing style or a gusto for plot. What makes writers like J.K. Rowling or Cornelia Funke so distinguished as fantasy writers is that they are able to take convention and make the most of them. Paolini, however, writes with a plodding hand that reminds of a bad high school short story and his plot seems like it's been taped together from a collection of other work.If you're not familiar with fantasy, then go ahead and read it. If you are, you're not missing much."
5,Great Stuff!,"Paolini is a very good writer. At the same time I was reading a Jackie Collins book, - compared to him, she is indeed a novice with obvious grammetical mistakes and infantile usage of words. Though she must be his great-grandmother's age, she writes like a 9 year old. Well Anyways coming back to Paolini - his greatness can be gauged by the fact that though I hate fantasy stuff, his prose make the charaters appear real - this is indeed a markmanship of an excellent writer and hopefully he continues to do the same!"
5,Captivating!,"This book was difficult to put down! It's a wonderfully written fantasy with a touch of mystery that adopts the familiar ideas of dragons, dwarves, elves and a young boy, and combines them in such a believable manner that you can almost feel as if you are part of the story as Eragon and Saphira endure both grief and victory. You laugh with them, you cry with them, and at the same time trying to unveil the true identities of several key characters leaves you hungering for the next chapter, and of course, for the next book! I can't wait!!"
1,Yuck,"Reads like a particularly bad D&D module got sick on and threw up a junior thesaurus. The ratio of made-up words is high, the name of the king is a mishmash of the lead Decepticon from Transformers and 'dominatrix,' words aren't used properly, and there's a huge amount of redundant language. I realize this is the author's first book, but doesn't his publisher have editors?"
5,A fun read-'nuff said,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book--it is a fun read and a page turner. Why do folks want to turn everything into high-art? The author approaches this with very little pretense, so I wonder why folks cannot appreciate this for simply being a good, entertaining read. The same with complaints that it is a derivative work. OK, find me another piece of fiction that is not derivate of the works that precede it? Get the book. Read it. Enjoy it. 'Nuff said. :)"
4,"Almost didn't read this, but then...","a friend of mine leant it to me. Based on some of the reviews from the other adults on this site I was hesitant to read it. However, I thought it was very well done and a great read and I'm 40+. Can there be comparisons to LOTR? Yes, most definitely. But then again, if you look at any fantasy book you can find comparisons to LOTR. Sure there are elves and dwarfs, but Stephen King even has Elves and Dwarfs in his book ""Talisman"", but I don't hear people comparing that to LOTR and there are no dragon riders in LOTR, that I can recall.Anyway, if you're like I was and are sitting on the fence about reading this book take the leap and give it a try. I really think you'll enjoy it and forget all this stuff about ""it's well written for a 17 year old""...it's well written period."
3,Unoriginal and yet quite interesting.,"I think this story was very problematic because mostly it wasn't innovative at all. for example You can see blindly that many ideas are taken from the original Star Wars series, for example: Eragon ""the great"" who begins his adventure as a farm boy just like Luke in ""Star Wars- A New Hope"", also the whole idea that once there were many dragon riders who kept peace and now there is only one left very much resembles the idea of the Jedi knights. Also most of the ideas of the elves, dwarves and the special languages are all taken from ""The Lord of the Rings"" series.Also every time something big happens Eragon faints, which is very annoying.Even though the story is very unoriginal and annoying the plot was sometimes very interesting though a little predictable."
3,Entertaining but I have heard this somewhere before,"Eragon is a good book, but it borrows so much from other books, movies and comics that it leaves you with a feeling that you have read this before.S. Smith"
3,Too long,"Good story, although not particularly original. MUCH longer than it needed to be. I found myself skipping page after page because the author was describing something mundane and unimportant in excruciating detail. It IS a really good story, though and that alone makes one want to finish the book. I just think it would have been better if it was just a little shorter."
3,"Not a total revelation, but could've been worse","Okay, so it's predictable, with the exception of Brom and Murtagh most the characters are flat, and it's pretty much Star Wars set in a fantasy world. But it's worth reading just the same. Why? Those battle scenes are pretty freakin' cool, and as far as Obi-Wan Kenobi ripoffs go, Brom's easily the best of the bunch. Still, book 2 is infinitely better, since Panoli was a few years older and got a chance to grow as a writer. I'm not sure why this was published while he was so young, though - I mean, I'm a young writer myself and wouldn't exactly have the stuff I wrote four years ago published (for the uninitiated, he wrote this at 15, and it was published when he was 19). Another little quibble I have: if Eragon's a poor, illiterate farmboy, how the hell is his vocabulary so advanced? And really, why all the fantasy cliches?You get a mix between the good and the bad with Eragon. All in all, it'll do, but it ain't exactly Harry Potter you're reading."
4,An exciting book,"I really liked this book because of the dragon, Saphira and how the boy, Earagon doesn't really want it at first but after a while he and Saphira become really close as they have many adventures. I think this book would be good for both girls and boys but mostly boys."
2,"Exciting sometimes, but not worth raving over","I kind of liked this book at first. I mean, it was pretty exciting halfway through. But then I started to realize something... This is exactly like the Lord of the Rings! Almost every single aspect of this book can be compared to LOTR. Look at this:Eragon- AragornBrom- GandalfRa'zac- Black RidersArya- ArwenAnd that's only some of the things I recognised. I haven't seen that much Star Wars, but even I can see the whole Jedi thing going on here too. The book was well written and all but hardly any of it was original. Borrow from the library instead of buying this book."
3,Rough around the edges and in the middle too.,"Warning: First paragraph is painful to read.If I only had a nickel for everytime I thought the word ""editor"" while trudging my way through this book. How I sighed lugubriously when pros halted awkwardly to explain the logic of the illogical ostentatiously.I pride myself on being able to finish anything(I know it's stupid), but I finally had to go skimming with 50 pages left in this book. When the action stops, the pages go by in slow motion. I don't know if I can make it through the next one; I hope that an editor was involved in the process of publishing that one, otherwise I'm toast.Live a little Mr. Paolini. All that stuff swirling inside your head will eventually dissolve and coalesce into originality and understanding of the human condition-things you can't fake no matter how many times you watch ""The Princess Bride"" or read ""The Lord of the Rings"".3 stars given for the author's determination and age."
4,Love dragons - love high fantasy - read this one!,"Truly enjoyed this book. This was the second time I have read it, but it has been a few years. Was refreshing to reread and realize that I liked it as much the second time through as I did the first time.The characters are fantastic and the plot exceptional. Well worth the read! I am hoping to find time to finish the rest of the series now that I have refreshed my memory of book one."
3,For Beginners,"It was obvious to me that Paolini was young when he began writing this book. Although very good for such a young author, it can't compare to much of the sci fi/fantasy I have read. The language of the book sounded like a young person with a thesaurus constantly by his side. I could have forgiven him for this except he made many of the characters also sound as if they kept a thesaurus by their side.The story itself is fun, if not entirely original. I am looking forward to the last book in the series and any future works by this author; I think that, as he matures, his originality and language will also."
5,I DIDN'T WANT TO PUT IT DOWN,This is one of the best books I have read. In no time I was hooked. I highly recommend this book.Saphira and Eragon are my favorite characters because they are in the most action. Buy this book for you and your kids. I cant wait for the next one.
4,Great story to listen to while driving across country,I have always liked reading Eragon. I made a road trip a couple of weeks ago and listening to Eragon made the mile fly by its a great adventure book.
5,too good to be true-best fantasy ever,"This book is the best book I have ever read. I recommend it to anyone who loves fantasy and adventure. It is good for young adults, teens and older kids. I love the way Eragon can speak to his dragon and the bond between them. I also love the spectacular sword fighting and the magic. It is an exciting adventure in which Eragon learns how to fight, use magic and make friends. Paolini did a good job describing this book and the many charcters. This book contains dragons, elves, dwarves, humans, magic, fighting and urgals and shades. You will love it as this is bound to be the the best fantasy book of the year-buy it"
5,I Loved Eragon!!!,"I thought Eragon was a really good book!! I love reading about all the different places they go to and I love the characters too! I would recommend that anyone who likes excitment, action, and a good story to read this book!"
3,readable yet derivative,"I didn't get into this book quickly and was worried at the beginning that it would be cheesy, but after reading for a while the pacing and character interaction were quite decent and I enjoyed it. I don't have much original to add to the reviews that have already been written, but I would have enjoyed this story more if it were more original. Lots of elements seemed to have been repeated from other fantasy novels, including a fight that takes place between a lake and a gate into a mountain that is right out of _Fellowship of the Rings_. Also, the plot twists were predictable, as when a character goes ""wow, I never would have guessed that..."" and I wanted to be like, the reader has had this figured out for about 200 pages now! There is a character named Arya in George R.R. Martin's series who is also a left-handed swordswoman, this is probably coincidental, unless the author was familiar with that series."
3,"Great Characters, but a recycled plot..",This book has very good characters. They grow and develop quite well. Unfortunately this overshadowed by the fact that he plot is easily guessed three or four chapters in advance. Another of this books shortcomings is that it blatantly steals nearly all of its material from other authors. Despite all of its short-comings I would still reccomend it.
4,"good, but hopefully will get better","I was very excited to read Eragon because I had heard so much about it. Unfortunately, it lacks originality and the writing style seems undeveloped. However, I could not put the book down and I did enjoy it. I think the rest of the series has the potential to be very good. I do recommend Eragon, unless you are the kind of person who will only read highly original and imaginitive books. Eragon is exciting and enjoyable and I look forward to the next book in the series."
5,in case you one-stareres are to DUMB to realize...,Tolkien DID NOT copyright OR invent the ELVES!!!! OTHER PEOPLE ARE ALLOWED TO WRITE ABOUT THEM!!! Just becasue you're to much of a DUMB TURD to realize this doesn't mean you can slam the book. CURSE YOU TO....
5,Book=great. Movie=not so great.,"I thought this book was great. I know there's a lot of people who down it, but I loved it. I felt attached to the characters, and I liked the story itself very much. My only advice: don't go see the movie. It ruins the story... completely ruins it. It doesn't do the book justice one bit."
3,A Little Iffy,"Eragon is your basic story about a young hero in a fantasy world, ruled by evil. A young boy just happens to find a rock that turns into a dragon egg. Okay, I can accept that. But a mysterious man who can do magic, knows a lot about dragons, can fight, and yet refuses to speak of his past? I mean, come on! That just reeks of a dead giveaway! Paolini has a great storyline, if a not very original one, but he needs to vary his approach to the main character and his problems a little better."
2,Bland!,"Paolini is a very talented author but the idea of his book is over-used. Oh my god, a kid finds a dragon and then must fight the forces of evil. That is so original. Paolini should stop wasting his time and write something worth reading. If you are looking for serious fantasy read Abarat. If you are into Sci-fi read Stars my Destination."
4,predictable...yet good,"This book reads like those of the Harry Potter series, I couldn't put it down. Though a predictable plotline and characters it is a break from heavier books like Lord of the Rings. I would reccomend this book to anyone who is interested in fantasy literature or people who are new to the genre."
5,Eragon,"Eragon, by Chrisopher Paloani is a great book for kids ages seven to adulthood. Because it is cool gfdfghjkuyhgdfvbnmkikuj. hgffghj yhgfgh"
1,"boring and, well, boring.","I believe that my title says it all but I will add a little more. If you have read this book you might have noticed that the main charactor, Eragon, is knocked out during all but one battle scene. From this I conclude that the author is a wimp and is too frightened to write out the details of a battle. Don't read this book and read the Tolkien books instead."
4,Read the whole series before stopping!!!!!,"Yes, I admit it did copy some things from great writers but almost every book I have read has had some copying!!For example The Hunger Games copied Battle Royale and still The Hunger Games is one of the most popular books!I am a big fan of J.R.R Tolkien, but seriously hating on Eragon because it has Elves and Dwarves? Almost every fantasy has that!!!!!!!!! And seriously, because there was one book about a person who rides dragon and has magic powers doesn't mean a book like that shouldn't be made again. Gosh guys, you are sounding like Apple when they said they invented the black square with rounded corners (which they didn't, in fact 99% of their ideas were copied)...The book Eragon is a pretty good book 4 out of 5 stars. The who series is 5 out of 5 stars because there is little/no copying in the other books that I could point out.Seriously read the whole series and you will see that there is barely any copying, plus it is an awesome adventure story..."
1,Biggest hoax of all time!,"This is a hoax! This book was not written by a fifteen year old boy! There are things about writing a good book that take years to get just right that no teenager would know. Plus, Christopher's father just happened to be in the publishing business, which tells me that he is the one that wrote it.I'm sure Christopher is old enough now to write his own books, so go ahead and read the later editions with confidence! Until then, try reading Adventures With Boys 5 Dragons Versus Dinosaurs!"
4,Impressive...,"The description of the world this story takes place, I think, is the best part of this book. Paolini has a knack for describing the towns and countryside of this world. I also found this book to be an easy book to read and get through. Eragon, as a character, is presented beautifully.I highly recommend this book to anyone from young adults to adults."
4,Enjoyable,"I really enjoyed reading this work. I admire Chris Paolini for having the determination to tackle such a monumental task. Get over the name similarities, and the Tolkien comparisons - it just doesn't matter. Chris has created a terrific atory, and I am looking forward to Eldest."
2,THIS IS A CHILDREN'S BOOK,"I like to think I have read a lot of books in my day, and the most important thing to keep in mind when reading something is know the context of what is being written, make no mistake, this book was written for people too immature to read Harry Potter. The plot and characters are underdeveloped. The whole thing is a huge Tolkien ripoff (but so is most Fantasy). This book is for first time fantasy readers who are 8 to 12. But before reading this i would recomend reading Harry Potter and the Wheel Of Time so you have and idea of what good Fantasy is.i will admit it was entertaining but anyone who gives this 5 stars needs to read a Game of Thrones by George RR Martin and know what quality fantasy is. This is not quality, it is some kid trying to scrape money together to pay for college and taking the easy way out without making his book worth reading."
5,The Best Book Ever!!,"Eragon, By Christopher Paolini, is an outstanding book. You can never skip a page, for fear that a crucial link will be found. This book is a riveting novel. The description is so complete that you feel you are really there. Very hard to believe the author was only 15.Eragon is the first part in a series of books that tell the story of Eragon, a young boy who discovers a blue stone that is actually a dragon egg. Soon, the egg hatches. Eragon soon names her Saphira. Together, with an old storyteller, they embark on a quest to avenge his uncle's death. On the way, Eragon discovers his power within."
1,Don't let the rave reviews fool you!,"Like many, our family bought this book and the next based on the glowing reviews of the many readers. Unfortunately, we were in for quite a shock as these are the most unimaginative, poorly written books ever published. At Borders where I returned all four books we purchased (2 copies of Eragon and 2 of Eldest), there was a pile of returned copies of Eldest behind the counter. I was in fact unable to get a refund, instead I got store credit on a gift card.Eragon is an uninspiring story chock full of tired, overused characters. The prose is unimaginative, very wordy, and fails miserably on all levels. Each characters talks just like every other character. I don't know why everyone said this book was so good. My kids are in tears. Thanks a lot Chris Paolini for ruining our last week of summer break!"
4,Wonderful way to escape reality...,"Normally I take a few chapters to get into my book settings, this one was different. It took but a few pages and I was reviewing the maps located in the front and back, trying to see where I was being taken, and the terrane in discussion.This is a very fine book to work with your imagination!"
5,FABULOUS!!,"After not reading for a few years, I sat down one weekend and read the entire book - over 500 pages, stopping only to let the cats out and walk the dog! It was amazing! I have also just finished Book 2 - Eldest and am so looking forward to the final book of the trilogy! Hope it comes out soon. If you are a dragon lover, these books are for you! Enjoy!!"
4,Loved it!,"Quite the intricately made book. Possibly the next hype for all people of all ages since the 1st Harry Potter came out. Why? Because it's a GREAT BOOK!The one problem I had with this book is the actual writing of the book. I mean, Christopher started writing this when he was only fifteen years old. So, it was kinda expected that the way the book was written would be inexperienced. But, hey, every writer gets BETTER. I'm sure he'll do a better job with the next book.I was still engaged by every moment of this book. If you have not read this yet, go to the store and buy it. You will not be disappointed."
4,No relation to LOTR whatsoever!,"Eragon has NOTHING to do with The Lord of the Rings! It is a different book! The story is completely different and has a much greater resemblance to Star Wars than it does LOTR. The use and definition of ""magic"" is the most obvious difference between Eragon and The Lord of the Rings, and anyone who knows anything about LOTR would know this. In Eragon, magic is a palpable, outwardly manipulated thing. In LOTR it is subtle... I can't explain it. Read both books and A. You are a complete and utter moron or B. The differences will be completely obvious.Eragon was a solid and enjoyable book and I am eagerly anticipating the sequel. It was well-written and fast-paced and drew me into a rich, complete, and cleverly spun world. The book would be five stars if not for the obvious parallels with Star Wars. No big. It was still a great book well worth reading, even if secondary bad guy turned out to be the secondary good guy's father."
5,Perfect Book,This is the best book I have ever read. I think it's better than all the Harry Potter books combined. I'm usaully not a big reader but I just couldn't put this book down. If your looking for a good fantasy book with elves dragons dwarves magic and alot of action this is the book for you.
1,Sometimes the truth hurts,"Finally the truth about Eragon is out, it's terrible! As far as a Paolini Haters club, I don't think there is one, but there probably should be dozens of them. My friends hate this book. I hate this book. We hate it for the same reason it's really really really really really really bad. Sometimes the truth hurts but it's good so many people have finally realized Eragon sucks!"
2,Nothing special,"I was looking forward to this after being told by a few people how great it was. Three of those were my own teenage kids, and the other was someone who hasn't read much Fantasy. I even waited until the third one came out before starting, so that I could go through the whole series.Unfortunately, after forcing myself to finish the first book, I won't be bothering with the rest. As others have said, it is very same-ish to a lot of much-better books out there. The writing is good for a 15 year old, I suppose, but nothing special. In fact it is a little tedious. At the end of the book, I couldn't even bring myself to have any empathy for any of the characters. I didn't especially like Eragon, or Saphira (who I found very dull). And the villains aren't especially noteworthy either. Worse is that there wasn't a single original idea in the book. It really was a chore to read.Sorry. I wanted to like it."
4,Children will enjoy,"My son read Eragon when he was 11 and had a great time. I previewed the book and it is written pretty well, but I think most adults will find the story too predictable. However, younger people should enjoy it."
4,Impressive!,"What can I say? I see why it's a best seller. The entire series is captivating and compelling. It's too bad that they didn't make movies based on the rest of the books in this series - I think it was drowned out by Harry Potter mania, which is too bad because this is brilliant work. Highly recommended!"
1,Stupid. That's all I can say.,"Well, not really. I hate the book for all the classic reasons.1. Ripoffs, of course2. I've seen better character development in Garfield3. The Old Language words sound like the gibberish that someone would make up when they're losing at Scrabble.4. Dialogue sucks. You can tell Paolini would sit and stare at the computer for long moments, trying to figure out what to say next.5. Too many chapters involve Eragon losing consciousness. The almighty Dragon Rider has never finished a fight!6. Eragon learns about swordsmanship and magic too quickly. Saphira becomes mature too quickly.7. I'd go on, but I've gotta go. C YA!"
1,DISGUSTING,"AHHH, after reading the Dying Earth by Jack Vance isn't this a letdown!!!My grandma gave this to me on my 13th birthday, and i've barely finished half and it's about time i've finally gotten rid of this dumb thing. The characterizations are bad, the plot tedious and the whole book can be summarized sitting in the middle of an ocean listening to doldrums and eels nip out your eyes."
3,Paolini needs some writing classes --,"The story is enjoyable enough in a skim-through, don't-pay-too-much-attention, don't-think-too-hard sort of way. Yes, it is extremely derivative of older and much better literature. But IMHO the real problem is the awkwardness of the prose. I can forgive a lot of literary thievery, if it is done with grace, but grace is sadly lacking here. This book reads as though it was written by a teenager -- guess why.Paolini needs to mature, go to college, see the world, and take some creative writing courses. Unfortunately, his current success may convince him that he doesn't need to improve. And that would be a shame."
1,Get a thesaurus...or maybe two.,"This book was one of the the most unoriginal pieces of fiction I have ever read. Granted, it's pretty long great for a 17 yr. old, but it pales in comparison against the originals. About 1.3 way into reading this, I was wondering if I was reading a kid proof version of LOTR with dragons mixed in for fun.This book had the potential to be great, but it fell flat. The movie could have given the book some positives as well, but it was worse than the book and that's saying something.I know that if I tried to write an epic adventure story, I wouldn't be able to. At least mine would have better grammar and word choice.This book also bothered me because he made no effort to make the writing interesting. I like reading about the character's reactions and emotions. That improves the story vastly. I'd rather have chraracters that are alive in a bad plot instead of flat characters in an unoriginal story."
2,Mildly interesting at best.,"This book is really just formula fantasy. There is nothing really new or original in this book. The language is stilted at times and forced. Similes are often ""off."" The book is ""unrealistic"" at times - and by that I mean given its own frame of reference. For example, Eragon becomes a world class swordsman in a couple of months?! Saphira is depicted as a powerful dragon and displays this at times, yet cannot carry 3 people?! There are other little errors as well that just show the superficiality of the book; for example, the weather is described as cloudy then moments later, they are viewing the stars for navigation. Eragon himself is a superficial character: I never got to actually care what happens to him. I love fantasy so I read the entire book, but I have no interest in reading the subsequent books."
5,Eragon is great!!!!!,I love this book! It is sooooo cool! I highly recommend it to people who like good books!!!!!!
5,Eragon (Inheritance audio) review,I loved the audio book. I listen to audio books on my drive into work and back. It was very well spoken and I enjoyed listening and imaging all of the different scenes. Thanks for making this book available. :-)
1,Not worth the money,"I've read hundreds of fantasy books and this is definitely the worst I've had the misfortune to read. Instead of reading this poorly conceived knock-off, I recommend that young readers check out Anne McCaffrey's Dragonsong trilogy, Ursula Le Guin's Earthsea series, Lloyd Alexander's Chronicles of Prydain series, Susan Cooper's The Dark is Rising series, or if you like SciFi, Orson Scott Card's Ender's Game series.I found Eragon to be a simplistic reworking of stories/themes. It is sad that the publisher's of the 21st century are playing it ""safe"", like most modern entertainment, and giving us nothing new. I was surprised that Anne McCaffrey endorsed this book. She writes ""pulp fiction"" fantasy too, but hers is much better. He even takes the name ""Eragon"", which is very similar to a character in her book, The Skies of Pern, named Erragon.I've never returned a book for my money back, so this was a first."
2,Doesn't flow,"Eragon's got too many ""tacked on"" parts. For example, when Angela's explaining shades, she says ""it's the most unholy magic...EXCEPT NECROMANCY"" Where did the mention of necromancy come from? It is completely off topic. It's as if Paolini mentioned it simply for the sake of mentioning it.Another problem is the slave trade. Paolini tries to make it seem cruel, but the slave trade has no real part in the story. It exists for no reason other than making the Empire more dislikable.Too much of this book feels perfunctory, as if Paolini added it in simply because he thought he was supposed to."
1,I don't get the hype!,"Okay, I know this book was written by a teenager and, yes, it's a pretty great accomplishment for a kid to write something that long and intricate. But if you just read the book for the book, it's so boring and long and chock full of endless, pointless description that nothing ever happens! I like some action in my fantasy novels, people!I was so bored and unenchanted I didn't finish it. And I can only say that about two other books I've read in my life. And I've read alot."
2,Anyone for Tolkien?,"Paolini obviously took a lot of this book from The Lord of the Rings. Tolkien created a masterpiece fifty years ago, but copies don't cut it. Tolkien was Tolkien, but the way Paolini writes Paolini is Tolkien. As far as teen writers go, this book was all right, but like the other reviews say: CLICHES AND LOTR! If you want some good fantasy take The Lord of the Rings, The Hobbit, The Silmarillion, The Eye of the World and ORIGINAL ideas, not an author taking credit for other author's works."
3,Cliche Fantasy,"As I read the story, I became stunned that this book rose to number one on the NYT best-selling list. Paolini's story is intriguing, but every bit cliched. As for writing, he has some very fine points, but too many of sentences are awkward. The dialogue at times feels like the author is talking as opposed to the characters. ""People rarely converse in sophisticated manners much akin to this sentence."""
3,Star Wars?,"After reading 100+ pages...my thoughts are, I've already seen Star Wars - A New Hope.A young boy destined for something greater, a wise older man who helps him along. Those that raise him, aren't his true parents, and their home is destroyed and burned, killing the family member as a result.It's not hard to see where the outline came from.The writing is not as good as Feist or Rosenberg, but it is some entertainment while I wait for a good book to come out."
2,Just plain bad,Funny how if you don't agree with the minority who are hyping this book you are some kind of monster. The real monster is this book. I can't for the life of me see why anyone would say this is a good book. And yeppers do my little brother was crying too with great disappointment after spending his monthly allowance on them books. Me I was just mad as heck. It is a total waste of time. Not worth it.
4,"Dragons, dragons, and more dragons.","The title of this book is Eragon, it was written by Christopher Paolini. The two main characters are Eragon, a brave young boy with powers beyond his wildest dreams, and Saphira, Eragon's dragon and best friend. Together they face dreaded Urgals; survive scorching deserts; and save a nation, known as the Varden. This story is set in the fictional land of Alagaesia. Alagaesia is an empire with many rivers, plains, mountains, and deserts. This story was so readable because of its ongoing theme that you will always prevail if you stay true to your heart, your friends, and your dragon."
4,My opinions...,"Eragon is a story about a boy, a dragon, and magic. Eragon was out in the woods, hunting, when he hears and feels a violent wind. When he opens his eyes, in front of him lays a beautiful blue stone, or so he thinks. After many failed attempts to trade it for family necessities, he gives up and simply leaves it alone. But one night the blue stone hatches, and a baby dragon appears. They go on all sorts of adventures together, find out things they never even dreamed of, and discover secrets.Although some of the previous reviews were rather harsh, I agree somewhat with them. Eragon does have a familiar ring to it, from the plot all the way down to his name. However, unlike the other reviews, I rather thought the story was oddly comforting. Christopher Paolini seems to have taken the best of all other fantasy books, put them together, and put a fresh twist into the plot. I enjoyed reading Eragon and I do recommend it to you."
4,A Surprise!,"While I don't profess to be an expert on Sci-Fi/Fantasy novels, I did enjoy this book. My husband and I have created a habit of me reading aloud to him in the evenings. We started just before HP6 came out, going through the whole series in just over two months. Since we have finished that I have been looking for another series to read to him. One of our 17-year- old's friends let me borrow Eragon, knowing of our tradition and liking for this style of reading. Despite the sometimes juvenile feel, it was a wonderfully cozy book. Congratulations to Mr. Paolini for his courage to write his book. Who better to write a book about a young man coming of age while having to make adult decisions, than a young man.To those critics who don't like it, fine. Just remember, he will only get better with time and experience. Give him a chance."
1,"I have ""A NEW HOPE"" for your book Paolini","Thats right, ""A New Hope"" from Star Wars. Paolini did little more than copy the plotline of Star Wars exactly. He is also the only one I know who uses 7,000 synonems for said. This is amatuer work. This book is not up to the game. Poor and overrated. Two thumbs down and one star."
1,Whatever happened to punctuation?,"The author of this book clearly needs to go back to 9th grade English. This book came highly recommended, but I was unable to get past the first chapter as I was continually distracted by punctuation errors. Commas appeared in the oddest places, and did not appear in the places where they should have been. And am I the only person left who remembers the semi-colon?I understand the author is ""only seventeen"". I assumed his editor would be older and better educated. Perhaps I was wrong in this assumption."
1,i agree with all the other one and two star reviewers,amazon has this great feature where you can select all the one star reviews. i did and was gratified by all the creative nd the original ways people said what amounts to the same thing.unlike the author of eragon the readers are creative and interesting. yeah the book has a greeat cover but that has nothing whatsoever to do with whats inside. you have to be really young or have lived in a cave to miss the fact that paolini copied and copied . plus he just doesn't have what it takes yet to write a good book. the hype is kinda difficult to believe on this one. a waste of money and a waste of time pretty much sums it up.
1,Cliche epic fantasy,I'm not surprised a teenager wrote this book. The book was very cliche and the plot and characters have been seen in countless fantasy novels published before. The romance was weak the the danger so brooding as to be dull. Avoid this work.
1,You Can Run But You Can't Hide,This book is a rip off the famous Star Wars Saga. I cant stand it. It also borrows a few ideas from the Dragon Riders of Pern and Lord of the Rings. It may have been an enjoyable read but still pathetic.
3,Nice ideas but rough edges,"The main ideas were new and interesting. The idea of finding an egg, the dragon choosing its partner were inspired. Some of the characters had some interesting features. Brom's knowledge of magic but not being a ""master"" magician was a good change, more real than the more common Tolkien or Brooks approach. On the other hand, the plot was entirely linear. The kid plods from one episode to another. There is nothing going on in parallel. Nothing unexpected or hidden secrets encountered. The book gets a bit slow. The final duel with the sorcerer was anticlimatic. I liked the link to the elfin magic user while the kid was in his delerium, so am going to give the second book a shot."
4,A great read!,"A great read!I truly enjoyed reading this It's a rarity these days to find an author capable of such good storytelling. The story is well written and very engaging, and despite the fact that it lost some momentum in the middle, I found myself eagerly turning pages to find out what would happen next. All in all, though this is not quite a perfect novel, it comes close."
4,excellent effort,"Having written fiction since I was 7 (that's 80 years ago), I am impressed by what this young man has achieved. It's not great literature, nor even particularly original, but it's an excellent start. I couldn't have done as well at his age; and I'm a dam' good writer."
3,Good but not great,"I tried reading this book becasue it was so popular and I wanted to see what all the hype was about. Turns out not too much. The story is good but it is almost like a combination of all the classic fantasy stories.It is highly similair to Lord of the Rings in my opion and I was also reminded of The Wrinkle in Time series. I like the new takes on old ideas but the plot is really cliche and most of the charcters can be found in any fantasy novel. It is almost like a blueprint for fantasy novels.Of course the main character has parents that no one anything about, and that the main character has a great destiny before him. how many times have we heard this story? i mean come on the beginning chapters are almost straight out of Star Wars.The book looks cool but the story is anything but."
2,hard to decide,"when you pick up this book you do get a pretty good story...but you quickly feel like like you've read this story before. it's an impressive story for a young man, but it lacks hard work and originality...like he took the ideas of better writers, combined them, and then called them his own. when i was new to books like this eragon seemed very impressive, but with a better developed taste and appreciation for good and original stories this book has become more and more distasteful.this book may be a decent starting point for young readers but as the series go on the increase of violence, the decline of eragon'a likability, and the increasing sense that this is nothing more than glorified plagiarism makes this book become less and less decent for any reader"
2,"not great, but not terrible","Ok it was pretty derivative, although I admit I never clued in on the Star Wars similarities until I read some reviews. And the writing was pretty pedestrian. But I did enjoy it and that has to count for something. A good introduction to the genre for young readers? yeah I think so."
3,Average... Obviously not up to HP standards...,"'Eragon' has been written by Christopher Paolini at the age of 17...Quite impressive for a 17-year-old, one would say, but there are always editors involved...!The concept is just another usual medieval-age based story with mythology involved although the plot might be satisfactory. The writing style is fine, but has a big overload of unnecessary details. The characters are well shaped and fit into their class well. The storyline is well-shaped and seems to be well thought of beforehand. Not much suspense involved as the story is mostly predictable.I have mixed thoughts about reading 'Eldest', but I might give it a try. Hope it isnt worse....Rating: 5.6 / 10"
4,Spoiler alert,This book was awesome. I would only give it four stars because the others were so amazing. I didn't know that the author was only fifteen when the book was written when I read the book. The story was about eregon ( ra not re) who finds a rock in the Spine. He tries to sell the rock without success. Era-go-n keeps the rock and it hatches. The rock was really a dragon egg. Era-go-n names the dragon Saphira( Saphira is my favorite character).Brom finds out about Saphira. When the evil king finds out about Saphira; he sends the ra'zac to find Era-gon and Saphira. Br-om helps them escape and the rest of the story is about their adventures.
3,Good effort by a young writer,"I always feel sheepish checking out books from the young adult section at the library. However, I am usually rewarded with books like The Last Unicorn, Harry Potter, and The Chronicles of Narnia. After much publicity, I picked up Eragon out of the young adult section hoping for another jewel. Unfortunately, this book does not live up to its hype for it is definitely more suited for young adults. The writing is uncomplicated and lengthy . . . epic proportions without an epic storyline. Paolini's characters are great but the story feels too long and gets rather dull in parts. This isn't a bad book, its just not a great book. I would recomend reading it though, just because the next installment (Eldest)is a fairly good read. The juvinielle feel of Eragon leads way to a more mature Eldest. My hope is that Paolini continues to grow in his third novel."
5,extremely captivating and full of adventure,"I have never been into reading much at all. I was at the local book store and saw the book looked at the back cover and read the print on it. I found it of intrest so i bought it. I started reading it and i could not stop! It was a Shame that i had to go to work. I found the story line to be very intense and full of thought.As well as descriptive. I read the book within a couple of days and then orderd Eldest from amazon. I can't wait to see what happens next. This author although young has a gift to make a reader out of anyone. I am 22 years old, and in aww. I highly recomend this book to anyone regardless of age."
3,"Not original, but still a good read","I was skeptical about reading this book at first, but the story line became more addicting as the book went on. The author used ideas and concepts from the Harry Potter series, Dragon Riders of Pern series, and the Lord of the Ring series. He mixed them together, and out came this book. There were times when I thought the story line was a bit choppy, but it was still a good read. I do plan on reading the next book in the series. I believe Christopher will become a better writer as time goes on."
2,"Author's youth can only excuse it, not save it","I picked this up for a nice break after reading quite a bit of informative non-fiction, knowing that a children's phenomenon would probably be a fun read. And I have absolutely no bias against the children's section; I love it, and think Harry Potter needs to be on the regular best-seller lists. Unfortunately, this one disappoints. Ugh. I struggled to finish.If you think this is a great read, then congratulations on finding the fantasy genre. You can definitely find better, everywhere. I don't mind the lack of originality that most people harp on. At least the tried-and-true plotlines make the story move (thus two stars). But the dialogue sounds like people talk in essay format. I get that Paolini is young, so let's wait until he learns to write and then praise him. After all, youth isn't a literary quality; it's an excuse for lack thereof."
2,Plagiarism... almost.,"This story steals from many classics. I suppose it isn't an exact ripoff but the similarities between this and other classics such as Star Wars, Lord of the Rings and so on are so pitifully obvious. I read this to my kids and certainly they enjoyed it, not recognizing the plots, ideas and so on. I also don't think it was well written, there is never any doubt that Eragon will make it and be just fine. The dialogue is pretty bad.I can only give it two stars and that's because the kids did like it. Taken for what it is, a kids book, it is okay but just barely. It's the plagiarism that is so obvious and sickening. I think he made enough changes for it all to be legal, but it is still pretty pathetic.Kids read this instead :The Hobbit"
2,Flat,"For a 16 year old author, this is an excellent beginning. Given time and experience I am sure Paolini will be someone to watch. However, there is a lack of maturity to the style of this novel which leaves its characters flat and often not very interesting. The main character too often follows advice because someone else ""says so."" As a reader, it is too easy see where the story is headed, who the good/bad guys are and how each conflict is going to be resolved. Eragon, the main character, trusts those who give him advice, and that advice is generally always sound. There is little true suspense and the story is absolutely linear. ""Go here, do this, see so and so, get next quest, do it, etc."""
2,Not especially original...no sparkle,"Was really looking forward to this, but am disappointed. Have been trying to finish it off and on for about six months but it never pulls me in.The writing plods and the storylines are derivative....not much original here.It's inoffensive--and certainly not awful--but nothing special. I imagine that the marketing prospects due to the author's young age drove the acquisition of this title by its publisher."
3,Not Bad.....,"This book is predictable to a extent, especially if your familar with Tolkeins work and with The Dragonriders of Pern. Mix with a twinge of Star Wars for full effect. The book is intersting enough to keep at it. Its a good start to a series which I hope breaks free of the standard fantasy sterotypes."
4,An entertaining read,"Is it the same world that others made up? Yes, that's true. There's little originality in Eragon's universe.Is the prose below the level of Tolkien? Obviously. It is on par with Robert Jordan, which I think is decent enough, as Eragon is merely another fantasy novel and not an epic work.Is the plot completely and utterly predictable? It is so predictable that the complete plotline of the entire trilogy is spelled out in a fortune-telling early on.But is it entertaining? Yes!If you can settle for the penultimate.. if you can enjoy a book for its vividness and adventure, even if it wasn't written by an Oxford scholar... then you will love Eragon. It is not /Lord of the Rings/-- it is /Harry Potter/."
5,Couldn't Put It Down,"...I wanted to read Eragon so much I didn't want to put it down to do my homework. [That is NOT like me!] I think the author did a great job! My grandma gave it to me a week ago and I didn't put it down until five days later, when I finished it. All of my friends think I am nuts for reading costently and not playing, but they haven't read it. I could only say that a few books are equally good. When you read Eragon, in the middle you find yourself in suspenion and can't get out of it until the very end. I hope Eldest comes out soon! [Meanig in the next few days!] I was shocked at times, wishing the next event would have been more surprising at others. I thought it was cool that there was a glossery in the back! I've been trying to covince my friends to read it, but they are to stubborn. I know I must have said this a thousand times, but I LOVE this book!!!"
3,A Good Start for a good writer,"This book is pretty good, but you can tell that he has taken a lot off of other fantasy writers like Tolkien, but it is still a pretty good book. Hopefully he can improve on the sequels and make the series a memorable one."
2,"good writers borrow, greater writers steal proven wrong","I give Paolini props for writing a long and relatively complex book at such a young age and his love of fantasy stories come through, but all he really does is steal and assemble concepts from better stories. An exiled mentor (Star Wars), Dragon/rider imprinting (Dragonriders of Pern), Elves (Lord of the Rings), Magic (The Wizard of Earthsea) are among several I can think of. Other than his one concept that a person should always make up their own mind, which I appreciated, I think he overall failed to add a different perspective, or unique vision to the realm of fantasy.What I find ironic is the indignance of reviewers who complain about the movie's failure in retelling the story. I will save the remaining books and the DVD for the library."
2,"Long, long ago in a galaxy far, far away... wait, wrong series",I'm surprised that nobody was ever told to use the force.
1,Fantasy For Dummies,"I found Eragon to be a very basic, bare-bones fantasy story. The way I see it, the basic structure of a fantasy plot is like a skeleton and it is the author's job to give those bones flesh. However, Paolini failed to do this and his book is the perfect example of a stereotypical fantasy. It seems as if Paolini was writing Eragon the way he thought it SHOULD be written rather than letting himself write his own story. This book might be useful as a first-timer's introduction to fantasy but as an actual work of literature, it's just not good."
2,Great fan-fiction.,"Not, however, a great novel. It's quality stuff that I'd expect to read on an Internet forum somewhere, but I'm unhappy that I paid money for it in book form.If I wanted to read Tolkien's and LeGuin's stories, I would have gone straight to their books. If I wanted to read an impressive book from a teenage author, I'd have opened up ""The Neon Bible"" by John Kennedy Toole again. ""Eragon"" isn't the first choice in any of these categories, though.I admire the young writer for his discipline in pumping out books of such length. My second star is for that talent. It's a sign that he has a long writing career ahead of him. Like other reviewers have said, I'll check him out again in a decade or so when he starts writing his own things instead of fan-fiction paeans to his favorite writers."
2,"It's passable, but just barely","Eragon was entertaining enough, but that's the only thing it's got going for it. It's not the kind of book that people will remember for years. It's just the book you'd pull out of your backpack if you have some spare time at school.Eragon was okay, but it has no ""soul."" What I'm saying is that there's nothing to make Eragon into a unique, individual book. It's just a combination of different books. I saw more Tokien, McCaffrey, and LeGuin than Paolini in this book. There is nothing of Paolini's own ideas in Eragon."
1,A Conceited Attempt at Literature,"I tried to finish this book. I really did. But, as a lover of books, I decided that this story was not for me. The author is obviously an amateur, and would do very well in a high school English class. However, his home-school background shows through the flaking veneer of this unrelatable book. His sentence structure is amazingly halted, unable to flow like a quality piece of literature. Making my attempt to read this book all the less enjoyable is the author's precocious vocabulary, needless proper names and jargon, and endless simile and metaphor that fills the pages. This book is less than the quality literature that I would expect from Knoph Publishers and is merely a lengthy oddity, not an odyssey, written by a young but hardly gifted author.Robert Goodhue Woodruff"
3,Mother & Son .....Differing Opinions,"My 9/10 year old and I read this book together last year and he LOVED it. The story moves quickly, the characters are accessible, and before the last paragraph ended, my son couldn't wait to discover what would happen in Eldest (the sequel).I 'enjoyed' the story as well, but the influences from Tolkein and other writers is painfully obvious. Also the story lacks depth, which may be a reflection on the writer's age. I would like this to be better than it is, but would nevertheless recommend it to other children aged 8-12."
5,"Couldn't put this one down, read it in 3 days","I started reading this book in the car during our Thanksgiving trip and continued reading it until I finished it once we arrived. I finished all the Harry Potter series, and although this book takes longer to get into the action, once it does its great! I like how the boy starts learning stuff, even though he is a normal boy just like me. I would love to read the next book in this series ELDEST, but its not published yet."
5,A great book for dragon fans everywhere,"This is a great book. Written well, especially by someone so new to the writing business. He clearly has talent, and the book is well written. The book may have a resemblance to other famous works, but the way that all of these elements go together in Eragon keeps readers reading long after dark.It has all of the elements essential to a good book, humor, adventure, mystery, and even a little romance. The story tells of a boy, just old enough to realize that there is more to life than just his little home.Eragon has many adventures, and the story is long, yet not too long. As I finished the last pages of the book I found myself wishing I hadn't read it so fast.All in all, this book is well worth the read, with a good plot for people of all ages. I will eagerly be awaiting Eldest, book two."
1,:(,Well I have been waiting a couple of months to receive this book. and have yet to do so. I am hopping I can contact the seller soon so I can finally get it. But we'll just have to see. Very disappointed in not getting this book yet :(
4,An entertaining novel by all standards,"While this book has many similarities to the the works of other writers, it maintains its own appeal. Readers of Tolkien will most definitely recognize some of the names, characterizations, and storylines located throughout the book. It is a realatively easy read and an enjoyable book despite its many refrences. I personally found it hard not to be strongly reminded of Tolkien constantly. It is certainly a book for those not quite ready to take up Tolkien's heavy volumes. I praise the work of Christopher Paolini and look forward to reading is next book."
3,EXCELLENT READ,"This is an awesome book. It is a little boring at first, but speeds up as soon as you get into it really. I kept flipping back through the book and I thought ""Ohh. THAT'S what that was/why that happened."" Paolini is good at suspense, and a good writer. He got 3 stars because for my age group, it'd be hard to read. The book is about a kid named Eragon. He finds a dragon egg in the woods and goes on a quest to find the elves. It is reminiscent of LOTR, but with it's own twist. It's got some old, much-used characterisitics, but still manages to be original. I almost gave this a four star, but as I said, it'd be too hard for my age group. Oh, by the way, did I mention my age group is 10-12? Yeah. I'm 11."
5,Best book in the universe and no dought about that,"This book was written in a great way. The author keeps you imprisined and you can't get away. I fell in love with the caractors right away.I don't know what it is, but Christopher Paolini had me reading this book all night from 7p.m. to 6a.m. just to find out how it ends. Because of that I was late for school and got a F- on my test because I all i did was write my name and then I fell asleep and I slept, from 9a.m.-12p.m., utill lunch. But I didn't care because I finished the best book ever.You may think this book was predictable, but it wasn't compared to other books. For example in The Lord of the Rings Frodo was obviously going to deystroy the ring, Aragon was going to become king, and eveyone would live happily ever after. And also, people say this book is just like the Lord of the Rings well most action fantasys are, but who cares as long as it's a good book. Superb work Christopher Paolini! I give you an A+! Keep it up!"
2,Time for Credibility/Reality check??,"The reason people claim to love this book is because it was supposedly written by a kid. Definitely time for some truth in martketing Knopf. Paolini is at this time 22 years old. If I do the math and go back 2 years that makes him 19 or 20 when Eragon was published. A 19 year old is not a kid. So why market this book as written by a kid? Only reason I can figure is since the book could not be sold otherwise. As for litery quality or merit this book has none. I didn't dislike it due to the fact it was derivative. I disliked it because it was contrived, poorly written, and lacking any redeeming quality. Parents before letting your kids read this think twice about the poor example being set."
1,Not enjoyable,"They say that I should like this book. I love J.K Rowling and J.R.R. Tolkien - the perfect gift you'd expect. However, as I read the first chapters, I found myself being needled with the feeling that I had read something similiar before, and it was better then. As I read more, I became bored with the whole thing. The whole thing was so predictable and unoriginal. I thought it sounded like a English class fantasy assignment gone crazy. I have read books that definitely took ideas from other ""original"" fantasy authors and managed to like them a little. But in Eragon, it was so OBVIOUS. Overall, I thought it was something you'd praise on the fanfiction level, but it shouldn't of been published. Glad I borrowed it instead of buying it."
1,Star Wars meets LOTR,"Star Wars with no technology and Tolkien with no wisdom. What could be better? Add some of McCaffrey's dragonriders and David Eddings special marks. . .if Paolini is 'new guard' and those original writers are 'old guard', why does the 'new guard' have to use the plots and ideas of the 'old guard'? Seems like the new guard would belong to the ones with the original ideas, past, present, and future.Fantasy readers are, by and large, pretty intelligent. We can put up with a lot of crossover from the authors we read, so long as there is an original twist. We can't be told that a book like Eragon is original and new, because we know better. Even the names are Tolkien's with some letters rearranged. Or should I say Tolkein."
4,Good,The book arrived on time but it was a little more beat up than I anticipated. Definitely still readable but the cover was a little messed up.
2,Unoriginal...dissappointing,"This was a dissapointing book. It was a rip-off of the lord of the rings--even the note at the end is like lord of the rings (""may your swords stay sharp"") the language Paolini made up is unoriginal and is just like what the elves speak in the Hobbit. Every time Eragon got into a conflict, he went unconscious and appeared somewhere safe when he woke up. He goes unconscious in almost every chapter and there is only one main plot line--no mini twists or turns--altogether it was pretty predictable. And even the main character's name, Eragon, sounds just like Araghorn from LOTR."
2,B.O.R.I.N.G!,I think this book was horrible! I only give credit to the begining of the book and the author for being young. I was really hooked with it in the begining but it just became boring. It was the same stuff over and over again. It was like you could predict what was going to happen. I only read up to a page in the 230's and found out ho the book ended by my friend and it was just as i predicted. I would recomend this book to people who are really having a bad day and want to read a really bad book. :(!
2,crap book,who even bealives in dragons the book us ok though.really why would a fifteen yearold farm kid become the chosen one.
1,*Barf*,"How can anyone call this a book? I hate this book! I wish there was a -5, because this book is boring, pointless, and ill-concieved. I will not so much as look at Paolini's next book."
4,Not an epic.... yet.,"A bit choppy in places, especially the beginning, but I am excited to see Christopher develop into a mature writer over the years. He is most definitely a new voice in fantasy even though the stores stock his books in the ""young adults"" section. As an avid reader of scifi and fantasy I still enjoyed the story and believe we will see more from Mr. Paolini."
3,entertaining for a young reader,"Maybe this will be a book that will get a child into reading? That being said, if you are a parent and your child likes this book please provide your child with more quality reading than this. Mr. Paolini is obviously precocious and has read a lot of fantasy but he does not have the emotional maturity to develop complex characters. If he had been able to do this, the formulaic writing could be less obvious. I have read a lot of fantasy and junior fantasy myself so I may be more critical than the average Joe. If you get this book and like it, great! Read more books!For example, try the Dark Is Rising series by Susan Cooper. They are within the age group Paolini is aiming for. They are truely wonderful and underrated."
4,Not as bad as some portray...,"As a long time reader of fantasy and science fiction, I'm not sure I understand the complete disgust some of the reviewers are feeling concerning this book. For me, Eragon is a good fill in as my post-LOTR:RotK-high wanes, and I anxiously await the next installment in Jordan's Wheel of Time series. I've read Tolkien, McCaffery, Lackey, Tad Williams, and many others. The fact that many elements are obviously taken from these greater works didn't take any enjoyment away from my reading. Not an epic, I agree, but not a waste of time. For those people who have found books of a Tolkien-esque scale intimidating in their size and vocabulary, I think this is a good start to get into the genre. If you are well aquainted with fantasy novels, this is a nice Saturday afternoon read when you just want to read something for the fun of it."
4,Eragon Book 1,"I am a huge Harry Potter fan and I decided to take a chance on the book that I always see featured next to Harry Potter. I was very happy that I did. I am a preschool teacher, and I read books during nap time every day. Sometimes it is hard to keep the plot line going for days at a time with books, but this book was so riviting that I found myself taking the book home to read at night as well as during nap time. I finished it in record time. And I was also amazed to find out when I finished the book that Christopher Paolini was only 18 years old when he wrote this book. That made it even more amazing to me. So I hope everyone else gives it a chance too, they will be rewarded."
5,That kid is awesome,I love making fun if the kids and that kid who made fun of Mongomerey is right he is an idiot. I really liked this book it had a great story and since he was 15 when he wrote it it was even better
3,"Decent, though there's room for improvement.","I felt that Eragon was a good story, though not my style of fantasy. The writing itself was wonderful. The words had amazing fluidity, while keeping a steady rythm. Although the character developement and plotline left much to be desired, I think the writing style made up for those shortcomings. I intend to read the next one when it comes out. With luck, the author's skill at plot will have improved."
5,Paolini Power,"I loved this new novel. I couldn't put it down!Buy this book if you haven't already, because you are missing out!Long Live Eragon!"
5,Amazing!!,"Eragon is a great book. I was amazed that it was written by someone so young. Some say that it is not original and is just following a ""Tolkien"" layout. This is not so. The idea that a young boy and a young dragon growing up together is quite new. I cannot wait for the next one."
1,This book was edited?,"I won't echo the other comments about how the work is unoriginal or taken from other writers. I didn't care too much about that, mainly because I couldn't get past the horrible use of language. I think this book got caught up in the whole ""the writer's 18 years old!"" hype. Had this book been written by Robert Jordan and published as a Wheel of Time novel, it would have been flambayed.The use of the English language is absolutely horrible, for all the reasons described in the reviews below, and I blame this not on Paolini's education, but on his editors, who failed to clean up this book into something readable. Maybe some of you can get past it, but I couldn't."
1,My Honest Review of Eragon/Eldest,"I read this a few years ago because it was the latest craze. A fifteen year old (who finished it when he was 19) wrote a 550 page book! Most teenagers aren't exactly great writers, so I felt I had to check this out.The book? 550 pages of derivativeness, pointless description (especially that of a certain elf's cleavage), and a carbon copy of Star Wars. For starters, 80% of the book is description of either the terrain or of hot elves, and yet I have no idea what the main character looks like. Not to mention the fact that Paolini obviously wrote it with a thesauras by his side. Machicolated?! We have no idea either. I'm not sure whether that was in Eragon, or Eldest, but what the hey?And then the plot. Yaargh. Take Star Wars, set it in medieval times, replace robots with dragons, and take out any originality. That's basically the plot. And as for Eldest, take everything I said here and multiply it by 5. Yup. It's that bad."
4,Eragon,"I thought this book was exiting, yet slow at times there was action, but the plot is fantastic. I enjoyed reading the book but it gave me nothing to ponder. But a good read for Tolkien fans."
5,A Boy and his great book about Dragons,I had heard about this series since it came out. It became the butt end of a lot of jokes. So I avoided it like the plague. Don't buy into the hate for this book. I picked it up and immediately fell in love with it.Many reviews will tell you that it is just a collection of other story elements from better books. What I found is tried and true fantasy and good old fashioned story telling. It is true that there isn't much new here but who cares if it is entertains.I for one thought it was very good. The plot moves along with a lot of mystery and action. The characters are strong and their motivations are clear. There is always forward momentum making it fun to keep reading well past bed time.So don't worry about how old he was when he wrote it. Just sit back and enjoy the old fashioned kind of fantasy when the good guys where good and the bad guys where bad.
5,Loved it!,"This book is so addicting I finished it in a day. One thing I do not like is how wide ranged Arya's looks are. In the book, she is absolutely beautiful, with black locks. But in the movie, her hair is golden and she somehow doesn't meet my expectations on how the beautiful elf would look like. for another thing, elves have pointy ears and she didn't...That would have been something to add in the movie. to credit Mr. Paolini, think he is very talented. He describes the scenes and its characters well, especially when Saphira's there. To finish, I say, Go Eragon!"
2,Like Coca-Cola Lite- make's you wish for the original,"Eragon, a fantasy tale of a boy who is destined to become the next dragon rider, is an amazingly told story- for a seventeen year old to tell. This story, while it has little inspired plot- shows that the young author will in a few years, become a really promising talent in his field.The problem now is really the problem of youth- he's obviously got so many inspirations which he idolizes, and he wants to put them together in one book, yet he never makes any his own or brings any new material to the story. To be honeset this book was a bit like regurgated material and there was a lack of character development, intersting characters, or good dialouge, but it does show a spark of genius in this young man. A commendable work for a 17 year old, a poor contribution overall to the fantasy genre."
3,"oh, yeah!!!","WOW! This is probabley one of the most thrilling books I've ever read!The young Christopher takes you on a thrilling adventure like no other. This book has the perfect balance of action,and mystery! You fall in love with the characters you meet and realy thoroughly enjoy yourself while reading this wonderful piece of artwork!"
1,EEEEEEEEEEEEEWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I can definitely say that this is one of the worst books ever. How can anybody ignore that Paolini has copied EVERYTHING in this book from either Lord fo the Rings or Star Wars. Oh yeah, and Fristhk knogjkjsh achrojvm. Translation: THINK OF YOUR OWN IDEAS!!!!!!!!!!! Isn't it rather obvious that Arya is Arwen(Even looks like her you know; just a little bit.), Brom is Gandalf, Eragon is Frodo or Aragorn, and Beorn is...Beorn. Oops!Damn! He forgot to change the name!It's nearly impossible to ignore his obvious plagiarism and carbon copying, so I don't know how his editors managed to ignore him. You don't have to waste time reading carbon copies of other books; just read Lord fo the Rings or see Star Wars. Just change a couple of names and a bit of the landscape and...Voila! Eragon!"
4,Eragon a great read for LOTR fans,"Readers who devoured the Lord of the Rings saga will find the plot and characters of this new fantasy very familiar--it follows the formula fairly closely, with an epic quest, a reluctant hero, a diabolical sorcerer villain, and a heroic stand against evil forces. There are even dwarves and elves. This is certainly an amazing debut by this young author, but it lacks the depth and richness of the Lord of the Rings. However, this series shows wonderful promise and is an excellent recommendation for LOTR fans."
1,yuck!,"Wow, I can't believe that somebody actually published this piece of crap. It reads like it was written like a fifteen year old who has read way too much sci-fi/fantasy and not enough of anything else. Reading this book was kind of like driving a square-wheeled car. Ka-chunk Ka-chunk Ka-chunk. It was very slow in most places and the ""made up language"" distracted from the story rather than adding to it. (BTW Tolkien had a PhD in medieval languages, he kind of knew what he was doing). The main part of the action was in the last few pages and things happened almost too quickly and I was forced to re-read several times to grasp what was going on. I hope that the sequel is better, but I'm not ready to waste my time reading it."
1,110% derivative,I liked this book better when it was called Dragonriders of Pern/Star Wars/Lord of the Rings.
1,This book helps your self esteem!,"Personally, I wasn't very impressed. It is a decent adventure story, but it's very predictable and pretty cliche throughout. I will wait and see how the story develops- because it did keep me entertained. I mean, it's not the most original story, but it's a decent eight-hour ride book."
1,Too derivative for the mature fantasy reader,"Novice readers of fantasy love this book. To anyone who has read a lot of fantasy, including young adult fantasy, it is instantly forgetable.Young people should be directed to role models like Christopher Paolini or S. E. Hinton of authors who were published when they were still teenagers, but if you are looking for a better young fantasy writer, introduce them to Amelia Atwater-Rhodes instead. She signed her first publishing contract when she was just 13, I think.Dragon lovers love dragons no matter what and any young fantasy reader who is not already deeply steeped in Tolkien, Feist or McCaffrey will probably love this book."
1,Just one question,"just one question: is there a fantasy writer out there that Mr. Paolini has NOT stolen from? this book has strung together the work of Tolkien, McCaffrey, Robert Jordan, Star Wars, and Dee[ Space Nine, to name a few. it's irritating to me, a teenager, that people are saying the reason the author can't write an original book is because he's a teenager. i disagree. there are plenty of teenagers who can come up with new ideas --he just isn't one of them. why was this book published and given so much hype? i don't know. Tolkien's plot without Tolkien's wisdom is kind of sad. McCaffrey's dragons without originality is sad, too. Jordan's mountains and creatures without Jordan's great writing is really sad. Star Wars and Deep Space Nine mixed in is just lame. well, all i can say is, this book is not worth buying."
4,A Cliff - Hanger,"Amazing that this could be written by a teenager! Not as well-written as Lord of the Rings, but a cliff-hanger none the less for adults and children. My daughter, a phi beta kappa graduate of Yale (and a physician) has read it several times. My ""significant other"", also a physician, tried to listen to it on tape when he was running, but also couldn't put it down, and continued to listen to it while driving, sitting in his home, etc."
3,Not bad for a first book,"I have to agree with many other reviewers that this book lacks a certain maturity of composition. It is well written and tells a great (if cliche) story, but through the, at times gaping, seams one can see the light of other works like Dragonlance, Wheel of Time, Lord of the Rings, and other excellent fantasy novels. At times, the similarities are so thinly veiled that I physically winced and felt slightly embarrassed for having seen through.All in all, this book is an interesting read because it does bring a few new concepts to the fantasy table and Mr. Paolini manages to rework a few old ones in his young style. Those are the bits that kept me reading through to the end and keep me hopeful that this talented young writer's style and voice will mature and he will hire a FAR BETTER editor.It is worth purchasing for a light read, but no new ground is broken in a meaningful way."
4,Eragon review,"Christopher Paolini put together a story of magic, dragons and battles. Eragon is a very good book, but it needs a little more originality because it is kind of copied off of the Chronicles of Narnia and Lord of the Rings. This is a great fantasy book even though he copied a little bit."
4,Captivated,"From page one to the end, I was entranced, enthralled, and extremely impressed. I can't say enough good about this promising author. I just hope to read the next one very soon."
1,An Impressive Epic Fantasy? Puhleeze...,"If you call this epic, think again. All ""Eragon""(Lord of the Rings imitation of Aragorn)and ""Brom"" do is travel through trees and mountains. Epic journey? Nope. Just because the author is 19 or whatever, it's not the best book. My friends hated it, they claim it's an imitation of Lord of the Rings, examples;Elves, Dwarves, wizards, and dragons! THIS IS NOT A CONSCIEDENCE. Elves are spelled exactly the same, as are Dwarves, and their culture is the same too! Dwarves are great miners and craftsmen,they carry axes and chain mail, they're short, stocky, and strong, Elves are beautiful and good at forging swords, and they even have a horse lord, like Shadowfax!! The elf, Arya, is like Arwen, with long dark hair, and yet, Murtagh is like Boromir, with a silver bound horn!!!!!!!! This book is NOT epic, I'm telling you! It's a copycat!"
1,Very poor.,"This was obviously written by an inexperienced author, without much grasp of anything beyond the obvious conventions of the fantasy genre. There is soooooooo much better out there, books with depth, thought, realistic characters I actually care about. Eragon is a sad, shallow entry into the market."
3,A good story but heavily based on other sagas,"A great new saga and world for fantasy fans to get lost in, with the two main characters being a boy and a dragon trying to stay alive under relentless pursuit by a tyrannical emperor while at the same time learning the extent and limitations of their powers. Not a terribly intellectual book, but I think it's a good book to get kids interested in fantasy and then get them hooked on Tolkien and other ""meatier"" fantasy and sci-fi authors."
1,Good or bad?,"I, too am a young author and usually write long stories for my family and friends, all of which are fantasy lovers. I was watching MSNBC news when I saw Paolini being interviewed and just out of curiosity, I bought Eragon and Eldest at the same time. I felt as if I wasn't alone in writing novels and I was comforted. The first few chapters were OK but I was angry and disappointed when Brom died. As I read further I noted that there were some passages from LOTR and SW and Anne McCaffrey's, DragonRiders of Pern in the book and I became angry.It is insignificent that a fifteen year old wrote a novel. It doesn't matter the age of the person...what matters is the book and the words that filled the pages. I do not recommend this book to anybody. I would recommend J.R.R Tolkien's, The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings for those are much better."
1,An achievement.......although,"The fact that a 15 year old wrote this is impressive. However, I felt like I was reading the narration from a computer role playing game, without the fun of being able to direct the action myself. The book makes a fine first draft, but should have gotten alot more work before being published. It doesn't even come close to Harry Potter, much less Tolkien. The only character that really comes off is Saphira, all the others seem like stereotypes. I see a great future for Paolini as a designer of computer role playing games, but writing a novel takes more than just a bald description of the action."
1,Hyped Stock Fantasy -- BEWWARE!,"Just read the whole book and wished that I had not. What a waste of my time. I kept thinking it would get better but it sadly never did. There are so much better fantasy books than this to pick up (I suggest the LOTR or Harry Potter, perhaps Narnia) that this is just the stockest fantasy story I have ever read. Every scene and dialogue is a cliche! BARF!"
4,GREAT I DIDNT KNOW A 17 YEAR OLD COULD WRITE THIS GOOD!!!!,"This is a great book but only problem like a medieval Star wars Father of Eragon(Morzan) destorys the riders like darth vadar destorys jedi :P also rebals and empire :P master dies finds new one Brom knows morzan like Obi wan and Vadar getting point? Good other than that I LOVE THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!(also Eragon and Arya like Aragorn and Elf) *wink* *wink* ;-) GOOD NEWS ERAGON FANS THERE MAKING A MOVIE WILL BE OUT Dec. 15, 2006(only bad part)"
2,"Either you love, or you hate it.","I don't, as you can plainly see. The book was written with poor grammar, and the plot seems very familiar, like so many other books. I wouldn't suggest this book, but you may want to read it anyway to make your own choice. I was expecting another great fantasy author, but I realize that Paloani still has a long way to go.I think it is clearly remarkable that someone Paloani's age could write a novel such as this, though I do not find the book as remarkable. I know that many people absolutely love this book, and indeed I can see why. I would like to encourage Paloani to keep on writing, and to develope his style and better himself through experience, as that is virtually all he is missing at the moment."
2,disappointing,"I bought this for my teenage son so he would have something to read over Thanksgiving. He enjoys fantasy so I thought he would love this book. No such luck. He started reading it. ""The Lonely Mountain?"" he said, kind of snickering. It didn't get any better than that. ""Dad, I can't finish this book,"" he said. ""Just give it to the library."" I did, and consider it a donation. According to my son, he kept seeing things in Eragon that came from other fantasy books he has read. He didn't think much of that."
1,Unoriginal,"Though I am a big fantasy person, I did not enjoy this book. The storyline was very unoriginal, and took so much from Lord of the Rings and Star Wars. Even some of the names are similar. He uses the Tolkien elves (tall, fair, wood-dwelling) and Tolkien dwarves (mountain-dwelling, short and bearded), and his story has some of the same ideas wound all through it. For example, from Star Wars he uses ""the boy who has to fight the Empire."" I would not recommend this book to anyone, especially if you are a huge LOTR or Star Wars fan."
1,"Plagiarism, Plagiarism and......more Plagiarism","This book and its entire series should not be allowed to be sold. Reason:Christopher Paolini has plagiarised all good books known to man. This novels include but are not limited to.""Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, Age of Fire Book Series, and Noviks novels""C.P is just a phony out to milk everyone for their monies but thats ok, I keep a copy of his book beside my toilet incase I run out of toilet paper and would rather casterate myself than read this squished rotting cockroach of a so called ""novel"" . Its Published toilet paper, whats america coming to next? Copyrighted Shows of Extreme Retardation?"
1,Pure fantasy cliche,"I have no idea why this book received such rave reviews. Everything about this story is horribly cliche. Honestly, there is absolutely nothing noteworthy about this book. The tremendous weight of cliche wouldn't have been so bad if the characters weren't flat, the story boring and hard to follow, and the prose dreadful. Edlest isn't any better. Definately a series to skip."
1,same story i have heard a thousnd times,"Wow. Talk about a t, so i have to read this book for my class and can i say the hype was over done. No winder why it madw for suchfg a bad movie. Eragon was just terrible to start with. He takes the plot line of star wars and throws it into a LOTR world and he add a hit of dragons. And guess what all of his ""ideas"" he stole it. He has nothing orgnal to add to the fansty world. Yes authors take from others but they also add a twist to it. Sadly he dosent. Dont read it, biggest wast of my time. Ever. Just dont read it. Your better off"
5,As good as Harry Potter and Lord of The Rings!,"This book was great! I found it as interesting as Harry Potter, or Lord of the rings! I want more! This book ranges from everything from slight romance, to epic battles with ferocious monsters, like urgals, and their giant realatives, kull. It has very intense moments, and anyone who thinks that it stinks obviously has no taste in a good book! Eragon has a dragon, saphira, and uses her to fight the king, Galbotrox's army. Shades, evil and powerful wizards, Raz'ak, deathly birds, and many other fiends challenge him, and his many companions in the book. It is full of tragety, and cheers of victory, and surprises at every turn! This is no doubt one of the best books I've ever read, and with Amazon's great low prices, you can't beat these great deals!"
3,Fun read but nothing new,"I enjoyed reading it. Not completely children story yet not 100% adult one. I think there is too much violance to be a children book.A young man is dragged into an adventure that makes you wonder and read, very fun read. The reason I only gave 3 stars is because, there is nothing new, or breakthrough."
3,Star Wars meets lord of the Rings??,"Borrowing themes from fantasy classics like Tolkien and Science Fiction classics like Star Wars - Eragon was a very enjoyable read. Not impressively original or unique, but very well put together. This is not to say that Paolini fails to impress: he has taken some of the best elements of myths we all love and weaved them into a work that is his own. I very much enjoyed the book, and will definatly follow up with the second volume of the yet-to-be-materialized trilogy. Give us more Christopher - the world needs more fantasy!"
3,Good story,"I think this is a good book with a good story. I find myself interested in the characters and want to read the next in the series. The reason it gets 3 stars is because as lots have said before me, some ideas are taken a little too closely from already established fantasy novels, the emotional lives of the characters could be a little deeper and some of the action is anti-climactic. But it is a good refreshing, light read. It's also good to think of this book as a young person's story. in that light it's fantastic and good for any young person to read... (...)"
2,I trudged through five chapters,"My wife and I read five chapters and just couldn't bring ourselves to read the rest. We just didn't want to waste our time. Others have detailed the book's faults; for us, it was all too clear that the book was written by a young and immature writer."
1,Tolkein Revisited,Ummm...kudos for a teenager writing a book...but the truth is: it sounds like he was channeling Tolkein (and a few other authors as well if I am not mistaken)...and there is no comparison. I guess plagiarism is the highest form of flattery?? Whatever...read the Masters...omit the students..
5,amazing,This book was amazing. in the begining it was a little like lord of the rings but then it was nothing like it. anyone who says this book stinks are crazy. this was the best book i ever read.
2,Not worthy of the hype!,"I purchased and read this book just after it first came out to rave reviews and a New York Times Bestseller ranking. I was extremely dissappointed. There is a reason that there are not many well renowned 18 year old authors out there. The writing is poor at best - definitely the work of someone who is just learning the art. The story is entertaining at times, but as many other reviewers have mentioned, it is entirely unoriginal. This book is fine for the younger child but is not in the class of Paul Park's Princess of Roumania, The Golden Compass trilogy or Harry Potter as books that transcend the line between children's and adult literature. I did not read the second book and have no intention of doing so."
2,A so-so fantasy tale.,"This story was a worthy effort for a 19-year old writer, but he should have worked for another year on the piece before its self-publication. The author utilizes many adjectives, a good tool for describing objects and scenery in a story, but when too many are inserted, especially dull adjectives like ""big, large, round, etc."" a style suffers. Since Christopher is still a very young man and seems to be at a stage in life where writers use their initial success as learning blocks to mature as novelists, I feel we have yet to see the true capabilities of this promising author. Being only 22 years old and a self-published writer myself, I congratulate Christopher for his success in aquiring a book deal with a high paying publishing house. A dream like this comes only to those who persist for achievement in their dreams. Keep on writing, Christopher!"
1,Terrible Writing!,"Well, I may not be qualified to write a review, since I could not read this thing past the first chapter. And so, of course, I really don't know about the plagiarism, but I can tell you it was bad writing. Odd grammar, awkward flow (or rather, no flow), glaring holes in logic, some pretense at being descriptive, childish narration (not the good kind as told through a child's eyes, but something like 'The orange and brown cat drank some white milk and then went to happily to sleep'), and the list goes on. I don't see how anyone could've withstood this to the end.There are times when I don't like a book; I'll put the book down and never touch it again. And for these books, I'll even admit they have some merits and I can see how others could like them. But I don't think I ever threw one in the trash like this one.For this book to even be compared to the works of Tolkien makes my heart bleed. And to think that this shall be recommended to future generations of readers..."
3,What an Adventure,"This was an excellent book. It kept you going. It is about a farm boy which found a saphire rock and was going to exchange it for money for food because his family was very poor. So later on he figures out that it was not a rock but a dragon egg. After wards his family is killed and he finds out that he is one of the last Dragon Riders. So he and his dragon set off on journeys fighting elves, dwarves,the varden, and the evil king Gabatori."
3,A good listen,"I had the pleasure of listening to this book in mp3 format.This book has all sorts of aspects of other stories. As Eragon enters the prison cell of the elf, I recount the prison scene from Star Wars... ""I Luke Skywalker, I came with Ben Kenobi, I am here to rescue you.."".The author is clearly influenced by Tolkien... Nasgul, Lonely mountain, the rohan and a myriad other familiar references riddle this story. The names could be a bit more original.. gets confusing when he is writing about Barad-Dur, I mean ""Farthen Dur""...But this is a fun story. Read it!And more importantly, watch for this author in the future.... I think we can expect some great things from this young man... For he has the mark of the dragon and a special blessing.... =)"
1,Stupid.,"This is the worst book I've ever read. It is a complete copy of much better works of fantasy. Eragon is a totally unlikable weenie, and the rest of the characters are far too underdeveloped to care about. Don't waste your time with this one."
1,Very disappointed,"Like many other reviewers, I bought this book based on the rave reviews here. I totally agree with all the other negative reviews that this book is boring and hard to follow. Finding a new fantasy author is exciting, but Christopher Poopolini will not be added to my list. I won't be reading any more books by this author."
1,Even for a seventeen-year-old....,"This is among the worst fantasy books I have ever read, and it infuriates me that it is getting so much attention. I could possibly forgive the utter lack of ingenuity of its plot or the language, which is more suited for a 7-year-old, if only I saw some signs of the author caring about the quality of his book. Unfortunately, it is obvious for the entire first third of the book that it was not even edited for basic grammar, and I find it insulting."
1,wow...what a disgrace,oh my god. this novel makes me want to eat six lemons and call my mom to tell her i hate cats. this is not in any ways original. what is happening to childrens fiction these days.
2,Meh ...,"This book redefines derriviative. It seems like the sort of fan fiction where the writer goes in to other writers' worlds, kills their dragons, steals their gold, and makes out with their Arwen. This book makes a fine door-stop or paperweight, though (+1 star)."
5,A fun read,"I am rather new to the fantasy genre. Harry Potter, Star Wars, Buffy and Angel are about my limit. So, for anyone new to fantasy, I would recommend this book; it's fast-paced, familiar and easy to read. I would get it on tape first if you want to be able to pronounce all the characters correctly (and languages and spells,etc) I liked this so much I got the second book immediately and liked that even better. Can't wait for the final one. I think long-time fantasy readers wouldn't be as enthused as I am because it is takes so many ideas from some of the more famous series (ie Star Wars) ... but that is what makes it so very comfortable and enjoyable for me to read."
3,A stolen plot,"This isn't a bad story for something written by a 15-yr-old. However, the majority of its plot was stolen from other works of fantasy. Other works of fantasy that were much better written. Don't waste your time reading this when there are far better fantasy books out there."
2,boring and pointless,This is a 'kiddie book' that even my 7 yearold brother won't read. I don't remember when I had ever read a book so boring and pointless.
2,thumbs down,"I think I read this whole book but come to think of it, I can't really remember. I do remember it being slow and dry and by the ending, I couldn't remember the beginning. Not all that much of a fantasy reader to begin with, I could never bring myself to read anything past the first book. I did always think the cover art was pretty though. :)"
1,Ripped off from a video game,"No need to read it, I just saw five minutes of the movie, and it's a total rip-off. Let me explain why; first it starts with an egg, which is probably a good start. However, and this is a big one, if you watch it after that, it clearly states as a rip-off. Has anybody ever played ""Legend of Dragoon"" on Playstation, if you have, then you know what I'm talking about. But if you haven't then let me be brief. Boy finds stone, stone becomes a sourse of power to from a dragon, boy then saves a girl who has a stone of her own that a king wants, and finally boy discovers that his own father is his enemy. You get the picture. Whoever this guy is, should be sued BIG time."
5,An excellent tale,"I think Christopher Paolini does a great job in writing the Eragon books and I think that Gerard Doyle does a great job in dramatising the story. One of the things I like about the book is that Eragon and Brom travel a lot more than in the movie and that you meet a lot of new characters that you don't know from the movie. Two of the characters are my favorite, Orik and Hrothgar. Whoever has not read this book or listened to this audiobook will enjoy it. I enjoyed it very much."
5,The best variety of bread recipes ever!!!,I found this book in a used bookstore in Madison when I was a college student and baked bread to relieve stress from studying.(Better to punch a bowl of dough than...). Seventeen years later it is still my favorite cookbook and it looks it!! It has an incredible variety of bread recipes and every one is relatively easy to make and tastes great. I have made everything from waffles to Swedish rye to coffeecake to pizza dough. A must-have for those who love to bake bread by hand.
1,disappointed,"I didn't like the book at all. A few pages into chapter one was all I could do.I had to re-read at different times to make sure what I was reading,though the writing style was simple, I found it difficult to followunless I was trying too hard to comprehend the message that I missed it.I don't know. Maybe later....much later, I will try reading it again.Material is vague, and seemed to me at least to be written in riddles.I understand his books are very popular, but I at least could notidentify with this author. He had absolutely nothing to offer menot even spirituality.I think Oprah's show on the same subject was far more beneficial."
2,"The book was great, this movie not so much",Nowhere near as good as the book. Nothing like it. You might like the TV personalities though. Still love Deepak though. Smart man.
5,Spiritual,"Spiritual DVD, an ease to watch and enjoy. Deepak is a great explainer of spiritual awareness. This DVD was well priced and worth the money."
4,worthy teachings,"I have been watching this dvd over and over for days because I want to live it.Deepak is great and I ADORE Olivia Newton John who has a gorgeous,soulful voice and music but in order to really enjoy it I have to mute out most of the other very generic and sometimes irritating people and stories and read the subtitles.This DVD is obviously aimed at Corporate America."
3,Great Story,Great story and character development. Ms Flinn needs better editorial help however. I'm not sure I've ever read a book with so many errors. The Ohio State Buckeye reference in the end was a little sappy - but otherwise it is a class above much of the fiction on the shelf and a refreshing switch from Grisham et.al
3,OHP sheets,The product arrived in perfect shape and was good. I wish there were some tracing papers (butter papers) between the printing sheets because the printing sheets stick to each other sometimes and it is difficult to separate them.
5,Works excellently,"Works great in my HL LJ 2100, I did find that I sometimes have to print two (one reversed) and tape them together to ger REALLY solid coverage but I'm not sure it's necessary and I might have had the printer set on economy... overall it works and I've gotten good use of this transparency paper."
3,"Good, But The Song Tracks Are Different Than Original Manufacturer","This cd is ok. BUT......I heard the track ""Jungle Queen"" on an avante garde jazz radio station late one night and immediatley searched Amazon for the CD. The CD cover lists this disks title as ""Devil's Got Your Tongue,(Jungle Queen is one of tracks) with totally different tract titles than what was actually on the cd I received. (not the fault of the seller at all, by the way). Has anyone out there had the same problem? Or am I in onset Alzheimer's? (lol!) I am still searching for ""Jungle Queen"" the true tracks that originally was on this CD!"
4,One Singular Sensation... suffering from the reviews of snobs,"At one time, A Chorus Line was one of the longest running shows on Broadway, and with good reason... It was (is) an exceptionally good and fresh experience. Unfortunately for the movie, the almost cultish following it created refused to accept the screen adaptation of the same. As the saying goes, people fear change.This hatred/fear can be found in reviews of this Soundtrack as well. Yes, one or two songs have changed from the Broadway Show, some for the Better (Surprise vs. Gimme the Ball) and some not (The Music and The Mirror vs Let Me Dance for You), but the theme, the spirit and the toe tapping spirit of the music is still there and is simply put... fun to listen to."
1,Bleech!,"Hollywood ruined it--the movie and the music. Get the Original Cast Recording instead. Not only is it cheaper, it's much better."
3,Fair,This was not very good at keeping my grandkids interested enough to watch. The 6 year old didnt care for it and the 4 year old only watched about 1/3 of it.
5,Robertson Davies' Alter Ego,"Samuel Marchbanks is a grouchy old newspaperman who struggles with his coal furnace, garden, and neighbours in an attempt to live life as he feels is proper. He is witty, open-minded, well-read, and likes to shock his acquaintances.The Diary is a record of his day-to-day life over a year, with several amusing plot-lines running through it. The Table Talk is just that--a collection of Marchbanks' favourite prandial conversations (or monologues as the case may be). The Miscellanea are letters and various papers, as well as an interview of Marchbanks by Davies.This is an extremely funny collection of fiction. Although knowledge of early twentieth-century Canadian life helps, it's not necessary."
4,Joiner's Review,I really enjoyed the book. Itwas well written and kept my attention and curosity all the way through. I would certainly read more books from this author.
5,Great memories,"Coming from Johannesburg, I was delighted to come across this collection. Fabulous. There are wonderful stories, expertly told and will delight young and old."
4,Must have in Children's story Collection,My daughter is just over 3 yrs. and I wanted some story-telling with an African flavour.I discovered this DVD online and so I purchased it. Both I and my daughter really enjoyed the stories. The story teller was quite animated and interesting to listen to. I like the fact that every story has a moral message and at the end of every story there is a song. I think the songs really help to reinforce the learning and help the children to remember the messages easily.
2,Do Not Buy!!!!!!!!!,"The dvd was professionally done. Unfortunately, I don't think that it depicted the reality of families in Vietnam. The producers portrayed the typical ""city"" family lifestyle as one of luxury. It's difficult to believe that the average ""city"" family in a Third World Country drives a new sedan and and has a housemaid. Oh, I also forgot the grand piano.The filming of the ""country"" family was well done (too well done). The family scenes were idealic and serene. I think that the producers wore their rose-colored glasses when they were filming this. It made life in the country seem like a vacation.I'm not sure what audience this dvd was trying to target but for those who want realism, I would recommend something else."
2,"Decent video, poor disk quality","These Families of the World videos are great, educational tools. However, they use poor materials and are overpriced. For only 2, 30 min. segments, $30 is ridiculous! New, professionally made movies are not that expensive! Taking advantage of educators like this is beyond belief. I own several of these and the material used to make them is very low grade. For this price you would expect better quality DVDs. My copy of Puerto Rico families was only played 2x. When I went to clean the disk it cracked down the middle. I looked at the back and the disk quality is that of a burned disk copy, not the professional grade you expect from a DVD purchase."
5,Families of Vietnam,"Good information on life in rural and urban Vietnam. We enjoyed it, as well as our son."
1,Standard version at ultimate price,"I purchased Years 1 and 2 and enjoyed the extended versions with the deleted material put back in to the movies. Years 3 and 4 are just the standard versions already released but at a much higher price. The deleted portions are added, just like the standard version on a separate disk but not in context, they should have been assembled into the movie.Save your money and get the standard versions as this is just a WB rip off."
1,NOT the ULTIMATE EDITION like the first two...,"The reason I loved the first two ultimate editions was they included the ""Extended Edition"" of the films so that you could watch the movie with all the deleted scenes inserted into the film. I'm glad I didn't impulse buy these (both Year 3 and Year 4) before looking at the back. I can't believe WB thought they could release the first two with extended scenes and then skip out on the 2nd two. I won't be purchasing this to see the documentaries however tempting it might be. What a waste! Don't support WB until they add in the extra scenes."
4,What a mess,"Ok...I saw the movie at the theatres and liked it. It did have problems I admit. But overall I felt like I didnt waste my money.That being said...I screwed up like many other people by going out and grabbing the DVD without realizing I didnt have the two disc edition. So Im out the special features. Im not sure that they would have been worth it but it would have been nice to see them. Anyone who wants this movie, make sure you pay attention and get the edition you want."
1,SCENES ARE MISSING,There are scenes missing from the dvd that were in the movie theater such as Harry falling asleep in divination class with the ladybug and how they explained about Barty Crouch. I hope they come out with a directors cut with the full movie version soon!
4,Good movie,"I think Goblet of Fire is one of the better entries in the Harry Potter movie series. No, there is not an extended version, but it's very well done. Entertaining and worth watching!"
3,It isn't as good as the other movies,"For the first three movies, the kids' cuteness added a lot to the picture. Unfortunately, as they have lost their cuteness, they have not been able to find any greater acting ability than they had when they were pre-teens. The movie focuses far too much on relationships and eschews any continuity and depth that was had in the books.Don't get me wrong, I understand that, as the books get harder, the directors and writers will have to make harder and harder choices about what to exclude and what to keep, but this time the director just chose incorrectly. The movie might appeal to pre-teens because of the heavy focus on relationships between the characters, but the rest of us will just feel excluded."
4,"Good movie, awesome book.","I really enjoyed this movie, but was really hoping for better. This book was the reason I became a fan of Harry Potter. This movie does not do it justice. The beginning is like an Attention Deficit person directing, cut to one scene, build up and then cut to another scene. That being said the actors were excellent. I get a little upset that the 2 disc used to be offered and now the studios are marketing to sell both the single disc and a double disc. The movie is okay but read this book."
4,Another entertaining Harry Potter installment!!,"Another solid effort to bring to life the words of J.K. Rowling. This latest installment is much darker than the others. In this version in particular, there is a very real sense of danger and that Harry could be in trouble. The movie also reflects the growth of the three Potter buddies as they take on more mature life issues (eg. dating) when Hogwarts is infused with students from other schools of magic for the school year. Ralph Feinnes is brilliant as the evil Voltemort and the kids pull off solid performances with more difficult dramatic material and challenges than ever. This is definitely one you will want for the collection."
4,Goblet of Fire in review,"I bought this two-disc DVD after having had the 1 disc DVD since it first came out. I think all Harry Potter fans should have this 2-disc edition as a part of their collection since it has all the deleted scenes and added features that the 1-disc DVD lacks.As for the movie itself, it's a great movie for its special effects and cinematography but if you are expecting it to be like the book, you will be disappointed. All in all, the movie is well worth your money especially if you get this 2-disc edition."
5,Amazing HD DVD movie for everybody.,"The picture quality & audio quality is amazing on this HD DVD release of Harry Potter. I have them all, and I am very happy with them. Much better than the SD DVD version by far.The movie itself is great, just like when I seen it in the Theatres. A must own for anybody."
3,Read the Book First,I read all the books and to really understand the movies you have to read the books they leave to much out. The movie is about 1/4 of the book.
1,One star for manufacturing quality - loved the movie,"I bought this DVD back in 2006, and was about to screen it for the new generation of Potter-philes when I noticed that the entire aluminum layer of Disc 1 (the movie) was coverd by thousands of tiny black dots. On closer inspection, these turned out to be tiny pin-holes in the metal layer, which appears to be melting away. Disc 2 (special features) seemed perfectly fine.The disc still plays well, but I suspect that in the near future the holes will get big enough to defeat the error-correction function of the player. Needless to say, there is no legal way of creating a back-up copy of the disc while it still works - I seem to recall an offer to upgrade old DVDs to Blu-ray for a small fee, but it doesn't seem to be available now."
2,Disappointed,"I thought getting the two disc set would be really great that it would have some great extra stuff... not so much, I could have just bought the regular DVD and been just as happy... was a waste of the extra cash.....oh well, live and learn... the movie is great anyway!"
3,It a hard book to put in to movie...,"I personally think this book was Rowling's best. With that being said it is a VERY hard book to put into movie. There are tones of things going on all the time. I think that they did a good enough job to make it a enjoyable movie but there were some key thinks that they were missing, and some stuff that they spend WAY too long on. For example, The whole Yule Ball thing was WAY too long. It was about 1/4 of the movie. In the book it was 1 chapter. The Whole thrid task sucked, none of monsters Harry in conterted were in the movie."
3,A Disappointment,"I like Rowling's Harry Potter novels very much. She has managed to do something extremely difficult: maintain a high level in a continuing series, with character and plot development that keep interest up and avoid repetition. Unfortunately, that means that by the fourth in the series, the saga has gotten so complex that its installments cannot be made into films of a reasonable length without leaving out enormous chunks of what Rowling has written. The result is a storyline in the film that is impossible to make sense of if you haven't read the novel first and have it firmly in mind. The cast remains at a high level, but things move at such a clip that no one has an opportunity to achieve anything of distinction."
4,"A Pretty Funny Movie (good special effects, too)","This movie has some very funny scenes, especially with all the characters deciding who to ask to the dance. It had some great special effects, especially Voldemort (he looked really gross) and the underwater scene. But two things disappointed me: Fleur and Cho. In the book, Fleur was described as a magical, beautiful person. But in the movie (no offense to the actress, and I'm not saying that I'm extremely pretty either) she was just a plain, simple girl in regular clothes. Cho wasn't mentioned nearly enough, and the movie didn't stress Harry's big crush on her. And the part where he asked her out wasn't as embarrassing for both of them as in the book. All the same, it was a great movie (the best one so far.)"
2,"Get the Two-Disc Special Edition, All this has is the film.","Contrary to what others may tell you, all this copy has is the Film itself, nothing more, nothing less. If you truely want a good copy, get the two-disc special edition. It has far more materieal, including Deleated Scenes! So just spend a few dollars more and get more.Second of all, you don't get a complete experience of watching the film in full screen, the only way to go is Widescreen. If you want full screen then get the VHS."
2,The Bottom Line...,"If you've not read the book, then you will probably enjoy the movie with all the special effects and cute scenes.If you have read the book, like myself, you will be sorely disappointed. I loved the book and felt cheated upon exiting the theater.Let's hope they don't butcher the next book in the name of money."
1,badly damaged casing,"the dvd is ok, but the casing is badly damaged. it's a frustration not able to have a proper casing to keep the dvd"
2,Horrible...,"And I only use that term because I feel that this movie is exactly that. The entire Qudditch World Cup took place in less than 2 minutes when in the book, it lasted chapters!!! In Sorcerer's Stone they spent hours on stupid details the moviegoer didn't need, but nooo. In Goblet, they can't even put in the veelas! (What's up with that? Fleur's 1/2 veela, come ON!) And they totally left out the sphenix in the maze. This movie is NOT that good, so just rent it people, please.Kendall"
1,Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,I too purchased the Target $3.98 copyand found it to be missing so much of the orginal movie that I am returning it. I reviewed the box it came in yet there is no mention of a 'cut' version. Shame on Target for passing this off as the movie without notifying customers of the cut verion.
5,AMAZING,This movie is the best one yet it was some much better than the rest it had more action and more drama. The only part I did'nt like were the parts with Harry and Hermione because they made it look like they liked each other which they don't and now the Harry/Hermione shipper have hope even thought J.K Rowling said herself that Harry and Hermione will never get together.
3,Definitely the worst of the series,"Goblet of Fire is definitely the worst of the Harry Potter movie series, as many viewers have noted. Hopefully this will be the last error of this magnitude in the movie versions of the fantastic books. When young actors are growing up as fast as these are, you really can't afford to make mistakes like this movie. Any later attempt to fill in the missing pieces can only be awkward, at best. One actor said, in one of those pre-release tv info-mercials that there was enough in the book for two movies. I agree, and they should have made two or even three movies to keep the storyline. For those of us who read the books, it is extremely difficult to see how anyone can even attempt to make movies of the following books with all the basic information that is missing from this movie. When I played the unabridged audio books for some friends of mine, they were dumbfounded at all that is missing."
3,What is ultimate?,"I purchased this package in hopes that it would contain deleted scenes (a la LOTR ""extended"" editions). So sad, too bad, it doesn't. So if you already have the movie, this is not worth the money to purchase. If you want to have ""extras"" that are really not that integral, then go for it."
4,Everything changes in this one...,"i recommend that diehard Harry Potter fans buy this film to complete their collection, and this film marks the rough transition of her three main characters (Harry, Ron and Hermione) from childhood into young adulthood, but i feel the plot makes too many twists and turns before the audience understands how these plot threads loosely build into the main story of Voldemort's return to the physical universe and his deeper connection to Harry.Steve Kloves is one of the best screenwriters to this date and he had the difficult job of turning a fun, exciting-but-sprawling story into a cohesive development; 5/5.Emma Watson is an absolute visual treasure, and watching Hermione blossom into a beautiful young woman is breathtaking; 5/5.'...Goblet of Fire' is really the difficult turning point for Harry in the series in so many ways, and Dan Radcliffe convinced me in this movie that he can make me forget about Dan and believe Harry; 5/5my rating: 4/5"
3,Still Disappointing,"While I realize that things have to be left out when making a book of this size into a movie, I think it should be able to be done without making major changes to the storyline. The Lord of the Rings movies are a wonderful example of the right way to take a long, detailed story and turn it into a captivating film that captures the spirit of the book. That is my main complaint about this (and the other 3) Harry Potter movies. The spirit of the book -- the sense of magic and wonder -- is not there.Another small complaint I have is that the movie seems to made for those of us who have read the book. They skim over necessary details that leaves a viewer without background information a little lost. I watched this movie with someone who had not read the book, and he was pretty confused about several things that happened in the movie."
2,Removal of the movie?!,"This was a great movie in the theatre, even though they left out about 30% of the book. My biggest beef with this Widescreen edition is the fact that they took out ANOTHER hour of the movie!! The DVD case states that the movie is 159 minutes. Well the credits end at closer to 99 minutes. The DVD case also states that the special features are not rated or closed captioned. There ARE no special features!!This is a terrible knockoff of the movie. My wife is on her way to take it back to the store so we can try and get the deluxe 2-disk edition in the hopes that they actually had the whole movie. I don't see why you would waste a dual-layer DVD with 99 minutes of content and 0 special features. Sad. Very sad."
3,Wide screen version is very DARK on non-HD TV,"This movie is great, however, the picture is extremely dark on the widescreen version. It might be better viewed on a High-def television. Otherwise, I would choose the version that is formatted for regular tv."
5,Love the movie!!,"The product was in excellent condition and delivered fast. This movie is my favorite of the Harry Potter series. It is so different, in that there are other people featured as well besides Harry & gang. Also do check out the bonus features with deleted scenes. Some scenes in the movie that may seem incomplete finally make sense."
4,Another great HP film,"I hope they never change the main cast, I love watching the them grow through the years. They need to hurry and make the movies faster IMO! I bought this at Amazon.com from an Awesome Deal I found on DailyTool.com."
3,DVD Version Review,"I purchased the special edition DVD hoping a good set of special features. I did not find them. The deleted scenes were deleted for good reason, and some of the cast speeches were mildly interesting. I'm sure if you are a film major these would be interesting, but it was very disappointing to me. On the whole I recommend saving the fiver and get the regular edition."
5,Harry Potter - Goblet DVD - Great Additoin to your movie collection,"The only complaints I have about this DVD was the menu display on my wide screen. The menu buttons on screen were only partially visible. Otherwise, it was a great movie and we are looking forward to the rest of the series."
3,TIme to stick to the books.,"Not much of the real story...very over done. The story (in the books) is about all the great characters and not just a select few. The adult actors in these movies make them worth seeing. We don't watch this one much, if at all. The feel is not right...just don't like it."
3,A Terrible Disappointment,"I am so glad that I read the book before seeing this terrible adaptation. So much of the story was left out that I find it hard to believe that anyone who sees only the movie would know what is going on.First of all, the two house elves Winky and Dobby were left out of the movie altogether, even though they were integral to the storyline. Ludo Bagman was also omitted. The characters of the other TriWizard champions, Fleur and Viktor, were so under developed that you could not particularly care what happened to them during the course of this ill-directed movie. I really miss Chris Columbus. Mike Newell does a terrible job here. He decided it was a good idea to film everything in the dark. Sure, the subject matter WAS dark, but I think movie viewers would like to see what the hell is happening.Thumbs down on this one. I hope Newell will be absent in subsequent Potter films."
4,Goblet of Fire Ultimate Edition Blu Ray,"After purchasing the first 3 movies on DVD, I decided to upgrade to the blu-ray for the last 4 movies. The quality is quite nice, and the extras are consistent with the rest of the ultimate editions with the collectible book, the making of documentary, the extras disc, and the 2 collectible wizards cards. Also, the cover has a lenticular cover, which is cool to look at. It does kind of get caught on the other cases on the shelf. Otherwise, a good purchase, delivered quickly, and what we expected."
3,Worst Harry Potter Movie - But okay compared to most hollywood movies.,"First off, I am not a big Harry Potter fan. Never read the books, but overall enjoyed most of the movies. However the movies seem to getting worse and worse. Making this the worst so far. Worth a rent, but not a buy, unless you need to complete a collection."
3,harry potter and the goblet of fire,"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (Full Screen Edition)I liked the movie as a whole. However I also read the book, so things are left out or changed. i also think some scenes could have been more dramatically written. All in all good filming, acting, but not as good writing."
4,Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire 2-Disc Set,This is an excellent movie and I especially enjoy the bonus disc with the extra features.
4,Great but not,This movie was enormously funny and very suspenseful. Yet the director cut some of the best parts such as the quidditch world cup. I would have rated this 5 stars if not for the cuts.
2,difficult 2 stars,the worst of the serie.I liked the 3 first ones but this one is a waste of time and money.It is totaly boring with lack of génious and inspiration.I will be cautious buying the next one to come..if it comes.
5,The best out of the four.,"Words can not even explain how hot this was. When it came out opening day I went to see this, and like other reviewers Harry potter rocks .UNBELIVEVABLE the action , the tragedy, and the comedy.Voldemort came back worse than he did in the first movie HARRY AND RON argued non stop and Cedric dicgory dies.James and Lydian potter got to speak with harry really touching.The best parts were the 3 tasks ,the dance, and the final confrontation between harry and voldemort or is it."
5,Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,My 15 year old daughter is slightly obsessed with Harry Potter. She's read and re-read the books a number of times. Now she has all the movies too! Great movie!!!!!
3,If I was a carrot I would fly.,This movie wasn't as good as the first three. They left out all of the important parts. Also I don't like the new Dumbledore. He stinks. The old Dumbledore was awesome. Why did he have to die? That is why I like the first and second movie better. Did you know that Mad - Eye Moody got his eye at Radio Shack? Every other thing that he has is from Radio Shack. The movies are getting a lot darker now.
3,John Williams. . .where were you?,"I will say the movie was alright. . . .if you did not read the book; which I did. I was looking forward to the big Quidditch match, but was severely disappointed with the very few minutes they spent on it. The special effects were great and the dialogue was fine. My biggest problem was the music. The new composer was absolutely horrible. The music had no body or personality. It was absolutely boring musically. With John Williams, you go on a journey musically; there are new sounds and instruments. I really missed the women's voices and his ""magic touch"" if you will. I bought the soundtrack to see if I missed anything musically and was severely disappointed. I hope they bring back John Williams. This movie was not the same without him."
2,choppy,"I realize that there is a time limit, but would it have been so very impossible to make a film that actually makes sense? I spent most of the time whispering explanations to those who never read the books (though they had seen all the films at least ten times each).Apart from that the transitions were non-existent, making for a very choppy movie. It seemed that the movie tried to satisfy the fans by adding all the favorite scenes (the ferret!) but they failed. The scenes make little to no sense without the rest of the plot. They also tried to please someone with the hugely overdone dragon scene. It was idiotic. Where was the need for it? Couldn't they have just shortened that scene and a few other similarly overdone scenes, and instead, added a few transitions to make this movie run more smoothly? Would that have been too much work?I just home no.5 will be better."
5,Great Harry Potter movie!,I bought this originally for my wife for Christmas and we have watched it numerous times. I won't spend time talking about the details of the movie or anything like that. But it has some excellent casting and an excellent story.
2,"Good movie, not an extended cut","After the extended cuts presented in volumes 1 and 2 of the ultimate edition releases (which are indeed the only reasons I began collecting the ultimate editions), volumes three to six are incredibly disappointing. If you do not own the films, or do not own them on blu-ray, the ultimate editions may be worth purchasing and for this I am giving it an extra star beyond the first. However, the precedent set in the first 2 releases leaves this one so incredibly disappointing that I feel I was cheated out of my money when I ordered volumes 3-6 to watch before the DH2 premiere."
5,"I admit it, I'm a Harry Potter fanatic","I have to admit it, I adore the Harry Potter series. Everything from the 6 books Rawlings has put out to the 4 movies out so far. Really outstanding series all around. Highly recommend this to adults and kids alike. Truly a masterpiece of fiction all around and the movies are visually stunning."
3,"I liked ""The Prisoner of Azkaban"" better...","After watching this movie in the theatre last year, I was pretty impressed. However, now that I saw it on DVD yesterday, I realized: This movie is not that good. Obviously, there is not enough time to fit all of the book into two hours, but I did feel that other than the Tournament, there was so much missing. All the characters next to Harry were just secondary. Even Ron and Hermione didn't have very significant parts. In a way, I feel that they focused on all the wrong areas. Still, the special effects are nice...As far as the DVD goes: I chose to buy this non-special feautures version, because it is less expensive. I got this DVD at Best Buy and saved a whole $10 by getting this edition.The bonus material is nice, but if you've watched it once, are you reallly going watch it again? Additionally, I have the bonus feautures from the first three movies and they're all pretty similar.In conclusion, this is a nice movie to have in your collection regardless."
3,"Good film, but not the best of the Harry Potter movies.","This was a good film. I liked the acting and the special effects, but I felt something was lacking. There wasn't enough conversations between the characters. Even though it's over two hours, it seemed much shorter. It felt like someone was pushing a fast foreward button too much."
1,Another Industry Rip-Off - No Extended Movie!,I will not be participating in this obvious Rip Off. Blatant and disappointing!WB you can keep 3 and 4! Shame on you!
1,NO Extended Movie - like the first two...,I was soooo disappointed to see that an extended movie version was not included as it was in #1 and #2 HP movie ULTIMATE edition. BUMMER!! I already have a DVD released years ago with the deleted scenes included in this edition. BIG disappointment!!
1,"Bait, switch, and burn","I was very excited when my wife presented me with the ultimate edtion blu-rays for the third and forth harry potter flims, my excitement quicly faded when I came to realize these were nothing like the first two in the ""ultimate"" series. Unlike the first two there is no addtional scenes edited into the films making the rest of the five hours of extras look as sad and tasteless and the flimsy child's deatheater mask that came with another of thier products. What adds insult to injury for me since it was a gift i can't return it for my money or set it on fire to sooth the burn I feel from being bait and switched by this company. So I'm stuck with them but I'll not be giving them anymore of my money any time soon and I will be urging others to the same.If you agree please go the WB's site and give them the review at home, I did, and now to cut and paste to E-bay review. I can't get my money but I can sread the hate around."
5,Harry Potter: 4,This movie series is as great as the book series is and this version DVD version is great!
4,Almost Ultimate,"The edition is Almost ""Ultimate"". Unlike the first 2 movies Ultimate edition, it does not have the extended version. It is a quite disappointing watching it on TV but not available on this Ultimate Box. It seems that even in the Harry Potter Wizards Collection, from year 3 to 7, you don't have the extended version. But all other features are quite amazing."
4,Harry Potter fan,"I love the Harry Potter books. They have adventure, suspense, and all the things that make a good read. I thought the movie was good, too, but I have issues with the exposure on the film. It's really dark and hard to see most of the time. Even if the subject is dark, and this one is, the exposure on the film doesn't need to be dark."
2,DVD of Harry Potter and the Goblet of fire,"I was very disappointed in this movie. This my fav. book of all the Harry Potter books. I think people should read the book before seeing the movie, as it is hard to know what is going on other wise. The movie moves to fast. It is a very long book, so I know they could not get everything in, but they missed alot. I really did not like the person who played Dumbledore. I like him in the first movies, and I know he died but they should have gotten someone like him. Very dark, fast moveing. They make you pay for extra's like games etc. even if you do not want them. Was not happy with this movie."
2,Duped,"I can't believe I was such an idiot! I saw this on sale and snatched it up, only pausing to make sure it was widescreen. Wow. One disc and no special features. What a waste of money! Now I have to go find the two-disc and shell out more cash. Why did they make two versions? They haven't done this in the past with the last three films. I would rather pay a few extra bucks and have two discs. Now I have to buy the whole thing all over again.The rating is for this particular product, not the movie itself."
3,A review of the DVD Release - not the film. Its lacking.,"I've always felt that this space should be used to review the specific product features of the DVD itself, and not the film. Go to the IMDB for treatment of the films content, plot, etc. This is about what Warner Bros did to put the film on the DVD.That said, I'm dissapointed. If you pull out all 4 dvd release and compare them, you see that they are getting cheaper and you get less for the purchase with each one. While films 1 and 2 had cardboard boxes and inserts, movie 3 lost the cardboard box ( a small thing, and some may say an improvement) and now the 4th film lost all inserts as well. (I purchased my copy of the 2 disc kit from Wal-Mart).THe lack of any insert is really sad. A graphical depiction of whats, where on the 2 disc dvd, as was provided with film 3, and many other 'extended, multi-disc' releases, really is essential. It just seems like a profit maximizing effort by WB."
1,Emma WILSON???,It's Emma WATSON! I mean come on! And it's Daniel Radcliffe! Not Daniel Radcliff! How could some one make a mistake like that?!
3,Harry potter and the goblet of fire,This movie was more or less should have been named Selected Scenes From the Goblet of Fire By JK Rowling's. There was not enough important information for someone who had not read the book to have been able to follow the story well. They also left out alot of important plot lines that are crucial to follow story flow into the next part of the story line. It seem to me that the director/producers of the movie decided that this may be the last movie and that it would not gross at the box office so they just hog poged something together to cut corners on the movies budget.
4,Egads...They're Teenagers!!!,"Is it me or is it kind of fascinating watching the characters grow older? (Who knew that Neville Longbottom would be sooo tall?!)Anyhow, the film, I thought overall it was a very good film. Other's have pointed out that it does not follow form to the book, however, as one who has never read one of the books, the film alone is very entertaining. Something had to be left out or this film would have probably passed the four hour mark.As usual, great visual effects. I loved the entry of the two rival schools. Sorry, I now know that they aren't private schools for boys or girls, but it was very entertaining the way it was presented...and isn't that the final point?It was also interesting how the characters have grown up and are recognizing their hormones. OMG I felt really, REALLY, uncomfortable when Harry and Ron were sitting with their ""dates"" at the ball.So would I recommend this film?...sure...I'd even buy it..."
1,Horrible,"This is the worst movie of 2005/6. I cant believe that Daniel radcliffe could even be asked to come back and continue to play his role in the movies. His acting is beyond amateur. He has no facial expressions, and he is just plain boring, his voice and his posture is atrocious. As for emma watson, what is with the constant angriness ? In almost every scene she seems to be shouting, or crying, or being angry. Well she needs to learn that harry potter is not some hollwyood blockbuster drama, but a childrens comedy, and by her acting in the movie, she just clarifies that she doesnt have the skills to do any other movies. Ronald boy is a freak, he is so repetetive in his acting, and he needs a pore cleansing regime."
1,Too much cut out!,"Remember when you went to see this movie in the theater? It was almost three hours long, if my memory serves me. When you buy the DVD you would assume, unless told otherwise, that you are getting AT LEAST as much material as the film version. But not so with this movie! I was very disappointed to find that they had cut material throughout this movie to bring the viewing time under 2 hours. This was painfully obvious to me from the very first scene to the last, and I only saw the movie once in the theater; I can't imagine what a disappointment this is going to be to the REAL fans who may have seen it numerous times. I say save your money until they come out with the FULL movie... which I think they eventually will, after this sham of a version has gotten all the money out of the marketplace that it can. I feel so cheated with this DVD that I am compelled to write my first review, and I hope it helps you avoid wasting your money like I did."
1,"Big fan of the book, but give me a break British Hollywood","Harry Potter is getting too old, and I even think he is gaining weight (right along with the rest of the cast). I am not sure that I can handle 2 hours of the British accent, and the whole thing is totally predictable if you read the book, they hardly make any changes...nice try guys. But a big ZERO for me!One last thought for those considering whether to watch this movie, (and I am not trying to be critical here, just honest...every movie deserves at least three stars because someone worked very hard to get it on the big screen and then on DVD, and besides I don't think we should be judging everyone.) don't you think we have seen enough Harry Potter for awhile? Its getting stupid."
5,Harry and the Goblet of Fire,This was an upgrade to HD DVD. It was what I requested and came in a timely manner.
4,"The Best ""Harry Potter"" Movie Yet (As of 2005)","The first film in the series to receive a PG-13 rating (instead of a PG), ""Goblet of Fire"" is definitely scarier than the first three (which were already scary to some extent), but it is also the best ""Harry Potter"" movie so far. It is very rare for a film franchise to improve with each subsequent installment, but as any fan of the books can tell you, author J.K. Rowling's storytelling abilities are consistently strong, and the characters of both the books and the films are continuing to evolve and deepen, making them easily relatable to readers and audiences. The now-teenaged actors who portray Harry, Ron, and Hermione have also improved in each film, and their performances in the new film are less amateurish than any of their previous ones."
3,"a lot missing, but not bad","now i have not seen the dvd yet, but i saw this film in theatres. now granted the book was a huge 730+ pages i didnt expect to see every detail incorperated intothis film. however i was hoping for more detail to be given on certain things. especially given things to come in later books.now that said if you look at the movie for itself and not as a visual version of the book, you will enjoy it. it does seem to jump around a little but all in all it isnt bad. you dont see much of harry's home life this time around, but if something had to be cut, that was a good starting point. all in all it was a slightly better then average movie. in my opinion P.O.A. was better, but this again is just my opinion."
3,"Amazing book, mediocre movie","There is no comparison to the book. The acting was horrible (kids, Dumbledore) but I assume they were just badly directed - why is Dumbledore raving and out of control? Furthermore, many interesting scenes were cut or shortened - at least give us more world cup quidditch! I love the first 3 movies but this one just didn't measure up. I hope OotP is better."
4,excellent product,This is one of my favorites out of the entire series. This is also a great movie for the entire family.
5,Delighted,Somehow we lost this movie but I am happy that we were able to find another one online. Thank you.
3,Where's the additional scenes??,"After purchasing the ""regular"" single disk version for my nephew, I saw this Deluhxe two disk set and immediately ordered it for myself. I was extremely disappointed to find no addtional scenes! And as noted in a kid's review, some missing scenes as well. Am I missing something or just being dense? I still enjoyed the movie and will keep it, but let's not advertise additional scenes when they are non-existant, shall we?"
5,Fun Movie,"Maybe more for adults than the previous 3 Harry Potter movies, but a good movie none-the-less. We enjoy it."
5,Potter maniac,"As an English person who can relate to the scenes in the films of Harry Potter, the Goblet of Fire stands above the ones gone before. Having read all the books and then been a little sceptical of whether the films would do them justice, all I can say is ""success yet again"". The films is a little sinister in places, which is what it should be and there are hints of the principal characters growing up. In short - a superbly watchable film."
4,A bit more dark,A bit more dark than the first ones with a lot less banter among the actors and actresses. Still following the books fairly well. Special effects well done.
1,Ultimate Edition ?!?!?!?!?,"No extended cut, no 6.1 audio, no point ! Nothing ""Ultimate"" here. Way to drop the ball Warner Bros."
1,Bait and Switch,"Warner Bros. has shown us the dark side of the entertainment business by releasing this ""Ultimate Edition"" without the extended version. It's unfortunate they will still make money on these flawed editions from people who were pleased with the year one and year two sets(as was I), which included both the theatrical and extended films, who will feel compelled to keep this incomplete set (I will be returning mine). I encourage everyone who feels the same to write about it. Whether it's in these reviews, a blog or emails directly to Warner Bros., letting the powers that be know that their customers are dissatisfied is the only way they'll even consider terminating these shady business practices. The following link is to Warner Bros. Studios' online customer service: [...]"
5,Wonderful!!!!,"I love this movie!!! Harry Potter grows up and gets wiser!Although the movie is very short of the book; it still is a great movie and I love what they did with it!The casting folks have hit the mark again with the casting of Katie Leung as Cho. And of course, it wouldn't be a Harry Potter movie without the dramadey known as Hogwarts."
2,? for those who own DVD?,"What is are the differences between the 2-Disc Special Edition & the regular version? What is added on the second disc? (And is this the reason some have complained about a ""cut"" version? Does one have the full version, while the other is edited?)"
4,best movie of 2005,I think it is a really entertaining movie. You probably will like it if you had never scene it. I saw it and I was shocked. I read the book and most of it was cut out.I am a huge fan of Harry Potter.I have all three movies.And I know I am geting the fourth one.But I could not enjoy the movie in the Theator because it was noisey in the theator.Harry Potter 4 has to much acton.I can not wait until the fift Harry Potter comes out.
2,Of course,"Well, we knew he would win. Little suspense, except the film was so dark I found most of it hard to see and I was therefore bored out of my socks. Excellent acting by the cast the CGI may have been great if I could have seen it."
5,EXACTLY LIKE THE BOOK!!!!,This movie is a picture perfect reverence of the book. Everything i pictured from the book came out in the movie. And the charactres in the film match the book's character's personalities. I'd give this movie 10 starts if i could. I sincerely ebcourage people to watch this movie.
3,Not too shabby,well i like all the harry potter books and movies but eh.. this one wasnt what i expected. for one thing they left out1.the quititch(sp?) world cup2.the blasted ended shrews3.winky/dobby4.the book is rather more detailed so i'd rather that u read the book FIRST then buy the moviedont worry the movie wont go anywhere!!
4,Excellent movie!,"Didn't give it 5 stars simply because ""Harry"" is no longer the cute little boy (due to the time between the books being turned into movies) he was in the first one and Ron is getting kind of funny looking.Arminie (sp?) might be a granny before they get the last one done! LOL!A nice family flick all the same."
2,not the best harry potter movie,I thought the the new movie sucked. The acting was good but the movie went to fast for my liking. When I watched it in theaters the movie was just at the begining of the yule ball and I had to go to the bathroom so I go to the bathroom and I come back like three minutes later and the yule ball was over. The movie went to fast for my liking but I'm going to buy it anyways

1,unplayable,small print on back of CD case states that the productis authorised for sale or rent in USA and Canada only. Not surprisingly CD will not play on my UK CD player. why does Amazon despatch an unplayable CD to an address in the UK?
3,"Very dark, but not that way...","I loved this movie; it is my favorite of the four thus far. I feel that it kept its pacing much better than the previous movie, despite the excising of huge sections of the book.However, I write this review to point out that I found the transfer of the movie so dark that it was nearly unwatchable. Everything was so dark that in many shots, people were mere silhouets against the background. I saw this movie in the theater, and remember that the shots weren't like that then. Cranking up the gamma worked, but then the picture was washed out.I'm glad I rented before I bought. I'll wait until another edition comes out (after all 7 movies are out?) before purchasing."
3,Not the greatest Harry Potter movie,"As a fan of the Harry Potter series, I found the movie disappointing. I know that not everything in the book could make it into the movie, but more content then what was used would have made ""Goblet of Fire"" better. They skipped around so much it made it hard to follow the plot line. I would have liked to see the Dursleys and the rest of the Weasley clan in this one. Hagrid and Professor McGonagall seemed to be relegated to the background and the scene of Harry talking to Sirius in the fire was not realistic looking. Not too crazy about Michael Gambon as Dumbledore; the late Richard Harris was much better in the role.The movie didn't do the book justice. I can only hope ""Order of the Phoenix"" is better. Don't waste your money on ""Goblet"" and put it towards the last book in the series when it's published."
2,Bad Movie,"This was the worst Harry Potter movie out of the five. It was also my second favorite Potter book (the seventh was the best) and that made the movie more disappointing. They left out so many good parts from the book, and the parts they left in where messed with. I would not buy this if I where you, if you want to buy a Potter movie, buy the third, that was the best one!"
4,Great rainy day fun,"I still like the third movie best, but this was at least better than the first two."
5,Harry Potter Goblet of Fire,As always I have found the Harry Potter Potter Series great. This latest was no disappointment. I think its originator Ms J. K. Rowling has done an excellent job with her books and now to see the video is fantastic.
4,Another good movie,"I hate to be repetative, but I must for my review of these movies. It is hard to take all the rich details of a thick book and squeeze it into two hours and expect it to make sense to anyone who not a fan of the books. This is just the highlights of a great series brought to film for those who want to see what, up till now, their imagination had to make up."
5,excellant extra features,"The DVD was very good with lots of extra special features that added to the story line. Lots of newer interviews. The section on the composers of the various movies was good. Sine Goblet is my favorite of the series, it was a worthwhile investment."
2,Italian language available ?,Someone could tell about italian language on ultimate edition ?Thanks for helpHarry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Ultimate Edition) [Blu-ray]
1,Not paying for something of lesser quality...,"I was prepared to purchase this (as well as year 3) but once I read that neither set includes extended versions of the films, I decided to save my money. There are plenty of other things more deserving of my hard earned money. If the ""powers that be"" want my money, they should re-release this with an extended cut of the film just like they did with years 1 & 2."
1,Disappointment - NO EXTENDED versions,Like theHarry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (Ultimate Edition) [Blu-ray] andHarry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (Ultimate Edition) [Blu-ray] Ultimate set I expected these to be extended as well.But there are not extended at all... same as previous Blu-ray releases.Too bad :(
2,lacking,"No extended cuts that are aired regularly on TV and no lossless audio. The extras make it a tempting buy, but WB skimped on the crucial aspects of the ""ultimate"" editions this time"
3,Somewhat disappointed,"While all of the additional material included in 3 & 4 is very cool, I was expecting the extended versions of the movies to also be included as they were for 1 & 2. This is disappointing, especially since that was one of the reasons I really waited to buy the Ultimate Editions."
2,worst of the potter films,"This was a bad movie all around. Dumbledore played as aggressive & angry toward Harry is so far from the books. Harry's developing rapport with sirius was virtually eliminated. Not doing the scene at the dursley's was a huge mistake...one of the best scenes in the book.In short, no plot, poor character development, only the last 20 minutes of the film was any good...the graveyard scene was decent.The action is not enough to make up for the lack of depth and continuity. OTP is a much better film by far.Interestingly, Chris Columbus said he would have made GOF into two movies. He may have been on to something."
4,Great Adaptation of book...,"It's Harry's 4th year at Hogwarts. After attending the World Quiddich Cup where the Deatheaters came out to wreak havoc, Harry worries about his dreams of Voldemort. But, Harry expects that at Hogwarts this year things will be quiet. However, someone has entered him into the Tri-Wizard Tournament and he has to compete even though he is underage. The tournament is dangerous and in the past contestants have died. This year is a test of friendship, loyalty, and honor.To fit the time frame many of the subplots and build up to some of the major themes were left out. You can enjoy the movie and have a great time viewing it, I know I did. But read the book, it will just add to the experience."
4,Release date,"Those who have said HP4 will be coming out in March or April and the Warner Bros has it for pre-order. Are you ABSOLUTELY positive? I've been on Warner Bros official site and it says that the DVD does not yet have a release date. Looking back on all of the other films, they were released 6 months after the film was released in theaters, which pushes the release date out until May. I really hope I'm wrong on this and you people are right. I'm looking forward to getting my hands on the DVD!"
1,What a dirty trick,"Ran into Bestbuy today grabbed the first DVD of Potter I saw. Got home, it was one disc no special features. Why not just make one edition like with all the other Potter movies? What a dirty rotten trick pulled by Warner Brothers. (...)"
2,BIG Disappointment,"I was expecting the extended editions just like the first 2 movies. Now I am sorry I bought 3 and 4, they are the same as the movies I already own."
1,Another crappy rush job!,This whole film is just too rushed and it left out too much story from the wonderful book and it keeps the continuity errors from the third film. It and the third film only deserve one star for some good acting. My suggestion is that you stick with the book series and the first two films.
4,Sin escenas adicionales,"Al igual que en las ultimate edition de HP 1 y 2, esperaba encontrar escenas extendidas en HP 3 y 4 ultimate edition...Fue una decepción darme cuenta que no venían escenas adicionales."
2,Not very different from upscaled DVD,Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire [Blu-ray]It is hard to believe that this was not just an upscaled version of the standard DVD which I have also have. There does not seem to be any extra detail.
1,Betrayed,If you are a fan of the book do not watch this movie. They have turned what may be the best book of the series into an amusement park ride - all flash and no substance. As the books evolve J K Rowling has targeted an older and more mature audience. This movie targets the mindless.
3,Meh. It's ok.,"Great special effects in the dragon fight, lake, and maze. The movie's shot really darkly, and the differences between Harry and everyone else seem just a little contrived and over the top.On balance, it's just about an ""OK"" movie. The special effects were very well done."
2,Sub Par for a long term Potter fan,"I, Sir Charles Butterweight, am dismayed and perplexed before this latest installment in the once delectable Harry Potter series. I shall accord the directors a chance to redeem themselves in the next opus, although I feel compelled to state now that if it is anywhere near as bad as this one, it will definetly count the last for old Charlie boy."
2,"WAIT TO RELEASE ON ""BLU-RAY"" DVD"" BY SUMMER!!","All new and old titles going to comes out in ""BLU-RAY"" this summer! If u DVD collector like I am Then stop buying any DVDs, Just rent instead for now!!. I Owen over thousand DVDs in pass 10 years and STOP buying DVDS since DEC/05 ...Because all old and new titles going release on ""BLU-RAY"" & hit store this summer! Then start buying DVDS again like I will do. Included this movie ...U get crystal clear picture and sound. I stopped buying any DVDS for while now!! I guess better wait then be sorry!!!"
1,one star is WAY too good. -10 is more like it.,"Harry Potter is entirly overrated. The movies are horrible, and the books are really quite shallow and uninteresting. What concerns me is the amount of evil things, gore, and even bad examples being set by the characters. (I'm Harry, and I'm going to pout over little things and blow up in incredibly immature tantrums.)Harry Potter is just horrible. Don't buy it. Don't even think about it."
1,were we all watching the same movie?,"I thought this was a lame excuse for a HP movie! I realize the book was quite long, and this could have made for a long, long movie, but there was so much left out that several times I felt that I had come in in the middle of something. Had I not read the book I wouldn't have really understood many things that were going on, and then there are the plot lines that weren't followed UP! I am afraid, in this case, ""Potter Stinks"" is the correct slogan. Aside from the usual excellent performances by all the cast, it was a couple of hours wasted. Back to the wonderful book!!!!"
4,Great Continuation!,"I'll start by saying that I loved this movie. So, why four stars?There was quite a bit left out that was in the book. While I understand that material had to be left out due to the length, it was a shame to have cut out S.P.E.W.!Also, while the actor who played Voldemort is very good and fit the role, I would have prefered to see Rowan Atkinson as Voldemort. (There was a rumor going around that he had been cast in the role, and I think he would have brought so much more to it.)Other than those small issues though, they did a wonderful job with the fourth Harry Potter installment. I can hardly wait for ""Order of the Phoenix!"""
2,"picture/manufacturing quality is lacking, pixelation problems abound","While everyone else is talking about the direction and editing of this movie, has anyone noticed that the picture quality on DVD is much worse than you would expect from a blockbuster. I expect that they cut costs in manufacturing. I remember when everyone was saying the DVD/CD was the greatest next thing because it would not break and could store vast amounts of information. There was poor picture quality and pixelation the first time through on this Harry Potter 4 DVD. Its like guns, guns don't kill people, people kill people. In this case, poor DVDs don't make pixelation; manufacturers who won't make quality DVDS make pixelation problems. Shame on them!"
3,Underwhelmed,"I left the theatre feeling like the goblet was half full. Passable but not memorable. I hope the movies aren't losing it, while the books are putting it all together. Make 5 & 6 fast."
2,TOTAL CRAP-WORST OF THEM ALL,"THE PACING OF THIS FILM IS JUST AWFUL, THE CHANGE OF DIRECTORFOR THIS ONE, IN MY OPINION WAS A BAD MOVE. IF YOU ARE A POTTER FAN YOU WILL PROBABLY LOVE IT."
1,Enough Chumps Will Buy It Anyway,"Goblet of Fire, the movie, is an unacceptable hash. Sure, the original is a long book. Did the mercenaries running this franchise think perhaps to make it into two movies and sell them both? I understand that a film adaptation of a novel is an adaptation, not a copy in another medium, but it must still be a finished work in its own right. GOFtm is so disjoint and illogical and the progress through it so unmotivated that a fair amount of what happens in it makes no sense. It would be a complete waste of money even if the book did not exist. This is not a film but an insult. Slapdash, haphazard, chopped up exploitation. The cinematic equivalent of a Barbie doll."
3,"Boring, but must-have for HP fans","This wasn't a bad film. It wasn't a good film, either. I knew they'd have to leave out most of the book, so that's not what disappointed me. The tournament was boring! They spent so much time on Harry getting chased by a dragon outside of the tournament area (unseen by the crowds, and not part of the book), that they had to short-change the rest of the tourney. Not worth watching a second time, but if you're collecting the films and the books, you need this. I also bought the first DVD I saw, and it had NO extras. Not a conversation, not a deleted scene, nothing.I wish they had done two films, and had Harry's family and the Quidditch game on a separate disk just for fun.Like I said, not the worst film in the world, but not a good film either. And is Daniel Radcliffe short? It looked like he was lots shorter than anyone else in the film."
4,Not bad...Not bad at all.,"AJB...I don't where you got your DVD that is under 2 hours, but mine is 157 minutes (2 hours 37 minutes)...exactly like it was it the cinema, that aside, good movie. On par with the rest of the films."
5,Great movie even after reading the book,"These movies only get better, as do the books. The only reason to be disappointed is if you read the book first and actually expected them to put all that detail in the movie. That would make it a what? 8-10 hour movie? No thanks. My daughter and I both read the book before hand and thought the movie was awesome. If your the type that becomes disappointed in movies after reading the book, then wait until the movie comes out and watch it first. The books can only get better."
5,Worth the money,Even those who are not die-hard Harry Potter fans will like the Goblet of Fire. I wasn't a DHHPF and I thought the movie was great. Now I'm hooked.
4,It's great!!!,This movie was great and I like it. This movie scene was excellent. This movie was another big hit for Harry Potter series. I enjoyed the movie.
5,Enjoy the entire film series!!,"I have some of the films on HD-DVD as well, but there is no differnece in quality between the two. Great film!!"
2,Read the book skip the movie.,I would have liked this movie if I hadn't read the book first. The first 3 movies did some justice to the books. This one followed none of the fun story lines and couldn't because of time contraints. The story wasn't 100% all about the contest and the ball. They show a hint of the reporter and her lies but what Hermoine does to her in the end and how she got her scoops that is the real fun part. This movie was all about eye candy graphics and time contraints. I suggest you watch the movie before you read the book (if your interested in the potter movie series) But my ultimate suggestion is Read the book skip the movie.
3,It was okay...,"This movie has great effects and it is chop full of action, but honestly as the movies progress the acting gets worse, a couple examples: Emma Watson as Hermione yelling at Harry ""I'm not an owl!"" please.. and Daniel Radcliffe's really bad crying job when he comes back from the graveyard with Cederic's body.. don't get my wrong i am a huge harry potter fan but this movie and the acting just didn't cut it for me."
3,Flawed but entertaining,"This movie was the most empty of all four films so far. I did not like Newell's direction at all. I'm not sure he ""gets"" the Harry Potter universe. The fourth book has so much depth to offer a story line, yet Newell missed it completely. The movie is nothing but special effects and people moving from point a to point b.I understand the book was very long, but this film lacked serious relationship and interaction between the characters.Its a shame that these films cannot be produced fast enough to keep up with the maturing cast. The actors are already too old for the roles.Very disappointed in this film and the direction.Having said that, it should be enjoyable for fans of the series, and there's enough in here to keep attention - simply because the film moves at such pace.If you'll like Harry Potter you'll like this one, but if not then it won't help convert you."
3,The low price 1 disk only has the movie. No features. Doh!,I got the regular widescreen by mistake. I really wanted the special features and there are NONE on the one disk set!!! Doh!
2,"Should have been exciting, ended up boring",I found the book to be incredibly exciting and I assumed that all that entertainment would translate easily to film. I guess not!It wasn't until I tried to watch the movie on DVD after seeing it the theaters opening night that I realized how very boring the movie is. I have been unable to watch it all the way through a 2nd time.
2,not nearly as good as 3,"Come on! The character development was terrible, and the cast poorly directed. All one has to do is compare this film to the previous one to know that is far under par"
3,Disappointed in DVD,"I bought this DVD, not realizing that there was also a deluxe two disk set (we've never had these options in the past). I and my children were very disappointed to find that this DVD is just the movie (which we had seen at the theater). We had been looking forward to the deleted scenes, interviews, and interactive features. Obviously, we loved the movie itself, or would not have bought this one. Just beware that this is movie only with NO EXTRAS."
2,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed that when ordering, nothing was said about there being another version, the 2 disk version, with all the extras. That's what I usually get the Harry Potter DVD's for. Especially the deleted scenes. Being incapacitated by surgery at the moment, I can't begin to tell you how let down I was when I got this DVD, only to find out that I spent my money on something I didn't really want. The movie, itself, is great, but I've seen it in the theatre already. Amazon needs to be more specific with their pre order information."
2,MAD MAD MAD,Has anyone else noticed that there have been scenes left out of the DVD that were shown in the theater??? Like when Harry was falling asleep in divination and he saw the ladybug? Or the scene after he finds Barty Crouch passed out? There is a lot missing in this movie and my friend just got the 2 disc version and they aren't in her movie either. Maybe they are in her deleted scenes but THEY WEREN'T DELETED!!! What happened to 15 minutes of my movie. RUNNING TIME IN THEATER: about 170 minutes; RUNNING TIME ON DVD: 157 minutes..... you do the math!
5,Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,Wonderful addition to the Harry Potter series... I cant wait until the next one comes out... I will be one of those people waiting in line when the last book is released....
3,This one let us down a little,"OK, you can't compress War and Peace into a 2-hour film. But a little of the World Cup could have been pressed in, surely no one would have complained. And there's no excuse for turning Harry's beautiful finessing, all in front of a rapt & gasping crowd, of the broody Horntail into just another wreckage-strewn chase scene - certainly it saved no time.Moody: Gleeson doesn't quite fill Mad-Eye's boots, seems tempted to ham it up a little. For me, Moody's less flamboyant, more hard-bitten, harsher featured.Voldemort: Ralph Fiennes, a fine actor, is sort of wasted in such a one-dimensional role. Not his fault, but whence all the accolades?Still, a good film in other respects, very watchable; just, given the material, not as good as it should have been and in that regard (for me), the least of the four."
5,very good,"he loved it, its played perfect, what else is there to say. he has probably played it 50 times and it still plays perfect"
2,Poor streaming video quality,"This was my first amazon instant video purchase and if this is the level of quality I can expect then I'll stick with Netflix. The video was supposed to be HD and the on-screen menu indicated I had the bandwidth for a ""high quality"" stream but any dark scenes (which there's a lot of in Harry Potter movies) were splotchy with muddled colors. I use Netflix on the same PS3/internet connection and never have issues like this.The movie itself is good but the poor streaming video quality made it almost unwatchable."
4,Must read in every young person life as a prelude to Lord of the Ring Trilogy..,Reading it at 35 years later and after the LOT movies is just not as intense. Don't think Hobbit should be made into 3 movies. LOT trilogy is my favorite of all time. HOBBIT is more mundane.
3,The Hobbit in Review,"The Hobbit is a book about and hobbit named Bilbo and 13 dwarves. The dwarves take Bilbo on an adventure to regain their treasure that was stolen by a talking dragon. On the way Bilbo and the dwarves run into goblins, trolls and elves. All three of these creatures capture them but they end up escaping. They meet a man who can change into a bear and the Lord of the Eagles. They finally make it to the mountain where the dragon lives. The dragon is killed by a guy from lake town and the dwarves with Bilbo reclaim the treasure. A couple of days later every person who knew about the treasure was there to take the treasure. They a have the Battle of Five Armies and the dwarves keep their gold. Bilbo goes home and lives the rest of his days in his hole."
2,Gaak!,"Friends kept badgering me to read this book and I finally gave in. It was so-so for the first fifty pages, but after that point I felt as if I was slogging through mud. Get to the friggin' mountain already, Bilbo! The Hobbit is little more than a high-falutin' fairy tale with a cheap ending. I feel sorry for anyone who believes it to be ""the greatest book ever written"" (see other reviews). Truly, you need to widen your reading experience."
2,Unsatisfying!,"This book is a shame because J.R.R. Tolkien writes very well; but the topic is not interesting at all. How can you expect one to read about dwarves fighting a dragon, dwarves going to war with elves, 'Wood-elves' imprisoning dwarves?, or the evil, horrible 'Wargs'!? You can either like or dislike a book like this."
1,Waste of time and money,"Horrible audio, terrible voices, vast majority of the book was left completely out of the production. Please fine a better one"
3,"Interesting little tale, but definitely more for children","Although an oft amusing little tale (I especially liked the Gollum) and although I come to this book late, I have to say that I felt I was reading an Enid Blyton book most of the time, which is by no means a critism because she, above any other author fired my imagination as a child (which begs the question, why is this considered 'classic literature' and not 'The Enchanted Wood' or 'The Magic Far Away Tree')?I'm glad I've read it as it's much talked about, but it certainly wouldn't make me want to go on to read LOTR's.To be fair though I have to say I'm not usually attracted to the fantasy genre and read this because I felt I ought to. That said I thoroughly enjoyed all the Harry Potter books and Philip Pullmans 'Dark Materials' trilogy. I think maybe I just prefer a little human intervention to make things realistic now I'm an adult and parallel worlds are more interesting than gnomes, goblins and elves."
4,Timeless story full of fantasy and adventure,"The story has many hooks an character's that are timeless. Amazing the creativity and vision Tolkien had. Kid to Grandparent and all in between, read and enjoy."
5,Hobbit,"Still holds up after all these years,a true classic of fantasy,and a pleasure to rediscover the world of BIlbo Baggins."
2,Poor Quality,"There are many options for purchasing The Hobbit, and this edition is one to avoid. Cheap paper and binding. This was purchased as a gift - and I was sorry."
2,Tolkien,"I am not a Tolkien fan, I've realized. I could drum up no interest whatever in his stories OR his characters."
3,Wonderful adventure,"Wonderful adventure, just wish there was more depth given to the characters like in Lord of the rings...good light read"
3,"For the Classic it is suppossed to be, I found it disappointing.","A lot of narrative of fighting and capture, thin characterizations, thin backgrounding, focus undirected, it is okay, but I was underwhelmed."
4,The Hobbite,I thought that this book was a very interesting tale about a hobbite who went on an interesting journey to fight a dragon . I thought Tolkien made the charectors come to life in your head. e made theem sem like they pop off the page. When i was reading the page i could image the scenes in my head. Over all it was and exciting book. I liked it alot.
5,Best book ever!!!!!!,This book was full of adventure and awesomeness. I definitely recommend it to you. The battle of five armies was the best part.
5,Perfection in its purest form.,"If you are between the ages of 12 and 3000 and you have not read this book you must do so now! This is for a variety of reasons. Even if you have no plans on reading the Lord of the Rings series (shame on you!) you should read this book. It is not long at all, roughly 300 pages, and every single one of those pages should be cherished for the rest of your life. All the characters will be loved all the way until the unexpected conclusion. The description is excellent. It doesn't spend 30 pages describing the way a rock has shine in the sun, (such as the owrks of T. Goodkind) but instead takes a surrounding as a whole and polishes it to shine like that rock.The bottom line: Read this now! If you plan on reading Lord of the Rings, you will need to or you won't understand much at all. Also, it is a great book on its own too."
5,A book that explores your imagination,"When I first read The Hobbit I was 13 and although I did not fully understand everything and the language was not easy I loved it and finished it in a day. I could not put it down. Now I am older and I see and read books deferently. I judge them and try to be more critical about them, but THE HOBBIT is still one of my favourite books. I admire the author because of his imagination that has no limits. The language is rich and colourfull and the characters very interesting. It is something everybody who want to escape the everyday life and spend at least a couple of hours in a magical world, should read."
5,My second time,Only a few times in our life are we able to read a story like this. I will probably read the trilogy again.
2,cheesy/boring,sometimes when i was reading this i just feel like why am i reding this?? people told me that its a goodbut technically it makes no sense at all. its not tht great honestly.
4,VERY GOOD,Great book the story is told with amazing detail and clarity. Not a single thing I would change except some pictures are sideways.
4,The Hobbit,"The Hobbit was about a little hobbit named Bilbo Baggins. Bilbo and his friends,the Dwarves make many dangerous encounters on a journey to retreive the tresures of the Dwarves ansectors. I enjoyed this book very much. It kind of dragged towards the closure of the book. The creativity the author shows is astounding.I really enjoyed the scene where Bilbo and Gollum have a riddle contest."
4,"Great book, I didn't find it as much of a child's book as reviewed","I never read The Hobbit when growing up and knowing that the movies were going to be released I decided to read the book. I agree that the Dwarves part in the first chapter was a little bit overdone but once you got through this initial part of the book I thoroughly enjoyed the story. I would not discourage anyone from reading the book simply because of the first chapter, after the initial chapter the book goes rather fast."
3,Tim,Didn't include the whole book. Read it before and last several chapters were missing in kindle version. Disappointing to say the least.
5,A lighthearted story preceding an epic adventure!,"This book was great! It was able to capture the imaginations of both adults and children with elements of fantasy and have a both complex and easy to understand plot. It is hard to believe how Tolkein managed to create this entire world. Read the Lord of the Rings, too! It's like a Bible! I LOVE IT!!!!!!!"
3,A pretty-good fantasy,"This was a good book compared to some of those that I have read for school. There were some dull moments, but the exciting ones overcame the others. The characters turned out to be courageous (to my surprise). This was a good example of fantasy, and a good choice for Elementary through High School."
4,He puts David the Gnome to Shame,"This is the first fantasy book that I ever read. Some will call The Hobbit a children's book, and I suppose that it could be. But, at age 23, I really enjoyed it. Each chapter has it's own plot, complete with problem and resolution, and a hook at the end to keep you turning the pages. Although Tolkien has his long-winded moments in this book, as LOR readers should be familiar with, the plot is great. I have read The Fellowship of the Ring, and I (GASP!) think that this book is better, from the standpoint of not being bored with any of it. Of course, once you read it, you'll want to find out what happens next, and the LOR series will soon follow.I highly recommend this book. It's entertaining from start to finish, and it's a great book for people young and old."
5,Wonderful Book,"This book, The Hobbit was very much enjoyed by me and my companions on our journey across the mountains. Every night we would bond together when reading this amazing book. Thank you lord for having it written."
5,Here and back again?SENSATIONAL!!!,"I loved The Hobbit with all of Bilbos adventures!!!! I just couldn't put the book down, litrally I was up all night reading Bilbos adventures!!!LOVED IT!!!I just kept turing the page and found that the book got better and better....and you wouldn't think it but even better!!!JUST LOVED IT!!!!!I just can't beleive someone could right this well!!!THANKS TOLKEIN!!!!LOVE THE HOBBIT!!!!!"
5,Open up your minds,"I have just read the reviews of this book, and I want to say to everyone, past and future, to practice what Samuel Taylor Coleridge called ""a willing suspension of disbelief."" Forget about stylistic problems and tongue-twisting placenames, this is a story meant to be enjoyed at face value. Sheer delight!"
5,Wonderful Edition of a Wonderful Book,"I bought this edition about 7 years ago. It's a beautiful encased leather-bound book that will last a lifetime. Easily the best way to own this classic. If only it were still available from the publisher. Oh well, I'm not giving mine up! :)"
4,Surprisingly Complete,"The most impressive thing about this graphic novel version of The Hobbit is how true to the original source material it is. A person finishing this book will have a very strong understanding of exactly what happened in the novel. I agree with other people that this would be a great way for a 7 year old to be introduced to the story.The only thing I would want to change about it is its size. It feels just a tad too small to comfortably fit all the text and panels that it crams into each of its pages. I also feel like the color palette is a bit too bright and cheery throughout. I think the whole thing would have felt more true to the spirit of the book if the saturation levels were pulled back a bit. It might even benefit from being printed on matte paper stock. As it is, the glossy paper and bright colors just don't feel quite right."
4,Classic,This graphic novel sets the bar for fantasy literature writers and readers as well. It is a satisfying retelling that weaves a story for the reader to discover and leaves one wanting more without gaping holes in the mythos.Perfect as an introduction for younger readers.
4,enjoyable,I enjoyed this 'story in itself' - although I felt it was aimed at a different age bracket than the Silmarillion.An epic tale of Bilbo Baggin and friends in the precursur to The Lord of the Rings.The Ring of Power comes into the most innocent of hands - and the strings of destiny are pulled together.Enjoyable.
5,Really brings the book to life,"I expected this to be a typical audio book with one person reading, and was surprised to find a cast of characters, music, & sound effects!! This is really well done, and I highly recommend it."
5,Loved it,Very good book! I am a huge fan of J.R.R. Tolkien & his writing style. The books are just as good as the movies!
5,Awesome,Hendricks helps Seth if the he believes in Beijing terrors. Haha not really. In jk lol I need 4 more words yay done
4,I liked this edition,"It is The Hobbit so no wonder I liked it. The Kindle version was formatted great. I had a free copy from Google Play store and it was not formatted correctly for Google Books on iPad. Nor would the audio files play. With Kindle for iPad, I had none of these problems. My main plus for this edition was the inclusion of the audio files of Tolkien reading parts of the book. My only complaint is that there was not enough of that. Overall, happy I went ahead and repurchased on Kindle."
4,As described,bought for my son who needed this book for english. Item as described. and served its purpose. I haven't typed enough.
4,Wonderful read,The story is easy to read with less cynicism of later Tolkien works. I would recommend it to anyone starting to read this genre.
4,The Hobbit,"The Hobbit is a very good book. Tolkien takes ideas of great creatures including dwarves, hobbits, and other living things to create a great plot. The book, although fiction, can really make you seem like it is real. You just forget what is going on around you and you think that you are in the story. The Hobbit is a wonderful book and is one of the best fiction books that i have ever read, besides The Lord of the Rings trilogy..."
4,The Hobbit Review,"I think that this book like many books starts off slow. But once you get into the excitement and adventures in Mirkwood forest the book becomes interesting.It is fun to see how all the characters in the Lord of The Rings Movies, come about. Most of all you get to see how ""the ring"" comes into the hands of Bilbo.The book has some good conflicts that the characters get into to, but of course they always get out them with the help of some Gandalf or some of his enchanted friends.If you like the ""Lord of the Rings"" movies then your sure to like the prelude to all the exitment."
1,What a HORRIBLE book.,"I just don't see how everyone loves this book. It is a *never ending* tale of Bilbo Baggins and his 'journey' with the wizard and dwarves. J.R.R. Tolkien is a quite horrible writer...the story goes on and on and on, continuing with them hiding in a cave, fighting a dragon, or another thing of that sort. I am a pre-teenager and I still cannot focus on it because of its pure stupidity."
1,What a fantasy,"I could never seem to get into this book; why? It is a tale of 'Bilbo Baggins' and his journey with Gandalf and the dwarves to find treasure, and defeat the 'evil dragon', Smaug. It seems pointless; adventure after adventure, many characters, and no main theme. It was a childish and boring book (as well a series)."
5,classic,It's just a classic adventure. Thought id re-read it before the movie comes out. I forgot how much I love this story and these magical characters.
5,beautiful edition,"The Hobbit was the first real novel I read. I was fortunate enough to be given the golden 50th anniversary edition when I was a child. I love this book. With the upcoming movie release, I thought I'd read it again, but found my gold version's pages falling out and didn't want to damage it further.When I saw this little leatherette-bound edition, I was in love. It's so easy to hold and read. The cover feels nice and soft in your hands. And, honestly, it's just a beautiful little book.If I could improve it at all, I'd add a bookmark, but that's such a little thing to worry about."
4,The Hobbit,"I have read The Hobbit, and I think that it was an exellent book. Reading the Hobbit was like going on an adventure with Bilbo Baggins and the rest off the characters and creatures in the book. The Hobbit is very intertaning it takes you on an dangerous adventure throw a make belive world there are many things that Bilbo faces some are good and some are evil. The Hobbit is about an adventure that Bilbo and the elves take looking for a treasure that is gaurded by a dragon. I think that everyone should read the Hobbit young or old, you'll love it."
4,Grandson loves this book,"I purchased this book for my 11 year old grandson. He loves it! Has shown it to his 13 year old neighbor/best friend, and he thinks it is a good version of this book. His friend has also begun to read The Hobbit; they are critiquing it together. Thanks."
5,Literary pleasure at its best,"I'm not going to try to pretend that I can write something very original on this literary gem. The only way to describe the joy it gives is to give a nice copy to the other party and let her read the book, or rather let her enter the wonderful world created by Tolkien. I'm impatiently waiting for my son to grow up, so that I can read this to him. I don't know who'll enjoy Tolkien's world more, he or I, but I'm sure we'll come across this masterpiece more than once. And who is to complain, anyway?"
5,halfling,/most excellent adventure tale. Created a love of the entire genre of science fiction fantasy. Read and reread for years to come
4,Classic read.,Classic read that brought back many pleasant memories from my childhood when I first read it. Love the e-book/kindle format!
5,Great!,I chose this rating because I never wanted to out the book down. I was surprised by the ending and can't wait to see what they do with the movies.
5,Classic since I was young,Have always enjoyed this book and read it the first time 20 years ago and had to read it again with the new movie just out.
5,One of the best stories,"I bought the hobbit so I can read it again (for the third or forth time) and so I could read it to my 11 year old daughter.It is a great adventure story about a little guy who has adventures and find strength he didn't know he had.If you haven't read this book, you should."
5,This book was Awesome,The Hobbit is a wonderful book. After reading this book I fell back into reading all books. This book sends off a message of adventure. I encourage everyone o read this book!!!!!
5,Love it!,Was a very exciting adventures book about a simple little hobbyist who goes on an adventure with a wizard and 13 dwarves
5,Bilbo's Best Adventure,"I must admit this is not my first reading of this book, actually it is my third. I first had occassion to read this when my sons were in Jr. High School where as part of its curriculum this was compulsory reading. So, as a result we read it together. I find it a highly entertaining adult fantasy and those who have little or no imagination are missing out on a most delightful escape from the daily hum-drum of life. So read if you dare!Now back to my new Kindle e-reader - I just love it and also not having to go to the library when I want a book. I just go into the Good Reads application on the computer, decide what I want to read, then simply key it into my Kindle and its there that fast. No more waiting for borrowed books to be returned. Wonderful!"
5,Amazing!,"This book is fantastic! I haven't had the chance to read it in the past and since the movie is coming out, why not read the book to go with the movie? So far, it exceeds my expectations and I love it."
4,The Hobbit is a good read,"I bought this for my kids to be introduced to Tolkien. This is a good introduction to the world of MiddleEarth, Hobbits, wizards and dragons. And Gollum."
4,I think this book is superb and thrilling.,The Hobbit is a great book to read on your free time. When you start reading you can't stop. The charecters are really realistic. It really seems like there are some little people called Hobbit's live in little dens. It is very adventoruous and action packed. I could read that book again and again. This book has so many details it will blow your mind away. J.R.R Tolkein is a great aouthor and I would like to read more of his books! I just like to say thank-you to J.R.R Tolkein for writing this wonderful book the Hobbit. You shoould read it for yourself and find out the majic in the book.
5,The Hobbit,"By: Aspen IshiiThe Hobbitby J.R.R TolkienThe Hobbit is an absolute classic. This book is about a hobbit named Bilbo Baggins who joins a party of dwarves in their quest for treasure. He finds himself in many sticky situation. As he and the dwarves embark on this dangerous journey, they will encounter much hardship and creatures such as goblins, dragons and orks. This book has many riddles, twists and turns that will keep you interested and will make you want to keep reading. J.R.R Tolkien has created a whole new world of fantasy and adventure; that's the reason way I liked The Hobbit. I would also recommend reading The Lord of the Rings also by J.R.R Tolkien. You'll recognize some old characters and meet new ones on the way. I would recommend these books for 5th graders and up."
5,Great book a little intence for younger children,I bought this book for my son who is 9. He enjoyed the book but did feel it was kind of intense. The fight scenes are very well written and subsequently scary. All in all he did enjoy this book and it is a great alternative to harry potter ect.
4,how can you go wrong,the hobbit is such a nice little story. About the adventures of bilbo the hobbit. His travels with the trolls and out smarting the cave dweller for the ring were interetsing.
3,The Hobbit,"The Hobbit is an excelent book which, relates to certain occurances in The Lord of The Rings. This book has an interesting plot and story. Throughout the course of the book, there are several interesting events that occur, however, they seem to go from one event straight into another, throughout the story. Making it feel like somthing had been left out in before, and after each occurance."
5,the hobbit,I love the book it si still a great read. The download is so fast. I was able to start reading within momments after the down load to my Kindle. Love the tec. that allowed the E-book. Thank You
5,The Hobbitt - a Tolkien classic,"If anyone is going to read the J R R tolkien's The Lord of the Rings series (actually one longstory split into 3 books), I truly believe reading the Hobbitt first gets one familiar with thelay of the land. I enjoyed The Hobbitt very, very much even though I had read the Lord of theRings a few years ago. I still enjoyed The Hobbit BUT wished I had read it first. A must readfor Tolkien fans."
5,A must have for Tolkien fans,"Every Tolkien fan/collector should add this book to their list of must haves. Even though delayed in publishing, it is well worth the wait. The quality of the work and time, research that went into it, is wonderful. Great illustrations and artwork. Included is the full text of THE QUEST OF EREBOR,which was omitted from the appendix to The Lord of the Rings."
5,"No book is perfect, but The Hobbit is pretty darn close.","This book is the best, it's even better than The Lord of the Ring (I know alot of people will hate me for saying that, but it's true). My favorite thing about this book is the way that Bilbo Baggins changes from a boring, respectable hobbit who frets about not having enough hankercheifs to a clever and brave adventurer. The only thing that Tolkein could have done better was the Battle of the Five Armies, which started and ended way to hastily.That aside, this is a fantastic and whimsical adventure yarn to be enjoyed by everyone."
5,This is a classic!,"This book was amazing! Packed with fantasy and adventure, and I loved the story. Definitely a great prequel to the LOTR series! This is definitely be one of my favorite books of all time."
5,Great book,I purchased this book for a friend who is a teacher. Along with several other Tolkien fans we were able to send her a sufficient nnumber of books to allow her use The Hobbit for a reading assignment for her class. She has reported that the kids all love the book and are anticipating the movie.
5,Awesome,"My favorite book so far. as soon you begin, you wont stop reading it. Planing to read the lord of the ring which is the next book."
5,Misunderstood?,"This is directed to C. Fletcher. I respect your opinion on the book, but there's a bit of background you need on the Hobbit. Admirably, you are critiquing the book from a perspective that the Hobbit wasn't written from. It wasn't meant for the masses or even meant to be an adult book. The Hobbit was written by Tolkien as a bedtime story for his son Christopher. If you look at it from that perspective you may see things differently.I'm not a father, but look forward to the day when I can read the Hobbit to my child."
5,What more can I say?,"A great story, well told by Rob Inglis.The packaging is of the ""No Frills"" variety, but otherwise I have no complaints.Amazons price of $25 as compared to the $39.99 printed on the box, has got to be good!My copy had a fault on Disc #7. Amazon exchanged it very quickly and without fuss."
4,This book is just fun to read,This book takes you on a trip through a fantasy world filled with different creatures and beings. It is fun to read and makes you want to spend more time in that fantasy land with the Hobbits.
5,Special,"A timeless classic that will transport you to a world full of hobbits, dwarfs, elves, goblins, trolls, wizards and dragons. This is a great book for adults and teens. Let your imagination shape the images of the hero's and villain's, as Bilbo and the dwarves try to complete their quest for their treasue under the mountain. A very special novel that is required reading if you intend to continue with the Lord of the Rings trilogy."
4,I think that this book is very good!!,"The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien is very exiting and imaginative.It contains adventure, horror, trust, hope, and dispair...with a little bit of gold and greed. I enjoyed this bookimmensely."
3,The Hobbit,"The Hobbit was a striking book with lots of adventure. I liked it for the most part because it is lighter (not nearly as depressing) than The Lord Of The Rings. The quest of Bilbo Baggins, Gandalf, and the thirteen dwarves is exciting and original. Although, at times, the narration often made me feel less involved in the story. I'm not sure i like the way Tolkien writes, he puts too much detail that makes people stray from the point of the story. Overall i thought the book was worth reading more than once."
5,A classic,I bought this in anticipation of the upcoming movie because I heard that they are going to break it down into 3 movies. I couldn't believe that they were going to stretch this book into three movies. I don't want to be sidetracked so I'll keep the review to this book. If you read The Lord of the Rings this is a great pre-LOTR book that has the same adventure that you see from the trilogy.
4,This Was so Much Fun!,"Ordered this so I could get the narration before going on a car trip, and it was great. The reader had slightly different voices for most of the characters and never got them confused. Listening to this made me really excited about the release of the movie."
4,"Duh, its the hobbit.",the illustrations are beautiful. I'd recommend it over a non-illustrated version. If you haven't heard of the Hobbit at this point you probably shouldn't be allowed to have a tablet to read this wonderful e-book!
5,The Hobbit,"It's still a great story, which I hadn't read in years, and the extra add ons in the Anniversary edition make it that much more enjoyable"
1,Buyer Beware,"The actual audio for this audiobook is enjoyable (what I was able to listen to) but beware I've now purchased 2 sets of these only to find that the disks were damaged. Scratched, glue on them, some unknown substance on another. Not to mention lots of black dust particles that would not blow off easily. The discs are packed in hard cardboard sleeves. Not exactly forgiving."
1,did not look like the photo,"The book that was sent to me Had No book box that is displayed in picture, it has a different cover all together, the pages were highlighted on and marked, wow! it was in poor shape!By Far the worst book I have ever bought from amazon! The Book in the picture is not the book that was sent!! Don't buy from these folks they are Liars"
1,The hobit,The book is about a young hobit that goes on an adventurer to get rid of a ring that if you w where it you turn e ebook
5,KES Evenstar,"Bilbo Baggins, the hero of the book, is hurried out of his home by the wizard Gandalf. He went through many fantastic adventures with his dwarven companions who view him as nothing more than useless luggage. He slowly earns thier respect and survives a world too large for a hobbit. For he faced goblins, wargs(wolves), huge spiders, gulllom(repulsive remains of a hobbit), and the dragon smaug. On the journey he made friends and enemies and returns home wealthy."
5,Excellent reading!,"Obviously ""The Hobbit"" is a great book, what impressed me was how well Rob Inglis read it. Wonderful voices for each of the main characters and actually singing all the poems/songs really made me apprieciate them more!Fifteen birds in five fir trees!....."
4,"It was good, but not his best work","So after seeing the movie I had to rush home to read the book. I haven't read it in a while. Upon completion all I have to say is the story is there, but it's really hidden. Me and my dad who are both Tolkien fans discussed it and we both came to the same conclusion. The movie is better. But this isn't a review for the movie. It was harder to feel like I was there in the Hobbit. One can tell that Tolkien has an amazing story going through his mind but he just doesn't quite convey it well on paper, but the reason for the four stars is that you can almost follow his thought process. I'll probably read it again sometime in the future, but it won't be for another ten years or so."
2,The Hobbit,I bought this book for my 13 year old son. He wasn't interested so I'm reading it and like it. He said it was over his head but I don't think it is a hard read.
3,An okay book,Review by Haley. I read this book in fifth or sixth grade. It was an okay book. It got kind of boring at some parts. I did enjoy a few parts of it though. It was worth reading but not one of my favorites.
2,The hobbit,"I didnt really enjoy this book because it was hard for me to understand. I understood the characters and i could picture what they looked liked because it has good discription, but other than that the rest of the book didn't grab my intrest. The biggest reason I didn't like this book was probably because it wasn't real, like how the hobbits lived under ground. After reading this book I relized that i'm just not into fantasy stories."
2,Prepare for Boredom and Pedantry,"I must confess, I did not like the hobbit until I heard it dramatized, and then only somewhat. The tone of the book treats the reader like he/she is a child, the story is amateurish, although I am told it is symbolic. For real fantasy, this is not it."
2,The Hobbit (Collector's Edition),"I have nothing to say about the story except I enjoy it. However, I am disappointed in the edition that my husband selected for me. It has some mar's on some pages, there is nothing special about it except it is called ""Collector's Edition"" and it was printed in China, not in the USA."
3,It's ok....,"I am a fan of classic novels...that is all I read. I have never read 'The Hobbit', so I thought I would give it a try. It is ok. It is not bad, but not great either. Maybe just not my cup of tea. The constant turmoil wears on me and I find I don't want to read anymore, but I am forcing myself to finish. It is not the worst thing I've ever read...it is just not really holding my attention all that well."
4,The Hobbit,"could this book be any better, NO J.R.R. Tolkien was a writer that could never be beaten...i have read it twice before but still enjoyed it."
5,Very enjoyable,This is the unabridge verison of the book very enjoyable to listen to particularly because the songs are all sung instead of just read. My 4th grade daughter has reading problems but wanted to read the books after having seen the movies and this was a way to let her enjoy it without stumbling over pronunciations.
3,Not formatted properly for Kindle Fire,"I was very excited to get the enhanced version of this book as the first book I read on my new Kindle Fire. Unfortunately, the formatting of the book does not function properly on the fire. Audio files (Tolkien reading selections) do not appear as a link to open and many pages are missing. I realize this is more of a fault with the device, than this version, but as both are provided by Amazon, I feel other Fire users should be aware.I find that this version works very well on my Kindle App on the iPhone.Great version, great book, but Amazon has dropped the ball on formatting it properly for their devices."
3,"Fun little story, audio quality was spotty","I remember listening to this as a kid so when I was looking for an audio book for my family's Thanks Giving trip, I grabbed this up. The story was just as much fun to listen to with my kids as it had been listening to it when I was a kid. The audio quality of this 4-disk set left much to be desired, though. It would have benifitted from being digitally re-mastered--or at lease adjusted so every track was at the same volume level. I ripped these disks when we got home from our trip and ran it through iTunes' equalizer and it's just fine now."
5,It's the Hobbit,"After the movie came out I found myself drawn to re-read the original story that J.R.R. Tolkien wrote. I am so glad I did. As much as I love the movies, some of my favorite parts never seem to make it into the movies."
5,classic,"Great book and a must-read IMO. If you have seen the movie but not read the book, GET IT! You will find some things are different, but no less intersting. I loved the LOTR series and am so glad I finally got around to reading this book!"
1,don't get me wrong,"The hobbit is actually one of my favorite books. Many of the people who are forced to read this book can't understand it because it is above their level of reading. Hey, I can understand you. Wait until you're ready and try it again. Try to be Bilbo, an elf, or a warg or whatever. You can't enjoy a book if you can't understand what is said. You have to wait and try again. Sure it might not be a five star for you(which I thought to make mine)but you will know why teachers get kis to read this book. Very few kids before high school today are ready for the hobbit. this is a shame, but that is the way it is. The hobbit is only A)how good you make it out to be and B)how well you can understand it. Good-Luck *****"
1,How do you keep an idiot busy for hours?,"If you have some extra time on your and feel like pissing it away, then read this book. I love literature;however, I cannot believe I wasted valuable hours of my life on reading this so called book. I've read technical manuals that are more interesting. If there is someone you really don't like, suggest that they read this book."
1,The Hobbit,"The book is definitely for children and if they have a Kindle fine, but I cannot recommend it for adults. My book club selected it for the month of September and most of us are bored and cannot recommend this for adults."
3,Good story,"It's a good story, well told, but I did not get into it. I read before deciding to go see the movie. Will give the movie a try anyway."
4,This edition is a pleasure to read,"I was a little concerned about getting this book, since there are a couple of reviews that nitpick about the binding, the black & white illustration, etc, and argue that this edition is inferior. (I have worked in a printing studio, and can be pretty picky about my editions.) But I am happy I went ahead and ordered it, because going back and rereading the Hobbit in this edition has been a great experience. The dust jacket is printed on nice matte paper, and it feels like a new version of one of the old editions. The black and white illustrations are crisp, and are incorporated into the text at the right spots, and the color plates are bright and very clearly printed.I have not looked at the annotated version, and I am sure it is a great book if you are reading the Hobbit with a mind toward understanding the minutia of Tolkien's work. But if you want to read The Hobbit the way it was intended to be read, you can't go wrong with this edition."
5,Not Much to Say...,"I can't say much about this one that hasn't been said by someone else, but i can say this: Buy the Michael Hague Illustrated Addition. It has better illustrations than the original, illustrated by the Author"
3,From a 7th grader's point of view...,"I thought ""The Hobbit"" wasn't really a good book. But take into consideration that I was forced to read this book with my English class. I have just never really gotten into fantasy such as Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings. (I prefer science fiction.)Although, it was still hard to follow and I felt that it changed points of view throughout the book. I didn't really enjoy it and I wouldn't suggest this book.Sincerely,A 7th Grader"
3,A fantasy world of excitement,"This book is mostly based on a fantasy world with fantasy people. For anyone that enjoys to reading those types of books I would recommend. I enjoyed the thirteen dwarves and how they identified their own personalities. My most favorite person would have to have been Gandalf,the wizard. He was the one who had been experienced on the journeys and felt settled when they were faced with another conflict or situation. And without him this journey would have never begun in the first place. In chapter four for example there was an incident"
5,Great Book!,"I have been reading books of the Dungons & Dragons genre for a while. But, for some reason, I have never read theoriginator of the genre. I had seen The Hobbit on shelves and thought I sould read that, just never did. But now as hype over the forthcomming ""Lord of the Rings"" film trilagy grows, I decuded to take the plunge. I LOVED this book. As I was reading some of the hisory around the book, I learned that Mr. Tolkien had started it a bed time stories for his childeren. This is very believable, because I know I was often motivated to reading it aloud. Now, I am on to the Lord of the Rings!If you are at all interested, buy this book."
3,Read it again to be prepared for the films,Nice once more :-)The first film is even better. More action and more links to The Lord of the Rings.Read the book first and get a better understanding of the world of Tolkien. Then you will have a better experience with the film(s).
2,Don't buy the audiobook,"Please note that this review is specifically about the non-BBC audiobook version.I adore ""The Hobbit."" My first memory of my father is hearing him read the first page of the book to me as a very young child, and I've read the book countless times since then. Given my long commute currently, I've become a big fan of audiobooks. I picked this up with high hopes.What a let down. The audiobook is abridged, although the package didn't note that anywhere, the abridgement choices are odd at best (leave in Beorn but take out almost everything of Rivendell?), the voice actors seem to be interested in portraying the characters as comically and unpleasantly as possible (I want to give all of the elves in the audiobook some throat lozenges) and to top it all off, the sound quality is incredibly poor and inconsistent...."
3,The Hobbit: Better than Lord of the Rings!,"The Hobbit is a good book! The writing style was excellent, and there was enough going for it to keep any reader interested. On a personal note, I found The Hobbit to be better than any of the Lord Of The Rings stories. My only complaint, however, pertains to the length of the book. A fair chunk of it related to pure description(ie: forests, dwarves, climate), and while it's necessary to get the feel for the setting, it just simply drags a little too long. Some trimming would have worked for the better! --> 7/10"
2,The Hobbit is endless....,"When I compare this story to those in the Harry Potter series, the Hobbit fails to impress. The Hobbit seems to be endless (I am still reading it) , but not in a way that holds my interest. I can't imagine reading another book in this series.I am not a kid, I am 78 and started reading Harry Potter when I was 68. I read a great deal and I have gone back and re-read books from my past including Silas Marner and others. I read War and Peace for the first time this past fall - it is a brilliant story.I recently read The Life of PI which was a good tale.Clearly, the Hobbit and other stories by Tolkien have wide appeal - it least the films - , but not for me."
5,A great bedtime read,"What can you say about this classic? Just purchase it, and be rewarded with a rich read that will thrill you with the silky smoothness and velvety richness of the characters. When you read this book, don't read it to yourself, read it to someone, and make up voices for each of the characters. Enjoy them. Revel in Gollum's retchedness. shiver in Mirkwood, and stare in amazement at the view from an eagles claw.Don't buy this one for yourself, buy this one for your kids, wife or girlfriend and read it to them with all the energy and fervor that it deserves, and you'll be amazed at the enjoyment you get out of this book whether it's your 1st read, or your thousandth!"
5,Better than the movie,"And even better than when I read it 35 years ago. Tolkien is a master of contemporary epic. If you haven't read Lord of the Rings, try The Hobbit. You'll want to read more."
5,Love the book.,"I can only rate the book itself, as I haven't read it on my Kindle Fire HD. I downloaded it because I am a tremendous Tolkien fan and wanted this on my Kindle. The book is terrific, though my favorite is still The Lord of the Rings. So I highly reccommend the book, though I haven't checked out the Kindle version."
5,Love the book,Always been a fan of the Lord of the rings. This is no exception.A great read for many generations
4,The hobbit,I really enjoyed the book I had a hard time doing anything else I could hardly unglued myself from the screen haha I would recommend it to anyone who wants a good read
4,The Hobbit,"I never was interested in fantasy until I read, ""The Hobbit"". I think that it is book that should be read by middle graders. It gives them the opportunity to step out of reality and broaden their imagination. Although, it is a lengthy book, it should be recommened to those book lovers."
5,The Hobbit,"The Arthur's writing this book is excellent and I like their plots of story. It was a good end, that's why I gave five full stars! Also, I like how they described about the characters in this book and it gave me some of version in my own imagery. I would recommend this book to my family members and English class at college. Or if any of my friends asked me what they should read, I would recommendation this book first thing! (:"
5,"Delightful prelude to ""Lord of the Rings""","I read ""Lord of the Rings"" first but wished I had read the ""Hobbit"" first. Altho ""Lord of the Rings"" gives background as to how Baggins found the ring, the ""Hobbit"" gives a much greater in depth view to the whole adventure. JRR Tolkien has a fabulous imagination and the ability to bring his imagination to life in the pages. A wonderfully delightful book for kids of all ages."
4,The Hobbit-Revisited,"It has been quite a few years since my first reading of the Hobbit and since I have read the Lord of the Rings trilogy and seen the movies numerous times. Going back and re-reading the Hobbit as a part of working my way through NPR's list of the Top 100 SciFi books of all times was a little disappointing. By comparison to the subsequent LOTR series, The Hobbit seemed to lack a cohesives story and had a less than complete ending. It falls short in comparison to LOTR in scope, somewhat in detail and in a unifying theme other than being a unique tale set in an imaginary world populated by strange beings.All that said, I would recommend that you certainly start with this book before reading the LOTR series as I think if you read The Hobbit after LOTR you may be disappointed."
5,A lifetime love affair with Tolkiens books,Over the years (lots and lots of them) I have read this book numerous times. It never gets old or stale. I seem to always take something new away from it. I would reocommend this be read first and then continue on with The Lord of the Rings Trilogy. If you love a good story with interesting and lovable (or hateable) chracters then thiese books are a must read.
4,The Hobbit,"It is a pretty quick and easy read. Reading it as an adult, it didn't hold the same charm as when I was a child. For instance, the ending seems a little rushed.I still recommend it as a fun read.If you like fantasy it is a staple of the genre."
5,I REMEMBER THE HOBBIT!,"I remember watching the cartoon on television when I was a little boy. I was devastatingly terrified of the frog. I remember he bit someone's finger off for a ring he was wearing. I was thinking, ""He is going to die! He killed himself for the ring!"" I remember watching the frog descend into the pit with a devilish grin on his face. I can remember not wanting to see that part, but I always watched it anyway. Now that I am older, and an avid reader, I think I will read these books because I am sure that I will like the full story. Peace!"
5,Essential part of trilogy - the basis for the plot - excellent,I have read this book for years - over and over.... - I just love it! But I have been unable to find a hardback copy until now! Thank you! I will treasure the book.
5,The Hobbit,"This J.R.R. Tolkien book is a one of a kind. The adventure of Bilbo Baggins is well detailed and intresting to read. I had a hard time putting it down. The story of a well respected hobbit and his 13 companion's travel tells not only about each character but their surroundings as they continue with their journey. The story teaches that not everything is at it seems, and friendship is much more important to keep then even the greatest riches, also it shows that if you are determined then you will succeed. Tolkien's bed time story to his chidren is a novel every adult should read. There isn't much you could do to the book to make it better, and if you did it wouldn't be the same. Includes a map of the adventurer's travels with as much detail and intrest as the story itself."
5,Perfect classroom pace:),I have a few students who need this to help them read the novel. They now understand the book better and get a kick out of the different voices and especially the songs.
5,I loved the Book.,"I loved the book ""The Hobbit"", it is one of my favorite and I plan to buy ""The Lord of Rings"". It is a book about 12 dwarves, a wizard, and a hobbit (like a gnome), Bilbo Baggins, a normal well-to-do person, until he is called away from his normal boring life into a tale of marvel, where he'll use his wits to survive the miscievious, (not to mention dangerous) wilderlands on the way to lonely mountian, where lies unsurpassed wealth."
4,Great Book!,"The Hobbit has a beautifully woven storyline thta isn't hard to follow. You get to know which characters are which and what role they play. This book is a grea entrance to the LOTR Trilogy. If you're buying this book, expect a good read."
5,A Classic Tale,"Another must read, Tolkien's seminal work about adventure, friendship and discovering oneself. While the movie I'm sure will be great, I'd highly recommend reading the book first."
4,Classic,Definately a classic though the story is exhausting. A must read especially before you see the movie. I highly recommend!
1,The Hobbit on Kindle...thou shall not pass the test.,"I downloaded my favorite book, the Hobbit to my Kindle Fire. Sat down for a evening of reading pleasure before the fireplace and three chapters into the book I had to shut it off in disgust. The lines throughout those first chapters were often repeated, misplaced, or just plain missing. I could have found the One Ring faster than try to follow the bad editing mistakes from one page to the next. I do not know how the written work is transferred from book to e-book, but when they did the Hobbit, someone hit the mead a bit early. It is a shame to take any author's work and make this big of a mess of it. Stay with the RL books for this selection."
3,Not the Best Annotated Book I Ever Read,Minuses:1. Too many margin comments on the revision of the novel.2. No index in the end of the book.Pluses:1. Lots of drawings .2. No other Annotated Hobbit available .
4,Hobbits Hilarious,"I really liked this book. This was a great start to the Lord of the Rings series, and a book that pulled me in from the start. J.R.R. Tolkien mixed action and adventure perfectly while he also put a little comedy in the book without making it annoying. I suggested this book to anyone who enjoy a good action book with a small comical side. Great book and a must read..."
5,Good,Good quality book in a protective case. Nothing bad to say. Glad I purchased this one. This is a keeper.
5,Hobbit,It is a wonderful fantasy. Looking forward to the movie. I liked the development of the characters and the settings.
5,Excellent,A classic for all to read young and old. Now I will have to see the movie. Let's hope it's as good.
4,Enjoyed this very much,"I'd never read a book with annotations beforfe but I really enjoyed this. I didn't feel like the side notes destracted from the story, but expanded on reason for certain things in the story. Enjoyed reading this very much!"
1,"What's the antonym for ""page-turner?""","Okay, if you've never in your life read an epic fantasy then you might like it. But still, when I read this book I was at a point where I was reading four hundred-page novels per two to three days, but it took me hours to get through the first couple chapters. It doesn't really make sense how the dwarves would want such a bumbling fool to help them. And anyway, dwarves and Hobbits, etc., etc. aren't exactly my favorite fantasy races. Oh well."
1,this is a -999999999999999999999999999999999999999 star book,this book was worse than average than average. that is really bad. dont read it. watch tv instead. 1 star was the worst allowed
1,this wasnt a good book at all!!!,this isnt a good book and i suggest u not read it cuz it will just make u not want to read any othe tolkien books!!!!
1,TALK ABOUT THE WRONG STUFF!!!,"This book, sorry to say, REALLY SUCKS!! Maybe becuase its a child's novel is the reason i did'nt like it but let me say something if your 15 up i DO NOT recomend this book for you!!!!"
5,Great background for the lord of the rings series,"I think this is the best book Tolkien has ever written. The hobbit is the prequel of the great lord of the rings trilogy and gives it an indispensable background.This book talks about Bilbo Baggins, a young hobbit, which decides to go on a long journey, along with his friend Gandalf the wizard, to find about a great treasure guarded by the fierce dragon Smaug.This book gives the background info of most of the lord of the rings characters, Golem, Gandalf, Bilbo etc... and how the famous ring was actually found.A must have for all lord of the rings fans and for every other fantasy writing lover."
2,avoid the graphic novel version,"Unfortunately Amazon has mashed together all the Hobbit reviews. But the comic/graphic novel version is different enough to warrant it's own review pool.I bought this expecting to love reliving the Hobbit in a visual format. But that didn't happen. This adaption is just flat and missing so much of the magic Tolkien created. I suppose that's a given when you replace so much of his expertly crafted words with pictures.If nothing else, read the standard version of the Hobbit first before trying this. Reading this first will just spoil what a great book the Hobbit is."
5,Wonderful adventures,Following Mr Bagens' journey was both exciting and wondrous. His innocence and clear thinking are to be admired and enjoyed!
5,Excellent,"I had forgotten how well-written this book was. Nice use of foreshadowing. Very evocative descriptions of nature. And Bilbo was much smarter and helpful than I had remembered. People sometimes think of hobbits as comic characters, but they are really ""Everyman"" and Tolkien obviously wanted their virtues to be emulated. A book enjoyable by both children and adults."
1,The hobbit,Disappointed didnt receive the item at all and the transaction said it was successful even got an email confirmation saying my order was successful
1,won't display on Fire,"I love the book,and sent it to my wife as a gift, but since it won'y display on her Fire, I have to give it one star. Funny, because the sample displays on minejist fine(but not on hers)."
1,False Advertising,"Despite the fact that the product description says ""Kindle edition"" IT IS NOT COMPATIBLE with the Kindle Fire.I got to the end of the first chapter and discovered there are no more chapters.So I paid $12.99 for one chapter of the book, some pretty pictures and an essay by Christopher Tolkien.No audio.Worst experience with Amazon ever.I am disgusted."
2,Love the content. Hate the presentation,- quality of the printing...excellent- quality of the binding...good- usefulness for actual reading...poor. It's too heavy for that.- usefulness for collectors...none. This edition has been in print for over 20 years.- Fold out map...good in a pinch. Not a substitute for Fonstad's Atlas of Middle Earth.- content...priceless
3,Don't make things you ask for difficult,It doesn't come close to the original book that I really liked eight more words. Words words words wordswords I'm sorry I started this
3,Wait for the movie,"Like many others who have read the Lord of the Rings books, I did so only after seeing the movies by Peter Jackson. And I read them in order, starting with the Hobbit, and continuing with the three LOTR books. Among the four books, this is probably the most boring of them all, with dozens of characters, many with titles, a lot of side stories in the plot, a lot of text used for descriptions of scenery, and a lot of repetition. For those uninitiated with the lore and legend of Middle Earth, this book comes across as just another story of dragons, elves and dwarves set in a land that was probably medieval England post-Roman Empire. And there are the occasional songs and chants that break up the text. But the most important part of the story is the ring, which sets up the three Lord of the Rings books. The length and wordiness of the book puts it beyond the reach of most younger kids. Personally, I hope this book gets turned into a major live-action movie."
4,"Good writing, screwy plot.","I admit, Tolkien can write. Very well, by the way. But I didn't like the story. Tolkien is praised in every way, but he didn't catch my attention long enough. His plot is scrambled to the point which I have no clue where they are going and what they are doing. He hasn't made himself someone I admire. I would much rather read Shakespeare."
5,Fantastic page turner,I chose this rating because of the thrilling adventure and the endingWith Bilbo sitting in his living room and Gandolf smoking tobacco
5,Ready for the movie,"I like this version on my Kindle because every now and again it has drawings :-) I haven't read the book in about 30 years and it was just as wonderful as I remember! After the movie, my 10 year-old son will read it, too."
4,One of my favorite books,"I first read The Hobbit in 1980 and once I got several pages into the book, I became enthralled in it. With the new movie coming out, I wanted to read it again as a refresher and I had just bought an iPad mini, so I though I'd go electronic instead of reading my old paperback. It's definitely more convenient than carrying a paperback. My only complaint is with the Kindle app on the iPad: it doesn't support playback of the attached audio files."
5,The hobbit,It was an awesome book and I can't wait till the other two movies come out. Maybe I'll read it again.
2,LOTR is better,i didn't like this book very much. it seemed more like a children's book compared to lotr. Just an opinion
5,excellent read,"Tolkien sets the standard with this excellent book. The story of middle earth begins here, and will promise to keep you entertained through the next series."
2,"I know many will disagree, but....","Why is this book so well loved? Perhaps it gets better upon rereading many times? If I could ever make myself reread it.Now, I am a HUGE fantasy reader; if I'm not reading classic literature, I have a fantasy novel in my hand. Therefore, I should be predisposed to love The Hobbit, right? Not so, apparently. I've picked up and started the book three times. I just cannot get into it. The characters are flat and boring and their actions do not inspire or excite me. I had to make myself sit down and read it, which took a very long time with many books read in between. I am a great reader and love nothing more than to sit down with a book, so when there is a book that I must force myself to read (which haven't been all that many) then that says something to me.In some ways I envy all those who adore this book; what are you getting out of it that I am not?"
1,Really???,It's been nearly 3 weeks and it hasn't shipped yet. Are you guys printing it out a paragraph at a time and then sending it to a bindery?If it gets shipped tomorrow I still won't get it by the maximum arrival date of January 9th.
1,Don't think download to my Surface!,This is not in my book selections. I keep having problems with digital downloads to Surface RT from Amazon. Do not understand their problems.
2,meh...,"I am aware that when I review this and say I strongly disliked this book am in the minorty. The plot of The Hobbit was good and interesting. However the author was very wordy and overly desctiptive and after a while it got annoying. reading this was like chewing cardboard, flavorful cardboard, because of the interesting plot, but cardboard nonetheless.I read the unabriged edition and so the abriged vertion may be less wordy and therefore better."
3,Good but not great,"I enjoyed this read, it was fast and easy, written simply. Not as intense as the LOTR trilogy. I'd recommend it for young readers, middle school and up."
4,An obvious First Attempt,"A good story in its own right, it provides a bit of a backdrop and some foreshadowing to the Lord of the Rings trilogy, a much more ""mature"" story. The Hobbit is very obviously a first attempt at world-creating, and a bit ""juvenile;"" the subject matter is not childish per se, but the style of writing is a bit so, perhaps more suited to a fairy tale...perhaps that was his original intent?"
5,The Hobbit. A review by a BIG LOTR fan!,"This book is awesome! It' rules! In the front of the book there is a map of all the places they went! The book is really good too! In it Bilbo Baggins goes on an adventure with 13 dwarves to retrieve the dwarves' lost treasures that were stolen by a dragon named Smaug. Along the way they fight Goblins, Trolls, Wolves, and giant spiders. Bilbo and the dwarves never have to fight Smaug though. One of the BEST works of all time in my opinion and lots of other peoples' opinions. I STRONGLY encourage you to buy this book. You should also buy the Lord of the Rings because The Hobbit is a prelude to the Lord of the Rings. You can either buy The Lord of the Rings as a trilogy Fellowship of the Ring, Two Towers, and Return of the King, or you can buy all three books in one volume, simply called the Lord of the Rings. You have to get this book!!!!!!"
4,Tolkien at his best,it's a good story and engrossing. You need to have some fantasy and not be too old in spirit to enjoy it.
4,A classic tale of adventure,"One of J.R.R. Tolkien's iconic works, this is a must read for anyone about to venture into the world of The Lord of the Rings. Although written for a younger crowd than the Ring series, it is a classic tale of adventure and getting off the couch to get out an really see the world."
5,Word,"Great book, better each time I read it... story for the ages and an instant classic for any adventure lovers."
5,The Hobbit,This book is great if you're interested in adventure and action love this signed Gavin William Close enjoy the book.
5,The Hobbit,Excellent reading. This book is a classic and one you will read very quickly. I could read this again and again.
2,All That Glitters...,"The publishers have really let readers down with this 70th Anniversary Edition. While the binding is excellent, and rare color illustrations by the author have been included, the book is poorly printed on cheap paper, the black & white illustrations are appalingly reproduced (seemingly on a cheap scanner), and the first chapter of 'Fellowship of the Ring' has been crammed (in small type) into the back of the book, like the sequel to some crummy D&D; novel.Bitter disappointment. The old hardcover edition, while not very well bound, was much nicer, printed on crisp white paper with the original b&w; illustrations very well reproduced.When will publishers learn...?"
4,The best version of THE HOBBIT,"I already reviewed THE HOBBIT, but I'd thought I'd review THIS version. I doscovered Alan Lee & his paintings around Fall of 2002, wella fter I got my current editions of THE HOBBIT and LORD OF THE RINGS. D'oh. I'm still quite content with mine, but had I known about THESE versions I would've gone for them. This is the best edition of THE HOBBIT I've ever seen. I gave it four starts due to the size of the actual book. It's beautiful and all, just a little large. Best read on your lap, or sitting down at a table."
3,The Hobbit: 70th Anniversary Edition,"While I really appreciate all the corrections in the text which makes the book a more enjoyable read and the addition of all Tolkien's illustrations included as he wished, I find the quality of the paper as well as the black & white drawings very poor and not up to the honor of a 70th anniversary edition. HarperCollins would have and should have done it and the quality would match the occasion."
3,My personal review of The Hobbit,"I think the Hobbit was an OK book. It is about a hobbit named Bilbo, who lives a very scheduled life until he meets 13 dwarves and a wizard. Bilbo doesn't like adventures, but his mined is changed after his long journey for a teasure. Bilbo runs into many dangers including a dragon named Smaug, Goblins, Trolls and Wolves. Bilbo makes many friends on his journey and looses friends too. I didn't like the ending to Smaug. They made him such a big character, but he dies so quickly. If you like adventerus books I would suggest the Hobbit."
5,The worlds greatest book,I first read The Hobbit in Elementry school. Ever since then it has been my favorite book. It is a tale of fantastic adventure and is told exceptionally well by the author J.R.R. Tolkien. This book is for young and old. It is a magnificent piece of work and it shall be cherished for ever.
5,The adventure of Bilbo Baggins - a fantasy treasure!,"Not until age 40 did I get around to read the wonderful story of the Hobbit Bilbo Baggins, an unlikely hero who was picked by the wizard Gandalf to join a band of bearded dwarves to reclaim a stolen fortune from the dragon Smaug.The Hobbit is captivating without any dull points in the story line. The descriptions of the imaginary world reflect Tolkien's unrivaled creative genius.If you have not read The Hobbit I highly recommend this enjoyable work of fiction."
4,Good book,This book was very good. I found it to be a book that I wanted to keep reading. I would recommend it to everyone.
4,"Truly, A Classic, In My Opinion","The Hobbit is a great book that, in my opinion should be taught to kids in school. The book has us go on a journey with Bilbo Baggins and The dwarves that include Thorin, Balin, Fili, Ori, and some ten other dwarves and for about half of the way, The Great Wizard Gandalf The Grey. This book has definitely inspired me to go see the movie. Though I feel that at some points, Mr. Tolkien may have overdone it just a smidge with the descriptions a bit, this is definitely one of the best books I've read in a while."
3,Great book but....,I ordered this book for my son for Christmas. We've started reading it and though about less thn halfway when we noticed that about 40 pages are missing! Not planning on ordering this edition again. Headed to a brick and mortar book store to buy ths book.... Again.
5,Amazing,This book was beautifully written and I would and will highly recommend it to many people. This is now one of my favorite books.
3,can you guys help me un,this book is confusing but good so why do you like its a boring but i still dont understand for some reason
3,Ok read,"The story is not that interesting if you have watched Lord of the Ring series. The plot is very simple. A hobbit was chosen to join an adventure so that the number of members of the group is not the unlucky 13. Then the hobbit obtained the ring by chance, helped the group obtained the treasure and won an unexpected war as expected."
4,Awesome!,"The Hobbit is an imaginary fantasy world that takes you to adventures and beyond. J.R.R. Tolkien must be proud of the story that started The Lord of The Rings, without it The Lord of The Rings wouldn't be so popular. This book may be great, but the reason that I don't give it 5 starts is this: The way Tolkien writes like he's telling a story is very creative, but at some points gets just a little annoying. Reading the book may sometimes feel like your sitting in front of an old man telling a long fake story that he pretends to be real. Other than that this book is just plain AWESOME!"
3,Interesting re-read,"After having recently re-read the Lord Of The Rings trilogy in anticipation of the movie, I bought the Hobbit again since I'd lost my copy. To read it after the trilogy was an eye opener. It was obvious that Tolkien's skills in writing about the Middle Earth were much more developed in the later books. Still enjoyable, but not as visual and gripping as the trilogy to come."
5,Can't wait to see the movie,"Tolkien is amazing at each page. How can a 300 pages book contain such a surprinsing adventure? It is full of the most incredible fantasy elements: hobbits, dwarfs, elves, wizards and so on. Love it."
4,Not as good as LOTR,I liked it but not very action packed. Wanted to read it before seeing the movie. I cannot figure out how they are making three movies out of this book. In the book it just seems like not much happened. The LOTR trilogy is so much better.
3,"Great story, awkward progression","As this was meant to be a children's story originally it's understandable that this wasn't developed to take you from beginning to end in a expected transition but to be picked up each night in a segmented manner. The character dialogue which was at the time supposed to have been left to imagination rather than exact is rather awkward as well as the continual jumps from one scenario to another though they are great stories, it feels pieced together."
5,This is the one that started it all.,"This is the first one in a series that really started the entire fantasy craze. The Hobbit and the subsequent Lord of the Ring Series really launched an entire generation of Fantasy readers. I loved this book as well as the books that followed. While this is more light hearted than the ones that follow, it certainly is just as great as the others."
2,"Hobbits, Goblins, Elves and Trolls!!!","Since having difficulty visualizing these characters, I find reading this novel a very hard slog. Is it because fantasy is not my favourite genre in literature? And I need to read it as an assignment. Or is it because 'who cares' what happens to this Hobbit. 'The Hobbit' is a classic and maybe with subsequent readings, (many) I'll learn to enjoy the Hobbits adventures and its multi-levelled meanings."
2,Am I missing something?,"I read ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy before the movies came out in anticipation of them, having always put them off for one reason or another. Naturally I was drawn to this book afterwards as a way of looking for some of the background to the story. Honestly, I don't know what it is and hate myself for saying this, but I simply did not like this book. I'm not sure if it's the style of the narration or what it is, but I found it a struggle to read. I normally read until the end of a chapter and then stop for the time being, but with The Hobbit I found I could barely get through one chapter in a sitting. I know that many are going to hammer me as ""not helpful"" for knocking the book, but I just want readers to understand that this book, much like LOTR, is not for everyone. The LOTR is a much better read than this one, and in my opinion The Hobbit is really only a necessary read for those diehard fans who really need to know where it all began."
3,A starting point,"While this book is acclaimed as one of the best fantasy novels of all time. I find that the most weighing factor for this is age. Being published in the early 20's, it was certainly a groundbreaking book in its time. At this point, however, while the book is better then some of what is out there, it is given far to much esteem. I found the book, superfluously wordy. The resolution of the plot easy to foresee. And I had a hard time finishing it, I wasn't filled with wonder. Perhaps this is due to my reading a great deal of fantasy previous to reading the Hobbit. I feel the works of HG Wells and Jules Verne have weathered the ages much more effectively. So I would recommend the Hobbit to adolescents, people who are interested in getting into fantasy, and those who have a great deal of patience."
2,The Hobbit,"The book i received was different than the one in the Picture, and in much Worse condition that i expected.I was disappointed with the quality of this product. It's in terrible condition and seems as though it has been through 17 owners and should only be worth 10 cents."
3,"Good, but not great.","I guess I am one of the few, very few apparently, who was not blown away by THE HOBBIT. While the story itself is fun and adventurous, I was let down by the telling of the story. While I felt the ending was much better than the begining, the Narrator just got on my nerves. Everytime the story got interesting and exciting, this voice would come out of nowhere and say something like, ""This was not the last time that Bilbo would use his sword Sting, but that is something you will hear about later."" I know that exact line was never written, but stuff like it certainly was. I just think you shouldn't have to be told what will happen later so bluntly. Maybe a subteler form of foreshadowing is needed, or maybe I am just overly sensitive. In any case it was a good story, but not great."
5,Pure awesomeness,"A clueless hobbits, a wiry wizard, greedy, cowardly dwarves, vengeful and evil goblins, trolls and wargs, treasures, dragons, elves and the eagles. Nuff said!"
5,Great for the price,"The book was in decent shape. I knew I wasn't buying a new one, so I got what I was expecting."
5,A wonderful adventure for all ages,"I read this book many years ago when I was a teenager. It became one of my all time favorite books. I've read it to my children, and now my grandchildren have enjoyed it as well. Professor Tolkien was an amazingly gifted and brilliant storyteller. His sense of adventure, humor, wisdom, and joy shine through his writing."
3,Ashley's Review,A bunch of hobbits and a wizard go a long adventure together. They face dangerous things on their adventure.
2,It wasn't an exciting book up until the very end,"This book didn't expand my imagination, like Harry Potter does. It was slow moving, and quite uneventful, until the very end. The book didn't become decent, until it was almost over. The ending was exciting. But every event up until then meant very little to me and did very little for me. I didn't even like the style in which the book was written. I actually give it 2 and half stars, because it wasn't horrible. At one point I did enjoy reading it. I just didn't think it was the great book every says it is. However I will read the whole Lord of the Ring series. Because it is not an insufferable book."
2,Little people versus a huge dragon,"The little people win, of course, but boy does it take awhile for THAT to happen."
5,Love it!!,What can I say? I have loved this book for the past 40 years. I grew up with The Hobbit. I had the little kid's book with the vinyl record and then moved on up to the real book and the VHS of the cartoon and then with Jackson's movies and now can't wait for the Hobbit to come out on Blu-Ray (I saw it in the theater 3 times). This is the best book I've ever read (other than the Bible of course). I have it in many forms but this one is on my kindle. Love it!
5,"People, we have a winner.","This is, quite simply, the greatest novel I have ever read. This is the book that set the standard for fantasy-fiction, written by the man that created the language for fantasy-fiction. No amount of flattery can give this work of art its due credit. Read it, and you'll see."
5,one of the best!,"Of course The Hobbit isn't as good as The Lord of the Rings, but still I think it's one of the best books ever written! I strongly suggest you read it!"
4,a day in the life of a hobbit,"The author has done a great job with this best loved novel. Through journeys into the life of a hobbit named Bilbo Baggins, I was taken into a year of endless adventures. The wild journeys in the mountains of the Mirkwood Forest are full of fear. Bilbo goes through many exciting trips like fighting dragons meeting trolls,drawfs,and goblins. Bilbo Baggins even got the unwilling chance to be at the Battle of the Five Armies. While reading this book, I was taken into a world I thought could never exist, through the imagination of such a gifted author. This book made me realize that I could write about anything because the books with the most fantasy make the best page turners, and that is why I give this book four stars."
5,WOW ........... JUST WOW.,I JUST READ THIS BOOK IN SCHOOL FOR MY ENGLISH CLASS AND I WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO READING IT CUZ IVE HEARD THINGS ABOUT IT BUT WHILE I WAS READING I BECAME SO INTERESTED IN IT I COULDNT PUT IT DOWN.THIS IS AN AMAZING BOOK AND SHOULD BE READ BY EVERYONE.JUST 1 WEEK AFTER READING IT IM ALREADY STARTING TO READING THE LORD OF THE RINGS TRILOGY AND IM REAL EXCITED ABOUT THAT. READ THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,Great book to a Great Series...,"First off I gave this book a four because, in my opinion, it was not as good as Lord of the Rings which I proudly would rate a five. Writers mature, getting better in their writing style on their second/third book. Tolkien did a fabulous job on the Hobbit. Humor, confilct, but no romance. Good for children, good for just anyone. I thought Bilbo to be hilarous, the dwarfs just as funny. A true classic was the Hobbit that it will remain on my ""read again"" books forever, until I die of course. If you haven't read it yet I highly recommed for anyone who is looking for a good book to try this one out. I know others have said it, and I won't be the last but Tolkien was a master writer of our time!!"
4,Very engaging!,"I found this book very entertaining. There are those parts which I chose to gloss over (the songs, lengthy descriptions), but all in all, I was compelled to finish it as quickly as I could. I recommend this book for all who love tales of adventure."
5,"The Hobbit, a must read for anyone who has the ability!","The Hobbit is probably one of the best books ever written in history. It keeps me on the edge of my seat the whole way through, and makes me feel as if I was there, walking beside the group of dwarves or Bilbo himself. The details are rich, you can feel the awesomeness of this amazing story, and it is a _great_ prequel to the Lord of the Rings trilogy. It's interesting looking at the level of greed in the dwarves. They care for nothing but treasure, or so it seems. Another thing is probably Tolkein's writing style and how it changes from this book to the rest of the trilogy. The Hobbit is a must read for anyone who enjoys books and diving in to a great story. This book is truly amazing!"
5,none,"The hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien is one of the best fictions I have ever read. If you had seen the movie Lord of the rings you must agree that he book has to be excellent. But the hobbit is a continuation of the lord of the rings but the setting is it actually before the lord of the rings. The hobbit is such a wonderful book, everything thing about it is great not just the plot but the also the setting. Tolkien creates this whole New World for all the readers to explore as they go through the book.The `hobbit' is about...well hobbits, hobbits are half human size and the most unmagical being and wouldn't do anything unexpected. The story is about Fordo Baggins a well respected hobbit until Gandalf the Grey somehow manages the get Fordo in an adventure that he will never forget. Fordo sets of his adventure with 13 dwarfs who wants to get their treasure back guarded by a dragon. What happens next is for you to find out hope you will enjoy your book."
4,The Hobbit (a darn good book),"The main character is Bilbo Baggins, This creature is a Hobbit. They are furry footed beings with a non-adventuress personality. Bilbo was no exception, At first he didn't even think about adventures. By the end Bilbo seemed like it was his personal destiny to be in adventures. He is a very funny and intresting charater with many good qualities. I like this book, this is because it is in a whole different world where anytyhing could happen. It is a story with many high points, and suspension. Many parts where victory seems hopeless but they always get out. The only problem I have with the book is the nearly 120 pages it took to develop the story for some action."
5,"The Hobbit, a gem","I have been told that i am sad for reading the Hobbit. That it is a childs book. My mum read it to me when i was young and i read it again when i was 13. Having just re read it at the age of 15 i would say read it.Do not shoot staright into the Lord Of The rings. Read this first. Become a child again. Tolkien writes this like a kids book. But i know many adults who love this book and have read it numerous times.Bilbo Baggins is just a normal Hobbit intill one day gandal and some mighty dwarves come along and they are take him onto a quest to kill a dragon. Sounds lame doesnt it? Well dont be stupid, read it with pleasure. Carry it around in the park. Read it before you go to bed.This is a very good read and i reccomend it to all fans of adventure and anybody who is interested in Tolkien. A nice, fluffy, light read"
4,A classic,"It has been more that 15 years since I've read this book originally, so i decided to pick it up again. I love the innocence of the story, It is beautiful and intriguing. However, it is relatively easy to put down. I read 2 other books since rereading this novel, which could be due to several mitigating factors. However, what ever the reason, it is still a classic and very enjoyable."
5,A Grand Adventure,"'The Hobbit' never gets boring. In fact, it gets better with each time you read it. It's a light hearted fantasy and is, in my opinion, one of the best books ever written."
4,"If you're a real fan, this is a must have","It's great to finally have an unabridged version of this book. The narrator does all the voices, and even sings the songs. Some characters sound a little more pompous that I would have liked, but there you go. I have loaded the Nicol Williamson version of this onto iTunes, but it is heavily abridged, only 4 hours long. This one is 11 plus hours. If you (like me) are going to load these onto iTunes, get ready for many hours of work. The book is 16 disks long. And it seems that the data for each disk was written by a different person, so you will have to make many alterations. But it's all worth it in the end."
5,Good book,This book kept me fixed on something to do & it also kept me from boredom on the plane to Miami. I was reading for 5 hours when I fell asleep. I still don't understand why Tolkien didn't make Thorins death more ceremonial. All in all it was a really good book to read. I would definitely recommend this book.
5,Classic book will Share with the Entire Family,"Don't see the movie, read the book. The orignial story is far better than the screenplay and if you are used to being confused by JRR Tolkien's writing style in the Lord of The Rings series, rest assured, this is much better!"
5,Classic,"A timeless story for any age and with the movie coming out, this should get even more people hooked. Tolkien is a genius and will be remembered as a great storyteller and linguistic god. Read this before or after the movies or even without them. A must read."
3,Teen book,"I've read the Lord of the Rings series as a teenager and I remember myself being completely fascinated. 10 years later, I've read the Hobbit, after seeing the movie (The Hobbit: An unexpected journey) and it was okay, a little boring at some points. Maybe the target audience should be teenagers."
5,The Hobbit,"1 wizard and 14 dwarves, how much adventure can you get from it?The Answer is alot! A hobbit who never been on a adventure and who is convinced in going on one by one wizard named Gandalf and other Hobbits. They all head on for adventure. The Adventure includes facing fantasy monsters like Goblins, stone giants etc. The author of this book is J.R.R Tolkien, The Hobbit is the first book of the series "" The lord of the Rings."" There are 3 more books other than the Hobbit. The first of the three which is The Fellowship of the Rings recently just came out in the movie theater. The main character in this book is Bilbo Baggins a Hobbit. The adventure starts as soon as you pick up the book and read it.The Movie "" The Lord of the Rings : The fellowship of the Ring starts off with a brief introduction of The Hobbit a worth it movie to watch but before going to watch the movie maybe you should read the book first. The book is just as stunning as the movie."
3,hmm,"I am usually an avid reader, and I love most books. However, reading this was not a positive experience for me as this was required reading when I was in the sixth grade. Anything assigned by the school was bound to suck no matter how good it was on its own because it is ruined by tests, projects, and the like. I know I would have enjoyed this book more if I had read it on my own time, and I believe I will do so in the future, so I can appreciate this book for what it is (it did have good scenes in it) rather than the chore my teacher made it out to be.Thanks a lot, teacher, for ruining my first experience with J.R.R. Tolkien."
5,Wonderfully narrated library essential.,"The character voices performed by Rob Inglis were spectacular and helped to keep my interest. Be prepared for several sometimes-lengthy, mildly-operatic songs. These discs have made my work commute enjoyable and seemingly short."
5,Everything and a little bit more!,"The Hobbit is one of the only books I can sit down and read for hours. It is one of the best fantasy books ever written. It has action, magic, and unique characters. There's something in this book for almost everyone. It even has some humor in it which is rare for most fantasy books. It reminds me of the time of Merlin, with elves, trolls, Dragons, Goblins and dark wizards. The book was very well written and is an all around great story. To me, this book is ""my precious.""(Quoting gollum). I encourage you to read The Hobbit"
5,I think this is one of the best books I have ever read!,"I thought Tolkein is a wonderful author, who in The Hobbit describes things so well that it is like you are on the adventure yourself."
5,A great non-fiction adventure story.,"This book is one of the greatest books I've ever read.This is a thrilling adventure book.There's something about this book,it makes you feel like your in the story.You never want to put it down.The story's about a little imaginary creature called a Hobbit. He's drawn into this adventure by his wizzard friend.While on this adventure he comes across many odd folk and has many near death experiences.All in all it's a wonderful book to read."
5,A really excellent book to read .,This is a story about a Hobbit which is a very shy and a rather furry creature .He goes on an adventure through a jungle to retrieve stolen treasure from Smaug the dragon . On the way he meets good and bad creatures .He gets kidnapped by Goblins and attacked by wolves and giant spiders and threatened by Golum . He finally retrieves the treasure and returns home with his friend Gandalf the wizzard. This is a truly excellent story .
4,Better than when I was a kid!,"With the upcoming release of the first installment of the Hobbit movie, I decded to read the book again. What a fun read! But I knocked off one star as the audio content would not play on my Kindle Fire."
4,"Amazing novel, meh on the electronic delivery.","If you're buying this to read The Hobbit, it's most definitely an excellent purchase and you will not regret it. However, the electronic version has some features that are not delivered very well.I have a Kindle Touch and although it supports mp3 playback the audio included with this was not support on my device. Also I have not found a way to export the images and alternate art included in this edition. As much as I love black and white images, I would love to at least view them on another device such as a computer.Overall, and excellent purchase; just wish I could make use of all the features on my device."
4,Beginnings of it all.,This wonderful book filled a gap that was missing from the total series. The groundwork this book provided helped the reader go back and understand more of the whole story.
5,WOW - the best illustrated publication of The Hobbit EVER,"I was fortunate to stumble upon The Return Of The King illustrated by Alan Lee in a used book store. What a blessing! Mr. Lee brings the images into a sharp focus for the reader.The trilogy is available in a beautiful boxed set, also illustrated by Alan Lee - here's the ISBN 978-0618260584.Add these to your library. The books are beautiful on the shelf, and are wonderful to read aloud."
5,Great classic.,"As I said, it's a great classic. I really like how I didn't have to deal with marking which page I'm at and holding a 300-ish page book. E-delivery is also very nice."
5,Love it,JR R Tolkien the Hobbit is one of my all time favourites. I am a non fiction reader except for this book and the Lord of the Rings.
4,SPOILER ALERT,THE ENDING ENRAGED ME I MEAN TALK ANTICLIMACTIC SO GUY SHOOTS SMAUG IN THE HEAD AND IM LIFE ERRRRRRRRRRG SORRYDONT HATE INSPIRATEFOLLOW on twitter @JaredPendleton
5,The Hobbit,"Very good read, Tolkien always tells very good stories. I like how he goes into depth with the characters emotions and thought processes."
5,beautifull,"As always this is a classic, a most read. Physically the book is a hig cuality product. with beautifull images and a fantastic decoration"
5,My inner nerd is ecstatic,This was a perfect addition to my Tolkien collection! I loved all of the artwork and the original cover design.
3,Not charmed by the ensemble cast,"I really wanted to love this recording, but sadly just wasn't charmed by the ensemble cast. We listened to this on a road trip with the kids and the multiple voices annoyed the heck out of them (9 and 12)."
5,A book I read once a year,I have read this book 4 or 5 times and still love it. I'm waiting to see if the movie does it justice. I will read it again after seeing the movie.
5,wish I read it long ago,A lot of life makes more sense now. Many metaphors used in our culture pop out. ...go straight through and stay on the path in Mirkwood.
3,This is a kids story,"This is the first time I've read this. This comes after reading GRRM, Rothfuss, Hobb, Brooks, Goodkind, etc so when I got into this book it was very light reading indeed. I love world building and great characters and it can be difficult to have those things in a book under 300 pages. It read like a quick, young adult or kids story leaving a lot of detail out, but I guess that is to be expected in a shorter book. I just didn't get into it."
3,Its okay,Not as exciting as i thought it would be and not very detailed orientated. I like reading the books before the movie to get better insight.
3,Required reading,I only read this every years as a prologue to Lord of the Rings. But it's still not a bad read.
4,Well done,"I do enjoy Tolkien 's writing style. A very whimsical, almost grandfather's tone that manages to entice and entertain. Well done. :)"
4,The hobbit,"The Hobbit is a great book for anybody who likes adventure stories. It tells how a hobbit who inharited his dads house. When some unexpected house guest arive ,and ask the hobbit to come on a journey.ecp"
2,The Hobbit by: J.R.R. Tolkien,"Call me crazy, but I didn't think that this book was that great. I had to read this book over the summer for an English class, and I have to say, I had my doubts before I even bought it. I'm not too big into the fantasy genre--I still haven't read the Harry Potter books, and I stopped with Tolkien's works after I read The Hobbit. As I began to read the book, I felt myself drifting off and not thinking about the book. I just could not get into it. By the middle, I was forcing myself to pay attention, but still, I was unsuccessful. I finally managed to finish the book, and all I could think of, was that I was glad it was over with. I don't enjoy reading books that I have to force myself to finish, so if you are a not a fan of the fantasy books, do NOT waste your time with this book."
2,What in the world???,"This book is confusing and pointless. To many things happen at once, it far toooooooooo confusing!!! dragons, hobbits, elves & wizards just aren't my thing. Don't buy this book if you haven't read it, rent it from a library or something, cuz' if you don't like it, it's a big waist of money."
4,the Hobbit,I liked the fact that it was very easy reading light & nice I did enjoy the adventure of finding the jewels
5,The Annotated Hobbit,"Doug Anderson does a wonderful job fleshing out background information,explaining Tolkien's mythology, presenting a wide range of art works and much more in a format that is easy to read and easy to use. Reading all in this book will make anyone a minor Tolkien scholar. And the story of The Hobbit is a wonderful tale that should be read and shared not only with children but with all adults. This book is a must for any household."
3,Picture is better,"I purchased this book as a gift, and while it is nice, the pictures of it are slightly deceiving. The marbled pages are more like blue dots, and the illustrations in the book are comic-like.However, the recepient was still pleased with it and for the price, it's a pretty good deal."
5,Good information in all areas,Product was as described and was promptly shipped after the weather threat of Sandy and I was informed during the entire process.
3,itty bitty print,it is lovely and the font is itty bitty. your eyes had better be very young. for those of us even in the middle i dont recommend.
5,A must read,The Hobbit has it all adventure fantasy I could'nt put it down. It truly captivates the imagination
5,An adventure any adventurer would be jealose of!,"""The Hobbit"" is like those little adventures that you used to create in you mind as a child. Only this is MUCH bigger than that. With dragons, dwarves, hobbits, elves, wizards and more, even the non-imaginative person would love this tale. And with the vivid descriptions Mr. Tolkien added, even the non-imaginative could easily see in his/her mind what was happening to the little hobbit. I'm not giving away the story, just trying to say why I think that this tale is the best"
5,The Hobbit on CD,This is a wonderful CD. The narrator uses voices for all the characters. My students loved it.
5,"The Hobbit, great beginning","Tolkien is well known because of his books ""The Lord of the Ring"" but ""The Hobbit"" is the beginning of the story, a really good book from an awsome author"
3,interesting,"This is book is about the adventure of a hobbit, which is also the before-story of the Lord of the Ring. It was written in a very formal and traditional adventure story style that has heroes, dwarves, elves, fairies and monsters. Besides the wonderful journey in the adventure world what I also learned from this book is that people should take chances and fight for what they believed in."
4,The Hobbit,"J.R.R Tolkien's Hobbit is not only the best book written by him, but also possibly the best fantasy book ever. Bilbo Baggin's long, enthralling, and extreme adventure with the great wizard, Gandolf, and his thirteen dwarves, will make you want to read more and more. You might even finish the book in a day or two. As Gandolf and the dwarves persuade him to come with him to fight the evil dragon, Smog, and take back the gold that was once all of theirs, they are about to encounter the most exiting part of their lives.Every page of this book is a dose of excitement and action. The great part about the book is that the rising action keeps building and building drastically until the end. The Hobbit is a must read for all fantasy lovers. But even if you aren't a fantasy lover, you will still marvel this amazing book.By Will"
5,Always have been a big fan of Tolkien!,"The one book that started it allthe prequel to Lord of the Rings, I reccomend picking this up and reading it Smaug is one of my favorite characters in the book along with Bilbo, Gollum and even Gandalf as well as many others. I Reccomend buying this book!!!!!"
4,Amazing book,I'm finally reading this book now that the movie is out. The plot will draw you in from page one!
5,Great story,"I read this for the first time at the age of 36 in preparation for the movie. I loved the Lord of the Rings movies and can see why the books have such a fan base.I read on a 7"" android tablet and liked that I was able to zoom in closely to the various maps and drawing images.It was a fun book to read and I enjoyed it."
4,"Hobbits Wonderful Creatures, and a Wonderful Book",The Hobbit is wonderful. It describes a lot. It is great and interesting. There is a lot of battle and very mysterious. Calling all Harry Potter fans read the Hobbit!!!!!
4,The Hobbit,"The Hobbit is a fairly good book. It has an interesting storyline an grabs the reader throughout the whole novel. I for one read it when I was in 5th grade at school. I found it interesting and usually was a chapter or two ahead of the class. The Hobbit is a beginning book. What I mean by this is that it takes a lot of time explaining the story. This takes up a couple of chapters and I think it would have been a better book if it had built some more suspense in the end scene and extrapolated it a bit more. But otherwise, this book has few shortcomings. Other than the fact that they spent a lot of time in Mirkwood forest, I liked the book. Beorn was portrayed well. The plot line is nice, although there is a kill stealing at the end. All-in-all, I recommend this book"
5,Brilliant,"Well written, thoroughly enjoyed. The world I love to live in. Tolkien is a master of fantasy and a genius in executing such a fabulous story."
5,Nice addition to anyone's library,I've heard people say that this book is for children but I'm not sure about that. What I do know is that The Hobbit is a great introduction for anyone interested in Tolkien's writing.
4,the hobbit review,"the hobbit is a fantastic book. the book starts off with a hobbit named bilbo who has never left the the shire. Bilbo is now on a treacherous adventure looking for an ancient treasure gaurded by the all powerful dragon named smaug. bilbo is now facing goblins, hunger, wolves and powerful dragons. when they find smaugs cave the dwarves leave it up to bilbo to infiltrate the dragons lair and find his weak spot."
5,"""The Hobbit"" is the best book ever!!!","With its whimsical storyline, an in-depth psychoanalysis of its characters, and fantastic wordplay, this is truly a classic to salvage. I loved all the references to Norse mythology (Tolkien was an Anglo-Saxon proffesor)and its adventurous spirit! This is truly a book to cherish!"
4,Easy Tolkein read?,"I've seen and read Lord of the rings trilogy, while I found all of them enjoyable I felt that at times the books dragged and were difficult at times. The use of his made up elvish language and places were unpronounceable, and often forgotten when they appeared again! However the hobbitt is different!Tolkein at this point has yet to develop much of his literary prose, and deep love for middle earth folklore. Not that those are bad things, but in later writings it becomes too much of a good thing! Character description 's are kept to what is needed, especially for a larger cast as in this book. In fact I would say in lots of ways you were kept wanting more! You are told partial stories, that won't be finished for several decades, weather it's about gollum or the elves.All in all a very good easy read, that while lacks tolkeins rich folklore, does give young readers especially a fun, and enjoyable adventure!"
3,"Good stuff, bad CD's","Rob Inglis narrates this book, and has distinct voices for the characters. He is not dry and does not read in a monotone like most narrators. I found it an enjoyable experience, second only to Jim Dale in the Harry potter series.As I said I'm picky... I would have given it a 5 star, but as the recording of the audio could be a bit better, and the CD's skip here and there throughout the story, it only gets 3 stars. The Audio levels go up and down a few times as well."
2,was alright,Was not like they say it should of been. The original was way better. Always be better too.Nothing else to say about it..
4,It did well,The CD's worked and they kept me company on my commute. Good purchase in my opinion one i will continue to do.
3,Good Prequel to Lord of the Rings,Not as interesting as LOTR but a good prequel if you want to read ( or re-read) The Lord of the Rings. Give a good background to help you understand what's going on. I recommend it.
5,Magnifico!,"I know I always say this......But the Hobbit & The Lord of The rings are The Best Books I have EVER, EVER Read. When I started reading a could not put it down, although it may be fantasy, anybody will enjoy except people with NO taste in Books!!!!!! It was an Excellent, Brilliant, Intriuging, Maginficant, Melancholy, Exciting & VERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRY Enjoyable, I am nine years old but an iffinity sqaured person would lurrrrrrrrrrrrrrrve this Book, Thankyou for taking the time to read my reveiw!!!!!!!!"
5,The Hobbit,British writing at its best.....a classic! Tolkien certainly belongs in the highest echelon of writers. Recommend for all from age 12+.
4,Kindle version reformatted,This review concerns the Kindle edition. I paid $9.99! I would think at that price the publisher could have somebody edit the e-manuscript! There are numerous paragraph breaks where there should not be as well as some typoes. This detracts from the reading experience! Please fix! (the book itself is a fantasy classic and deserves better treatment than this slipshod editing)Edit 6/7/11 - looks like they reformatted the kindle version to deal with those errors. I don't know for sure if they caught them all because I haven't had a chance to look at it all - even if I had made bookmarks for the errors I wouldn't have been able to check because downloading the new version means the old bookmarks get deleted.
5,all time classic,"Wasn't sure how I'd like reading on the Kindle Fire....but it was great....I re-read the Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings every couple years, now I have it in a convienent format!"
3,INTERESTI NG,"This is a very iteresting book. It has all sorts of mysteries and surprises. Anyone under10 would like it. But according to my sister it is a little scary. Some of the adventures have to do with big spiders, dragons, and goblins."
5,Great book!,"I like this book a lot. It's a great tale, and I recommend it to pre teens who like good books."
5,my only problem with kindle books,i wish i could read the kindle books on my other ereaders. it really sucks to not be able to enjoy these books on anything but a kindle reader. the kindle reader is much too expensive for my pocket book.
3,Not into it,Tried reading this when it came out. Didn't make it through then and probably am not going to make it this time either. I wish I could because everyone loves this story.
3,good game...for the kids,"nice game, but a lot of rules to learn for the younger ones. even a little bit to learn for us (parent) for quickly learning. i would suggest that it is for 10 years or older, as they have more patience. still, in all, my daughter and wife and i had fun playing, but it's not one that my daughter brings out to play over other board games yet. maybe in time she will (she's about 8 and smart) and enjoys dragon type games, but maybe it's just a little too early for her, hence the 3 star rating"
1,"Fantastic book, absurd price (Kindle edition)","How do the publishers or Amazon get away with this? While I love The Hobbit dearly, and consider LOTR to be my favourite book, the pricing of the Kindle edition is ridiculous. It is *more* than the price of the hardback! I was considering picking up an electronic copy of the book for moments when I just want to dip into this classic and I'm away from home, but I won't be taken for a ride like this."
1,This is about the kindle edition only!,"I've read the hobbit before, and thought it would be fun to re-read it...until I saw the price. $9.99 for the Kindle edition vs. $7.99 for the paperback edition? Does this make sense to anyone? :o/"
1,Loved this Book when I was a child,"I loved this book when I was a child. It was my favorite J.R.R. Tolkien story. My niece has inherited my love of books and I wanted her to experience it also, so I got the book for her birthday. I was so happy to find it in hardcover, I had to read it in paperback. Movies leave out too much these days so I try to to get her the books first. Too bad instead of getting it in the promised two day shipping, it was late. Almost every package I get these days, that are shipped FedEx Smartpost, is late. Her mother lives some distance away but she knew how excited I was to get Brooke the book that she drove an hour to pick it up. I just wish I could have seen her face when she got it. So much for Prime two day shipping."
1,The Hobbitt,The book that was sent was not the version that was advertised. I got an older version that was not correct and therefor could not use it and had to go buy the correct version. In dealing with books for future reference I advise the dealer to mail the correct advertised version so that the customer will not feel like it is a was a waste of time ordering online.
3,Hobbit review,"I liked reading this story, especially after seeing the movie. And I kind of remember the story from when I was a child. However, it didn't keep my attention like I thought it would. I guess I'm not into this genre. But beautifully written."
3,Good book,The story is interesting that is to say the least but I would have liked to read more about the Dragon but story revolves around Bilbo and his adventures with the dwarfs
1,The word in brackets says it all.,"[ABRIDGED]?? You can't abridge Tolkien, any more than you can abridge Dickens. And who in their right mind would want an abridged edition anyway? It's not as if _The Hobbit_ was a very long book. Even with _The Lord of the Rings_, which is far longer, all the people I know that liked it say it's not long enough."
3,The Hobbit,"The hobbit was a pretty good book, and it has alot of exciting things that happen in it.Bilbo is a Hobbit that lives in a small village. One day he is at home and alot of dwarves come,and with them is Gandalf the wizard.When he finds out what was going on he is terrified. They were going on a voyage to sley Smaug the dragon, and Bilbo was the chosen one. They had no idea what was going to be in there path."
3,Only For Fans,"The Hobbit is a children's story, and while it takes place in the same world as Lord of the Rings and reflects the mythology later released as The Silmarillion it is not of the same caliber as those books. The Elves don't seem much at all like those in the other two books, there are no references to the ancient world. Characters like Bilbo Baggins and Gandalf are of course recognizable but the tone is perky where the other books are dark and the reader is left with a feeling that this is more a bedtime story for a child than the prequel to the great trilogy.One is left with no inkling of the significance of the One Ring, the depravity of Gollum, only the dwarves are clearly recognizable as the same characters we see later."
4,such a great book!,"i first read this book when i was in 8th grade (abt 10 years ago)and i fell in love with J.R.R. Tolkien. this book chronicles the adventure of a little hobbit named bilbo baggins. in the beginning he's visited by the wizard gandalf and whisked away to the greatest adventure of his life. throughout the course of the journey he comes into contact with elves, orcs, dwarves, giant spider creatures, gollum, and the One ring. there's wars, wizardry, cunning, intellect and lots of confusing place names but you'll love it anyway. this book is a classic and should be read by everyone even those who aren't big fans of fantasy."
2,kindle 75th edition of The Hobbit,"This review is for the Kindle version of the 75th Anniversary Edition of The Hobbit. Works fine on the Kindle, but audio and video that is advertised (entire reason I bought this version) does not work on the ipad Kindle app. Disappointed."
4,Great Read,"Very entertaining. Such a cute book, easy to read.My First book on my new Kindle, made it even more enjoyable"
5,The hobbit,"I liked this book becauseIt is a very exciting book. I was sad when Thorin died, and the adventures ended..I recommend this book to other nine year old boys whom like adventures."
5,The Hobbit - Read and read again,"I wanted to read this book again because, after watching Peter Jackson's film of the first part, I was not sure I had seen the same depth when I read it as a young adult many years ago. I was pleasantly surprised. Although the book had the same avuncular, almost childish, style I remembered, the depth of story and myth telling was there in spades and I could see why it was such a mine of a story for the film maker. The Hobbit should never be read as a predecessor to The Lord of the Rings, but it remains an ancillary story which is fun, and tempts the reader to explore the whole Tolkeinverse."
4,A Good Book The Hobbit,"You can not put this book down! For there is a lot of action and a favorite wizard Gandalf. You know from the movie ""Lord of the Rings.""Well I give The Hobbit four stars out of five. My reasoning for this is because some parts get dall and you can't wait untile it is over; but then agian some parts you can not put this book down because of all the action.The Hobbit is like a spin off of the book ""The Lord of the Rings,"" because it has Bilbo Baggins going on this crazy adventure with the dwarfs to get reveng on a dragon. On the way to persue the dragon they have absocales to face in which caves to exploer and such. Well I enjoyed The Hobbitand if you pick it up and read it am sure you will like it too."
3,"Good book, but not anything special","The Hobbit, the prequel to the Lord of the Rings series, is a very well written book, but I recommend it only for those who are true fans of fantasy books. This book is about the expedition of a hobbit, Bilbo Baggins, and a company of dwarves. A wizard, Gandalf, also accompanies the hobbit. They intend to travel to the Lost Mountains to recover the treasure of the dwarves from the dragon, Smaug. Tolkein does very well at describing the adventures of Bilbo and his companions, but sometimes he gets too descriptive and the book gets a little dull. Still, other parts in the book are very exciting. I ended up enjoying this book very much, but I have read better books. This book is not a light book and will take some time to read. Overall, I don't consider this one of Tolkein's best literary works, but it deserves some recognition."
5,GREAT,This was a great book. I highly recommend reading this book.Bilbo Gandalf Thorin Smauge Wargs Goblins Fili Kili Bombur
3,this book didn't really grab my attention in the beginning,"In this book, The Hobbit, it describes the adventure that is taken by a character named Bilbo Baggins. He wis not an adventurous type, but when 13 adventure seekers come to his door, he has no chance to refuse the offer of looking for adventure. in my personal opinion, i thought that this was a very boring book. it didn't grab my attention as well as i thought it would. I found it to be a great disapointment in the beginning, however, towards the middle it got to be a little more intersting."
5,the 2nd greatest book of all time,"this book is just more awesome than most imagine, i have read it 3 times and since then i have read the lord of the rings part 1 and 2 and am on part 3, but this book is so sweet it has inspired me to write my own stories."
4,"Its a book, but with audio and video",good book even though it is the umpteenth time I have read it but the first time in digital format. Had issues with the audio/video on the iPhone and had to uninstall and reinstall the book and the app more than once to get it to work right.
4,The Hobbit,I am usually not excited about reading fairy tails but my neighbor saw it at the Movie so I will have to see it also to see how they handle it.
3,The Hobbit,I read the Lord of the Rings and found that series very interesting so I thought the Hobbit would be a good read. It was on the same basis of Lord of the Rings and there was not as much action and suspence. It would be a good book for a younger child who wanted to read it then go onto the Lord of the rings. Also the Hobbit had many of the same things as in the other series so I found it repeative . It was well written so I would reccomend it to younger chilren.
5,An Excellent Read,"I read this book for a project in highschool, and fell in love with it after the first chapter. By now, I've read it more times than I can count."
2,Just So-So,"As far as fantasy books go, this one was quite disappointing. I put off reading it for years but I finally gave in. I guess I'm glad I did because it is another notch in my bookshelf. However, the characters are not compelling, and the story is not that great. Furthermore, the lack of female characters makes it an unbalanced read."
5,Great writing.,Great story. I love it very much. I enjoy reading it daily and look forward to reading more of Tolkien's books.
5,A classic tale to be shared,"The Hobbit was an excellent read. Tolkien`s writing style lends itself to the unveiling of the adventure, and keeps the reader lock in-step every inch of the journey."
4,The enjoyment of re-reading a great book...,"I really enjoyed re-reading this book. It brought back many great memories of my youth, when reading it the first time. I was happy to discover parts of the story that I had forgotten. This is a must read for those interested in the LOR series."
4,It's a classic!,We are using it to read together out loud as a family before seeing the movie. Hopefully the kids will appreciate it more!
4,great read! small caveat...,"This a very good version, however I noticed numerous typos throughout. They can be distracting. I still would recommend getting this as its a good price."
2,Wow to slow,"Slow slow slow developing read. Old book, should have read it when I was much younger I guess. Gonna stop halfway and just go see the movie, maybe...."
5,Excellent adventure,Five stars goes to a classic tale. Tolkien wrote an epic that generations of adults and kids could enjoy. I most enjoyed the aspect of friendships forged through overcoming adversity in the various adventures.
3,okay,this story for me is slightly difficult. i dont know why i just couldnt stop reading it though. just my opinion!
5,It was the best I have ever read!,fdagggfeehyer t utryj6rty5ru6t td dty hd y6ty gh t hth thd thd yh ytytj tyyh hfghf h gfxhn hgf ghf hgjf yj bn nb nb hn nb.
2,"It was all right, but I wasn't too fond of it.","I did not like it too much. It was a book I could handle. It was kind of hard to understand. I didn't find gnomes fighting a dragon too interesting, but it was written well. That is why I gave it 2 stars."
2,The Hobbit had little description in it and no main plot.,I believe the Hobbit was not a fabulouse book the way most people rave about it. The action in the book was hiddem by the words the author used and the characters could haver been described better. I reccomend the book to young readers who enjoy fantasy and adventure. I was hoping to read something more like the works of Mr. Pullman. I also didn't like the adittudes of the characters. Overall the book was mediocre.
2,Movie Tie-In Edition,"I ordered this edition because it is advertised as a movie tie-in edition, thinking it would have pictures from the movie in it. The only tie-in it has to the movie is the cover, everything else is the standard publication. I love this story and was quite disappointed to be misled."
2,not reccommended,"I found this book to be rather boring. I chose this book for a project, which turned out to be a mistake. It is not a long book but it took me over a month to finish because the wording was confusing and the book dragged too much. I do not reccommend this book, but it is a classic, which was the only reason I gave it two stars."
4,A Wild Adventure of a Hobbit,"I thought it was a really good book. It had action in it most of the time. I didnt want to stop reading it. For a book that has three hundred and four pages long, I wish it wasnt over. Now Im gonna have to read the next book to see what will happen to this little hobbit. Its mainily about a hobbit named Bilbo Baggins, he likes to be alone and smoke his pipe. Then one day unexspectedly a wizard by the name of Gandalf, comes along with 12 little dwarves asking to help them with a trouble that they have. but I wont tell you because you will have you read it and find out. Will they be sucessful or will they fail? You'll find out when you read ""THE HOBBIT."""
4,"Good, but it's no ""Lord of the Rings""","I liked it a lot, but it's far less serious and interesting than Lord of the Rings, so if you're looking for something like that, you may be disappointed. Still, for a fun adventure story, it's quite good."
4,The Hobbit,"The Hobbit is about Hobbit by the name of Bilbo Baggins. Like most hobbits he is quite predictable. One day, Bilbo is at his home when his friend, Gandalf the Wizard , and a party of 12 dwarves ask for his help to find the dwarves treasure. Bilbo and Gandalf and the dwarves encounter several dangerous creatures on their journey including a dragon, goblins, trolls, and the recognizable creature form the Lord of the Rings, the Two Towers, Gollum.I would only recommend this book for higher level readers over the age of 12. The Hobbit is a good book for a person who likes to let their imagination go."
5,The Hobbit,This book was one of the best books I've read so far. I really liked it. It kept me hooked.
5,The begging,"The idea's that led Tolkien to create LOTR is amazing in the book. Although there are several versions of this book regardless, the tales and details of this book make you feel like you are living the adventures yourself."
4,The Hobbit is a great adventure!,"The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkein is a great novel. The magical setting of the story creates a world like none other. It is a novel comparable to that of a fairy tale, but it still retains a sense of reality. The adventures of Bilbo Baggins, the main character, keep the reader interested and wanting to read more. This novel does a great job of keeping the reader interested. The plot has many small climaxes and resolutions that create a very exciting plot. This novel is also extremely easy to read. It reads quickly also, it can easily be read in a weekend. This novel is also very easy to comprehend. The plot is very straightforward which adds to the quick reading. This novel allows the reader to escape into a mystical realm which is not found to often in modern books. I enjoyed this novel; I would highly recommend it to others."
4,Great story,Could not put down Great read captivating has something for everyone adventure and flow make this a book that is must read
5,"It is ""The Hobbit"" what else is there to say?","I love this classic I have copies in book form, and wanted one for my tablet. Its a great buy I totally recommend it."
5,Always a fun read!,"This is probably my fourth or fifth time through The Hobbit and it still rewards. I read it as a kid, read it to my kids and still find it enjoyable and meaningful.I bought the Kindle version and it is well done and worth having on the Kindle. It has a few of the drawings and maps, although they can be hard to read. The text is fine and well-done."
5,Get in to the book,This book is about a hobbit named Bilbo Baggins. He takes up an adventure with thirteen dwarves and a wizard named Grandelf. He is supposed to help the dwarves win back their treasure and mountain! This book tells about their adventures and the risks they take! I think the author wanted to enchant the reader because the book has suspense at every turn! I like this book because it has suspense and adventure. I think you would really like this book!
4,The Hobbit,"The Hobbit is the story of Bilbo Baggins, a hobbit who lives in Hobbiton. He enjoys a peaceful and care-free life but his life is interrupted by a surprise visit by the wizard Gandalf.They are embarking on a journey to recover lost treasure that is guarded by the dragon Smaug, at a Lonely Mountain.On the journey, Bilbo and the dwarves encounter all sorts of villains and obstacles. They have not traveled very far when they stumble upon a group of trolls.Gandalf leads the group to a place where they can get a short rest and they pass through the country of the elves.Bilbo has outwitted a creature called Gollum, and gained a ring that makes him invisible. This is certainly helpful in battling the Giant Spiders and getting the dwarves out of the Elvenking's prison. This is about all i can say without telling the rest of it. I thought that this was a good book because I was able to get into it."
5,The Prequel That Started It All,"If the names Bilbo Baggins and Gandalf the wizard don't mean anything to you, READ THIS REVIEW, THEN GO READ THE HOBBIT! This is a fantastic story that will keep you hooked until the end. It tells the story of Bilbo, a hobbit, or midget, who goes on adventure with thirteen dwarves in search of a treasure that was taken from the dwarves by Smaug the Dragon. For most of the trip, they are accompanied by Gandalf, a mighty wizard who got Bilbo to sign up for the trip. Along the way, Bilbo finds a special ring that makes its wearer invisible. He ""wins"" this treasure from a creature called Gollum, who swears revenge on Bilbo's family when Bilbo escapes. The troop has many great adventures with goblins, elves, wolves, trolls, and giant spiders! If you've never read this book, do yourself a favor and read this A.S.A.P. Then go read Lord of the Rings."
2,Didn't translate well onto my Kindle,"Nice to have a digital copy,.. But don't spend money on the digital special anniversary edition. Maybe I jsut need to upgrade on to a fire or something...."
5,Great for kids learning about J.R.R Tolkien,"My 7 yr old son became interested in the Hobbit after a Lego catelog showed up with Lord of the Rings and Hobbit themed lego sets. He tried to read my copies of the LOTR and the Hobbit, but it was a little to much for him. I was excited to find a graphic novel version of the Hobbit. The pictures are engaging and keep to the spirit of the story. I know it misses some details that you will only get from reading the originals, if he loves the story as much as I do then he will eventually read the full length novels when he is older."
5,brilliant,I've read this book when I was 12 years old or something. It was in my native language (estonian)... and it blew my mind... this human being... John Ronald Reuel Tolkien... has created such a wonderful realm... that I don't know how to describe it. I feel I am indebted to him ... forever.
5,Wonderful book,"Pages are nice and solid, beautiful jacket, and great illustrations. A must have if you don't mind hardback books. A must have for any Tolkien fans. The book has a nice breakdown of illustration descriptions and languages."
4,A Great Read Before Lord of The Rings,"I read the Hobbit back in high school, then recently re-read it prior to the movie coming out. It's a very enjoyable journey into the world of J.R.R. Tolkien, written for a younger audience than the Lord of the Rings series. Because of this, I'd have to mark it lower than L.O.T.R., but overall is a fine read. It tells the story of Bilbo Baggins, who makes an appearance in the LOTR series as well.If you love LOTR, you will really enjoy the Hobbit. If you read the Hobbit first, then LOTR is jsut, oh so much better on all levels. I recommend reading the entire trilogyThe Lord of the Rings: 50th Anniversary, One Vol. Editionthen catching the incredibly produced and directed moviesThe Lord of the Rings: The Motion Picture Trilogy (The Fellowship of the Ring / The Two Towers / The Return of the King Extended Editions) [Blu-ray] . But definitely read the books first. They will make the movie make much more sense."
5,the classic fantasy novel.,This is a feature and illustration packed edition of THE fantasy novel. The only drawback is that on the kindle the audio tracks of Tolkien are not enabled or simply unavailable. Great edition.
5,Action Packed Adventure!,"Love this book! So much action and adventure! I hope the movies do it justice, I can't wait to see the all the characters and Middle-Earth in life form. I recommend this book!"
5,good read,Last read this in HS- many yrs ago. Good to read after the movie! Just started it the other day
5,Classic and easy going,"One of the most easy and rewarding books I have ever read. It breaks away from going too deep into outside lore, and focuses deeply on the specific characters. I re-read it just before the new movie came out, and was glad that I did. I would suggest this to be a must read for any fantasy lover."
3,The Hobbit To the End and Back,"""In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit."" Who wrote this line? J.R.R. Tolkien did. This book is a fantasy adventure about a band of dwarves, one wizard called Gandalf, and a hobbit called Bilbo Bagins. Together they embark on a journey to retrieve a lost treasure form a terrible dragon. On their journey they face Trolls, Goblins, and Wood Elves.This is one of my personal favorites. This is a fantasy adventure like no other. I would recommend this book to lovers of fantasy adventures. This book is a prelude to Lord of the Rings trilogy."
3,THIS IS FANTASY I LIKED,"I am not a fantasy/sci-fi reader, and I did not overly enjoy Tolkien's extreme run-on sentences. I admit that I had to read more carefully. But aside from those issues...I Love This Book! Tolkien talks directly to the reader, interrupting himself every now and then to define a term, give a background fact, and sometimes to show the reader just how anxious he is to tell us the ending before we get there! Pictures are easily created. Puns are very intented. Characters are realistic in their personalities and traits. Any reader who gives the book a chapter's chance will become involved in Bilbo's adventure of a lifetime."
3,Love the Hobbit but...,I love the Hobbit (could read it again and again) Unfortunately I find the reader (Rob Inglis) rather dull and pretentious. I would have enjoyed a less classical and more dynamic and animated reader.
5,Best ever,One of my all time fav's. it should be a must read for everyone. For sure this ought to be mandatory prior to reading or watching The Lord of the Rings.
1,BORING,"Yes, I had to read this book in school. It was very very boring. It was about a hobbit named Bilbo Baggins. He went on a big andventure with a bunch of dwarves and a wizard. I would not recommend this book to anyone. I didn't read this collector's edition, but I don't think there is much difference."
1,Ridiculous,"After writing LotR Tolkien should have hunted all of his Hobbit books and burnt them in a giant bonfire.This book tells about the adventure of Bilbo Baggins, Gandalf and a number of Dwarves (I can't remember the actual number, because all the dwarves were so similar).This book is so silly, juvenile and ridiculously written that it is completely unprecedented.People are defending this book by saying that it's a childrens' book unlike LotR. Well here's some news for you. There are some actually good childrens' books out there.Not all would doom this 1 star, but no way would this book be receiving so many 5 star reviews unless it was written by Tolkien.I'm not saying someone couldn't like it, but from any sane point of view it just isn't *good*. Period."
1,Warning: Don't waste your time on this book!,"Warning: Don't read this book. It'll scare you from reading any other book The Hobbit stinks. The Hobbit is terrible. The Hobbit is down right boring. It's hard to follow and is extremely dumb. It faces in on Bilbo Baggins, a lonely hobbit. Suddenly, he is left with a band of dwarves, who take him on an adventure. All he worries about is that he left his handkerchief at home. While he faces evil orcs, goblins, and wolves, he gains the respect of the other dwarves with the help of a magic ring. He also ends up in mental challenges as well as physical, such as a riddle contest with Gollum, a creature from the sea. The last few chapters about facing the dragon Smaug, are very hard to follow. To tell the truth, I probably don't know how it ends. I strongly recommend that you do not read this book. I think that J. R. R. Tolkien did a terrible job of tying the book together. Unless you want to be bored to death, do not read the famous The Hobbit."
3,Truly a Classic,"A truly wonderful book, and THE cornerstone for fantasy. A must read for true fantasy fans so they will understand Tolkienian references with other writers.Kids will love because it is an easy read. Parents will love it for it is truly a good clean story. Adults will enjoy it for the historical value and amusing style.The only thing I would criticize is the simplicity of the story. Too many details are left out for my taste (of course that is part of the magic, it requires you to use YOUR imagination to flesh out the story!), but I think that is mostly due to the looooooooong storylines I have read in the last 3 years.Enjoy!"
5,Yay!,Had to read again before the movie comes out. Worth every penny and really fun to hear parts of it aloud.
4,Amazing,Couldn't put it down. Great read for anyone who loves Lord of the Rings. Better then the movie by far
5,Quite interesting and surprisingly easy read.,"I choose this rating because I am a ""Lord of the Rings"" fan. This book gives the pre-story to that series. book I found this book to be an easy read, Maybe because I am already familiar with the story.I would recommend it to any who enjoy ""The Lord of the Rings"" stories"
4,Liked,Not sure how suitable it is for three films...but I really enjoyed the story nevertheless. On to The Lord of the Rings next!
5,Love Tolkien,"Loved this book for my Kindle, so easy too! Right to my kindle, no plugging it in and doing anything extra. Just a simple click. Although, it would be nicer if there was a way to double check things with the whisper net thing before you buy it. I ended up buying another book first cause I didn't understand how simple it was. I LOVE my kindle and I love how easy it was to get this awesome book. It's a nice easy read, you don't have to know everything about the books because it's just the beginning. That and just a warning for the reader - you'll want to read the rest of the books!! Not to mention just more Tolkien!"
5,An Epic Fantasy that will blow your mind!,"This great fantasy is about one hobbit's journeys and adventures into the unknown. This is a fantasy thriller that kept me on the edge of my seat. Bilbo was the hobbit's name and he came across orcs, elves, goblins, and trolls. If you like books about things that you don't already know read this EPIC Fantasy by J.R.R. Tolkien. If you like the Hobbit I recommend the rest of The Lord of the Rings series."
5,A True Fantasy,Tolkien uses such vividly descriptive language that you nearly feel that your a part of the entire adventure. A beautifully written story that deserves its pedestal position among classical world literature.
5,A great classic with delightful characters.,"A cheery hobbit named Bilbo is confronted by a wandering wizard and a truckload of dwarves, then suddenly finds himself trekking across the wilderness in a search for a dragon's treasure! A classic if there ever was one. The ironic adventures and exciting creatures give this fairy tale a very enjoyable edge. One can never grow tired of reading this novel, and it is a great book for all ages. I salute Tolkien for his masterpiece!"
4,"A great fantasy story for children, young (&immature) adults","A pleasant fantasy story that played an important role in developing the genre. For those readers who need something more to sink their teeth into, I'm with you. Though hobbits and dwarfs and such are cute, in a way, the themes are basic and there are deeper and richer sci-fi and fantasy stories now."
5,Classic Fantasy that all should read,"For any fans of fantasy, this is a must read as many fantasy authors looked to Tolkien's masterpiece for inspiration. Good read for early teens to adults."
5,Great Read,"Nice to read on the Kindle! I have the book, this is a first for me, the Kindle was nice change of pace on re-reading this story!"
4,Best book ever,"This is the best book I have ever read, and I have read many good books. I recommend reading this before reading the Lord Of The Rings series for more enjoyment."
5,Holy Angels Review,"Michael H. I think it was an interresting book because it is magical, with wars, elves, dragons, goblins, hobbits and wizards. I think this book is very enjoyable to read. I would recommend this book to any reader who likes to be taken away to another land which had creatures that have majical powers. The main charcter, Bilbo, is a hobbit that writes about his adventure, has fun, loves company and sometimes is couragous. His story is one of mystery over this magical ring. The power that that the ring contains helps Bilbo during his advendture in Middle Earth. This book is an introductory to the series of The Lord of the Ring."
5,My kindle to the rescue,"I started out reading this book on a paperback. I hated it, the font was so small. I bit the bullet and actually paid for a book and I am thoroughly enjoying this book now. I love the fact that pictures show up on my kindle too."
5,The Beginning,"Another great Kindle Edition at a good price!I first read this tale many, many moons ago - at the recommendation of my 7th grade English teacher. I have read many, many books since then - some great - some good - some just ok... but I can easily say that none of them have I read more times - nor loved better than this one. Bilbo's story is the classic fantasy yarn. The quest, the surprising courage and wisdom that comes in most unexpected packages - the sheer magic of it all - makes it a pleasure to read every single time. As the movie(s) are getting ready to come - and a wider world and audience will see Bilbo and Company's great adventure - I hope there are still some 7th graders (or younger and older) out there who will pick up the book for the 1st time and watch Middle Earth unfold on the movie screen of the mind! For my money it's still the best one out there."
3,Misleading,"The enhanced edition of The Hobbit looks like a wonderful production, including a bonus of audio readings by J.R.R. Tolkien himself. Unfortunately, the product information fails to mention that the audio might be difficult--not to say impossible, depending on your software--to play. I have a basic Kindle, which of course doesn't have audio, so I purchased the edition for my pc Kindle; the audio will not play, no matter what existing software I try. Nowhere in the product information or the product itself does it say what software you need to play the audio. I am left with an annotated copy of The Hobbit, which I already own in hard copy. Nice, but..."
5,Whats' not to love??,"I love reading old books. The hobbit is another childhood favorite of mine. Some day into the hill at the back of my property , I shall build a hobbit house for fun."
4,Great!,Story was awesome and written very well. I enjoyed reading the story and look forward to reading the rest of them.
4,The road to Hobbiton,"This is a classic, a must read for anyone who loves fantasy. From start to end, the Hobbit never seases to amaze and delight. With a cast fo characters, ranging from Gandolf, a wizard to Smaug, a dragon, the reader is taken through the ups and downs of the adventure.I would have to say that my favorite part was where Gollum was challenging Bilbo, the hero of this book, to a game of riddles. Here is where the real story begins as Bilbo finds a ring, that Gollum refers to as his precious.This is the best written and thought of book of its kind. A must read for anyone. I give it four stars."
5,A groundbreaking classic that has stood the test of time!,The Hobbit is a true classic fantasy tale. It can spark the immagination of the young and the old. In this respect it is much like the Harry Potter series. I am 33 and I enjoyed Harry Potter as much as any fantasy tale. The Hobbit was groundbreaking in that it paved the way for generations of future science fiction writters. It was written in 1937 and to this day it sparks the immagination of the young and the old. It is a great book to introduce young minds to reading and it is a fun tale you can later enjoy as an adult. The Hobbit has passed the test of time. Not too many books written in the 1930's are still so loved as the Hobbit. It is a treat that should not be missed.
5,Classic,"I fell in love with the cartoon version of this movie as a child. Now, as a teenager I can appreciate the book all the more, and I thoroughly enjoy every moment of Bilbo's adventure. 5 big ol' stars!"
5,Great book,A great read from a great author. I couldn't put it down. A must own for all fantasy epic aficionados.
5,Great book Perfect for family read,Awesome book to read with your family. Definitely get it you will LOVE the book. It is worth the money.
5,Epic book,I love this book mainly Bilbo long live the hobbits and all dwarfs must read you must : ) it rocks
3,Beautiful Book - OK story,"I realize I will be tared and feathered by the hordes of Tolkien Fans but it must be said.... I've read better. The collector's edition of the Hobbit was a gift for my birthday...the book itself is beautifully bound with wonderful illustrations. I'm not saying that I hated the book. It had a wonderful story with interesting ideas and characters (and is a must read for anyone who wishes to attempt to read the Lord of the Rings ""series"" in it's entirety), but (yes there is a but here) the story can be slow going at times not to mention the big made-up words and names that totally through you off. True, when dealing with a new, made-up world you have new words/names , but you don't need to make them 14 letters long and unpronounceable.So what am I saying? If you want to ""collect"" books just to say you have them...buy the leather-bound collectors addition. If you want to read a well-written book...go read The Sword of Truth."
3,Entertaining,"It is very exciting to follow up to half of the book, but eventually becomes kind of boring. Maybe I should have read it at 13. But it is amusing."
5,Still good after all these years,"I read The Hobbit for the first of many times over 25 years ago. I devoured it and the Lord of the Rings trilogy multiple times. But then I tried to get through The Silmarillion and haven't really touched the books for over a decade after that. That's kind of a shame now, because I missed getting my kids into this wonderful story earlier.Who doesn't want to go on an adventure?Okay. Most hobbits don't, but most children do.I would encourage everyone to read this book again before seeing the new movies. As visually spectacular as they are, they do deviate from the story in the book in odd and seemingly unnecessary ways. It's fun to see and notice them.I am not a fast reader and it took under seven hours to read The Hobbit. I am a little shocked that the three new movies will be longer in total time. Read the book before seeing all three movies!"
5,Who Wouldn't Want To Read This !,This is quite frankly the best book I have ever read. It keeps you spinning until the very end. I would and have recommend it to anyone.
4,Hobbit,I recommend it because reading develops much more complex and awsome scenarios than the movie does. This book is valuable item of my home library.
3,My Review on the Hobbit,"The Hobbit was a story about a little hobbit named Bilbo Baggins. He goes on a faraway journey accompanied by thirteen dwarves and a wizard. The purpose of the journey is to find the lost treasure stolen by a fierce dragon named Smaug. Along their journey, Bilbo and the thirteen dwarves go up against Goblins, Trolls, Elves, and other wild beings amoung the forest. If you are into stories about journeys and make believe, you should read the Hobbit. I'm not really into these kind of books, but it was pretty good."
4,The Hobbit Review,"The hobbit is a book about a simple little hobbit named bilbo who likes to live in his cozy little hobbit hole. One day thirteen dwarves and a wizard come to his house for an adventure. They go through many small adventures while seeking their final destination, a very large treasure under a mountain. On their way there, they meet many new people, some nice and others not so nice. The end up being involved in a great war, and recover the treasure. Finally Bilbo gets to go home to his little hobbit hole.I think this is a mediocre book. He puts a lot of details in that you don't really care about. It kind of starts out slow, but gets better as you read it. I think that it has an abrupt climax that comes out of nowhere."
4,Hobbit,I think this was a very good book. If you like a fantasy book with lots of action and a good cast of characters you should get this book.RJ
3,"A good fantasy, but a bit confusing...","This book had a good story line and plot, but it was hard to undderstand because it was written mostly in Old English. The best part was the part with Gollum in it. Read ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" after it to make it complete."
5,An amazing novel,"I am sure there are many reviews for this book already, but I will heap more praise upon Tolkien's genius. The Hobbit relates the reader to the character. The story is also adventurous and exciting. I remember the first time I read the book in fifth grade, it thrilled me then, as it thrills me now when reading for the third time. A land of hobbits, dwarves, dragons, and wizards. The adventure is suspenseful and well worth the time. After reading the rest of Tolkien's books, I appreciate the Hobbit even more. It is a small part of his work, but the detail he uses to weave a creative plot is astounding."
5,The Hobbit,"The story "" The Hobbit"" is written by John R. R. Tolkien. It is about a small hobbit who lives in a small hole.Oneday Gandalf, a magician, and 12 gnomes leave Hobbingen, the village where they live, to have a big adventure.You get information about orks and big spiders which are in a forest and fight against Bilbo and his friends. But Bilbo ownes a special ring. If he puts the ring on his finger, he becomes ...I don't want to say to much about this fantastic book. Read it yourrself !!You feel, as if you would live in another world which is full of magic and action."
3,Audio files,"I can not play the audio files, even on my tablet. It is not a ""enhanced"" book. Sad... But short ils always good."
1,the hobbitt,The movie is probably good but for me the book stinks . With a capital S. Tried to read it twice. Each time got farther but to childish of a story. I read in the paper it was a rush job for his daugther or it was his granddaugther. Movie makes millions . Think about it. It don't take a lot to please some people. One star not low enough !! Give me back my money.!!!
5,Excellent service,Ordered this for my daughter's reading list to compliment the book she was reading. Excited to begin.
3,Okay..,"I had to read the Hobbit for my advanced English class.. Lets just say that this book and I don't get along. Its well written and has a good plot. But its just the way the narrator and characters speak confused me whole time. It deserves stars for just being an ok book, but I would never read this of my own will."
5,"The Hobbit, and the three part series.","I have read the Hobbit. It was an uplifting tale and I recommend this book for children, teenagers, and adults. It is a fun book to read and I also recomend that you continue reading it into the three part series. Lord of the Rings-The fellowship of the Ring(part one),The two towers(part two), and the Return of the King(part three). Each book is tied to one another in a continuous plot. These 3 books are page turners as well, filled with suspense and uncertainty. The charactrs are not your typical heroes also. One does not know what to expectfrom each, yet you undersand their own unique personalities. They are very human in nature, even the wise Gandalf. The three part series is more complex in plot also in comparison to the Hobbit."
2,BORING,12 year old girl hereI personally hated this book. It's written in such hard language to understand. I would not recommend it. :(
3,"Hobbit, not my kind of tale","I purchased this because my grand sons are real Tolkien fans, have read his books and seen the movies.I wanted to be able to talk with them about both the book and the movie. That is now possible, but I don't think that I will read the rest. I don't really enjoy this kind of book."
3,"The ""hobbit""",The book had a good story but most of it was just walking through the woods the movie was better
3,Not crazy about fantasies,"Would not have read this if not for book group. (We invite the kids to our group in December, thus this choice.) Will never reread and have NO interest in Lord of the Rings after reading this because all those in the know say this is the most ""realistic"" of all the books by Tolkien. For years I felt guilty that I had not read this classic. It is just not the kind of story I can get into.All that said, I did read to the end and found parts very enjoyable. Was distressed that all the adventures and learnings by the Hobbit did not bring any change to those around him."
5,Perfect Pocket Book,"With the premier of the HOBBIT movie just around the corner, this small book is the perfect size to carry in pockets to cafe's fro reading .... very well constructed gold edges with crisp text and fully revised to current publication of this amazing adventure from JRR TOLKIEN"
5,nice book,"super cool book, very interesting and enjoyable to read, I strongly recommended it for people from all ages groups.I am sure kids and adults will enjoy this amazing piece of literature."
5,Perfect!,I love all related to J.R.R. Tolkien so this book is just perfect for a getaway and transporting to another fascinating world!
1,the most boring fantasy book i have ever read!,"i read this book in my seventh grade english class, and personally, i wouldn't recomend it to ANYONE! maybe it is jsut me who doesn't like fantasy novels, but i mean, seriously....the hobbit? gandalf? they were such boring characters, it was as if a ten year old coul've made up these characters. i have written many essays on the hobbit about bilbo baggins, and that he is a heroic character,but to be honest, i would NEVER do it again. it was a waste of my time to read such a bad book! but if u do want to read it, then all i can say is, you will have to see for yourself what u will think of it! enjoy?"
1,YYYAAAAAWWWWWNNNN,"I think that this book is THE WORST BOOK THAT I HAVE EVER READ! If you see this and are thinking of buying it, DON'T! I chose to do it for a book report because my mom liked it (what's wrong with her? ) and literally had to force myself to read it! I almost burned the stupid book and would have if it were mine. I was looking through the reviews for Dragons of Autumn Twilight and someone rated it badly because it was no ""Hobbit"" of ""J.R.R. Tolkien"" and I'm thinking THANK GOODNESS! Read Dragonlance or Tamora Pierce instead."
1,The epitemy of Fantasy,"This ""book"" is a travesty to everything ever written. Swoar, lil' fools wack for REALL. J.R.R. Tolkien is clearly a man of minimal intellect and an insufficient grasp on what a a real novel is composed of. Boy, ain't nuffin' but a playa-hatin scrub!. Daniel Miller, anonymous in Kentucky (MMS!)"
1,Horrible!,This is such a horrible book. There is no action and Bilbo Baggins is the biggest a$$ in a fantasy novel ever.
4,Cute!,"I very rarely use the adjective ""cute"" to describe a fantasy book but this was! J.R.R. Tolkein made me fall in love with his little hobbitt and even though the story telling style was different from the modern fantasy I've read, I became used to it and found myself enjoying it.The action and in this novel never ceased to amaze me. Some authors pack in too much, making the story seem like a disorganized whirlwind while other authors remain painfully stagnant throughout the book. Tolkein proves his talent with well paced action along with very good character development.Although ""The Hobbitt"" is written in a different vein from most books written today, it was refreshing and I found myself adapting to it with pleasure. On to the Lord of the Rings!"
3,It just is not the same,"Although not as bad as any video game or movie, this audio version still can't live up to the high standards set by tolkien fanatics, but on the other hand, every Tolkien Fanatic has allready read The Hobbit so there is no problem there. The book might however be good for the family vacation, my dad read me the hobbit, and instiled a life long love of reading in my mind, so this tape could be valuable to the lazy father... Just a thought!"
4,GREAT,"This is a great book full of fantasy and adventure. I swear as soon as I finished this I immediately went to get the fellowship of the ring. I couldn't put this book down and would recommend it for everyone out there. Now if you excuse me, I have to catch the first hobbit movie."
4,Great Kindle read!,I don't know what is soo fancy and enhanced about this. But it was clean and easy to read on the kindle. I would recommend this to anyone who was in to LOTR.
5,Beautiful book!,"This is a great printing of The Hobbit - with color illustrations from the author, nice typography and page spacing."
3,Good but no LOTR,a good prequel to LOTR but not in its league. Does not engage or draw you in like LOTR but still a very enjoyable read.
4,Great classic,"A book full of great adventures and mysterious tales. A must read for all! My only wish was that I read this before the Lord of the Rings book, which were also great."
5,Wonderful,I remember the movie from when I was younger and now i have finally gotten to read it. Love it and will always re read it.
5,how i loved thee,"What an excellent book!Great plot and awesome characters!I should have read this years ago instead of waiting until 31 yrs old! OH well, never too late hmmm =)If you are looking for an easy but fun read, give this book a try!I am onto the series The Lord of the Rings now!!"
4,A fun and engaging read.,"""The Hobbit,"" also known as ""There and Back Again,"" is a fictional fantasy novel by J. R. Tolkien that follows the journey of hobbit Bilbo Baggins from his carefree and cheery residence at the Shire to more mysterious and often sinister lands beyond, in the hopes of sharing a treasure guarded by the fearsome Smaug, an ancient and legendary dragon that draws chills from almost everyone who hears his name.It is believed that Tolkien's own personal involvement in World War I had significantly influenced the formation of his novel, and his incorporation of adventure, wits, romance, personal growth, and self-discovery blends itself to deliver a captivating journey that explains the wide critical acclaim it received when first published in 1937. In addition to winning a prize from the New York Herald Tribune for best juvenile fiction, the novel was nominated for the Carnegie Medal."
4,"Mystical, enchanting, funny","The Hobbit is a kinda fairytale about Bilbo, the hobbit, and his journeys throughout the world, to retreive the dragon's treasure. He meets many strange and wonderful characters along the way, each adding a twist to the story. I recommend it to 12- year olds."
4,Hobbit,"Hobbit - good read, moved right along. Good descriptions. Good foundation for the rest of the series and or books.Hobbit"
4,Great book,The Hobbit is a classic book and I really enjoyed the audio version. Rob Inglis has a great voice which is easy to listen to. He does the characters well and the songs better. There was not 1 part where I lost intrest. I highly recommend this audio cd.
3,The Hobbit,"Book was new like description said, however, the entire hardback was slightly bent in the middle. I couldnt bend it back."
5,Review for the hobbit,Was amazing what a well written book can't wait to read the Lord of the ring series! :DI hope that the fellowship is as good as this!
5,Correction on The History of the Hobbit Author,Correction from a previous review:The author of The History of the Hobbit is John Rateliff not John Ratcliff.YOu will find it easier to find in a search engine.
4,It's Tolkien- What's not to like?,"Heard about ""The Hobbit"" since I was in high school - that was when dinosaurs roamed the earth freely and coal was still green and leafy- and yet had never read it. Then the movie came out and in order not to seem to far out of the main stream read the book.I really liked it. The plot was straightforward and easy to follow. There were some surprises. What did surprise me- and what did not translate into the movie- was the clever, convoluted and crafty writing style J. R. R. Tolkien used to capture the reader's imagination and unleash the power of the mental image. Would it be pretentious of me to say that it is more how the book was written than what it had to say that fascinated me? If so, forgive me. It's the truth. If for no other reason one should read 'The Hobbit' to see how effective the older style of writing can be."
4,Slow to start.,"The beginning of the book had me wondering why it could possibly be so popular. Then, I got to page 80 and was sucked into Tolkien's world for life. I will always be a fan."
5,"AN AMAZING BOOK, THE HOBBIT","I am an avid reader and I read The Hobbit when I was in 4th grade. I immediately loved it. It is much easier to read than The Lord of the Rings. Bilbo was funny, and I liked the riddle game between Bilbo and Gollum. Fat ol' Bombur was humorous,too (mostly by the fact that he was so lazy and fat). I felt sorry for poor Bilbo. He was forever wishing to be back at home in his nice hole, the kettle just beginning to sing. The Hobbit definitly showed Bilbo's Tookish side. I would reccomend this amazing prelude to The Lord of the Rings triloqy. The amazing thing about J.R.R. Tolkien is that he didn't just create a few characters, he created a universe! He made cultures and empires, from the men of old to the graceful elves, from the evil orcs and goblins to the peaceful and food-loving hobbits. This is, in my opinion, the best book of the century. This is a must have book. If there is an avid reader in your family who likes fantasy, buy them this book for Christmas."
5,A Fantasy Masterpiece,"J.R.R Tolkien has written a masterpiece enjoyed by both children and adults. The Hobbit is a classic fantasy adventure of an ordinary, well-respected hobbit going on a dangerous adventure. The Hobbit shows what a just one tiny little hobbit can do. In the beginning Bilbo Baggins is unaccepted by his companions and is considered to be useless, but the discovery of a magic ring changes this all. Now Bilbo has the power of invisibility, making him an excellent thief. He helps the dwarfs escape from trouble at the time they need him most. The Hobbit explains how Bilbo got the one ring and introduces a few characters from The Lord of the Rings series. The Hobbit is an exciting story about thirteen dwarfs, a hobbit, and a wizard going to reclaim their fortune from an evil foe."
3,"The Hobbit, Action Packed, or Boring?","The Hobbit, by J.R.R Tolkien, is a very interesting book, consisting of imaginative characters, plot line, and story delivery. Although the book had many of the good qualities a book needs, the traveling sequences become long and boring. The reading gets tough in those areas.Through most of the book, however, I was sucked in by the battles, and the ending face-off against the hordes of creatures.This book was, for the most part, an easy read. 3 stars."
4,I have always enjoyed this story,I wanted to re-read it before I see the movie. This is a nice compact edition I bought before my Kindle arrived.
5,The Hobbit,This book was the bees knees. I couldn't put it down.I recommend this book for everyone. Can't wait to watch the movie
4,The Hobbit Review,"I thought this was a pretty good book. So glad I finished this before the movie comes out. If anyone wants a good book to read, read this one. Definitely lives up to the hype about this wonderful epic that Tolkien created."
5,Hobbit revisited,"I have not read this book in 25 years, but in preparation for the movie, i read it on my Kindle and enjoyed it immensely"
3,Maddy's Overview,"I am an avid fan of Lord of the Rings and I consider myself to have a vivid imagination. My imagination went on this ride of fantasy and wizardry full of delight and dread as well. This is the first novel of this type that I have read, usually I just love to watch the movie version of these types of stories. I can truly say, however, that I enjoyed the journey of the hobbit and hope that the movie will be as entertaining as the book itself."
5,Same book annoying cover,I love the hobbit and didn't have my hard copy handy so it was nice buying the kindle edition for $3 during cyber Monday even though I don't like movie tie-in covers.
5,Amazing Book. JRR Tolkien is amazing.,"The Hobbit is indeed not only a good children's book, but a good one overall. Its narrative is constantly flowing. One of John Ronald's best gems."
5,classic,"Firstly book was mailed quickly and in excellent condition.Tolkien's classic is just as funny and entertaining as ever. My 14 year old son is reading it for the first time, and is really enjoying it. With the Hobbit movie reportedly coming out in 2011, it is a great family idea to to order it now, read it over the year, and then see the movie."
5,Riveting Classic!!!,"I have read this book so many times I could almost recite it and it gets better every time. Love it, love Tolkien, what more can I say. Talkien paint a magic fantasical picture of middle earth that only he could create. It is a masterpiece that draws you in so completely into the lives of hobbits, dwarves, elves and humans that you almost feel lonely once the book is finished. You journey with Bilbo and dwarves through all their adventures and mishaps with the occasion visit from Gandalf to take back the stolen treasure from the dragon Smaug. I highly recommend this book!"
5,As good as ever,I loveThe Hobbit--ever since my mom read it to me as a girl. I wanted to read it again before seeing the movie and decided to buy a digital copy for my Kindle since my paper copy is falling apart. I'm thoroughly enjoying this latest addition along with the clickable footnotes.
5,Waited to long to read this,This book was all I was hoping for and one of the best books I ever read I highly recommend this book to anyone that enjoys a fantastic fantasy story. Anyone on the fence about this book please allow me to give you a push in the right direction
4,Almost a 5 star,"It would have been 5 stars if I could have zoomed in on some of the illustrations. Illustrations are good, but one wants to see in more detail."
4,the Hobbit,"Heavy reading, but interesting- my son if finding it challenging and wants to watch the movie also. Glad we ordered it."
5,The best book on my shelves from looks to story,"I got it on Christmas, and it took me about a week to read it, I've read the story twice, and I still love showing off its snazzy cover and maps. The story made me feel like I was really there, and the cover made it seem like the book was from that time and age. There is not a flaw in it, and I can only say that it is a superb buy for the dedicated reader."
5,The Hobbit,"I liked it better in English than in German, which isn't astonishing as the original is in English.I like Bilbo and his being an anti-hero and I felt with the elbs when they shot down the dragon who in the end got, what all greedy, power hungry people deserve."
5,Fantastic book.,This book is certainly a classic. It should be required reading in school. A must read for every human on the face of the earth.
4,A good read.,This book was brilliant and the only reason that it didn't get five stars from me was the use of too much music for my taste. It seemed that in every chapter there was someone singing something and the song was written out. I believe I could have done without most of that.
5,Wonderful,It is a classic. What more is there to say really? Loads of action and a great escape from reality
3,The Hobbit,"Since about 1500 other people have written summaries of this book, I'll skip it. I came across this book when my brother lent me his copy along with the LOTR trilogy since he loved them and knew he had a better chance of getting me to read the books than watch the movies. This genre really isn't my thing, BUT The Hobbit is well written and a quick, easy read. I thought this was a very OK book. If nothing else, I'm glad I read it just because it is such a classic."
5,The Pre-Fantasy of Fantasies,"With the advent of Peter Jackson's coming films, I recently reread The Hobbit to refamiliarize myself with it. Surprisingly, it was much simpler than I remember, or at least its prose has a simpler, much more folksy writing style than I recalled, and was certainly breezier than the denser pre-LOTR works (the Silmarillion, and so on). Nevertheless, the book is a lovely entryway to Tolkien and his Middle Earth, offering plenty of marvelous characters and lots of adventure.All the usual suspects are here as a precursor to Lord of the Rings: elves, dwarves, goblins, trolls, wargs, enormous eagles, dragons (very interested to see what Mr. Cumberbatch does with Smaug in the film version), and of course the timeless Gollum. The book is a much smaller companion piece to each book of the later trilogy (it weighs in at around 250 pgs usually). All in all an epic tale for a lovely and mystical evening of reading."
4,If you like Harry Potter you will love this!,"This book starts out slow and boring. After I stuck out a few chapters this book I knew would be awesome. This book has great characters and story -settings. This story is about Bilbo Baggins an old hobbit who doesn't like adventure. But after he hears what the dwarves have in mind he is ready to go. They go on wild adventures and fight goblins, trolls, and giant spiders. Once they reach Lonely Mountain they find Smaug the dragon guarding what they had wanted most, the treasure. The best part of the book was when Smaug fell to his slayers feet from the black arrow piercing him. I also loved the ending because it was so funny what had happened to Bilbo's House."
5,A FAN OF ALL THINGS TOLKIEN,i am a fan of all things tolkien from the tolkien influenced black metal to anything that is written about him or anything like that. i love this book i have read it about 12 times since i have had it in 6 grade. The words he uses to describe every thing like when they are walking through mirkwood to the final bout with smaug it is all majestic imagrey and it is just great.If u like any kind of metal at all u need to check out SUMMONING it is a black metal band that is deeply influenced by tolkien books and it also creates great imagery around the lyrics and it is all just great.
5,Enjoyed reading again after so many years!,I read the book many years ago in high school and wanted to read it again before I saw the movie. It is a classic and I loved being introduced to all the characters once again.
4,Greatest book ever,This is perhaps one of the greatest books I have ever read. It's plot was great and it was just a great story with great character s.
3,"Fine, but... (may contain a slight spoiler)","I bought this book following my watching the similar named movie.The story line itself is quite interesting with lots of twists and turns and gives a good overall adventure to read. However at the end of certain chapters it refers to the ending of the next chapter, spoiling as it is the story a bit and you already know what is going to happen. Also I found the reading of the story quite tiresome. I can't really put it into words but I couldn’t read for long at a time before I had to stop for a pause.However if anyone wants to know what happens (more or less) instead of waiting for the next movies to come out… buy and read ahead.To summarise:Good:- Interesting story- Nice twists- Keeps the main characters centralBad:- Spoils the next chapter before it even begins (for ex “well you know that he found the way out, but that is for the next chapter)- Tiresome to read"
5,One book that I would recommend,"Excellent narration, epic story and it has all the elements that a reader who loves middle earth fantasies would expect! I recommend reading it."
5,Great reading of a fantastic book!,"I first fell in love with The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings in 6th grade. That love hasn't faded over the ensuing 40 years. This audiobook - and the companion for LoTR - do the original full justice. Rob Inglis is a master of voice and characterization - and he brings the book fully to life.I do wish that this were available on MP3; transferring the disks to iTunes is a bit cumbersome. But if you're looking for a fantastic listening experience, this is more than worth that minimal effort."
5,Great,I love it.It is amazing.I mean hobbits in hundreds or thousands could never match to Bilbo Baggins bravest achievement in the book.
5,The hobbit,It was a wonderful book and would recommend it for everyone to read!any age or gender would fall into the story and become a character themselves.
4,The Hobbit,"This book was an exiting adventure, but confusing at times. The beginning might not get you interested into it, but I am positive that if you keep reading it, you would soon love it!"
4,Awesome book!,"The Hobbit is inspirational, seeing Mr. Baggins transform from a non-adventurous fellow to a very confident risk-taker! We have the audible dramatized abridged version, which was ok. My son prefers the unabridged version."
3,A bit too old style for my taste,"A bit too old style for my taste. That is all I have to say and nothing more, I neither liked nor hated it."
3,Fair but not very good used,"The spine of this book was no good it was presented as very good used condition, with the spine in that condition I disagree it should have been listed at a lower quality"
5,Great,This is a great book and I loved it. Can't wait to read Lord of the Rings!So amazingly awesome. J.R.R. is beast.
5,Gud book!,Dis book is rlly gud! I reely liek the part were tey shut the draggon!! If u like books get dis
3,I like the movie better,An OK read but the movie has a much more developed story line. Surprising when a movie trumps a book!
5,"Wonderful, sweeping, entertaining",The Hobbit is pure fun and one of the most entertaining books you'll ever read. Read this before Lord of the Rings. Enjoy!
4,cute and fun,"Unlike its admittedly horrible sequels, I liked this book a lot. It was light and funny, and flavoured with a wonderfully dry and ironic style of narration. Unlike LOTR, which was overstuffed with useless information, The Hobbit never stops being exciting. This is the sort of thing Tolkien should have stuck with."
3,To Much Detail.,"This book dragged on and on going from one scene to the next in a boring and tedious manner. The writing wasnt great and the main charactor angeredme ! Bilbo just sort of wanders around during the whole book. All and all highly over rated , very tedious, and not a great book."
2,Hobbits are just another type of Elf,"I would strongly recommend this book to those who play ""Dungeons and Dragons."" I honestly don't care which of the 5000 races of little people someone belongs to. This book had a few highly actioned and interresting parts in the book, but overall this book is dull, and Bilbo the main charachter complained most of the time.For instance, there was often a large gap between action scenes. I was really looking up to the death of Smaug, a charachter who's ego was expanded into godlike preportions, died a pitiful death, with hardly any contact with the adventuring gang. And finally, my favorite charachter(Gandalf)left prematurely."
1,accidently purchased,"I purchased by mistake, did not read but I'm sure it is a good read and may purchase in the future."
3,J. R. Tolkien World,A Prequel to Lord of The Rings and a tale of the how the Baggins family became famous. A better understanding of how Gandolf became invovled with the Hobbits.
5,Love it!,Everything I ordered was safely packaged and the item I ordered was in perfect condition! I wish other companies would care this much about their customers; THANK YOU!
5,THE HOBBIT,"Filled with action and the fun of dwarves, elves, goblins, the hobbit Bilbo, Gandalf the grey bearded wizard, and the Dragon !!"
2,Little Fellows,"I would recommend this book to kids, Elementary kids for the most part because it might be too childish for grown ups, yet to hard to understand for someone whos just too young. I found this book to be interesting; it kept me reading it and turning the pages. I thought the ending could have been alittle better because it was just too simple for the complexity of the book. Smog seemed to be a big force with a huge wrath but he was killed easily do to the lack of diamonds over the one part of his body that is the most vulnerable, his heart. I think there should have been a big war lasting days, carrying the drama out longer. This book was a bit slow in the middle and beginning but picked up at latter until the disappointing end. Overall it wasn't that bad of a book to read for school but I personally like something a little more realistic."
2,this this book is not too good,this book is pretty hard to follow and has to many characters doing to many things at once. i suggest you dont read this book unless your a real hardcore novel reader. but most of all this book is very boring. dwarves and hobbits dont really inspire anybody anyway.
1,not interesting at all,"i wish if i just could get my money back, the book is not interesting and boring !!!hate it"
2,The Hobbit- An Enchanting Beginning to an Epic Series,"The Hobbit is the introductory novel to the epic fantasy, The Lord of the Rings. This book is about an imaginary creature called a hobbit, who goes on a journey through the imaginary country of Middle Earth with a group of dwarves. Bilbo, the hobbit, and his company of dwarves are on their way to steal back their long forgotten treasure that is guarded by a hideous dragon. This story tells of the hardships they encounter on their journey and the changes that each character, especially Bilbo, goes through. this book is wonderful because it ties in the world of fantasy with real life. The characters go through the same emotional and sometimes physical struggles that we find ourselves going through. The Hobbit is a great book that everybody can relate to in one way or another. If you are looking for an exciting and thrilling escape from reality, reading The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings trilogy is the best way to do just that."
3,Mrs.,"This is a good book, the only complaint i have of it is also its compliment. I be came sometimes board and eager to get past the extreme descriptions. Especially when I couldn't wait to find out what would happen next."
4,Loved it,"I am a fan of LOTR so I might be biased, but I liked the story a lot. Loved that you get to see more of the story of dwarves and of course Bilbo."
5,Money saver,I've used this product for a few weeks now. No issues. Much better than paying $40.00 for replacement thru Sears!
5,Intense almond flavor,"Very good for baking. A little goes a long way. Do not get on skin, so intense it burns. There is no harm done."
1,Unacceptable change of theme,"Commodore Junk George Manville FennHave read almost a dozen of George Manville Fenn's novels. All were quite good if not excellent. I would confidently recommend every one - except this one. There is a situation with the main character which seems rather unbelievable, but I suppose it could happen. The real problem is that the theme (justifiable anger with strong leanings towards revenge), which is stated early on and confirmed, off and on, throughout of the novel, is then completely reversed, with no explanation for such a drastic and unrealistic alteration. After that, for me, the plot crumbles to gross nonsense.Sorry Mr Fenn, you truly let me down this time. Without that totally illogical twist I would have rated this book, as with most of your others, a 5 star"
3,ordered too soon,Was told by online puppy seller that I would need this product when I received my new puppy. My vet says it is mostly sugar and my dog does not need this product. So I regret my purchase. I also purchased the version for older dogs based on the seller's recommendation. Shame on me.
3,worth a try,"I have read some of the reviews on this, and wanted to try it. I think its good for my little guy. If its just basically sugar and oil, it can't hurt him, and I would rather have a healthy pup that not. Worth a try."
5,Good for your puppy!,I got this for my dog when she was smaller and she loved it. It smells greatand anything she likes I like. Great for the prize.
1,Wrong brand,Thought I would give this brand a try but it does not work at all. Turns drippy. The puppies and dogs hate it!
1,Instead,mix peanut butter with a little olive and sunflower oil and a little honey and a quality doggie vitamin supplement.
1,waste of money,"Bought this item for one of our rescue puppies, but she refused to eat the nutri-cal. It smells horrible and looks really gross has a thick texture, but is VERY greasy (if not mixed well all you get out of the tube is oil). Now this pup has NEVER refused food, so I tried to hide it in cheese but she still refused it.putting a small gob on my finger I put in directly on her tongue hoping she'd change her mind, and she still managed to spit the gob out (along with a whole lot of drool!)"
3,It works but eehhhhh......read below,I had a little Italian Greyhound puppy that came to me SKIN AND BONESIt was sad I quickly knew I needed some extra cals and some skin care due to dry skin again another product of not being feed correctly!Well this stuff does WORK dont get me wrong it works BUT after shipping your looking at 15 bucks a bottleWhile this isnt BAD by anymeans I can go to PetSmart and get a Calorie Supplement in a tube for 7 dollars AND is had more cals and a few more vitaminsCheck around before paying shipping!
3,Backpack,"This looked like a nice sturdy back pack for my son. He has CF and is smaller than most kids so he has a real hard time carrying all the books he has in school so I thought this rolling back pack would be great. It has been great, he loves it but he's only had it for 2 weeks and already has worn holes in the bottom, I think it's his fault for trying to roll it the wrong way but...there are holes on both sides already."
5,Great book for true baseball fans,"I thought this book was intellegent and I enjoyed reading how La Russa deals with being a manager, he talked about the loss of Darryl Kile. It shows TLR is a real sensitive guy and loving person to his team and family and he gets a long really well with the owner, a respectful guy, and a true hero."
2,The Bad Outweighs the Good,"This could have been such a wonderful book. The prose was elegant, the story was intense and everything came together well.Except for the fact Buzz Bissinger has a vendetta against sabermetrics and sabermetricians. The attacks on the book ""Moneyball"" and the flipant remarks attacking others (like me) who love the game was sickening.I would avoid this book and look elsewhere for that ""summer classic."""
5,Buzz is the Man,This depiction of baseball was very interesting & insightful. Bissinger again scores very high marks after his success with Friday Night Lights. I am not a huge baseball fan but do enjoy well written provocative literature. I will wait anxiously for Buzz's next offering.
1,Anti Sabermetric garbage,"I love Tony LaRussa, as I'm an A's fan. However, Bissinger has an agenda with this book. He wants it to be the anti Moneyball. He doesn't believe in the philisophy of using statistics to judge performance and make decisions. He has said this, and attacked Michael Lewis' Moneyball without offering any kind of decent rebuttal. He goes on some rant that humans aren't machines and that the human element is important. Yes, every person is different ""Buzz,"" and statistics are just a way of quantifying those differences. 4 postseason appearances for the A's and a world series title for the Red Sox bear out the success of sabermetrics. It's here to say, despite the fact that stubborn baseball people hate it because it destroys so much of their outmoded and inefficient ideas and strategies."
3,Just Does Not Deliver,"I was really lookinig forward to reading this book. To me, Tony LaRussa is one of the best in-game managers in baseball and this book promised to give us an inside look at his mindset and strategies throughout a 3 game series with the Cubs. Overall? Not bad and, especially early on, I was enjoying the book and the intimacy of ""seeing"" LaRussa's thought process in various situations. It simply didn't last throughout, or it seemed to bog down or become repetitive. I enjoyed the book as a whole, but the latter third of it became slow, almost tedious at times."
3,Just Passable,The movie was just barely OK. It was hard to pay attention to it. Elvira's antics were more enjoyable than the movie.
1,AWFUL movie! Not even Elvira can save this turkey.,"I am amazed anyone could say this is a good movie. The plot is completely ridiculous and all over the place. Dracula spends half the movie trying to bring his daughter back to life, then in the space of two seconds he inexplicably changes his mind and dumps her in the canal. The first forty minutes seemed like a good setup, but the rest is just ridiculous. Elvira is usually good for a laugh, but this is one movie even she can't make worth suffering through.The dubbing is indeed as bad as everyone says--a fight scene in which no one even remotely connects fist to flesh is particularly hilarious. The guys swing at the air while one moans for no reason. It's like an Ed Wood film in Spanish. In fact, this Drac bears some resemblance to the Lugosi stand-in in PLAN 9.Not even cheesy fun. Just boring. But yeah, for the guys, there are some topless women. And the single creative touch is what the mirror shows when Karen hits the sheets with Drac."
3,Beautiful Babes With Huge... Fangs!...,"Paul Naschy stars as the eeevil title character in COUNT DRACULA'S GREAT LOVE. He lives high in the mountains, in his crumbling, castle of solitude. Uh-oh, Drac's serenity is interrupted when a carriage full of young lasses arrives. Of course, it's not long before the gals have a nice, naked dip in the castle pool. Then, one of the Count's vampire buddies bites the lone male of the group, and a blood-sucking plague begins! Much nudity ensues, as The Prince of Darkness attempts to resurrect his daughter (he keeps her in the basement). The rest is a muddled mess that makes little sense. Still, there's something about this movie that I like..."
1,Good film - Atrocious DVD... Don't buy,"The movie is Ok, I'm not writing this to review the actual film but the DVD itself. The quality is terrible, especially for the price. You get a very, very bad transfer with awful colors and great loss of detail, but the biggest problem is that the thing seems to have been taken from a bootleg, filmed in an actual movie theater, as the screen is not complete! No matter what you do, you will never see the whole screen, and never is it more evident than in the credits where some words are cut. In the movie, some scenes just lack coherence because of this. For example, when Naschy first appears after opening the door of his Sanatorium to his visitors, we CAN'T SEE HIM because the screen is cut!!!Terrible DVD. Wait for a decent release to buy this movie, which deserves the kind of treatment DEIMOS has given to Naschy's Werewolf films...."
4,Great cricket bat for tennis ball play....,"We used to play with this bat using tennis ball and had no problem. It works great. The package came with 2 tennis balls (which are too good), we enjoyed playing using them in a basket ball court and had no problem. Dont know about hard ball though.It also came with a very small cute bat (miniature of the real one). You may give that one to kids to play indoor...sweet.Not too tall so may not be great enough for tall people..."
3,Nice Little Noir,"PICKUP ON SOUTH STREET---(1953)Richard Widmark,Jean Peters, Thelma Ritter, Richard Kiley.I had not seen this film prior to ordering it but had seen/heard many references to it in discussions of film noir. Being a great fan of Widmark, I decided to add it to my collection. I found it to be a pretty good little film---nothing special, but enjoyable. Widmark plays yet another ""low-life"" that lives by his own ""code"". Thelma Ritter is especially good as the world-weary ""snitch"" who also has her own set of rules to live by. The film was made at the height of the ""Red Scare"" period and the obsession with, ""the Commies"", is somewhat dated---even comical, at times. Anyway, as I noted, not a great film, but, IMO, worth watching."
3,More Anti-Commie than Noir,"SPOILERS: As a noir, the movie is a little disappointing. It has an agenda to satisfy a McCarthyite anti-communist litmus test above the demands of narrative. The main communist character, for example, is too nervous cowardly to meet with Widmark in the first reel and then shifts into homicidal mania to kill the sick, older lady in her bed. It looks good, though, and Widmark is great the role. Great dialog, too."
1,Waste of a great premise,"If you're a big fan of film noir you might enjoy the camera angles, picture and sound. Personally I was disappointed in the story.I heard a review and thought it sounded like a great idea for a story. A guy on a train steals a woman's purse on a subway, not knowing that she's carrying microfilm which she's supposed to deliver to a Russian spy. Suddenly, this thief has the cops and the Russians looking for him.It sounded like a great idea, but the story was a huge disappointment to me. The characters were not very believable. For example, the woman who has her purse stolen, tracks down the thief and tries to get the film back. He punches her in the face and she falls in love with him.To me the story was very weak, which spoiled the movie. If you're interested in the movie for the technical stuff, you might enjoy it. Personally, I didn't find it very entertaining or believable."
5,Brutal Little Known Noir Masterpiece!,"This little known gem is a knockout sleeper. Tough, brutal, and effective noir. Fuller pulps it up as he tells us the story of a down on his luck pickpocket who hits it big when he steals a topsecret microfilm that's worth a look to the commies. But the film's plot isn't its strong point. The quiet scenes between Jean Peters and Richard Widmark are unbearably sexy. The scene where he knocks her out and then wakes her up by spilling cold beer on her is one of the defining moments in noir history. Thelma Ritter delivers a devastating performance as the tough Moe, a weary kindhearted informer who `has to make a living somehow', a heartbreaking performance. Also the last scenes where Widmark beats the hell out of Peters's weasely commie boyfriend is just about as violent as you could get back then. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film an 8!"
1,missed opportunity,"Made during the height of the cold war hysteria,this film gets sidetracked by mindless red baiting.It also descends into cheesy melodrama on a couple ofoccasions marring the pacing of the movie. It's toobad but pickup doesn't live up to its reputation astop notch noir."
5,"SAMUEL FULLER, OPUS 6","***** 1953. Written and directed by Samuel Fuller. One nomination for the Academy awards (Thelma Ritter). A pickpocket steals a microfilm without knowing it. Cops, F.B.I. and communists are soon after him. Criterion released a perfect copy of this movie that should be in any movie lover's library. Two rare interviews of Samuel Fuller complete this DVD. Masterpiece."
5,Surprisingly good,"I am a long time fan of Richard Widmark for his acting skill and Jean Peters for her beauty. However, I have mixed feelings about film noir movies -- some are quite good but others are just depressing. Pickup on South Street is a good film noir movie. But, as a fan of both Widmark and Peters, their presence added to my enjoyment of this film which I consider to be one of my favorites."
4,"Au Revoir, Richard...thanks for this great one among many!","Great job...great actor...he will be missed! Seeing this one, plus Kiss of Death, and then The Bedford Incident will give you a good overview of R.W.'s talent and his contribution to acting over the years."
3,Good eye area cleaner,"This is a good product to soften eye area discharge, but it doesn't do much to remove tear stains on my white poodle. Still, I like this product because it does make it easier to clean the eye areas. I do not want products like Angel Eyes that use various chemicals that are fed to the dog to take care of eye stains. So, though not perfect, this is a pretty good help in keeping the eye areas clean."
4,Good as a Limnology Primer,"This is an excellent general reference text. Can not say enough about the excellent content of this text. But it is need of an edition update with information for lake mapping and restoration. Dr. C.L. Nelson of St. Cloud State University, St. Cloud, MN has an excellent small text on physical limnology for the mapping aspect. This book does do an excellent job on the biological aspects of limnological work."
2,Just one thought,"With dozens of relationship self-help books on the market: ""Why Men Love Bitches"", ""Why Women Love Jerks""... etc, it all boils down to one simple idea.Nice girls who are too compliant are boring... that's why men love bitches. Nice guys who do all the ""right"" things are boring... that's why women love jerks.All further analysis and arguments about self-respect, being a doormat, and playing games are unnecessary. Maybe someone should write a book on how not to be boring..."
3,true but too repetitive,"It's very true that most men like bitches better. i think it also works the other way around. If a man is too needy, a woman gets turned off. However, the book repeats this concept over and over again - it is enough to skim through parts of the book to get the key points. The author provides 100 rules/tips but a lot of them are on the same thing."
4,Fascinating!,"Sherry Argov has really made women sit up and take notice. Her compelling insight into so many tough questions has generated a lot of talk, I'm sure, throughout and about; wherever women gather. I also enjoy some of the hilarious real life scenarios she demonstrates. This is a book for women who've never been able to stand up for themselves where men are concerned and need to know who they really are. Sherry Argov will help you out with that with no problem.JT Briggsauthor of ""Mama Said There'd Be Dates Like This"""
5,Why men love bitches?,I LOVE THIS BOOK! N I WILL SHARED IT WITH EVERY NICE GIRL I KNOW... IS A SELF IMPROVEMENT BOOK IT HELPS UNDERSTAND MEN AND HOW TO COMMUNICATE EFFICIENTLY. GREAT GREAT BOOK!! DON'T JUDGE A BOOK BY ITS COVER!! THERE SHOULD BE A FEMALE VERSION
3,"Ok book, needs improvement","This book is okay, and is helpful to see when women give too much of themselves to please a man, on that I recommend it.Where the book needs improvement, IMHO, is that I really didn't learn what to do beyond the games like playing ""dumb as a fox"" I found this to be more disempowering than helpful.I don't want to play dumb anymore, or play games, and I really don't think a man deserves this from any woman."
4,The empowerment part is good,"I'm a guy, and I read this book 5 times. I wholeheartedly agree with the parts where the author encourages women to be strong, be proud, have a job, not be a nag, respect herself and not let herself be stepped on. The parts I don't agree with are where Sherry seems to think that men don't read her book, men are totally clueless, stupid, emotional, sports playing, car loving beer guzzlers. The ""Dumb like a Fox"" chapter where Sherry suggests that a woman play dumb and suck up to a guy's ego to manipulate a guy is an insult to any intelligent woman. The more highly evolved man does read her book, and more than once too!So, if you ladies want to try to manipulate us, know that we too read these books and can counter your schemes. So, if you still want to try to manipulate us, come on down, AND BRING IT ON!!!!!"
4,Saved Me From The Hell Of Failed Relationships,"When I picked up this book, I had been suffering the aftermath of three failed relationships in a row. I started reading it on my way home and finished it within 2 days! It is astonishingly honest and straight to the point and made me see my romantic history in a new light.Every woman who has ever had problems with men should buy this book and recommend it to her girlfriends. I am marrried now and my book is lovingly handed over to my best friend- she needs it really bad!!!You could say that you already know men and that nothing you can read or hear will add up to your knowledge--- Just like I used to say, but trust me, this book is going to change your lovelife once and for all!!Highly recommended."
2,The Antidote to Men are from Mars...,"This book should come with a coupon for Hagen Daas, because you're going to end up on the sofa eating comfort food and wondering what went wrong. I read this book. I laughed in all the right places, but then I made a terrible mistake. I took Sherry Argov's advice seriously. My marriage was good, but this book made me think I was getting shortchanged. So I took the leap and took control. Now I'm in marriage counseling and wondering if I'm going to be able to hang onto my husband. I did get one thing right, though. After eleven years of wonderful marriage, I managed to get my husband to call me a bitch. I'm trying to get him to believe that I'm in a midlife crisis. Because I can't bring myself to say that I destroyed a great relationship because of something that sounded good in a book."
4,To Thine Own Self Be True,"I love love love this book. The writing style was witty and sharp and I found myself thinking many times as I was reading ""...this is sooooo true"". Some areas I did not quite agree with but I think the underlying message which women should take away is to thine own self be true. Don't cut off your nose to make some man happy...respect yourself first and all other things will follow."
5,Why Men Love Bitches,"A fantatic book for every woman, especially those that give too much in relationships and get little in return. A must read before thinking of dating for the first time or last time. I will keep the book and read it again."
5,Great Advice,I think most of what is said in this book is good solid advice. Don't let someone walk all over you in a relationship and keep your own life in tact. Don't be rude or mean but don't put up with bad treatment either! There is a balance to everything. The author is sassy and to the point. I reread it whenever I need a reminder. It works too. Just apply it to your own situation so that it works best for you. I think all women should read this book.
1,Great Book For Men to Read As Well,"I read this book to learn what women think about men and what they think in general about relationships. As an avid student of the Art of War, I think this is a most read for all men that are willing to prepare themselves fully in how to recognize the tactics that women slavishly follow or how to mimic the kinds of men they are looking for. Yes, this is deception, however it is exactly this kind of strategem that the author of this book, Sherry Argov, is promoting. Men used to work hard at guessing what was behind women's motives. Now the task is easy, as women are writing more and more books and in the process, revealing more and more in the process about themselves."
3,Common sense,"This book was okay. Most of it is basic common sense. Also, I have a problem with how non-feminist some parts are but all in all it had a few good points."
2,Not so good advice,"I read this book last summer and used it with the man I was dating, and he almost dumped me!There are some good points in here, about not compromising your value, and being confident in yourself.But then the parts about not showing emotion and showing your true self is just bad advice. Showing your emotions sometimes shows authenticity.To be combative, manipulative and treat a relationship like a game of chess is selfish and unloving. I believe these tactics work great on men with low self esteem, but not on confident, successful, quality men.Read at your own risk!"
1,Very shallow book,"I bought this book out of curiosity after reading all its favorable reviews, and unfortunately, I find it very disappointing. I think Agrove tried to write a manual for women to train a man. Relationships are much more complex than the book suggests, and I don't believe that men should be trained like pets by using the carrot and stick method. I find this book very shallow, simplistic, and targeted to apply to the masses. Also, I don't like the title of the book. The author could call ""bitches"" ""strong women"" instead. Both ""bitch"" and ""doormat"" seem to be derogatory to women, and men are depicted as silly puppies that can be easily manipulated by the ""stick and carrot"" method. I do not recommend this book."
3,Good Read,"The book was very insightful. Learned some things that I can do better, and the things that I was already doing well. I think that the author should acknowledge that some of the basic needs/wants speak to the cultural/ethnic background as well because I couldnt relate to everything she was talking about since they were not my experiences..."
5,Have Confidence! and laugh!,"This book is great for anyone who needs to be reminded the importance of confidence. It illustrates how to have the right balance of independence/""neediness"" (as in will you please kill that bug) in a relationship and in life. It will help you understand guys' thinking and it will make you laugh out loud!"
2,Midwest Values,"Is it my imagination or are most of the glowing reviews that seem to love this book and its approach to men and men/women relationships from the East and West coasts?Don't seem to have this problem with women---and their men---in the Heartland of America. Two kids and thirty-one years later, I'm still in love with the same hard ass, tough, determined woman I married long ago. We, however, don't play games with each other.Quit playing games and maybe one day you can say the same thing too."
1,Seriously ladies?!,"I'm sorry but this book is garbage. I could only get through the first 3 chapters & it just felt mind-numbing. We need a woman who's a Neil Strauss type to write a book lol. I learned more from The Game, being a woman, than anything from my short read of this book."
5,A Must Read For Every Female No Matter Her Age,"Fantastic book. I wish I had read this when I was a teenager. Shoot, I wish my parents had read it to me as a bedtime story, it's that important. :-)"
1,I don't like it,"As a man, I bought this book to help me try to understand how women think. This book scared me. The author seems to have a narrow idea of what men are. I found it sexist and almost racist. Women that read and follow the guidelines of this book will only find men that the author describes. Selfish and lazy. I was going to give this book to Goodwill, but I think that I will burn it instead."
1,This is the problem with American Women,"If you think this is how a woman should act in a relationship, you have another thing coming. Athough I suggest to you that we neither want a meek woman but someone inbetween who can hold her own and still be a lady.Such a gross misrepresentation what a man wants..ugh."
1,only a stereotypical delusional woman....,"...could write an entire book about something she is apparently clueless about, and keep a straight face.fwiw, ladies, i have dropped plenty of women who act like the author of this book suggests. i kept the one who acted the opposite way of everything this book suggests."
1,Very poor,One of the worst books that I purchased in amazon. It may be useful just for young teenage girls not for the adults.
3,"Worth reading, with a few caveats","This book tries to address a subject we can all relate to: why men seem to take nice girls for granted. The author's basic point is correct in principle, that no man respects a doormat, i.e. a woman who puts her man's needs before her own. However, her solution is to dispense some dumb, game-playing advice. And the book basically says the same thing over and over. The author does not seem to know the difference between having self-respect, and playing games to create the APPEARANCE of self-respect. Most men can tell the difference eventually.Despite these criticisms, I thought the book was funny and gutsy. And although the author uses the word ""bitch,"" she makes it clear that she is not advocating rude or bitchy behavior of any kind. The term is for fun and to sell books. This is a fun read, but there are better books on how to deal with men."
5,So True Til It Hurt,"After reading this book, I realized just how many mistakes I have made in my previous relationships. With occasional sobs/tears and laughter, I had to agree with every rule in the book. Who would have thought that a man wouldn't want a woman to spoil them? I never thought that a man would see being nic as a sign of weakness, but it is so TRUE!!! Every man I have dealt with in past relationships have been spoiled by me but they always walk away. The last guy got a motorcycle and all expense paid trip to FL out of the deal AFTER the break-up and his ""we can see other people"" just because I wanted to be ""NICE""! How crazy is that. I still think he sits around with his friends and laugh at me. If only I had this book in the beginning of the relationship, this would be so different now. A must read for every women. Men will USE you if you let them. Demand respect and you will get it. Never be a doormat again!"
5,Beth,"This book is fabulous. I am a 25 year old female who has always been ""the nice girl."" It's not as if I haven't had relationships. Yet, even in those relationships, I always felt like a ""doormat."" My friends and I always wondered why the guys we didn't like kept coming around. We would sit in the car and read this book aloud to each other. This book is liberating, and I recommend it to any woman looking to take control of herself and her love life."
2,Advocates game playing & manipulation,"I wanted to like this book. Many women, including myself, could benefit from having more of a backbone when it comes to romantic relationships. In that sense, this book is a step in the right direction. Unfortunately, the book's message is muddied by its endorsement of game playing and manipulation. The author tells you many times she's not telling you to play games but the reality is that's what her advice boils down to. So . . take away the importance of being strong and being yourself. But unless you want inauthentic relationships based on manipulation and games, save your money."
5,Very helpful for all the single ladies!,"I would recommend this book to any single gal out there. I received the book about a month ago and have been following the tips and suggestions that come with it. Hands down, they work. I have received much more attention from men (not necessarily quality men) and the number of my dates have doubled. This is a great guide and I highly recommend it.... now my next purchase is Why Men Marry Bitches."
5,GREAT book,"This book is not about being a ""bitch"" but rather about not settling for less then you deserve. It is about being comfortable getting what you want and need in a relationship. The book is a must read for any female. I'm 39 and read it; then I gave it to my 16 year old to read. It is as good as He's Just Not That Into You and equally as powerful."
4,"Similiar to ""The Rules""","Has a few different ideas in it. Some of it, like the Rules is over the top but if you follow this or The Rules you will only keep men that are truly interested in you and why bother with the rest anyway?A male friend of mine read it and says it's true!"
5,Very good Book !,"I'm a man and I'm reading selections from this book to my wife , I love the changes I'm seeing in her as she becomes more grown up less of a doormat . . . duh. . . more bitchy ."
2,Everyone dances to their own tune,"I have to say that this book was very well-written, with some humorous touches. I don't agree however, that anyone should have to change their complete frame of mind and actions, just to find a meaningful relationship. I cannot take all this advice without a grain of salt, and I believe I'll just continue to be the nice me."
5,Great book!,"I got this book in great condition and before the expected date of arrival. the book itself is a great read, would def recommend to other ladies."
5,"Hilarious, and full of good advice!","Because I loved the title, I ordered this book from Amazon. Full of good advice for the overly compliant woman, this book is also written to bring out the humor of remedies to several aspects of dominant male-submissive female relationships."
3,Getting a handle on dating,"I found the book to be a bit tongue-in-cheek. It comes off like a universal recipe for women succeeding in relationships, but it is clearly meant for the 20 to 30-somethings. Older women are really not included, perhaps because it is expected that older women already know what's in this book, or maybe they are considered off the ""market"" and undatable beyond relationships with men. It was humorous in spots, a bit authoritative in others. It was a good summer read.Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship"
2,great title,"It's all in the title. The rest is washed out, generic info- or more like an outline of the book the author planned to write.Some good tips, and lots of bad ones, and no depth or detail in explanations.I could have written a more entertaining & thought-provoking version while on the toilet."
4,Excellent Book,"I finished the first 2 chapters and they're excellent. I'm sure when I'm finished it's going to be a 5 star book. This book sends the message that it's not about playing games to get a man to stay with you or to marry you, it's about respecting yourself as a woman and expecting to receive nothing but the best. When you love yourself, you treat yourself well. This in turn will attract a man who will respect you and truly wants to be with you. Men do test the waters very often to see what they can get for less. Women need to be aware of this!!"
5,"A ""Must Read"" for anyone seeking an equitable relationship.","Read this book for ""self help"" advice, read this book for a truly unique insight on dating, read it for fun, just read this book. I guarantee you won't be able to put it down."
1,Did Not Work!!,"I acted like a super bitch -- and it didn't help! None of the tools designed to shift the parameters of a relationship provided in this book did much for me. Perhaps this book is aimed towards women interested in a different type of men, because I am sorry to say that the man I was dating saw through the tricks being pulled. After a number of dates, our relationship began falling apart as I was getting more bitchy and manipulative, as Sherry's book suggests. At first, the guy fell for it and was upset that I seemed to be losing interest in him. I did not want to see him heart-broken, but continued following the advice given as I wanted to maintain the relationship. But it didn't take long for him to catch on to what was actually happening. He said that my wonderful aura had been lost and said (really) that I was acting like a disgusting bitch. I hate this book!"
1,Truly dreadful,"If you want to end up as a lonely bitter eternal single this is the manual to follow. Women would be outraged if they found a book like this advising men to act like complete creeps towards them.If you want a quality partner in your life for more than a one night stand, you have to treat them with respect.Don't waste your money on this pathetic book for the sad Sex & the City spinstresses."
3,Waiting to read the entire book...,"As a relationship coach and therapist, I am always interested in learning more about the variety of opinions and ideas out there. I haven't read the book in it's entirety yet, so I will reserve final comment till then. I am not sure if the author's ideas apply to same sex relationships as that is my focus."
3,funny book that doesn't reflect reality,"I enjoyed this book, funny, some good advice, but in general, I am a ""bitch"", always have been- and the men she interviewed must all be liars. I am definitely smarter and ballsier than most of the men I meet ""out there"" and I seem to lose out to the doormats. Men say they want a challenge but they really go for someone they are confident in knowing they are smarter than and are the leader in all aspects of the relationship. Sure, miserable married men sing my praises all day long, but it gets me exactly nowhere.So, the book in theory is worthy of your time, but it's not the reality of the caveman brain."
5,Great Stuff!!,Why didn't I have this book a year ago when I did all the wrong things with some nice guys?
3,Worth reading but...,"it reminded me a little too much of The Rules. I know that men like a challenge (just like women like a challenge too). But there's something to be said for being yourself and doing what comes naturally, and not playing games--or you might attract someone who isn't right for the real you. That said, while I wouldn't take this book as gospel, it's definitely worth reading and thinking about."
5,Very helpful,Very helpful product but you need to study it deeply and not just once to get the results. I highly recommend the book.
3,Financial Neediness??!!,"Overall this book gave good advice, some I needed, some I knew and just didn't use correctly. I was happy with the purchase until she had the audacity to imply that a lack of general middle-class wealth implies neediness. Being disabled and unable to work, I live on a tight budget while on disability. I sell my paintings to supplement my income. However, I can by no means fly to Europe or take a trip to the Bahamas. Lack of monetary wealth does not mean lack of dignity or neediness!! If someone is going to judge me on lack of monetary wealth and a disability, then they can move on. I would advise her to watch herself the next time she shoots her mouth off. Things like that are easy to say when you make what she makes."
3,It was ok,"Some things she says are really helpful, but somethings just make the man want to stop the chase (games) and give up. (And if you're the nuturing type [Cancer] these methods wont work for you anyways) So this book can work on some guys but not all. 50/50 chase of results. Just be yourself, and the right guy should come along"
3,Glad I read it,"Regardless of what some negative reviews (and rants) say, this book is helpful to some. Of course, you should read it with a grain of salt and realize that not everyone is perfect ALL of the time, not even this author. Some advice is simply silly, some incredibly helpful. It depends on how you were raised and what type of role model your mother was. Sorry, but not all of us had the luxury of having emotionally healthy and culturally ""up-to-date"" moms to guide us. So no, this material is not ""common sense"".For those of you who are learning how to be a better and stronger woman, I do recommend this book. However, do not take all of the advice literally and try to practice it like a manual. You will fail miserably. I also recommend ""Stop Being the String Along"" by Barbara Rose. It's a quick read and VERY to the point. Good luck!"
