4,One Tough Glue,"Pros:-Really tough glue-More flexible than super glue-Waterproof-Works on many surfaces, metals, wood, ceramics, some plastics, etc. Best for wood applications.Cons:-It expands, drips and produce tiny bubbles during the drying process. This is my biggest gripe. Definitely not for repairing your Lladros or others applications that require hairline precision.-Glue is not clear but yellow. Very noticeable, not good if you really want a clean finish.-Make sure you really clean the tip of the bottle or it will be hard to open and use it the next time"
5,Works just fine for me,Well if know how to manage this glue then does miraclesotherwise you gonna have trouble mainly because expandstoo much but in some situations that is not that bad... right?
5,GOOD S***,"The name says it all I used it for plastic, clothing and around the house items. It's good stuff. Just got to learn not to apply too much and not too little."
2,Music good; quality BAD,"If you are like me, you buy a soundtrack because the music really stood out in the movie, and, usually, you enjoyed the movie, so the music brings back a little of that good memory. John Sayles used the music in his movie as a transition between scenes and it was very effective. The traditional music is excellent. The reason for my 2 star review is the fact that the production quality on the CD is extremely bad. Granted, most of the songs were probably somewhat obscure and the original media may not have been top quality to begin with, but from the first song you really hear a hiss in your speaker like you are playing a tape recorded to another tape. This CD really needed some digital enhancement. Don't get me wrong, the music is excellent, but if you are one of those people who buys a CD for the reason that it is supposed to sound better than a tape, then, in this case, you would be just as well off purchasing the cassette and saving a few dollars."
1,i don't get it,"i got the cd expecting something truly out of the ordinary. instead i got very bland music. i'm fairly open minded and have wide musical tastes, but this was pure garbage (no offense). as a matter of fact i tossed the cd in the garbage at work...."
4,Another facet of Brasil,"First heard these guys while doing some work this past summer in Fortaleza, then I heard them in Manaus and then in Vitoria.....They were following me. This music is perfect for sitting in your back yard, talking with a nice girl, making some barbeque."
5,I love this vacuum,"I've only had it for a week, but I love it already. I have a small house and a bunch of kids (plus one cat) the stuff this vacuum pulled out of the carpet was amazing. I thought I kept a farely clean house already and as my old Hoover was begining to fail, (it stopped sucking on one side so I'd have to go round in circles) I bought this hoping it would do a better job.Great value for the money, no bags to empty, much quieter than any vacuum I've ever owned, lighweight compared to my old vacuum and washable filters (all but one)I did have to empty the cup after each room as my carpets were so full of dust and dirt (who knew?) I usually vacuum daily and as the week has gone by the cup has needed emptying less often each day, so I must be getting cleaner?"
1,Short lifetime,"When I first bought this item, the suction was great but it lasted only one or two months. Then it started to blow dust back on the floor. It was a gift so I didn't have the receipt. I couldn't give it back. AVOID!"
5,Great and inexpensive vacuum,"I recently relocated from a house with Central Vac - needing a vacuum quickly that would pick up cat hair and bird dander (I have a cockatoo), I opted for the Bissell 2576 CleanView II Plus Upright. I paid $79 here on Amazon w/ no shipping charges. The vacuum is a gem! I was afraid it would not do a good job, but it is awesome. I would recommend this vacuum to all. It's also easy to clean and to assemble."
4,Clean the filter after a month.,"In response to all of you customers who commented that the vacuum stopped working well after one month, clean the filters!! The same thing happened to me and after cleaning the filters, it worked like new again. There are two filters, one above the dirt cup and one below it that build up dust gunk. My only complaint for this vacuum is that cleaning these filters every month can be a pain."
2,Burned my carpet,"I have had this vacuum for a month now. Last week I had the wand attachment hooked up and I was vacuuming a shelf. It didn't take long, but the motor got hot and the vacuum tipped slightly back burning a hole in my new carpet. The irony is thick. Be wary of the hot motor. Other than that the vacuum works well so far."
2,Short Lived,"This was a great vacuum....for about 4 months. After that, it started making a wheezing sound and now if I don't clean it after every other use, the hoses get clogged. Judging from some of the other comments, this vacuum has major design flaws. Save your money and purchase another vacuum."
3,"Great at first, died in less than a year","I was thrilled with this vacuum at first. It was inexpensive, but did a bang-up job even in my heavily-trafficked house. After about 10 months, the hose lost its suction. Cleaning the filters helped temporarily, but I noticed that the dirt cup wasn't filling, so where's the dirt going? The bissell people couldn't help me on the phone and for an $80 piece of equipment, it's not worth taking it in to be fixed.Beware the seemingly short life of this vacuum, although if you need something good and cheap for light vacuuming, this may work for you."
2,EASILY BROKEN,"I have owned the product for one month. While using it one day, I smelled what I believed to be rubber burning (the belt). I took off the bottom piece to check the belt and a large piece of plastic fell out. I replaced the contraption and tried to use the vacuum again, but now the belt will not stay in place, causing more damage. The vacuum worked well for the month I had it, minus the noise and weight. I contacted Bissell and they basically told me ""too bad, so sad."" Good luck returning it to the place you purchased it."
5,best upright vacume ever,"I just bought my Bissell about 3 weeks ago. I purchased this model because of the reviews on Amazon. Every one was right; this is a great vacuum, easy to use and fairly lightweight. It is great because the hose attachment is already attached, so as you are vacuuming if you want to use the hose, just pick it up and start using it. No attaching to anything. The vacuum is easy to clean, it is great not having bags and the filters are easy to wash and get to. The suction power on this vacuum is great. It has a wide clearance path and it is nice having the light. I would suggest buying it at Wal-Mart if not online. I bought mine at Kmart, because my husband did not want to shop around, & I saw it for $20.00 cheaper at Wal-Mart a few weeks later. Wish I would have bought it a long time ago!!"
1,Don't bother!!!,"I'm online looking for a new vacuum to replace my Bissell Cleanview which worked well for just one month. I wish I had just spent the money on a Dyson the first time around. This thing STINKS, literally, always has if I run it for more than 5 minutes. It hardly sucks up anything and the attachment hose is even more pathetic. Don't waste your money, don't go the cheap route, buy the best the first time and you will get your money's worth over the next several years!"
5,Shine shine shine,"I don't know why every woman doesn't use this, I've gotten tons of compliments since I started using it - makes one's hair super shiney."
5,"Duke, The real deal/a Great Album!!!","Great Album/ Songs...Wonderful!!!That's just an opener.Duke Levine is a rare artist-one that values solid songwriting, and playing which supports the song.Every tune on this CD feels right.Duke's playing is superb,tasteful-never overplaying ,or derivative-always soulful, gritty, melodic, and fresh-sounding!! I don't understand how Johnny A. garnered the press he did, while this CD flew beneath the radar;and, 'LAVA' was released earlier!!!Steve Vai should've been a bit more observant in his artist search...Duke is the real deal."
3,Fun send up to superheroes!,"I too liked this film a lot. It does have a cheapness to it, but that only adds to it. The acting REALLY is good. I thought this one actress, Louise Millmann, was very funny. She plays different roles and they're all great. I agree that Frances Lee, Jon Sanborne and Charlie Pelligrino are very good too. This is my favorite of all these low-budget films I've been buying lately."
4,You The Ant!!!!,"this is a truly great movie, that brings back a lot of memories of fun at the movies. this is a fun film, that anybody who enjoys a good time at the movies with great company will enjoy. Antz Rocks!"
4,Pretty Good Movie,I thought this movie was VERY funny. The Jokes where great the animations where incredible but the plot lacked something... Don't get me wrong it's a very good movie but there was just something missing here. I do reccomend it to adults and kids and I hope they enjoy it just as much as I did!
3,Umm.. Okay-this is good....,"I liked this movie's action, particularly the war scene with the termites. I thought that was really cool. And the animation was superb!It wasn't perfect, though. The plot itself needed a lot of work. A ant romance? For cryin' out loud! I know it IS a fiction movie, but geez! Have it make some sense!Also, I have to comment on the swearing. I'm all for swearing in movies-but only where it's NEEDED. The producers just added the language to put a bit spice in the movie, but it was out of place for a movie like this one. There was just no point to it!"
2,Okay Movie,"I don't like Woody Allen and I don't like Sharon Stone. Wait for a bug's life. While the menu's are good, the movie is way to scary for kids, and has to much cussing for my tastes. This movie is worth renting, nothing more. Dreamworks' only good movie is The Prince Of Egypt. Nice sound, Bad Layer Transition, and not that good picture"
2,This ain't no kid's movie,"Images of bloody, ripped up ant and termite bodies spread across a valley. A friendly wasp is flattened by a flyswatter. A few soldier ants are disentigrated by light beams. A decapitated ant dies in our hero's arms. With all this violence as well as the occaisonal four letter word, ANTZ seems less like a children's movie and more like some kind of obscure version of Steven Spielberg's SAVING PRIVATE ANT. Parents, a word of advise: If your kid is eleven or younger, don't let them see this movie. It helps reinforce the idea that death is funny, and we don't want our children turning out like morbid bullies. Adults, on the other hand, may be mature enough to like this film- the only reason I gave it less than 3 stars was because I was thrown off by the adult mood of what I thought was going to be a delightful children's movie."
1,THIS IS FOR KIDS?!,tHIS MOVIE WAS A BORE! ALL KIDS I'VE SEEN HATED IT! THEIR WAS TOO MUCH CUSSING AND TOO MUCH VIOLENCE. THE PLOT WAS HORRIBLE AND THE CONSTANT VOICE OF WOODY ALLEN WAS REALLY ANNOYING.
5,More than a kid's movie,"Antz has deep social issues within the movie. It follows the life of an embattled ant named Z (notice the name choice to signify the ""last"") and his struggle to break free from the grips of structured society. The hidden meanings are very deep and the animation and the acting are top-notch as well. This movie is not only for kids. Adults should watch it as well, and learn a thing or two about rising above the crowd. Highly recommended."
4,It's an ants world,"Woody Allen never looked better. It's enjoyable entertainment for adults and young teenagers. Little ones might find it not as appealing as ""A Bug's Life"" but it sure is worth a try. The language context maybe too much for youngsters under ten. Story is really simplistic, but who would want a complex story with ants? Overall I'd recommend this film to fans of animation. This movie shows that a whole scope of different films using this technology has yet to be made."
3,Why does it have to be a childrens film?,"Does it bother anyone else that everyone clasifies any animated movie as a children's film, and every live action as ""adult""? I mean Everyone: critics, parents, Blockbuster. If you are looking for a good movie for young kids, try ""The Little Princess,"" ""Fly Away Home,"" or the Disney marketing machine. This is an adult film that young minds are not likely to find entertaining or amusing, and may find frightening. As an adult film, it is a decent comedy presented with the most cutting edge technology of the moviemaking industry. This is the best special effects outside of B-grade sci-fi and horror."
2,Half-Baked Insect Epic,"I keep hearing how much better ""Antz"" is than ""A Bug's Life,"" though you'd have a hard time proving it from the actual movie. For all its claims of raising deeper issues and sophisticated allegories, what's the big deal if it doesn't bother to explore any of those issues? All too often, the filmmakers touch on things and then move on, ultimately saying nothing. The message of individualism especially seemed compromised by the ""everybody join together as one"" finale. The celebrity voices were distracting, and the battle scene was a bit ridiculous. Plus, why is Z's name an abbreviation for Z-and a bunch of numbers, while every other character in the movie has an individual name. Why is he the only one with a generic one? Too many plot holes, and no, it's not for most kids. I'll take ""A Bug's Life"" any day. Next time Katzenberg decides to steal an idea, make sure he has a better way to do it."
4,A bugs Life V Antz?,Why bother with the comparisons? Just thank the makers they bothered to entertain so well. If you like to get picky about it then you could think this. Antz has a better script and the scale is correct. A bugs life on the other hand is better animated (The bird is incredible!) and has a more diverse range of insect heros. Even if the Mantis wasn't much bigger then our hero ant...
2,Antz movie disappointment,I was disguised by the language of this movie as I watched it with my kids on Disney channel. This is not for children at all. When are there gonna b lines drawn in entertainment for kids protection not even the radio is safe.
3,not really for kids,"we rented this in hopes of finding a cute kids movie (since we heard so much about it) and were very dissapointed. if you want a good kids movie, get 'a bug's life', but steer clear of this one if you've got kids. the language and innuendoes and the fact that woody allen does one of the voices (well overrated as an actor) and you've got animated adult entertainment.funny for adults, too much for kids."
1,"To Scary for Kids, To Boring for Adults!","This movie was a disapointment! There was hardly any humor in it, draged on and on. The only positive thing I can say about this film was the grafics but one can get those same grafics watching a different movie! I didnt like this movie at all."
2,Antz,It was the worst film I ever saw in my life. Bechause there were beetles and they died. Woody aleen was my favoririte cast in the whole movie.
2,"Sorry Dreamworks, but you're not quite Disney!","Here's a tip...if you're going to watch Antz and 'A Bug's Life' then watch antz first so you don't get disappointed! The story line is a rather straight forward boring one...'Spend the whole time plotting what they're going to in secret, then in 3 minutes at the end the resolution takes place!' All drama's consist of EXPOSITION, DEVELOPMENT, CRISIS & RESOLUTION; Antz has EXPOSITION, RESOLUTION! Although the all-star cast helped the movie along, it does not compare to the genius of Disney. Sorry Guys!"
1,no movie,when opening the pacage there was no movie just a blank case when paying for somthing u should in return get somthing that u payed for
2,NOT FOR KIDS,I bought this for my kids and I was NOT happy when I heard cuss words and watched this video. Adults may like this video but I WOULD NOT ever reccomend it for kids.
1,Wonderful PG movie with CURSE words,"The story line of course is great, the movie looks great, but the dialogue has much to be desired. Watched with my children, and never watched again. This movie is the reason I watch ALL movies that are rated PG, BEFORE I allow my kids to watch them."
1,Not to be seen more than once!,This is an aful movie that I would never see again! It has a stupid plot and is more or less disgusting!!! This is not one to buy!
2,I did not like this movie,"... In this movie I want to take out a can of RAID. The ants were ugly and nightmarish. The animation was good. But the way the movie was presented turned me off. There are scenes, especially the decapitation scene, that would give small children nightmares. This film is definately not for small children. The movie even made me squimish. Plus I do not like Woody Allen. He always plays a wimpy, whinny nuerotic. Hearing woody Allen's voice just grates on my nerves. I gave the movie two stars instead of one because the animation was good."
2,Passable,"I'm one of the ones who places in the Bugs Life camp in the big war of the ants. Why? Well, for one thing, Antz features some of my least favorite actors. I'm sorry, but Sly Stalone and Sharon Stone just grate on me.Even Woody Allen was off in this one. By far one of his least funny films. The animation, though well done, is nowhere close to the quality of Pixar's.Those who like this film should at least give a viewing to ABL, as it's far superior in the voices/animation/story department."
3,Or maybe 3 and a half,"Antz is a good movie, and not at all boring, however, perhaps it missed the primary target audience a bit. Unlike Bugs Life, or more recent movies like Monsters Inc., Shrek, and others, this movie took a bit of a different tack. The actors providing voice overs here, Allen, Stallone, Stone, Hackman and others don't seem to hit the nail on the head when it comes to ""children's movies"" and since I'm not saying they were cast poorly, I guess I'm saying that the movie tries to be too sophisticated.It is entertaining, and I'd even say worth owning, but judging by how often we've viewed it compared to other similar movies, I just couldn't rate it as high."
2,Too much Adult Language for Children,"If this was supposed to be a kids movie there was too much profanity. It has an allstar cast, Stallone, Woody Allen, Sharon Stone, etc... The story is a bit slow. You keep waiting for something interesting to happen. The story concept ""finding Nirvana"" away from the colony was not one for an exciting story. The ""Evil Villan's"" plot makes no sense as to why he would want to do what he wanted to do. If you want to hear the voice of the stars in animated Ants then this is movie. Otherwise its not worth the money. I have no desire to see it again."
2,Adult movie disguised as kids movie,"If you are looking for a movie for your young child this is not the best choice...Antz has nice animation, and a okay plot, (even though the movie gets into the plot too soon in my opinion). Definitely not a kids movie, Im sure kids hear bad words from strangers, TV, ect, but if you try to monitor what your children watch (especially toddlers and young children) DO NOT BUY.If you decide to buy this movie, I recommend that you watch this movie with your kids and explain that certain words are not appropriate.Sample of words throughout the movie, hell, bi#*%, crap, idiot, dam* and a$$.I expected better from this movie, however it is a reoccurring theme throughout Pixar, Disney & other so called kids movies. With adult jokes and an inappropriate undertone in certain scenes."
4,An enjoyable animated piece,"Destined to be a classic, Antz has the star power that many big films have. Unlike the big films though, Antz has a charm and sophistication that one can't help but watch. I do not care for any other films with Woody Allen because I find him too annoying in them, but this one he actually has style and grace. Sly Stallone makes an impressive vocal for the largest and strongest soldier ant in the movie, who probably, also, has more heart than the others. At least, he means well. The film almost wants to make you watch where you step, ALMOST. GRADE: B"
4,A Good Film,"Perhaps I differ from others, but I found this to be quite a good movie (and I am a very honest critic). It was creative, entertaining, funny, and featured nice animation. Most of the humor is best understood by adults, which was satisfying. No, it was not a perfect film--but then, how many are? The truth is, this is a worthwhile, funny movie, and in my opinion it has been treated unfairly by many critics. See it for yourself and decide. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Sidenote: it was much better than 'A Bug's Life'."
2,Not a children's movie!!!! Should have been pg-13 minimum,"It starts off with a stuttering monologue by Woody Allen's character in a psychiatrist's office -- it was boring & clichéd. Fast forward 10 minutes to Sylvester Stallone's character saying ""what are you b*tchin about?"" *gasp* goes me....what on earth? But fortunately my child had zero interest and wasn't watching. I'm kicking myself for not paying attention to the reviews by others that mentioned the cursing -- I just saw an animated PG flick and bought it :-("
2,Dis-educational,"I would not expect any small children to learn much useful insect biology from this movie. The life history of ants is pretty far off the mark. In a real ant colony, all workers and soldiers are female. I gave it two stars because the animation is pretty good. Too bad all of the effort was wasted on this story."
3,Not for Families or Children,"Seriously disappointing. Lots of cussing, using God's name in vain. Military torture scene. Drinking beer. Very crude reference to drinking from the bottom side of an animal. Mean military commander dies violent death at end."
3,Not for kids,My husband really likes this movie but I would not allow my kids to watch it. There is a lot of swearing in it for a kids movie.
3,A Comedy That WorkZ,"Quirky, clever and highly entertaining, ""Antz"" is an intelligent and original movie that manages to convince both adults and children alike. Certainly one of the best animated pictures of the last years, this offbeat effort features interesting characters, a fluid and surprising plot, fresh dialogue and innovative animated sequences. The voices of Woody Allen, Sylvester Stallone, Sharon Stone and Gene Hackman also help to create an appealing and charismatic cast of characters. The story, while simple at its core, can actually deliver some food for thought about modern societies, control systems and relationships. All in all, an enjoyable and engaging cinematic experience.Very watchable."
5,language,"Just about perfect: special effects, sound, history and messages. But not easy when you're french and your kids are always asking:""what did he say?"". A french audio track should be fine."
5,"Michelle Dool Thorsby, Alberta April 22,1999","I thought the movie was great we took our children , all four and they sat there watching it, they loved the movie the ages ranges are 4x2 , 6 , 8 year old. We have seen the five times and they it love it everytime. We have now ready to buy it so we can watch it anytime we want."
3,Great animation but too violet for youngsters,I was dissapointed with the movie due to it's violent content and mature subject matter. This is not a movie for small children. I did however like the quality of the animation.
3,Fun to watch,"I would say Antz was a pretty good movie. I definitely think that little kids shouldn't watch it though. There are a few parts, especially the battle seen, that I don't think are very good for little ones to see, kinda scary. The only thing that I didn't care for very much was having Woody Allen as the main character. He's a little annoying. I do think that Sly Stallone did a good job though, I liked his character."
4,"Cute film, more mature than A Bug's Life","Both films came out around the same time, but this one is definitely darker than the other movie. Not dark enough to be R-rated or even PG-13, but this offers a more serious (if not entirely accurate) look at the lives of ants. How you like this film will depend on your tastes."
5,great movie!!,I just had to purchase this dvd since our older one was scratched. This one is a classic and must be in our library!
5,"Jennifer Lopez in ""Antz""",A restless worker ant trades roles with a soldier ant in an attempt to break free from his totalitarian society. He soon finds himself on the lamb with the princess and trying to win her affection.
5,THIS MOVIE IS ABOUT INDIVUALITY!,"All you little kiddies listen up. This movie is not just for kids. Its for adults too, spawning a film that can be enjoyed by all. And if you cant handle the extremely tame profanity in the film then dont meet people, dont go to school...hell, dont even leave the house cause theres words that'll give you a heart attack if you think Antz has bad language. This movie is well deserving of its 5 star statis because its all about fending for yourself and making your own choices and also adding light hearted romance along with this breath taking ride. Antz is by far one of the best films of the year and anyone who thought the movie was boring, I pity you. ANTZ IS WONDERFUL!"
3,"GOOD ANIMATION, BUT NOT STRICTLY FOR KIDS!!!","ANTZ WAS VERY ENTERTAINING. IT HAD NICE SPECIAL EFFECTS AND EFFECTIVE USE OF COLOR. THE SCRIPT HAD MORE ADULT OR OLDER TEEN CONTENTS INCUDED THAN I THOUGHT WAS APTLY NEEDED. THE VOICES WERE WELL MATCHED TO THE CHARACTERS. OVERALL, IT WAS A SAFE FAMILY FILM."
2,Not even close to bug's life,"This is a rip off from Bug's life as far as i'm concerned. A ""me too"" kind of film."
4,"Great New Pixar Graphics, Old Story","Characters include Woody Allen as a worker ant (the film's hero), Sylvester Stallone as an friendly soldier ant who gives Woody the chance to be a soldier and meet the queen, and then discovers that working as a tunnel digger is fun. Sharon Stone plays the rebellious, and sometimes confused, princess with the supposed destiny to marry the Army general (Gene Hackman) who is plotting to snuff out the existing colony and start his own. Woodie gets unexpectedly caught in a war with a termite colony - the war is urged by the Hackman, for reasons unclear in the film. Woodie is the only survivor, decides he wants to to to a fabled land for insects (actually a picnic ground) and ends up with Sharon Stone in tow. Woodie then discovers the general's dastardly plot, and races to save his fellow workers from certain death. The animation and clarity are excellent, per Pixar normal, but the story is a bit time-worn."
3,"Watch first, order later","I happened to buy this movie when the local DVD rental place was cleaning out overstock. The price was good, so I can hardly complain. And granted my kids are still little (3-4 years), but I can generally get them to sit through a movie in the afternoon. A sure-fire test: two little boys on the couch, if they sit enraptured throughout or fall asleep, then the movie is great - if they get off the couch and start playing with toys - movie can get passed on. I've tried a few times with this movie - they are completely uninterested. I am completely uninterested. For the most part, this movie sits in the back of the cabinet. I might try again in a few years, but maybe I'll just pass it along before then. My advice is to rent this movie first, see if the relevant persons enjoy it and then buy it if you like it. There are better movies out there!"
1,hillman,Not a movie for childran. My wife and I were both very disapointed with the language and the sexual comments. We gave it away.
2,didn't like the movie,"I watched this movie with my kids (8,6,4). Non of us enjoyed it. For them - it was way above their heads. I think they didn't understand half of what went on. Also I felt uncomfortable with some of the messages.They didn't ask to watch it again."
2,Antz,"Yawn, yawn.For me Woody Allen completely spoilt this film. He is yet again a character with an inferiority complex. Even hidden by beautiful computer animation, his ever depressive tone and stereo-typical casting, lead the viewer into complete apathy, and a longing he will finally solve his inferiority complex by committing suicide. When is Mr. Allen ever going to die ?"
1,Meade EXT125EC /uhtc w/ autostar,"A novice to astronomy i bought this unit with extra bells and whistles, thinking it would be a good intro to astronomy. I am completely disappointed and would never recommend it to anyone for any purpose other then a door stop. Unless you already have some knowledge of telescopes avoid it at all costs. Set up is difficult to impossible, and what eventually appears is not much better then what you can already see on a clear night. As far as i am concerned this purchase was a waste of money."
5,a fine source of information for people in the industry,"I found this book the best source of information. It covers all the products,trends, uses of products and solutions and even describes where the influences of each period come from. It does not have a 'how-to recreate...' section or photographs, but this is not what u want anyway. It helped me in every way when I had to research a period for a job or my assessments. I think it is a must have for every person involved with make-up, beauty etc."
4,Be Aware - this is an SDHC Card!,"Ordered this specific product as the title indicated MicroSD - no HC. When it arrived I didn't examine the package - like a kid at Christmas I simply dug in. When I was waiting the 3+ hours for MapSource to copy all of North America to my GPS, I finally examined the package and noticed the SDHC symbol. Luckily, my Garmin 60CSx was able to use the card without an issue.I don't plan on using the adapters, but the USB reader is pretty cool. The retention cable appears a little flimsy, but the concept and design is small, sleek, and functional."
4,ETX90EC or ETX90AT?,"I was under the impression that I had ordered an ETX-90AT (w. UHTC coatings)package for $499.00 (which is a $150.00 savings over standard price. I wondered if it was too good to be true. When I opened my package, the box said ETX-90EC on the outside and showed a picture of an 495 hand controller. I was dissapointed till I opened the box and saw an 497 AutoStar controller (w. Nov 2005 rev) and a deluxe field tripod (with carrying case). There was a note inside that said that this telescope had upgrades. The manual was for an ETX-90AT. I am extremely happy with the deal that I got and will use the money saved to by additional eyepieces. I wish there had been a deal on the ETX-125EC along the same lines. The only drawback is the small aperature of the 90mm, but it was a way to get a ""GOTO"" scope cheap. Maybe I'll get the 125 later if I like this one."
2,Marred by errors,"The book has very obvious errors. For example, AES/Rijndael uses 10, 12, 14 rounds for en/decryption, and not 9, 11, 13 as the authors claim on page 395.RC2, RC4, RC5 are not based on RSA, as the authors claim on page 396. It does not even make sense for a block cipher to be derived from a public-key cryptosystem such as RSA. RC5 admits a key size of 0 to 2040 (255*8) bits, not 0 to 2048 bits.There are so many more error that the readers should not take the technical accuracy of this book for granted."
2,Good enough to pass the exam -- despite some typos,"Overall, the book provides a good coverage of the exam material at a reasonable price and is easy to read, especially if compared to Harris book and the Official (ISC)2 Guide. At the same time, I noticed a few typos and inaccuracies, which was very unfortunate. That was why I gave it 2 stars instead of 4 that it deserves. At the end, it did the job, and I passed the exam, although, after reading this book, I reviwed a few CBK domains I was less familiar with in the Official (ISC)2 Guide. Unfortunately, none of the books I checked, including a more expensive Harris book and moreover, none of the cheap overviews like the Passport book, provides a 100% coverage of the material that is tested. Therefore, unless you have a real IT-related experience, you may be caught by surprise at the exam, no matter which book(s) you used. As for the typos, even the Official Guide has a few."
2,a CISSP exam cram indeed!,"The quality and contents of Sybex CISSP Study Guide is equivalent to a CISSP Exam Cram. It is very very brief and basic, not focused. Not even useful for a supplement reading. The questions are too simple as Boson's.CISSP Prep Guide 2nd Edition is brief but focused. Questions are well-designed.Comparing the prices with two authotitative CISSP books ie CISSP All-in-1 and CISSP Prep Guide, this so-called crammed book is rather expensive."
1,Extremely poor: Author is busy defending himself,"Everyone, avoid buying this book. There are many other books out there.As you can see on this page, one of the authors of this book tried to justify having made errors by saying other books have errors too. He also openly admitted having made contextual errors (which is extremely embarrassing) after being pointed out by one of his customers, but the author blasted him away and made no apology about selling incorrect data due to his ignorance and stupidity."
4,Very good resource,"I purchased and used both this text and the Shon Harris book. The text here is dry reading but very informative. As I got closer to taking the exam, I used it primarily for the practice exams and then used those to identify my weak areas. The practice exams give a very good breakdown by domain area of your strengths and weaknesses. I agree with another reviewer that the Shon Harris book is easier reading. If you are relatively new to the material and teaching yourself, you may want to go with that book as your primary text. However, if you are already pretty familiar with the material and knowledgeable about the technical aspect of networking, then this book would probably provide you more useful material. Both are outstanding texts but one is more useful than the other based upon where you are starting from."
5,Like No Other,My title says it all and I won't go into a long review because listening (to the cd) will make you a believer. I bought the CD back when it was first released and somehow lost it. This soundtrack has been haunting me for years. And now amazon gave me the opportunnity to download it in MP3 format. There are just so many memories this cd stirs from a time I was easily imppresionable. Listening to it again brings all the memories running back into my head. This isn't the only great work Mr. Blanchard has done. My hats off to a a man who is a true professional at his art. There is simply no one better.
5,Where is the song listing for this CD?,How can I view the songs listing for this CD? My rating is based solely on the one song I heard!
2,Disappointed,"I am a huge fan of Forever Amber and wanted to read more of Kathleen Winsor. This book was a disappointment because I thought it disjointed, constantly switching back and forth between a group of families out West and a family in the East. It contains great historical detail of the period, but I found it a frustrating read. I noticed that I was constantly reconstructing sentences to try to make the reading of it more enjoyable."
4,Nice Pickup. Really Loud!,"I chose this pickup because of it's output and eq (nice highs and mids, eazsy on the lows) . It's a neck position super distortion with added clarity and puch. I'm using it on a Stealth Esquire I made, using split coil option, and it has been great."
2,"2.5 stars, needs more excitement.....","Book description:Jessica O'neill's stage career made her the toast of London society. But no one suspected her true identity as a high-born young lady risking her good name to save her family from total ruin. And when the handsome Earl of Linton approaches her with an offer she can't possibly reject, jessica must learn to play a wealth- hunting wanton to the hilt- and avoid falling in love.....I was expecting so much more from this book since it had one of my favorite themes of the heroine as a mistress to the hero before the inevitable marriage, but there was nothing exciting about this book, on the contrary it was quite boring. The hero lacked personality and the storyline did not have that spark I was hoping for. If you like laid back romance without alot of serious conflict, then you might appreciate this book more than I did."
4,decent game,"The overall game was decent. It had great graphics, some things could only be obtained by using one character then switching off to the other, awesome music, and an interesting storyline. The only downside I could find was that the game was too short."
2,"not bad,took a few days to zero",this was actually a lil fun...i had exams when i got this game and i did not study! i just had to zero it! lol
3,Play it once...,"There is not much I can say about... I really enjoyed the graphics which were very smooth and detailed. That's one of the aspects I enjoy most in a game. Secondly, both characters are particularly different when choosing them to kick ass. THe big guy used a huge kind of club and I had lots of fun getting rid of villains. However, I felt like battles were really slow, particularly for the ""kamui"" skill system which stopped the actions of enemies so you could counter attack in a ""timed-press-the button"" sequence... FInally, I haven't felt like trying the game again... I suppose that's the most negative aspect of this game.... and some RPG's styles..."
2,Shameless Onimusha Ripoff,"WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE?!! This game is a shameless, pointless, ineffectual ripoff of the Onimusha series! I bought this game after reading the rave customer reviews, only to be gravely disappionted. I'll give it full points for beautiful graphics, but the combat is only barely better than button-mashing, you only get ONE magic ability -which is almost impossible to use unless you have the reflexes of an ACTUAL NINJA- and the boss-battles in the later stages of the game go beyond challenging to just frustratingly hard! If this genre appeals to you, play the Onimusha games -they're FAR BETTER. If you've already played the whole Onimusha series, either RENT this game out of mindless boredom or spend your money on something less boring. I just don't understand why everyone raves about this game... it's a shameless ripoff of the Onimusha series, but it's not even remotely as much fun!!"
2,this game come a different language,"Certainly this game is like movie, you have to wake in every scene, I dont undertand nothing, this languange is weird."
4,A Differant Book,"This book was much differant than I expected it to be. When my friend told me about it I figured it was just another one where the girl likes the guy and of course gets the guy in the end. Now it was somewhat like that, but she (Vicky) also faced other meaningful tough events.The beginning of the book was odd to me but by the end I was really enjoying it. The book started in a funeral and slowly set up what all was going on. It took me awhile to really understand all of the charactors, but it made the book better.I suggest this book to people who want a fun intersesting read. You also can't mind having a poem recited now and than. A Ring of Endless Light was good and I suggest it to almost anyone."
5,A Companion,"A Ring of Endless Light has lived beside my bed through high school and college--and promises to stay there. It can comfort or challenge, and I am always finding something new to ponder from a story now very familiar to me."
5,This was an absolutely wonderful book!!,"A friend told me to read this book and I am sure glad that I did. I connected with all the characters, especially Vicky. This is a wonderful, moving story that could only be topped by L'Engle herself."
3,A Ring of Endless Light,"I read a book called A Ring of Endless Light. This book is one of the many books by MadelineL&#65533; Engle. This book goes along with the Disney movie called A Ring of Endless Light.I read this book after I saw the movie. Everybody should read this book because it is a great book because it has dolphins and I love dolphins. I also love horses. A character in the book, Vicky, can communicate with the dolphins. She is visiting her grandfather on Seven Bay Island. Vicky Goes to Second Bay Stables to ride horses. It is a Newbery Honor Book.In this book one person dies, and a female dolphin gives birth to her first pup (a dolphin baby). One of the characters can talk with the dolphins so they can communicate. All in all A Ring of Endless Light is a good book, but I thought it was very boring.If you like Madeline L&#65533;Engle I would suggest you read it, but I if have never read a book by her should read A Wrinkle in Time, first."
1,Madilene L'Engle- Fredrick Smitty,"My book review is on &#65533; A Ring of Endless Light&#65533;. It&#65533;s about a girl named Vicky Austin. The other main characters are Zachary, Adam, and Leo. The story takes place on &#65533;Seven Bay island&#65533; off the coast of New England.Her friend Adam is a marine biologist.He has two dolphins he is studying . One day Vicky goes to meet them , and she figures out she can talk to dolphins telepathicly. Also 3 people die in the book and her grandpa has leukemia.This book is about how confusing it is to be a teenager. The moral of the story is people die and that&#65533;s life. I do not recommend this book to anyone, but if you are going to read it I recommend it to ages 8 and up. Because it practicly has no plot and it&#65533;s very bad."
5,This is one of my favorite books!,I really loved this book. I relate to Vicky Austin completely. In this book she has to deal with many life and death situations that mold her future. Coming to accept death she is made a stronger person. But in a way known to only a few of us that have expierienced what she has. Her feelings are made very clear and distinct. It made me feel I was living right along with her in the book. And for those who crave a little romance this is the best book for you. THIS IS A MUST READ!!!!!
5,"5 Star Book!!! Holds depth, emotion, and gravitas.","Ever since I picked ""A Wrinkle in Time"" off the library bookshelf in 4th grade, Madeleine L'Engle's works have intrigued and captured my attention. Although all of Ms. L'Engle's books are superbly written, ""A Ring of Endless Light"" is my all-time favorite book. The dialogue and setting descriptions are captivating. The talented way she wrote in 1st person allows the reader to understand who the ""real"" Vicky Austen is while feeling like they're part of the story, and getting inside the character's thoughts. The way Ms. L'Engle opens the character's thoughts to the reader seems, to me, to resemble the way dolphins' thoughts flow to Vicky. Indeed, ""A Ring of Endless Light"" is a ""must-read book."""
5,An extra-ordinary book that I really enjoyed reading.,This book is wonderfully written and I highly suggest you read it. I could relate to Vicky's feelings and loved the way she reacted to the dolphins and how they reacted to her. I enjoyed it and it really made me think when I was finished. I wanted it to keep going. You should read it.
5,dis book is the best ever,This book is the best. I like how it has a teenage dealin with problems.I just love books tha have boy problems in it.I also cant wait to watch the movie on disney.arr am so exicted to see the movie. I hope its as good as the book.
3,A Ring of Endless Light,"I read a book called A Ring of Endless Light. This book is one of the many books by Madeline L' Engle. This book goes along with the Disney movie called A Ring of Endless Light.I read this book after I saw the movie. Everybody should read this book because it is a great book because it has dolphins and I love dolphins. I also love horses. A character in the book, Vicky, can communicate with the dolphins.

All in all A Ring of Endless Light is a good book, but I thought it was very boring.If you like Madeline L'Engle I would suggest you read it, but I if have never read a book by her should read A Wrinkle in Time, first."
3,Review of A Ring of Endless Light,My Little girl is right in the middle of this book and she loves it! I however am very dissappointed that there are curse words in the book. My child was very upset with that part of it. I feel like the book can be just a good without the curse words in it.
5,One of my Favorites,"L'Engle does a superb job exploring the complex world of relationships, death, and the life of an adolescent girl. I cannot recommend it any more highly."
5,It speaks the truth about a lot of hard issues!,"If you're looking for a book that has a great plot and intriguing characters, then this is it. Vicky Austen is having a problem with death going on all around her...a darkness that seems to want to swallow her whole. She finds refuge within Adam, one of the three boys who are interested in her, and his project with dolphins. Then, when the darkness finally seems to swallow her, she returns to the dolphins, and Adam, who fight to bring her back into the light, to take her place as a light-bearer. I loved it so much I bought it to read over and over again!"
5,A Must-Own Book,"Nearly 20 years old, this is still my absolute favorite book. L'Engle write with prose that feels like poetry--this is L'Engle at her best. And even though this book is part of a series, it can be read and understood on its own, or read in context with the other Austin family books. I have never had a book touch me quite as deeply as this one. I highly recommend it to young teens, old teens, and even adults. Vicky's struggles and insecurities touch the reader on many levels--on subjects such as death, prayer, relationships, and family.This is a book I plan to keep and give to the children I might have someday. I can't come up with words strong enough to express how powerful this book is. Read it for yourself. Enjoy."
5,Loved It!!!!,"I absolutely loved this book!!!! I really enjoyed how Vicky worked w/ the dolphins, and found that extra sense that she had. I also loved the love story that L'Engle developed between Vicky and Adam. It kept me reading always wanting to know what happened. I thought this was a fabulous wonderful book, and will recommend it to many people!!!"
5,A great part of the Austin series,"I love this book. I first read it years ago as a child. I have reread it several time since and don't ever tire of the story or of the message. Vicky Austin is struggling through adolescence, feeling confused and unsure of herself. Her family is spending the dummer on Seven-Bay Island where her Grandfather lives. They are there because he is dying. The summer presents a lot of challenges for Vicky, both full of joy and full of sorrow. Choosing the light, rather than darkness, and standing up and recognizing that there is good in the world are poignant and appropriate themes for this day and age."
5,Best Book ever!,"Once I started to read this book it grabbed me and wouldn't let me go. The amazing words and the web of confusion is perfect for a good book to read a time when you have a lot of open mind space. This book means many things. It shows you Vicky's feelings and how she is struggling between the three guys. It finally starts building to a climax at the end and you can almost predict the ending. This book is better then some of her other books. You are in the story with her and seeing all that she sees. Overall, best book ever!"
5,One of L'Engle's best,I love this book. No better explanation. (And I'm also already in love with Adam.)
3,Boring music,"Actually I like the nature sounds recorded in this CD. It is real and smooth. But the music does not match the forest mood created by the nature sounds. The music is simply boring and sometimes too soft. You can hardly hear to it when there are noises beside you.I mildly like the first track and the fifth track. But the others do not match with the forest birds, or sometimes too short. It would be even better if this album presence nature sounds only."
1,Madacy = below 0,"First you're attracted by the price, and then, if you already got the misfortune of acquiring Madacy's product(s), you know it's not even worth that price, since they usually manage to get the worst print they can fish from garbage AND then succeed in making it worse. The fact they're not yet out of business is only the proof for garbage lovers (I've been conned twice, and that's more than enough) being innumerable."
1,Received wrong DVD in Wrong Case,I ordered the DVD Dr. Jeckyll and Mr Hyde and today I opened up the dvd and the dvd inside the case is the Jackals. Really not what I ordered.
1,Don't buy this product!,"This product does leave a mark on your skin as it implies. However the ""ink"" is very gummy and hard to get a good coverage on the design. The package states that the design will be a bluish black, but after leaving it on the skin, it looks like washed magic marker. it is not dark at all. the covering that you must put over it to set the design prevents you from seeing if any of the ink has seeped out side the design area, creating the problem of stray splotches of ""ink"" other than the design. i do not reccommend this product at all."
5,The life of Britannicus Caligulae Servus,"This is the fictional autobiography of Britannicus Caligulae Servus, a rare treasure pulled out of the Burroughs vault. Britannicus, the slave of the mad Roman emperor Caligula, goes through many exiting adventures as he grows more and more weary of his overlords. It is an example one of Burroughs' only bittersweet endings, but it is a remarkable tradegy by the Master of Adventure which no ERB reader should miss. It's too bad it's currently out of print."
4,"Buy, Capitalist!","With most bands, you only get one version of a specific song. Occasionally, extended mixes, remixes, live or demos show up. The reason I mention this, as is readily apparent if you've read anything on this...is that these are re-recorded studio versions. Excellent...and now we have two studio versions of these tunes. Considering the price, well worth it!"
1,Not so Entertaining,"I bought this because I didn't want to buy a cd to replace my well-worn album. Entertainment! is by far their best album; this is a lame reworking of the songs on that (mostly) with some cuts from their other albums as well.Maybe it's because I grew up on the originals, but I think this cd sucks. However, it's still ten times better than most stuff out there, so I gave it 3 stars. The melodica is missing is some spots, the guitars sound less jagged, and the drums have lost a lot of zing, particularly on what we all want. So, if you don't have any gang of four, get this, then get entertainment."
1,Damaged Goods,"This is the worst idea a band has ever had. In particular, ""damaged goods"" is destroyed, removed of all of its original amazing tension. What we have now is an accomplished pub band rehashing past glory. Sad sad sad. Ladies and gentleman, give me Interpol over this. It pains me to say this."
1,"Cash In Now, Honey!","A cynical grab for more moolah. ""Wow! These guys are real rebels with something real to say!"" Sorry, this re-recording exposes them as the poseurs they apparently always were. Hey guys, how about writing some NEW music? Oh, that's right. Whatever spark you had went out decades ago.I'm sure I would still have a good time seeing them live, but sadly, they have turned into a nostalgia act. Even the cover is a tired, boring re-hash. This GIFT should be returned."
2,workbook,"While this was a good workbook and general review, it was practically worthless to me as a study guide for the NCLEX exam. Not only did I find errors in the book (EKG mislabeling), but there weren't very many NCLEX questions at all, and the ones they had were too easy. The computer questions don't give rationales for the right answers, either. If you want to brush up on physiology, this is a good starter, but don't expect to pass the NCLEX with just this book."
2,Be Warned!,"I was pretty disappointed in this book. While I enjoy the occasional romance novel, I am wary to pick up a book by a cross-genre writer like Vella Munn. Its the story of a young woman Twana who has a special power to be able to locate animals, and even in one case, talk telepathically to them. Twana's mother disappeared many years ago, and both she and her mother have been surrounded by abusive, conniving men. Until the insipidly instant love of her life kidnaps her, and together they are able to work through their past traumas and live happily ever after.There! You know the story and that's about as exciting as it gets. It's very negative to most of the men in the novel as a way to make the main male character more attractive and lovable to the reader.This book isn't worth your time or money. This book belongs off the shelves of fantasy and back among the ""bodice rippers."""
5,Nice Condition,The seller delivered the book in a very good condition just like they said. So good job!!
4,Awesome Game!!!,The graphics are awesome. I thought I was playing Half Life 2. The game play is easy and unpredictable. I highly recommend it.
2,"Sort of like Half-Life 2, but much weaker","Having finished playing Half-Life 2, I bought this game after reading positive reviews on the internet and hoping for ""more of the same"", to be honest.Sin Emergence uses the same graphics engine as HL2, the action and gameplay are similar, the graphics and environments are similar, but the storyline is weak, as well as the level designs, there are to few different enemies, and the characters, both friend and foe, are tasteless and unappealing.It is probably a bit unfair to write a review strictly based on what other games have to offer, but if you are hesitating between this game and Half-Life 2, you should DEFINITELY get HL2. If you have already finished HL2 and are looking for something similar, you will be disappointed with this one.Knowing what other FPS games are out there, I really can't see myself recommending this game to anyone."
3,Just as pictured...,"Considering I paid $1.98 for this 11.5 in. stuffed toy, I certainly got my money's worth! If you're looking for a realistic stuffed replica of a female lion, look elsewhere; this is more like a medium-sized prize you might win in a ""claw machine"" or get as a giveaway. It's certainly big-cat in shape, but not marked at all like a female lion, and lacking a tail-tuft, so there's not much ""educational value"". HOWEVER - I thought the markings were interesting, so I specifically bought it based on the image, and I was very pleased with this item. It was indeed exactly as pictured, black ears and nose, large spots and all! There is not a lot of detail besides the interesting markings, but for the price it's a bargain if you like unusual stuffed animals."
1,Very disappointing,"Item arrived in box that is torn and damaged beyond reason, was poorly constructed, and a complete waste of time and money. I wouldn't recommend this item to anyone for any reason."
5,WHY AM I THE FIRST PERSON TO REVIEW THIS AMAZING BOOK???,"This is a captivating, heart warming story of a five year old girl, who is sent to live with her grandfather, high on the swiss alps...Heidi's grandfather lived the life of a hermit, up on the mountain, rarely seen by anyone, untill Heidi, his only grandchild, comes from her aunt, who has looked after her since the death of her parents, to live with him. Heidi worms her way into the grumpy old man's heart in a way that no-one ever thought possible, with her childish affections, and the belief that her grandfather can do no wrong...But when Heidi is sent to live in the city, what will happen???'Heidi' is a simply written story that will captivate, and warm the hearts of all readers."
2,An Entertaining work of Fiction,"I read this book back in the 90's when I was a teenager. Even then, it struck me as being someone's sick fantasy. I have to say, though, it wasn't a bad read, if you don't take it seriously. Holy, buhjesus is that woman nuts. If you want to get into the mind of a true whack job, this book is it!!I know, we live in a world where a lot of terrible, sad things happen to our children. Ritual abuse and human trafficking DO exist. But this book harms the credibility of the real victims.There are no names, dates, locations or any other tangible evidence to prove her claims. She's just a charlatan trying to get attention and sympathy. It's sad, because she was known to be intelligent, and quite a talented musician. She could have gained recognition for something constructive, had she not let these satanic, sexual fantasies take over. Later on, the Lauren (Wilson) Stratford pretended to be a holocaust survivor, Laura Grabowski."
1,Known Fake Still Fools Gullible Consumers,"I'm staggered by the number of readers who continue to defend this con-woman. For heaven's sake people, Laurel Rose Wilson (aka Lauren Stratford, aka Laura Grabowski) was exposed by Cornerstone 20 years ago (and to preempt claims that this expose was a secular smear campaign, Cornerstone is a Christian magazine).After Cornestone's damning description of her long history of mental illness and false abuse allegations, Stratford/Wilson's publisher withdrew her books from the market. However, Wilson was not about to give up on the fame and fortune she had enjoyed, and reinvented herself as a fake Holocaust survivor, Laura Grabowski.It's hard to say what combination of mental illness, lust for fame, or criminal greed motivated Wilson's exploitation of past victims and present suckers. But every self-deluded Christian who buys her books is essentially funding a campaign of fraud and deception."
1,A Serial Hoaxer who Hurts True Victims by Helping Deniers,"This book is a hoax. Moreover, Lauren Willson/Stratford also has claimed to be a Jewish girl, Lauren ""Grabowski"", who knew Bruno Grosjean Dossekker/""Binjamin Wilkomirski"" in a children's home in Krakow as a fellow Holocaust victim, corroborating his book ""Fragments"". The Holocaust, of course, did happen, but when ""Fragments"" was exposed as complete fraud, Lauren's story fell apart, too. It appears that she makes a life of falsely portraying herself as the victim of atrocities, with the result, after her inevitable eventual exposure, of damaging those others who truly ARE such victims."
1,Pure Rubbish,"Thanks to this disturbed women, whos real name is Laurel Rose Willson, this book inspired much of the Satanic Panic that plagued the country through the late 80's to early 90's. Many innocent people's lives have been shatterd and destroyed thanks to overzealous law enforcment and the fear of this ""underground satanic cult"". The other reviews do a good job of explaining when and how the book was proved a falsehood. The last I heard about this author she was now going by the name of Laura Grabowski and she claims to be a Jewish Holocaust survivor. Please do not purchase this and allow any chance of this liar receiving any royalties. It shouldnt even be allowed in print."
3,I'M SorRy..,"I thought this was exposed as a work of Propaganda by a woman who needed something. a book exposed by Christians. well.. I don't kNow. I'm just wary. Perhaps she did breed babies or satann, who knows. Now Warnke on the other hand.."
5,"For a first book, Ms. Ottey did an superb job!","The book ""Jamerican Connection"" is set in a seemingly timeless Jamaica, where you can feel and taste the country's landscape. The book deals with relationship issues which most people can and will relate to (no matter what their origin.) For many Jamaicans with ties across the seas, esepcially in the U.S., the relationship issues of both parties abroad and in Jamaica, are real. I found the series of events interestingly captivating, and its end hopeful."
4,Love conquers all---long or short distance,I really like Miss Ottey's writing style. The author describes infidelity just like it is...no gimmicks. I really connected to the sub-plot with the professor living in Brooklyn and her musician boyfriend living in Jamaica. Long distance relationships can be really painful at times but love conquers all.
1,Get what you pay for,Item came in damaged. Vendor contacted by e-mail about how everything was with product. I let them know my concerns. Never receieved e-mail back. To cheap of a product to waste my time with.
1,low quality,cheaply designed. It is not stable on the floor. Had a small crack when I received it. Will look for a better one.
1,Terrible Product,"When you buy a cheap lighting product, you pretty much expect something to be wrong with it out of the box. This one, though, takes the cake. First, it buzzes loudly whenever turned on. Second, the stand is made of a flimsy quasi-tinfoil material that wobbles and seems unable to support its own weight. It's been three days since we've had it, and it's already bowed. Third, the cans which hold the lightbulbs are horribly flimsy plastique and don't correctly align with the bulb-stands. The joint-grooves of the cans are somehow already stripped, causing one of the three lights to point limply at the ground.So, we bought junk knowing it was junk. But somehow, this remarkable confluence of such multiple levels of shoddy craftsmanship still managed to surprise us. Possibly the worst product ever constructed by sober or at least light-responsive vertabrates.Well played, Grandich Corp!"
1,Horrible Product,"I buy lots of stuff online, but usually don't bother leaving reviews. But I've had enough of this lamp, and right now was the last straw: the lamp was standing peacefully in the corner, and a ""piece"" of the plastic shade just broke and fell off. How a piece of plastic could break off and fall without any disturbance is beyond my comprehension.The lamp is extremely weak and unbalanced, the shades are so flimsy that they fall off if you as much as lift the lamp off the ground, and the cheap-plastic look is terrible.For $25 I would expect a very nice lamp, given that you can get much better matte-metallic ones at Target for $10.This manufacturer needs to be taken out of business ASAP!!"
3,You get what you pay for.,"Just as the title says, these lamps are $24.95 and I don't think they are worth even that much. I bought these for my office and they look like $24.95. They would be good for a dorm room or a kids room but if you are looking for something that looks nice, move on."
1,JUNK shouldn't even deserve one star...,"This product is constructed of cheap plastic... shades, joints, everything! The post does not assemble correctly and therefore leans or tilts to the side. The tiny lightweight base does not adequately support the top heaviness of the lamp and the entire lamp easily falls over. The lamp head joints do not swivel without out force which will crack them. The lamp shades do not stay on, and upon one of my attempts to replace the lamp shade, my hand was cut on the sharp plastic edges. This product should be taken off the market. It is a FIRE and CHILD SAFETY HAZARD!"
1,"Garbage, Garbage, Garbage","Garbage light. I am not hard on my stuff. The pivot points are so poorly designed that should you actually adjust your lights on a semi-regular basis it will break. After the 2nd one broke in the same exact way I knew it was just a poor design. The plastic ring where the arms of the light go into the pole actually split down the side so despite no matter how much glue, epoxy or duck tape you use, it's just not enough. At least in my experience. Besides, this is in the dining room. Who want's a frankenlamp? My advice? One that's metal. Or at least not the cheapest floor lamp out there. I totally got what I paid for. A temporary fix to lighting my apt. I have one light left on this thing. At least that's firmly attached. The other 2 are still technically there. Just broken hanging off the side."
1,disappointed,This book was not what I expected it to be. I was looking for a resource to offer instant activities. This was not it.
3,Satisfactory only,"The music in this album has sucessfully created the spirit of a giant ocean. But the humpack whales sounds in track 3 are annoying and does not like the feeling of seeing whales in the ocean on a ship.Also, track 4 does not quite create the mood ""Pacific Suite"" , the mood of the track is just ""songbirds by the stream"".So this is satisfactory only. That's quite unusal for Dan Gibson's production."
5,Joe vs. Both Church And State...,"Released after 40 years of imprisonment, COFFIN JOE (Jose Mojica Marins), w/ the aid of his faithful henchman, Bruno, returns to his quest for immortality through an eeevil offspring. This time out, JOE and a small band of followers must battle a wicked police force, a maniacal priest, and a pair of blind witches! Of course, much blood-letting, nudity, and death ensue! Will CJ finally get what he so desires? EMBODIMENT OF EVIL sums up everything, culminating in a fitting showdown in a carnival house of horrors. Wonderful stuff! Enjoy..."
5,Little Brothers offers big scares,"This is my all time favorite Hautala novel. A little boy sees his mother killed by 'little brothers' that live in underground tunnels that criss cross his hometown. Now the monsters want him as well. Of course, being a Hautala novel, there is a lot more going on in the tightly wound plot than first meets the eye. The reader of this book is in for a real treat. Recommended."
1,Great Look Poor Material,"Purchased loved it, then the black coloring started to break off in various parts of the belt. Left a few emails at Kenneth Cole and got no reaction. I will never buy Kenneth Cole again. Good luck"
1,"Bad belt, lasted 1 week",This belt lasted 1 week. Its a laminated 2 piece belt that after 1 week the belt split into 2 pieces. Would look for a different belt.
1,Bad quality,"I have got Kenneth Cole products before (shoes), and they used to be made with quality material. I was really dissapoint for the quality of this belt. They say it's made of leather, but it's a very bad leather. Get a belt from another brand...."
2,Huge Fan...Huge disapointment. Pollard too drunk!,"I am a huge fan of this band and have all of their cd's but this live document could've been much much better. At times Pollard is way too drunk and yea yea yea I know thats part of his persona but cmon pal, you sounded like an obnoxious drunk frat boy on Kareoke night. If this was supposed to be a farewell performance and gift to the fans...treat us with respect and keep your booze in check until after the lights go down!"
3,Bob couldn't stay sober for one night?,"This recording is a perfect example of the schizophrenic nature of Guided By Voices. Disc one has some of the bands less compelling songs that are made much more immediate and substantial due to the incredible performance by the band. Disc two has some examples of modern rocks best songwriting ever and the bands drunken, sloppy playing diminishes this material enormously. I've been looking for great live recording of GBV for years because their preferred Lo-Fi style of record making always seemed too experimental to me, so unpolished that people assumed they couldn't play their instruments or Bob couldn't sing. If Bob had just stayed sober for this one evening his fans could have had a high quality recording of most of their great material, but instead we have another uneven and frustrating example of Bob Pollard and GBV's genius and self destructive behavior. This easily could have been a five star review if disc two lived up to the promise of disc one."
3,"Some good, some not so good","This is probably not an album for the casual fan, but still worth owning for most. Pollard and Nate Farley have too much to drink and it comes through loud and clear on too many tracks, particularly on the second disc. The drunken karaoke version of ""Cut-out Witch"" is, in my opinion, unlistenable.Having said that, there are still some real gems here. ""Glad Girls"", ""Echoes Myron"", and ""Redmen and Their Wives"" are all good. ""Sleepover Jack"" is also well done.All in all, this CD is an accurate depiction of the last few GBV shows I went to. The band and audience have a lot of drunken fun at the show, but that just doesn't translate into a great audio CD."
5,Drought with dream,"This is a beautiful, expertly painted story about two men and their love for each other, their city, and honor. The implications of this love are left ambiguous. One feels as if he has indeed drunk the last of the wine, and it brings about a wonderful, sad dream."
5,I've read and re-read this book a few times!,"And I have been recommending this book to many people ever since. It is gripping, exhilarating, sad and everything else in between. Mary Renault's writing, as always, is lucid, imaginative and richly textured. It is about friendship and love."
3,Not her best,"I've read several of her books and this book is good but not as good as the others. I found quite a few sentences to be so awkward that I had to go back and re-read them to understand what she meant. Also, as in common with her other books, there is not a trace of humor, which can be kind of taxing after a while. Finally, I would shave about 50 pages, as it drags in parts."
5,Heartbreaking and Inspiring,"One of the most tender and beautiful depictions of a love relationship between two men that you will ever read. Literary but accessible, The Last of The Wine truly captures the spirit of ancient Greece. You won't be disappointed."
1,If you don't like homosexual themes...,"Don't read this book! It's laced with homosexual themes and descriptions of homosexual acts between Alexias (the narrator) and Lysus his older male lover, as well as many other characters. The jist of the story seems to me to be more aimed at describing Alexias and his feelings toward other men than telling the story of Athens from an economic and political standpoint. This book seems to be a requirement for many college history classes so consider yourself warned! I think this book was a major waste of time, there are definately better ways to learn the history of Athens for that time period. Alexias wasn't even a real person for crying out loud! He was fictional!"
3,Could have used good editing,"I've loved all of Mary Renault's work until The Last of the Wine. While the story is nearly as compelling as the rest and she has a lovely use of language, the Arrow Books edition I bought is laced with spelling errors and the book needed far better editing than it received to make the story flow smoothly."
1,The Last of the Wine is the Last Renault I'll read!,"The book takes place in Ancient Greece. There is a map and a glossary of Greek terms, but referring to that grows old pretty quickly! If you have studied Ancient Greece and are familiar with Greek terms, you might find the setting more appealing than I did. The characters are predominately male (all but one) and go about their day wrestling, hunting and fighting wars. Their names run from familiar to difficult to pronounce. The author spends an inordinate amount of time with descriptions of irrelevant events. She uses run on sentences and nonsensical similes. This book put me to sleep if I tried to read it late in the day. If you choose to read it, I advise reading in the morning!"
4,With The Grain is a terrific little book!,"This is a terrific book and, as far as I can tell, it's been completely overlooked. I don't know why it hasn't received more critical attention.The author, a Fullbright scholar, former Food editor for the New York Times, and Leisure & Arts editor for the Wall Street Journal, is extremely well-read and eloquent in this concise but thorough book that details the world's grains. From oats to grits, farro to quinoa, it's all there, with recipes from around the world to illustrate how each is used.Note that even though it's about grain, normally the province of vegetarians, this is not necessarily a vegetarian's cookbook. Many of the book's recipes include meat.This book could be especially useful for those who've decided to cut back on meat and change the focus of their diet to grain, but it would be handy on any cook's shelf. I turn to it again and again as both a reference and a cookbook. It's fully indexed, well organized and highly recommended."
2,Disappointing,"I really like nature cds and I like classical music as well so I had hoped combining them would result in a great mix. This cd seemed to take away from the effect of each though. Every song had the formula: insert 10-15 sec. nature type sounds, play poor rendition of classical song with light nature sounds background, end with 10-15 more sec. nature type sounds. Not worth the money at all. This may just be a bad cd but I found it much more enjoyable to listen to the styles separately."
1,scam artists,does not work does not really fit this does not even belong on amazon its such a scam- (...)
5,The high point of his career,"Of course, you get the MTV hit ""salt of my tears"", but the other cuts on this album have a lot of merit, too. There is a variety of tempo, from the hard rockin' ""I wonder what she thinks of me"" to the fun/frantic ""One night with a stranger"" to several slower numbers. Make sure to listen to the lyrics, as they are more than half of the fun.This album is more consistant than the first album and MUCH better than dangerous moments. It is probably one of my top-20 all time albums. I had it on vinyl and then bought the boxed set (my recommendation, as it contains all three of his early albums at a very good price).Absolutely a unique artist who is vastly underrated / unknown."
4,A lot of great information in a little book,"Mozart:A Life packs a lot of great detail about the life of one of the greatest musicians to ever live. For a serious student, this book would form a good base of knowledge. The causal reader will both be entertained and enriched by the knowledge of the man and his immense musical genius. The reader will gain a greater understanding for the operatic form that Mozart loved. I consider my investment of time in reading this book well spent."
3,A Short Biography of a Genius,"Peter Gay's book on Mozart is truly utilitarian, just a short book with all the facts and a few minor clarifications on the folklore surrounding Mozart. The author follows his subject chronologically, with a special emphasis on the familial relationships and Mozart's unusual correspondence.Gay suggests that Mozart's achievements as a child prodigee may have been partly the work of an ambitious father. Gay also puts to rest the enduring rumours that Mozart was poisoned, murdered by a patron, or buried in a pauper's grave. None of these actually happened, despite what we have seen on the silver screen the last 30 years.The book is well written, Gay is an entertaining and thorough author, but dont expect anything really new or controversial here."
2,Mozart... A Fast Food Biography,"If you need a book in order to waste 10 minutes while waiting in line somewhere, and you don't know a thing about Mozart this book will work for you. The book is extremely simplistic, details are glossed over, and is an uneventful read. Mozart; with all his brilliant compositions deserves more than this."
1,Poor description,The information for this book should have noted that there was a black remainder mark on the book. It was to have been a gift - with a remainder mark???
4,Enjoyable and Informative,"Another in the Penguin Lives series, this is a short, reasonably informative, easy-to-read bio of Mozart, who was (by modern standards) one weird fellow. Author Peter Gay has successfully avoided the heavy-handedness present in some of his other works (e.g. in the ""Bourgeois Experience"" series), and the result is a pleasant stroll through the late 18th century. Gay concentrates more on Mozart the person rather than on Mozart's music, although the evolution of Mozart's style is an important theme.A quick, easy, enjoyable read."
5,Works as advertised,"Shipped from Fox Run Tools. Arrived in 2 days and in excellent condition.Used only once to start a big V8 with a totally dead battery (car was trapped under snow in NY for more than 3 weeks). Car started on first crank. Can't forecast how this device will hold up, but it's already paid for itself. Highly recommended."
3,nice unit for occasional use,"First off let me just say that this unit is a heck of a lot better than the ones in your box stores. I have a construction company so there is always something with a dead battery everyday. This unit works good for the first, second, and 'sometimes' third jump but that's usually it. After about 8 days of heavy use I can only get the unit to recharge to about 70%- I may return it. My only other complaint is that when you are in a hurry and wrap the cables back up its very easy to slice into the cable with the handles."
5,Good jump starter,I purchased the JNC660 jump starter. It is a quality product. Have some large engines to start and this unit easily cranked them. Short recharge time. Should have gotten this long ago.
4,Works great so far,"I bought this jump box after I was rescued with a similar one at the drag races. I charged it for 24 hours like the instructions said. I put it on my son's 70 Dart 340. The battery and car have set for at least 2 years without running. It took a good bit of cranking to get fuel up to the carb, but the JNC 660 worked great and got the car running. I'm giving this a 4 star because I've only used it once. If it proves to be reliable long term, I would give it 5 stars."
1,"No way to charge it, no extension cord included",Come on! my battery is dead and the only thing include is the DC male-male extension cord.How do I charge it at home without a extension cord ( NOT PROVIDED ) The most expensive Jump Started at Amazon and no way to charge it right out of the box? I feel beyond mad!!!
4,Worked great even in cold temperature.,I had to start a 3/4 ton chevy truck with dead battery in 10 degree F. I worked no problem and the unit wasn't at full charge.
5,A MUST HAVE...,"This is a very powerful and easy to operate Jump Starter. I've used it a couple of times and was quite satisfied with how fast it started my car. As a result, I highly recommend it to any potential buyer!"
5,A companion for every driver,"I love this jump starter. I bought this device to prepare for the cold winter because my Odyssey had trouble starting the engine. The first time I used it, it made me smile. The vehicle started right away! No long cable or trying to get someone to give me a jump. That is important when I am traveling. Now I know my trusty friend is alway traveling with me. I highly recommend the JNC660 Jump Starter. I used my fullly charged unit twice, and the gauge needle barely moved from the green area, which indicating the device is fully charged. So, do yourself a favor, buy this jumper. A very good investment and peace of mind."
4,Works great but one annoying design flaw,This works great but gas one crucial design flaw I would personally change which is the charging cord. You need an extension cord to charge it when it would be so much easier to have just put a one or two foot long cord on the charger. Other than that no problems! Works great!
5,perfect,I deliver atv's that have no batteries. I can jump 8 without any problem before recharging. It will handle anything you need it to.
5,this thing is a beast,"super powerful, lasts long. I've had it for 4 months and I'm doing my best to keep it charged and it's not letting me down. others have complimented on its superiority to their costco garbage"
5,Awesome,Awesome I have a 400 Big block in my truck and after sitting for a while i use this thing and it fires up instantly. Build strong it seems. my only complaint might be the plug in in the front. its just two prongs sticking out although its inserted an inch in and kinda protected still could hit something and break. cool product. instead of worrying about someone jumping you or pushing your car out of a stall so someone can get to the front of your car this is great. A ust have.
5,drivable,"I believe this is the same charger they store on west coast Auto Club trucks. If so, this charger is so serious that I have even used it as a third battery. My VW camper, which the good lord loves endlessly, often has short circuits or glitches. I run a 2000 watt inverter off of two dry cell batteries, but there's always something going wrong with such an old and heavily customized vehicle. My 4 cylinder engine has literally driven home by leaving the 660 charger attached so that the electricity wouldn't shut off every time I used the turn signals, power steering, headlights etc. Crazy or stupid be this scenario, this jumper got me through it!"
3,jump n carry,This item was purchased to be used at car auctions to jump start vehicles that won't start. It only jumps 2 or 3 vehicles then the battery goes dead. The specifications said that it would jump start more than 3 vehicles.
3,why no charging cable and grip caps?,"just opened the box.why no charging cable? can not use it out-of-box.Do not know where to buy such non-standard stuff?and why white plastic grip caps are missing,which shown in online picture and user manual?but shipping is very fast."
1,This is not what he wanted and we are unable to return it,"This product is not what my husband wanted and we want to return it to buy the same name brand but it has an air compressor with it. I was not told when I ordered this product that this was not returnable. Please email and let me know what we can do. We would like to purchase the other one if we can return this one. Thank you,V/RHelen Frye-Lewis"
2,It failed me when I need it the most,"GoSolar! - 42W Portable Folding Solar Charger Kit - Charge Laptops, Phones & Batteries - Includes Li-Ion Battery, Jumper Cables, DC Inverter and 42 Watt Folding Panel - By California Solar AccessoriesAfter testing it for three jump starts I was impressed by the Clore Automotive JNC000 1700 Peak amp 12-Volt Jump starters. However it was useless when used on a relatively warm winter day to jump the car. That was the day I was going to Hillside Honda to receive yet another free new battery. Now it sits next to my bookcase as a reminder that I've yet purchased another item that has outlived its usefulness."
5,"Takes a ""lickin and keeps tickin""","I carry this unit in my service truck for small and large farm tractors. It gets banged around ,dropped, even has a cracked case now but still has never failed to start a piece of equipment. Starts diesels in winter even after using glow plugs. The only drawback is no on/off switch and when using it in tight areas of equipment to get to the battery I have occasionally done a little ""welding"" but it is still the best booster I've ever used."
5,Works great,"For home use it works great, easy to use and very portable. I bought for my husband for a gift and it has come in handy a few times already."
5,high dollar but top drawer...............,It's one thing to spend a lot of money for a product and not get what you pay for but that is not the case with this product ; This is quality and value at its best.
3,Plenty of power and holds a charge well,"No on off switch. Hard to use and have to be careful, Service was fine and arrived as stated, would look for something different next time."
4,Kind of worked for me,"I used this jumper twice. Once with my wife's car, temp was 30 degrees F, and it was not able to jump her car. Her car battery was old and her battery likely was very weak. Today, my car wouldn't start in zero degree weather, so I jumped it with this and it worked like a charm. My car battery is about 4 years old, but I will be buying a new one today. I'm pleased with the results."
5,Great piece of mind,"I started by looking at some of the cheaper jump starter packs but saw nothing but 1-use reviews. Then I stumbled upon Clore's Jump-n-carry. Nothing but great reviews of people who use it all the time.I tied it into the back of my trunk and have had to use it twice. And guess what, it does a great job! Car turns over and I'm on the road again. Now I don't travel anywhere without it."
3,buyer beware,"#1 YOU CAN not RETURN THIS ITEM TO Amazon. #2 it must be charged up for a full week, not overnight like they say."
5,"Awesome product, coudn't recommend more!","Have been using this for over a couple of months now and as the title says am a satisfied customer and will recommend the product to anyone.My car battery started acting up on me after I came back from a month long international trip, I got stuck twice in the morning to work and once from work late in the night. It was frustrating and painful. Hence I decided to buy this product and boy it saved me like 5-8 times already, it came in fully charged and I haven't charged it yet after receiving it. Jump started my car every time on the first attempt and with no issues what so ever.I finally figured out the problem with the car battery to a iPhone car charger/radio kit connected to the car. Haven't had the need to use it in the last two weeks, but I know it will not fail me if I need it.I think the shipping and delivery was un-eventful so that good.Thanks, hope some one finds the review useful, I spent a full 10 mins writing it :)"
3,"Worked fine, Cables Need to be Longer","Three weeks after purchasing this item I had to use it twice, without a recharge, to start a car with a dead battery. It worked great. The car fired right up both times, and this was after being in the trunk for three weeks when temperatures exceeded 100 degrees most days. I like that there is no special cord or ""brick"" needed to recharge it. You just need an extension cord. My complaint is that the cables are short and even with a small car (Ford Focus) you can't leave the unit on the ground. You have to find a place to prop it up in the engine compartment while you start the car. Fortunately, I was able to do this. After realizing the potential problem I tried it on another car and found it was not possible for my wife to position the device safely by herself. So I am giving it 3 stars since she would not be able to use it if she did not have someone else with her due to the short length of the cables."
5,great product,I've owned a couple of inexpensive jump starters before and they really did not work well. This Clore 660($126) works beautifully....on 3 occasions my boat would not start becasuse of the live well and graphs running for several hours while fishing. I hooked up the clore and boat started immediately. I won't leave the dock without it!!!!!
3,Not as good as reviews,"Positive: Yes it has a meter that tells you charge level.Cables are ""beefy"".Negatives: No LED that shows whether unit is receiving power and is charging.No power cable to plug in wall, extension cord required.Does NOT appear to be that much better or larger charging capacity than Walmart unit costing at least $50 less."
5,Easy & Dependable,"Works great! A girls always gotta be prepared, and this charger is easy to use, and compact enough to carry and keep at the ready in your car. No more waiting for AAA, or stressing that it's a 'Stalker' that stops to help :=) (apologies to all the NON-Stalkers who stop to help a damsel in distress) Hey, You can't be too careful,,,or too well prepared ;=)"
4,Worked great,I used this for the first time about a week after I received it. I bought it because I live in Arizona and the summer heat here tends to kill batteries in a hurry. I am hoping the battery inside this one can survive the heat sitting in my truck. I have not charged it yet. The device came with a charge already so I just put it in my truck. It came in handy to jump a mini cooper that had a dead battery. The car started right up with no waiting so it works as expected. I had to hold the device which is quite heavy because I could not find a good place to rest it under the hood of the mini-cooper. The car started quickly so holding was not an issue. The device made me the hero for about 5 minutes. It was worth the money not to have to make hook ups between vehicles and have to wait for the dead battery to charge a little.I will see how it handles the heat. Should not be any worse that a regular lead acid battery in the Arizona heat.
4,good jump box,"Have used several other cheaper boxes and they just compare to the reliability and strength of this unit.This is used daily at our shop. And it always does the job,very pleased."
4,Jump and Carry,"My husband wanted one of the these to take on his boat for the what if times out on the lake. Have not needed it yet, but feel it is a great product."
4,OK so far,I haven't had much of a chance to test it but it's well built and it's kept it's charge since I bought it. Started my Caravan once from right dead and it was just like having a fully charged battery. Plan on using it on big trucks that I deliver so I'll add to this when I get a chance to use it more.
2,Way too heavy - definitely not for transporting in car.,"I have not used it. Had buyers remorse and THEN found out that I could not return it per Amazon policies - even though it was as shipped to me, in the box, never been charged up. Way too heavy and impractical unless you have your own shop or many cars and want to keep it in your garage."
4,One Powerful Jumpstarter,"This is the most powerful jumpstarter for the money, If you have a big V-8 and need those extra Amps to get your car started when there is very cold weather or your battery is low, this baby is your answer. The rest of the auto parts stores jumpstarters are for kiddy cars and this one really works on tuff jobs."
5,Jump start,"Excellent product, far better than the ones at the home improvement stores. Works every time and holds a charge a long time."
5,Seems sturdy,I have not had to use this yet. Seems sturdy. Carry it when I travel. Seems like it was charged when it got here. Checked it twice now -- once after being in the cold for a couple of weeks -- same charge level showed. Hope it works if I need it to work.
4,Bacon wrapped scallops,"The scallops were ok,but not JUMBO...more like mediums sized,but tasty none the lessFrom the description,we expected huge scallops...instead,they were average.Woul not order again!"
1,You should include cooking directions in the description,"Cooking directions should be included with the description. These are ""pan fry only."" I thought they could be baked. I ASSUMED, which was wrong. I'm giving these to the neighbor."
5,Searching for a star,"Zeffirelli's autobiography was truly fascinating. I became ennamored of the man, even though I don't think he is the best movie director of the 20th century, he is surpassed by Antonioni, Pasolini, Fellini and Vitorio Gassman, but I did enjoy the movies he made. His book gives us not only a vision of what was Italy during the WWII, but also what is the world of creating theater, operas and movies. He does not succumb to the temptation of gossiping about famous people who were close to him and treats all of them with a lot of compassion and understanding. It is a very well written book, I read it very fast and was sorry when it was over."
4,Great read with a history lesson thrown in!,"I love Scottoline's characters. The story moved quickly and held together to the end. In this book, there's the added bonus of the history lesson. I had never thought about any group other than the Japanese being interned during WWII so reading a little of the history of the Italian experience at Fort Missoula was very interesting."
2,Don't waste your time...,I was looking for a new author but I don't know if Scottoline is it. I got to page 182 and dumped this one. Too much history and not enough intrigue!
1,First and Last,This the first of Ms. Scottoline's books I have read and it will most likely be the last. Poor writing and a totally implausable plot had me shaking my head. With so many good thriller writers out there I can't see myself giving this one a second try.
2,"Interesting history, but. . .","It might be good if Ms. Scottoline sticks to history or the law, then uses a ghostwriter. Her discussion of the treatment of Italian-Americans is very good; her treatment of the protagonist is poor. The protagonist is a genius in one sentence, then a dolt in the next; not a believable character. The plot deserves a 10, the history deserves an 8, the legal writing deserves a 7, the writing deserves to be forgotten."
2,Not Scottoline's best effort,"I am an avid fan of Lisa Scottoline's novels. I usually read her books within a day or two of publication. However, this book was not nearly as compelling a read as previous books. I could take it or leave it--not becoming very involved in the story line.Very little of the book concerns the ""girls"" at the firm. I missed the ""lawyering"" that takes place in the other books.If you've not read Scottoline before, don't pick this one as your first."
2,Couldn't even finish it,"I've read a few of Lisa Scottoline's books (Look Again, Legal Tender) and found them to be good reads. I thought this one was so bad, I couldn't even finish reading it. I kept waiting for something significant to happen or what the end game was going to be and it just never happened. Didn't seem to have any point at all."
3,Loves Philadephia and Her Italian Heritage,"This is a fairly entertaining read, but it could have been more suspenseful and with more action. A little too chatty at times, annoyingly so.Still, overall I enjoyed it. My first Lisa Scottoline novel. I'd be willing to try another. She certainly loves her native Philadeplhia and that comes through as does her pride in her Italian-American heritage. I really learned something new about Italians being interned in World War II, something I didn't know before. The historical storyline is very interesting and a departure from most thrillers. The book is well researched and accurate.Overall, a good read but not a spectacular one.James A. Anderson,Author, DEADLINE"
4,One for the Good Guys/Gals,"I thought the story line was great. Introducing Italian immigrants, connecting with early homeland security, mysterious drawings, twists of plot, and a happy ending all made the book enjoyable. And who doesn't like a victorious courtroom drama? The author has an easy way with descriptions and adding humor in clever quips. The drawback of this book was the main character, Mary. Mary - so socially inept, engaging in stupid and dangerous stunts, and breaking the law through her impetuous activities detracted from a good plot. If the heroine were not so bumbling, I would give this book a five. I would still recommend the book for a good entertaining read."
5,One of Scottoline's Best!,"Scottoline always excels at characterization and dialogue, much of it witty. She's in top form here; and in addition to these strengths, I found this one of her best plots. A real page-turner, in which I didn't guess any of the intended surprises."
2,Eeek! Yikes! Argh! Eeeek!!!!,"These are a few of the commonplace expressions of the supposedly mature, educated, intelligent female protagonists of the author's series of books about an all-women law firm in Philly. The problem is, it's not an all-women firm: it's a girly firm with actions, dialogue and clothing more appropriate to an eighth-grade clique than to college-educated, seasoned professional women. Despite the occasional interesting plotlines and background, I can never get past how silly these people are and how they never seem to grow past their eeks and yikes. Come on, Ms. Scottoline: stop dumbing down your characters and raise them to an acceptably mature level - it's way past time for that."
3,"A young lawyer, death, danger, love and friendship","A young Philadelphia lawyer refuses to turn her back on an investigation involving an Italian man in an internment camp in Montana back during World War II. When the investigation runs into a seemingly dead end, when the money and the support for the investigation disappear, when everyone around Mary Dinunzio pleads with her to quit, she is unable to do so. She feels a moral responsibility to a man she never knew and continues to piece things together. Was his death an accident, a suicide or was it a murder? Things take an ugly turn when she turns up the heat on her investigation, and people start getting hurt. An intriguing tale of an immigrant making his way in his new country becomes a critical aspect of her investigation.Meanwhile, as Mary is stepping on some dangerous toes, those around her can only think about her lack of a lovelife!This is an interesting mix of history, romance, danger and friendship."
3,She's done better,"I have read all of Lisa Scottoline's books and naturally was looking forward to this one. Usually I can't put them down, but this one (although the historical background is interesting) is VERY slow moving to me. I pick it up and just as easily put it down. I think the narrative could have been told in few pages and maybe the effect would have been the production of a better book. I will keep reading her stories, but would not highly recommend this one especially to an individual who has never read one of her books before."
2,Good story line but ...,"This is the first time I read a book by Lisa Scottoline. The story is very interesting about a lawyer obsessed with a murder case in the past.However, I found it very unreal to have a practicing lawyer who would break the law to remove evidence from a crime scene, and so easily trust some reporter and spill her guts."
4,Smart and sassy,"Attorney Mary DiNunzio becomes obsessed with an old case involving a WW2 internee, Amadeo Brandolini, who apparently suicided in the internment camp following the death of his wife.A trail of clues leads to the involvement of the descendants of one of Amadeos' fellow internees, Giovanni Saracone and the murder of the attorney whose firm dealt with the Brandolini estate, inexorably points to dirty work at the crossroads! Soon Mary is so involved with the case that her life is threatened and she is actually kidnapped in an attempt to silence her.It's a slick, pacy story- very modern- with a very likeable heroine who battle on, even while admitting that she's really a great sook at heart!"
2,Award winning best selling author???,"What are publishers thinking? Do they use editors at all? The writing in this book is so bad I had to laugh out loud. Not only were we told when someone was shouting, HIS WORDS WERE ALL IN CAPS. And sound effects. Honk, honk, honk, the author writes before telling us that a car is sounding its horn. Kick, kick, kick (you guessed it, someone kicking at something). Rriing, rriing, rriing (Oh, a phone is ringing. Crak, crak, crak (gun fire). But wait, crak, crak is also the sound of a judge's gavel pounding. I couldn't get past a few chapters of this absurd novel."
5,Very nice cover !,This is a heavy duty cover that keeps my grill from being damaged from the outdoor elements ! Large enough to cover it completely
5,bbq cover,"I ordered this cover for our grill. Got it yesterday and it fit perfect. Love the color, texture of material, and elastic fit around the bottom. We had one similar to this for 3 years and it worked out great."
5,Exactly what I needed,This is the 2nd time I've purchased from this seller. All went well. Would buy from again.
4,Very good BBQ cover,Good material. Stitching appears solid. Fits well. Looks good and has adjustable bottom for tight fit. Longevity to be determined.
3,"Great cover, except....","The cover is a decent cover for the price, however, after having only 5 weeks the cover faded terribly. It is now two different colors. Along the bottom where the sun doesn't get it all the time, its fine, but the whole top is terrible. Just a buyer beware!"
5,Perfect cover,The Terrazzo Cart BBQ Cover was exactly what was needed for the grill. It is easy to use and has visual aids for the corners of the grill.
2,I expected better quality for the price,"The cover functions ok, with dimensions correctly advertised to fit my BBQ cart and adequate material to resist the rain. The stictched seams however were poorly sewn and don't expect this cover to last more than 1 year. I was expecting better workmanship for the price."
2,Doesn't fit,"This cover (size medium) is supposed to fit a BBQ up to 60"" wide. Well mine is 60"" exactly and this cover only covered the top half of the BBQ. The bottom half of the BBQ was left completely uncovered and exposed. Sending it back for a refund."
2,Too short,"It was difficult to find a large enough grill cover, so while this was wide enough, it didn't cover the entire height of the grill."
4,Terrazzo BBQ cover,This is a great cover. It is easy to put on and take off and appears sturdy enough to last for years
1,Its bad,the plug that actually goes into the Zune hole is badly designed it almost broke it. while the original one is perfect and now way you can plug it the wrong way this one is rather ill matching.
2,lens pen,This product was a lens pen not a wall chargeranything with a lens tv smartphoneyou can wipe with this lens penNever received a wall charger for 1.99
5,Textbook,"This is really a nice textbook that you would find in a college book store for your classes. Author describes wet flies: its history, how to tie them, and how to fish with them. I DO recommend author's other publication: Trout Flies. This also describes the depth of fly-tying and how to fish with them."
5,"Wet flies, the forgotten enchanted vial of fly fishing","I get to this book after a discussion in the fly fishing forum which I moderate. In the fly tying section a member started a thread about wets and its effectiveness on fly fishing down here in Chile (South America). So as everyone talks, uploads images of wets and so on I realized that I didn't give this type of fly a chance in my 21 years of fly fishing a river, lake or spring creek. So I came to Amazon and type ""Wets"". The resulting list have in it this one, I pick it up because I've already read other books from the same author and love them.It's a superb book, not only because it teach you how to tie this flies, it also teach you how to fish them!A pleasure to read, lots of insight in Dave Huges own experience."
5,All Flyfishers should have this book,"One of the most useful books a flyfisherperson can have. Outstanding information and advice on tying flies that will be useful and how, when and why to fish them. Covers softhackles, flymphs, nymphs and winged wets. Simply a great read even if you do not intend to fish many wet flies. Highly recommended."
5,Oustanding!,"I have been seeking information about optical switching and felt this to be one of the most informative books available. It is easy to understand for beginners and experts who work in a networking environment. I recomend this book to everyone who works in networking, and anyone who may have interest in networking.Senior Telephony Analyst FirstUSA"
2,Poorly written and organized,"This book is poorly written and hard to follow. While the author manages to fill a few hundred pages, his writing is highly repetitive and his organization is largely incoherent."
2,"Not a clearly written book, for light reading","The purpose of my purchasing this book was to learn about the market place and the available technologies for optical switching; it did not serve my purpose. BTW, I am not an optical networking engineer. [...]. The writing and the organization of the book at times is almost incoherent."
3,Forest Fires: Behaviour and Ecological Effects,"The book is aimed to bridge a gap between researcher and applied management. The covers a wide range of topics from fire combustion, to fuel moisture dynamics, the interaction between fire and its surrounding atmosphere, lightning ignition, fire effects and fire management. The chapters for each of these adequately deal with the topic, sometimes at a level which will beyond most people's ken. The book is missing a level of integration within and between chapters, which makes it difficult to appreciate the book's comprehensive nature. It would have been nice to have an overarching framework on fire behaviour and ecological effects to direct the writers of each chapter towards a central understanding of fires and their ecological effects. The book does cover fires and their effects in both northern and southern hemispheres. Some of the figures could have benefitted from being in colour."
1,Do not buy the Amazon Version - it is different from the original,I recently discovered that this book is supposed to have COLOR picture plates in the center to illustrate the fire effects. The book I received from Amazon has black and white pictures. They have given no indication that they are selling a modified version of the book. The black and white picture are reasonable quality but in no way show what was intended with the color ones. Amazon charges the same price as versions with the color plates.DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. Go somewhere where you can verify that the picture plates in the center are supposed to be color.
5,A wonderful teaching resource!,"I have to say first off that I do not own this book *yet*. However, I have looked at it often and will buy it when I can. Because it looks to be an amazing way to dive head first into the Little House books.Most subjects are covered - math, science, reading, history, and more. I believe that anyone living on the Great Plains would be well advised to use this for at least one year of home schooling to learn more about the region.With this book you really can't push the grade or age. My DD is advanced for her age and I know I have to wait to use this. It would mean a lot of work to adapt it down in age."
1,Waste,"RIDING HIS PREVIOUS COATAILS INTO OBLIVION ...ONCE HE WAS GOOD, AND THEN HE JUST GOT WORSE AND WORSE .PROiSE IS REALY DEAD. THIS BOOK IS LEADEN .ITS CURSED.

3,"Good product, Wrong info/picture...","I was happy to see the package arrive at my front door after the week and a half wait, what I expected, and hastily opened the box to find that it was ""almost"" what I was hoping for. I really enjoyed the series and was looking forward to what was pictured on the Top Swords site. To my dismay, it wasn't exactly what it looked like. The blade didn't have the anodized area on it like in the picture! That was the biggest selling point to me. One other point of interest I found was that the weight on the shipping box said 9 pounds. The weight specified by the seller was 20 pounds! That tells me that there is some ""fudging"" on the correct weight which doesn't look good to a perspective buyer. But, nonetheless, I like the ""feel"" of the sword and will put it to good use in the upcoming anime convention."
5,Great Product,"This was a great product. It was delivered in a timely fashion, and in excellent condition."
3,Sweet...but not perfect,"As a butterfly knife collector, this was a must have. Overall I am happy with it. The blade is sharp and it is sturdy. However, the overall blade quality is average and there are some scuff marks near the top edge that may or may not come out with some elbow grease.The workmanship of the handle wood inlays is somewhat poor and the wood looks kind of lackluster. I was expecting some nice looking wood, but it looks like something I could buy off the shelf at a hardware store.However, that being said who can not like a 37 inch butterfly sword. The shear size and awesomeness of it can make you overlook its imperfections."
5,this is cool,this sword is worth the buy. even though it wieghs about 10LBs. and almost impossible to actually get a few good swings in fight...though one swing might be good enough unless the person has metal in them. this is very sharp mayne n so friggin cool. i took an orange and apple n through em in the air n cut clean straight through the both ( not at the same time lets be real) but yea . a stand does come free with it jus for show no biggie and the clip to keep it close really doesnt work while open but who cares if u are using it to damage some one u'll be holding it by the wood which wil keep it close any way n the weight of it doesnt really allow the handles to go flyin about the place so despite that fact its still friggin cool i'll up load a video maybe 2nite or 2moro
5,Great Book,This book was in great shape. The only problem I had with this order was that I paid for expedited shipping and it seemed to take a much longer time to reach me. Other than that the book was a really great deal.
3,If you like Horror then read this,Spike is the cutest guy in school and everyone has been hearing a lot of things about him.... like every girl that has gone out with him never was saw again! Sarah the girl that likes him keeps hearing the rumor and ignores them.... she thiks that they're all lies. When she goes out with him she finally findes out that all the rumors were true.
4,Fun for all!,This is the best present that my 4 year old daughter received. She hasn't stopped playing with it since Christmas. Even my 9 month old son giggles when the songs are played (and the lights are flashing). The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars...there are two things I can find wrong with it are 1) the microphone doesn't seem to have a long life. It seems that it's already dead 2)I haven't been able to find additional song cartridges. (I like variety!) But it's a great overall buy!
2,Didn't make the grade,"Well, we didn't expect a whole lot of quality for under $40, but generally this was a disappointing toy for my musical 5-yr old. The mic volume seemed to give up after a day, and the keys not delivering much of a true sound (more isn't always better). The pre-loaded songs on the cartridge quite cute, as was the echo effect for the mic."
3,Piccolo Pen,"I purchased this pen and the ink in it would not write clearly, as it skipped. However, everytime I touched it, there would be ink on the pen and on my fingers. Then, I put in the included ink refill and it worked great, but now I am finding more ink on the pen and on my fingers. It is a great pen to carry as it does not take up much room. Hopefully, I will be able to find ink refills for the pen. So overall the pen is okay, but I could have lived without it."
5,Rare Treasure from Ella Fitzgerald,"I was driving across central Illinois more than 5 years ago. A weak signal from some college radio station keeping me company. Straight ahead jazz with very little commentary from a disc jockey. I heard the first lady of song belting out a novelty number I had never known before and I thought I had everything she recorded. Silly fake Spanglish accent. I talked to other Ella fans. I talked to record store clerks. I searched music web sites and found nothing. Finally this afternoon I spent some time on google and there it was on a movie sound track. ""Stone Dead in the Market"" Google says this album is going for ten times this price in Europe. I think it is worth just for the Ella."
2,This won an Award?,"How did this win a Best production Award? In todays world of hi tech audio, this was sadly lacking in production. The actors sound like they are sitting on stools reading into a microphone. There is no feeling of action or excitement. It is a dull reading with music that sounds as if it was taken from a record, and not designed for this production. When compared with the Sherlock Holmes I hear on XM - this production falls flat, and was a disappointment."
2,SKIP DISC 5,"The theatrical productions of the stories by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle are entertaining, but I suggest that you don't waste any time on the piece by Yuri Rasovsky. The logic is flawed, the dialogue is trite, and the humor is flat. It would be a terrible play even if the characters were new, but it's even worse as a Sherlock Holmes story since the actions are entirely out-of-character both for Holmes and for Dr. Watson.I'd give 4 stars to this item if it only contained the first four discs. Disc Five eroded my enthusiasm to the point that now I can only muster a 2-star rating overall."
3,Not as good as expected,"I found this book to be somehow lacking, despite the fact that it has apparently won one or more awards.It sort of meandered along with the main character stumbling into plot connections, which perhaps reflects the Gallic and Italian flair referred to in a review clip from The Guardian.''An iconoclastic chronicle of small-time crooks and desperate capers, with added Gallic and Italian flair. Wonderful fun.'' The GuardianHowever, this stumbling just didn't have a realistic feel to it and perhaps that is why the novel leaves me with a ""meh"" feeling."
2,not safe,this switch uses very 1970's technology of interrupting the wire itself to shut off and then to reconnect. stuff like this is a fire hazard and I wouldn't recommend it.
1,A waste of money!,"I had high expectations for such an expensive pillow, and boy was I let down in a big way. I fitted it with a high thread count pillowcase and was ready to get a peaceful night's sleep only to discover that once pressure is applied to the pillow (by the head, arms, or hands) it gets flat as a pancake. Oh, it springs back when no weight is on it, but what good is that? Support? What support? No support! This ranks as zero stars for me."
3,"comfy, but too thin","This pillow seems good for price, but i ended up using it to prop or folded in half to double the thickness. It is only 2 or 3"" thick.."
5,Great Party Book,"This book has everything you need to plan a Halloween party. It's more focused for children, but it also had quite a few ideas suitable for adults.I think it's the only book you'll need to plan a fun Halloween party.This books has great ideas for indoor and outdoor decorations. It also has wonderfully creative recipes. There are plenty of games to keep party guests entertained. From very fun and noisy games to the settling down and quiet games. In addition to the quiet games, there are neat craft projects to do."
4,Helpful,"I bought this book last year for help with a child's halloween party. There are plenty of games for all ages and the recipes are easy to prepare. The only disappointment for me with this book is all the photo's and recipes are in black and white which doesn't really give a good idea of what the costumes and receipes will look like. Color photo's would have been so much better, but if your looking for games for all ages this is the book for you."
4,Great spooky ideas for the whole family.,I recently bought this book online. Since receiving it I have looked at it often and there are lots of great ideas in it. There are some great decorating tips that are easy to understand and the treats are really easy to make and taste good. If you want your family to have a SPOOKY Halloween with all the tricks and treats then you would really enjoy this book.
2,Not that great,"I ordered this book because it got so many stars and such great reviews. It is a good formatted book, easy to read, but a little juvenile. If you are used to planning larger, adult parties, this book is not for you. This is more for kids or children's parties. The food items are very juvenile and the party decorations are for parties that don't scare the audience that much. If you like to shock or scare you partygoers, Martha Stewart probably has more scary ideas than this."
2,slightly disappointing,"I had much higher expectations for this book based on other reviews I had read. Everything in this book I had already found on-line, for free. Kind of disappointing, but I'll pass it on to someone with kids for party planning."
4,Good Halloween information,This is a good starter book for anyone wanting to liven up Halloween parties!
5,Excellent Tool - how to help others,"This is fine resource & most people will find helpful hints & ideas to help their friends deal with the loss of a love one. Written in such a way which it can benefit those who lose a loved one or those who want to aid someone who has lost someone, it is easy to read & organized so it can be read from cover to cover or just pick up a chapter for a quick read."
3,"Decent, but not great!","Feehan is not the best writer in this genre, and the editing of her books is awful (typos just about every page). Feehan uses pages of writing to try to convey what could be achieved more elegantly with just a few better-crafted sentences.She at least tries to build the heroine's love for the Carpathian gradually, instead of the instant commitment so common in this genre, but doesn't really succeed very well. In addition to fighting vampires, there is a human man competing for the girl's attentions -- but that storyline is never resolved, just left hanging.There's nothing unique or terribly interesting about this episode in the Dark Carpathian series. And there are other books in that series that are markedly better. But if you want to be thorough, go ahead and read it. It does add details to Gregori's storyline. Though I found it disorienting that apparently 18 years have passed since Book #2, Dark Desire, where Gregori's story was set up...."
4,Another Carpathian bites the dust,"If you like Christine Feehan and the Carpathian series, you will like this book. It is her typical, rich style of erotic writing with a dominate Carpathian male subdued by a woman who is to be his life mate. The usual premise with a different story line. I almost put this one down at first. It has a very brutal start involving a child and it took pages before the central characters connected. Once they did, I was relieved to sit back to enjoy the story. Some of these drag on and on a bit through the erotic scenes and I get impatient. However, I imagine some readers like this part best so I compromise move through these parts quickly. The author is a good writer and despite the violence of the vampire hunt, there is also some humor in the banter between the life mates. This is a popular series and if you are new to it you will be pleased to know that you will have many more books to read. Enjoy."
2,"endless, mindless etc","I like Christine Feehan's writing - some of it. This is the first of the Dark series I have read and if the rest are like it, forget about it. I'm about ready to take Alexandria's head and give it a good shake. I mean really... this chick understands nothing. The entire book is her not listening, not understanding, not having a clue. AAARRRGGGGhhhh. Christine can do a lot better than this!"
4,dark and delightful,"Another enjoyable read from Christine Feehan. I liked her newest heroine, Alexandria, somewhat different from the others.I have devoured all of her books and look forward to any and all books written by Christine Feehan. While not my all time favorite it still was a very good read."
1,"See the Narrater review for ""Dark Magic""","I'm sorry there's no way to rate in minus stars. Juanita Parker makes this book memorable by ruining the admittedly Feehan-unique text. Her voice is acceptable, her inability to pronounce English words, never mind the bits of French or Italian Feehan drops here and there, is not."
4,Dark Gold - 24 karat,"Dark Gold, the third in the Carpathian saga, was a wonderful book. This one is a bit gory at times, but well worth reading. I can definately sympathize with the feelings of Alex. Read this book and you'll fall in love with Aiden, too."
2,Disappointed,"I looooove paranormal romance. I've read hundreds! But, for some reason I had never heard of Christine Feehan. One day, I decided to do a search of the top authors in paranormal romance and came across her name. I was surprised and excited to see the long list of books in this series. Lots of reading material! I got the first book and drudged through, thinking that books written early in an author's career are not as good as what will come and i was just getting the scenery and back stories of the next great books... and the second one in this series was an improvement to be sure, but still lacking, so I had hopes.... I am now in the middle of this third book in the series and I am so bored to tears, I can't stand it! Can we please get away from women in these books not having control of their bodies so that they are essentially forced into sexual encounters? What the F????"
4,dark gold,enjoy the whole story line books are fairly fast paste to make for fast reading witch is gd because there are 20 or 25 books
5,Dark Gold,This is the second time I read this book and enjoyed it a second time as well. I always like the fighting/action parts of her stories.
3,Nice if you want a quick read,"I liked this book better than others in the Dark series. The main characters seem to have a slightly more equal relationship and Adain is a nicer character in the beginning as opposed to the deceptive, half rapists that appear in the previous books, which practically force the woman into sex then hurt her in the process. Overall these books are all the same story line so far; man about to turn evil, meets a woman who rejects him, he forces her into submission , the woman falls in love, there is a brief excitement when a nemesis attacks and they must protect the woman, then everyone lives happily. Its a nice read when you want something light and quick, although the plots grow boring in each successive book."
1,The worst author I've read in years....seriously,"I wish I could give this no stars. I don't know how people can enjoy this woman. This is by far one of the worst published authors for this genre of books, I've ever had the displeasure of reading. I've read only two of her books (the second one, was just to give her another chance) and they were just horrendous.It's the most repetitive, ridiculous, unbelievable cheesy dialogue imaginable. It's almost insulting to the reader how horribly vapid the writing is. I thought I was reading a Ann Rice-wannabe/Harlequinn Romance hybrid abomination.I just can't even express how awful this author is."
2,Annoying Heroine,"Both the main character and the plot were pretty disappointing. Particularly the author's clear lack of understanding of any of the things it takes for a person to support herself as an artist (let alone her little brother, who appears to be merely a plot device, instead of a character). Now she's going to be a game designer? She got this interview how? But I digress.The love story was forced, the girl was much too perfect, and for crying out loud, if she's going to be an artist, you could have the decency to give her a day job and some paint under her fingernails like the real thing. Also, what is with the totally generic mansion? They need a ballroom why? Is pretentious consumerism somehow wired into the Carpathian mindset?"
2,Boring and repetitive,I swear I just read this exact plot in the second of Ms. Feehan's series. A little innovation would have been appreciated.
2,"Same old, same old","Maybe my problem is that I read this after reading almost all the other Dark books, but I was very bored by this carbon copy story. Alexandria is hysterical through the first 3/4 of the book. Aidan seems like the nicest guy in the world and I get soooo tired of her resistance. I finally stopped reading this at page 299 and have not regretted my decision. My favorite books in the Dark series are 'Dark Fire', 'Dark Magic', 'Dark Legend', and 'Dark Celebration'."
3,More about relationships,"This one (#3 in the series) is more about getting to know and appreciate someone than about wild sex, which often seemed to be the only glue holding the couples together in some of the other books. In fact, nothing sexual happens for 2/3 of the book; instead Aidan and Alex get to know each other, making it realistic and romantic and sweet.I also liked the fact that Aidan had humans who took care of him, who shared his life and his secret. It made him more vulnerable, more approachable. This is my favorite of the first 4 books in the series. Sometimes ratings are so hard. This one should be a 3 & 1/2 star rating."
4,Sensuous,"This was the third book I read, after Dark Fire and Dark Desire, obviously I'm not reading it in the right order. I thought Fire was best overall, and Gold was good because Aidan was a really sexy hero. But it seemed incomplete, for eg, I thought there was a lead-up to something sinister happening with the Ivan character but nothing came out of it and he just disappeared from the story. But bringing in Gregori was good, because it showed his darkness and his power, preparing us for his story in Dark Magic, which I hope to read soon, along with Dark Prince. Maybe Ms Feehan could write longer books so that the stories can work themselves out better? And I could have a longer read too!"
5,GOOD READ,"IT WAS A GOOD STORY, BUT I EXPECTED MORE. IT FELT LIKE CERTAIN THINGS WERE LEFT OUT. OVERALL GOOD, I COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN. I JUST HOPE DARK MAGIC MEETS MY EXPECTATION. I HAVE READ ALL THE BOOKS SO FAR AND AND THEY WERE GOOD. A WRITER WHO IS VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT HER CHARACTERS AND THEY WAY THEY FEEL FOR EACH OTHER."
4,Dark Gold from The Bookdragon Review,"""Feehan once again provides a book that stands well on its own, but is infinitely stronger with its companion novels. The ""lightness"" of Dark Gold takes some adjustment after the emotional thunderstorm of Dark Desire, but Gregori pops in on the trail of his erstwhile lifemate, showing Dark Gold takes place approximately twenty years after Dark Desire. Feehan's books are a treat for the jaded paranormal fan, and luckily, there are many more ahead.""Excerpt reprinted from The Bookdragon Review."
2,I have to agree,"I have to agree with most of the others who have written reviews on this book. I LOVED the first two in the ""Dark"" series. But i couldn't even finish this one, i'm jumping ahead to Gregori's story. I absolutely hated Alex. Just like everyone else was saying, she was snobbish, and selfish. I kept reading, hoping she'd get over her ""hysterical"" period and finally LISTEN to Aidian about what she'd become, but she kept pushing him away, and being what i thought was really closeminded about the whole thing. I couldn't stand her to the point where i was reading with my teeth gritted, so i just put the book down. i'll keep reading the rest of the series b/c i adored the first two. I just hope the rest to come are far better than this one."
1,Not Great at All,"I basically felt this book was force. I was forced to believe that these two would fall in love, but with the whole Carpathian lifemate thing working and the ability to mind read, you don't ever get the chance to listen to the characters share their fillings, their past or their fears. Since they automatically know each other. I felt I didn't know anything about either character and this made it even harder for me to enjoy the book. Anything about them was a blip compared the physical attraction they had for each other and then to top it off the sex scenes were often quick and annoying fix its to the story with Aiden Savage asking for more afterwards."
5,Dark Gold,"The main character was complex, very strong minded, but willing to eventually learn and change for another. This book is for mature aurdiences as there are some mature scenes included."
5,CONCISE marketing information on Q&A format !!!!!!!!!!!,This is a very good book in all areas of marketing in a Q&A format by a guru in the subject. I recommend it !!!!!!!
4,A Review of Invitation to Christian Spirituality,"I found the book to informative, and well researched. I would perhaps sugest the author spend a little more time organizing thoughts to help the reader realize when the book is changing reference point. It is written well and interesting, but lets face it; this is a textbook that is used at the seminary level. I need a reference, not a story. P.S. The author is also my Professor here at Houghton College in NY and I do want to say he's an excellent teacher and friend to us all. Good book over all, but I would only suggest it to the diehards out there. This dude is smart! D.C.W."
3,Not bad.,"I am unsure what to say about this product. It hasn't harmed my digestion but I am unsure if it has helped. I have noticed an increased ability to digest high fat foods but only those of non-animal origin. No side effects. I would recommend at least trying it. Just because it wasn't a ""miracle"" for me doesn't mean it might not work well for you."
1,Thought it would help and it didn't,Though this would help with indigestion and weight loss because I have gained about 20 pounds over 4 years after gallbaldder removal due to pancreatitus and it really did nether of those. Sitting on top of the fridge collecting dust. Wouldn't reccomend trying it.
2,Very high dose.,"Ox Bile is essential in helping with digestion of fats in older people or in people who have had their gallbladder removed but this dose is very high. I spent the night of the first dose in great pain, throwing up a very strong acid bile that burned my throat and mouth for hours. The diarrhea was just as painful and it took several hours to clear my system. 3 different bouts of vomiting and diarrhea. Just beware if you are a first time use of Ox Bile, to take a smaller dose, start out with 125 mg and work up as needed. I will purchase some empty gelcaps and break down the doses to manageable levels so it is not a waste of money, but it was sure a shock to my system."
2,Very upsetting for me,"I was excited to try this product especially reading that it helps in absorption of foods after having the gallbladder removed.I took these as it said on the label, however, I had some serious adverse reactions to these. They made me sick to my stomach as though I had diarrhea. Perhaps the strength was too strong for me, but I threw these out! Perhaps I will try the one's that are 125mg."
5,What GREAT GAME!,"I recently bought this game for my son, he just turned 9. I would have to say its hard for him to stop playing it, i have played along with him, and i am amazed by this game. It has such good morals, and the graphics are amazing! I would highly suggest this for anyone who want there kids to play a quality game."
5,AWESOME!!!,i got the game for christmas and haven't been able to put it down! I really like roberta! Finally a cool girl character!:) my parents like it because of the e rating.my friend alyssa and i spent almost our entire break playing. Buy this game!!! you won't be disappointed!judy s.
1,STINKY DUMB AND STUPIED,I hate this crap it stinks I returend it becuse of all the time it took to load to play a stupied level stay awya from this game of tare or you might die dum dum dum.
4,I loved this game!,I loved this game it is an excallent brain teaser the costumes and the characters are adorable but sadly the boss characters were not very difficult in this game you play as a knight named Tormund and a sorceress named Roberta they must team up to defeat The Darkest Faerie who has cursed the land of Neopia. Over all I give this game a 4 stars so feel free to try it and enjoy it!
5,BUY THIS GAME!,"Ok i'd like to say a few words, this billy guy, DONT BELIEVE HIM! He's wrong about the animals on Neopia and all that other stuff he says. And someone who says stuff just to make themselves to look like their right and cool get on peoples nerves! DONT LISTEN TO HIM! THIS GAME ROCKS!PS. Billy get some spelling classes!This game rocks!"
5,ANIMALS ROCK....beware......,So billy this is what i got to say...well i should say a bad word but i cant in front of 6 year olds like yourself.

People reading this review(other than Billy and his made up friend Timmy and James) This product is worth your money.P.S.Do your parents know you watch and play rated R movies and Video games?From the teens.
1,Whould be fun if it loaded,I brought this game for my little sister for her brithday and we were sad that it took forever to load.She cried and we took the game back.We hope pet pet adventures will be better.
5,Billy is a RETARDO,"For heavens sake Billy, shut the (....) up! Everyone is against you, and with GOOD reason. Admit it, you're just a dumb first grader who got mad because the game was too difficult for you. I bet you don't even know how to play Shadow the Hedgehog. The right game for you would be something like Elmo World or Bob the Builder. This game is awsome, but it seems you and your fake friends are too immature to see that. Oh, I am sorry little guy, I forgot, you don't know the meaning of such BIG words. Immature... in this case I would say it means that you're a stupid little butt hole with no life and no friends. Bye bye little butt hole! :("
1,Crapyest game ever,Ok this is what your geting.A crapy super childish game for preschoolers.I brought the game and beet it in 2 hours incluiding my lunch.If your under 5 this is a good game for you.Under 5 it's crap.Pros.Short and easyCons.Stupied fighting to much camra problems and stiped fairy and lion.P.S.I am not a member of that stupied billy henderson's cool club.
5,"Love, Love, Love it!","This is absolutely my favorite ""music with nature"" CD. I listen to this when I'm working, eating dinner, reading, or just relaxing. No matter how bad a day I may have, this CD will chill me out and make me feel better. The sounds of the ocean, the birds, even the foghorn are so peaceful and beautiful.HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS!!!"
5,"Of the Dan Gibson CDs I currently have, my 2nd favorite.","While overall it isn't as good as ""Great Lakes Suite,"" my favorite Dan Gibson creation, it is better in some ways. For example, here in ""Atlantic Suite"" the transition between the various pieces of music seems more--pardon the choice of words--*natural.* However, the music itself isn't as good. Still, this is a good CD that merits 5 stars."
2,beware the crumples!,"There are crumpled papers within each pad. This means you never have a flat, smooth, even surface. There are just enough problem pages in each pad to make problems for the whole pad, but not enough that you will give up and just toss the whole pad and order something else. I won't order this item again."
2,The paper is fine; the backing is flimsy,"There is nothing wrong with the paper in these pads, that I've seen -- I tend to use legal pads by flipping back the pages, not tearing them out -- but the problem lies in the lack of any stiffness to the backing cardboard. It is thin and very flexible. If you're writing on a desk, fine. But if you're writing on your knee, or freestanding, you're going to have problems."
2,"Good Price, Decent Paper","This was a good price for all that paper! I use Legal Pads every day in meetings and I was annoyed to discover this paper does not tare very pretty. Other than that, its good paper for what it's worth."
3,Great product...,Lays flat and 100% great product... tears off easy... only thing is the price... I found a pack of double the size... at half the price...
2,Backing: SO BAD!,"The paper is fine. It tears nicely. But, it's nearly useless as far as I'm concerned. Really, why have a backing at all if you're going to make it so flimsy??"
5,"Excellent Quality, exactly what I needed","I use a leather zipper binder that holds a notepad for everyday business use. When I ran out of paper, I came to Amazon to find a replacement and I am extremely happy with my purchase.The price is right, it fits in the notebook, and it is a quality product.Pros:Price (Buy more and save more)Quality - It is nice paper to write onPerforation - Unlike some other reviewers' experiences, I find that the pages are easy to pull out and I have had no tears so far.Cons:As some have mentioned, the cardboard on the back is a bit flimsy. Its not really a factor for me since the paper is being used in a rigid folder.Conclusion:I will order more of this brand when I run out. It is hard to find notepads that fit exactly what you want/need and this is it for me. Recommended"
5,GOOD PRODUCT,"I bought these for use at my job, and find them to be exactly what I needed. It was a good value, and I am happy with the purchase."
4,Its paper?,I needed legal pads for school since spiral notebooks slow down my note taking process. This did the trick. I wish they sold college ruled pads though.
3,product denied at prison,"I am aware that inmates can not receive any stapled product. I looked and read carefully on this product and could not see any mention of staples So now am tryng to get this product returned. in the future would like to see or it be mentioned in product discription that there are staples, metal spirals. thank you the product is tops letr-trim perforated top letter legal pads 7533"
1,Cheap pile of Crap.,"Why buy this DVD player when a squirrel on a generator, hooked to a old 1981 Apple Computer screen wired with coat hangers to a typewriter would be more reliable.I was given this as a gift for Christmas. I used it during road trips and otherwise it was kept locked away in my closet. During the 2nd half of the third road trip, the player stoppped working. NO disk would load. It told me no disk was in the player. I tried a DVD, CD, MP3 Disk, Picture disk...nothing. I called APEX. After sending me thru the most elementary set of problems like unplugging the thing for 30 seconds, trying an unscratched disk (duh), and cleaning it with a laser disk cleaner they said it must be an internal problem. (YA THINK!) The cost of shipping, labor, and maintenance is more than the cost of the player. Thus I'll be sending this pile of crap to the nearest electronics recycling center and buy something with SONY or PHILIPS written across it. Thanks for nothing APEX."
1,Not an isolated incident,"NO DISC... I had a similar problem, only mine was a little more long and drawn out. First off, about a year before it stopped reading discs completely, it just started popping open. It started happening more and more frequently until finally it wouldn't stay closed at all. I dealt with it though. Taped it closed, placed something on the cover, then there were tehe disc errors. I'd turn it off and on 2 or three times before it would play properlly. Then, the 'No Disc' message became permenant. At leas the screen still works. For what it's worth. Don't buy it. Also It won't work without the remote. What a pain in the bum."
2,Not worth the space on your book shelf,"The book is large, heavy and hard to handle while reading. The designs are unfinished, unpolished, and unsophisticated. The images are dark and poor. Being a designer I have numerous books on the subject and was terribly disappointed in this book!!!"
4,Not happy with the seller.,"I love the book. It's absoloutely amazing. However, it was not in the condition that it was claimed it was. I was very dissappointed, because I had purchased it for a gift and I thouht it was new. However, it was pretty worn out and. I had to buy something else, but kept this for myself, cuz the book itself is fantastic."
4,This book was great! And the Saga continues.,"As I was reading the first part of the book, the battles just didn't have the usual punch that I have read in the past. The Clans are so much more Advanced, has the Inner Sphere caught up that quickly? The Trial of Refusal on the Invasion could have been a whole novel in its self. Then came the second half! There was twist after twist that just kept you guessing. A lot of politics were played out, but that is the other half of the whole Battletech Universe, and it left you asking, ""What will happen next?"". Michael Stackpole is definately one of the best when it comes to the Batteltech Universe."
3,Not the best by Mr. Stackpole,"I would tend to agree with the previous reviewer who stated Mr. Stackpole's writing is rather weak in this book, but it isn't his writing as much as the plot. When one reads the ""Warrior"" trilogy or the first three of book about the return of the clans, the plot is very complex with many loosely connected storylines. Mr. Stackpole's last three battletech books are not anywhere near as complex and interesting as his previous works. Is it his writing or is it the maker of the game responsible for this change???"
1,"Horrid, simply Horrid","More and more evidence of total bungling on the part of FASA. I am certainly never going to run any campaigns in the post-3060 universe...way too many unbelivable plot twists, with absolutly no thought given to such ideas as believability."
3,I think Stackpole is getting Sick of 'Tech,"I was always a Stackpole fan. It was his books that started me on the series and his that still make me amazed when I read them. His sheer detail and vivid action scenes should be a watermark for all other writers. But in this, his latest and likely last Battletech book, something is missing. Creativity. His actions scenes, which could have been incredible, are instead canned and unispired. If you want to read a battletech book for the action, look elsewhere. If you want to read about the deep story line of Battletch, then read this book. That it does do."
4,A exciting tornado-paced must-read for any BattleTech fan.,"Michael Stackpole continues to shape the BattleTech universe with this latest tale of falling empires, shifting balances of power, political intrigue, assassination, and galactic warfare. The culmination of a several-year story arc and the Twilight of the Clans series, no BattleTech fan should be without ""Prince of Havoc"" -- and the nail-biting conclusion is guaranteed to leave the reader awestruck."
4,"If you like political intrigue, this book is for you.","As a fan of the Battletech series, I was totally engrossed in this book. While the action was a little hard to follow at times, it was sufficient. What really grabbed me was the intrigue that has become Mr. Stackpole's hallmark in this series. The character development is phenomenal, to the point I take an interest in even minor characters like Curaitis and the assassin. The Byzantine intrigue, snappy dialogue, and rich attention to characters marks this book as a great read."
3,"Interesting, but dull at the same time","The story was good, but aside from wondering what happened since the last book there wasn't much to keep me reading. Their is little combat and it's slow to get to the point. The ending chapters are really good, but the rest of the book is a drag. Anyway Victors sister is really starting to tic me off, he'd better kill her quick.If you want to know what happened since shadows of war, this is a good book, but after the first time, i doubt you'll read it again"
3,Change of the poltical Tide in BattleTech,"I had been eagerly waiting for this book to come out . I was fairly dissappointed with Michael Stackpole's bland discription of Battles at least compared to his other books I have read. This book is still a definite must have, due to the sweeping change in Inner Sphere and Clan Poltics. If you don't pick this one up, Your definitely going to be left wondering ""what happened?"" later in the BattleTech universe. I just wish for once, that Fasa would concentrate a novels focus on one of the other clans (Ghost Bears), instead of The Jade Falcons and Clan Wolf."
3,"Good, but not up to snuff.","This book culminated with a very surprising and well-written turn of events but early on I found it to be tedious. Michael Stackpole is a master at character development and intrigue as apparent in his first (and in my opinion better written) foray into the Twilight of the Clans Series and the second half of this book, but he should really try to minimize the combat scenes in his novels. The battle scenes almost put me to sleep. I felt like I was reading a play-by-play of two guys playing the Battletech board game. It seemed like every laser and missile hit was discussed. Definantely uncalledfor. It had a remarkable second half, once it got into politics and intrigue. The second half of the book deserves 4 stars, the first deserves 2. The average is 3...that's why I gave it that."
4,"Big Fun, Great Graphics, but No Online?","I really enjoy the heck out of this game. The graphics are great & the sounds are great as well. You get a real sense of high speed. The only fault this game has is that when you take it online to Xbox Live, it is IMPOSSIBLE to race against other humans. There is some kind of programming glitch. However, there is still a very good reason to play Powerdrome on Xbox Live; all the racers are unlocked for you to play when you host a race online, even if you have not unlocked them yet in career mode. So I play against the AI, which is good AI anyhow, & I feel I get my money's worth out of the game. The title is so cheap now, nobody seems to own it. I hope they make a new version of Powerdrome for the next-gen consoles, but I really doubt they will. Whatever."
1,bad things.,"was the book supposed to be written like jane austen?i sure hope not. (utter failure)the plot was stretched out over too many pages and interjected with catastrophies. the author appears to have not thought out the plot, at all. that aside-it is readable. until you get to the end, at which you will be infuriated at the further thoughtlessness of the author. a poor attempt at a twisted ending and an ""oh well"" explaination for the resolution.the time period is tampered with to an extreme.do not waste your time."
3,Doesn't quite hit the mark of Aiken's previous triumphs,"I started out thinking I was in for yet another jewel along the lines of ""Jane Fairfax"" and ""Mansfield Revisited."" Aiken certainly starts off in that vein, but halfway thru, the plot turns ridiculous. Hatty became so 'Dickens-like' in her cheerful suffering that I wanted to gag, and the antagonists were also crosses between those found in Bronte and Dickens and not Austen-like at all. Aiken seemed to abandon wit and good humor for pathos and melo-drama. I hope she will not continue on this vein in her future Austen ventures. Aiken is VERY gifted and readable, so it is easy to forgive her for ""The Youngest Miss Ward."""
2,plot distortion,"This book is a sorry disappointment coming from a talented authoress like Miss Aiken. The lpot is not true to Miss Austen at all, and not a whit of it leads to the plot, structure, theme, language or depth of ""Mansfiedl Park"". And like all Janeites out ther, let me point out that the youngest Miss Ward's first name is not Harriet (Hatty); it's actually Frances (Fanny). Our Heroine in ""Mansfield Park"" is Fanny Price, and she is the eldest daughter, and in true Jane Austen fashion, the eldest daughters and sons are usually named for the parents. A disappointemnt indeed, a far cry from what Miss Austen conceptualised."
2,What a let-down!,"I am a long-time Austen fan-though not one of Stephanie Barron, whose footnotes I find endlessly annoying. I found myself wanting to throw this novel away halfway through, when Hatty was being falsely accused of all that nonsense. Blah, blah, blah. I decided to persevere, and found it interesting, though as others remark, too, too Dickensian.But that ending!!! WHAT'S THAT ALL ABOUT? What a let-down! Ending up with Godwit? Pullease! It certainly made Camber look even more an idealistic fool than before. And that letter with the reference to Hatty dying young--why even include that? We all would rather just have her drift away as part of that time period without being forced to contemplate mortality. And why that letter from the present anyway? Takes away all the 18th Century, pre-Regency atmosphere. Unnecessary and stoopid!"
5,ALLURING SCENT!,"ALLURE by CHANEL in one word is really ""alluring"". The scent is feminine and sexy, not the cute floral kind. The smell is hard to describe, it is the type of perfume you can use as a signature scent because it is noticeable ... sweet, mildly spicy and lingers on."
4,"Great stuff, though the bottle looks like it's old","Pros: Genuine Chanel Allure Product, Good priceCons: Seems like an old item still in stock, not really a con though"
3,Can take a beating,"I bought these as a replacement to my old Leki poles. I'm pretty rough with them, and they can take it. My only complaint is with the wrist straps-- these come with a locking mechanism so you can adjust the straps and make them tighter, which is nice for small hands like mine. But, I found that the locking mechanism would come loose when the straps were pulled, and that caused the poles to slip right off my wrists. Not good when you're bushwacking your way across a steep montane forest. I'll probably just superglue the locks down."
3,Roller Derby,"This book is slow and very SAD to be Frank, it tells of the derby as a traveling circus with 2 main stars and a lot of jealous rivals. Great but what is it trying to do. I have been a fan of the derby since the mid 60's and I don't see the real derby anywhere in these pages. It's like the movie derby nothing to do with the derby but the dreams of someone wanting to be a part of the derby, both poor portrayals of the real derby."
2,a year later,"Weight Watchers WW35D Body Fat Glass Electronic ScaleI bought this scale a year ago, and worked great.but then the batteries died, i replaced them and then the scale has been reading 5 pounds over the actual reading. i don't know how to fix it, has this happened to anyone else?i was hopping to balance it somehow but there's no way to do it. and i don't know how to fix it!"
2,Not worth the money,I don't think you should spend the $40.00 on this scale. It doesn't accurately display your weight. I weigh myself one morning and I'm a certain weight and then the next morning I either gained or lossed 4lbs. The only pro about this scale is its sleek design..thats what your paying for!!
3,Close but no cigar!,"Great design aesthetically, and good price but not a precision instrument by any means. If I step on the scale four successive times I'll get at least three different weights. They won't vary by much, perhaps a half pound, but enough to put a damper on my enthusiasm. If you want an ocasional pretty good estimate of your weight it's adequate. If you are on Weight Watchers and eager to track even fractional losses/gains it doesn't do the job. It's a paradox that it bears the WW name. Of course, if you step on it once a week and take the reading as gospel you can go along fat (or thin) dumb and happy. Not a scale for anal compulsives.Alan"
1,Accurate within +/-5 lbs. Battery last 2 weeks (~$5 for a set of 2) - NOT WORTH IT,The title says it all : Accurate within +/-5 lbs. Battery last 2 weeks ($5 for a set of 2) - NOT WORTH IT1) Accuracy is debatable. The readings are all over the map2) Looks nice3) Battery lasts about 2-3weeks and they are expensive (~$5). So you can do the math: 52 weeks at $5 per 2 weeks = $130 per year cost4) NOT WORTH IT!
4,I Like It!,This scale is accurate after repeated weight checks right down to a 10th of a pound. It's easy to clean with paper towels and glass cleaner. The only reason I give it only 4 stars is because I don't always like what it says! :)
3,unreliable reading,"I'd like to make a point anyone want to buy this scale to remember.Its reading is affected by the surface the scale is on.Softer surface, less reading, so don't use it on the carpet.Build and design are good. I like 0.1 lb unit, but reading is unreliable and depends on the surface."
4,No problems here,I've had this scale for a bit over a month and have had none of the accuracy and consistently problems others have complained about. I've gotten on-and-off the scale multiple times and it keeps reporting the same weight. Also just had a physical at the doctor's and his scale reported almost virtually the same weight. The tap to turn it off and on is no problem. I almost wish it had a memory feature but that is a small matter
5,Does what I needed it to,"I bought this scale to keep careful track of a family member's weight after she had major surgery. It was important to be able to see even the slightest weight gain, and this scale does just that with the increments it shows."
4,Weight Watcher Scale,"Like this scale, however, sometimes it goes crazy and gives a wrong reading. I get off, get back on and it changes. This should not be. But all in all it is a great scale."
3,not very accurate,"Pros: looks nice. attractive glass top.Cons: not very accurate. If you step on it several time yourself, the scale seems to give you exactly same weight display every time. But if someone else tried it (with different weight from yours) and then you try it again, it will show a different number from your previous ones. The difference in the weight of same person can range from 0.5 to 5 pounds at the same time on the same day."
3,Good but broke,"It's a good scale overall. Gives consistent readings, and is easy to use. Looks nice. Stopped working after using for a few months though, and I'm not fat or anything. Going to try to send it back and get a new one."
5,"very accurate, sigh","I finally replaced my spring scale with this one. The WW34 is way way more accurate, repeatable, and all those things a scale should be.DangNow I know how much way too many things weigh. I weighed myself a few times, it kept repeating the same measurement. That couldn't be true! Shoes. OK. A few repeats with and without holding the shoes. Sweatshirt, jeans ... maybe it's that cup of coffee, how much did I add there ...You get the idea. It repeated all those measurements.Now I can't blame the scale.At least it looks good sitting there on the floor."
4,Useful Digital Scale,This digital scale has been helpful in measuring small increments of weight in U.S. measure as well as metrics. This is important when you're trying to monitor weight loss and difficult to determine on an old fashion type scale. There is no problem in tapping the sensor with the foot to turn it on. The numbers are large and clear enough for easy reading. We also found it very useful in measuring luggage in order to keep within the strict weight limitations for airline travel.
1,Organic beans wrapped in,"Organic beans wrapped in ""Bisphenol A"" lined cansI went through the trouble to contact them and indeed they are using BPA lined cans.BPA is the same substance removed from plastic baby bottles, because it is rated dangerous.Many countries have already outlawed the use of BPA.To be fair it has to be said that more than 90% of all manufactures of canned products in the US use epoxies containing BPAWhy can't an ""Organic"" manufacturer not go the extra mile?Buy Eden Food beans right here at Amazon.http://www.amazon.com/Eden-Organic-Pinto-Beans-15-Ounce/dp/B000GZW5MA/ref=pd_sbs_gro_7[...]"
1,Extremely damaged goods.,"The cans arrived so badly damaged that I am concerned about getting botulism. They have been badly damaged, and yet the damage did not occur in transit to me. The goods were apparently returned from stores as being too damaged to be sold and are then sold online. I'm sure Amazon gets a good discount on the damaged goods but then charges the consumer the full amount. They cans are so out of round that I won't be able to use an electric can opener on many of them. They are also hard to stack because of the huge dents. I won't get getting any more foodstuffs from Amazon."
3,Works well for twist outs too!,"I have been natural for years and the best thing I can tell ladies considering going natural is that just because a product is expensive doesn't mean it will work the best for your hair. This product can be drying but of all the products this product holds my curls after a twist out the best.For those that don't know, a twist out is when you two strand twist your hair and then unravel the twist and wear the ringlets. This product defines your curls and is perfect for that style."
4,Recessed Hard Drive Screw,"These screws work relatively well for hard drive screws with drive caddies. On my caddies they don't fully recess, leaving a little less then a millimeter sticking above, but still far less then a standard button style hdd screw. They are also a lot cheaper then buying dedicated drive screws from a vendor."
3,Hardly any thunder,There is a lot of rain in varying degrees of intensity which sometimes sounds more like a dripping faucet but there isn't much thunder at all and what there is is very far off and very soft.
4,Lovely Sound,Lovely sound from this cd. It totally relaxes me whenever I listen to it. Good to have in your cd collection.
5,Great Cd,"The sounds were very convincing, I actually felt like I was there even my daughter thought it was really storming outside since I have a Subwoofer and was able to control the thunder intensity (all this was at night) the only thing missing was the strobe light to add to the lightnig effect. It does relax you and allows you to destress. There are other types of stress management cd's out there but if you like the outdoors and your'e not able to get away then this is what may work for you.Johnny Linan"
4,Great Thunderstorm with birds and frogs,"I really like this CD. You get varying thunder and rain instensity with birds and frogs mixed in at times. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of a strange noise that occurs a few times. It sounds like some electronic distortion or vibration. It only occurs a few times and of brief duration. I've gotten used to it and ignore it, enjoying the rest of the CD. If you like thunderstorms, I'd also recommend Thunderstorm by Echoes of Nature."
4,Relaxing,"I have this disc with ""Breaking Through The Mist"" and ""Loon Echo Lake"" on MP3 & use as sleeping aids. The music & sounds are restful. This disc has a lot more music with the nature sounds. I perfer less music & more nature noise. It's almost too much music. It distracts from the thunder & nature sounds. Overall, it works well in helping me fall asleep or just listen to relax. I think the music/nature CDs Dan Gibson creates is wonderful & useful for relaxation & sleep aids. I don't have to hear it first if I see Dan Gibson's name associated with the Disc."
2,Animals are abit weird,The thunder and rain are nice but I find the artist who made this cd added a line up of animals and frogs as background sounds. Its nice if you like the sounds of birds and stuff but I like my thunderstorms without all of that extra noise.
4,Decent Thundershower Sounds,"I purchased this to desensitize my dog to the sound of thunderstorms. He's not as anxious when a storm materializes, so it must be doing the trick."
1,Nature music,"Don't get this unless you like GREAT thunder and rain that sounds like someone ""peeing"" (a constant drip throughout the entire CD). It was so annoying that I returned it. Too bad, the thunder was excellent."
1,used cd it was damaged and did not play all the way,"This was my first time buying something used on line. It will be my last. The seller offered to give me a refund if i mailed it back. It was a $7.oo cd not worth paying postage again. Amazon.com is a good sight, and I will probaly use it again. Next time I will buy a new cd."
4,"heartbreaking, uplifting","As an older woman lucky enough to be married to my soul mate, who happens to be a bit older than I am, I both loved this book and had a hard time reading it, as it made me imagine losing my own husband. Rudy and Christina made a world of their own in upstate New York, with drinks at five culminating their respective day of creative work. What an enviable life--and what sorrow for Christina once Rudy is gone. In some ways this reminded me of Joan Didion's Year of Magical Thinking, another book that celebrates a collaborative couple, and explores the grief endured by the first one left behind."
1,Evenings at Five,"I was caught by the cover and pencil drawings, but once inside, I felt trapped. I've been that route of grieving myself, and it didn't ring true. It had an elitist, and narcisstic tone to it.And why did the author bother to disguise it as fiction, and touch so lightly on the alchoholism?I found the rememdy for grief was to turn outward, not inward."
1,wrench,"this company was a good company to do business with had no problems with them , but the product was made out of cheap materials that were weak"
5,Much needed tool,I used these pliers as soon as they arrived. They worked great! Now I truly have a full set of tools!
4,Tight Plot,"This is a tight plot with no last minute add-ins to tie up all of the loose ends.. You get to make your guess about who did the crime and who will do the time. Pleasantly, all aspects of the story are germane to the plot. There is even some cool probability theory stuff that is brought in, clearly explained and an important part of the plot. However, if you are the type of reader who likes, lots of hard-edged, foul mouthed in your face tough stuff, this is not the book for you. If you like to see detectives actually detecting with thier brain (rather than other body parts) than this is a book for you."
3,Only for the serious student of nutcases,"I read a review of this in the Marine Corp Gazette and it spawned my interest in the subject of today's suicide bombers and the like so I bought it. Well, it is a serious and detailed look at mass movements as the author calls it. It was written some time ago and certainly applies today. But it requires the reader to be very serious about the subject. I started out okay but soon I was having to make myself go on. It is probably the most in depth look at the subject but a tough read."
4,"Thought Provoking, Jolly Good Read","This book is a must for students of political behaviour. His insights are profound, clearly stated and well explained."
5,Might change your life,This was one of the enlightening books I have ever read. I only wish I had been forced to read this instead of Catcher In the Rye or Dracula.
5,Important,"In an age of electing people based on star qualities, Hoffer shows the parallels we share with the Europeans (and Americans) of the 1930's. Hoffer shows that emotion is misplaced when it comes to charting the course of a society, yet is always present in generous measure in those societies that fail."
5,Best Book Ever Witten about Fanatism and Mass Movements,Without question the most insightful book written to date on the mind of the terrorist. This masterpiece by Hoffer is more relevant than ever in light of the events of September 11th .. ..and it was published in 1951.
2,Nothing New Here but Assertions,"This book has many disconnected thoughts and ideas about ""mass movements"" but nothing really sticks. He never seems to have compelling arguments for his generalizations. a book on modern social psychology has much better explanations for his concept of ""mass movements"". He spends a lot of time dividing people into categories and classifications. If some of his generalizations don't fit some of his examples, he simply dismisses them. The last paragraph of the book, the capstone you might call it, blew me away. What is he saying? The jews, and later the christians, invented 'this malady of the soul' called fanatacism? I don't know what to think or say. Here we go again with ""the jews started it."""
4,"Probably a fine book, if I had the philosophically-oriented mind to fully appreciate it","I wish Hoffer could have lived and written 60 years later than he did. As examples of ""true believers"" he mainly had to cite the Nazis, the communists, and the Christian crusaders. I would like to have seen his take on the more contemporary true believers, particularly the jihadist Muslims, the Tea Party, McCarthyism, evangelical Christians of today, etc."
3,On the origins of fanaticism,"This book was written more or less in the Vietnam era by a Longshoreman who was a self-styled conservative philosopher. Hoffer was turned off by the left-wing fanatacism of that time. This was the era in which Maoism was fashionable among a few western academics who, unlike their Chinese counterparts, did not have to do cultural duty on pig farms and in rice fields.Hoffer is, however, up to date. His argument is not about left-wing fanatacism in particular, but instead discusses the causes of fanatacism in general. The book may help you somewhat to understand the tendency of internally-unhappy people toward extremist movements of all stripes, whether fascist, communist, El Quaida, the Taliban, the Christian Coalition, neo-conservative, or others. Citizens who are wondering why America is where it is today might profit a bit from reading The True Believer."
1,Liberal Selfishness,"This book is written from the perspective of our liberal selfish culture and ridicules the idea that people could do more to improve their situation in life by cooperatively working to improve their corner of the world than by working for selfish gain. It is no surprise that this book is so popular given that we live in a selfish liberal culture. My one star review reflects the fact that I am not part of that culture. Numerous books written before the liberal cultural plague explain the value of cooperation. Examples include de Tocqueville, Hobbes, Machiavelli's Discourses, Livy, and of course all religious writing from the Bible to the Analects.Note - I only read the beginning and skimmed the rest since I found it intolerable."
2,Pure Drivel,"I buy books like this for the ideas and insights they they might provide me about people. I got absolutely nothing out of this one. Eric Hoffer over-uses flowery vocabulary which causes his writing to have poor flow. This makes the book unpleasant to read despite its short length.The entire book is a list of pontifications, and I found no eye-opening revelations in any of them. It's a book that leaves you feeling like you could have written it better yourself. I can imagine no point in the history of mankind where this book would have been considered insightful, useful, or necessary. Pure drivel.To be fair, the title does say ""thoughts"", and that is all it is; a collection of thoughts that could as easily have been yours as Hoffer's. The references used are good for little more than allowing you to cock your head, raise an eyebrow, rest an index finger across your lips, and say, ""Hmmm""."
4,Late 1950s LeGrand...HOT!,"The ""editorial review"" shown above is inexplicably mismatched and more than half of it has nothing to do with ""LeGrand Jazz""! The first ""listener review"" is the correct one. This classic session is from circa1958--not the generation afterward. Very swinging; inspired arranging. The finest jazz musicians on the scene (in a very significant year for jazz records)--you'll hear them on this session! Michel from early in his career."
4,excellent,"Too few people know Michel Legrand, and half of those don't as a jazz musician. The understated name this master has mostly came from 1960s soundtracks:The Thomas Crown Affairis most well known.Legrand's arranging is indelible. He has American swing and European elegance. We now think of crime jazz as a cleche, but Legrand's work of the era showed that cloak and dagger, swingin' pad sound really did exist. Just ask his horns.On Legrand jazz, his stamp is put on standards. This album was made in the 1950s, before he wrote the sophisticated structures for his brilliant film scores. ""Night In Tunisia,"" and ""Round Midnight"" are here.To me these sound more like cool jazz. It does have dramatic flair: not as much as Legrand developed in the 1960s. The arrangements here remind me of Gil Evan's. Not surprising: my copy has Legrand sitting next to Miles Davis."
5,The single best electricians tool,"I have been using the knipex electricians plier for years. I love this tool because it is truly an excellent 4 in 1 tool. It is light, durable, and well crafted. I especially like it because I do a lot of work with stranded wire. It allows me cut, strip, and terminate with just one tool."
1,not a good book,"This book does not show hot to build a hot rod, just differnt types. no real techincal data. pass on this one!"
3,Great book but narrator speaks fast,"Narrator speaks fast like her main point is to finish the story. No original voices of the characters, but the narrator tries her best to imitate them. No special sound to indicate it is time to change the page.Other than that, my 4-year-old daughter likes the book only she keeps asking me when is time to turn the page.Sturdy book. Lots of illustrations."
4,Excellent Mouse,"I bought a new Mac and needed a mouse with buttons to go forward and back, and this is excellent.Works great with the Mac and was priced great."
5,Easy to use,"I'm using this mouse right now, and I love this thing. Works great, and is comfortable to use. I like the button layout as well.Nick"
4,Good quality ergonomic mouse for the price.,"I got this mouse to replace my Apple Mighty Mouse that came with my iMac, mainly because the scroll ball in that one is horrible once it gets dirtied up with no way of cleaning. Plus I wanted one with a better shape for my hand, and the Logitech MX400 fit the bill.PROS: Good design that's comfortable in my hand. Extremely precise laser tracking. 5 programmable buttons. Scroll wheel works vertically and horizontally (though not at the same time like the Apple scroll ball). Very reasonable price.CONS: Side buttons are to easy to accidentally push with thumb. Scroll wheel is not as smooth scrolling as some."
5,Great Mighty Mouse Replacement!,Needed a replacement for my Mac mighty mouse. The MX 400 performs very well... no compatibility issues!
2,Scroll Wheel just stops working!!!,I really wanted to like this mouse but so far it has given me nothing but grief. If you plan on leaving your computer on for extended periods of time and then coming back to it to do some work you may find that your scroll wheel no longer scrolls pages. I have had to on several occasions unplug and replug in my mouse in order to get the scroll wheel working again. This is absolutely UNEXCEPTIBLE Logitech! What happened to Logitech? You used to be able to count on them for quality products now I am wondering if I should switch back to Micro$oft products. I may give the Micro$oft Laser Mouse 6000 a try and take the MX 400 back.
5,Logitech Mouseman Wheel is back !! OO,Logitech Mouseman Wheel is back !! OOIn a shocking move. Logitech has brought back the design and shape of the old Mouseman Wheel with updated laser and control technology and not in the old blue color.
2,Middle button very stiff - returned,"This is a well-manufactured mouse, but if you use the middle button a lot, forget it. It's much stiffer than the middle button on Logitech's other mice and may give you a bruise if you try to use it too much.Also, the acceleration was very different from most mice. It can undoubtedly be adjusted in software preferences, but I fail to see the justification for a mouse that doesn't work out of the box these days.After trying this mouse for a couple of hours I returned it and got myself a trusty MX-310. No surprises there, just a good mouse."
4,nice accurate mouse,"We have been using the Logitech MX 400 corded laser mouse for almost a month now. The mouse works fine. On the downside, one of the reasons we paid extra for this mouse was the zoom button on top. It requires too much force to depress and use it. We ended up using the zoom slider on the keyboard for zoom. The mouse is not used for gaming so we didn't bother to program the side buttons. This was probably too much mouse for our needs (internet and email for sight impaired person)."
5,Great grat mouse,I'm an architecture student so I'm computer constantly using autocad and the such. I started developing pains in my mousing hand from my old unergonic dell mouse so i decided it was time to upgrade. This is by far one of the most comfortable mice i have used. I decided to get the corded version because i didn't want to be changing batteries all the time. nice job logitech!
2,Dissapointed: Excellent Mouse . . . Until Button Malfunctions - Repair possible,"I had this mouse for 3 years. Very happy with it until the left click button starts to malfunction. Now every time I click, it double or triple clicks.Update: I took the mouse apart including the microswitches under the left mouse button. Wiggling the metal parts inside the microswitch (maybe aligning them) and putting all back together fixed the problem (at least for now)."
5,Still works great!,I purchased this mouse MX 400 in the spring of 2007 and it still works perfect as of 2011. The finish has held up well.
3,Excellent mouse but software is buggy,"I have a MacBook with Intel Core 2 Duo, running OS 10.4.10. I downloaded the latest MX 400 driver software from the Logitech site and installed it. It looks simple to set up, but once you do you will find that weird errors start to pop up randomly (error -9870 for example) and some functions just don't work at all. Using the forward side button to page forward on a web site, for example--the most common use of that button--simply didn't work. The back button worked, but not the forward. Huh??Software complaints aside, the mouse itself is excellent--good feel, good size, etc. But Mac users: keep looking."
3,An okay mouse; terrible terrible software,"I've been using this one for half a year now, and it's a very nice and comfortable mouse. I bought it specifically to be able to scroll horizontally. Well, what has to pointed out is that it doesn't work as well as expected. Even though one can tweak the settings, one ends up with a comfortable scrolling speed in some applications, but in some others it's just too fast/too slow.I also dislike the fact that there is no way to get rid of zooming of images when you scroll in an image viewer (unless you get rid of scrolling function altogether).Another disadvantage is that if you click a Back/Forward button, not necessarily will they work. It actually takes time to register in a browser, which is annoying. Again, most other times it works fine.I blame software. Note that you must install it to be able to tweak most settings of the mouse, including the horizontal scrolling function."
5,Works fine out of the box (Mac),"I have a 3-year-old Mac desktop and I do not require a lot of features from a mouse. This mouse is very comfortable (if you're using it right-handed) and tracks very well without a mouse pad. The two main buttons work out of the box (no software install) as does the scroll wheel for scrolling up, down, right, left, and as a third mouse button. It is nice that this type of mouse does not blind you if you look at the bottom of it.I'm really happy with this mouse. If you are looking for a solid, reliable mouse, this is a good choice. If you don't need fancy features like zoom, the quality of the software doesn't matter because you don't have to install it. I haven't installed the software so I can't review that."
5,Perfect casual mouse,"Being a touchpad user for so long I decided to give the mouse another try. Using so many different mice in labs around school I knew I wanted something with good tracking. The laser tracking lives up to it's name. I haven't found a surface it won't track on. On top of that, this mouse comes with a list of features. With the software you can program the buttons to perform a wide range of tasks. From internet browsing to window management. Pretty much every feature is customizable. I haven't found a better buy yet. This is a great product."
3,Love it EXCEPT For Reliability,"I've owned 2 of these. One died in 6 months, the other started shorting out at about 6 months, but Kinda still works. I tend to squeeze mice kind of hard & I believe that slowly causes some component on the side of the mouse to die.Other then the reliability issue, (a big other!), I am fond of this mouse, great fit for my hand & very accurate tracking. I've experienced similar reliability issues with every Logitech mouse I've owned in 11 years of computing."
2,Mouse needs work,"I returned this mouse after testing it briefly. Two major reasons:- Clicking the scroll wheel takes too much effort- While playing World of Warcraft, scrolling with the scroll wheel caused the cursor to immediately jump to the upper left corner of the screen. A cursory search indicates this is an issue with Logitech's Macintosh drivers"
4,Love this mouse,"I wanted a wired, simple, smooth, accurate mouse that feels nice and navigates easily. This mouse is."
4,Great Mouse for the Money,"This wired mouse is quite good and better than my past mouse, Apple's Mighty Mouse. My current screen resolution is 2560 x 1600 and this mouse it able to provide pixel by pixel feedback. For the price well worth it."
2,$50 bucks for this???,"the scroll wheel click is SO ANNOYING! its freaking LOUD! no problem scrolling down, but scrolling up is really loud CLICK CLICK CLICK CLICK CLICKI can't believe i paid $50 freaking bucks for thisalso, a problem is when customizing the buttons, you cant make the side to side scroll wheel buttons function as scroll ! this is an essential function for technical analysis in finance. will be sending this back, too bad I shredded the crap out of the packaging"
4,Coastal hot pot.,"A richly edited compilation of surfers and coastal dwellers.Busy and lively with images from early Hawaiian and Californian eras to the worldwide surfing scene of the present day .Abstractly put together ,it's a lovely mish mash of surfing's highly visual imagery.I really enjoy this book and go back to browse through it often.It complements the other books put out by Tom Adler."
5,A brilliant exploration into the heart,"This novel caught me by surprise. I expected the writing to be good, but it's nearly perfect. Robinson has created highly believable characters and a story line that grips from beginning to end. The persona of Isabel is beautifully wrought. The reader can worry about her, get annoyed with her, understand and love her. As for her new family: I felt as if Robinson invited me to stand in a corner of that rustic retreat and observe the action. It was a great visit."
1,Not as good as hoped,"I read this book in hopes of giving to my Grandma as it sounded like somthing she would enjoy. In the end however, I found it trite and frankly boring. The characters were far too one-dimensional for me to dredge up any sympathy or interest. Robinson had several good ideas and somethimes you can catch a glimpse of what she was trying to achieve but overall I found this book to be a letdown. But that's just me :-)."
4,liked it just fine,I liked that this book was a nice read and allowed me to escape for a few moments each day. Just what I was looking for! Robinson did a great job of keeping my interest and keeping me up late at night.
2,"get a rolled pad, not a folded one","I bought two of these pads: one 8x10 and one 10x14 (or so). They were billed as ""premium"" rug pads by a local dealer. The trouble is that they are folded so tightly in their ""bag"" they actually stretch (apparently permanently). They will not lay flat on a hardwood floor -- even after a week or two. One is under a relatively lightweight handmade rug, but the other is under a very dense and heavy (~ 150 lb) handmade rug; both have ""mountains"" that don't go away and are a tripping hazard.I have a cheaper pad from a department store rug shop that has been perfect for 10 years (under another rug) -- we brought it home ""rolled"" and it has been smooth and wrinkle-free from day one. Like this pad, it has a rubber side and a ""grippy"" side and I wish I had bought more."
3,"Was looking for more ""loft""",I specifically was looking for a pad that made a low-pile area rug softer and cushier underfoot. Do they make these sort of pads any more? This pad grips well but is thin and does not make the rug softer. I'm going out to try a layer of foam rubber this morning. I will say that it arrived as fast as lightning and the price was good.
2,Say goodbye to this,"Not worth the $ - odd mix and the unneeded political commentary was annoying - e.g., with the Vincent Foster quote - ""His death was ruled a suicide, although some right-wing groups charged that the Clintons had him killed and then covered up the murder."" Or about Charlie Chaplin, ""He had less control elsewhere; disgusted in the 1950s by right-wing attempts to paint him as a communist, he eventually settled in Switzerland."" Or after a quote from George Gipp: ""(Ronald Reagan, who also had a gift for the apocryphal...)"" Or after Voltaire:""...was asked in he would finally recognize the divinity of Jesus Christ. Voltaire, who spent his life fighting ignorance and violence, ..."" Give me a break from liberal interpretations of history, people. Just the facts, mam."
4,I loved this little book:,"Some quotes are funny, some are sad, but it's an interesting book that I had got from the library twice. Then decided I'd like to own it."
3,interesting and cute for the money,a good book for a waiting room or even a powder room...entertaining and worth what I spent! I would recommend this book to anyone just for interesting reading
5,Individually Wrapped Quality,"The first thing I noticed upon receiving these cables (I ordered quite a few, in different sizes) is that they are packaged in individual ziplock bags, rather than bound by twist-ties like so many other cables. I'm not exactly sure why, but this left me with a positive impression.Getting the cables out of their pouches, they appear to be high quality, better than others I've purchased online in the past. The variety of sizes is definitely a plus. I'd definitely order more from Tripp Lite if need more patch cables."
3,Expect what you pay for,"I purchased two of these and, while the one is still working well, the cable i connected to my gaming PC has died within a month of purchase. For the price the cable is not worth returning, I'd rather just put my own together. The point of buying these was to save a little time; however it seems I was only 50% successful. I'd say your results are going to be hit or miss with TRIPP LITE."
2,Disappointed Dummie,"This book was very disappointing. I would guess it was written by a reporter with little or no actual knowledge of the inner workings of the Mac Mini. Following his instructions on adding an external 3.5"" outboard hard drive to the interior ATA bus completely leaves out the fact that it is not possible to leave the optical drive connected to the same bus due to the terrific difference in speed. He seems to have interviewed someone who had done it or had known someone who had done it.I expected more. I was very disappointed."
2,Bought a MAC MINI and Hacked it,I bought a used MAC MINI and decided to check out the design and upgrade (HACK IT).PROUseful informationEasy to read (I love most DUMMIES books)A good place to startCONBetter info found on the internetOlder Data (to be fair expected)OVERALLWould not buy again
2,Mac for Dummies or What me worry?,Why did I buy this book?Am I a Dummie?I thought it might have a bit of information on the guts of the Mac Mini....Wrong.Dont bother.Maybe I'll return it.
5,Restrictivism: The Only Option!,"Contrary to Sanders and Fackre, Nash did an excellent job refuting both inclusivism and PME, and presented his case for restrictivism well. Though I don't agree totally with Nash's restrictivism (since I hold to unlimited atonement), he does a good job presenting a very persuasive case for the traditional evangelical understanding of the destinies of the unevangelized. Sanders' inclusivism leads to the heresy of works-salvation (unbelievers who positively respond to God's light and walk in His ways will be saved even without knowledge of Christ). Such heresy leads to another heresy: that Christians also must do good works to earn or maintain their salvation. His interpretation of Romans 2 on pp. 46-7 is horrible (he follows the interpretation of the ""new perspective"" that Paul was not opposing Jewish works-salvation but Jewish nationalism). ... Overall, a good book for those who want to be convinced of the truthfulness of restrictivism."
5,Elucidating the Book of Errors,"'BaMidbar' is the great book of the people of Israel's wanderings, sins and errors. It contains some of the most frequently asked and commented upon questions ( Why did Moses hit the rock, instead of speaking to it as he was commanded? What was behind Miriam and Aaron's seeming speaking negatively about Moses? ) in the Bible. As always the commentary of Nehama Leibowitz contains answers given by the historically great commentators of the Jewish tradition, Rashi, Rambam, Ramban, ibn Ezra, Abarbanel etc and modern favorites ( Hirsch, David Hoffman) . And as always are included the questions for further study which are to prompt the student into deeper involvement in the text."
3,Dated,"I have seen this writer and book referenced on many shows and sites. I ordered the book with great expectations and was disappointed. I realize that at one time the information in this book was ""cutting edge "" , but that day is long gone. If you are a frequent watcher of ""Ancient Aliens"" and shows of the like , you probably are familiar with most the things discussed in this book - not that it is without much valuable information , but most of the information I have have already come across via YouTube videos , general internet searches and shows like ""Ancient Aliens"". I have great respect for the author and would have found this book more interesting 10 years ago. This book (in my opinion) is good - not very good and not great. I was disappointed but you never know what's in a book until you read it !"
5,Light years better than anything on radio,"How 7m3 can't get a song on radio these days is beyond me. I'm afraid Seven Mary Three may always be a ""one hit wonder"" in the eyes of the world, which is a crying shame. They're putting out better music these days than nearly every popular band out there. Problem is, they can't get a deal, or support from a major record label. Perhaps because of the ""one hit wonder"" stigma.I've owned Dis/Location since the day it came out, and I've played it so much that I don't know it can even still work. Jason Ross's lyrics are pure brilliance. It's really what attracts me to the band. He's a poet, and his lyrics really hit home with me. Stand out songs on the CD are ""Settle Up"", ""Without You Feels"", ""Bark No Bite"", ""Blue Letter"", and ""Made to be Broken"".If any non 7m3 fan comes across this review, I urge you to do yourself a favor and get this CD. You'll be treating yourself to hours and hours of listening pleasure."
4,"4 1/2, better than what some reviewers are saying","I can't believe that some people don't like this album...it's just so, good!I agree with the one reviewer that is wondering how 7M3 can't get radio play. Without You Feels would make an amazing single, and would definitely bring them up to ""2-Hit Wonder"" status, because it's an absolutely fantastic song. That being said, so are Settle Up, Dislocation, Bark No Bite, Oceans of Envy, Made to Be Broken, and basically the rest of the album.It's a completely different sound than anything else they've done, and I think they took a turn for the better. I loved American Standard and Economy of Sound (Rock Crown and Orange Ave. were very good too, but not in comparison), but this CD is just incredible.Do yourselves a favor, give these guys a chance."
4,rockin!,I'm glad they're back. This record is really rockin. It's no frills and in your face. Songs like Settle Up and Bark No Bite really got me goin and the first single Without You Feels could and should be all over the place. Give this a listen!
3,"Good, yes; great, hardly","This is nothing short of an average cd from the world of today's rock. There is nothing cutting edge, nor is there anything mindblowing on any of the tracks. Without You Feels and By Your Side are arguably the best songs, both being catchy tunes, but like one of the songs says, there isn't much bite behind the bark that proclaims that 7m3 is back. Don't get me wrong; it is a good cd. If you like today's rock music, most likely you will really like this. I like the cd for that reason, because I know that there are a lot of good bands out there and there is nothing wrong with being good. Unfortunately, you can get this same music by purchasing virtually any other modern rock cd out there. Man, I wish a savior would come and save music."
5,LISTEN UP!!!!!,"HEY EVERYBODY, LISTEN UP!!!!If you haven't heard the new album from Seven Mary Three: Dis/Location now's your chance!! Dis/Location is just awesome! My personal favorite from this album is "" By Your Side"" it's such a great song, and it rocks. So I highly reccommend buying this new album, and telling all of your friends about it!!! But hey, don't take my word for it, just simply listen to some clips of the first 5 songs, and you'll be hooked!!!"
5,7M3 is good for you.,"If you prefer real rock and roll to all the pre-fabricated sugar-coated crap that is dominating the music industry right now, you need this album! Seven Mary Three knows how Rock should be, and they prove it on this album. Unlike most albums out there today, there isn't one song on this album that isn't worth listening to. If you don't have this album, you don't know what you're missing. 7M3 is good for you."
2,step backward,"I think the band took a big step backward with this CD. After two great offerings, this CD is made up of a bunch of sound-alike songs that blend together into one long roaring sludge. Not a single song stands out here. Newcomers would be better off going with ""Orange Ave."" or ""Economy of Sound"" instead."
1,Gift,"This was given as a gift to someone in another country. When the package was opened, there was no CD in it. The wrappings were discarded before the discovery of no CD.I have e-mailed the company that sent it but have not heard anything back yet."
3,Poor quality blade + damaged when it came. Family is sword collectors,"Overall I would give it a 5 star if the handle of the sword wasn't ripped (im posting a picture up and sending a complaint to the company who sent me the sword). The sword's quality was not good at all, the cloth and handles were like bought from a dollar store or something, but i guess you get what you pay for. The sword is great for display, this is my 3rd longest sword and my 2nd one which is made out of black carbon steel. =]"
2,ichigo tensa bankai,"although the item is cool, the condition that i received it in was horrible. the paint that was used on the sword to make it black was applied too much at a time and left drip marks all over the blade. on top of that, it was not prepped properly before being painted and the paint was beginning to chip off. i had to spend more money to buy the materials to repaint the sword and make it how it was supposed to be. for the amount of money paid for this, i was not happy with it."
1,Poor fabrication.,"I just received my slicing moon sword and after reading the other reviews my expectations were high. After I opened the box I pull the sword out and the chain was not the style in the picture, it was held on by a key ring. The chain links are also a different style, and there is an object that looks like a lions head on the end of the chain also held on by a key ring. The handles wrapping was very poorly done. The blades quality was also lacking. I am very disappointed in the overall quality of the sword."
4,Tensa Zangetsu,All around good sword. The only complaint I have is about the giant crack in the sheathe. The crack looks like someone grabbed the sheathe then tried to break it over their leg but was unsuccessful in the attempt. The blade itself was not damaged so its all good.
2,This book is very badly written,"My graduate Forest Ecosystems class was burdened with this textbook as the main class reading material. Not only was this book badly written, but even the professor was frustrated with the terseness of the material. My opinion is that if this is a textbook, one should not need a PhD to read and understand it. Unfortunately however, the authors assume that either you already know everything there is to know about the subjects that they are trying to explain, or that you have read all of the papers that they have ever published and are familiar with their work (from which they draw most of the examples of the book). In summary, if you want a good textbook about forest ecosystems, you will have to look elsewhere."
5,Excellent book with historical depth,"A masterpiece that descruibes the historical context and the motivations of the different groups that participated in the Lebanese civil war. Essential reading for anyone who wants to understand Lebanon, its 15year civil war, and some of the background behind the conflict in the Middle East."
4,A good addition,If you already know about the civil war in Lebanon then this book is a wonderful way to get a different perspective. It is not a comprehenisve study of the wars.
5,Insightful,Sandra writes a great book about the complex and interesting vectors that have to be understand and known to even start to comprehend the many factors that together make LEBANON.I use this book as a constant reference for the Lectures on Middle East that I give to universities.
4,Excellent Description of the Civil War,"This book does a great job completely describing Lebanon before the civil war and everything leading up the war. I didn't know very much at all about the folks living there but Sandra does a great job describing the background of the people (The Muslim and Christian factions). I also had no idea about the involvment of Israel and Palestine.I won't lie though, parts of the book are dry and probably go into too much detail. While I did enjoy reading the majority of the book, I actually did fall asleep while reading it once. Still, I would recommend this book"
4,Powerful rhythm and beat!,"This one makes you want to move - no doubt. Even my 2 year old can't seem to resist it. I use it while on the treadmill and it keeps me motivated and going. The only con (although I reach for this music each time I workout) is that after listening to it for a while it feels a bit monotonous and you can't tell when one song has ended and the other started as it is not in English. I tend to use songs as cues to see how far I am in my workout, so with this one I just lose myself in the music and keep on until it ends! And, that's one long workout!"
1,I'm conservative and I DISAPPROVE of this book,"Sorry Limbaugh boy, but calling the media liberal even when it supports rightwing lunatics is nothing more than blissful ignorance. A true conservative wouldn't approve of the current destruction current neoconservatives like Bush, Rove, Delay, Cheney, Rumsfeld, and most of the Republican Party as well as some pro-GOP Democrats are dragging this country into. But never mind the fact that the looney rightwing radicals have misused the word ""conservative"" and the rightwing media to cover up their destructive agenda from public detection ! Pathetic book !"
1,A Simple Truth,"The media is conrolled by those ""who hold the purse strings,"" just as in politics.It doesn't take much to see the media is owned not only literally, but in advertising and funding dollars, by big money (the cororations and super rich who either own the corporations and/or get their wealth through stock in corporations.)This has always been the controlling force of the media and any analysis that doesn't include this is formulated by a ""liar.""Why aren't there more books on this very basic fact. Might I suggest as an anidote to these miss-the-point books, a viewing of the documentary ""Tell the Story and Run: George Seldes and the American Press."" Seldes life forever revealed the hollowness of the media and those who write such dishonest books as this."
1,National Hypnosis,"Oh please, would you Neoconservatives stop the lies that you and the liberals are political enemies. There will no meltdown of the liberal media because the conservatives DESPARATELY NEED the liberal media to survive to keep third party candidates off the ballot, and dupe the masses into believing that modern Liberalism and Conservatism are different political ideologies (they both came from the same philosophers, Hegel and Machiavelli). Writers such as Bozell, Liberal or Conservative are merely pawns of the Demopublican/Republicrat elitists. My suggestion is to read both Liberal and Conservative books and sort out the lies for yourself, don't just read one side."
1,No hot sauce,The pump was broken and when I opened the bottle and turned it upside down NOTHING cameout!!! Completely disappointed. I now have to take the time to return an empty bottle and won't take my chances purchasing this online again. Complete waste!!!
2,Hot Stuff Not So Hot,"I was disappointed in this product. I did not notice any improvement in using heat and the sauce. I thought it would be a noticeable improvement to my hair after using a heated dryer, does not live up to it's advertised description."
2,Tried it but didn't like it.,"I read all the other reviews and decided to try this product. I only used a little but even so, it left a heavy waxy feel to my hair, I'm going to stick with Chi even though I don't care for the way it smells. At least Chi leaves my hair soft and shiney."
1,Bait & Switch,"I purchased this product more for the bottle, as crazy as it sounds we all have collection of different items. ;) When I ordered this product online it was shown in a hot sauce-looking bottle but when I received my package it was just the typical bottle AND broken. When I contacted the seller they were unhelpful, rude & careless! To the point that they lost this valuable customer's service! Good luck if buying from them, hopefully you'll get what you thought you are/were paying for.....if not, don't expect any customer service. :("
1,Not for me,"My hair tends to be very dry and prone to breakage. So, I was looking for a product that would condition, strenghten and protect my hair from heat damage. Which is what this product claims to do. I used this product for two months, however my hair remained very dry and the amount of breakage did not improve. Just not for me!"
4,Did nothing for my hair,"This product must be for caucasian folks because it certainly did nothing for my black ethnic hair. After reading all the reviews on it I just had to have it. I got it and first of all you got to use a whole lot just to cover the hair and it does not make it shine. I don't know if I was using it with a curling iron and should have tried it with a flat iron but it should have produced the same results. I will try it with a flat iron and see what happens but until then, this product does not work for nothing."
1,Avoid the new pump bottle,"The old formula in the 2 oz squeeze bottle was terrific.But there are real problems with the new 1.7 oz pump bottle. One major flaw is that the pump DOESN'T WORK. It has no central tube to feed the product to the pump. You could pump all day, and it wouldn't work.FHI is a good company, but they don't seem to be paying attention to Quality Assurance in their manufacturing process. They need to fix these problems, or risk losing their loyal customers.Better yet, they should just forget the pump bottle and bring back the old squeeze bottle.In trying to ""update"" their product with a pump bottle, FHI has messed things up. There was nothing wrong with the old squeeze bottle in the first place. IF IT AIN'T BROKE, DON'T FIX IT."
1,Unhappy with product,"I have purchased this product before and have been very happy with it. This time i was sent a different product. When I complained about it I was told that the packaging had changed, which is incorrect. I have purchased both products and the packaging had nothing to do with it. The product I requested was the Fhi Heat with crystalized jojoba and what I received was Fhi heat thermal heat-activated conditioner. I am not a satisfied customer!"
5,Really hope for a DVD release!,"This is a great Awesome movie of one of my all time favorite artist, ever since I was 9 years old. I really hope that this is one that is released on DVD in the future."
3,Natalie Cole Story should be in DVD,"Enjoyed the Natalie Cole movie for the first time on BET channel. I am a collector of biography videos, but I look DVD format only. The movie itself was very good and well portrayed. VHS is outdated and don't want to buy VHS version. If it were sold in DVD, I would have purchased it immediately. Otherwise, very good bio of Natalie Cole. Just not in VHS format desired."
1,poor quality,I was heartbroken at the quality of this vid. I was looking forward to it so much. Ah well... c'est la vie.
5,"Pursuit...Perry's best book since ""Sleeping Dogs""","Couldn't put the book down...the details, the dialogue,the characters...only thing that could have been better??? A few more chapters. Mr. Perry rounds out his characters so well that I can see them vividly in my mind as I read. I have not been a fan of the Jane Whitfield(?) series;read a couple of them. I always hoped that Mr. Perry would bring back characters similar to ""the Butcher's Boy"" and ""Sleeping Dogs"". He finally did. I highly recommend the book to all mystery/action lovers."
4,Another gem by Thomas Perry,"People may not like this book because of the slow pace in certain sections. This is essential, because if you're trying to catch a mouse, you may have to lie in wait for long periods of time - or in the case of 'Pursuit', spend lots of time establishing you are someone you are not in order to catch your prey. This is typical Perry, paying attention to detailed real life situations of people who make livings either killing poeple of making them disappear. An excellent, if somewhat violent, read."
3,I Agree with JD Schaefer (above),"I came on here to write a review. I just finished this book. I read JD Schaiefers review and had nothing more to add. Yes, it was a good set up. It hooked me and I actually read the entire thing to find out what happens but it wasn't a joyful journey to the end rather it was a plodding ponderous - ""when will it finally end?"" kind of trip.I may try one of his earlier novels like another reviewer suggested.They can't all be winners I guess!"
3,Requires an Enormous Suspension of Disbelief,"Most books require the reader to suspend their disbelief of things that we know are not ""real"". But this book stretches things so far, that the characters are like comic book characters and it was hard for me to think I was reading anything but a comic book.The book is a replay of the movie and book ""Shane"", in which we have the good and moral gunslinger heading for the showdown with the immoral and evil gunslinger. The fact that the ""good"" gunslinger makes a living tracking down and killing professional hit men requires too much suspension for me. And the bad guy only kills 23 people in the space of a few months. But he's not a serial killer.Everyone has super senses, chiseled chins and steely grey eyes, and olympic-class athlete bodies. I kept waiting for a super-hero to show up and take care of the mess.Not a terrible read, but you can do a lot better."
5,"Can't stop re-reading it, what a book!","An intellectual suspense novel filled with plenty of nail-biting, page-turning twists and the unexpected. Prescott and Varney are both formidable adversaries, and pairing the two off against each other is a titanic struggle to see who comes out on top. The constant traps, trickery, and calculated risks keep you on the edge of your seat and you can re-read it several times and still enjoy the story just as much as the first time. One of Perry's best to be sure."
2,Please someone wake me up.,To much description and really long. I just couldn't getintrested in the plot.
3,maybe in the right mood,I admit I've had a lot of distractions and that novel reading is not my favorite kind of thing to focus on but I'm having trouble getting into this book. A Canadian friend recommended it and maybe someday I'll have to amend this review but for now...so so.
3,Good Value When on Sale,"I purchased these when Amazon was running a 4 for 3 sale. Price came to about 12 bucks a glass.The design is lovely. The glasses are heavy and can stand up to dishwashing. Only gripe I have is that there is a visible seam going down the side of the glass. For twelve bucks, I don't mind. But I would never use these for a fine dining event."
3,"good content, average writing","I frequently read biographies and autobiographies. I was a bit disappointed in this one. The content is good, however the writing is simply average I thought. The parts Ingrid wrote herself were the most interesting; the parts written by the biographer were dull (this book alternated between Ingrid's writing and the biographer). The format was a bit odd as well, with the alternation. I'm about 400 pages into the book and not sure I will finish it. I enjoyed it for the most part, but I find I am getting a bit bored with it."
5,Who Knew?,I had no idea that Ingrid Bergman had such a complicated and interesting life. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book.
3,Not that great,"I just had one replaced recently from Bissell. My first one worked okay a few times then it got really hot and started to smell like something was burning. I had it for less than 6 months. I replaced the belt, which was not that easy to get to.Cleaning all of the filters are somewhat of a hassle, especially when the main one in front gets stuck and you can't get the canister out. The dust will shoot out of the back, regardless so you go over and over the same spot and the indicator light never comes on to let you know that area is clean.It is bulky, hard to maneuver, quite heavy and the long cord can be a deterent instead of an asset.Considering I got mine on sale after Christmas and seeing the price here, I would never have bought this unit or this brand.But the people at Bissell are nice and they do work with you."
4,Powerfull vacuum!,"I was very impressed by the power and ease of this vacuum! It practically moves on it's own and it sucks up everything! We have 2 cats and an old dusty house, you should have seen bagless container, gross! However, it's great to actually see all the dirt, hair and whatever get picked up. You know it's really working well. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for an affordable, quality vacuum."
1,Am I using the same vacuum as the other reviewers?? This is terrible!,"I just don't get all the positive reviews of this vacuum! I bought the vacuum about 6 months ago and it's given me nothing but trouble. Now granted, I am very demanding of my vacuums, in that I've got two inside dogs, one of which is a shepherd mix that sheds constantly. This vacuum is not up to the task in any way, shape or form, due to its apparently very poor design.The hose on the vacuum gets completely clogged within about two weeks of use, to where I have to run it under high-pressure water to get it cleaned out. I also have to clean the filters pretty much every time I use it. And on top of that, every time I use it, it blows dust and fine particles of hair everywhere! So much for the ""HEPA"" filter. My 15-year-old cheapie Hoover did a much better job than this vacuum."
1,bad vacuum,"I don't understand the good reviews for this vacuum. I bought this here on Amazon based on the positive feedback. Man, did I make a mistake. This vacuum was a huge disappointment! I have two cats, and expect a vacuum to work properly and suck up the hairs around the house. The main part did not work well. I had to use the hose the whole time. Also, cleaning this vacuum is a dusty nightmare. Buyers Beware!!!!"
3,Almost a 4 star product,I hoped that this would be the only vacuum I'd need. But I still have to use my older Panasonic on some rugs as the Bissell will actually pull the fibers out of my thick Indian carpet! Great for Industrial made rugs ONLY! It needs a variable setting that actually works. Also leaks dirt behind the dirt cannister. Time will tell how sturdy it is. And the tube connector to the motor is a poor design.As of 11/20/06 this item has started to lose suction.
5,Very nice,This is a very nice vacuum. Easy to use. I base my purchases on reviews and I bought it because it had high marks.
4,Incredibly Happy,i orgionally had bought a dyson and wasnt impressed with it so i saw this one. its amazing it cleaned up a ton of dirt that my OLD vacume and the dyson had missed. after cleaning my living room the dust cup was practically full. I had been using my older vacume for 2yrs on this carpeting. I put it together in now time and its light weight and easy to use. the turbo tool is awsome for i have two small dogs. the Vacume picks up big pieces of chewed up dog toys and small dirty alike. im very pleased with my purchase.
1,Do not buy!,"I have only had this vacuum for two years and it finally died today in a cloud of dust. Over these last two years, it has broken in one way or another at least four times. It sounds like a jet liner going off. The cannister gets clogged with hair and is hard to clean out. It tips over when you try to use the hose. It had wonderful suction for the first two months, but it was downhill from there. This vacuum is poorly made and I would not buy another one!"
4,Perfect for me,"I have a one bedroom apartment and the cord is so long I can vacuum the whole place without unplugging. It is very good and picked up dirt I did't even think was there! Altough, I accidentally hit a wall a little too hard and a belt slipped. The burning smell was lovely, but the belt was easy to fix."
4,Send In The Clowns.,"Includes songs from ""I Am What I Am"", ""All By Myself"" & ""The Music Never Ends"". These 3 albums have been compiled together frequently. In some tracks, Shirley sounds harsh... the songs lack the feeling and sensitivity. She simply belts out. Why?"
2,Far too wordy and lofty for an engineer,"Although Dr. Williams is an engineering genius, he has trouble laying out a clear and concise solution. I just took my first undergraduate dynamics class, and found it easier to teach myself the material rather than try and sift through all the confusing prose that Dr. Williams considers educational text.A good textbook contains the background (perhaps theory), procedure, and solved examples of problems to teach a student a particular technique of solving a problem. I found this book contains far too much background and theory and far too little of the straightforward solved examples.Although this may be a wonderfully written book for a graduate student or professor to ""brush-up"" on their knowledge, it lacks in its ability to start from scratch and actually lay out the fundamental technique. Dr. Williams has written this book with the MIT graduate student as his ideal reader."
5,Fantastic!!!!!,The Author's clear lucid descriptions enables you easily grasp some difficult concepts.A didactic gem!!!
4,very interesting,"It was very interesting and insightful reading about the intellectual origins of fascism, and how parts of the left have ironically adopted them. I especially found the sections about Bataille and Mussolini fascinating."
2,too sensitive,"The one I had previously (a freebie from a distributor) would light only if very close, this was useful if you have several wires to determine which ones are hot. This unit starts glowing 6 to 12 inches from a hot wire so it's impossible to discriminate which wires are hot."
5,Essential Siva,"This book is an absolute treasure trove of oral stories, written lore, poems, historical locations, temples, and writings on the 5000 year old God, Shiva, Lord of Destruction (obstacles). Its teachings are a MUST for any philosopher, saivite, any lover of God. Shiva represents the totality. Man and Woman. Birth and Death. This is an extensive read -very thick book. Covers everything. I highly recommend.OM SHREE GANESHAAYA NAMAH!OM NAMAH SIVAYA!"
4,"Great characters, good story","I have read all the Inspector Challis books and loved them all. The characters are well developed and interesting, the stories have unexpected twists and that is what makes this series fun."
4,Attach the pen!,"This is a neat travel toy for my son. He is only 16 months, but can still hold and draw on it pretty well! If only they would have attached the pen! Probably not a problem for an older child, but you know the little ones, when they are done with something it just gets dropped. Plus, for anyone using it, the pen holder, which is in middle of the fold, is too loose. Every time we put it away in his backpack it would fall through. We lost it lots of times during the course of our trip."
4,Great little book for light reading,A great little book for light reading that will appeal most to the golfer but will also have appeal to the non golfer.
4,Riveting mystery,"I am happy to say that I have found a mystery author that is as good as or better than MHC earlier novels. She Loves Me Not was a riveting read and the ending surprised me. I suspected many different people of being the Secret Admirer but I was wrong. Though I do enjoy putting the pieces together to figure out who-dun-it, I still appreciated the surprise. I have read a couple of Ms. Staub's other mysteries and have found them all to be hard to put down reading. They keep you up late at night trying to finish and prove your theory right (or wrong). Overall a great find!"
4,keeps you guessing,"I have read all of Wendy Corsi Staub's novels (excluding her latest-""Dearly Beloved"") and have enjoyed all of them. This one seemed to start a little slow, but it could have been just the fact that with a 9 mo. old I have little time to read, so it took me a while to get into it. Once I did though, it was a very good read. Every time something happens to Rose, Staub sets it up where it could be anyone in the book who is responsible, she makes sure that each character is ""busy"" or ""missing"" during the acts. She ""tricks"" you with each set-up and keeps you guessing. You do not know who it is until the end. I can't wait to read ""Dearly Beloved""."
5,What a great page turner!,"I started reading this book right before we left for vacation and had to bring it with me because I literally could NOT put it down. Made poor hubby drive all the way so that I could read! I loved how there were so many 'suspects' in the book, several times I was placing in my mind where all the men were at one time knowing that any one of them could be the killer. And the teaser chapter at the very end of this book .......I can't wait to read ""Dearly Beloved"".......I've already recommended this book to several people.....absolutely wonderful!"
5,You won't be able to put it down!,"This was a great book. It's the first one I've read by this author, but it won't be the last. I picked it up on a whim because the cover copy made reference to Mary Higgins Clark. I enjoyed this book more than hers. I thought the present tense style would bother me, but it really didn't. I think it made it more suspenseful."
3,ok....,The plot was good....very orginial. But the tense the story was written in was distracting. It was hard to feel drawn into the story. And the baby talk got very annoying....I figured out on the first page that her son was a small child - having to decipher baby talk through the whole book got old very quickly.
2,Disappointing Christie,"I am a fan of Christie's, but found this novel a bit of a let-down. It moves at the speed of a turtle in molasses, and though, at the time of writing I have not completed reading the book, the identity of the killer seems obvious (as it did from from the beginning). This is always a bit disappointing; one prefers to be surprised in the end. I feel that her story must have been fairly thin, so she felt the need to fill it up with pointless fillabuster-like dialogue and internal monologue. I would recommend one of her earlier, faster-paced novels instead of this one."
3,Clueless about the book.,"I read this book about 20 pages at a time every Sunday. Sunday's aren't exactly my cup of tea. It's the day after the weekend when I'm tired and sleep most of the day. What I read of the book I didn't really enjoy at all. British literature dosn't exactly make much sense to me. I don't understand some of it. Other parts are just so boring that I couldn't even tell you what I was reading. Perfect example: ""I am quite sure"" said Hercule Poirot"". ""When a thing arranges itself so, one realizes that it must be so, one only looks for reasons why it should be so. If one does not find the reasons why it should not be so, then one is strengthened in one's opinion."" This didn't make a bit of sense to me, and most of the book was like that."
3,a nice time killer,"This is one of Christie's easier mysteries to figure out but the murders are just nasty enough to be almost comical. The drowning of children shouldn't be funny but here, I think Agatha was in a dark, black comedy mood. Besides, the 2 victims are rather obnoxious... so it makes it more humorous. While you'll guess the whodunit right away (how can you not?), she does throw in a few twists at the end that only Poirot could have unravelled. Not a great book, but not bad either. After all, Christie did write it and she seldom wrote a bad story in her career. Good stuff, as one reader mentioned, to curl up with in autumn weather."
4,"GOod, but not her best","Like many of the other reviews, I did not find this as good as other Agatha Christies. It was boring at some parts, and it strayed from its main topic(Halloween party). I guessed the murderer right from the beginning. Read some other Christies. Most of them are really good."
3,Not her best,"This book does not show off Agatha Christie's finer points in her literature. It lacks that suspenseful twinge that makes me want to read it to see if my suspiscions of who the killer is are correct before it's too late. If you want to know what her writing's really all about, try The Mysterious Affair at Styles, her first Poirot mystery"
4,A MYSTERY THAT YOU HAVE TO REALLY THINK ABOUT!,"In Agatha Chritie's Halloween Party, you really have to try and figure out the physchology behind the mind of the killer. I think that if you are an open minded mystery reader, you will really enjoy this book; I know I did!!!!"
5,very good!,This book was great. The people who thought the end was confusing just aren't very smart. The characters were interesting and the ending was lovely!
2,Not one of her better books.,"I've read about 7 or 8 Poirot mysteries and this one just didn't impress me much. Character developlement was weak, plot was muddled, and the story lacked the intensity that I have seen in many of her other books. I found myself missing the excellent quality of her 20's and 30's mysteries. If your a big fan, you might as well read it but don't expect anything like The ABC Murders or The Mysterious Affair at Styles."
1,Clumsy mystery,"I certainly haven't read many of Christie's books (only about ten), and although I consider myself a lover of detective stories, I can never figure out who she will choose to be her killer. Every one of her books has stumped me. Except this one.It is so clear who the killer is in this book that, at the critical clue, I actually stopped reading and said to myself, ""Is she serious?"" I couldn't believe that Dame Agatha had created such a careless mystery. The necessary clues make themselves plainly obvious. Of course I couldn't figure out the whole picture before it was revealed (can anyone?), but I was absolutely certain about whodunnit.Even the character development in this is weak. Usually, she'll give us a couple of really interesting characters to enjoy and take in, but you'll be hard pressed to enjoy anyone other than Poirot and Oliver. Skip this one."
2,Hardcover?,The description clearly states this is hardcover. But the book that arrived is paperback. I'm disappointed as I would have preferred hardcover and thought that's what I was ordering.
4,Always a good read,"Readers can always count on Agatha Christie for a fun and interesting whodunit. In this 60's addition to the Hercule Poirot series, the intrepid detective is asked to help solve a murder which occurs during a Halloween party. Mrs. Ariadne Oliver, one of the party hostesses, requests Poirot's help in discovering who murdered a young girl at the party by holding her head underwater in the apple bobbing bucket. The girl had boasted that she had witnessed a murder and Poirot suspects that the murderer was trying to protect his identity by killing her. The detective does his usual thorough job of investigating and uses his superior logic to sort through the facts until he discerns who the murderer is. This is a good read, as always."
3,"A good book, but not one of Agatha Christie's best","I thought that Halloween Party was a very good book. Unfortunately, it started of slow, but it picked up the pace as I started to get to the end of the book. One reason why Agatha Christie is a famous author is because she has great character development in her books, and she expressed her strength in this novel. My favorite detective in Christie's stories' is a man named Hercule Poirot, who was the detective of this story. Christie makes Poirot so good that no real life detective can be anywhere close to as good as Poirot. I found it ironic that there was a character in the story who was also a detective fiction writer, like Christie. The kids try to give the author some ideas for another story. I recommend this book to you if you are a detective fiction fan."
3,Reading with Tequila,"Hallowe'en Party wasn't the best Agatha Christie novel, but it was far from the worst. Ariadne Oliver teams up with Hercule Poirot when a murder or possibly two, has been committed. While I loved the back and forth between Ariadne and Poirot and I love anything to do with Halloween, the mystery left something to be desired. Hallowe'en Party cast suspicion on the killer too obviously and too early. You didn't get to experience the usual surprising Poirot reveals the killer moment. A decent but ultimately unremarkable Christie novel."
4,Missing the personal touch,"I love Fall Guy, but I still miss her boyfriend and his wonderful German shepherd. Wish they'd get back together. The books had more sparkle and Rachel was less depressed."
2,Good idea but the book doesn't deliver,"It seems the author took the e-mails she received from people and without editing them published them in the book . There are lots of errors and mistakes . Some seem to be so summurized they have totally lost their effect . Overall I was very disappointed in this book . I stopped reading it when I reached the last 20 pages and picked up a much better book called ""Toxic Inlaws"" I recommed Toxic Inlaws to anyone having inlaw problems like me ."
1,Horriible,"This book is a published collection of grammatical errors. If you want an example of how not to write a book, please read this.The stories are negative and seem to be a collection of complaints. The women explain how their husbands need to stand up their mothers , but most of them don't and clearly get divorced. There is no humor and no valuable suggestions. Maybe I should get this comment published!"
2,Not a miracle,"This product did not do anything for me that I could notice. They have you taking an insanely amount of pills 30minutes before your meals. I followed the directions exactly and have been watching what I've eaten. My cravings have not gotten any better and I have not felt any more energy than usual. I would not recommend this product again but Natures Secret is not a bad company. I purchased 15-Day Weight Loss Cleanse & Flush through them from Amazon and found it to help me more, with more regular bowel movements and slight energy increase."
2,Kindle edition flawed,"I bought the Kindle edition of this text for a class and have quickly discovered some flaws in this edition. They are easily seen in the sample of chapter 1. Figures 1-2 through 1-4 are supposed to be graphs showing sin(x), cos(x), and sin(x) and cox(x) on the same plot, but they all show sin(x) in the Kindle edition. From the sample of the print edition, it appears to be correct. It just makes me wonder what other errors the Kindle edition contains if something that simple is wrong."
2,Inconsistent,"I was unhappy with these scales and returned them. They were not consistent. If I stepped off and on them several times, the weight was often 2 to 3 pounds different. I was careful to make sure that I had my weight on the scales in the same place each time. I tried them for several weeks and the inconsistency continued."
5,Still working two years later!,"Yep, it's still working. If you just want a scale to weigh yourself then you should be fine with this one."
5,1958 La Traviata,This is possibly the best La Traviata Maria Callas sang. The sound quality is much better than in the 1955 recording Alfredo Kraus is in excellent voice with great control in the duets with Callas. The recording I received is in excellent condition.
2,a boring movie,"this movie is a triumph of cliche: the plot is one you've seen so many times before that you can't believe anyone would flog it one more time(a road/buddie movie where the leads are of opposite temperament and gender, and end up (surprise! ) entangled). the characters are similarly stereotyped: the blonde-next-door sweetheart, the befuddled, bewildered, stodgy male, the whore with the heart of gold who sets him free (to return to his sweetheart as a wiser and deeper man). the dialogue,the situations,the plot twists, are all so predictably stale that you're not sure if you've wandered into some three-digit channel at 3am. the basic fallacy behind this movie is the ""what do you do with a dead horse?"" answer: ""pump him up with air and he'll float."""
2,"when nature calls, you resond with FORCE","Do you remember when that woman in tie dye puts up her left leg in that one tide commercial??? That's EXACTLY what this whole movie is like. Sandra Bullock, as usual, put up a very strong performance, but Ben Affleck (who in this movie was KINDA HEAVY AND NOT TOO SWEET) was a weak point. But anyway, back to the Tide analogy. So in the commercial, the woman gives a little scream, sways back and forth, looks like she's going to be sick, and then instead pulls a rabbit out of the dryer. Just like this movie because it's not that good until the end, and then JUST LIKE A MAGIC TRICK it all works out in the end. Still overall, I would call this a weak movie that should best be avoided.... unless you use tide and love rabbits like ME!!!!!"
1,Forces of Nature,"A good cast but appaling film. It was unbelievable and predictable, I fast forwarded most of it. I mean, who has a weding in a middle of a tornado? Who gets their purse stolen and immediately goes on a shopping spree afterwards? it is said to be a romantic comedy, although nothing was funny apart from the stupidity of it, and there was hardly any romance. This is one of the worst movies Ive seen and i advise anyone with sense NEVER to see it."
3,good chemistry,"The best part of this movie is how much fun the two leads seem to be having together. It's a rom-com with more on it's mind and that's always a good thing. I hesitate to call it unpredictable, that would be too big a description but surprising and not formulaic. So all in all entertaining."
4,Holds up against similar movies.,"This romantic comedy is in the same vein as It Happened One Night, The Out of Towners and Planes, Trains and Automobiles. It is the most similar to It Happened One Night, in trying to decide on marriage. Things were a lot more clear in that age. The parents in this comedy are great too. I am a Sandra Bullock fan, she is good in this part. I mean it is modern times and you don't have to get hysterical. I believe it was ingenious some of the plot twists they chose. It is not slow moving or boring, very entertaining. Feel free to email me with questions or comments."
4,Funny!,"Ben (Ben Affleck) was on his way to attend his own wedding when his plane skidded out of control. He met Sarah (Sandra Bullock) on the plane. They decided to hitch a ride together, posing as a couple on honeymoon. This trip was not as smooth as they had predicted because they met with uncountable comic unnatural disasters. The ending was not what I have thought but it was still nice.This movie will make you laugh till you roll off your seats."
2,A waste of time and talent,"Affleck and Bullock play mismatched travelers to Savannah, Georgia; he, to his wedding, and she, well, she has her reasons. The two have zero chemistry together; Steve Martin and John Candy had a lot more in the similar-themed Planes, Trains, and Automobiles (1987), which was a lot funnier as well. Even a scene where Affleck dances in a gay bar, which has potential for laughs, falls flat. At least Steve Zahn, as Affleck's best man, is funny. A waste of time and talent."
3,Forces of Sandra Bullock,"You will want to watch this film all the way through. Sandra Bullock is great as a free-spirited girl who is thrown together with Ben Affleck who is on his way to be married. A series of mishaps (""nature""). keeps them together through most of the story. It's one of those love-hate movies. You love Sandra and Ben together, being alternately funny and serious. You hate the fact that he goes on to marry the girl who has absolutely no character development in the plot. And then they get preachy about how marriage is ""safer"" than being single. No kidding. For the great acting of Sandra Bullock and the fun scenes with Affleck, you might watch it again."
3,"mediocre, like all of sandy's recent movies","Frankly, she needs better material because she's better than these boring films she's making. This was a very forgettable story about a free spirit who is charming and causes ripples all aorund her."
3,It's not Ben's and Sandra's Best,"The Movie was very very funny, the theme was great, the actingwas great, but the ending ruined the whole movie. But if you just wanta good laugh this the movie for you."
1,horrible!,This is one horrible movie. I even gave it a second chance thinking I may have missed something. It's just as bad the 2nd time.
2,not a good movie,"forces of nature is a movie that just isn't very good. The plot seems ok at first but as the movie progresses it doesn't really build up to an anticipated climax. The relationship between Bullock and Affleck is forced and does not come naturally. It seems as if there is not much passion or forbidden love between the two the way the movie builds it up to be. I think Affleck made the right choice at the end though, because the girl he chose was prettier and seemed like she would be more stable and faithful to her man."
1,Lousy,"I have a beautiful home theatre which I spent over$50,000.00 on. I was so excited that I didnt care what movie I put on, so I let my wife choose. Big mistake! It was absolutely boring and I thought the actors went together as well as Matter and Anti-Matter. I thought it was so bad that I dont even want to talk about it anymore!"
3,Mediocre Romantic Comedy!,"This film is badly written and badly directed. Sandra Bullock overacts and just seems to be having fun instead of acting. Ben Affleck seems to be aware that he made a career mistake and it shows. Absolutely no chemistry between the two leads, and an unsatisfying ending, but taking into consideration the lack of chemistry maybe it is appropriate. OK movie but lots of flaws. Nice 'weather' imagery and some funny moments. Ultimately entertaining if not a bit too long. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film a 5!"
2,"It's been done better, before.","Shy away from this one unless you're a serious Affleck or Bullock fan. The plot is basically a recycled version of the Steve Martin/John Candy 1987 movie Planes, Trains, and Automobiles. If you're interested in a good travel-hishaps movie, do yourself a favor and check out the original."
3,Movie was pretty flat,"My daughter and I watched this movie together. We found the humor a little flat. The story message is good and I liked the ending. Ben and his fiance obviously liked each other. There's always going to be a ""Sarah"" in everyone's life that didn't get experienced. Sarah represents exciting irresponsible experiences. Ultimately, we all have to return to reality and enjoy the gifts that come with it."
4,TO FIND AND TO PROTECT A REAL LOVE IS SO HARD,I LIKED IT TOO MUCH.I ENJOYED AND LAUGHED.ACCORDING TO THE BAD DAYS WE LIVE BECOUSE OF THE EARTHQUAKE I FELT MYSELF HAPPY.
4,A nice romantic comedy,"The best of this film is the cast. Sandra is funny as usual, but the best are Maura Tierney and David Strickland (in his last role on a film before his young death). If you like romantic comedies, this is a very good option. Nice special effects too. I will certainly buy it."
3,No consequences?,"Forces of Nature starts out as a fun romantic comedy, but as much fun as it was to watch Ben Affleck and Sandra Bullock have a good time, I couldn't help being disapointed with Ben Affleck's character. Both he and his fiancée, Maura Tierney were tempted to cheat on each other, except Ben's fiancée's conscience holds her back, while only timing holds back Ben. I felt bad for Maura Tierney's character. She trusted her fiancée and he let her down, and yet there was a happy ending for all. Well, all but those watching the film."
1,One of the worst movies of the last 10 years,"How anyone can truly enjoy this movie is beyond me. There is absolutely NO chemistry between Affleck and Bullock. Bullock comes across as completely fake and unbelievable. The screenplay is horrendous. Affleck's acting leaves much to be desired. The plot is ridiculous, especially since the ending of the movie goes completely against the set up of the movie. Also, are people really so stupid as to stay outside in a hurricane? They've known it was coming to town for three days! If you haven't seen this movie - believe me - you've missed nothing at all."
2,A complete mess!,"Forces of Nature is probably my least favorite film of Sandra Bullock's career. There's nothing wrong with her performance, she is funny and brilliant as always but to me Ben Affleck's wooden acting ruined this so-so film. There are parts of this film I like and parts I do not. The film has a week premise and never takes float, the ending is disappointing and the writing is sloppy. If you want a great Sandra Bullock film then check out 28 Days or Practical Magic, leave this one on the shelf."
4,"Good movie, mediocre DVD","Unlike those who would've liked Ben to end up with Sarah, I liked the ending (he was finally honest with himself about his fears, he overcame the obstacles to be with the one he loves). But I agree the ending was sudden - his inner struggle didn't come through clearly.The DVD isn't great - image isn't very high quality, and there's no commentary. But the deleted scenes and featurette are a nicefeature."
1,Not his best,I am surprised at how many people like this album compared to his other solo albums as I dont like the 'bitty' jazz feel to this compared to the more rocky feel to eg.Hard Wired. Some moments are good and there actually are a couple tracks which dont just dissapear into an off the wall brandon fields sax solo and the less said about the one with his daughter on vocals the better... Dont get me wrong I am a big Weckl fan but I somehow feel his best days are gone.
5,Weckl is the man,"I really dig Perp. Motion and like the fusion/latin stuff he's moved more toward. In a way, despite the added horns, some of this new stuff with the enhanced synthesizer presence reminds me of ""Hard Wired"" with Jay Oliver. The odd time jam (track 6)is cool, not to mention all his soloing over the bass/keyboards vamps throughout the CD. The final track blows me away. I would have liked to have heard a little more riding on his stacked mini-china on this CD as he has on past releases. Also, I thought parts of the opening track might have sounded cool if he ""swung"" the beat rather than riding eighth notes on the aux hi-hat..... but who the hell am I to talk??? The drumming is his best yet in my opinion, but I personally prefer the overall musical style of ""Transition"" just a little more."
5,Huge Dave Weckl Fan,"I have been a dave weckl fan since his first cd master plan and I got to tell you, this guy is like fine wine, he gets better with time. He is so far ahead of himself it's unbeliveable, and this last cd(perpetual motion) proved that without a dout. So keep up the good work Dave and tell tom keep those fucnky bass lines grooving."
3,"A good, short, nuts and bolts approach.","This was my first time reading about travel writing and it was a quick, easy read. Good practical suggestions. Geared more to travel fluff than to travel literature, but that's okay... we need to learn how to do it all."
5,It's GORGEOUS!,This is a beautiful goblet. It has an elegant look and feel. A great gift idea at a reasonable price.
3,safe but heavy/awkward...,"I bought this lock based on a review I'd read elsewhere saying it took over 3 hours to break through, and since I just bought a new bike, an expensive bike... I didn't want to take aaaaany chances of it getting stolen. The GOOD part about this lock is it IS wicked strong, durable, seems it'd be a pain-in-the-behind to cut so I feel thieves would be deterred. The BAD parts are: 1. the base part only fits one way onto the U-bar (so use something to identify how it lines up!)... 2. the base part is hard to get back onto the U-bar, it's finicky, to say the least... and 3. it's wicked heavy!!! Don't expect to hang this on your handlebar and go for a ride. I have to carry it in a backpack, and after about 20 mins I start to feel it. :-( *I'm only 5'4"" and 106lbs."
3,So %$&^ing heavy and awkward!,"Like you're probably doing now, I read a lot of the reviews that mentioned the weight of this thing and how big it was and didn't really care because I wanted a great lock. Not to beat a dead horse or anything, but it is so freaking heavy and awkward! It does exactly what it is supposed to, and I'm pretty sure you'd need a cutting torch to break through this thing, but it is a giant hassle to transport when not in use. I have a Crosstrail by Specialized and this lock won't fit anywhere on the bike, including the cross section where you normally store a lock. I would really recommend checking one of these out at your local bike shop and getting a feel for it before you purchase one online."
3,"tough, but fragile","This lock is strong and dependable- as long as you treat it gingerly. While the u-lock bar is thick enough to deter 95% of thefts, the plastic casing over the lock device very easily shatters. I'm not sure whether this affects the integrity of the lock itself, but if I were to go back I would get a kryptonite instead."
1,not able to unlock,don't waste your money on this one...not reliable. not able to unlock it which is not ideal when you are away from home after biking few hours...
5,Great lock,"Very legit bike lock. I live in a bigger city and definitely need the best protection for my bike. I didn't want to splurge on an expensive kryptonite lock and went with this one instead. It's very solid and I'm satisfied with it. It's a little bigger than I thought it would be, but that's fine with me given how well it works."
4,"So far so good, but what's up with the lack of packaging?","So my husband and I ordered two of these, one for each of our bikes. They came, and well one of them had no packaging on it at all. It looked like it had been a return or something, because the keys were thrown in the box - not attached to the lock, and there was no packaging on the one lock at all. Seemed a little strange, because the other one had original packaging and everything on it. It didn't appear to be used - no scratches, marks etc. They did come in time, and were packaged so that they couldn't be damaged.However, since everything seemed to be included, we decided to use it, and so far, so good. We combine this lock with a cable lock on our bikes, and then intertwine both bikes and the 4 locks together, and hopefully it will continue to deter thieves.I would recommend, but am a little weirded out that one didn't come in packaging...."
3,Weighs more than my bike,The lock works perfectly i haven't had a single problem with the mechanics of the lock. I like the various types of keys they give you. I just hate how heavy it is. I have to carry a backpack just to carry the lock.
4,very strong,"the U bar is Very strong, but as others say the casing is plastic. I dropped mine a few times and it cracked at the end, but the lock tumbler and lock mechanics all work perfectly."
4,Humorous and a Great Read,"My good friend was clearing out some of her old books and gave me this book to read. I have never got around to reading any of Mr. Ludlum's books, so this novel was a first for me. I enjoyed the book and I found it to be a very entertaining read. I always appreciate a bit of humor in stories and this book had a number of humorous moments. I laughed at some of the scenes and kept reading and laughed at the characters.I understand that there is a sequel to the book so I'll probably ask my friend if she has it. Assuming she can remember the title. In my opinion, ""The Road to Gandolfo"" is a great read and I would highly recommend it."
1,no fun,"After reading the reviews on how funny this book is, I could'nt wait to pick it up....what a let down. Ludlum is brilliant, but he's no comedian. One of the few books I did'nt bother to finish."
2,Not very funny or very good,"This is Ludlums attempt at writing a comedy. It isn't very funny or entertaining. These two characters go through a series of adventures that aren't interesting. The big running joke is that one character can never get anything to eat. How funny is that? There is also an embarrassing, juvenile storyline about one of the characters prowess with women and his beautiful wives. It is like a low class Matt Helm story (which is already at rock bottom). Ludlum is good at creating a superspy and writing action sequences. That could easily be twisted in a funny, entertaining way. But Ludlum does not leverage his strenghts here."
4,Interesting and enjoyable,This book was a very pleasant surprise. It's not the usual Robert Ludlum but instead a light entertaining read. The characters are funny but lean towards unrealistic. It is very difficult to believe that the characters can maintain the same forceful personalities throughout the entire book throughout all circumstances. It ended nicely without a rushed feeling and also avoiding seeming like all the ends got tied up in the last chapter. A very readable book even though it lacked the fast pace and did not have the level of suspense of other Ludlum books.
3,A different side of Ludlum,"Robert Ludlum takes a stab at comedy and comes away successful. The Hawk is a wildly entertaining character. This is a quick and quality read. The ending is a little lame, but most Ludlum endings are far fetched, so this is par for the course."
4,The Hawk is awsome!,"Ludlum spins a hailarious tale of suspense, intrugue and rediculous situations. ""The Hawk"" is a larger than life character who is a little more ""hands on"" than Army Generals are today. His exploitation of a young Boston lawyer to do his bidding in his quest for revenge for being cashired from the Army by a bunch of ""Pricky Shits"" in the Pentagon. ""The Hawk's"" use of his spectacular ex wives to motivate our lawyer in providing the leagalese and funding for the insane idea you can kidnap the Pope, and get away with it, is a most entertaining romp."
4,Very unusual but enjoyable,"This isn't the best novel I have ever read in this genre, but it's worth reading. It was funny and irreverent... check it out."
4,Robert Ludlum writes comedies!!!,"This is the first of two comedies written by the the author that doesn't show much humor in his better known books. The humor is unusual and enjoyable. I just wish I hadn't read the sequal,Road to Omaha, first."
3,ignore the above review,"Although Dorfman's views of the years of dictatorship are driven as much by emotion and opposition as they are by fact, his book about the Pinochet regime and the subsequent human rights trial serves as an interesting document to the chilean experience of dictatorship.The true extent of the horrors that occured in Chile may never be fully known but Dorfman's book about his experience of the dictatorship and his emotions as a Chilean is an essential document to the Chilean healing process.Some of the passages are extremely well written and the end of the book in particular raises some intersting questions.There are without question finer books concerning the period, but this is the most emotional work available and Dorfman's lament for Chile is at times very powerful."
2,Emotional but,This is informative only for someone who has slept through the past 3 decades. It starts out promising as a personal account but never goes beyond that.
4,A good synopsis of the trial of Pinochet,"One should keep in mind that this is a personal and political view of the Pinochet case. The book is good in the fact that it is a personal account of a man who had friends who are among the disapeared of Chile. If you are interested in a personal account than by this book, however if you are interested in an acccount of Pinochet policies by a book exclusivly about his regime."
1,point of information - German title,"if seeking the German DVD release of this film at amazon.de, search under the German title 'Sch?ner Gigolo, armer Gigolo'. That DVD, which has different timings from the Australian release, offers both the German-language and the English-language versions of the film. Of course, it's region 2, meaning that customers in the US and Canada will need a multi-region DVD player to view it."
1,Fire Got To This Print.....,"As mentioned in the inside liner notes for this release, the print that was used was salvage from a fire, and then mastered for this release, parts are strangely bright and scenes with Dietrich were cut abruptly. Although the film is a letterbox version, I cannot recommend this copy. It seems Amazon Germany now as another release that looks promising, well there goes more money to burn!"
3,Okay entry in this series!,"This one is okay for it's genre. Nothing special but a good supporting cast including J. Carrol Naish, H.B. Warner and Anthony Quinn helps. A short running time of 58 minutes won't put you to sleep either. Originally a Paramount release, this is a Congress Films reissue or TV print (probably a dupe at that!) and like most of Alpha's product, it leaves something to be desired. At least it looks like the source material was film rather than VHS tape. If you like the Bulldog Drummond series, you'll probably find this one entertaining."
1,A worth seeing film but NOT in such poor condition,"Like almost every film from sources like this, this one is of extremely poor quality in every respect and will give a poor impression of its true quality. Do yourself a favour, put it on your ""to see"" list, and wait for a quality DVD with adequate sound and good picture."
2,THIS is Noel Coward?,"Cavalcade has not aged well; it's difficult to believe this was the best picture winner of 1933. Alternately stilted and maudlin, frequently jingoistic, it hardly bears any resemblance to the witty and brittle Noel Coward we're used to. It also seems a filmed play rather than a work intended for the screen.The one thing the film has going for it is its evocation of period, but then, 1933 wasn't so very far away from the historical events depicted in the movie. The little musical hall styled vignettes seem authentic enough.This isn't a gloriously restored print but it's adequate. At times the syncing between sound and mouth movements is a little off- it's best not to watch their lips too carefully.There's a good reason this is one of only two Oscar best picture winners not released on a region 1 disc."
1,not in the correct format for my DVD so not able to view,I would really love a copy that I could play but never heard of PAL format. IT did not work.
1,Terrible Vacuum,"I've owned this vacuum for 2 years now, but I didn't get carpeting for my apartment until May of 2006, so it wasn't used heavily until then.The vacuum lost suction in less than a year and I have to clean the rollers every time I vacuum. It also ""regurgitates"" all the dust, creating another mess for me to clean.I'm shopping around for a high-powered vacuum that's reasonably priced. Can't wait till I get rid of this junk."
1,The little vacuum that couldn't,"I have had this vacuum over a year now, and I hate it.One of the first things I noticed was that the motor wasn't powerful enough to keep the roller spinning over carpet. The roller stops if the carpet level changes any. Within the first month the roller broke and I paid $17 to replaced it. It still gets caught on carpet. Not only that but it doesn't fully sweep in a track. By that I mean you can see the lines where it misses. You have to go over, and over, and over to get everything up.It's also very heavy. The tubes are way too short and the hose pops off all the time. The filters get clogged awfully fast and I have to wash them every 5 vacuumings. The suction spits kitty litter out the back. It's loud and noisy. The cord is too short.The whirlwind action in the receptacle cup doesn't work and dirt flies up into the filter clogging it. Just the other day the carpet height level mechanism completely broke off!!I just simply despise this vacuum."
1,Don't waste your money!,"I've had this vacuum for one year and had to replace the roller brush 4 times! The 1st 3 I got free from the company and the last I had to buy for $25. They claim the roller is not covered under the warranty. The roller will seize up and melt after about 3 months, the last one I got has lasted me one month. I will NEVER buy another Bissell product again. There customer service stunk and when I took it to an authorized dealer he told me thats what happens when it picks up hair.... uh, duh it's a vacuum, what is it supposed to be picking up... fairy dust? Don't waste your time or money on this hunk of junk! I just went out and bought a Hoover, I hope I have better luck."
1,Meltdown,"This vacuum seemed to be a great deal when I bought it, First thing went was the belt, you can smell it burning. I figured thats OK since it a wear out item. Next the side of the roller started to burn, and smelled up the whole house. I figures I would buy a roller but when I opened the bottom, the roller assembly was also burned, so you could not put another roller in it. I just put it the trash. Didn't bother calling Bissel."
1,Essentially Useless after 6 months use.,"I would not buy this vacuum if I had to do it again. I had the same problem that other customers reported with the roller getting stuck. Even after checking to make sure there is no hair caught up in it, it still doesn't budge. I went over a carpet patch where there was a small but visible ball of dog hair lying loose on top of the carpet and even after going back and forth over it MANY times not a single bit of it was picked up by this vacuum. Plus, each time I use it I spend(waste) an absurd amount of time cleaning every filter, the roller and even unscrewing the base to clean it out = hoping it will result in greater suction but the performance has still been declining since the first use. These are the reasons this vacuum is cheap, but if it only lasts for six months before losing all suction I think you'd get more for your money by saving up for a more expensive vacuum that lasts."
5,One of the most beautiful books I have the pleasure to own...,"My first copy of God Calling was used. Since it arrived, this simple devotional book has become a vital part of my daily spiritual readings. I was looking for a used copy in good condition to give as a gift when I saw this 'enhanced' version and I ordered it on a whim. I'm so glad that I did. This version is almost as beautiful on the outside as the inspirational messages contained within! Although it is so beautifully crafted, it feels like treating yourself to 'sinfully delicious chocolate', I've decided that I'll keep this version and make a gift of my plain version."
5,AWESOME!,This is a great journal. Book looks as if it had never been touched. Part of my daily devotional. It's great!
1,Inspirational? Inspired by whom?,"""What if you could have a conversation with Jesus Himself? What would He say to you?""Yes, What if! But if so, how can we tell it is Jesus speaking and not a fallen angel masquerading in light?If you want to ""hear"" the Word of God, the Word Himself, read the Bible. Jesus said ""He who has ears"" will hear. He also said to be cautious of words that ""tickle the ear"".Skip this ""fluff devotional"" full of ""feel good stuff"". Read the Word itself.If one considers this book ""inspired"", then any book out there can be considered the ""inspired word of God"" and we are left with no authoratative word. Christians should be cautious in reading this book."
5,One of the best!,"This is an exceptional book. I have been faithfully reading it's daily messages for over 10 years now and they are always fresh. Each day the message speaks right to your heart, in the place where you are. It's amazing and wonderful. I have given it to all my family and friends and will continue to share this treasure with everyone I know."
5,God Calling,"It is an absolutely beautiful book! I even ordered one for a friend, who in turn says she is thoroughly enjoying it!"
5,Bill Moreno,"This is a ""Fantastic"" book to read through out the year, I've been reading this book at least 3 years and I feel Christ talking directley to me when I read each days writing. I read the Bible to learn Gods word, and read this and hear Jesus talking to me, helping me with each days struggles. I highly recommend it to everyone."
1,Not a Christian Book,"Anyone who claims to be hearing from, and writing, the words of Christ, is either a psychopath, or a prophet. You can't know which one this person is. So the only safe thing is to believe they are a psychopath. Which they probably are. Avoid this deceptive book."
3,God Calling - Deluxe Hard Cover,"Disappointing. I bought this as a gift for someone because the book itself is great. I was very frustrated to find that the classy leather-bound cover had a tacky paper barcode & price stuck on the back cover which, when pulled off, ripped, leaving bits of paper & glue which I then had to scratch off. It still has a sticky patch which I've now got to remove with a product that I hope won't leave a mark. Not happy."
5,Review of the God Calling Journal,"The God Calling Journal is an excellent way to increase the daily interaction in spiritual living. The readings inspire peace, growth and continual learnng. This journal is a wonderful addition to any collection and is sure to be a favorite."
5,Best devotional I've ever read (and I've read several),"This is truly and amazing book. It was transcribed, not written, by the ""Two Listeners,"" who sat together regularly, prayed together, and wrote what they heard. The result is a marvelous collection of inspiring, comforting and educational passages written from the perspective of Jesus.If you like Emmet Fox, but don't like the godlessness of many New Thought perspectives, you'll enjoy this. :-) I can't recommend it enough."
1,not a functional devotional,"Why do they keep messing with God Calling??? My old little hard cover (1953)is precious to me; I underline, put in dates relevant to the message and my own Scripture references. This book is meant to put be away with grandma's gilded family Bible. It is a padded hardcover with gold-edged pages; you can't write on the slick pages and if there were any room they fill it with scrolls, curly-q's, added Scripture (don't need that, have my own Bible-several), poetry (??), thoughts to consider (again, I have my own), and then they tell you what to pray. Seriously?? What was simple and sincere, they have made an embellished, pompous and useless book, unless, of course, you want that kind of thing: beauty over function. Certainly not the gift for I intended for a male friend. I don't even want it."
5,God Calling by A. J. Russell,"This is an amazing book - spiritual, poetic, life-changing. I have bought 6 of them to give to friends after a friend gave one to me. I will continue to give them as long as they are available."
5,Amazing.,"This book is amazing.I do not care if these words came to these women or someone just sat down and wrote them. Thesewords are words to live by.You can read it over and over and be aware of something new each time. The messages will come to you throughout your day, and you will remember them ,to help you live a better live."
4,Blessed..........,"I am blessed by the devotions in God Calling. Pleased to find this book on Amazon at such a good price. And, thank you for your good service and fast shipment."
4,God Calling,I have purchased several copies of this book (from various places) Keep a copy with you and read in it daily. It brings me peace and assurance daily and has helped get me through some trying times. Great gift for anyone - also seeGod Calling Music
4,God Calling Devotional,"This devotional is wonderful. I purchased some for some friends and all were very excited. However, one of them was misprinted and the entiremonth of March was missing, which was disturbing."
5,I thought it was just a journal in which one wrote.,"No, no, no. It is a daily journal that one reads! At first I started highlighting inspirational phrases, then realised there was more highlighted than not! It seemed to pertain to everyday life and situations, and each day I looked forward to picking it up to read the inspiration for that day. It is marvellous!Jacqueline WilliamsEdmonds WA"
5,God Calling,"Each page has a profound message. No matter what the situation, I am comforted and inspired. Following the suggestion of A. J. Russell, I have purchased this book for friends and aquaintances."
1,Beware! It's Magic,"I bought and read this book. I found it mesmerizing and very magical. However, this book is not of God. These two listeners ""channel"" a spirit to deceive the readers to think they are hearing from God."
1,I have great concerns,"What struck me odd at the beginning of this book is statement, that writings in the book are not verbally inspired. And at the same time they write in first person meaning it is Jesus Himself speaks. So it is: ""Thus saith the LORD..."". How it can be not inspired?""Jesus Calling"" was inspired by this book. It is full of Scriptures. That's makes it different, more useful.And why meditate on something that is not inspired?Other reviewer said right: meditate on inspired Word of GOD. You won't be duped, 100% guarantee."
1,NOT THE COMPLETE TEXT!,"I give God Calling 5 stars. I'm giving Barbour Publishing, and any other publisher that is printing edited down versions of this book 1 star or less. I have a paperback edition that was printed by Jove Books in 1978. I just got a new hardcover edition printed by Barbour in 2000. I was going to throw out my tattered paperback, but I did a coursory comparison of a couple entries and discovered the new Barbour hardback entries all had entire paragraphs removed. And from a spritual point of view, they were VERY IMPORTANT paragraphs. Upon investigating, MANY of them have had sentances and paragraphs removed. You're better off going to a book store, and looking for an edition that that says ""this book contains the complete text of the original hard cover..."". The passages have completely new meanings when you read the full text as God intended. Whoever decided to edit this down should be ashamed of themselves."
5,My Lifeline,"I came across this book by accident at the bookstore. There it sat, one lonely copy with an intriguing title. The daily words of inspiration seemed to speak directly to me. With uncanny precision it has constantly provided me with support during difficult as well as happy times in my life. After owning this book for 4 years and reading it daily, I now know that it was no accident that the only copy left at the bookstore was meant for me. Buy this book....I doubt you will ever regret it."
5,A Recipe for Spiritual Growth,"I read this little book for the first time in 1978 when it was presented to me by a friend. It then remained tucked away and forgotten until recently when I began searching for spiritual comfort, growth, and guidance. How powerful it still is! I didn't just find it something to soothe my hurts. I found it to be challenging and downright confrontational on occasion. I needed that!The ""two listeners"" are not psychics, but two women wished to share with others some of the lessons God taught them in their journey together with Him.As a means of deepening my daily devotionals, I have chosen to use a concordance and my Bible to locate the scriptures which deal with the daily topics. The ""Two Listeners"" CAN be validated by scripture. I would challenge their skeptics to use God's Word for proof."
5,There's nothing like it.,"This book lasts a lifetime because each year that I read a passage for that day, the words carry a new meaning, seeming to to never have been read before. It's amazing."
3,take time to choose,"I bought 4 books to give as gifts. I wished I spent more time reviewing the printed versions of the same book. I could have purchased a hardback version, on better paper, at a better price. Thanks ."
5,"Love it, Love it, Love it.....","I had a paperback copy of this book, and it really helped me to grow closer to God. So, I bought the journal..one for myself and a couple as birthday gifts for my friends. If you are searching for a closer walk...this book will help you find it..."
5,God Calling Devotional Journal,"I have been reading God Calling ever since the early 1970's. This book has helped me to know God in a personal way. I have given many copies away as gifts and worn out 3 paperbacks. I just received the Devotinal Journal and will now write in it along with my meditations. Every person I have given God Calling to has found peace, joy and guidance in their spiritual life and thanked me for introducing this timely book to them."
4,Good,"I like this daily book, I've been useing this for a couple years along with a daily bible I've currently added. This is a great way to start the day!!"
5,I read this a long time ago,"This book was passed on to me many years ago. I've read it off and on for twenty something years and always find it new each time I pick it up. I thought it was out of print by now, but recently ran across it on Amazon, deciding to send it to a friend who was hurting in life trials and tribulations. I started reading it again finding I was the one who needed it now.It's a daily word book, written to two women from God. A long time ago I thought it applied to my life when I was forty years old. Now, at 60 plus I find it still applies, but this time I'm going to try hard to live by it's 'calling'. Recommended to everyone who's trying to figure out their life."
5,God Calling,"This daily devotional is the one I use consistently. Each day, a concise, inspirational message is delivered in minimal words, making it easy to adopt this into your routine. I've found peace in the reading of this book, and have kept it as a part of my days for almost two decades. My recent order of several books was actually a 'replacement' order as several of my friends and family have worn theirs out."
3,Good Book...BUT.....,"The book is very inspirational, however, it leads readers to believe that the book is inspired by God. The book writes as if it is God's perspective and words, when it is really two listeners receiving messages. I found that kind of disturbing when I was reading and constantly had to remind myself that these are not God's words. I would recommend it to read because it is inspirational, but use your judgement, and know that these words are not from God but are from two ordinary people. This book should not be an excuse not to read the bible, as those words are from Jesus and are reliable."
5,It Creates A Mood,"There are certain times when one's soul needs to be bathed in soothing atmosphere. Rock N Roll or even moderate jazz just will not due. In cases of total relaxation, Dan Gibson's Great Lakes Suite is the perfect antitdote to stress and gets me a peaceful even heavenly mood.Its certainly quite relaxing to hear water trickling with the natural sounds of birds in the background. The transition to water gushing over Niagara Falls changes the mood to a even more ellaborate texture. Stress seems to ooze out of my body and it causes much peaceful reflection. A natural cure all to those trying times."
1,"Cheap, Cheap, Cheap!","My 3 1/2 year old son learned what the word ""cheap"" means when we bought this toy for him recently. It started falling apart as I was taking it out of the box. The thing wouldn't stay together. We exchanged it for Hasbro's Junior version of the Millennium Falcon that is built much more durable and comes with junior action figures, which I highly recommend."
2,DON'T BUY THIS WITHOUT READING,"I just bought this toy for my 5 year old son who is a huge Star Wars fan. He loves it although it does tend to fall apart. But here is the kicker: after seeing it online and at Toys-R-Us for around $50, I found it at the clearance display at my local Wal-Mart for $2.50. That's right--$2.50! They had over a dozen, along with a bunch of other Star Wars Trilogy stuff from last year. When I asked the clerk why these were $2.50, she said they were told to clear out all of last year's Star Wars stuff to make room for the new toys coming out for the new movie in May 2005. So shop around first before plunking down big bucks."
1,Very disappointing!,"Our 7 year old son purchased this toy after saving up his birthday money. $50 is an expensive toy for a 7 year old, but he decided that it was worth it. After all, the TIE fighter his brother bought with his birthday money has been a great toy.Unfortunatly, the Millennium Falcon did not live up to his (or our) expectations. Almost immediately after putting it together, we realized that there was a problem. Anything that was supposed to open wouldn't stay closed. Parts were literally falling apart every time the toy was moved.Long story short, within the first hour of opening the box, the toy had gone back into the box and my son had written a letter to Hasbro outlining his disappointment. The next day we returned the toy to the store for a refund.The good news is that our son learned a life lesson- things are not always what they look like on the box. The bad news is that other people might actually waste their money on this sorry toy."
2,Not worth the money,"I bought this toy for my son for Christmas. As soon as I started helping him put it together, I could tell it was a piece of junk. Everything you touch falls off. The landing gear can't even support the weight of the ship. The gun constantly falls off. It's nice to look at, but if your child expects to play with it-don't buy it."
1,VERY disappointing,"What a piece of junk. My 4 1/2 son has been begging for this ship. How disappointing it was for my husband and I to explain why Santa gave him a broken toy. None of the pieces stayed on. My 2 1/2 son wanted it also. We thought it would be too old for him. So, much to our delight, we found a Millenium Falcon made by Playskool. It was much for durable and all pieces stayed in tact. We will be taking back the one by Hasbro and buying the Playskool one for my 4 1/2 year old."
3,"not a very durable toy, but kids love it anyway!!!!!","This toy was the only one my son asked for at christmas. I knew right away when I took it out of the box that it was junk. My son was disappointed that it does not open all the way like the micro machines one that he has had for years. I wanted to return it, but after my son played with the lights and sounds (very cool) he wouldn't part with it. Now it is the only toy he plays with! From an adults prospective, I feel it is cheap, but when I see how much fun my son has playing with it, it think it is worth it overall. He has every other star wars vehicle made in the last 7 years and this seems pretty comparable."
2,Disapointed in this for sure,"I spent almost $50.00 for this for my son for Christmas. He has really wanted it. I agree that lights and sounds are very nice, but that is about it. The landing gear keeps falling off, they won't even support the weight of the ship its self.The ramp keeps falling off and I can't keep the cockpit top on. The gun touret is so far inward he can't get a figure to slide into it. If I knew then what I know now, I would have gotten him one of the orginal ones from ebay. Those were much bigger and much better constructed. After 5 min, my son pushed this to the side and went on to other toys. He was very disapointed.This is nothing like the original. You can't even put more than one figure in the cockpit. A very disapointing waste of $50.00."
2,"Good idea, but very poor qualilty!","We bought this spaceship for our 4 1/2 year old son. Pieces literally fell apart before he even got the Star Wars figures inside it. The gunner won't stay together, the large hatch door would not stay connected and the landing gear wouldn't stay attached. Overall it was very frustrating and disappointing considering how much we paid for it. It would be great fun if it would stay together. We traded it in for the Hasbro's Junior version of the Millennium Falcon which was a big hit and seems to be much more durable."
3,Agreement and tips for the disintegrating pieces,"My four year old loves this toy, but I share many of the complaints echoed in these reviews - especially the problems with the landing gear, ramp, and gun. One thing I tried (which seems to be working) is using Elmer's glue (or something similar) to keep the gun together and the ramp poles on the ramp. Elmer's is nice because it is water soluble, and so can be removed later. Only a little bit was needed to make this toy better. Now, if I can only figure out how to keep the ramp on...I didn't buy this toy, but I probably would have. It is certainly enjoyed by the little one!"
2,Bucket of Bolts,"My six year old son was so excited to get this for Christmas, he had been wanting this for about 6 months and he was thrilled to have received it.Unfortunatley due to the poor quality of this toy after about 2 days this has been stuck in the closet due to his frustration. The pieces keep falling off. The door on the bottom of the craft cannot stay attached and the gun on top falls off as well. The toy itself looks great and has nice detail but unfortunatley its sturdiness lacks.The X-Wing Fighter is a much better toy.Save your money."
5,its a great toy!,"this is a very cool toy, it has a opening cockpit and back. plus a secret floor board for them to hide in! overall it has lights and sounds!"
3,REXX Programmer's Reference,"REXX Programmer's Reference it's VERY GOOD book,but NOT FORMAIFRAME programmer's (like My)."
3,REXX for Programmers book review,"I have just begun to review the book. So far, it has some useful examples and the text seems clear enough. I will not know for sure until I work some tasks on my mainframe."
5,Worth It,"This book tries to cover as much about Rexx as possible in one book. It succeeds well considering the challenge.PROS: Thorough coverage of the Rexx language. Lots of coding examples, good tutorial, very comprehensive reference material. Covers some special topics like interfaces, programming style, error-handling techniques, and portability issues. Includes a lot on Windows and Linux. I had fun with the section on how to program my handheld using Rexx -- yah!CONS: Contains two-plus chapters on object Rexx, but some more advanced material would be helpful. Found some typos, but nothing important.CONCLUSION: Just about every Rexx programmer would benefit from having a copy."
5,Recommend Rexx book,I am long time Perl programmer. I buy this book after reading author articleon Rexx. Theres more to rexx than I thought. This book is recommend it starts easy then it tells you secrets of Rexx. I stay with Perl (they pay for me to do it) but Rexx is very good language. Highly recommend.
3,"Good size, bad use of space","I liked that the box was really big but the shelves are not well designed. The areas to store things are tiny. You can't store newer pencils or paint brushes. I think I might either try and see if I can ""personalize "" the shelves, or return it."
3,Not the best of the Arthurian adaptations by a long shot.,"Skip this one and read Mysts of Avalon or The Book of Merlyn. The author repeats lines and themes, leaves out important pieces, and fails to bring many important characters to life. There are frequent occasions when she tells us about events rather than bringing us into the story. I enjoyed some of the ideas she had about character motivation, but was disappointed with the execution of those ideas."
5,I was blown away,"I just happened to glance at this book at a used book store and it looked as if it could be pretty good. I love the Arthurian legend and read anything I can about it. Not since Mists of Avalon have I been so blown away by an Arthurian novel. Joan Wolf takes the traditional story and changes it ever so slightly here and there to make this almost all-too-familiar story fresh and new. I developed a new feeling for this tragic story that has become so familiar to me. It's been a while since a book has left me feeling so completely drained of emotion afterwards. I thank the gods that I was at home when I finished it and not at work or on the bus. I broke down in almost gut-wrenching sobs. I didn't realize this book was out of print until I came to write this review. I'm extremely happy that I found it and hope many other people have the same fortune I did. Mists of Avalon will remain my favorite, but this one is a very close second."
5,What a wonderful book,I will keep this short and simple Mrs. Wolf is one of the best writers around. I loved this book it was worth every penny and I plan to keep it and read again one day.
3,Okay Care Bears Movie,This movie didn't hold my girls attention as well as the newest Care Bears Movie so I wouldn't really recommend it.
2,Not for young children,I purchased The Care Bears for my granddaughter. The movie is very scary and can give a young child nightmares. She is almost three. If you are going to purchase this watch it with your child and get ready to ff it most of the time.
1,This movie is an ABOMINATION!,I hated everything about this movie. Everyone knows that it is impossible to stand on a cloud. Filling children's heads with such silly ideas is like telling them they can get bad grades and still be president...
1,Sadistic. Creepy. Evil.,"This movie is the most frightening film I've tried to watch with my [...] daughter. It is NOT suitable for very young children. I was rather horrified by just how creepy it is. The juxtaposition of the saccharine bears with the sadistic cruel scary ""spirit"" is truly bizarre and could;ve been created by someone who in fact HATES children. If you are not buying this movie due to your own nostalgic desire to relive the 80's, but to watch something sweet and cuddly with your sweet and cuddly children, be forewarned. This movie is not only bad, it's kinda 'bad'. Like, not in a good way. If children are not involved in the purchase- but you are reliving the 80's or getting some really weird gift for a friend, then, you know, maybe you'll dig it. I didn't."
5,Good movie,"I used to watch this movie over and over and over....so much I wore the video tape out! I had to get it, if not for my daughter, then for me."
4,i went back in time,"actually, it wasn't the picture i was looking for, but i've seen the care bears since i was little, i really went back in time, every kid should see all the care bears movies because they have a very good messagge. i loved it."
3,Not a video for small children,"We got this video for our four year old daughter and it was so scary to her she is petrified to go anywhere alone in our home now. I thought the evil magical book was far too sinister looking and although it was a good story, I do not recommend it for small children or those who are easily scared."
2,Not appropriate for target audience.,"I honestly can't remember the movie itself(I saw it when I was about 6), but I can remember having awful nightmares after seeing it. I guess the villians really got to me, I dunno. IMO, this movie is not appropriate for the audience for which it was aimed.(3-10 possibly) The only reason I gave this movie 2 stars was because it must be fairly memorable if I can still remember my nightmare after all these years."
1,Way too scary!,I do not recommend this video for any child under the age of 10. Anyone 11 years and older won't be interested. Too many bad dreams!
5,Just plain mean...,"As a child of the 80s I adore the Care Bears. As a parent, I love them more than ever. My son watches them constantly. The message of the Care Bears has always out shined the commercialism in my opinion. The songs are fun and easy to sing along with. It's a movie for children, young children at that. I don't think MOST adults would be able to give it a fair review based on it's core audience."
1,Simply Evil,"Yes, my 2 1/2 year old likes this movie. It holds his attention quite well. But, it is really a very disturbing movie. I'm glad I bought it for only a quarter at a garage sale. :) It involves evil spirits and possession of a young boy. My son won't be watching the movie anymore. ""....whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable--if anything is excellent or praiseworthy--think about such things...."" and this is far from anything true, noble and right. Especially considering it is geared toward children."
1,Too dark a movie for preschoolers,"My son, who is 3 1/2, actually likes this film, even though it really scares him. He still asks for the movie, but I don't really want him to see it again. I don't like the emphasis on ""Evil Spirits"" and spells. I don't feel this film is appropriate for young children. It is so unnecessary to make a movie like this for little ones. My 3-year-old already has enough fears, and doesn't need to have anything else added to it."
1,VERY SCARY,"My five year old daughter asked me to return this to the store! She was very scared of the evil spirit. Overall, it is not a happy movie and does not portray kindhearted carebears."
4,It was a gift,This was a gift for my grandmother. She didn't complain so I'll take that as it was what she wanted.
4,Very funny. Alda comes off as the typical dad.,"I've always been a fan of Alan Alda's work. This movie is one of his best. When he's eating dinner with the mafia gang and the bodyguard starts to shoot, I laughed to bust a rib. Alan Alda sure hasn't lost his touch."
5,Sensational,"Alan Alda outdoes himself in this 80's comedy. It's like we have a part of his hawkeye personallity back from MASH in this comedy. And the leading lady outdoes herself in a more adult persona than her earlier ""preety in pink"" ""the breakfast club"" and ""16 candels""."
4,Found it in a Dollar General,Bought it without ever seeing it. Found it in a back corner of a Dollar General. I loved this movie. Great ending. I want to marry Stevie D and make my own dress. What a find.
3,Betsys Review,"On a Madeline Kahn hunt, I found that she co-starred in this movie so I purchased it. Prompt delivery from Amazon again, and good quality. :-)"
4,Lovely version of a family favorite,"I was very pleased when I saw a Blu-Ray of this movie available at such an excellent price. ""Betsy's Wedding"" was one of my family's favorite ""minor"" movies when my kids were growing up, but as such I was not willing to pay serious money to replace our VHS (yes, VHS) copy. Being able to make the replacement for a very reasonable price (and on Blu-ray, to boot) was a real delight. I have no doubt that we'll put this on and enjoy it all over again when the family gathers for the holidays. Thanks, Amazon!"
2,Price? Really?,"Who in the world would pay $500 for this book? Are you kidding me???? I've read it, it's a summary of the story but really. Buy Otis Rice's book; it's worth your money...."
3,good book,"The Dating Game-The book the dating game by Natalie Standford was a very interesting book. The main points never rush into love. I think that a girl would want to read this and not a guy. The reason why is that it talks about things about girls and not as much as to guys. But that is my own opinion. The characters are well explained. They have minds of there own. The book is based on the teens and not the adults and teachers but only one guy teacher Dan. Every girl has a crush on him.The three main characters are Holly, Mads, and Lina. They are best friends. This book kind of relates to me but not as much. It really didn't interest me, it wasn't a pull me in kind of book. But that is what I think. It might be different for other girls. So I wouldn't read it again. Other girls who love reading ""Love"" books would want to read this"
2,This book annoyed me...,"Now I seriously must ponder this question, what person, at 15, desperatley wants to have sex with anyone just to have experience to impress a boy that doesn't even like her. One other main character is pathetically and hopelessly in love with her teacher and basically stalks him.These characters were so annoying! No one is that stupid or desperate. I put this book down several times and seriously contemplated whether I should keep reading or not.I thought the plot was stupid and the main characters were idiots in denial...Yet, maybe someone out there will enjoy it, not me though.I will not be reading the sequel."
2,Sleeves do not work for my dog,My dog does not like the sleeves and when I put it on her she refuse to walk. The pattern is cute.
3,Great sweater but big,This is a great sweater and well made but big. I was looking for a cheap sweater for my new puppy a Chihuahua/terrier mix that is only 3.2lbs so I ordered a x-small and it is more like a small.
3,Bluetooth Headset,"It works very well; easy to use, but:1) the cord is too short for my needs.2) the ear buds don't stay in my ears."
1,not that good!!!!,it really looks stylish and users friendly but it always fall becoz the wire is short and heavy and thick.
4,Good for the beginning reader,"I purchased two Boxcar Children graphic novels for my six year old grandson for Christmas. He is somewhat familiar with the original books, and was quite entertained by reading with me. My hope is that the level of reading is just hard enough to be a challenge but not too frustrating, and this seems to be the case. He is able to read these now with only occasional help.The story line seemed a little thin, leading me to think that some important details were left out of the original. Pictures were OK. And the fact that there are both older and younger characters seems to broaden the appeal of the story, giving each reader someone with whom he or she can relate.I do think these are expensive for the length, but will probably buy some of the other Boxcar books later when he needs more reading matter."
5,never read this one yet,i love all the boxcar chldren and the only one in my house but my mom says its great that theres a series i love to read so im at least reading...a lot
4,My Daughter Thinks this is Pretty Good,"My daughter told me about this book and how she thinks it deserves ""4 stars"". She said that this book was about the Aldens (also known as the Boxcar Children) and how they get new neighbors. They make friends with the neighbors and start to build a treehouse. They discover something mysterious while looking out of the treehouse. She wants me to read the book to find out what happens. The book didn't deserve a five-star rating because she found it not to be as exciting as she hoped it would be."
3,This is a good book but too in depth for most.,"Not every fan wants to sit everyday in the studio with the beatles, but if you did you would learn alot about recording techniques. This book helps to show that the beatles were'nt just creative but they got a lot of help from GEORGE MARTIN and the others at abby road studios. It is interesting to learn every exact sound and effect on the songs but does become a bit dry at times."
4,Beauty and the beasts,"Makedde Vanderwall is a world famous model who was abducted and brutally raped by a sadistic serial murderer, during her stay in Australia. Now back in Canada and studying for her Doctorate at the University of British Columbia, she once again becomes the focus of a crazed psychopath who is targetting young women from the local area. While attending a conference on forensic psychology, she is dismayed to find that Andy Flynn, the Sydney detective with whom she had a brief fling, and who was responsible for saving her life in Sydney, is attending the same conference. She is reluctant to relive any old memories as her insomnia and general mental health seem to deteriorate she relives the past. It's a pacy read and I'm looking forward to the sequel."
3,Tony Can't Sing!,"The band sounds fine,even excellent!You'll have to over look Tony's constant off key vocals. It's very annoying,unless you're tone deaf.Enjoy the band,if you dare!"
5,"Finally, a great horse training DVD","After many years of looking for a great horse training DVD, Ponyboy has finally put out exactly what I'm looking for. The Simple Truth About Horses series breaks the complexities of horse training down into very easy to understand pieces, and also gives you very practical exercises so that you and your horse can quickly master real-life-situation skills. The DVD is great to watch all the way through, and is also set up well to use as a video reference manual. This is the first part of a series, and I can't wait for the next few to come out."
1,Short on explanation,"I was looking for a book that would provide an overview about why the Federal Reserve was formed; what, in general, were the problems it was created to solve, the various approaches considered and the political debate surrounding it as well as a cogent explanation, written in plain language, of how the system functions. I was not looking for a rote recital of historical facts and happenings but a top down explanation leading to a general understanding, historical and operational, of the system. As the Fed is currently an issue of no small contention, I wanted to be able to understand what the hullabaloo is all about. This book is long on facts but painfully short on explanation. Quite disappointing."
4,Excellent Account of a Forgotten Chapter in History,"With much of the historiography of Liberia concentrating on the settlement planted at Monrovia by the American Colonization Society in 1822 and which proclaimed its independence in 1847, the colony independently founded by the Maryland State Colonization Society in 1831 near Cape Palmas and not incorporated into Liberia until 1857 is all but forgotten. Richard Hall now fills this lacuna with his excellent account of the ""Colony of Maryland in Africa,"" later the ""State of Maryland in Africa,"" which was the home some of the oldest educational institutions in the West African nation and which held a disportionate influence on its subsequent development. The reader can pick up where the author leaves off by referring to the important political histories written by Dr. Amos Sawyer (The Emergence of Autocracy in Liberia, 1992) and, more recently, by Dr. John Peter Pham (Liberia: Portrait of a Failed State, 2004)."
5,Fun art kit,My six year old loves this - so do I! It's really fun to sit and make different designs and allows for creative ideas each time. The tray is a bit flimsy but otherwise it's really neat. We've had fun making all sorts of designs.
1,See review for Carnosaur Crimes,I managed to real all of this book but was constantly annoyed by the behavior of the protagonist.It's one thing to be proud of one's ethnic heritage but yet another to make that a reason to think one knows better than authorities.I was quite angry at the end of this story - much of the damage was the fault of the protagonist.
3,not good news,Does NOT fit a 32 oz plumb bob. Other than that it is Ok quality wise. Wish I could find one that fits.
3,A Sugoi Book,"I got all natsukashii, Japanese for nostalgic, when I read McCormack's essays. There were many insights into the Japanese culture that reminded me of my own experiences during my year-long sojourn in Ehime Prefecture, Japan. Although the first part of the book is somewhat repetitive - anecodotes about the trains, the weirdness, the Gaijin syndrome - the second half includes some insightful comments about Japanese culture that could only come from a person who has been there. Although McCormack is at times critical of Japanese institutions, he demonstrates his respect for Japanese people."
5,Tokyo Notes & Anercdotes : NATSUKASHII,It's great. I've been telling all my GAIKOKU-JIN friends 'You have to read this.' here in Japan.
4,Nice,"I ordert two of them, one works great the other one not so good, we have to push the botten a few times for it to work. Not to hard program."
1,POOR SERVICE POLICY,"UNIT DID NOT WORK. WANTED ME TO PAY TO SHIP BACK UNIT,WHICH I DON'T THINK WAS FAIR. WILL NOT BE DOING FUTURE BUSINESS HERE!"
1,Old Product,"Purchased these Lifetmaster remotes and found out they were from 2004, where the new ones you can push two remotes together and they will program the other Lifetmaster to be exactly like the other ones but when the garage company came out he said oh where did you find these old things and even though we still used them I was disappointed to find out they were old technology and have come much farther with this product and had to pay for a longer hourly rate to have it programed due to them being old :("
4,Berry poems,I've long been a fan of Wendell Berry. This book of his poems is a great addition to my collection.
3,Disappointing,"It is not the best collection of his works. I was hoping for a more general collection, this one is all about farming"
1,Printer,"Retuned as not what I had ancicipated. Purchased with a gift certificatefrom Amazon given to me by my wife. It has been a couple of months now since I returned the calculater/printer and still have not received a credit from Amazon. This is not good customer service. You could be thebiggest and richest Amazon, but no customer service, and...............not good."
4,"covers flash, otherwise good case","I took this case snorkeling and scuba diving in the British Virgin Islands, and for underwater use it performed flawlessly.I only have 2 gripes:1) The flash is useless with this case. The ""flash diffuser"" works for close up shots underwater and that's it. Also take off the stupid cord, it tends to float in front of the lens when you take a picture underwater.2) The case muffles the sound during video recording. I took some video of my friends sailing, and you can't hear anything except me yelling next to the camera. Oh well at least the camera didn't get wet!All in all its worth getting this case for underwater photos and video even though it costs as much as the camera its supposed to protect!"
4,Good not Great,Good camera. Reliable and arrived within 24 hours of ordering with overnight delivery.The only thing that was bad about this case was that it got very foggy inside the case when we went out in humid weather and sometimes underwater. It did serve its purpose and the pictures mostly came out without any sign of a foggy lens.
1,Not the Same as the Dentist!!,I bought this with the assumption it was the same product I bought at the dentist. I've used it twice and it is about 1/3 of the strength (same %) that I got from the dentist. No white teeth her. I won't buy from this seller again. Next time I'll go to the dentist.
3,Great show from the last tour with Maurice White.,"Any EWF show you can't go wrong with. If I had one concern about this show it would be that it isn't long enough. Maurice White hasn't performed with EWF in years, so a few more songs would have been great. But that aside, another outstanding show from one of the greatest bands ever, Earth Wind & Fire!"
4,Satisfying Xmas purchase,"Recipient loved, loved, loved the gift; lots of praise and complements were abound. I was very satisfied w/the reaction and purchase"
5,Taz Never Looked Better,"From the time I put the Taz Head Hitch Plug on my truck, I got numerous compliments on it. In fact, if I did not have it locked down, it would have been taken in less than 5 minutes after I installed it. I love it! It adds a lot to the decor of my truck and I am proud to have this item on the back of my truck. I have tried many items on the hitch receiver but none have stood out as fantastic as my Taz."
4,Decent for the price,Kind of cheap manufacture but what can you expect for the price? It looks o.k. enough (as long as you don't look too closely...)
1,Not the same stuff - causing chafing,"I bought a jar of Tiger Balm in Thailand that has lasted for years, and when I ran out, I searched for it on Amazon and purchased this. It's not the same formula, and it is causing chafing on any part of my skin that I apply it. I would return it if I still had the packaging."
5,Tigerbalm,I have been using this for years I think it works great and it doesn't stain your clothes It helps a lot because I can't take any aspirins or Tylenol !!
4,Extra Pain Relief,The wife and I use this when ever we have an extra hard work out in Tae Kwon Do. It is great for those days when one needs a little extra pain relief. The topical application has nothing that will interfere with most over the counter pain relief. A little bit goes a long way so be sure to rub it in well.
5,Wonderful!,"In my business as a veterinarian, emotions strongly influence the behavior of my clients but this often seems overlooked in business literature. Emotional Branding is the first management book I've seen which tackles this critical issue to any business today... how your customers FEEL about your business.This book helped me see how everything my clinic says and does influences by brand promise. I've shared the book with my staff and it has sparked us to make many simple changes to enhance our brand (and to stop doing some of the little things that were not true to our brand promise). We've already seen great results.If you are looking for another typical college 101 academic text filled with positioning maps, SWOT diagrams and simplistic charts-then this book is NOT for you. But, if you want to see your business in a fresh light and feel like being inspired, then I highly recommend this lovely book."
5,An Insightful Read!,"Emotional Branding is terrific. Lots of great examples of how companies have risen above perceived parity to become category leaders by appealing to a consumer's emotional style. The book is an easy, insightful read. I'd highly recommend it."
1,Nothing New,"This is a rehash of everything you've read in every other book about advertising. And, in an affront greater than that of a motion picture company citing reviews from an imaginary critic, ..."
5,Basic Armor Modeling,"This was the first book I bought when I started modeling 2 years ago, and I still go back to read it some more. The chapters on painting and weathering also appear in his other excellent book, ""How to Build Dioramas"". You might want to get this instead if you dabble in different types of scale model building. If you're an armor aficionado like I am, this book is a must, even if you already have a few models under your belt. There are lots of helpful tips, especially on scratchbuilding details and accessories. This has been written some time ago, and you may find some of his techniques a bit dated, but this has withstood the test of time gracefully."
4,Jonathan,"This book was very good, and I would recommend it to anybody who is the fan of the Mindwarp series! However, after reading it, I felt as though it left me hanging. Everyone else has given a synopsis, so I won't waste your time, but know that I DO recommend this book to anybody who is an avid reader of the mindwarp series (even though it wasn't my favorite.)"
3,well...,"One reason why I liked it was because it had a happy ending, which made me feel satisfied. But one reason I didn't like it too much was because I felt like it was written in a hurry, and it was a pretty diluted ending. Like, totally abstract and not really complete. I don't think Chris Archer tied up all the loose ends, but it was an okay ending to the series."
2,Dissapointment,"Chris Archer has written a very fast, very exciting series of books here, that I think hit the spot for the most part. Each book in the series gives an account of each character and stretches out the action to make the reader feel engrossed, even though the books are so short. However, with this book, the conclusion to the series, it seems as if Archer merely wants to finish the series quickly, without putting as much thought or care into it as he had in his other books. I got the impression that, after having read it, Archer wanted to wrap up all of the loose ends and leave the entire enterprise behind. This is a depressing way to conclude a series."
4,"Guys, Listen...","Sure, everyone buys the video for the Teri Hatcher nude scene. You might as well...it did such bad box office that it went straight to TBS (minus nudity)so you won't be recording the unedited original off cable. You could just download the pix from a hundred sites, but dang rabbit, Teri is so sexy in this film that you want to get the whole thing. And while everyone criticizes Alex Baldwin's Cajun accent, Hatcher gets it smooth as silk. Girls, Listen...I didn't read the book. My wife did. And we agreed to see the film after seeing the trailer. She votes thumbs up. As a licensed private detective, I'm not sure I buy the uncoastered Gin Rickey water-mark taste test but, as Johnny Carson liked to say ""You buy the premise--you buy the bit."" I bought it on VHS."
4,Heaven's Prisoners-DVD,This is an excellent movie with a wonderful cast. Lots of action and great cinemotography of New Orleans and the Bayou. The soundtrack is excellent. It is a blend of the blues and New Orleans music. The soundtrack first got my attention but then I saw it on satellite one day and decided I had to have this movie to watch whenever I wanted.
2,Not worth watching,"I don't know why they made this. I read elsewhere the director split before the movie was done. They just stopped and the producer, who didn't like the director, did the final edit, and it shows. Very poor casting all around. The only good scene was the airplane crash, and that isn't saying much! Probably will go in the trash. Watch ""In the Electric Mist"" with Tommy Lee Jones instead, if you like James Lee Burke and Dave R."
3,excellent action and suspense movie,"if you are looking for a movie that will take your mind off politically correct topics or movies that make social statements, this is a good movie. it is full of suspense, action and drama and although alex baldwin is not one of my favorite actors, i really liked him in this movie because he acted very well. as a matter of fact, i am not too fond of anyone in this movie, but i liked the action and drama."
2,"Very depressing, very dumb","An alcoholic ex-cop takes on the drug lords, and because of this macho mission, he stupidly gets his wife killed; for that we are to feel that he is a hero??For those of you that watch this movie just because Teri Hatcher bares all, you're going to be disappointed. That scene only lasts 2 seconds, and you will then realize that she looks a whole lot better with her clothes on."
3,This movie is good because of Teri Hatcher.,This is an ok movie. I watched it only because it had Teri Hatcher in it. Alec Baldwen is pretty good in it also.PS.-Teri Hatcher gets fully nude in this video. Get i
5,great movie,"If you like Alec Baldwin, you'll like this movie. His acting is some of his best. Also a good performance by Eric Roberts. I would have to call this a mystery, not a thriller. I found it a very enjoyable action-mystery movie. A great ""popcorn movie"", one that is good entertainment on those rainy afternoons when there is nothing else to do."
4,Heavens Prisoners,Storyline followed the book precicely. Wish actors & actresses could learn to do a Southern accent.
4,back to the bayou,Pretty good damn flick. Good entertainment value and a great cast (except the implausible Mary Masterton as a stripper).Overall a good plot with some subtle twists. Great locations and some good action scenes.
2,A poor adaption of a very good book,"My main problem with the movie is the casting of Alec Baldwin as the lead character. He is miscast, and should stick to the pretty boy characters he usually plays. His attempt at a bayou accent is ludicrous, for example. Surprisingly, Terri Hatcher does a convincing job in her role. My advice? Read the book, and skip the video."
1,One of those movies that should'nt have been made,"I saw this movie a couple of years ago and was so disgusted with it that to this day I still tell people that it was the worst movie I've ever seen. Nothing in the plot made any sense. It seemed that the whole 'conflict' with the drugdealers could have resolved in the first five minutes of the movie. It was quite apparent that the character's actions were motivated solely by the fact that a movie needed to be made. In other words, there was no character development and everything that happened in the movie only happened because it was a movie and would never apply in reality or anywhere else other than this incredibly long and frusterating movie. I would urge anyone who is even remotely considering watching this movie to at once put an end to those thoughts so s/he will be spared 2 hours of torture."
4,sultry vixen role,"Jessica Hatch doesn't disappoint nude or as her evil cagey, cajin self as a mob ingenue. Evil to the end. Suspensful and bloody plot for all actors. A real sleeper for drama."
4,Very Nice,Very nice music. I would love to hear him play in front of an orchestra or jazz band. I notice this cd was released in 1996... it's time for more from this excellent musician.
1,TINY Unusable Blocks!,"These blocks should not use the word ""UNIT"" in their description AT ALL.They are all tiny with no ""base"" blocks in this set, nor all the others available with checking the site.The concept of storage seemed worthwhile, and the price seemed great.However, the blocks are TINY and the TINIEST ones outnumber the others!I have no idea who is rating these blocks as so great if they don't share the Lilliputian gene!Spend the money and get yourself a solid maple set from northern woodworkers. These are horrible.Avoid return shipping. I want to warn others to avoid my mistake.I'd never seen these in stores and now know why!They can't sell in the retail market when seen by the eye to their miniature scale."
4,nice rainy-day reading.,"Something to read when you have nothing else to do. Interesting, if a little confusing in the begining. I liked it. I picked up the sequal at the library, really not knowing what it was about. I started it, and I kind of liked it, but I had no idea what a lot of the things being refered to were.While in a book store, I saw of Tangible Ghosts and decided that it might help me understand what was happening. This one is good, but if you are looking for a really spy-y novel, read this one so you will understand The Ghost of the Revelater"
4,Good read with a very interesting premise,"I really enjoyed this book. The premise (ghosts staying around) and the consequences of that were very interesting. The action was understated, almost matter of fact, which I liked.Weird pricing on the Kindle edition - normally a publisher will set the first book in a set lower to get people to try out the series then keep the others higher/normal. They appear to have done the opposite here (10 for 1st book and 7 for 2nd/3rd books as I am writing this) for some reason. Of course you can get both the first and second books combined inGhosts of Columbiafor the same price as just the first one too, so who knows what they are thinking."
4,Charming book,"Sort of like a John Le Carre novel set in an alternate reality where ghosts exist. I really loved it; to me, the strange yet familier political meandering and unrushed development made the story all that much more fun. Don't just read a few pages then give up when you don't get immediate satisfaction. Hang in there through at least the first couple of chapters, and if you have any taste you'll love it. :)Wish Modesitt would write more books like this. I personally don't find his Tolkienesque works all that appealing but this book, well, it's one of my favorites. The sequal, ""The Ghost of the Revalator"" is decent, but not as good as this, IMHO."
2,"Clever Idea, Poor execution","This book is based on a clever melding of genres; alternative history, fantasy, and suspense thriller. The alternate history dimension is the setting in an alternate world where North America is split among Quebec, New France (Mexico in our timeline) and Dutch-founded equivalent of the USA, and Europe is dominated by a ruthless Austro-Hungarian Empire. The fantasy dimension is that ghosts exist, a reality something like the Eqyptian Ka, and can be manipulated by electromagnetic fields. The existence of ghosts is responsible largely for the historical divergences between this history and ours. The suspense thriller aspect is the plot. Unfortunately, while the basic idea is clever, this book is disappointing reading. The plot is rather mechanical, the characterization is thin, and the writing pedestrian."
1,"Great Idea, poorly written.","This novel has a great idea at its heart--ghosts are always among us--but this book suffers from a lot of political meandering, poorly written text, and takes too long to get to the heart of the story. Overall the book is boring and hard to read without falling asleep."

4,One of the best,"This is actually one of the best mixtapes I've ever bought. You can listen str8 thru all of the tracks with the exception of ""Destiny"" which I thought was not very good. Great job in the Grand Hustle Camp, tho"
5,So relaxing and beautiful!,"I often put this on when I want to be lulled to sleep slowly. It creates a beautiful mood that soothes, soothes, soothes."
4,"Delightfully, delectably relaxing - wisks you back to the woods!","Dan Gibson's work is wonderful and this is truly one of his more impressive albums! The bird-song is gloriously clear and authentic and the music is marvelously complimentary! It is a great album to unwind with - I take it when I travel and also enjoy it at home, when cooking dinner or catching up with some reading! Definitely would recommend it!"
1,Awful CD,"This CD has seven tracks, six of which use an identical music theme. It's a melachony tune using synthetic sounds. I was so disappointed. I'd really, really have to like the theme in order to be satisfied hearing it six times over.The little bit of birds and water are so overpowered by the music that it really doesn't seem right to categorize it as an couldn't get through even one complete track.Do yourself a favor and make sure you sample it before you buy. My computer won't play the amazon music samples so I bought it based off of positive ratings. For me a complete waste of money. I'll mail it to you for free just to get it off my shelf."
2,not so happy with fit,"used this item on a dell XPS 410, doesnt fit the drive bay to well, hub frame is too short to reach the back stopper, had to rig a homemade clip to prevent hub from moving back into the bay when plugging in a cord, buyers be aware of this problem. i bought this item to upload home movies from my firewire camcorder"
3,Thomson Pottery 16 pc. set,The pieces we received are very good quality and perfect for a beach condo. This pottery is white; not off white.
5,Great deal,Got a great deal. Delivery was prompt. Dishes arrived safety and without any problems. Now I have an additional 16 pc setting to go with the rest of my dishes. Thanks!
2,Bealls Florida has poor customer service!,"Don't get me wrong - I like this set. However, 2 of the mugs arrived broken. I called Bealls and asked them if I should return the entire set, or just the broken mugs. They told me not to return anything, that they would ship me 2 new mugs. 4 weeks later, they still have not arrived. Have to call again. I probably would have rated the product 4 or 5 stars, but customer service and follow up are very important to me."
2,Wouldn't Recommend It,"I bought this set at a local retailer about two years ago. I am not happy with it. The dishes are somewhat fragile and have sustained a lot of cracks and chips with normal, everyday use. I haven't had this problem with other dish sets that I've had prior and my kids are grown now so I don't think it's a matter of being too rough with them or anything. The design is cute and I love the size of the bowls but even those have sustained cracks and chips.I'm currently looking for a replacement."
2,Generalista,"Me parece que este libro da ideas básicas de las estructuras de precio usadas actualmente, sin embargo toca cada tema muy superficialmente y al menos en mi caso tuve necesidad de comprar otro libro sobre el tema con la idea de profundizar mas en las estructuras de precio no lineales."
2,Misleading,"The photo shows two pipes, but I only got one. Not too happy. You show me a picture of something, I expect to get what is in the picture."
1,A Strip of Bacon,"I was very disappointed in the content of this book. I was expecting meat and only got a strip of bacon. I already knew all the fluff stated in the book. I was looking for How to set up vendor relationships?, How can I ""hold"" a suit for my client to 'try on' without having to make a purchase for a couple of days while my client makes a decision? Instead I read 20 of the same statements over and over again (I got the feeling they needed to meet a page quota). Bottom-line: If you are really ""green"" and don't expect executable information, this book is for you. If you already have your office established and have a couple of clients, but no idea how to set up vendor relationships and what/how to charge, then I suggest you learn by trial and error, then write your own book...I will. But please, put some meat in it."
2,If you know absolutely nothing about ...,"...the Concierge profession, this book will be useful to you. It covers the fundamentals of starting your business, but at an 8th, possibly 7th grade level. Doesn't take you much higher than that, either."
2,Mostly common sense info.,"Anyone with any life experience, and, especially, business experience and savy would know 90% of this stuff. Anyone who isn't already aware of it shouldn't be thinking about starting a business in the first place. The list of resources is of some value, so I didn't give it one star."
3,review of How To Start,"Book provided some good information but not enough. Left me seeking more information re: setting prices, establishing contacts. I shouldn't have expected so much in a paperback."
3,A little too basic,"This is a good book for an initial read on the subject, but much of what is detailed is common sense. If you are looking for an 'advanced' read then you might want to give this a miss, but it is a good one to come up to speed on the subject of concierge / personal service."
2,Interesting but fairly superficial...,"Like most things from Entrepreneur, this book does not offer a lot of depth. It is a good primer for someone considering starting a concierge business or errand service. There are a few good ideas along with a lot of common sense that the average person will have figured out before buying the book. Several times the author claims ""there is no hard data available"" - I worked in B2B market research for 9 years, I know reliable data can be developed by anyone who makes the effort. This is the first book I've read on the topic, so I can't make other recommendations yet, but look for this at your library before paying money for it."
3,caution,Beware when I r/c my gazzelle several pieces were missing and the computer does not work. I have even had a friend who is a computer Tech to look at it and its just broken. when I emailed amazon they would not help me replace the broker parts nor the computer. They told me to call the company who sold the gazelle directly. The only phone numbers to the company I r/c with the entire package was to the help training desk who said they couldn't help me. I asked Amazon if they could help me find a service number to call and they said no.
2,I didn't feel like im getting a workout at all,"I don't feel like I get a good workout, or sweat enough i don't feel like im using my mucsles at all..i really thought it would have been better than it was. now i have to try to sell it."
4,Good exercise product for the money..!,"My wife and I purchased this for an at home cardio workout machine. The assembly took about and 45 minutes to complete, and we are very pleased with the machine. The resistance that it comes with is good enough to get your heart rate moving, but don't expect this machine to perform like a high end gym eliptical. This machine is good for people that want to lose some weight via a good beginner-intermediate cardio workout. Advanced users probably will not have alot of use for this machine."
3,Broken,"Like the reviewer above, I recieved mine with a broken piece, and the counters have not worked properly from the moment I plugged them in. I think it will give a decent workout; it should just be of a better quality for what it costs."
4,Great for the price,I you are keeping a new year's resolution this is the machine to get. Don't spend hundreds more for an elliptical. Get this and it will certainly give you a good workout for less than half the price. Ours gets a little squeaky after a while but I'm sure some WD40 will take care of it.
1,Power Piston Anchor Point Broke,The Pro has power piston which broke at the anchor point near the handle. This is a very poor design and I noticed that he changed the position of the power piston on this newer models.
3,You get what you pay for...,"It's a great exercise machine, but poorly manufactured and very difficult to assemble. I have to admit, if all of the pieces hadn't been bent and distorted it may have been easier to assemble. Some of the metal pieces that were bent had to be smashed with a hammer to fit :) But I did NOT want to send it back in that giant box. A couple of pieces were broken, but it still works. To be honest, when the hydraulics are attached it is way too hard for me to do. Even my husband who works out a lot said it was pretty tough. When they are off, it's really not working out at all. So there is no happy medium. However if you are in pretty good shape or have strong legs, it's a nice little machine."
1,We miss Fred Carver,"It's hard to believe that _The Ex_ was written by the same author who gave us the excellent Fred Carver detective series. Those books had memorable characters (who can ever forget the corrupt cop, McGregor?), compelling plots, a keen sense of place, and an anti-hero protagonist we could care about. The same can be said for his Alo Nudger series.This book has none of that. It's like a script from a bad TV movie. The characters are cardboard cut-outs, and the plot is utterly predictable. The final scene is completely illogical. The prose style is prosaic and simplistic--very much unlike the wry, terse style in the Carver books. It wouldn't surprise me if this one was ghost-written.Lutz has won many awards for his earlier detective novels. I suppose he's moved into mass-market commercialism so he can bank some money. Can't blame him--but too bad for his long-time fans."
4,Uncanny view of our future.,Looking at today's newspaper headlines we can now see how the rising demand for food in the emerging nations of China and India has rocked the world food markets. This is a situation that will only increase in intensity until an equitable solution is found. Please read this special report by the Guardian newspaper to see how the world will forever be changed by China's increasing demands for food.[...]
4,great weigh in,"I bought this scale so I could follow the plan at home, and it is very accurate to the WW meeting I attend. I love the user 1-4 feature and we get to track our weight without using paper. I would highly recommend this scale. Trust me we have purchased a few scales and find this is great for the money."
2,"Not impressed yet, where do I put my feet?",This scale hasn't measured the same weight yet. I have tried several times in a row and come up with different numbers up to a 2lb difference. I need a scale that is accurate. I thought at this price I'd be able to get that. Maybe the placement of my feet is the problem? I didn't realize that round scales are harder to judge foot placement. On the square ones I put my feet in the same spot each time. The scale does say Im balanced so maybe its not a problem? I wish I hadn't have bought this scale. Im out about 50.00 and I still cant weigh myself.
1,WW Memory Glass Electronic Scale,"My only fault with the scale, but it's a major one, is that the weight is not consistent. I can weigh myself four times in a row and get 3-4 different weights. Getting the scale leveled once it is stepped upon is difficult, but even if I think I have it, it doesn't weigh the same. I may buy another scale in place of this one."
2,What's Wrong With Mine,With just about anything I buy I look for ratings and recommendations as I did before deciding on this particular scale. Something is wrong because I did not get the same wonderful scale you all rave about. Every time I weigh there is a serious issue ranging up to a forty pound variance which is very frustrating. I am not sure what is wrong but I followed the instructions and cannot get an accurate weight. I cannot recommend that anyone buy this item.
1,Weighs 7 lbs. lighter than many hospital scales,I work in a hospital and 6 different scales weight me at 277 lbs. My Weight Watcher's scale shows me at 270 lbs. Piece of crap. I will return it to Target if I can find my receipt!
1,Most Inconsistent Scale Ever,"After using my old Thinner scale for over 7 years, my husband bought me this scale for Christmas, so I can have an updated and ""more reliable"" scale to weigh in on.As per the title of my review, this scale is by far the most unreliable, inconsistent scale I've ever used to weigh myself. Depending on where I place the scale, I will weigh 3-5 lbs heavier or lighter! Since the shape does not make it easy to store in the corner of the room, I kept mine underneath my dresser. This meant that every time I pulled out the scale to use it, it was on a slightly different part of the wood floor in my bedroom. Yes, even moving it 6 inches to the right or left created that big of a difference in weight.I feel bad that my husband wasted his money by buying this scale, because now after attempting to use it for 4 months, I finally bought a new scale. What the point of weighing yourself if your scale is unreliable?"
5,"Well, I'm impressed!","I'm very happy with this scale. It is consistently accurate and attractive as a design element. The key is to get it on a level, hard surface. I also love the size of the display. I can read it without glasses. The one thing I don't like are the numbers it is displaying... this girl has to lose weight!!!"
1,Readings not repeatable,"Did I gain or lose? I don't know because more often than not I get different readings within seconds of each other. If I move the scale a foot or two in either direction I get even more variation (and the floor is solid). Other reviewers have touted the accuracy of this scale, but I am not sure how they can determine the accuracy unless they are comparing it with a known standard. I cannot recommend this scale to anyone."
3,It's ok,"It's ok but can never get it to have the same reading, even within seconds of each try. It is pretty accurate to the Weight Watchers scale I weigh on each week but it is frustrating at home trying to see where you are at when you cannot believe it."
2,Unreliable,"No matter what surface I put this scale on, it gives me a different reading every time. I'm not talking a reasonable difference either - I'm talking up to a 20 lbs difference. I previously had a WW scale and loved it, but this scale is nothing but frustrating. I gave it 2 stars because I like the look of it, but frankly I barely use it because I cannot rely on it to accurately gauge my current weight."
2,Inaccurate,"I was very disappointed in this scale. I was hoping it would match the weight at the Weight Watcher Center where I attend classes. I loved the design and the fact that it had the partial pounds that my old scale does not. However, I never could get this scale to weigh even close to the old one and one time within four hours I had lost 11 pounds. Since that is not possible I was forced to return this scale and stick with my old one."
3,WW scale,"This is a classy/modern looking scale. Because it it round, it takes up a lot more floor room than a traditional square scale (you can't push it flush to the wall). I returned mine because when I would step on it 3 consecutive times, I would get 3 different readings that varied 2 - 5 pounds of each other. When you are at goal/lifetime member with WW, you can only be 2 pounds over, or else you have to pay for your meeting. Having the scale vary too much was not acceptable for me to make sure I was meeting the WW weigh-in rules."
5,weighing scale,i love it. it is fairly accurate and easy to use. it is also good lookingmy last one broke so i had to replace it
5,Great Scale,My husband wanted a digital scale that would be more accurate than our old giant dial unit.This scale is very attractive. The wieghts obtained are accurate and reproducible.The foot placement guiding arrows feature is nice.The memory feature is good for those who like to track progress.
3,"OK, But Accuracy In Question....","This is an attractive scale with a large LED readout, a level and easy to start with slight pressure of your foot. However, compared to my 10 year old similar circular Thinner MS-9930 scale, it reads about one pound higher and varies by at least a half pound depending on what solid surface it rests upon such as marble, tile or wood. I dont think Conair makes them like they used to."
5,Best Scale EVER !!!!!,"Wow. I never thought I'd ever be excited about a scale before. This scale makes it a pleasure to weigh myself. It is the best looking scale I've ever seen. It is a sturdy piece of equipment. Very solid and does not have that cheap feel to it. It's multi functions are unique and quickly become essential. Unable to find these functions on any other scale.If you are shopping for a scale and comparing models, stop here. I'll save you some wasted time looking. Buy this scale and become as thrilled as we are. I need to also say that i purchased this on a Thursday and it was delivered to me by Amazon.com on Friday. Shipping could not be any better. Love, love , love Amazon!!! Fantastic customer service."
2,Not happy at all with this product,"I purchased this scale in between switching residence. So after a month, I started to use it on a daily basis. Not only are the readings inaccurate, but the user programming function does not work. Instead, I get ERR and the scale turns off.It's quite frustrating. I expected a much better product from WW. I'm very disappointed and now I may be past the 30 day return policy so I may have to keep this defective item."
1,Don't waste your time!,"This scale worked for 5 months, then it broke and kept giving me readings that were 20lbs less than I weigh. My weight varied up to 10 lbs every 3 minutes. Conair kindly replaced it after I had to pack it up for shipping. A new version of same scale arrived 3 weeks later. It was broken from the very beginning. I never got a correct weight reading with the new one. Did I mention how many times I replaced the battery on the 1st one thinking the battery had run out?I think I will try another brand this time!"
1,off by about 5 lbs,i bought two w. watcher scales because the first seemed off. i was right. this one is about 5 lbs too light. it changes depending on surface. big waste of money.
3,Inconsistent weight,"I'm big (c. 350 lbs), and this scale can be inconsistent up to c. 5 pounds in 5 minutes. For example, I get up in the morning, weigh myself, and get 347; then I reweigh myself and get 350; on the third weigh I get 345. What I've started doing is weighing myself 3 times and taking the average. Maybe this is better if you're lighter--I hope to find out! Two advantages: its display is very easy to read and it goes over 300 lbs."
3,scale back,"scale was advertised as new but not in a original carton. True it was not in the original carton and that was ok with me. How ever it was not new. Upon inspection, the underside rubber legs showed signs of wear, there were very small white hairs stuck to the legs along with ingrained dirt particles. All of the above reveals to me that the scale was used, NOT new. :o(("
2,Various weights,"After reading the reviews I settled on this scale. It looked great although it was a bit pricier than my taste, but I thought ""Hey, you get what you pay for"". At first the scale seemed to work and weighed within the same one pound range no matter where I put it on my bathroom floor. Now in the third week it has readings all over the place (I only weigh myself once a week, but several times in a row to be sure I get an accurate reading). I am very disappointed and frustrated!"
1,big mistake,"The one thing I learned is to NEVER ever buy an electronic scale again. I've had 2 of them. The first one I got lasted me a month and this one didn't last me a week before it started giving off sparadic readings with each weigh in. It's not accurate for any length of time and I found it to be a complete waste of money. Apparently these electronic scales are far more sensitive then anyone admits to and you end up spending anywhere from $60 or more for a pretty decoration that serves no purpose. My advise friends, stick to the good old fashioned dial scale. They haven't failed me yet!"
1,Wish I could give this zero stars!,"Absolute piece of crap. It's nice to look at but doesn't function well as a scale at all. I tried this scale in numerous places in my home and even got out a level to check the floor. I weighed myself 20 times over a 4 hour period and did not once get the same result. In fact, the results were ridiculous. According to this scale, I weigh 24 lbs one minute and 318 lbs the next minute. Don't waste your money on this. I'm sending mine back."
2,"Weight was off a few pounds, couldn't find a way to recalibrate.","I got this model couple years back, which I payed just about $100 at frys electronics. I liked the look, but feltripped off after I searchd online and compared it to other models who were less expensive and double the features like body fat, etc. Calibration was off, and insured it by checking my own weight on 2 different scales. I searchedfor a way to re-calibrate it but found nothing. My own fault for buying on impulse."
2,Throw away item.,This scale worked well for a while but after a few years it died. Now it's a big piece of junk for the landfill.
2,Received defective scale and sent back,"I read the reviews and thought this might be a suitable scale but I couldn't get it to work and returned it the next day. The scale came on, the settings worked, but I when I stepped on to weigh it gave me an ERR message. Now the instructions say that only happens if you weigh 380 lbs. Trust me, I'm no where near that. I spent quite a while trying to get it to work and finally gave up.While I was disappointed, I decided to opt for a more expensive scale that would provide the weight in tenths the way I needed. I replaced this with a Health-o-meter digital scale and it works perfectly."
4,Quick and easy,"I don't think it gets any easier. Open it, put in the battery and it's ready for me to weigh myself. I find that the backlight is very useful."
4,i like it but my wife does not.,i like it. My wife says it weights different at the same time. I say it is very normal.
1,Inaccurate Weight Readings,"I, like several before me, am having a issue getting this scale to read my weight properly. It has thus far been impossible to get the same reading twice and I've only owned this scale for 20 minutes!It is a waste of money, purchase something else."
1,Either a defective product or poorly designed,"I knew there was a problem with this scale the first time my son weighed himself and it recorded his weight 25+lbs over his weight. He stepped on the scale 3 times in a row and got 3 different weights each at least 20 lbs more than he weighs. The second day, thinking perhaps the scale was not on a level space, we moved it to another location. The LED's that are supposed to indicate that it is balanced did not work properly -- kept indicating the person needed to move to one side even when there was no room left on the scale to do so. Giving it one more try, the third day, 4 different members of the family tried several times to weigh themselves. It was impossible to get the same weight twice in a row and there were variations from 1-15 lbs. We returned it on the fourth day. I'm not sure if I just got a defective product or if this is poorly designed product but I didn't take any chances. I would not recommend this product nor would I buy it again."
4,A Kultural Kaleidoscope....,"Although it drags in places, especially the over-coverage of obscenely expensive keep-up-with-the-Cohens parties, it's mostly well written, interesting and thought provoking. One under-reported aspect, in my experience, is the role played by b'nai mitzvah in bringing together and maintaining the bonds of far-flung families. With 'living together' as common as marriage, and with low key ceremonies and elopements the frequent follow-through to 'living together', family get-togethers could be decades apart without the b'nai mitzvah events."
1,Not worth the money,"This book was a huge disappointment and not worth the money I paid for it. The text is mostly an unstructured collection of historical and often outdated facts about the development of electronic exchanges. It barely touches on onlly a few aspects of the subject but without any structure, depth or valuable insight. The author's anecdotal style of writing does not do justice to what is a very interesting and challenging subject. Not recommended for serious industry professionals."
1,This book is not worth buying. It's worthless.,"The book is for general information. It's over priced and gives no explanation on ""how to"" setup electronic trading. This book is basically worthless."
5,Great Book for Constrcution...,"This book is amazing. Still being in school, it has helped me in my internships. There is only so much you learn in school and this book has everything else. I would recommend it to anyone. A++"
2,A poor manual at best,"This manual does not live up to the hype that the publisher put out. The illustrations are rudimentary and the definitions are shallow. Most of the illustrations have to do with obvious or outdated construction items. This may be a useful manual for people who are starting out in the industry (or history buffs), but definitely not for the seasoned professionals. One more book to gather dust on the shelve..."
3,The Start of a New Series,"David Donachie has begun a new series with this book. It continues with #2 ""A Shot Rolling Ship"" and #3 ""An Awkward Commission"" with possibly others to follow. ""By the Mast Divided"" sets up the characters and begins dual story lines following the lives of John Pearce and Ralph Barclay (Pearce's enemy). This book and the second end in cliff-hangers, so be prepared to read further. Once the series begins, the action is fast and well paced. Donachie has written other Age of Sail series that I enjoyed, notably the Privateerman Mystery (Harry Ludlow) series of 6 books and the fictional history of Lord Nelson and Emma Hamilton. Worth a read."
4,A good start to a new series,"I enjoyed Donachie's ""Privateersman"" series, and the new ""John Pearce"" series does not dissapoint. There are a lot of characters and backstories, amd the books tend to end with cliffhangers, but the story is interesting and different enough from many of the other nautical fiction books I have read. A good start to a new series."
3,Somewhat tedious,Too much explanation of historic sailing terms that takes away from story. Fair to good character development. The plots are not well connected at times.
3,Not what I expected,Received this tray today and was disappointed to find that it was already tarnished. It also has a warped bottom that sounds like a drum everytime I take something off and on the tray. It is a pretty tray and looks nice sitting on my table but I expected better quality from this company. I am too lazy to box it up and send it back so will just live with my mistake. I ordered it because others gave it such high marks. Guess you can't always go by what others recommend.
2,Ok! but much better out there,"I was very disappointed with the fact that this being a book on photography had the photos being refered to in newsprint black and white quality. I must add that the original was available to see on the web. What a pain, this book would have been much better and more interesting had the color images been in the book. There are some color photos located in the center of the book. Also the information is repetative and not presented in an interesting way. I think that both the editor and writer could have done a much better job. I am glad I only paid $1.88 plus shipping for this book. The 500 pages could have been reduced to 200. An ""image speaks a thousand words!"" isn't that what photography is all about?"
5,Love it,"Used these songs back in the ""80-90s"" to teach aerobics and work out. Great motivating songs, Also good for running"
1,FAIL!!!!,"This is even worse then TMNT 3. The puppetry is horrible this side of Falkor from Neverending Story 3. The music is soo dreadful,you think it was written by Tommy Wiseau. The dialogue is third-rate. The fact that everyone in the film treats the turtles like they are a real band is soo unrealistic,the people who wrote this film should been if not already fired. Not only the ending drags on,it drags on even though the closing credits have already ended. I give this film a 0 out of 10."
2,Wasn't what I paid for.,"Instead of the video cassette advertised, I received a tape of a family's home movies in the sleeve."
2,Horrid Textbook,"Physical chemistry is confusing enough on its own! The textbook, while it does help a little, can add to the confusion depending on how much your professor depends on it. There are some editing problems, such as a figure/graph covering its own caption. The book does have problems to work on, and it is extremely helpful to have the solutions manual on hand. Otherwise you can get really lost. I would not recommend this book for self-study"
1,Get the 7th Edition,"This book was a required text for the physical chemistry college course. To start there are many misprints or typo on several rate constants for the given equation: PV=nRT. The form in which the units are represented can be misleading and at times confusing. Compared to the 7th Edition it is more difficult to answer the exercises and problems at the end of each chapter. Most of the time one must assume ideal gas behavior to answer the questions, however, the instructions do not advise or inform the student they must assume ideal behavior in order to correctly solve the problems or exercises. The only saving grace is obtaining the students solution mannual!"
2,Great for a bonfire....,"and that's about it. It was one of the worst science textbooks I have encountered and if I never have to see it again, that's too soon. About 1 question out of every 5 was wrong, and there were huge errors throughout the text. Things were explained poorly and I actually did better when I didn't have the book confusing me. I don't know about this book, but other books by Peter Atkins only get worse with each new addition. I was very happy when I was able to get rid of it."
2,Below quality,"The quality was well below what was listed. It was considered good quality, but the book itself was detatched from the cover at the spine. To me that is poor quality not good or near new."
3,"Good coverage of material; lousy binding, pics, and ancillaries","As with other editions of Atkins' P-Chem (I own 4th, 5th, & 7th), the topics are covered rigorously and at a level that I think is appropriate for a solid junior undergrad course in P-chem.For a text that keeps up quite admirably with advancements in science, the diagrams and ancillaries (e.g., living graphs) continue to be weak and well behind the pedagogical innovations that make p-chem more accessible to students.The quality of the binding is unacceptably poor. Like others on this page, I too have a copy of the text with the cover that has come apart. Freeman ought to republish the text with improved binding. This text should serve as a reference for students to use for many years to come. It absolutely cannot serve that function with the quality of the binding in this version."
1,Worst textbook ever,"Where do I begin? First of all, nobody buys a textbook unless they're enrolled in a class that requires it, and my class does. Unfortunately, my instructor is also a former colleague of Atkins, who, by his admission was a madman. Atkins uses notation that no one else uses, words questions in a way that is nearly unintelligible and generally does a poor job of explaining what should be at most difficult - and I get A's in physics, math and chemistry. If you are a professor contemplating using this book for your class - I beg of you, on behalf of your students, please, don't torture them like that."
2,Example Problems Please,"This book covers basic physical chemistry well as far as I can tell. I am a college junior taking 1st semester p. chem. The problem with this book is the complete lack of any example problems in the text. Doing any but the most basic of the questions in the problems section at the back is a horrendous expierience. Now, I know that there should be difficulty but this is ridiculous. A few well placed sample problems worked out in the text would provide the student with an opportunity to learn the process of approaching these problems. Instead we just get a bunch of text, pictures and formulas and are told to solve problems. Solving is a process and this book does not provide it."
2,Poor quality binding and Poor quality derivations.,"Of the 18 students in my physical chemistry course, at least 6 have lost their covers entirely. This is less than 3 months after the publication of the text. In addition the quality of the derivations, while somewhat better than the 7th edition, are oftentimes difficult to follow, Steps are skipped and it is often assumed that students are not only familiar with mathematical concepts beyond the scope of the course, but that they have the ability to apply these same advanced mathematical abilities to new concepts. In addition many of the problems require you to look up values from non related sources such as the CRC. The solutions manuals have numerous faults and oftentimes use entirely different methods of solving problems than are presented in the chapters. Yes physical chemistry is a very difficult subject, that is expected, however we can at least ask that the covers remain on our texts."
3,GOOD BOOK-BUT NOT GREAT,"This biography is splendidly researched, and that counts for a lot in a book that covers as much time and as many events as this one does. But, it is also rather bland. The writing is mechanical, merely an effort to get all the facts in place for the reader. There is never any fire to the words, no sparkle in the sentences.If you have never read a biography of Patton, this book will do. But, if you happened to have read the wonderful ""Genius For War"" that came out a few years ago, this work concerning George Patton's life will bore you. There is really no new information here, just a few different interpretations of that info.I had hoped, when I opened this book, that I would find a brand new take on the life of this fascinating general. However, it wasn't so, and that is not necessarily the fault of Stanley Hirshson. Patton was Patton. He was vibrantly, emphatically ""Patton"", and he didn't leave a lot of room for anyone to reinterpret his life."
3,Neither Extreme is True,"Those who hate this book and those who love it are likely exaggerating. I agree most with the comment re: ""American Caesar."" I didn't expect this book to live up to William Manchester's portrayal of MacArthur, and it doesn't. Its prose is somewhat dull, but it is not poorly edited.I also don't think it's too anti-Patton. While reading, I find myself siding with Patton against his enemies, many of whom were as petty as he was at times. Ultimately, the book makes me want to read more, and I think that's a strike in its favor."
1,Not worth the time,"Grabbed this in an airport prior to a flight. I didn't even read the jacket, figured I couldnt go wrong with a biography of an American hero. The 'author' shamefully makes linkages between Patton and 'a series of civilian and military massacres in Sicily...'Trapped on a plane for 5hrs, I gave it an honest chance. I struggled through about 75 pages and had to lay it down. I dont know if it was the laborious details of family members, the revisionist BS, or a combonation of both."
1,The Prof never learrned to write nor his editor to edit,"Writing is about more than researching. This is the worst written, worst edited book I've ever read. Scribblings from Professor Hirshson's notes - I had to stop after 76 pages."
2,Mr. Hirshson does NOT like Gen G S Patton.,"Mr. Hirshson tells us that he took some years to research the book. Well I guess when you try to find all the skeletons in ones closet, look long enough and you will find them. What really surprised me was the very short mention of G S Pattons so called accident that brought on his untimely death.A four star General has an accident and so little is written. Mr. Hirshson did not find any more or did not want to write more about it, we shall never know. Maybe it is better so. But the book is not worth riding."
3,An over-the-hill professor's lecture,"Aside from excellent points made by other reviewers, I found Hirsohson's book full of repetitions, untenable assumptions or conclusions and in some cases too much detail; all of which reminded me of the lecture of a brilliant history professor who has been kept on the job too long and whose mind is approaching senility. There is useful new information about Patton and some of his subordinate generals but this is not the ""definitive"" biography."
1,Anthology of Negative Stories,Author went out of his way to avoid even the least amount of positive reflection upon Patton. Most work is taken out of context as the story jumps around. I would avoid this book as it makes no attempt to present any type of balance. Episodes which are well documented are avoided if they show Patton's ability.Other books do a more balanced job showing a man who is hard to define.
4,Dynasty Warriors only in Japan,this game is very fun but can be diffcult. for one thing the castle levels i think are almost impossiable because fo the booby traps. but it is too easy when you fight on the fields because you can easily demolish everyone. i do have one suggestion that you do two player mode for the campaigns because you can do multiple objects at the same time
2,I'd rather be playing Dynasty Warriors,"I love the Dynasty Warriors series, so when Koei came out with Samurai Warriors I was thrilled. I thought it would be very much like DW, but with Japanese history and characters. In many ways they are alike, and in some ways they are different and that's still good. The ""musou"" attack in SW is sort of a time freeze where you are still in control of your character unlike DW. I thought that was a nice change, although I still like the Musou attack in DW also.In SW it feels like I am constantly trying to figure out where I need to be and I never seem to be close to the right place. The maps are more confusing than DW. It shows an X marking where I need to be, I begin heading that way and find a closed off gate. I am then forced to backtrack, losing mission time.The game is pretty cool in some ways, but I find myself yelling at it more than enjoying it.I would rather play Dynasty Warriors 4 Empires personally."
5,this game is hard,"samurai warriors is a hard game. i beat 2 of the stories, yukimura's and the samurai's tale. the highest rank is a twenty. you might want to have 2 people when you're doing story mode. if one of you is a 1 and the other is an 18 you might want have backup. 2 player mode is cool because you go into a mode and just kill everyone in sight. you can also create a charecter. you can have up to 5 people and use them in story mode. you want to be on nobunaga's because his excircises or easier than the other lords, like shingen. that guy dies for god sake. if you like dynasty warriors you'll like this."
1,The worst book ever bought in Amazon,"The author only writes about him, the book and companies who work around the art world and writes very less on what I think the book is written for: profiting and collecting fine arts!"
1,Aweful book of little to no substance.,"Aweful book of little to no substance; therefore, it is certainly not worth purchasing or even borrowing. Cannot take away anything of value here. Printed with large font probably to take up more pages in a book."
2,Half Baked Golden HIts,"If you love and remember the music of Paul Anka like I do you'll notice the music on the CD is simular, yet ""not all there"". The background music does NOT match the original record. I've encountered the problem on other Paul Anka CD's. However, There is ""one"" that I can personally attest to. ""It's perfect"". The one to get is: ""Paul Anka His All Time Greatest Hits - Anniversary Collection with number ""30"" on it. The music is all there on that CD and is ""perfect""."
5,Great for EKG beginners,If you are a first time learner or need some brushing up on EKGs this is an excellent book. If you are wanting to take it to the next level then you need another book. This book is self paced and in sections. You can take your time learning EKGs in your spare time or on a work break.
1,not for MD,"This book could be easy to read, easy to understand. But, it is popular science for people who do not really need EKG as a tool in making life/death decisions.Go for it if you are one of them. To my MD colleages, my impression is this book is ART as it says. No science. It really made me annoyed to find that the book has a large chapter about hemodynamics... Just to blow up the volume?"
3,Ok movie,"Plays back in the eighties early nineties, with people still wearing large glasses, and typical 80's hairdo.Has some nice tibetan landscapes.The movie is really into bringing eastern philosophies like reincarnation into the west, but largely ignored by the western scientific mind. I am not a believer in reincarnation though.I find it a pitty the movie looks so realistic, and even shows some culture of the buddha, but does not tell what happened to the main characters after they finish the story.It is fiction after all...."
4,A good primer to understanding reincarnation,"Little BuddhaThis is a good movie, not a blockbuster, that seemed to be fairly accurate in it's protrayal of Buddhism and reincarnation, at least by my limited knowledge. The story is simple and I enjoyed it, but the footage taken in India, Nepal and Tibet were worth the price alone. The tree in the yard (or garden) at one child's home was FANTASTIC. If you are interested in learning more, see a real search for a reincarnated lama in the Unmistaken Child[[ASIN:B002MZCSW4 Unmistaken Child]. This incredible documentary, with breathtaking scenery, follows a solitary monk on his search for a reincarnated lama. Little Buddha is appropriate for families. Young school-age children would probably benefit from an adult to watch with them. I can only imagine that many questions would arise. I hope this helps."
2,A very fanciful unlikely story,"Buddhism has so much to offer and there are so many excellent presentations around. I hardly think this film is justified. It is just superficial intertainment, but for many that may be all they want."
4,A collection of short stories,"Well, I certainly don't consider myself a book critic. I just want to share with the potential readers of this book with my thoughts. Rather than calling it a book I would rather consider it a collection of short stories, albeit the stories all took place during Jack London's cruise on Snark which ended in the Solomon Islands. London was certainly a gifted writer and like all gifted story tellers he had a way of drawing the readers into the story as if you are a part of his crew on the Snark. I particulary enjoyed his last chapter titled ""Amature MD"" which is absolutely hilarious. I could not stop laughing throughout that story."
5,Enjoying it. Its Lovely,"It is really yummy it seems. I purchased this from Sri Lanka to deliver it to my sister in Seattle, America for herI got her surprised comment saying it was awesome.can recommend to purchase this."
1,More Trouble Than It is Worth,"While it DID pick up the pet hair, the front piece kept flipping up and the attachments kept falling off. The on/off switch is too low to get to in an emergency if something gets sucked up that shouldn't be sucked up. Too heavy also."
3,Not made by Bissell,"Becareful.When you search for Bissell 8 14, the 1st link that comes up is, ""Bissell Style 8/14 Lift-Off Bagless HEPA Filter by Bissell"". However, what you get is a Crucial Vacuum product. If you want the Crucial Vacuum filters, you can get them for $.99 less if you select the link that indicates ""by Crucial Vacuum"".Note: 3 stars for wrong product description, not for quality of product."
3,Generic filter,"Mine was shipped and sold from Killer Dirt. It fits well, but it's a generic product. Mine was HEPA with charcoal filter or something that's supposed to make it ""better"".It's just a filter, and as long as it fits well and is still a HEPA filter, I don't have too much complaint.Although, it SHOULD say ""GENERIC"" if it's not made by Bissell. When I ordered this product and received it, I expected to see a BISSELL filter, not some generic filter, I almost feel deceived.I don't mind generic, it's just a filter, but I should be informed if i'm buying a generic filter or not. It doesn't say this in the product description. Heck, my filter was black because it has charcoal filter, doesn't even match the white picture."
1,Not a match to the original,"I'm torn when I buy stuff like this, because the manufacturer always tells you to buy THEIRS. This one was offered at a much better price, and I gave it a shot. This is not a Bissell product, and when it arrived, it was built so that the filter goes in reversed from the original. I made an inquiry and did not get a reasonable response from the seller. So I cut off two plastic tabs in order to make this filter fit my Bissell machine. I did make it fit, but I end up with a room full of dust when I vacuum now. I'm usually in favor of aftermarket replacements, but i don't recommend this product."
2,It didn't work for my Bissell Velocity 3950 Model,I decided to buy a replacement HEPA filter when my 3950 Upright became reluctant to pick up dirt and the filter compartment turned very hot. I bought 2 of these HEPA filters from Amazon and the delivery was quick. It fit the filter compartment perfectly but both had the same issues as my old filter. I was very disappointed and doubted that the filter was made by Bissell. Fortunatly Amazon made the return super easy for me. Then I thought of buying the similar style 8 filters made by Filtrete but gave up due to fear of having the same experience. I ended up buying a new vac from Amazon (Shark lift away Navigator)
5,GREAT PRODUCT,Great Price for a great product.Perfect fit and appears to do a fine job of filtering.Recommend product.John
3,Bissel 'lift-of' hepa filter,"We like the concept of the Bissel 'lift-off' as it is very portable and compact. The vacuum cleans well and has good suction. Our problem is dirt holding capacity and the cleanable filter arrangment. If not closly monitored debris will over flow the small debris cup quickly accumulate around the upper foam filter. The unit then requires disassembly and cleaning of the upper filter assembly. The 'hepa' filter I just purchased needs to be replaced regularly and is rather expensive as an expendable item. Not replacing this filter will cause poor performance and overheating of the motor. This would be a great vacuum for a single person without pets, I am neither."
2,Didn't quite fit.,"I have a Bissell Lift-Off. It takes a style 8 filter. These filters say they fit my vaccum, but they don't. I had to take a metal file to the edges of the plastic in order to cram them into the filter compartment. Apparently the filters are a few millimeters too big. Guess that's what I get for not choosing the Bissell name brand filter."
1,Why?,Vacuum cleaner did not last long enough to use the second filter. The filter was fine and exactly as adviertised.
3,poor fit,It took me about 5 minutes to get it into the filter holder. It is a hair bigger than the original Bissell brand filter therefore it dosen't want to snap in.
3,bissell?,"this filter claims Its pleated design and dense materials keep 99.9 percent of dust mites, ragweed, and pollens inside the machine, so both the atmosphere and the carpet in your home is cleaner.while a bissell filter may do this, this is not a bissell filter even though it is sold in the bissell store. it is a DVC brand filter and no where on the packaging does it say Its pleated design and dense materials keep 99.9 percent of dust mites, ragweed, and pollens inside the machine, so both the atmosphere and the carpet in your home is cleaner."
3,Works as stated,Our store where we bought the vacuum didn't have the parts to replace anything. Glad we found it here. Vacuum works great again.
2,This is a book for BUDGET travelers.,"Pretty much an average travel book on the surface, but once you get into it you realize that it's for backpackers and students. The section on accomodations in Nice is hostels only, and the top recommendation near the beach is where we stayed. It turned out to be a total dump! We were afraid to let our feet touch the floor, and we could hear the woman in the next room coughing all night.The section on Paris was definitely lacking in the map department. They have sections describing some of the hotspots in each district, but no map to show you where they are. They get some points for suggesting a few good restaurants, but overall I won't be buying another Let's Go book."
2,Let's NOT Go buy this book,"We recently utilized this book while on our honeymoon to France. I must say that the hotel suggestions [are really bad]. Typically, the listings are of one-star places with a lot of ""character"" which is fine, unless you want to stay someplace new, clean, and spacious. In several cities, the book inexplicably listed dumpy places where there were much better options in the same price range. The maps are TERRIBLE, and I would say thet not a single one of the restaurant recommendations was really worth it. Also, there is an attempt at, but no result of, a useful phrasebook in the back, as I have seen in other guidebooks. The book misses several great things, such as markets, walks, and synagogues, among others. Go with Lonely Planet books--I used the France book a few years ago and had no similar complaints."
3,Hide And Shriek,I Recomend that you read this book Hide and Shriek.iTS A Great BOOK AND SCARY IF YOU THAT YOU CAN READ AII BOOKSFROM Rl STINE LIKE The Barking GHOST CALLING ALL CRE
3,"Not Bad, Not Great...Expensive","Does what it says it's gonna do...I'm just not as impressed as I should be considering the money I spent. Someone really has to use it on you, which I knew, but the vibrations are so strong it's uncomfortable to hold. I'd prefer the 50 dollar ones you can pick up at the drug store."
3,Variable Speed Jeanie Rub Massager,"Likes:1.) It really is heavy duty; industrial strength really.2.) Sturdy and well built3.) Effective when giving massage to another person, provided you know what you are doing.Dislikes:1.) It's too heavy to be used comfortably for self massage. It's really not appropriate for anything other than large muscle groups and easy to reach places. Tried it on arms, shoulders, neck, without any real effectiveness. Found it very uncomfortable to use due to its size and weight.2.) Location of control knob makes it awkward to use in certain positions.3.) When using it on myself, it did not have the kind of muscle penetration I had hoped for, not even on quadriceps, hamstrings and calves where I was able to control or moderate the pressure.Bottom Line:It is a quality, heavy duty massager and it has limited applications for which it is very good. Unfortunately it did not really fulfill my needs or expectations."
1,Good if you can bare holding it!,"I can't complain about the message this machine produces as I haven't used it much! lol I got this machine few months ago and still can't use it as it produces a huge amount of harsh vibrations that reaches the handles which makes it really difficult to hold. I tried to convince my wife to use it on me but she always refuses preferring to make it with bare hands saying ""It really hurts""! also as soon as you plug and operate this machine it produces a very very noisy and scary sound that really freaks me out every time i try to operate it. It feels as if it's going to explode or at least burn.If i had the chance to return it I'd definitely do, too bad I can't as I already left the US"
2,Not what I expected,"My husband is a retired massage therapist. He suggested we purchase the Jeanie Rub because he thought it would be great! However, it is not. Not only is the unit extremely loud, but it's heavy and uncomfortable. Basically, it doesn't do much. You can barely feel anything and the attachment package does not help. It's a pain to unscrew the screws for the attachments, also. For the price, I expected something I could use with certain points. This thing vibrates so much, it hurts my hands to hold it."
4,Varible Speed Jeanie Rub Massager,This is a good product. The only only thing that I do not like about it is that when you hold the handles the strong vibration feel like an electrical shock to the hands. I will find a way to pad the handles and all will be well. This is great for the pain between the shoulder blades that can be caused by numerous different organ problems that share the same nerves. It is the only thing that I know that works for this problem..
4,Ahead of it's time,"This game was definitely ahead of it's time, units had morale and everything. If you ever wondered where the idea for Rome Total War came from, check out this game although I doubt that today's PCs will be able to run it. The chariot racing and gladiatorial combat mini-games were amusing also."
2,BAD PICTURES,"THIS BOOK IS ONE OF THE WORST FAIRIE BOOKS I HAVE EVER READ. NOT ONLY IS THE WRITING HORRIBLE, BUT SO ARE THE PICTURES."
1,Worst season ever,"My best advice : Save your money .I tell you one time more ..Save your timeI will tell you a little secret: This is by far the worst season of this series.Neither the quality of the format ""blu-ray"" saves this series from being one of the worst seasons I've ever seenThis season has a plot with no common sense as the other seasons but I do not want to reveal anything about the characters .All i want to say is . Jack the time is overI do not know who was the scriptwriter of this Tv series but he totally broken the outlines of the previous seasonsWorst season possible"
1,it supose to be bluray the quality is bad,it suposse to be bluray but it was bad experience for me with this product becase along the movie a lot scene have bad quality worse not for a bluray movie
1,"the worst season ever , dont waste your time and memories of good 24","really this seasons deserves a zero star without a challenge , the plot is too stupid to watch .please dont hate 24 because of this stupid season , this is nothing -which is actually nothing- compared to seasons 1-5 .shame on the producers ."
2,Never arrived,"I never received this item. Altho the seller was quick to refund my money when I contacted him, I was disappointed that I wasn't able to get what I ordered. I probably would not use this seller again."
2,Going Green Means Inferior Packaging,"This season of 24 wasn't my favorite, but was much better than the horrible sixth season. My two star rating is due to the substandard packaging. All 6 discs are shoe-horned into one standard DVD case. Based on the intelligence-insulting ""Going Green"" spots that aired during the show's commercial breaks, I assume the limited packaging is to help the environment. It's not going to, because the discs arrived dislodged and scratched and I am returning it for a replacement. In the end, more gas, more boxes, more fumes, and I'm laughing at the ""going green"" delusion.Go Al Gore! inferior products are the answer to the great climate ""crisis."""
5,Awesome!,"This season is so worth your time. The set is a great addition to the other seasons of 24. With such a great price-tag, why not?"
5,Intensity x10,"As 24 continues to be impressive with the writing and longevity, Southerland has marked his name in the anals of TV history with 24. Excellent series!"
4,Surprises this season,"The addition of Tony Almeida and his ""bad guy"" attitude has renewed interest on this series."
2,Worst season yet,"I am a huge 24 fan and have loved every minutes of seasons 1-5. Seasons 6 and 7 have felt a little tired. It is painfully obvious that even the writers didn't like where they were going with this season. It even seemed a little aimless at times. If you are new to the series, I recommend starting with seasons 1-3."
4,Cant Jack ever catch a break?,Who would want to be this guy... Your first season should have told the viewer that working for any agency like this would really suck... at every turn your about to be arrested for doing your job... better yet killed... even the office people are getting fired on a daily basis and arrested.. geeze where do i sign... This season has Jack back in action and at deaths door at every turn.. no friends or people that can trust him... even after his many years of service.. I feel so bad for the guy... keep us safe Jack!
4,More 24,"24 continues to deliver full on action, with the usual twists and turns in the plot to keep us hooked. Keifer Sutherland remains at the centre of the action and his ""whatever it takes"" approach is debated by those in authority, with predictable results. Watching this on DVD makes it easier to keep track of everyone, rather than watching one show a week. If you liked the other series, you'll like this one."
3,Not to happy,"Seventh season is great. I love this show and have all seasons. I loved the packing but was disappointed with the DVD's quality. However, I did not have any problem to get replacement. Thank you Amazon, I am your loyal customer."
4,Series 7 of 24,This is an excellent series of 24 that matches the excitement of the previous six series. However the DVDs don't appear to be compatible with my TV (we live in Spain) so we had to watch it on the laptop!
5,24 season7,"surprised so recently available, fast delivery, new dnd, certainly not sellers fault I thought this was the worst season aired of the 24 series. recommend this seller"
4,"Very good, but...","they truly need a medical adviser on the staff, because most of their medical procedures are so completely wrong it took my focus off the other events! And if they screw up in this, I do wonder how much else they have screwed up! But it is not a series for veracity. If that is taken into consideration, it is good entertainment and a certainly better season than some of the previous! Plus, I am glad that they dare to be rather provocative in some areas."
2,torture editorial,"season 7 is little more than a 24 hour editorial in favor of torture. its proponents (mainly jack bauer of course) are portrayed as strong and wordly, and its opponents weak and out of touch with reality. if one can suspend one's dismay at this very pervasive propaganda, the episode is undoubtedly exciting and much better than season six. hence the two stars."
1,Stick a fork in it . . .,". . . Jack's done.I stopped watching the Season 7 broadcast as soon as Tony showed up. But, out of loyalty, I decided I should see the whole thing. I'm glad I checked it out of the library and didn't waste my money on it.It's sort of sad to see one of your favorite shows fall to such depths, but at least one can remember the better times. Season 1 was a compelling conceptual start. Season 2 saw the show at its peak, then a slow gradual decline through Season 5, but it was still very good. And then the cliff. I think I'll try to forget the last two seasons and say my farewell to Jack Bauer as he took a slow boat to China at the end of Season 5."
1,"""24"" Season Seven",It's been a month since I ordered this and I have still not received it. I have not had a response from the vendor either.
1,One star only because zero is not a option . . . Amazingly Bad,"Once great TV show has turned to garbage in the last 2 seasons. I personally didn't believe it could get any worse than season 6, when I found out that Papa Bauer and Graeme were actually controlling the world. I wanted Jack to repeatedly suffocate the writers with a plastic bag. But in season 7 a dozen African frogmen infiltrate the White House through the basement and slap the female president around. I was speechless. The final blow, however, is Evil Tony. When Larry Craig was suffocated I vowed never again to waste my time with this trash."
5,24:Season Seven Blu-ray,"A fantastic set of DVD's!!!Love it on Blu-ray, it makes it just the best and I didn't think it could get any better."
4,paranoid once again,"Better than previous years but pretty much more of the same. If you like Jack Bauer and his crew, you will like Season Seven. We enjoyed it."
5,Season 7,Season 7 brought it with another can't stop watching story line. I have enjoyed all 7 seasons and am now watching season 8 the final season. Hate to see it end. I love suspense and this show never fails to have moments of sitting on the edge of your seat. I would recommend this to anyone who loves drama and suspense as much as I do.
4,24: Season Seven,Same as usual... has you wondering who is and who isn't working for the baddies. I personally Love Keifer Sutherland for what he has brought to our TV's in the 24 series and was extremely happy to get the latest installment. Well worth getting imho. You really don't want to screw with this dude...
4,Never received the product.,Its probably a good product but... Although i paid for it more then 40 days ago and it should have been delivered 8 days later i never received it from amazon.com.When i wrote a mail after 30 days they said i had to wait another 14 days before further steps could be taken.That is over 4 days... so i hope i will still receive 'something' and i can write something more about the product.
1,sham sale - just in time for the holidays!,"The audacity FOX has to put this item up for sale is breathtaking. Quick! What's the fastest way to piss away $39? Purchase the Season Seven DVD set of 24, which you'll never receive in the mail until FALL 2009! That's right Grandma/Wife/Mother, the young man in your life is currently awaiting Season Seven on the TV, which will begin JANUARY 2009. There are no time machines available that can provide the complete season on DVD for an early release!"
3,Too much fiction,It was interesting but Jack Bauer looks like a Jedi and not like a human counterterrorism agent.
4,Jack Bauer is an Extraterrestrial!,"Have you ever noticed, as we speed through the whole twenty-four hours of one of Jack Bauer's typical day at the office, that there is a lot that he does NOT do. For example, he never EATS, he of course never SLEEPS, he does not even have a GLASS OF WATER, he does not - perish forbid! - go to the TOILET... Should he venture into such a commonplace location, it will be in order to have yet another of his deadly fights! He does not go to the restaurant to EAT like the rest of us either. No! He only goes there to have a royal shootout with terrorists. No kidding! There is less action in one of my DECADES than there is for Jack Bauer in a single DAY at the office. I tell you this guy is not quite like us! Presently I doubt that he is truly human... You see, I have deducted that he is really an Extraterrestrial. His species only lives ten days, so they have to pack everything into a day! Watch 24 to get the idea. And get ready for another-lifetime-in-a-day season 8!"
3,Uneven season,"While this season had some very good, heart stopping moments (Jon Voight is A+), there were just as many ""oh come on!"" moments. ****SPOILER TALK -- DON'T READ ANY FURTHER IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW**** Like how do you go from estranged daughter to Chief of Staff in 20 minutes? Oh come on. Swimming underneath DC to break into the White House? Oh come on. Definitely not one of the better seasons, but certainly better than the last two. Strong writing, but could have developed Jack's psychological battle with his inner demons better. It was so close, but fell short. Could have been great; pretty so-so. Wasn't left wanting more."
4,Pretty good so far,"Season Seven is pretty good so far. It's not as good as Seasons Four and Five, but way better than Season Six, which was the worst of the batch."
2,24 x 7,"With this receipt my collection now includes seven seasons. So then why were seasons 1 - 6 delivered as a box set, one per season, but season 7 came as 6 individual DVD's in six individual cases. I suppose they all watch the same but they look aesthetically lousy on the shelf next to the other seasons."
2,7th Season of 24,"We purchased a used set of the 7th season of 24 from Amazon. It was fine until the last two disks, which each had scratched areas and we had to skip large portions of the story to bypass the damaged sections. Unfortunately, the damage on the last disk was near the end so we were left guessing how the 7th season ended."
2,"the dumbest ""24"" ever","Execution: 5 Stars (as usual)Story: - 50 starsBy far the dumbest ""24"" so far. The story has so many mindboggling holes thatthey should receive some kind of negative award for it.Hopefully they will completely revamp it for Season 8.I simply cannot tolerate another ""you have no choice"" from Jack Bauer.Only buy this one if you`re a real hardcore 24 fan.All other season are much better. Especially 1 & 2 of course"
1,24 Season Seven,"I never received my merchandise. I do not understand how a product was shipped 9/23/09 but never received. I will never use Michael Corset and to date, I have not made up my mind as to whether I will use Amazon.com. again."
1,Widescreen??,Give me a break! Widescreen?? I pre-ordered this item. I would have never guessed that it would show up in widescreen. The tops of the actors heads are often cut off. Why do this?I am getting so annoyed by this format and I'm only on the first episode!
2,product was rated incorrectly,"Item overrated!!! The seller stated the item was in ""Very Good"" condition. But the facts are that I am missing two of the cases. The seller just doubled-up the other discs in the other cases. Discs #4 had visible scratches upon it. When played, the disc froze in my DVD player. I was able to surpass that area of the program. But to me if something is rated this high there should be no problems with the product. That is not the case here!"
3,Not all the discs worked,Season 5 and 6 were in mint condition. Season 7 had a few bad discs that didnt play. I had to watch some episodes on netflIx because of that.
5,Great!,"thank you- we are enjoying the series ""24""- we did watch it when it was on tv originally,but it is just as exciting the second time around! there will never be a show as exciting as ""24"" hands down!"
4,good series,"- love 24. I'm an official collector. Maybe I'm biased, but its been they only series that has ""hooked"" me since""v"""
5,24;Season seven,"I like ""24"" a lot.So I wanted to have season 7 to my collection.The product came i perfect condition and it was deliverd to my house in a very short time after the purchased."
4,love me some man soap,"still one of the most entertaining shows on television, but not in the weekly format. the show has to be viewed in a dvd or dvr format where you can watch everything in as few sittings as possible. if you have a week between episodes to think about all the flaws in the show you'll stop watching. however flaws and all, once you're in you can't stop watching. crazy, over-the-top, unbelievable, and all-too-real - - - nothing compares to the show. it's the perfect male soap opera. my only problem? jack didn't say dammit nearly enough."
5,Excellent!,"Probably the best $26 I've ever spent on entertainment. If you are a fan of 24 then you will love this season. If you've never seen 24, then this will surely hook you in. Follow the adventure of America's greatest hero: Jack Bauer! He's unstoppable!I watched the entire season in just one weekend! I highly recommend it."
2,Broken and not working,I have stated before that when the product arrived the holder for the DVD's was broken. I was lied to and told I would be sent a new holder. It never happened.When I played the DVD's the disc #6 would not play properly and I had to skip much of it in order to see any of that disc. As I said before I WILL NOT BE PURCHASINGANY MORE ITEMS FROM YOU.
1,Self Praising and full of riduculously wrong statistics,"I have read a few sections of this book and I was a bit disappointed that zhukov only talked about his triumphs and successful manuevers and skipped failures (operation Mars etc). Most disturbing was the fact that the casuality figures of enemies (germans) were highly cockeyed. For instance, he said that the enemy lost 1.5 million soldiers, 3500+ tanks, 3000+ airplanes etc in stalingrad. He actually multiplied each figure with 10. If germans had lost 1.5 million (half of the their original total strength that attacked russia)men in stalingrad they would not have left much to fight with. It could have been called 'Destruction of Army Group South' but we all know that all the South group was not totally destoyed in Stalingrad."
4,Goofy is what goofy does,"Given the state of the modern evangelical church, it is about high time someone had a high time with all the goofiness. Nathan Wilson does just that. If you liked Left Behind, you'll hate Right Behind. But if you thought Left Behind should have been left behind, you may find yourself on the floor. Mr. Wilson's best moments are in his mockery of bad writing. Having sampled some of Mr. Wilson's other attempts at literary acumen, I know he can put together a worthy sentence. In a couple of spots in Right Behind, he almost slips out of character and writes something worth reading, but he quickly retreats into the genre and gives us something wonderfully bad to laugh at. By the early indications, the right people will be mad at this book and the rest will be holding on to their appendix. It's worth the money. Have a laugh."
4,Right in step with Right behind,"""I laughed all the way through this book,"" I said.""Is it really that funny?"" my wife said.""Yes, I said.""""Why did you say 'I said'?"" she said.""You will have to read the book to find out,"" I said. ""You will also find out lots of other interesting stuff, like what happens to your dental fillings and clothes when you are Raptured,"" I also said.I heartily recommend this book. It will make you laugh, even if you haven't read _Left Behind_. When you are ready to read something serious again, get a copy of Gary DeMar's _End Times Fiction_."
5,what a riot!,"I love the Left Behind Series.I even agree with it's view on the end times.While MOST who are against the LB Series are down right nasty to followers, and though most of them are merely capatalizing their whiny butts into their moment in the spotlight, THIS book is totally different.YES, this is a spoof, and YES the author disagrees with the writers of LB. But even in the end, you can tell there is still respect amongst fellow believers (something anti-LBers usually don't have.)This book is a hillarious parody. I suggest even if, like me, you DO agree with the LB series."
5,upright funny,"this is a really funny book, i was luaghing non-stop.great read.i suggest u read left behind though bc if you don't u won't be ""in"" on some of the stuff and it'll be upright boringbut funny book"
1,Right Behind: A Parody,"There is a fine line between satire and sneering, and Wilson has crossed it. The result is not even particularly funny. He would profit from studying the works of those papists Chesterton and Ronald Knox (or Swift, for that matter)."
4,"A taut, suspenseful novel","If you want a page-turner that is sure to leave you guessing, GET this book....You will want to buy his others just to see if he can keep up his skills. :-)"
5,VALENTINE,"THIS WAS THE FIRST BOOK I EVER READ WHEN I STARTED READING FOR FUN, SO FAR THIS IS THE SECOND BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ...THE FIRST ONE WAS THE BIG PICTURE BY DOUGLAS KENNEDY........"
1,Load of Crap,"One of the worst books I've ever read. He wrote it hoping to get a movie -- just plot and action--NO character development. He's supposed to be a novelist. Let me tell you, I've read much, much better non-fiction crime writers; books that aren't novels but read like novels. I'm so glad I paid only 1 cent for the book. We should demand more from our writers."
3,Fast Reading/Unfair ending,This book was fast reading and did have a surprise ending. I felt it was a surprise that came from not being given enough information or hints to have ever been able to solve the mystery. Very unfair to the reader. Quite a disappointing ending.
4,"Well, I had to read it to see how it ended . . .",". . . which is saying something, isn't it? Savage knows how to plot a story that keeps you on your toes. There is only a real ""twist"" at the end of the story that I genuinely didn't see coming & since I'm a fairly intelligent guy, I was a little disappointed with myself. :)If you're looking for a quick read that will get you through a four hour flight, this is a perfect candidate. Not too much deep thinking, not too gory for the most part, and good at keeping your attention."
1,A book that is to writing what McDonald's is to food.,"It's difficult to know how to read a book like VALENTINE. If you read it as literature, it fails at every point. Clearly, its intention is that it be pure genre, but does genre necessitate badness? From the minute you read the protagonist's name, which is right out of soap operas or romance novels, and follow her mannered, mechanical thoughts, you feel that you're reading about purely manufactured people. Even if the ending is a surprise, there is no suspense, because the story and characters are completely contrived, and the writing has all the style of a High School creative writing contest runner-up. If you like this sort of thing, then the real question isn't whether this book is ""good"" or not, but are you cheating yourself by allowing the regular ingestion of cardboard?"
4,Beware of the movie!,All in all I really liked this book and have to admit I read it in a day sitting. It was involving and well paced with characters that were well drawn and a plot that moved swiftly. I sorta figured out who did it but Savage has a way of throwing red herrings at you so I was fooled. But I must warn those of you who think the movie is going to be the same. I have read numerous reviews as well as directors interviews and the movie is going to be nothing like the book. Sad but true-the movie is going to be another scream rip off(which does'nt mean it is going to be bad) but I would hate for people who liked the book alot to race to the theaters and be disapointed.
4,Valentine by Tom Savage,I enjoyed this book. I am a mystery book fan and was not disappointed with this book. I'm going to look for more of his books.
3,Valentine,"Just finished reading Valentine by Tom Savage. Not a bad book, The plot is pretty straightforward; a geek with some mental issues gets screwed over by the popular college girls so he seeks revenge on them. (Why the popular kids are always nasty and mean is beyond me. If this was their personality, what makes them so popular?) The backstory on him is kind of cliched; kid and his mom are abused both physically and verbally by his dad. This sets him up as a ready victim until he finally decides enough is enough. While in jail, (and I won't mention why he's there), he manages to reinvent himself. Once he gets out, his plans for revenge on the girls kicks into high gear. Like I said, a little on the cliched side. The way he attacks them is interesting though and there is a nice sense of suspense through the book as we see each of his attacks play out. All in all a decent read but I can't really rate it as spectacular."
4,Great Baseball Book,"If you like baseball and baseball books, you will like this one. Great history of obscure baseball facts. Reading it is like eating popcorn to the baseball junkie. Some of it is a little dated (1989), but for most of the stories, it does not make any difference."
4,"Good book, a little slow at first, but it takes off","It is obvious that this is the author's first novel in subtle ways, but it is a damn good read. It starts a little slowly but really start moving a few chapters into it. The pace steadily quickens. I particularly liked the details found in the various scenes around the world, like Istanbul and Moscow. It is clear the author knows these locations. I look forward to his second book."
4,Very Good First Novel,"For a first novel, I found this an exceptionally good read.Having found myself with a propensity over the past few years to put down a book ""mid read"" and never pick it back up again, I was pleasantly surprised to find myself reading Brook Gillespies spy thriller ""A Way Out"" in no more than a dozen sittings. Throughout the book, the authors attention to detail, coupled with his knowledge of past world events, politics and geography made this an exciting and riveting read from start to finish.Watch out Clancy and Forsythe!"
3,Chasing Destiny,"Moderately charming. Chasing Destiny is BY NO MEANS (maybe the worst movie ever made). With all of the bad movies that are allowed to be made, Chasing Destiny is a delightful excape from the norm. The cast alone is worth the purchase. Music icon THE WHO'S ROGER DALTRY-Nehemiah Peoples, DRAKE BELL-Walter (Nickelodeon's-The Amanda Show, Jerry Maguire, HBO's The Jack Bull), CASPER VAN DIEN-Bobby Moritz (Storm Troopers, Sleepy Hollow, Tarzan). CHRISTOPHER LLOYD-Jet James (Taxi, Back To The Future, My Favorite Martion), LAUREN GRAHAM-Jessee James (Gilmore Girls) and Music greats, Denny Lane, Spencer Davis and Carmine Appice. If you like music from the late 60's early 70's, this movie is a must."
3,An enjoyable movie!,"This is a good-quality feel-good movie with excellent production, direction and performances from everybody. It's somewhat conservative--it has no (visible) sex or violence--but it still managed to hold my interest. The best thing about it is the Burning Prairie Band playing at the end: Roger Daltrey, Drake Bell, Carmine Appice, Kelly Keeling and Denny Laine. They sound great.I'd recommend this for any of the gals--including young ones. It's interesting, unoffensive, and a great opportunity to watch some real musicians at work. The guys will like the guitar work there at the end."
3,Love the voice!!,"This CD is full of wonderous songs.......however,altho Michael's delivery and voice is tautingi am afraid its trying to hard to outcome the strings!Too much strings and its constant and they overwhelmhis fantasitic delivery!!Why this more than talentedand charming individual doen't leave the strings toa limit is worth considering! The songs are fantasticbut lose so much in his trying to overcoming insteadof the strings overpowering his enormous voice. I canonly think that the music is karaoke and he came tothe studio and sang afterwards. I admire his choicesof material on every CD but too much orchestration doesnot benefit on this remarkable voice..I await when hereduces of strings on any recording..That why I can onlyrate this as 3 1/2 because he does not show hisdeliverence so as to honor his voice...sometimes I thinki am listening to Living Strings or Mantovanti..I love ya,Michael but will not invest in you.....yet!!"
1,Clouds and Skyscapes (How to Draw and Paint Series),"This book was a big disappointment! I always wanted to learn how to draw and paint clouds, so when I saw this book I was really excited. I am a novice in the field of Art and this book was no help whatsoever. It instructs you to perform certain drawing and painting techniques, but it doesn't tell you HOW to do them. This book may be good for someone who has previous experiences in Art, but for a beginner, like me, it's a big waste of time and money. :-("
5,Most convincing argument for the existence of God,"If you wonder if the supernatural is real, but are not sure, this will convince you it is. Better than Descartes."
5,Excellent! The thinking man's book on miracles.,"This book provides readers with the best defense for thebelief in a living Christianity. As a Christian at asecular university Miracles has proven time and again to be asource of comfort and assurance that to be a Christian isnot to be lacking in intellect, unreasonable, or closeminded. Rather, it is the man (or woman) who is willingto open themselves up to God who is truly to be praised forbeing intelligent, reasonable, and open-minded because theyare responding to God's call to come and reason with Him --instead of alone. Lewis was just such a man. For this,and for the many wonderful books he has written, he has myadmiration and gratitude."
5,Fascinating and thought provoking!,"A great philisophical work. The topic of miracles is portayed in an interesting way that miracles seem to be almost what we should expect in life.As a Christian , I know people that have recieved miracles of healing.For any skeptic this is considered a flat out ""lie"" or some misunderstanding of what ""actually"" happened . But it doesn't take a rocket scientist or a doctor from Virginia to know whether a natural explanation exhists in an occurrence of a physical healing. The doctor doesn't give us medecine and then we say ""God did it!"" We (us Chistians that believe in this sort of thing) learn how to approach God and take advantage of the power he has made to us through Christ."
2,Slow reading,"Miracles: I found this book to be dull and not to my liking. I like C. S. Lewis' writing in most cases, but not in this one. So dull I didn't even finish reading the book."
2,it seemed circular,"Lewis warns about arguments that presume their conclusion in the first few pages. Then -- at least to my reading -- he rejects Naturalism (as he defines it) because it is obvious to him that reason is not ""natural"".I also think he was too slick about the ""Naturalism"" vs ""Supernaturalism"" split that he sets up. At first he admits that ""Supernaturalism"" could mean any number of things (say polytheism). Later he basically assumes it to mean/imply his concept of the Christian God. So almost through misdirection, he gets from showing (what he believes are) inconsistencies with one ontology to using that as support for a different ontology."
2,"Poor quality, right title and quantity","I was disappointed that I ordered directly from Amazon and received books that had a different cover than was pictured, were made of poor quality ""pulpy"" material and one of the books actually had ~25 pages folded over and glued into the binding! The delivery took longer than it had in the past but I did not pay for expedited shipping.The returned product was refunded without issue but I was short one book for my bookclub. Not good.I hope this is not the new level of service Amazon will be providing."
4,Very comfy and cute,These socks were very comfy and cute when I first got them however they dont stay white long and they thin out after a couple of washes. However for the price they were a great buy and served their purpose. I wasnt running marathons in them and still have a few pairs that didnt go completely dingy on me. I would recommend them to others.
4,i-Dog Chill Set,very cute on the dog... but it bogs her down and she has troble moving her head/ears. i love it but i wish it wouldn't interfere with her movents.
4,A provocative look back at American religious history,"This video, one in a larger series, focuses on four elements of the mid-1980s: (1) the nomination of C. Everett Koop, the first outspoken Christian to be Surgeon General; (2) the Christian response to the emergence of HIV/AIDS in America; (3) the political career of ""religious broadcaster"" Pat Robertson, and his subsequent withdrawal and support of (one-term president) George H.W. Bush's later victory in 1988; and (4) the sexual scandals of the televangelists Jim Baker and Jimmy Swaggart.In this video, the fusion of Christian conservatives with the Republican Party is introduced and highlighted.I will use this VHS cassette in an undergraduate course on ""Religious Diversity in America,"" as it unearths the relatively recent, yet deep connections, between the Religious Right and political conservatives in the Republicans."
3,Moderate! not that great!,"The book has some general iinformation. It gives some basic insight into the aerospace industry but not the whole. It is like a fresh up or first time information for someone who does not know anything about that field. If you don't know anything, then Read! it otherwise look for something else."
3,"A fun read, full of facts and figures.","This is really a fun read, covering British drinking habits, alchoholic and otherwise. It purports to cover several centuries but is really mostly about the late 18th century to the early 20th. My only major gripe is that it is based entirely on secondary sources -other people's work. So as a survey it is very useful, but really doesn't contribute anything new to the scholarship. It is also clearly written by a social scientist -lots of tables and figures, and even the text decribes trends quantitatively. For the qualitative-minded, we are rarely given more than anecdotes about why culturally shifts in national preferences occured. These tend to be obscured by heaps of evidence drawn from new laws, import duties, and marketing schemes. All in all, pleasant reading, but patience with numbers is required."
4,Melvin Williams - Crazy Like Love Review,"Initially, I was disappointed with the amount of time it took my CD to arrive, since there were several delays. When I finally received the CD, I was instantly overjoyed with my purchase. This is the 1st CD I've ever gotten with Melvin's music. He has a great voice, the gospel message is pleasant, not overbearing, and it makes me want more and more. I actually miss hearing the tunes when I'm not in my car. I recommend this CD to anyone who likes good music, from someone who can really sing, whether you like gospel or any other music, this is as good as it gets. I'm a forever fan now."
3,Overall Ok,"Over all I enjoy this cd but of course I have a few favorites..I made the purchase after hearing ""Jesus is Love"" which I can listento over& over again because I find it to be very inspirational. TheWilliams Brothers have always been on of my favorite gospel groups."
4,A quick and enjoyable read,"I think Raffles has a good heart, but clearly a criminal mind. I enjoy reading detective novels of that period and this was an enjoyable change in view. I thought it was as well written as any of the Sherlock Holmes novels."
5,Great Cookbook!,"One of our chefs just bought this book. Wow! Not only are the recipes superb, but the Purveyor Guide for hundreds of tested sellers of specialty foods is incredible and HUGE. Many of the recommended food purveyers used in the recipes are found on Amazon's gourmet food store, but there are many others for really hard-to-find products. This is far more than just a great cookbook; it is an a food industry reference work for chefs, restaurant owners, as well as home cooks. You have to prepare the grilled steak, the quail, any of the seafood or pasta dishes, and the Cornish Game Hens! Awesome! And, if you are a cookbook collector, GET THIS ONE!"
5,Great Book,I really like this book. It has a lot of pictures that my 9 year old was interested in. The experiments in it look fun and informative. The material is presented in a great manner. It will be part of our homeschool science curriculum in the fall. I wish there were more books like this one. They make science come alive.
3,Not quite right,"I love the smell of tomato leaves, and I was hoping that this perfume would smell just like them. Answer-- not really. There's a little bit of an herbaceous, leafy sort of smell, but it's combined with kind of a generic floral scent. The smell is okay, I'm just disappointed that it's not what I was expecting."
4,"65 - no more, no less","For a movie with a comic premise not to make light of a serious subject matter such as death, the director must negotiate a delicate balance. To this end, the movie turns out be very refreshing. The two main characters are very affecting and the script is well written with some very witty lines. If I were to wish for something more from this movie, I'd like to see a slightly beefed up plot and character development. But these deficiencies are nicely compensated by the accompanying sound tracks and the Barcelaona backdrop. Overall, a very enjoyable and somewhat thought provoking movie. A small warning - the subtitles go really fast at the beginning, but you should be able to catch up after a while."
4,charming,girlfriend picked this out for us. we almost thought it would be depressing - stick with it and it turns out to be just charming. very real the way the characters relate to each other. we are the kind of couple that definitely prefers non-american romances on screen - this romantic comedy touches you all over in a tingly good way.
4,A different perspective of life,Committing suicide due to happiness. Is very simple and neat and easy to follow. The music soundtrack is nice as well.
1,Waste of time,"I bought this book after reading some of the reviews here. What a mistake. This book was not at all scary, and it wasn't even that interesting! I only could read about 3/4 of it, not one of the stories ever really caught my attention (in a good way, the one about the child molester was just disturbing) Don't waste your money on this one. I'd rather read the phone book."
3,Hit and Miss,"I am not sure whether Clegg is trying to be a horror writer or some sort of poet. Some of the short stories in his book can be considered ""in your face horror""-""Night before Alec got Married"" in which the horror is straight at you and you get a tingle down your backbone after having read it, while others are confusing, unexciting and do not have much to do with the element of horror such as ""O, rare and most exquisite"". Clegg can write passages which will make you consider leaving a light on at night and then turn around and write something which would probably be more appropriate in an Oprah Book of the Month selection. As it is, the best that can be said is hit and miss."
5,Truly wonderful and terror-filled,"Nightmare Chronicles caught my eye because of the cover. Its a dark cemetery filled with gravestones, against a spooky moon with wild trees in front of it. Nightmare Chronicles was like discovering a whole new territory of horror. It reminded me of picking up the first Books of Blood by Barker or the stuff by younger Ray Bradbury. This is one hell of a ride through stories and terror. There's a boy in a cellar who gives these nightmareish visions to this older woman. What she sees are the dozen orso stories in Nightmare Chronicles. The best one was called Fruits of Her Womb, about a mystery cult in a very ordinary small town. Another good one is called White Chapel about a woman who goes looking for a demonic killer and a goddess in India.If you are a fan of the best that exists in horror fiction, you might try Nightmare Chronicles."
2,Uneven at best,"The first thing to note is that whoever wrote the jacket copy obviously DID NOT read the book, so right off the back the reader is mislead. The stories stand alone, and the tie-in to the kidnapped child only serves to disappoint the reader because it is only used as a framework for the stories and is not a crucial plot device, as is hinted at on the back cover. The stories themselves are hit-or-miss, either capturing the reader and keeping them on the edge of their seats, or boring them to tears.Having read THE HALLOWEEN MAN, which I thouroughly enjoyed, I was disappointed with this work by Clegg, and I would not recommend this collection of stories if you are reading Clegg for the first time."
2,Too weird for me,"I chose to read this book for a project in one of my classes. I normally like weird, bizarre books with unexpected things happening, but this one was horrible. My professor read parts of it and told me I did not have to finish the book or do a major presentation like everyone else was expected to do. I guess I am glad I chose it due to the fact I was exempt from the project. I admit, it had me wondering what was going to happen, but it was a sick, sick novel. I'll stick to Stephen King-type horror in the future."
2,I expected better.,"I purchased Nightmare Chronicles based on recommendations in Amazon. After reading all the positive responses, I expected so much more and this book did not deliver. I give Mr. Clegg two stars because of his writing style. Every story has a nice build-up, only to be ruined by confusing and poor conclusions. It's ironic because Mr. Clegg demonstrates a vivid writing style and many of his characters are very interesting. Because of his descriptive ability, I'm willing to give Douglas Clegg a second chance with Halloween Man. Let's hope this writer is better with a full-length novel."
1,Sheesh!,"I read quite a number of reviews about this book before I bought it and I thought I was in for a good read but I have to say that this is one of the worst book I've ever read.I've read some pretty graphic stuff in my day but nothing of this calibur. While the writing style is not bad and I do think that the writer has talent the content of this book was just too gross, too bizarre and just plain too weird to be believed. Some of the scenes described in the book were so naseautingly graphic that I just could not continue.Not all of the stories within the story are sickening, a few of them were profound in a macabre sort of way and makes you think but I just think Douglas Clegg went overboard.Think-the feverish, shifting kaledeiscope of your most bizarre dreams. Do they ever make any sense?"
2,yawn,"Total yawnage! It's been said that Clegg is better then Stephen King...yeah? I also know of people who see Elvis. This book was vioent, but violent without a point. I found myself skimming the last few stories. One or two stories were okay, but over all I wasn't impressed with the book. I may get one of Clegg's novels to see if I like it. If you must read this book, go to the library and get it for free. Then again, this is just my opinion. IF you want to read a good horror book, may I suggest one? It's called ""It"" by Stephen King. King is still the modern master of horror."
1,Say sorry to the trees,"For those that think depth is a heroin-filled needle hanging from your arm in some condemned, rat-infested apartment, you'll love Douglas Clegg.The characters are rarely multi-faceted and layered. The plots are mediocre, standard stuff, bordering on uncompelling. The tone is always hopeless. And the language is pseudo-literate that gets in the way of the story telling.There is a reason why he's written so many books and hasn't become popular. Read this book and you'll discover why."
2,So disappointed!,"I read this book based on some of the reviews posted here. What were these people thinking? I love nothing more than a book of horror filled short stories. I've read Clive Barker's ""Books of Blood"" at least three times each. I held out hope that I would enjoy this book as much as those - wrong! While there were a couple of good stories (my favorite was ""I Am Infinite; I Contain Multitudes"") most of them left me shaking my head. The stories seemed incomplete. Little was explained and I had no idea what was going on. It infuriated me and made the usual joy of reading an absolute chore! Thanks for nothing Mr. Clegg!"
2,so bad,this is to samll for the price i was hoping to see something bigger thisis why i put three star
2,Origins,"Origins by Professor Robert Shapiro. Published over a quarter century ago in 1986. Written in a laid back easy, entertaining style, but Okhams razor could have been used a lot more on this work. As the author admits on page 13 it was written for the day. It is now well and truly past the day, and can hardly be recommended for the serious reader that wishes to be informed as science and science writers have come a considerable way since this book was published. It could be said that this book can now be laid to rest in peace, RIP. Publications by Professor Richard Dawkins now present excellent coverage on this subject.The Hermit."
3,EUROCENTRIC IN APPROACH BUT STILL A LOT OF VALUE,"I'm giving this three stars because the production is so so; it's not the sharp reenactment of the History Channel I have become accustomed to, but the visuals are sharp enough to drive the point home. Also, while this is pretty eurocentric in its approach, I still feel there is a lot of value here. The bottom line is I paid $6, including delivery, for a used six part documentary about Rome."
2,There's More to the History of the Jews,"Though Roth's book has been around for a number of years, I still come across it on the bookshelves of various bookstores. I can not offer much of an endorsement for his book. For the times surrounding the turn of the era, Roth depends upon the traditional sources and usually interprets them uncritically. However what concerns me is that for other time periods, specifically the Middle Ages, Roth writes little more than about Jewish persecutions. A history of George Washington or the Civil War or whatever should paint more than one side of the story. Yes, there were persecutions, but there is more to the history of the Jews than that.By omission Roth's book comes across agenda driven."
2,terrible read,I am heading to Israel around December and am looking for a book to sharpen my knowledge beforehand. I encountered this book on a bookshelf in my community clubhouse. I have attempted to read it on my commutes to and from work. The result: I either fall asleep within minutes or forget everything I just read. It's that bad. It's not that it's poorly written. It's just that Roth tries to do so much in so little space. The way he introduces characters is confusing and hard to follow. I will try to pummel through this book. But I already purchased A History of Israel by Howard Sachar. So hopefully that one's a little better.Good luck.-AY
4,"Alright for its time , far from adequate today","This is an outline history concisely and clearly written. But it does not truly cover the last fifty years of Jewish history. The changes have been so great, including all those connected with the Shoah and the rise and development of the state of Israel that what is contained here certainly is inadequate to conveying where the Jewish people are today."
5,Not into dishes?,"I made the mistake of buying 2 of these plates for there size plus the reviews were all good(made me nervous).I got my dishes and disovered the reviews were right on. I have never been into plates but I am now, I Like this stuff a whole bunch and Amazon will be shipping many more Corelle pieces. Light, strong and good looking, like me.PS Well packed."
1,Flimsy,Also arrived broken. I am so sorry I wasn't aware of the poor quality of the new Corelle products. In the past Corelle offered dinnerware that was sturdy and could withstand daily use. The new materials used to make their dinnerware is flimsy and easily chipped/broken. Do not recommend this product. Also colors are inaccurately shown. The pattern is much lighter than shown in photos.
2,not what I hoped for,I was looking for a different kind with the same brand. A softer kind by sunkist. I suppose they don't make them any more but I have found another manufacturer who has produced a gummy that is soft and healthy. I will be using the new company from now on.
1,Sticks to your TEETH!,"There are lots of choices in fruit snacks and thought I would give this a try. Well, these stick to your teeth when you are eating them. They taste good but not as real tasting as the others like minute maid. If you are like me that hates the ones that stick, then avoid these! What AM I going to do with the 99 pouches I have left?"
5,WARNING! Algeria is not a midle eastern country!,"I really like this cd...as I'm a big Rai fan...I collect lot of them...but this cd is so special,it's for dance or just chillin..my favourite track is cheb hamid...by the way algeria is a north african country! and it has nothing to do with da midle east...cause algerian people have their own identity and their own style of music..."
2,I had expected a little more in ordering this book.,"Being a beginner, I had hoped and expected a little more with regards to the Introduction aspect of the book. The ideas were a little weak and presentation could have used a bit more work - I could have done without the full page templates of the daisy, the tulip and the flower pot. On the other hand, the egg shell ideas were interesting. To make this a great book, the author should have included more examples of the use of some of the types of mosaics (i.e. glass vases and the egg shells) and the author could have given me more of a ""how to"" feeling for getting started."
5,8 seasons of smegging fun!!!,"Extremely good value. There's loads of extras on the DVDs. And there's a booklet for every season, explaining how the series were made etc. Marvelous!! Buy this box of smeg!! =]"
1,love the series,"love the series but i am having trouble with about all the discs playing,they play better in my dvd rom drive in my computer but skip in my dvd player."
5,Smegging great!,"An old ex of mine got me started on this series when it first started appearing on DVD for $40 a season. Happily I was able to replace the entire series here on Amazon for just over twice the cost of a single season the first time around. I've been really enjoying re-watching the series with my oldest son.Some reviewers had a problem with Disc 6 but I haven't had any problems with any of the discs (using my PS3 to play them). Each DVD amray comes with a disc (or two, in the last two seasons) and a Special Features disc.This is a great series, funny and irreverent, and an excellent value."
5,Made two snowed in geeks very happy,Bought this as a surprise Christmas gift. Turned out to be a stuck inside by snow-can't make it to work-cable TV reruns suck-two day marathon. Thanks Amazon...
3,Grows on You,"This is great British humor, but it has to grow on you. It doesn't come naturally and it not only grows on you, after awhile it becomes tedious. It also becomes contrived in places. Performances are generally well carried out and character development at times are strained. Viewers never lose the impression that it is a British comedy and accents are at times tend to be overdone. In other words, it's a good idea to space (no pun intended) the episodes out so there are at least a few days between viewings.As others have mentioned, DVD quality is pretty awful and they skip and have other problems.This isn't something I'd want to own, but it's good to rent."
5,classic,Classic: Just the perfect situation comedy/space si-fi.... Great character development and writing. Starts out outragious and just goes wild... funny
2,Not familiar with British Comdey,"So this is the first British comedy show that I have ever seen and I honestly didn't like it very much. The characters were all obnoxious and annoying and they had very few redeeming qualities. It did get better as the series progressed though with the last two seasons being my favorite. I was very disappointed with the ending of the show. They left it at a total cliffhanger. I have yet to see the ""Back to Earth"" movie but it was so long in between productions that the loose ends should have been tied up better. I would highly recommend renting it first before buying to see if you like it."
1,What the deal on the price of this box set!,"So I have this box set on my ""want list""...I go there yesterday (02/08/2012) and it is $67.00. I think, great deal, I go back today to buy it and the price is $124.00! Amazon you are so f'ed! I see this all the time. You see someone look at an item and you raise the price! Anyone else have this experience with Amazon items?"
1,Red Dwarf,"What a waste of $189.00.I can appreciate that sometimes humor doesn't translate,but after reading the glowing 26 reviews of how great this series is, I was quite disappointed,actually I wanted to HURL CHUNKS!.I lasted for about 15 minutes of watching this junior high school grade of acting ,sets and canned laughter before I had to shut it off before I gouged my eyes out.It kind of reminded me of a 1940 series {Flash Gordon} Like they say Buyer Beware! It would be nice if you could see a sample or trailer of these DVDs like you can for CDs before you plank down the big bucks.I guess humor is like beauty , its in the eye of the beholder,this humor might crack them up in the Common Wealth,but I thought it was pretty lame,lame as the DR. Who series."
2,"Love the Dwarf, hate the Collection....","After playing only 3 discs of this collection, I must say that although I love Red Dwarf, fighting with these discs makes me regret having bought the collection. Discs were mis-labeled as to content, and at least one disc (Series 6 Additional Material) would not play at all. I am very disappointed with the discs, and with Amazon, and would not recommend purchasing this collection to a Simulant, much less a fellow Dwarf-er."
3,uh oh,Unfortunately I also have to cite the following defects with this box set...I picked mine up the other day and looked on Amazon to see if I could have got it cheaper which I could have...but....someone said that the last 3 episodes of volume 6 were messed up and would not play. Unfortunately...they are correct. Its better to buy them seperately...wish I had seen the review before I bought the set.
2,Red Dwarf: the complete collection,"So far one of the CDs was cracked and un-usable, good thing it was Special Features and not the main CD. Also, I believe some episodes were missing at the end, because I remember seeing more episodes in the past"
5,Hysterical,OK ... I bought these seasons as they came out so this set is well worth the price. Every guy I have shared this show with loves it! The humor is purile ... so beware if that isn't ur cup of tea. It is well written and the cast has great comedic timing! The way it is filmed may take some getting used to ... it is not like sitcoms filmed in the US ... but the laughs will hook you! We have watched and rewatched all of these episodes numerous times and laughed just as hard on subsequesnt viewings LOL This is NOT Doctor Who ... it is more a comedy based in the future on a space ship. I highly recommend this ... but if you are not sure ... buy one season ... I think you will come back for more ...Addendum - 12/16/09 ... OMG I have this on my wish list ... and it is $73 now ... oh what I would do for some spare cash! This is an absolute steal at $150! My 24 year old nephew borrowed my 8 seasons ... I fear I will never see them again ... argh ...
5,fun fun fun,"Red Dwarf Complete Collection (18DVD)This series is witty with original storylines and characters that keep you coming back for more. Each Season includes a DVD full of extras including interviews with the cast and, my favourite, blooper reels for that Season."
5,red dwarfism,"I recently bought the series and don't have a problem with disc 6. The disks were fine with my blue ray player though they are not 16:9. I saw about half the episodes when they were on t.v. and thought they were funny. Watching them again and watching many first the first time, I am in a constant state of amusement. Well not usually laugh out loud funny, the jokes are based more on character and performance than on well listen to this kind of humor. I think this is why these episodes stand up to repeated watching. If you like sci fi and like to laugh at the time then you should love this series if not you may be a smeeeeeeeeeee hhhhhhh. (if you watch these you will get it)."
3,Great series but check the discs when you get them,"This is an excellent collection of discs for anyone that enjoyed the Red Dwarf series. There are many excellent reviews so I won't bother duplicating them. Suffice it to say the shows and the extras included with each series were true to the originals and well worth the cost.The downside, and reason I knocked off two stars (in hopes others would see this warning), is there was a bad disc. I'm pretty sure it was Series 6, the same series others have reported problems with. I was lucky to run through all the shows when they arrived so found it in time to return the collection for a replacement (which worked fine).The problem wasn't a damaged disc from shipment or poor packaging as there was no visible damage. It was more likely a manufacturing or bulk storage (prior to packaging) issue as the surface had an uneven sheen to it that wouldn't buff out. I've seen similar damage before on other CD/DVDs and am glad Amazon has such a good return policy."
1,Disk 6 didn't work,"My adult son got me addicted to Red Dwarf over the years. I was so happy that I could buy him the whole set.It came and Disk 6 didn't work. I send the whole collection back. The new shipment arrived at the same time as the replacement unit left.Again Disk 6 didn't work. We tired it on other DVD's and it sounded like English backwards. when we got the screen to move ~~ it leaped, blurred and had squares in the middle of it.Very disappointing prsent. I am happy that I bought from Amazon.Com as they do stand behind their products."
5,Smeggin' Awesome - Must have for fans,"If you like Sci-Fi and comedy this is one series you need to see. I started watching this series in the mid '90s on a local TV station (KCTS-9); just happened across it by chance one evening and I've been hooked since. Due to the cost of collecting the series I had postponed on getting them. Found the complete box collection here on Amazon and added to my wish list for future buy or if someone decided to buy it for me. Finally, received it for Christmas from a family member.If you're a fan having the complete series is a must."
5,FREAKIN' AWESOME,"Most excellent DVD box set. Brings back great memories. Good satire and way better then Monty Python! There, I said it."
5,Purchase review,I purchased first a Bissel Vac and then filters and belts for the Bissel vac on Amazon.com. The purchases came as ordered within one week.. I am well satisfied with my vac and the filters that I bought separately but both on Amazon. Thanks for the quick delivery.
4,Thick Black rubber belts!!,"I have not had an occacion to use my rubber belts as of yet! But, they look like upstanding black rubber belts and I'm sure that the will perform admirabaly when put into use !!"
2,Item as described slow expensive shipping,Item was as described but took over a week to get here and shipping was very expensive. Took a few days for the company to ship. Will use another vendor next time.
1,Doesn't fit.,"The listing says it fits model 89Q9, which is the model I have. A ""bissell lift-off multi-cyclonic pet"" vacuum. There's no way in heck these belts fit though. I mean I've been struggling on the floor with it for darn near 20 minutes. No. Flippin. Way."
4,Bissell Lift-Off Belts,I just use the belts when I feel the wheels get hard to roll. I makes the vacuum work better.
2,Nice but very fragile,"For the short time that it existed, it worked well. I had this teapot all of 2 days before it broke. It is very fragile and not particularly suited for a crowded active kitchen. I think that I'll go with a ceramic teapot (something that is a bit sturdier)."
2,Worked well while it lasted,The Bonjour teapot worked well for the first few years I owned it. It is attractive and the stainless steel strainer is well designed.However I had a dinner party recently and poured hot water over the tea bags as usual. When I started to lift up the teapot it felt weak at the handle. Then I lifted higher and the pot cracked right where the top handle attaches to the pot. It was great while it lasted.
2,Doesn't fit bathtub faucet as advertised,"The advertisement makes a person think that it will fit any bathtub faucet. It does not fit the typical square faucet. I ordered the sprayer and paid premium shipping to get it here after my wife broke her leg. After trying the adapter, it would not work. I had to find a different product to be able to help her bath.Jerry"
2,Doesn't fit most tub spouts,"The picture of the product online isn't good enough to see that it doesn't actually fit most tub spouts. To make matters worse, read the fine print - most sellers won't accept returns of this item for ""hygiene reasons"" - even if you didn't open the package. If you do get them to accept a return, you'll pay the return postage and a restocking fee. I won't make a mistake like this again - hope you don't have to."
4,Works great AND fits on square faucets.,"I ordered this after reading the reviews because my mother had a round faucet. Once we received it, I couldn't get it on her faucet because it was too large for the opening on the hose. I went to purchase a new faucet at the hardware store and took the hose in with me. They only had square faucets but the associate at the Ace Hardware store put the hose on for me. It took quite a bit of strength for him to do it but it did fit. I took the whole set up and screwed in the faucet without any trouble. I wouldn't do this unless you're ready to not remove it. It does work great and I am so happy I ordered this one and everything worked out as it did. You may want to remove your faucet to attach the hose and then push it up on the faucet as far as it will go. You will get a nice strong stream of water from it."
1,Doesn't fit,I was excited about the idea and the price of this product but it doesn't fit and returning it would be too much of a hassle and too expensive.
1,Changed my Mind,"I was considering this item and really was happy to have found it. I read the reviews from other users and I am glad I did. My tub has a rectangular nozzle! So I am not going to order.See, people CAN make a difference!"
3,fine,this book was the best out of all that i purchased from amazon for school because it was in the best condition. it looked brand new!
1,Idiotic Soft-Porn,"Caldwell's most acclaimed work, this novel is idiotic soft-porn. The plot and events portrayed are absurd. Caldwell's novels sold so well in the 30s due to the book-buying public's preconceived notions and prejudices regarding Southern social life. America's intellectual elite bought Caldwell's lies for a while but he fortunately faded from view after World War Two, reduced to writing even worse soft-porn."
3,"Some consider it a classic, I don't.","I give God's Little Acre 3 stars for it's place in literature, history, and an interesting set up for the story. Other than that, I feel that it did not meet it's potential.The varied themes of race, poverty, social classes, ignorance, identity, and relationships were set for a magnificent statement. Yet, it seems like the author wanted to make a statement, but couldn't quite find it in the ending - making the plot disintegrate to a weak existential expression. This is also probably why I felt that the author was trying to mimic a mixture of Hemingway and Steinbeck styles.Read it to satisfy curiousity if you'd like, but if you're looking for treasures in this genre, I suggest Grapes of Wrath."
2,disappointed,I'm not sure what I expected but it wasn't what I read. I thought this book was boring and I nearly stopped reading it halfway through.
3,Much ado about nothing,I was surprised at how little Erskine had to say. I remember the movie and I suppose it was racy at the time. We have progress so far in morals and writing.
5,Apparently you're not to say the mass while inebriated!,"This book goes through the roles and duties of the priest, from saying mass to hearing confessions and giving spiritual direction and all things in between. Father Garrigou-Lagrange discusses proper and improper dispositions of the priest when celebrating the mass, the proper form of a homily, how to be a good confessor, and how to give spiritual direction amongst many other things. Although I am married (so the priesthood is out for me), I learned a lot from this book and gained a new and deeper appreciation for not only the priest and what he does, but also the mass and the sacraments. Of course, this is a MUST READ for anyone discerning a call to the priesthood and probably anyone who is a priest. It seems there is a lot of bad training of priests these days, and the author makes solid cases and arguments for why certain things should be the way they are."
4,Well Written and Well Thought out,I read this book many many years ago and I loved it then. It speaks to us of our own humanity and how much we give up in our pursuits. Janet Jeppson did a wonderful job and I wish more people would read the book and get the morales out of the story. I wish she had written more along these lines.
5,The best Lullaby CD,This is the best CD. My daughter went to sleep to this CD for the first 12 months of her life. She is almost 2 now and uses it to fall asleep atleast once per week. I have other Lullabye CDs that I like better but this one did the trick.
5,lullaby,Have only heard good reviews from my daughter as this item was for her baby and they play it each night when she goes to bed.
5,Not Just for Babies,"I received this CD when I adopted my daughter at age 11 months. She has been listening to it at bedtime ever since, and she is now almost 7 years old! These instrumental arrangements are beautiful and very soothing. We have learned the words to many of the songs over the years and regularly sing ""Baby, Mine"" and ""All I Have To Do Is Dream,"" etc. I also give this CD regularly as a gift at baby showers. Both parents and kids will love it for years to come."
3,there are better lullaby albums,"This is a nice enough CD of lullabies, but it is not exceptional. There are instrumental versions of traditional songs (Brahms' Lullaby), Disney songs (Baby Mine) and more contemporary artists (Kenny Loggins, Lennon and McCartney, George and Ira Gershwin). The songs are nice and the arrangements are good, but there are better CDs available -- ""On a Starry Night"" and ""The Planet Sleeps"" come to mind. I would try those collections first.Also, there is no decent booklet accompanying this CD, as there are with other collections. Not even minimal information is included, such as the source of the music used. Composers are named and that is it. Could have been better done."
5,More than I was looking for,"What can I say. The music is awesome! We've had this playing for almost 2 months now... every night! I didn't have music for my little one (2yrs old) before now. We just now needed something to help her settle down to sleep. The volume level from one song to the next is consistent, and the songs are the songs I remember the words to (though these don't have words). It's the kind of music that I've now listen to when I want to sleep. I bought the 2nd Album of music as well, and got the same wonderful results. I switch the CDs between my little one's room and my room for sleeping from time to time, and never get tired of them. This music stays on all night at our house in a continuous loop. If you want music you will enjoy as well as your little one, these are the songs for you."
2,instrumental,"Hey! I enjoy listening to this CD, but i was really looking forward to listening to the words!! This CD is strictly INSTRUMENTAL!! Maybe you should think about this before you buy it! Just a little info to help ya!"
1,"Distinguished author, but why?","Upon a recommendation from a professor of Egyptian art, I bought this book in hopes of gaining a basis of knowledge (being completely ignorant of the subject). I must admit I find Aldred utterly unreadable. He inserts commas all sorts of places they should not be, altering the meaning I intuit he is trying to convey and forcing me to reread every other sentence. I think books should introduce concepts inspiring reflection, not writing demanding deciphering. The last straw came when Aldred called a statuary material ""graywacke (schist)""-a laughable conflation of geology. Please, if you want a beautifully illustrated book of Egyptian art basics, read _The Illustrated Guide to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo_: it has a lovely history lesson for each period and object, as well as inspiring photos (lacking in Aldred)."
5,Big & Beefy,"These babies are beefy heavy 1/4"" chrome plated steel.Outstanding chrome. The adjustable arms are very well made.Great quality. Seems to me that they could be made of lighter material. They bolt to the aluminum floorboards which would be the weak link anyway and it's not like you are going to put your full body weight on these peg mounts."
2,i-Dog: a 'not just for kids' gift,"My adult daughter was thrilled with the i-Dog she received for Christmas. Thanks to an email from Amazon, I was able to give her the Chill Set for her February birthday.A fun, reasonably priced gift."
5,Great historical movie,"I knew unconnected bits and pieces about the historical Napoleon. This story focuses on the man: from his arrival on the world stage to his departure. The film focuses on the man, not any one battle.He ""plays"" other world leaders to advance his career. He is a monster, loving father, manipulator and patriot at the same time.I don't know how armies found each other then. Battles do not happen in a vacuum. When the world is against him, he had to move his armies like so many chess pieces."
5,... ¡ A BIT TOUGH TO FOLLOW ! ... for spanish speaking,.... a gorgeous production ... that immerses ... history learners ...into this man's life .... full of architectural details as well as costume design ... in good honor of historic/period productions ......the only mislead of thisDVD ...IS IT'S LACK OF SUBTITLES .....

PRODUCTIONS WITH OBLIGATORY TEXTS ...either ...CLOSED CAPTIONES or SUBTITLES in ENGLISH
1,Poor - More impressionism than history,"Though often visually compelling, this film is a disjointed, tedious, difficult-to-follow mess. Disappointing as cinema, and nearly valueless as historical drama. The fine cast is wasted. [Refers to broadcast version.]"
1,Disappointing,"The TV series was screened in Australia in the 'new' 16:9 'widescreen' format. But the DVD set is available only in the ancient, 1950's style, 4:3 aspect ratio. This is an insult. Why should we accept such 2nd class treatment by the distributor? Very poor .... very poor."
2,"A look at His Love Life, and a Dead Tallyrand","I've tried a couple of times to watch this, but always have put it away in complete boredom. The productions seems to be a chronicle of Napoleon's love life rather than a good look at his history; and the re-enactments were good demonstrations of slow-motion technique, but not much else. The Talleyrand character was one of the most wooden performances I have ever seen. He seems to have died before filming even began.Although the bonus features tried valiantly to save this production, the movie was not really worth the discounted price I paid for it. This movie will be one that definitely goes to the library. I can only hope they will forgive me."
3,A few reactions.,"I think I would prefer to have seen the film in French with English subtitles. The English-language version is spoken so badly... The French actors' arduous attempts at English are very distracting. There is way too much of Napoleon's ""love"" life (or however you characterize his recreational copulation). The acting, with the notable exception of John Malkovich, is uniformly bad. Cringingly bad. As stated everywhere here the visuals are beautiful. The cast is made of wood."
3,SPLENDID INTIMATE EPIC,"In 1795 NAPOLEON was an unpaid general consumed with ambition. In 1816, he was a bitter exile on the remote island of St. Helena. In the years between, he was the most powerful man on earth. This three disc set -- eight hours with extras -- is an epic scale miniseries that penetrates the rise and fall of this extraordinary life. Perfectly diminutive and yet dominating, Christian Clavier is terrific as a Napoleon. Isabella Rossellini is a passionate Josephine. And an electrifying John Malkovich is the amoral Talleyrand. This lavish production is filled with action, ceremony and drama that makes the age and the man come alive.I'm no historian, and experts may quibble, but given the time constraints, I thought this overview of Napoleon's life was spellbinding and accurate in its broad strokes. Better than expected. Recommended."
3,Non,There is a curious and artificial feel to this mini series. It's like those old filmstrips that I used to watch in school. This version of Napoleon's life leave a lot out. The actor playing him was not appealing. The sets were lavish and the one scene showing the creation of the coronation painting was very nice but the whole thing just left me cold. It seems like a lot of effort went into making this film but somehow it just never came together.Isabella Rosselini does a nice job playing Josephine as a ravaged by time coquette who is too old to play that game anymore but too in love not to try.I tried to like this film but I just couldn't.
3,Disappointed is the the only word,"An interest in Josephine was why I saw this in the first place. But I was terribly disappointed. First of all, Josephine is supposed to be very elegant with a melodious voice, both of which are sadly absent in Isabella Rosellini. No matter how well she was able to capture Josephine's passion, some of it was badly misplaced, especially in the scene where she declares sorrow and curses. I'm not against older women, and I do not belive that all actresses should be like models, but Josephine is terribly miscast. The battle scenes were also very fake and cheap, not able to capture Napoleon valor or courage, nor that of any of his soldiers. Dialogue is more often stiff and uncomfortable than not. However, good performances as usual from Gerard Depardieu and John Malkovich, who played Talleyrand. Malkovich was perfect for the role, and sent chills down my spine. I'd recommend it, but only if you could stomach Josephine portrayed as an old hag and fishwife."
4,"Can't Stay ""Quiet"" Any Longer","I stumbled upon this album a little while ago while I was going through my collection to find jazz recordings celebrating their 50th Anniversary this year. (If anyone's curious, I created a Listmania of some of my favorites -- ""Great Jazz Albums Turning 50 in 2009."") First let me say that I don't have this music via this new ""Originals"" disc, but instead via the Mosaic set collecting Max Roach's Plus Four sessions for Mercury. However, I am delighted that Verve has chosen to reissue ""Quiet As Its Kept."" This terrific 1959 session features the final edition of the Max Roach Plus Four -- the Turrentine brothers on trumpet and tenor sax, Julian Priester on trombone and Bob Boswell on bass, all joining the famous drummer. While this group doesn't quite measure up to the Roach quintet/sextet with Brownie and Sonny (few could), it is certainly a solid date featuring memorable performances. Don't stay ""Quiet"" any longer, get this album."
5,Good to have the truth out there!,The Curse of Ham has such historic significance to the history of oppression of Africans and African Americans for so many centuries that it's helpful to have a book that sets the record straight on the origins. It's a scholarly text so the multiple cited sources is important! This needs to be read!
5,A Scary Book!,You would have to consider this book to be a literal eye opener. The author gives several real life examples of Nazi war criminals living the good life in the United States. The authortakes several cases of Nazis who have set up residency in theUnited States. The details of these individuals false residencymakes for informative reading as well.The network that protectsthese individuals is given attention as well.This makes for scary reading that Nazi war criminals could actually live the good life of the United States as normal American citizens. Thisis a book that will make you wonder. Read this book. It is definitely a page turner.
5,As chilling a page-turner as any modern spy thriller!,"I have read and re-read this book several times, and it is fantastic. By selecting four Nazis who slipped through the cracks of the overwhelming post-war immigration, Howard Blum skillfully details their stories, and the efforts to expose them for living the good life here in America. The detail with which their horrific actions are recounted is ample evidence of Blum's thorough nature and regard for history while keeping the reader mesmorized. Even though it was written in the 1970's, the impact on today's readers should be felt just as deeply."
3,Looking for Danny Kaye Children's Stories album,"Like ""A Music Fan"" below, we are looking for an old (1950's) album of DK narrating children's stories. Some titles/topics are ""Nail Broth"", ""The Wind and the Wall"", ""Uwungalayma"",""Squibs and Crackers"", and more. I have searched the DK archives at the Lib of Congress and there is no mention of him doing children's stories. Anyone with info please share.jerrym52@everestkc.net"
3,"looking for ""Remarkable stories"" by Danny Kaye","I have not heard this but I am looking for the album ""Remarkable stories"" by Danny Kaye that has nail broth on it, my mom really in joyedit as a child .If you have the album please contact me at. pointeshoe14@hotmail.com"
4,Party Hit!,"I bought this as a gift for a bitthday party, and it was the hit of the presents! I can't speak to it's durability (so I gave it a 3 star rating), since we do not have it, but it is a crowd pleaser."
5,Love It!,I love this item! I was looking for something exactly like it for a long time. I am very satisfied!!!Thank you.
1,terrible!,"These are the worst gummy sharks I have ever had, and I usually love gummy sharks. These sharks taste like medicine. Nobody should buy them. Sorry, it's the truth."
1,Avoid this product like the plague!,"I'm on my second one in less than a year. I have nothing new to add, but I wanted to make sure my vote counted. To reiterate the other complaints:1) The instructions are horrible. There are pictures only (do that many illiterates really buy these?), and there isn't nearly enough detail.2) The quality is shoddy. The ""locks"" are such in name only. My cat was able to push his way through the door with little difficulty.3) The manufacturing is poor. The parts simply don't mate properly.On the plus side, the beleaguered gentleman I talked to at customer service for PetSafe seemed to want to help me, though he denied there was a problem with this door, despite my reading him the reviews posted here. If I can find my receipt, he'll send me a new door. I guess that's the best I can hope for at this point."
1,"Poor design, cheap parts","It was a pain to install and really needs two people. And if you have a persistent cat they can just pop the dial knobs right off and get out. My cat does this all the time. And my dog, who can only fit his head through, managed to snap of other part of the dial knob. Not really worth the $10 replacement kit when they will just do the same thing again."
1,Absolute Abomination,"We fought this hunk of crap for over 2 hours. We had four hands and twenty spread out fingers on it and both sides of the door and everything kept springing apart. I wanted to quite smoking this week, but I went after two more cigarettes after this experience. The inserts DO NOT snap. You must glue them, tape them, or perhaps melt the plastic together with a lighter. CHEAP CHINESE CRAP not ever worth thirty bucks. I HAVE BEEN ROBBED.This design is such garbage and could be remedied so simply. If they just made the center plastic strip part of each of the end pieces in it could ""telescope"" from 2 inches to 1 inch.I've never been so furious at a product since buying a Linksys router. NO MORE Staywell cat doors. I'll just buy two hinges and cut out a square piece of wood. That way I'll save $30 and have the pride of good craftsmanship."
1,"Terrible, Horrible Experience with this Product","We just moved to a new home. My list of things to do was to install a microwave, dishwasher and this cat door. The cat door, which my wife picked up at the local Lowe's store, took the longest to install, and was the most frustrating experience for me...ever! The instructions are incorrect, and the plastic inside liners is a poor choice of construction, not to mention the difficulty they cause during installation. IN CAPS...DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!"
1,"Petsafe big cat door ""instructions""",The biggest piece of junk I've ever bought...bar none...I guess it was too much trouble to actually write instructions for this thing...pictures only...and they were wrong...Hey petsafe...I know how to read!!!
2,An ingeniously poor design,"Works very well, now that it's assembled. Measuring & cutting was very simple, especially with the door removed and on horses. BUT, the directions are very misleading. The pieces would not go together using the measurements in the directions. We had to recut and try to install 3 times for the pieces to fit properly. It took 3 hours to make this work. We had to use tape to hold the pieces together. We could not make it work without the tape. There is no way to remove the tape, so it is visible. We built our own house and yet this was a challenge. An ingeniously poor design."
1,Poor quality!,"This product is difficult to install, and is easily broken by animals using it. It is for my cat, but my dog"
2,"Oversized frame, won't close.","We were installing new doors and our cat has gained some weight, so we bought this and had the contractor install it in the new door. No complaints from him on the installation end, but it won't close. It's always open at least 2 inches and stays there unless we push it closed. Also, the frame is huge - way bigger than it needs to be - and looks unsightly on a nice paneled door. Luckily, it's on an interior door (so the dog can't get to the cat's food and litter box) so the non-closing isn't a HUGE issue. It's just plain ugly and doesn't work as it should."
1,"Ridiculous Assembly, Shoddy Fit","There's not a single piece that fits well in the entire construction. It took two people, an hour, and a lot of duct tape just to get this into the door.You're expected to cut down the 'tunnel' plastic (in two poorly-fitting pieces) to the width of your door, however this destroys the lip that catches in the plastic adapter pieces, meaning it won't hold nicely without tape. The adapter pieces don't catch on the door pieces at all, and pop right off without constant pressure. Once you've got it sufficiently secured with duct tape to actually put the bolts through, there is no room even with needle-nose pliers, to hold the nuts in place while tightening... which I suppose is a blessing because if you overtighten it, it'll compress the tunnel and prevent the door from opening.... and the last figure in the instructions shows you taking a hacksaw to the overlength bolts to make it flush. No joke."
1,Nearly impossible to install ~ Amazon should stop selling it!,"I had a friend of mine, a custom home builder, come over to my house to install this cat door. I watched in agony as he worked for almost 2 hours to complete the job. He said that it was much easier installing tile and wood floors in his homes than to install this simple device. I felt so guilty as I watched him repeatedly try to attach this flap to the door. In all the years that I've known him, this was the first time I've ever heard him swear. When he finally completed the job, the door worked just fine, but I still give it just 1 star due to the nearly impossible task of installing it. My advice to anyone contemplating purchasing this is, don't."
1,"I already cut the whole, now what?","Ok, I am a pretty handy guy. I own all the tools mentioned in the lame instructions.You better have a third arm equipped with multiple hands coming out of your chest if you are going to install this piece of crap!Here is what I did. With a small soldering iron melt off what look like some type of mold release points all along the inside of the clear plastic trim rings. At least then they fit without popping off. Now use 5 minute epoxy to permanently attach them to the outside trims. Now push the small tunnel plastic into one side after trimming about a 3/16 inch piece off of small flat side so it won't pop out.Now nest the whole assembled half into door and measure it so you can cut the tunnel to size. Directions are wrong. If you cut it same size as door you will be 1/8 to 1/4 off depending on how well you did at putting clear tunnel retainer on trims. Now bolt it together using three hands."
1,completely useless product,As the other reviewers stated this product is junk. It is near impossible to assemble and the instructions are just plain wrong. I can't imagine the person that designed this ever actually tried to assemble it. This product doesn't even deserve one star. Save yourself the headache and do not buy it.
2,Very poorly designed,"As noted with other reviewers, this door is virtually impossible for one person to install. The materials are adequate (just), but trying to line up the five different parts and sandwich them together is a real challenge.You have two outside pieces, and a plastic bracket that supposedly fits over each of the outside pieces, and then the liner that goes between them. The plastic brackets *barely* fit, and once I got them on, the slightest bump would cause them to fall off. With the help of another adult, I finally finessed all the pieces together.Then you get to work with the screws. The package comes with 3 lengths, but trying to get the proper length for your door is a challenge. In addition, the nuts are supposed to sit inside a hexagonal recess on one side of the door, while you are trying to push and turn the screws from the other side. I also inadvertently overtighted one screw and cracked the plastic on both the inside and outside.I can't recommend this product to anyone."
1,Bad design - BUYER BEWARE,"I wish that there was a court that made the inventors of bad products attempt to assemble their pieces of junk before a jury.This ill designed product will cause you pain and heartache, especially when you realize that you just cut a hole in your perfectly good door.The inner plastic spacer and the frame it is supposed to fit into are the main culprits.Do not buy this, it is a very bad design.I'd given it zero stars, but that isn't an option."
1,Piece of junkt,Piece of junk. Should not be marketed to the consumer for home installation or anyone else for that matter every thing about it is cheap cheap cheap should I say it again. I am super handy and this thing took me several hours with all the right tools. Why would anyone want to cut screws to length glue unfitting plastic to the frames tape pieces together and cut plastic strip to the proper width just to put a cat door together that when you do get it together it still doesn't fit right. I too should have listened to the reviews because every thing said about this piece of junk are true. I bought the regular cat one yesterday and had it together in under an hour but decided I needed the bigger one this took 3-4 hrs of frustration trying to engineer out all there screw ups. If you call them they will tell you to watch the video on youtube I say if you need to watch a video to put a cat door together you shouldn't be selling it. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!
1,Where's the ZERO STAR????,"DO YOUR RESEARCH!!! Unlike the FOOL I am!!! I bought it because I needed one and this is the one the store carried...BAD DECISION!!Bought this cat door and let me tell you. SORELY disappointed. When you trim the piece to fit the depth of the door, you also trim off anything that would hold said piece on the side that was cut into the opposite piece. After taping the hell out of it to keep it together and spending a good hour just trying to get that fit, the one white piece doesn't even fit right on one side. SO...unless we keep the flap out, it won't serve the purpose.This is AWFUL construction. And a waste of money we didn't really have to spend but needed to keep the litter boxes away from our living space. Now we need to find an alternative to fit the gaping hole in our door. One that is easier to install and actually works the way it should. FUN TIMES!!! NOT!"
3,Online Website has The Installation Instructions,"As everyone has noted, this door is very difficult to install. My package didn't even come with instructions. So, I went online and found an instructional video on the company's website. It definitely made sense. Even still, they should tell you that this is a 2 person job, when you are finally trying to get the screws into place!! I did it by myself, after much cursing and....well you get the idea. We'll see how it holds up."
5,Great!,"I have been listening to this for about 3 days now. I think this is some of Kenny's best. It is another nice demonstration of his incredible range and style. Stylistically, ""A Song for You"" is more in line with the straightforward work of his earlier ""Professional Dreamer"" CD than his more recent Brazilian-influenced ""Here in My Heart."" Although I might prefer Here in My Heart, if you liked Professional Dreamer, this definitely belongs in your collection."
4,Rest in Peace Kenny,"Rest in Peace Kenny....I was sadden to hear his passing from cancer.May god be with you and thanks for the great music.No doubt your last album will be huge.........Now for the review.Like most albums that he has crafted this one took a few listens and it does grow on you.The songs are mellow and stories are rich and sometimes colorful.The string arrangement is complex and jazzy background is something only Kenny could do.A rainy night stick this disc on and relax.A definate sipin brandy album for sure,but hey sets the mood."
2,Disappointed,So disappointed Waterford Lismore isn't made in Ireland anymore. We were trying to complete a set. Now that's not possible because there are differences. Can country of origin be listed on the product info? Would have saved us problems with our gift..
