4,Does the job well,"Installed this in a corner of our enclosed but unheated porch so we could continue family meals. Puts out a good, moderate direct IR heat within 10 ft and ideal for areas where size of the room would make heating the air inefficient. Allows our family to comfortably dine in a room with 55-60 degree ambient temp. Use of the oscillating mode, however, greatly cuts down effectiveness as the unit must be directed at you to work well."
2,Soleus ms 11 is weak,It's low on energy but has no reach. ;-(I stand 6 feet away and don't feel its heat rays; maybe mine is faulty but I'm not impressed.
3,Missing texts,I love the visuals but got disappointed when I reached page 38 noticing it repeated the texts on page 37.... How can such a blaring mistake pass through?
2,"Okay, but nothing special","I bought this book along with the other three in the set. All of the books have the exact same first 42 pages, which is great if you're only buying one, but a waste if you buy all four, mostly since it's background information. Of the 50 or so pages of actual workout diagrams, three-quarters are in the other three books, so it's not like the book is only for your back/ thighs/ or other titled areas. I gave this book a two stars because I thought $10 was a little steep for maybe 10 new exercises in each book. This books picture also gives the impression that it is spiral bound, which it is not. It has a paper binding only."
3,Disappointed,"Teflon coating is very thin. Egg cup handle gets very hot during cooking and cannot be handled without a hot pad. I bought one of these not too long ago and the egg cup was solid plastic and cooked very well without getting too hot to handle and was not as sensitive to scratching. This one disappointed me, although it did cook well."
3,Does a good job but...,Expensive for the quality. Thin aluminum. Teflon coating began coming off right away. Good way to prepare poached eggs otherwise.
1,BAD DESIGN AND QUALITY,The bottom of the egg cup is rounded so it tips over if not in the pot. I like to put the egg in the cup and then put it in the pot when the water boils. I dropped the lid on the floor once and the handle came off so now the pot is unusable and I have to buy a new one---it won't be this one.
2,Aluminum bends easy easy easy.,This pan cooks the egg okay but every time used the pan and insert bends out of shape. Cheap materials.
2,OverPriced,"I just received this and although it was shipped very quickly, it a very cheaply made Dollar Store item at best. Buyer beware"
4,Hard 2C,"The summer of 2009 after having a Shed built, I had a electrician connect the Heath Zenith Sl-5311-BZ DualBrite Motion Sensing 500W Halogen, Bronze unit. It offered enough light during the evening and just the right brite light for night. For a year it was trouble free, then, September 2010 came and I noticed the sensor was not detecting as I got within detection range. The first things I checked was ""the Halogen bulb."" But, under careful inspection, no signs of burnt or broken filiments, the bulb was good. Next, I thought I'd check the instruction/manual I received with the purchase to see if I could find help there but, it appears all the initial settings have not changed. Since I'm not an electrician, I'll need to call one to check it for further for problems. It was great while it lasted."
4,Envelops,"Well, they're envelops that you don't have to lick. Good quality and should hold up to the wear and tear they'll get as they go through all the machines and hands at the post office facilities!"
3,"Montana,San Antonio,Rocky Mountain,Virginia City","Lets start with Montana,the acting was good for what the actors had to work with. Poor screen writing and the same goes for the rest of this collection,definately B movies,I guess I remembered them as being better than they were. Out of the for San Antino was the better of the bunch."
3,Fun outing for those who appreciate Wallace Ford,the flick is dated and the production was not the best but it is a great vehicle for those into Wallace Ford who want to spend an evening sipping scotch and watching a flick that would have played mid-week when theatres changed the marque every few days. Think of being bored on Tuesday night and watching a good yarn.
1,i hated it,This product was very low quality- especially for $30. I would recommed something else for anyone thinking of buying this.
5,Please 100 %,"bought this for a friend of mine for Christmas,her words described it as being gorgeous.shipping was much quicker than I expected.so I would say she is pleased; as am I."
1,Looks Good But...,"Table looked great, nice chromed steel parts, excellent welds, however...assembly instructions did not match parts received; the relationship of the lever on the table to the rod that went into the stand was not well shown and did not work. I disassembled the verticle mechanism and found a failed part. The 800 number did not answer on the weekend and today (a Tuesday) when I called I received no explanation.Finally and most important when I tried the table next to the bed, it would only stay in the highest position, I found that 30"" is not long enough to go in front of a person in the bed. I checked and actual hospital bed table and found that it measured 36"" inches.Buyer beware..."
5,Back saver,I ordered the overbed table when my husband had surgery. It's been a life saver! Easy to put together and very sturdy.Works well
4,Met my specs nicely,"Sturdy construction that met my requirements, and I like the fact that the tabletop is honest plastic not fake woodgrain."
5,Excellent product,"We received this yesterday, and my husband did the assembly. It didn't take him long, but he did need me to hold something while he tightened a bolt. You should be prepared for some assembly when the item arrives.I love the surface. It is neutral, nice, and just the right size. Not too big and not too small.I also adore the adjustability of height. Wow! Easy as pie. And a very wide range of heights. I love it next to the bed. And it will easily roll around the foot of the bed, down the hall and into the living room, if I should ever want it there.I am so glad to have this table. It is really great."
2,Overbed Table,"Was expecting the product to be better given the many good reviews. The table top that they sent was stained, making it look dirty even after it is wiped down and cleaned. Everytime I would use it to write, the whole top would shake and wobble over the bottom and make a lot of noise. The lever that raises the table up and down I think, is what is making all the noise. I was expecting it to be more stable but it is not. If it was not a hassle to repack, dismantle and return it, I would and get something else."
5,Overbed Table Review,"Quick Delivery, Excellent table. Just what we needed. Good size, easy to put together and sturdy."
5,Great little table!,"This was a gift for the boyfriend's parents. They love it and use it daily in their bedroom for eating and holding their drinks. I think they may even use it as a desk substitute at times. Now I'm going to buy one for me to use for a couple of things. I plan to use it when I work in my living room instead of my office (I work from home). I also plan to use it out on my patio next to the hot tub (to hold drinks, my phone, etc.). This model is perfect because the table top is made of a strong and durable plastic that won't get ruined like wood does! If I had one wish, it would be for the table top to be slightly larger, but it is still an awesome portable and over-the-bed table. I think my boyfriend might want to use it when he watches his tv shows and eats meals and snacks in the bedroom, so I have a feeling I may be buying yet another one of these eventually..."
5,Beautifully written book,"What a wonderful little book. Beautiful, descriptive writing of a bygone era. Lovely storyline. I couldn't recommend it more."
1,Sqwalking Chicken,"I would have liked to give it ""0"" stars. They took my two favorite songs (Wing Beneath My Wing and Because You Loved Me), and made them sound HORRIBLE! I plan on returning it. I thought these songs were done by the Original Artist (no wonder the words are blurry on Amazon's website). Now I know what Various Artists mean. I now have to search for the ORIGINAL ARTIST. I loved the movie Beaches and Up Close and Personal (where I heard those songs), and I have just got to find them. Oh well I guess I could have a friend (who suggested it) burn me a CD (If I get desperate enough).I will listen to the other songs (to see how they sound), but I am still returning it to AMAZON ASAP!VL"
1,book junk food,"i read this years ago and recently re-read it and realized that the writing is very unrealistic. the character daisy's dialogue in particular (her ""just a girl from the 'burbs"" routine) is particularly bad. overall the chemistry is great, there are some funny parts involving nick and the drag queen best friends. great for a beach vacation, then leave it at the hotel."
2,Not up to the standards of Susan Andersens past work.,"This book disappointed me. The characters were so flat and lifeless that I had a hard time sympathizing with anyone. The secondary characters and sub plot felt thrown in just to give the hero and heroine an excuse to act reckless. And all of the secondary characters were too stereotypical. The thugs, the gay friends; no one struck me as realistic. I kept reading, hoping it would improve, unfortunately it never did."
2,Hard to even finish,"First of all, I had a problem with the way Nick left Daisy after taking her virginity in the beginning of the book, never to speak to her again, very callous, huh? Then, years later, they meet and he hires her to be his bodyguard. Someone does a person like this and they expect to trust them to guard their life! Not to mention the guy kept calling her Blondie really annoyed me a lot. I mean she does have a name. She was annoying too. Of course the sparks started flying and they made it several times, in vast detail, but it was very empty and unloving and unsexy. After every time she was like 'don't tell me you love me' blah blah and by the time it finally got real, it felt forced. I like slow buildup and true tension and chemistry and this book, in my opinion had neither."
2,Disappointing,"Nine years after a one night stand that ended badly, Nick Coltrane and Daisy Parker meet again. This time, he's asking her for help.After taking compromosing photos of a very influential man Nick turns to Daisy's security agency for her to act as his body guard. Unfortunately their feelings for eachother keep getting in the way.Usually I like Susan Andersen's Baby series, this time I did not. Nick was annoying, Daisy was more annoying and the two seemed to only have sex between them. Boring. I hope her next book is better."
3,"This author isn't ""doing it"" for me anymore!","This was my 3rd book in her BABY series to read and I've probably had enough of her. Two formulae used in romance are bugging me more and more and this author uses both of them. (1) Woman falling in love with man from her youth upon whom she had crush back then. (2) Tons of mental lusting that the characters go through, especially the male. You fervidly start hoping that they ""get it on"" ASAP so you don't have to keep reading the mental lusting ad nauseum. Although it was probably only a 2 star book for me, I'm giving it a 3 because I think those factors bother me a lot more than they will most romance readers."
5,If I could give it 10 * I would,"The very best of the Baby books! I've only had this book a month, and already I've read it twice. There is a great give and take between the characters that keeps you reading to the last page. There is a flaw in the plot, but it is more than made up for by the great relationships, strong characters, and snappy lines.Daisy is strong and independant, and for once an author didn't put a female lead in a tough profession, and then have the hero rescue her. Nick hired her to protect him, and protect him she did.Nick was also a great character. Life changed him from a spoiled rich boy into a working man. He is cautious, but once he makes up his mind, WOW, does he ever try to show his love. That is, if Daisy doesn't kill the FTD delivery man before she gets the message."
3,"GOOD, BUT NOT HER BEST",I like Susan Andersen's brand of humor and sexy stories. This book is pretty good but the plot didn't appeal to me as much as SA's other other BABY books. It was my least favorite but still worthy. I'd buy a used copy though.
3,Not your average romance,"This is my first Susan Andersen book to read. Although I would have to say I found the author's style of writing in this particular book on the humorous side, it wasn't romance in the usual manner. I doubt any man in his right man would want to depend on a woman for physical protection, although I know there are women who are capable. We're talking how this made Nick look to the female fans of Andersen(at least for me). She made him him look like a wimp right off the bat, which was a turnoff for me to start with. They were jumping into sex too often and didn't leave room for much of a story plot. Everyone likes sex in a romance novel, but this one went to extremes. About the only thing that seemed to be realistic in this novel was the politican, J. Fitzgerald, and his behavior. I didn't care for the plot, but I found the book to be an amusing read and found myself laughing at times. I think the author has talent with words so I'll probably read some more of her work."
3,Read it for the small amount written about Mo and Reid,This book just didnt pack enough punch for me. There was not enough confrontation between Daisy and the danger she is supposedly protecting Nick from. Nick'sister and her husband Reid were much more interesting than Nick and Daisy. I believe I will only spend the money on another of her books if it is a story centered on those two characters.
1,I wish I could vote for less than 1 Star!,"This must be one of the most dissapointing books I've read in a long time. I have one major gripe about this. If Josh, the pretty boy, suddenly decides after all these years that he truley loves Daisy, why does he have to say it like a million times to her? I found myself saying, ""Enough Already""! I wouldnt waste my time on this book. Plot and reality are missing in this book and the characters were too way out there in that boy/girl, shes masculine and hes just too pretty way. I kinda had the feeling the guy was a major wimp! Who wants a wimpy pretty boy? I'll tell you, its definitely not me"
3,Really like it,"I just like Beanie and this one like all other is soft and very nice. I love the colour, it make a very happy just to look at it."
3,Warning,"I did not realize this until the second I took the plastic wrap off and couldn't return these CD's. These songs are not by the original artists. They are all done by the Countdown Dance Masters. If you are seeing this as a ""Too Good to be True Deal"" you are right. The covers are decent, but only if you don't know what the originals are like. If you want something like the originals, find it somewhere else. If you haven't heard the original, or just want something similar, then you can't go wrong with the set at the price."
3,favorite music,I have owned this music in the past and I really liked it If any body likes dance music I would highly recommend this to them.
2,Yet to be convinced,It doesn't protect against bright sunlight (my cardigan draped over the hood of the stroller is more effective); it doesn't protect against strong winds; it's only water resistant. So what exactly does it do? I'm sure it will be a great protector against insects when summer comes but then I won't be able to see my son sitting in the stroller because the meshing is such a dark material.
1,Disappointed,I was not satisfied with the selection of titles in this book. Also there are no pictures but that was not expected.
5,What a Great Set!,"I installed this in the spigot in our front yard so my wife could quickly connect and disconnect a rolling hose reel we have. Mission accomplished! This thing is great! It was very easy to install, has no leaks, does not restrict the water flow to the hose, and seems to be a very sturdy set.If you're still hand tightening and loosening hoses around your yard, you might as well ride everywhere on horseback and churn your own butter. Get out of the dark ages and get this thing! It's the wave of the future."
1,"Searched on ""Kitchen Sink"" hose adapter and got this","Disappointed - I was specifically looking for a connection for garden hose to kitchen sink faucet.This came up and seemed to be what I was after.But not so fast - this is a garden hose to garden hose faucet quick connect.Works fine, but not what I thought it wasMy fault, I guess."
1,dishonest advertising,"This item was coupled with an indoor hose as being frequebtly bought together. Everyone, I'm sure had the same experience I had....it doesn't go with indoor hose or fawcet!! Nothing seems to go with indoor hose....and this item is for outdoor fawcet."
1,Was hoping to only be greatly disappointed,"Don't buy this to keep deer out. They ate right through this. I was hoping that this would work as the price was reasonable. Save your money if you are hoping this will protect crops, trees etc. It won't. I just went out to check on trees planted this fall and the fence has several holes from the deer. My newly planted trees were eaten too."
1,Do Note Buy - Cheap Product,"I purchased this in early March 2011 on Amazon. What I received in the mail a week later was Ross Deer Netting, which is very different than what is listed here and sells for only $18 on Amazon. I received a full refund, but frustrating to buy a product and get something totally different. Amazon's sticker on the product even said it was Easy Gardner Deer Fencing. Very misleading. Do Not Buy this from Amazon!!!"
5,A must read for all fans of the author!,"This multi-faceted collection showcases the elements that make Elizabeth Berg such a wonderful writer. In just a few pages, she exposes the rawest emotions from her characters and their relationship issues. One story was an epilogue of Pull of the Moon, and another story reminded me of scenes from Never Change."
3,It was OK.,"I found some of the ""stories"" hard to understand. I read it because the book club I am in chose it, but I have read better books."
1,Horrible-don't waste your money!,This book was terrible. I could not wait for the character to get out of the bathroom as she was just rambling like someone who is having a bit of a breakdown. Not entertaining...just sad and dreary. I disliked the first story so much I skipped to the end thinking it was all one story in order to determine if she ever made it out! Dont waste your money. Elizabeth Berg's Open House is her best book in my humble opinion.
5,Love Berg's books,Love Elizabeth Berg's books. Honest and accepting of human foibles; you immerse yourself in the characters and day to day lives. Leave you feeling warm and fuzzy.
1,"Ho-hum, ho-hum, ho-hum!","First of all, I am a huge Berg fan, and have read all but her latest book, ""We Are All Welcome Here."" ""Ordinary Life Stories"" left me absolutely mystified. The book is comprised of fourteen very short stories, none of which seem to have any real purpose or substance. With the exception of three stories, ""Martin's Letter to Nan,"" ""Regrets Only"" and ""One Time at Christmas,"" the stories read like the ramblings of a tormented soul. I always try to find something positive to say about a book. In this case the only positive comment I can come up with is ""thank goodness the book was short and ended quickly."" What more can one say other than it was a tremendous disappointment and fell far short of Berg's usual writing style."
2,"A brief taste, but no substance","Elizabeth Berg books are a treat to be savored and ""Ordinary Life"" had all the promise of another delight. All the necessary parts are there, characters who ring true, family dynamics, true to ear dialogue.....but this book falls short. With all these pluses, it is all tossed into a thrown together book that seems more like some story outlines, not actual stories. Each story is brief, too brief and each one suffers from the brivity. There is no opportunity to develop each story, just a scrap here and there......This book is a disappointment, perhaps because I have come to expect more. This is like Elizabeth Berg lite. Go back to one of her others, and pass this one by."
2,improperly assembled,Combined this with the ho turntable drive motor for remote operation. Recommend running the drive motor on 5vdc not 12vdc for reduced noise.Track contacts resemble motor brushes and were assembled improperly leading to a dead track after a few turns of the table. Fortunatly the deck comes off easily when installed in layout.
2,"Close, but not quite","Short answer: If you want to understand how fun this game is, play some other game, and have a friend constantly yank the controller out of your had by its cord.It actually isn't that hard of a game to beat if you always select the fastest cars, but there is very poor balance between the cars you choose, and different strategies. The slower cars supposedly have better handling and strength, but the steering is awful and randomly sticky, and no matter how ""strong"" your car is supposed to be, you can barely budge your racing opponents, while they can absolutely manhandle you at will. This gets aggravating because they can knock you into barriers and spin you around, but they almost always land facing forward. So speed is the only strategy that really works. If you try to bang with the other cars you don't stand much of a chance. It makes for a pretty one dimensional game. If there was a better balance between the cars' attributes this could have been a much better game."
3,The best of the bad alternatives,"The selection of Beatles calendars was horrible this year, and this is the best of the bad options. The pictures are good, but I HATE calendars that do not follow the correct sequence of days: Sun Mon Tues Wed Thurs Fri Sat. This calendar has the days listed: Mon Tues Wed Thurs Fri Sat Sun. Monday is NOT the first day of the week! I can't tell you how many times I've gotten days wrong becasue I look at the calendar for say, Monday, and automatically look to the second column. I forget that the second column is actually Tuesday on this calendar. Other than that, it's a decent product."
4,Stalin Attacks - Then Wishes He Hadn't,"The book starts when, at the end of World War II in Europe, Stalin decides that half of Europe doesn't suffice. He wants it all, Urals to the Pyrennes and beyond. So the massive Soviet legions that helped to crush Hitler turn on the Western Allies. The Red Army meets with some success in the north. But, in the south, in Barvaria, the Red hordes face General Patton's Third Army and that's where things start to get interesting.I'm not sure that I agree with the scenario that follows. It seems a lot like a wish fullfillment fantasy. Yet, in the back of my mind, I wished that George C. Scott were still alive for one more film, this time of the war Patton really wanted to fight.--Mark R. Whittington (...)"
4,Georgie Patton Rides Again!,"Never mind the inaccuracies. Never mind the pedestrian love-story. Never mind the puerile kill-the-heroine-and-bring-her-back.This book is exciting!The things that the chief historical characters do are the things I would expect from the people themselves.Those who complain that Patton-in-the-book is larger than life forget that Patton-in-the-flesh was larger than life. If anyone could have kicked Stalin's butt, it would have only been Patton, and he would have gone about it with the same panache and drive as Yenne's Patton.If you want to read a book for historical accuracy, read a history book. If you want to read a book for fun, read this one!"
4,A rousing good romp,Riveting take on a post WWII that would have altered the economic and political landscape for next 75 years what would have accomplished without the adversarial construct of the cold how many scientific achievements were derived from the threat of the Red Menace.
5,Michelle Yoeh burns up the screen,Once again Michelle Yoeh burns up the screen. She has got to be one of the best martial artist I have ever seen. She is fast and powerful. She has played with all the Martial Greats. Including Chow Yun Fat in Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon and Jet Li's Fong Sai Yuk I and II. There is allot to be said about this movie but I'll leave it to you to see this classic. The quality of the picture is pretty good but not remastered. Its not from a VHS though. So you do get good quality. And many languages to switch too. The English is timed very well but some of the choices of words for English are funny. But makes for a very good Martial Arts movie. I truly enjoyed it.
3,Good but...,"This is a good movie that contains everything we expect to see in a Yuen Woo-Ping movie. Some humor, a simple story and well-choregraphed fight scenes. Nothing spectacular, but nothing very bad. Donnie Yen (Iron Monkey) does less impressive stunts than in his other movies, but Michelle Yeoh (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon) is great in that one. I quite liked the fight sequence with tofu between her character and Master Wong.As for the DVD... The picture, while a little bit yellow, is better than I expected. The sound isn't really good though. The worst is tha navigation through the different menus. They are really slow.It's worth buying for that price, but it could have been better."
3,Too much hype - not enough originality,"This Michelle Yoeh star vehicle is an enjoyable little movie. There's nothing too challenging. The plot isn't very complicated. There's not much flying.Still, the reputation as the greatest female martial arts movie ever made is troubling. There are a dozen other Hong Kong movies starring women that are much better and Michelle Yoeh is certainly not the greatest of Hong Kong stars. She fights. She emotes, but she's not that fascinating to watch.Besides that this movie isn't much more than the standard late 70s Hong Kong movies. Hero is great. Hero gets beat up. Hero has to learn better martial arts. Hero goes back to fight again and wins this time out. The martial arts are a little better choreographed and it looks like they can afford a better class of rock quarry these days, but it's not much more than a female version of Snake in Eagle's Shadow."
1,Utter Crap,"Main gripe, NOT wing chun in the least. The real martial art isn't practiced at all in the movie that is supposed to show it's formation. Pathetic. even the cover is misleading, in a system where no kicks are delivered above the waist. Also, there are far more entertaining movies starring female martial artists."
2,"Cute Story, Bad Picture Quality","Overall, this DVD has a cute romance story and entertaining martial arts. However, the picture is only equivalent to that of a VHS tape (very disappointing). Hopefully, it's only my DVD"
3,Choreographer Wu Ping and Michelle Yoeh team up.,"I deducted stars for adequate resolution and mediocre storyline. Still, it is a must see flick for fans of Michelle Yeoh."
3,Wing Chung Review,Wing Chun is a great martial arts movie set in old China. The plot is pretty straightforward and common martial arts fare. What sets this movie apart to me is the beautiful Michelle Yeoh. One of Yeoh's earlier movies itshows her off doing what she does best : beating up the bad guys. If you like drama featuring old China andmartial arts you will love this movie. The added attraction of Yeoh only makes it that much better.
1,organic msg added?,"i have to give this soup a low rating for one very good reason .the boasting of being a ""healthy"" for you organic soup is just plain bogus.adding msg [entioned under one of its disgused words] is just plain nasty and deleats the purpose of the idea organic leading one to believe it is healthy!"
5,A Visual Treasure,Ms. Ching truly pays homage to author Cao Xuequin's Dream of the Red Chamber. Her photographs carry us on a personal sojourn exploring the central love story and the unfolding allegory behind it. Beautiful and evocatively enticing. A lovely coffee table book to share with my friends.
3,Life Is Like a Dogsled Team the Scenery Never Changes,"This book was a gift, I have not read it. The person receiving the book enjoyed it very much."
2,Intersting but a boring book.,"I expected a lot from this book, but unfortunately it was boring. It has good many pictures and probably the facts are accurate. But it needs a lot of editing. For example, in many places the author states "" it was well known that so and so was in this night club"" , he could have cut down on all these and just said the person x used to hang out in club y. This made the book a bore."
2,Anatomy of a dull book,"If you're interested in the criminal career of Jack ""Legs"" Diamond, then by all means read this book. Don't expect much, however. There was very little in this narrative which I hadn't read before, either in other books or newspaper archives. There are a number of interesting photos spread throughout the pages, but I would have expected more from the author, a professor of history and criminology who holds various B.A.s, M.A.s, and a Ph.D. from St. John's University. The subject himself was a fascinating underworld figure, and what could have been a great read was, in my opinion, quite dull."
2,"Very dry, misorganized","Yes, ""misorganized,"" as there is a pattern to it, but not a smooth sequence. The author obviously did a lot of work here, but this is more like a collection of resources for a thesis than a true crime story, and the author is definitely more of a historian than a writer. Still, at the time it came out I was writing a screenplay on Legs Diamond and was amazed that I just stumbled on this in a public library (internet wasn't full swing back then)."
3,Size not consistent with other gloves I have worn.,The gloves were nice and but I have another pair of mechanix gloves in a large that fit me perfect and these were bigger. The fact that the title stated medium/large made it more confusing for me on why they were still to big.
4,Good As Cycling Gloves,"I work as a bike messenger and I needed a pair of gloves that would stand up to the wear & tear of being worn every day for eight hours at a time. They seem durable and look good. However, the seams broke on the right index finger on the first day of use, which I was able to repair myself. No other serious problems."
2,"nice to look at, but poorly fit.","These gloves over all have a nice aesthetic about them but unfortunately they don't fit very well.There seems to be a limit in sizes. I got these for use in the gym. But despite the size meant for my hsnd a medium/large, they honestly felt almost double my size resulting in them shifting and ultimately leaving my hands with a feeling of irritation.Nice looking glove durable enough, but need overall to fit better."
4,Effective,"The gloves are solidly constructed and work well in protecting my hands during high stress tasks. I do not like the size of the lower part of the glove, as it has too much play and forces me to overextend the fastening system. Furthermore, the inner lining has some prickly parts. An inner liner would help improve the comfort."
2,watch,the some of the stones fell out with in the first three months. I did love the two tone styling and the solar power battery. But with no way to replace the missing crystals it now sits in a drawer.
2,Not as advertised,"This is not Madras Curry as advertised, just regular yellow curry powder. Quality is fine for what it is, just not as advertised. They did however offer a refund."
3,UPGRADE!!,"The Casio PZ860B personal CD player has a 20-track programmable memory, so you can customize CD playback to your liking. The player also features repeat play functions (1/all), bass boost, and a two-digit LCD screen. It is a visually attractive player, but that is as far as this casio product gets. Without skip protection, this casio player has a lot to compete against with other, more advanced, models. As well, I think I got the same headphones on my last plane trip! It does not come with a car adapter, probably with good reason, as it skips a great deal. If I were you, I would go with the PZ4000B, it has 40 second skip protection as well as car adapter. Spend a little more, get a far better product. I give it 3 stars because it is casio, and I have confidence in their product. If you are just sitting around in an armchair listening to your tunes, get it. But if you are on the go like me, and don't like your music disturbed, get an upgraded model. Hope this review was helpful! Ciao."
1,Dont Buy!!!!!,"Look all of you people, this cd player really does stink. $40.00 bucks can get you a better cd player. Sure the looks are good, but after i bought it, the open button broke. The anti-shock works very badly and it sucks battery life. Listen to one cd and its almost dead. I mean I got it some monthes ago, and then I had my birthday. I got a sony walkman, the newest ones. The sound is great and the bass works awsome. Compared to this cdplayer, its just bad. Please DO NOT BUY THIS CD PLAYER!!!!"
3,Some thingz u might want to know before buying this product.,"Here is a list of a few thingz u might want to know if your planing on purchasing this item:1.On most discmans, while the cd is playing it shows the number of the song and seconds,though this discman lacks the second part.Which means, it doesn't show the seconds at all.Now then again nobody ever said it was supposed to,but i 4 1 expected 4 it the seconds.2.When i bought this item,i thought it would be shaped like most other discmans,(as in flat on the bottom)but it happens to be quite thick at the bottom.On the other hand the are the good thingz about it,like:1.The anti shock works great,you can really toss it around with out even 1 skip!Altogether,it does what it's supposed to(plays music)but scroll down the rest of the page before deciding to buy this(or in other words,think twice before buying it)."
2,Not Very Good,"This CD player has great volume and all the options for great listening, but this Cd player skips A LOT! Even when you are trying to hold it still in your hand, it still skips whenever you hit a bump or anything else. The reason I bought it was because I did not want to spend a lot of money when I only use it when on the way to my basketball games. Now I regret it and wish I would have spent about $20-$30 more and got a nicer one. The one thing I say is that if you buy it, you had better be ready to hold it the whole time to help limit SOME of the skipping."
3,Mediocre,"This player is pretty mediocre but it comes at a pretty low price. I paid twice as much for it about a year and a half ago. I never liked the display, the release catch (its awkward) or the buttons. But it functioned fairly well until it randomly started to program itself and the buttons stopped working. The stop button would make it start to program. The forward and reverse buttons would make the CD stop or go in the wrong direction and they would ony work after several tries. It also tore through batteries like nobody's business. For the low price being offered, I'd say its a bargain. BUT, you get what you pay for. You'll have it for at least a year before it goes poltergeist on you, if mine is any indication. If you do decide to buy it don't have high expectations of it"
4,Beaneath medicin tree,This was a Birthday present to someone... it arrived in excellent condition and they liked it. ok? ok? yada yada yada yada
4,Still digesting it.,"I am a huge fan of Copeland, but this would not be the first album of theirs that I would recommend. If you're not familiar with Copeland, check out ""Eat, Sleep, Repeat"". But, please, take into consideration, all of their msic is great!"
5,AHHHH! Copeland's amazing!!!,"O man, this CD blows away all others in my collection. Each song has it's own unique sound, contrasting a lot of other bands out there today. The thing that impresses me so much about them is the use of rarely heard synth's and keyboards. For instance, they use a good ol' Mellotron synth in one song,I haven't heard one of those since the Beatles! I'm also loving the B3 Leslie organ sound in ""Brightest"". Aaron's vocals are very smooth and he has an awesome falsetto tone. If you live in Chicago and get read this review in time, go see Copeland in Grant Park for a FREE show sponsored by Columbia College on May 27th 2004!!"
5,Are you ready for whats to come?,Breathtaking is the only word you can fathom while listening to this album. I can tell you when I first heard this band there was no lag in time which i waited to get this album. The vocals are amazing the music is melodic and sweet. The best thing is you can enjoy it by yourself or with a couple of wisemen because Copeland are not popular yet!! I don't know about you but when i find a band this good and no one has heard of them I feel pretty good.... try it out
1,Suprised at how boring it was.....,"If you want to hear a talented band that actually has lyrics that are poignant without being cliched, go listen to Muse. Far more diverse, and the most talent I've ever seen packed into three guys. Go listen to Muse and then tell me the guy in this band is a good singer.... yeah, right...."
2,Sentimental and acquired.,"I never got into these guys, but that's not to say that you won't. I think these guys misrepresent the genre of music that people like to label them as. Indie music does not sound like this. Sorry, but this is emo. But it's sophisticated emo. The singer is very high pitched and the songs are all soft and low fi. It's well written, but it doesn't bring me any pleasure when I've listened to it. It's depressing to me. It's like something I'd listen to in 9th grade. And I've outgrown that.Personally, to me, these guys lack a serious element. It's not style; it's positive energy. It's just not there."
4,good,i love how in alot of there songs thaey will use a acuostic guitar instead of just beating a electeic guitar this is a truly emotional phenomenon!!!![...]
1,Disappointing,"I had bought this somewhere else and didn't realize that the songs are performed by a random group...NOT the original artists. They did a fairly good job, but it's just not the same as hearing the original artists. I was very disappointed."
1,STUPID!!! BAD!!!!!!! THE WORST!!!!!!,This set just plain out sucked. The songs had no rythymm to them and were performed by people that it made it seem like they were singing the words off of a screen. This set is junkyard material. Stayin Alive was too flat and alot of the other songs were also flat. Dont buy this CD at all.
1,not good,"I wish I would have read the reviews... This was so bad! As a gift for my daughter, she was sad that it was not the original artists!"
1,I Don't Recommend This One,"If...you don't care that these aren't the original recordings (with a few exceptions), and if...you don't mind having some songs represented as the originals when they are not (Hey Paula), and if...you don't mind that some of the songs aren't done--even in a remake--by the artists who made them famous (Fun, Fun, Fun, and Help Me Rhonda), and if...you don't mind that some of the songs don't sound very much like the orignal version...you MIGHT like this set...I don't...and I don't recommend it...even a little bit...in fact, I'm tossing it"
1,Buy Only Original Hits,"Shame on Amazon for putting this CD up for sale. These songs are not the original hits but re-recordings. This puts into jeopardy Amazon's reputation in selling the ""best"". I will not buy the Walmart trash type CD's from Amazon. I urge Amazon to indicate the Label of the CD. This is a good indicator of the Original Hit by The Original Artists."
1,"""Jam"" this!","SUN JAMMIN'??? MADACY records can ""jam"" this box set where the SUN never shines! A more dreadful collection of junk you will never hear. Avoid this one like the Plague! (ZERO stars)"
5,A must-read for anyone interested in the consumer movement,"A very useful guide on the history and the development of consumerism in the United States. Complete, analitical and easy to understand (even for an italian reader like me!) at the same time ."
2,Curiosity Pieces,"Way back when the movie was a hit, Warner Brothers intended to release a soundtrack that included dialogue from the film. It has been reported by William Friedkin that Mercedes McCambridge refused to grant her permission and that project never made it to light. This record, which has been around since the Seventies, contains maybe only two pieces that made it into the film. The rest of the music is new classical: dense, discordant, intense and mostly unpleasant. Some will appreciate the talent involved, but it is not the sort of music most people would want to listen to while reading or dusting the house. Whether or not it might have worked in the film is beside the point. It wasn't, and so calling this recording a motion picture soundtrack is misleading."
3,Difficult to rate...,"I bought this CD for the Penderecki...I'm a big fan of his dissonant music, and so I love Polymorphia, the String Quartet and the Kanon (Canon). The Penderecki pieces dominate the score, and timewise probably take up about half the disc, considering it's only 44 minutes long.I also enjoy the Crumb and Henze piece, although they're quite short. (If you're feeling drowsy and need to be alert...play the Crumb piece at full volume...guaranteed to wake the dead!)I would give this disc a 5 star rating except for:1) The price2) The short playing time3) The fact that it's only available as a Japanese import, and the booklet is written totally in Japanese!My advice is that if you can find the Penderecki pieces elsewhere (I know you can find the SQ...the others may be more difficult since many Penderecki discs seem to be out of print) then I'd bypass this disc.If money is not a concern (and you're fluent in Japanese!) then I think it's an excellent disc and would recommend it."
4,Fill That Vacancy With Minimum Grief!,"Most books about recruitment are either comprehensive manuals by people who live on Planet IPD or they fit the ""how to interview people"" mould. This book is neither. It's a pragmatic manual for the recruitment process, from job analysis, through advertising and selection to appointment.It's ideal for the practical manager who wants to fill his vacancy quickly and effectively and needs his questions answered. Well indexed and referenced, with a lively style and plenty of useful tips, it's a book you can comfortably read and comprehend on the train to work."
3,Reasonable bio of one of America's great artists,"It's a commonplace that many artists have questionable private lives. What Mr Allen does or doesn't do in his private life is of passing interest to me. That he likes younger women doesn't make him much different, maybe unfortunately, from millions of other men (is Rupert Murdoch a classic example or what?) If I want gossip I read a magazine. Mr Allen's work on the other hand interests me very much. This bio by Mr Lax is good for excerpts from Mr Allen's comedy routines and in revealing the movie making experience from the editting point of view, shooting, casting, writing and rewriting. I don't think the prose skill of Mr Lax is especially high but the book's subject matter is interesting enough, and Woody Allen's writing amusing enough, to carry it along."
3,alright,"When I got this game I thought it would be great. On the back of the game where it should everything you could do I thought it would definitly be one I'd be playing a few times, boy was i right. I hardly ever finished a mission where i did't have to play it at least 3 or 4 times. It might be just because I don't play video games alot, but I really don't think it's just me. It really wouldn't be so bad if the levels weren't so annoying. Not to mention that when there shooting at you it sounds like there doing it with B.B. guns. Or that annoying scream they do when you shoot them. Don't get me wrong there are some levels that are pretty sweet. Like one your on top of a building and get to snipe guys walking around on a barge. So if your thinking about getting this game I really recommend renting it first. You might like it, but I didn't. I really think that they could have done better."
1,what a waste,this plays more like a beta than a full version ... the controls are weak ... game play is horrible ... rent it first
1,"Put all of the flaws of rainbow six, add some bad cut scenes","This game [stinks]!!! I was waiting for it for months, thinking itwas going to be the bomb. It turned out to be a dud. The controlsare horrible, and the cut scenes could be from super nes. I thinkhowever the game could have been good, the overall atmospheres are nice, but to little concentration had been placed in the control...rainbow six...hasthe same contol scheme. In Rainbow six you could change thecontrols and their functions, urban warfare you can't. The voiceacting is horrible. Stay away from this game!!..."

2,WHAT A DECEPTION !!! and ... Poor CORO !,"Hope to see the best, the most interesting, the most curious of CORO ? avoid this book ! poor choice, bad pictures, ridiculous pink background .... big disappointment !!! and when you know that CORO did so gorgeous jewelry !!! ......"
3,Coro lacks enough pictures to fill the pages!!!,"I buy and sell vintage jewelry mostly on e-Bay at Kaospf. I know how much Coro jewelry is out there so I was very disappointed that this book only has 3 pictures per page. I like to have as many books as I can afford so I can learn and price my pieces corectly.The pictures are scattered and they have a value for that piece but nothing in depth to take up the whole page. They should have loaded up the pages with the pictures of the more comon pieces available on the market.The pictures in the book are more high ticket items.It is nice to see items you don't see often so don't get me wrong. This is why I was not thrilled with the book,too much wasted space and lack of history on the pages. There is history at the front of the book,but it should be on the pages or the area your looking at.Bottom line is if I had looked at the book I wouldn't have bought it.I hope the next book will be better."
4,A limited choice,"Coro is one of the most widely available costume jewelers in the U.S. If you like their jewelry, then this book is indispensible for dating and verifying your piece. Of course, that is all the book is good for; dating other manufacturer's items by style is somewhat possible, but this book has a narrow focus.Large, full-color photos enhance your enjoyment of these lovelies."
4,"Fine, but strong scent","Emollient lotion which absorbs quickly and is not greasy for my acne-prone skin. However, unlike others have commented, the scent is too overpowering for me. My mom on the other hand loves it, and added bonus, that it's packed with vitamins. I will stick with my beloved Curel lotion, which is also price greatly on Amazon."
2,short life,"I own 2; one quit after a month, the other continues to work after 1+ years. At least these timers are quiet, even when they work ;-)"
1,2 out of 3 do not work,"I purchashed 3 of these timers ..... 2 of them do not shut off light... always on, except for a brief time when the finger is toggeling to the off mode, then light goes back on. Something not functioning right internally, so these are going back for replacement. Hope the new ones work. I have a couple of ""old"" ones been turning on the fish tank lights for 15 years reliably and are the same brand."
2,Doesn't always turn on or off,"I have used these timers since February (now April) on a daily basis. Sometimes the little mechanical/plastic tabs do not turn the lights on or off. It misses about once per week. If you need your timer to reliably work, order a digital timer that is not mechanically based."
2,times are changed too easily,The dial is moved forward way too easily and then the times get all messed up. Just putting it down you have to not put it down too fast or the times will change as it touches the ground. If there is anything that might touch it it will move the time forward or stop it from moving all together. The it will stay on or off till you figure out its not working properly.
2,Worked for a year,"It was good while it lasted even though I had to correct the time every few months. It stayed fairly consistent.... until it died about a year later. Now, I'm back on amazon looking for it's replacement. Hoping my next timer outlasts this one."
3,Avoid if you have small kids,"The red and green plastic tabs that control the on-off timing are interesting targets for my toddler. Unfortunately, then, not only is my kid playing with an electrical outlet, but I've lost the red and green tabs critical for the function of this device. Replacement tabs cost 1/2 as much as an entirely new timer. I'll stick to timers without removable small parts from now on."
3,"Work great, reliable, but use lots of power. Buy digital ones.","I have used a number of these for years with no problems whatsoever. However I realized that the timers use more power than some of my lights! I have a 4 Watt night light which we run all night in the hallway and the timer draws 5 Watts - 24x7. That was bad enough, but then I replaced the 4 Watt night light with an LED bulb that draws 1/2 watt or so. It was way cheaper to run that 24x7 then to use a timer to ""save money"" and have it only on at night. I have thrown these all away and purchased digital timers - they pay for themselves in energy savings."
1,Almost started a fire,"I use the timer for my air conditioner (the apartments all have old ones with no timers) so that my cats can stay cool during summer. Luckily, yesterday I was home and the air conditioner didn't come on. I checked the timer and the everything was frozen like cement. I pull it out of the wall socket and it is totally melted in the back. I had to pry the air conditioner plug out of it. I had a second one but it wouldn't work at all. I bought these things 2 years ago and they are only used for the 3 months of summer.Thinking of getting a heavy-duty outside timer and use it inside for the A/C. Perhaps one with a breaker switch inside of it if too much power is drawn. I check the A/c with Kill-A-Watts and it is within specs for this timer."
1,Don't be retarded.,"If you are using an HID, require precision, efficiency, or being able to use all the outlets on your power strip cleanly without a squid or foul looks from inspectors, then you need to lose the intermatic junk and get with the Stanley 38425 TimerMax Digislim Daily Digital Indoor Lamp Timer, White, 2-Pack for 5 bucks more and thank yourself for not being retarded.The real question is not should you buy this POS analog timer, it's why did it take the industry 20 years to make it obsolete with the Stanley?Now when I'm home alone and set up timed events to scare off the crackheads I know it works every time!"
1,Intermatic HD Grounded Timer,I bought the wrong item. I thought this was an alarm. It turns out it's a device that allows items requiring a power outlet to be turned on & off via a timer. I couldn't return it so I'm essentially stuck with something I totally don't need. Thanks guys! :(
4,Great Service,"It is too early to tell if the ""item"" is a quality product. doing business with Naples was a positive experience and I will do business with this company again!"
3,Mine lasted about a year of heavy use,"Mine lasted about a year with a 1500 watt space heater plugged in. Not so great in my opinion.One nice thing about this kind of timer: I have mine set up to run about 3 hours in the morning to heat up a cold room. Sometime I want some heat in the room later in the day, and manually switch the timer ON. I put several extra ""stop"" pins, say at 3PM and 8PM that will turn off the power if I forget to turn off the heat. This tactic does not work with the digital timers I have tried."
4,These always work,"I have given up on ""digital"" timers. They are confusing and once you do get the procedure for setting them down, they are about ready to die. These little mechanical beauties work for years and I defy anyone who has ever set an analog clock to be unable to set one of these"
3,"does the job, but don't lose the tabs","This is a great timer, but if you lose the tabs that you stick in there, you're done!I suggest the: Westinghouse T00448 2-Outlet Indoor Mechanical Timer, White over this one.The Westinghouse doesn't have tabs that come out...the tabs are permanently in place..you just press it..press out..practically any number of timer combinations per/day....the Intermatic only has 3 different on/offs per day.Hope this helps!"
4,Good Value,This is a fair price for a three prong outlet timer. I found it easy to set up and I will not need to refer back to the instructions the next time I change the settings. If you only use one set point you will have extra clips to keep track of separately. The product would be perfect if there was a place on the device to store the unused clips.
3,Works fine with a couple exceptions,"We got this timer so that the light would turn on and off for our dog in the mornings and evenings, as she gets nervous home alone in the dark. This simple timer works reliably, with a couple exceptions.1) The timer and clock are 45 minutes off, meaning that if I set it for a certain time, it will turn on/off 45 minutes later. I assume whoever (or whatever) put this together didn't line the dials up right. Now that I know the discrepency, I can easily account for it.2) One of the ""on"" pins was missing, but I only needed two sets of pins, so I just have to hope I don't end up losing one of the ""on"" pins."
4,eh,"It's a good timer if you don't need something accurate/to the minute. The red and green things can't be placed directly on the hour and are usually off by 15 minutes or so. If on/off time is important, make sure you stick around to see that it actually goes off. Would recommend a digital one."
4,"WORKS GREAT, BUT DON'T GET IF YOU HAVE YOUNG KIDS...","I'd had these timers for years and had no problems, so the issue is not with the timer itself. BUT now that I have a TODDLER, these really can't be used anymore, since she finds it fun to pull out the little plastic pieces that are needed to set the timer. Not only is this a choking hazard (however minor), but once the pieces are gone, the timer is useless! CAUTION WITH DIGITAL TIMERS, TOO, THOUGH (though I'll have to try them again): We had a power surge, and all of the timers got ruined (and we tried to change the batteries - no help)! SO, OVERALL A GOOD PRODUCT AND MORE RELIABLE THAN DIGITAL TIMERS, but NOT good if you have toddlers!"
1,Disappoinment - stopped working after 30+ days; 2nd became noisy,"Just after the return policy expiration one of these timers stopped working. Amazon is good in its return policy BUT I hate manufacturers that make things that last ""just long enough"". I have had other timers that lasted for years. Shame on Intermatic!!Redemption! The 2nd timer began making such a noise that it is annoying to sit in the same room. To Intermatic's credit, I have contacted them via Customer Service, provided Amazon purchase information, they took action quickly and they will replace the 2 faulty timers. Lets see how long these last. I am hopeful.Keep you posted!Update: Customer Service at Intermatic works great. They responded quickly via UPS and so far the replacements work ok. I continue to be skeptical though of the product itself."
5,reliable timer,My timer finally quit working after FIFTEEN years so I'm ordering another one from Amazon---my Home Depot store doesn't even carry heavy duty grounded timers anymore. I would recommend this timer to anyone!
5,Great Brand,This item works as expected and shows no signs of problems controlling audio/video gear. I am happy with it as I always am.
2,Just ok,"Need to fiddle around with minute parts to make it work. Since the dial is analog, seems you can't set something to happen *exactly* at a particular time but around a particular time. There are exactly three lines of ""instruction"" in the ""manual"" so no real way to troubleshoot. Barely adequate."
3,Performs as it should,I've been using this for about a year on heating and cooling appliances (box fans and space heaters). No problems with it getting hot as some other reviewers have noted but it does have to be corrected every now and then for accuracy (time).
3,I can't deny David Duchovny,"I can't deny that David Duchovny was hot, but the story just before it had me so turned off that it was hard to recover. I guess it depends on what you're into. My stomach turned as we saw steamy near-pornographic action of the leading lady interspliced with still photos of her as a child in bed with her mother. The first story had all the makings of a low-budget porn--rich yuppy couple into kink--sexy maid with a language barrier--posterboy low-IQ'd pool boy. It was cheesy but very entertaining--and very steamy!All in all, I'm glad I didn't purchase this, because it was not something I would want to watch over and over (except a few of the scenes with David). I was curious about David Duchovny so I had my husband stop at the local video rental store. It was not in the adult section and the rental fee was only $1. I would recommend checking rental availability first--and then if you can't get enough of it you can always purchase it later."
1,Giant Rip-Off,"I don't know what it is about this product that justifies the use of the term ""5 pack"" in its description, but my order contained a single 66 mL container of soapy fluid. For this, (...) At best, misleading advertising; at worse, a classic mail-order scam."
3,"Fun, but not what I expected","Maybe it was my expectations that led to my disapointment. I envisioned filling a room with bubbles while my niece napped having her awake to a bubble kingdom waiting for her. She'd run and jump and pop all the bubbles and I'd live happily ever after. But...These bubbles don't pop. They deflate. Once airborne they form a hardened shell to hold the air inside. When you touch them they don't pop. They stick to your fingers until you squeeze the shell, at which point they release the air and deflate. My niece didn't like that.Once they deflate they leave a residue on your fingers. If you tear a piece of spider web down and wad it up in your fingers what you have left is what these bubbles look like. A thin, white sticky residue. Kind of annoying.What they're good for: Stacking. Awesome for stacking. Pick up one bubble with your finger and touch another bubble and another and form a bubble chain.We got some fun out of it. Just wasn't what I expected."
2,just not worth the money,"I bought these bubbles to be part of my daughter's fairy-themed birthday party. I envisioned little fairies, with wings and floral head wreaths, skipping around catching and holding bubbles. While the party was terrific, the bubbles were not. I think these are way overpriced for what they are. I did get the 5-pack, but the bubble blower is so tiny and makes such little bubbles. Ours did not stay bubbles for long, but I understand that may be related to the weather. Also, when they pop/deflate/whatever, the residue is pretty nasty. It's a thick, sticky film that's a little difficult to get off. I feel as if I threw away a chunk of money on this purchase and wish I had just gone to the grocery store and gotten cheap bottles of normal bubbles. The only positive thing I have to say about the catch a bubble is that the design of the container is very nice. It's easy for little hands to hold and the top is designed so that if it tips over, the stuff really doesn't all pour out."
4,pretty cool,"I bought this toy a long time ago and have really enjoyed it. The bubbles have to float in the air for a little bit before you can catch them without popping(I guess the liquid has to dry), but other than that, it's pretty cool! I was blowing the bubbles in the garage once, and the next day, the bubbles were still on the ground un-popped!"
4,"Extremley Fun, But A Little Messy","I'm thirteen and my little sister plays with her catch a bubble thing, all the time. It's great because it lasts longer and doesn't spill like regular bubbles. However, if your child catches a bubble and squishes it in his/her hands it is very messy, kind of like glue. If it does spill, it's hard to wash out of rugs, but easy to wipe of hard surfaces. Overall I say buy this product, but be prepared for a little mess. :)"
5,YOU MADE A MISTAKE!,When you tried to write COMO LA FLOR you ended up writing Come La Flor I think next time you want to submit anything remember to reread it next time.
3,Scares the heck out me..,"Looks great, seems solid for the money. The radio tunes well, but sounds TERRIBLE. The speaker is in the back which makes the tinny sound is even harder to hear. The alarm is annoying, when it goes off it has an initial very loud beep then ""normalizes"" into the normal alarm clock beeping. I nearly have a heart attack each time it goes off! Since I like listening to the radio while falling a sleep, and in the mornings, this clock radio DOES NOT CUT THE MUSTARD. I don't have a known hearing problem. My OLD G.E. clock radio sounds so much better...."
5,"An Unforgettable, Inspirational Biography!","I couldn't put this book down and cried at some of the torments emotionally and physically that the author went through during his imprisonment at one of the many Nazi concentration camps. Sad, but detailed look at life in the camps."
3,Skeptical,"im not sure if this was a real journal or someone who cashed in on the infamous third reich history. i believe he was a concentration camp inmate, but his details are sketchy and overall its hard to read and follow"
3,Not really a Paolo Conte's concert,"Fact: Paolo Conte is an extraordinary song-writer and performer. Fact: This DVD shows some sort of TV performance dating probably to more than 20 years ago (when he must have been in his late 40's). Fact: The recording is quite nice and his performances at piano and voice are delightful (hence the three stars), as well as his short introductory interview and the accurately prepared subtitles. Yet, this product is far from excellent because Conte performs some of his songs singing over a music base: Nice but you can't call that ""in concert"". If you have a chance to see him in a real concert you will be swept away by his performance and the strength of his jazzy ensemble. This DVD fails to give them both the just credit."
5,Very Flexible,"I tried several other kinds of credit card sized magnifiers but they all cracked within a week or two. The stiffer plastic just couldn't hold up when placed in a billfold. The Bausch & Lomb version is extremely flexible so it bends, without breaking, when used in my billfold. The other versions had a round ""spot"" magnifier for extremely small print, which was nice, but I can live without that."
3,Purse carry only,This product is to flimsy to carry in your pocket or billfold. Probably would work for the ladies carrying it in a purse.
2,"Not as advertised, cheap knock off brand","I purchased a name brand product, Bausch and Lomb. Got a no brand product. Arrived in regular mail envelopes, torn by normal handling, and product falling out. I would not purchase from this vendor."
4,Nice sound for the size,"This boombox has a nice sound and easy to read display. It is compact and fairly lightweight, even with the batteries installed. The digital tuner and remote control are an added comvenience. The small headphones that were mentioned in the editorial review are non-existent. Oh-oh :-( The boombox could use more bass boost. A Bass Port on the unit would have made this boombox an ideal item indeed!!!"
4,Landfill Gas from environmnt to energy,"The monograph is a good treasure of information on landfills and I am sure shall act as a base book for the engineering and design as well as project personnel for LANDFILL works. The book could also be very valuable to a wide audience who are intending to go for landfill gas projects, worldwide."
1,Not What I Expected.,"The lab book was labled as in ""new"" condition, which was not exactly true. It had all its pages and looks nice on the outside but inside many of the lab exercises had already been done for me. I am a college student and did not appreciate that the book was already filled out. I was very dissappointed to not only find that the book was labled new when it was not but that the answers were mostly in pen so i could not get rid of them. now as a result my work looks sloppy and unproffesional. thanks a lot."
5,Essentail Hulk Vol. 3,"3rd Vol. if you enjoyed the 1st vol. read this and you will not be disappionted. Stan Lee end shis run as writer and Roy Thomas takes over without any problams.Guest stars aplenty. Thrills, chills, headbashing and a lot of broken big boy toys."
1,Don't waste your time,"The premise of this novel has great promise -- a story about the lives of an extended group of family and friends who live on the Upper West Side.Unfortunately, the execution falls short. The story is slow moving and stilted. The characters are poorly developed. No matter how hard I tried, I just could not make myself care about the lives of these people. The pages and pages of rhetorical philosophical ramblings did not help.This book is definitely not a page turner. I forced myself to keep reading it and it never got better. I would recommend that you not waste your time trying to muddle through this."
3,Alternately engaging and annoying,"A certain smugness pervades the pages of ""Morningside Heights,"" Cheryl Mendelson's paean to life on the Upper West Side. I picked up the book in the hopes that it would evoke the late Laurie Colwin, but I was disappointed. In the end, I felt that the self-absorption and entitlement of the ostensible protagonist, the stock supporting characters, and the utter predictability of the storyline made the second half of the novel drag and chafe. It's too bad, because there's a lot of intelligence here and I enjoyed the first chapter, which focuses more on the neighborhood than on any of the characters. But overall the book's tone of entitlement and pretension and its psychoanalytic fervor grated on me while the characters failed to sufficiently engage."
2,Wanted to like this more,"Cheryl Mendelson scored a major hit with ""Home Comforts,"" her guide to 21st Century housekeeping. She combined elements of Miss Manners, Erma Bombeck, and Martha.I had high hopes for ""Morninside Heights.""The setting is perfect, but..the pace is deliberate to the point of plodding. The characters did not engage me.I had hoped that this would be a quirky, lovable book, like the late Laurie Colwin wrote. Colwin wrote about New York and New Yorkers also, and did it better. Some of Colwin's titles include ""Family Happiness,"" ""Goodbye Without Leaving,"" and ""Another Marvelous Thing.""In ""Morningside Heights,"" there is a predictable subplot about a corrupt attorney. This subplot ends in a ""virtue rewarded, evil vanquished"" manner.The jacket flap states that this is the first of a trilogy. I hope that Mendelson, who can write very precisely, can make her characters more appealing.If there were half star ratings here, I would give this book two and a half stars."
3,A trilogy? Puhleeze!!,"The people who populate Morningside Heights do not seem very real. They have absolutely no financial sense; they live in New York in fabulous rent controlled apartments; they shop at stores from movies (but wear hand me down coats); they have jobs that I didn't really think existed (opera singers?); they discourse on topics that I never thought people really talked about. Nevertheless, whether this is true fantasy, or there are real people like this out there somewhere, this is an interesting if slow moving book because of the setting and true fantasy of people living in New York in an apartment. I hope that her style changes in the next two books. It is very stilted and slow moving. I get the sense that she is writing down to her readers. She seems to envision her readers as yokels reading the book while smoking corncob pipes in the outhouse and certainly not sophisticated enough to mix with her characters."
5,"The ""Heights"" of a good summer read!","In Mendelson's first novel, she demonstrates the ability to weave a web of intriguing, complex and loveable characters, making it nearly impossible to put the book down. Her writing style is fluid and engaging. I'm ready for her next non-fiction."
1,Terrible book,"This book is completely horrible - it starts out explaining solutions for the odd numbered problems very well which is great so when you are doing chapters 2-5, it works wonderfully. When you get to chapter 6, it's utter chaos. It's frustrating enough to have a teacher who doesn't bother to correct your homework, but even the solutions manual doesn't show complete work and very often pairs the wrong graphs with the correct solutions which is confusing when you are relying on at least the odd-numbered solutions to help you understand the material. It skips steps and doesn't always show the correct work - I'm not using the solutions manual to get answers (those are provided in the back of the book already) - so I'm very disappointed in this book."
4,Love it!,This is a very good sauce and easy to work with...use your imagination for ingredients. It's excellent! And haven't found it in the stores.
4,Love the band. Love the shirt too.,"It's such a toned-down statement of support of the band and appreciation of their music. I love the shirt. Mine is about 5 years old and full of holes. I'll buy another soon, so that I have one new to wear when needed. But I'll keep the one with holes in it and wear it much more often."
4,Good product,Intermatic timer are very reliable and well built. I have used and installed many of these timers for years and have had no problems with them. The time is easy to set and the trippers stay put when properly installed (also easy to do). The timer is also easy to manually overide if needed with the flip of a switch. If used in outdoor location be sure to buy raintight enclosure.
1,Replace every year,"Have purchased two of these timers over the last three years, they were setup indoors only used during December for Christmas lighting.The first one died when the mechanical on/off would not engage during the second year of use.The replacement was no better as the timer wheel stopped turning also in the second year of use. I'll be replacing this unit tomorrow and it won't be with another intermatic product.These timers are not cheap and to have to replace them whenever you need to use them is ridiculous.Overall I rate this product as expensive junk."
3,Intermatic T101R Outdoor timer,T101R Worked good for almost three years then all of a sudden stopped working and keeping time. Went to several forums online and saw many people had the same problem as I have. Still can not fix it but will probably have to replace it since it is out of warranty already.
1,Customer Warning,"I had this piece of junk for almost 2 months when both pins fell to the bottom of the clock face. I called the company where a man told me ""your story doesn't add up"" ""it doesn't make sense"" ""we've never had this problem with this unit before"".I asked him if he was trying to imply that I was lying to him and he said yes.There overall lack of concern was stunning. They didn't bother to offer to replace it, send new pins, or anything. Complete lack of concern for the customer.This unit was professionally installed by an electrician who has installed these timers before, and since calling him about it, he informed me this isn't the first one he's heard about doing this regardless of the lies the company was trying to get me to believe.So I ask you, who would stand to gain the most by lying here?I don't suggest you purchase anything from Intermatic, Inc. They won't stand behind their product and are rude to their customers."
1,Buy anything else - doesn't work,"Trippers fall off the dial. Can't get them to stick to the right time. Any Walmart timer is better, as we have discovered. Don't buy this kind of defective product."
3,Another Interesting Portrayal of British Life,"The name Martin Clunes is what drew us to this series; we had enjoyed the Doc Martin series and thought we would give this one a try. The William character played by Martin Clunes is sympathetic and one feels a concern for his happiness; the Mary character played by Julie Graham is also an interesting and sympathetic character.Both my wife and I had a problem with the contemporary life styles being portrayed in this series and felt it to be more depressing that uplifting or entertaining. As a results we do not expect to watch any more of the series. Whereas both characters seemed to exhibit a touching concern for their fellow man, the lives into which they had immersed themselves left much to be desired.My recommendation would be to view it for yourselves as a rental before buying it. It may be you'll enjoy the series more than we did."
5,Outstanding diversion,"If you would love to sit down with a glass of wine and enjoy excellent writing and superb acting, then this is the series for you.... The only problem is it so left me wanting MORE!!!!!"
1,"Thought I would love it, but love became hate.","The title of my review says it all. With the actors involved (Martin Clunes and Julie Graham), this show should have been good.......and with Mary a midwife and William an undertaker, there should have been some great story lines. However, for me it just wasn't there. The stories were more annoying than entertaining. The teenagers involved were not interesting, just disgusting kids, and the relationship between William and Mary was not worth the time spent. Between William and Mary's love life and their not-so-good-looking naked bodies, the low-life teenagers, the high-brow/low-brow relationship between the main characters, and the more-than-annoying women in the throes of childbirth, I feel that this series is a waste of time. I cannot recommend it to anyone who is not a masochist."
4,william and mary,Doc Martin fans will enjoy this series starring Martin Clunes. Wish that series 3 was available to complete the set.
5,9600lynn-This is Great!,I love this series. Very different and entertaining but where can I get season 3? I have been looking and can only find it for region 4 which is for Australia and New Zealand. Please let me know.
2,Mixed Feelings,"There are some aspects of this series which I love. The main characters are real people and very likable; the writing is good; the juxtaposition of his career as an undertaker and hers as a midwife is poignant and thought-provoking.What I really hated was that they rushed their relationship so fast and that they slept together from the first date - and in every other episode that I have seen. I'm enough of a traditional fuddy-duddy that I think it's a good idea to get to know someone well and marry them before you hop into bed with them. I realize that doesn't happen often in real life anymore, and even less on TV, but I still think it might have been better to delay it a bit in this show. The relationship might have developed more interestingly if it had been allowed to progress more slowly. I also was very tired, by episode 4, of the bad attitudes and mouthiness of the teenagers.I enjoyed the show, to a degree, and wanted to love it but didn't because of these factors."
5,"Very wonderful, I really like it","I know this from the TV, and as soon as I listen it, I found I have already love it. Very beautiful..."
1,Not for the long haul,I've had this machine for about a year. Worked fine first 6 months. Thereafter began to frequenly jam paper in an accordion fashion which is very difficult to clear. Sometimes had to use tweezers to remove bits of jammed paper. ARGHHH!!!
1,too many paper jams,"Initially we were very pleased with this fax machine, but about 18 months after we bought it we started having problems. Usually a couple times per week the paper jams as it is trying to exit the machine. Once it starts happening, it continues over and over. It becomes very frustrating. Eventually we just have to turn it off until the roller cools down. Do not buy for office use."
1,Be prepared to maintain,This fax machine requires the drum unit be replaced about every three toner cartriges. Drum unit $75-$100. May as well buy a new fax machine every three months.RS
2,Unreliable,"I ordered a Fax machine for a customer. I recieved the wrong product, choose to keep it and get my customer what he wanted. It line errors alot in the middle of fax. It shoots 4-5 pages at a time instead of one at a time. It takes sometimes 3 seperate attempts to fax a 4-6 page fax. It basically is no good to me for anything but an extra phone and I still need a fax machine. I guess it recieves faxes ok. The 25.00 ink is so little and does not last a month.Not due to the fax machine. But due to how I got the fax machine, I am hesitate to order from Amazon again. I got the fax machine because it matched the item number at Amazon-not because anyone matched the product."
1,Always jams up,"I purchased this product 17 months ago and now it jams constantly after receiving about 5 pages. It crumples at the fusion roller where it's supposed to come out. When you call service support, they won't talk to you because it's six months out of warranty and they will give you a 900 number to call at a basic charge of $7.95 plus any minutes that you keep them on the phone over a period of time. Seems like I'm not the only one who is having this problem. This product is defective and from the other people's reviews, it seems like this product is timed to do this after the warranty runs out. I'll never buy another panasonic anything and told them where to stick it. Caveat Emptor! Now you've been warned."
1,"How to Reset the ""Replace Drum Cartridge Soon"" Message on a Panasonic KX-FL511","Sooner or later you will get this message and no matter how many times you change the expensive cartridge, it won't go away.You can save yourself a lot of time and money (not to mention frustration) by resetting your machine:[Menu][#][9000][*] (Will display P-SF)[6722][Fax Start][Menu]"
1,DONT BUY THIS DUD,"This machine looks and feels flimsy. Panasonic technical support is excellent, but unfortunately you will need it if you buy this machine. Also you'll need an extended warranty since you can expect problems.The instructions on how to set this up are confusing, and its easy to go wrong, and easy to make a mistake in putting in toner.I bought this for home use and wanted a plain paper laser fax to save on consumable costs and get good quality copies.My first unit didn't work at all. Panasonic sent a replacment without charge.After about 18 months of very light use (as a home fax), it started to make lines on every copy and fax sent out.Panasonic technical support tells me this is a problem with a bad chip and it will have to be sent back for repairs which which will be expensive and take time and effort.I am very disappointed with this machine. I liked the idea of a laser plain paper fax, but this one just isn't very good. I'm sure you can find a more reliable machine out there."
1,Panasonic junk,"Purchased a Panasonic KX-FL501 from Amazon.com on August 01, 2001 and replaced it 06/13/02 with a Brother IntelliFAX 2800, which so far has been an infinitely more satisfactory machine for exactly the same price. The KX-FL501 was complex to set up, program, and use beyond absolutely basic functions, copy quality was barely adequate for a machine in its price range and it gave constant problems with multiple page FAXes; both sending and receiving. Sending, it would feed several pages of the original at once. Receiving, it would pull several blank pages from the paper tray, often so many it would jam. Adjustments did next to no good. Essentially, it was non-functional."
4,Makes a great home office fax,"I've used this machine for almost a year now. It works great. It's very reliable. The toner lasts a very long time. I'm still using the starter toner. The only cons would be setting it up. It has some unfrienly menus you have to learn to do things like mute the ringer and set the time. The manual walks you through it. But, it's not something you would remember. Also Panasonic really pushes their IFax service with this machine. I use this machine fine with out their IFax service. The jog dial comes in handy for preset fax numbers, saving time. Overall it's a good fax machine."
3,Not appropriate for home office use,"This is a fine fax machine, but it's not appropriate for home office use, because you cannot turn the ringer off. It always rings at least once, and even on the lowest volume setting, it's very loud."
1,Please do not buy this machine,"I love Panasonic products. All my phones, TVs, etc. have been Panasonics. So I purchased this. It is a MONSTER. The print quality is excellent, but replacing the toner is complex and confusing. I broke something inside when I tried to change the toner (which BTW is very expensive). The support was subpar and not available on weekends, plus being limited to PST.I'm practically in tears because it was such a waste of money.Unless you are a rocket scientist and can figure out how to load the replacement toner, DON'T, PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT!"
1,Panasonic KX-FL501 JUNK!,Paper jams all the time.Lost many important fax info.I can no longer fax out. Half the page is solid black on the receiving end.I just replaced the cart&drum unit.(Expensive) Now this breakdown.This is my second Panasonic fax machine and my last.
1,Terrible Fax Machine,"I bought this fax for light to moderate home use. It has never worked properly. I have to stand at the machine and feed multi-page faxes one page at a time--otherwise the machine will pull up to 5 pages into the feeder at once. Similarly, when printing multi-page faxes the machine often pulls multiple sheets at once, sometime jamming.Panasonic customer service has been absolutely unacceptable. One rep. told me, with surprising candor, that these were design flaws common to this machine and there was nothing Panasonic would do. A second rep. told me she would do nothing unless I fed sheets into the machine and let her LISTEN to it over the phone. In neither case was I offered repair or replacement.I strongly recommend against buying this machine."
5,Kenwood CA-C2AX cable,"Fantastic product, fantastic price...the local's wanted @ $60.00 for the cable. It arrived very quickly and has made listening to my iPod Shuffle (3rd Gen.) a snap on my HD Electraglide. Very easy to install and would use this seller again anytime."
1,horrible,I'll never buy that item again.... it arrived damaged... I wonder if the sender thought I'm stupid to accept the item in such condition.... they should respect their clients...
2,Splitting Belt,Item is already starting to split and tear it is leather but it is pressed but for 3.99 what can you expect.
4,"Nice belt, but not the right size.","I bought this belt for my husband, and while his pant size is within the guidelines, the belt is too small."
5,Monster Turbine Ear Buds,"I bought these for my teenage son, and he says they are the best set of earbuds / earphones he has ever used."
5,Monster Turbine Ear Buds,"Outstanding sound and clarity along with the value and construction. I was fortunate enough to pick these up at a really great price right before the holidays however, I am considering getting a 2nd pair to interchange regardless of whether or not I have to pay a higher price. I highly recommend these ear buds for that consumer who like me has gone thru enough of the $15 and $20 buds and wants a really great pair that will last."
2,"Good sound, Bad construction","I used to be a avid BOSE earphone user. I absolutely loved their product until it started breaking down and I was sick of replacing it through their warranty program. Ever since then I gave Monster a try and to my surprise, the sound quality is actually better in the sense that the mids and lows are more crisp than my previous BOSE set.But unfortunately much like the pair of BOSE earphones, these Monster in ear speakers started breaking down as well. In the 6 months of owning and enjoying this product, I have exchanged TWO PAIRS of these darn ear buds!It came to the point where I am privy to carry a backup pair of BOSE just in case these Monster's break again and I have to ship it back to them and wait couple of weeks to get another pair."
2,Must have aligned perfectly,"In my opinion, not worth the money. I'm getting more hiss and less bass then with the el cheapo set I replaced, Also, you have to go through a series of odd twists and contortions to get them lined up pefectly in the ear, otherwise you get about half of the sound. This is a real pain if you re trying to use them sompleace where you might have to remove them regularly, suc as at the office."
2,Caveat Emptor,"Bought these terrific, comfortable in-ear phones--- which worked perfectly until one earbud died. After hours trying to figure out how to contact them online or by phone, I called and was told they couldn't do anything without the original receipt. Why is that? Isn't the product instantly identifiable as their own? No such BS on the same issue with Apple, they issued a replacement on the spot. Now I have an expensive, single earphone, and Monster just lost a customer."
3,"Good, but . . . .","Very nice sound and fidelity from these Turbine in-ear speakers.But there is a huge downside: Unlike Timex watches, they can't take a licking and keep on ticking.I'm a distance runner who likes his tunes. But with these Turbines, sweat seems to be drawn to the speakers -- which then quickly flake out (my left speaker's almost dead; my right is ""scratchy""). After only a month or two, I've been forced back to my lower quality, but much tougher, SkullCandies.So, these are great out of the box -- but their greatness seems to be tied to YOUR inactivity. So, if you just want to laze and listen, these are terrif. But if, like me, you want to be active when you use them, I'd go elsewhere. There're just too expensive for such limited use.Oh, and for active users, the ear-plugs also pop out much too easily."
4,Best pair I've owned in a while,"These are comparable to the bose earbuds in that the bass is incredibly deep, but these compensate where the Bose ones fell short. In addition to the deep bass, they're incredibly clear. They lack a bit in trebble articulation, though."
3,"Loved ""loved"" them","These were awesome until they just stopped working. I used them daily at the gym. Kinda heavy for gym use. I wouldn't use them for running or jumping rope, but just lifting or even elliptical they were great. Sound was like nothing I've ever heard. Awesome. LOVED them!!! Then all of a sudden they stopped working. They were probably six months old and I had to toss them. Way too much money to spend on something that's only gonna last 6 months. I took good care of them too. If you don't care or do want to risk it.. Check them out. I listen to metal and rap and movie soundtracks (brave heart...) stuff. It all sounded great. I miss them."
2,"Broke after VERY little, light use","Well, I think the title says it all! These stopped working after very little, light usage. I dont use them much as I have a cheaper pair for most of the time(mowing lawn, etc). They sounded good when they worked but broke way too quickly for an adult owned, gently used item. I would recommend trying another brand and stay away from MONSTER. Hope this helps"
4,"Great headphones, but where's the bass?","The product description for these, as well as some of the reviews I read, spoke of the booming bass packed into these little guys. The reality is quite the opposite. Mids, highs, vocals -- these all come out crystal clear with precise definition ... while the bass sleeps somewhere in the background. I like these headphones, and they have great isolation, but if you're looking for bass, look elsewhere."
1,Didn't last long,"If it was working i would have given it around 3 stars, but it broke down 2 months into the purchase. What a piece of #$@%..."
4,GOOD ...BUT,"like the headphones, neither case provided works very well, the headphones are difficult to get in but do fit, it may just take you a couple of tries to figure out how best works for you.they are a little heavy. the metal design is nice but a little weighty. haven't worn them for a long period yet but it doesn't bother meDO NOT BE FOOLED there is no in line pause button (the picture shows there is a play pause button on the headphones this is not true)everything else is good!"
3,Good But Not Great,"Update: Go ahead and buy these if they are only $60! I paid $100Ok...I like great sounding audio and while these headphones are a big step up from the standard Ipod headphones these don't meet my expectations for great sounding headphones. Don't get me wrong, I will be wearing these from now on but for close to $100 for headphones I was expecting a bit more. I don't get the spacial feeling that I read in all the previews and product information. I also think the bass is good but not great. They fit in my ears great though so I am happy about that."
1,Overpriced piece of garbage DO NOT BUY,What a piece of crap. Very disappointed.I am going to return these. They sound like the speakers are blown. I didn't even have them real loud so I don't understand.Quality wise these outrageously priced headphones are no better than 30 or 40 dollar ones. I have skull candy bass headphones that I got for 39.99 that sound better than these.Got these for only [...] total. Not even worth 30 bucks.
3,Great for about a year.,"I travel on the train everyday for at least 1 1/2 each way. I purchased these earbuds based on the reviews that I read about the quality and in this department they certainly deliver. However, the earbud inserts that were supplied were not comfortable enough for me to insert properly into my ears. I had to resort to purchasing the foam eartip replacements in order to get a solid and comfortable seal in my ears (which took some getting used to). Just today, as I was on my way home from a 12 hour day on the train, the right earbud cuts off. Somehow there was a connection loose in the earbud wires. I spent $163 for a pair of earbuds that lasted barely over a year."
2,Monster Turbine High-Performance In-Ear Speakers,"The sound quality was good with these earbuds, until they broke! These earbuds are very cheap quality and broke the second time I put them in my ear. The dark0 gray, back casing just separated from the part where you put your ear in, and guess what??? There was just a small amount of glue holding it together. I expected more from Monster, which is usually a brand that makes a good name for itself, but this time, they let me down. Also, these are the old models and do not come with the thing to hold your two wires together when you are listening to music. I would not recommend this to anyone unless they want a good sound paired with very cheap quality."
1,Not Worth The Money,"Pros: Amazing clarity: Highs, Mids, LowsCons: These particular ""In-Ear Speakers"" are more like ""In-Ear -> I can't barely hear"" I have to manually increase the output level of every single song to 75% in my iTunes library and have the volume turned all the way up to hear the music at a loud enough level.If you like loud music and please do not consider these ""In-Ear Speakers"". The ear buds that came with my iPod are louder and more audible than these. I even had a pair of Bose that were at least 100x times louder than these and sounded great. I don't know how this product has good ratings from anyone. I was excited for these because of all the positive reviews. I'm probably just going to throw these in the trash, because they are that bad. Waste of money!"
2,Overprced,"I usually don't waste my time filling out product reviews, but since I fell for the hype and advertising I thought that I'd post this to forewarn others who might be as gullible as I was. I'm a professional musician and college music faculty member who has good training with what acoustic music is supposed to sound like. If a musician gives a bad performance in recital, audience members might say (instead of complimenting the music) ""what a nice dress you have on tonight!"" That being said, these earphones LOOK Terrific.I bought a $5 pair with a mic to use with my i-phone that sound as well. Save your money."
1,No specs,"As with all other pricy Monster Cable products, there are no published specifications (efficiency, bandwidth, etc.)"
4,Great noise cancellation,"Very solid quality construction. The metal casing makes them feel very substantial. The only downside being that the extra weight makes them slightly more prone to loosen/fall out if you're moving at all. The snug comfortable fit is nothing short of amazing at blocking out noise, which is especially nice because it allows you to listen at much softer volumes. All in all it's a great set of ear buds, and absolutely fantastic if you're in a noisy environment, or not moving a whole lot. This would be an ideal pair for airplane rides."
2,Okay Headphones,"These headphones sounds pretty good but I've encountered some problems. First they are quite heavy so they fall out kind of easy. Secondly the right earbud cord is shorter than the left so you can constantly feel a tugging on that cord compared to the left. Combining this with the heavy weight and the right earbud falls out very easily. Also the left earbud is bassier that the right which is really annoying when listening to techno, dubstep, or other genres with heavy or a lot of bass."
4,Good treble. Ok Bass,"First of all, I'm a metal lover. I listen to music with extreme intensiveness, high distortion and lightning fast. And this review is heavily based on my own experience.First you'll be very disappointed this earphone produces relatively poor bass. You won't be satisfied if you listen to metal genres that go heavy on bass like Power, Black, etc.But if you are acoustic type, such as piano or classic guitar, this earpiece would be great. You can really feel the vibration of the sound.So it would be up to your music preference. I do not advise this for metal folks, you should stick to something that has sound isolation, not this one. But overall it produces nice sound quality for most of folks. If you still listen to Backstreet Boys sometimes like me, you'll may love it."
4,Decent,"I purchased these for something like 58 dollars during a Amazon Gold Box Deal.So far I am happy with them.At first I hated them and was ready to return, but after a day or so of getting used to them. I enjoy them.Try all the heads!!!I normally use the medium default size with ear buds. But this was not the case with these.The small tree shaped ones were perfect.Sound all depends on how they are fit in your ear.If its just a little loose. or a little the wrong way. They sound horrid.But there is this sweet spot that is amazing once you find it"
3,Great for awhile....,"They have great sound and quality. I really wasn't that impressed though. I did love them at first, but they broke after 4 months of use. I would not recommend these because, for the cost they are really no better than the $5-$15 dollar headphones you can pick up anywhere. If i was looking for higher end, great quality headphones. I would go with something that has no relation to Monster Cable."
4,"Best Sound, Bad Quality Parts","Initially, these are amazing. I got them brand-spanking been new, right out of the box. To me, the sound quality and richness of bass (and every other level for that) is the best the in-ear speaker industry has to offer. But after a month of simple everyday use, it seems to be falling apart, despite the fact I use the carrying case that came with it for transporting it. It seems something new has come loose or off almost every time I inspect them. The biggest part that PISSES ME OFF, is the problem that I've only experienced with low grade headphones (like Skullcandy Ink'd) where the wire that connects to the contact only works at certain, microspecific, angles after minimal wear-and-tear. Only buy these if you're prepared to protect them with your life."
2,Great for a year,Ive had these for a little over a yr. they worked great up until a few days ago. All the sudden I noticed the bud seemed to be a little loose. The next time I wore them they just fell apart. I cant figure out what happened. For the money these things should last a lot longer than 2 yrs.
4,I like it,"Been over a year now. I am pretty satisfied with the headphones. When I got them the box was really nice. The headphones look really nice too. The sound quality is good especially the bass compared to my stock apple headphones and other Sony ones. But my sennheiser 555s and 595s sound better. I guess the build quality could have been a little better because after 8 - 9 months of use the right side of the earbud starting losing sound because of the cable. But I treat the headphones really poorly as i go to the gym, beach, do everything with them and not put in pouch. So this might not happen to you. Called customer service had a 15 min wait but when i reached them they shipped me a brand new one. Def recommend them for the price that i got them for. 80 dollars."
3,Great... If you don't like bass!,"These earphones are of excellent quality. Highs and midrange sound great, but unfortunately, the bass is too weak. My inexpensive ($50.00) V-Moda have a lot more punch without giving up pretty decent clarity. I'm a little disappointed."
3,"Awesome sound, but with a flaw...","First off, these in-ear speakers are sturdy and have amazing sound quality, but amazing sound quality does you no good if you're constantly pushing these earbuds back in your ear. My 3-star rating was due to the fact that these little earbuds are pretty darn heavy compared to other earbuds, and as a result, they fall out of your ear. When I walk to class, I have to push them back into my ear about every minute or so because they will begin sliding out. Yes, I am using an ear tip size that fits my ear perfectly, but the portion that goes into your ear is not balanced enough to counter the weight of the rest of the earbud. If you don't plan to walk around with these earbuds, then go ahead and make the purchase because they sound awesome, but otherwise, you might want to continue shopping."
1,Sounds great - while they last,The first set lasted 3 weeks so customer service sent out a new pair. 2 months later (used in an office environment) and the left ear just went out. I used a pair of Bose for several years before replacing them with these so I don't think I'm the cause for the failures. They sound great when working but my experience with these leaves me looking for something else.
1,Not worth it!,Do not get me wrong these are good in-earphones and bass is really amazing. However there are several caveats.(1)Around the ear pieces are very flimsy and can easily snap off;(2)You have to achieve a good-fit or seal with the provided plugs to hear the truly remarkable bass reproduction. Once you achieve the seal these earphones are extremely uncomfortable in your ear canal. They are not quite conducive to extended listening. I often listen to radio while in bed and these earphones were remarkably uncomfortable for extended use.(3) I also used them once in the plane and it turned out to be a very bad idea. These snug fits in your ear canal are not quiet good for changes in air pressure.(4) Each time I use these ear phones it is a struggle to get the right fit.I would recommend IE2 Bose headphones any day! Agreed the base reproduction for Bose is not quite as good. But what is the use if can't use these phones.
3,Not worth the money,"I just bought these because the reviews say ""bass"" ""bass"" ""bass"" and great sound. For about a year I have been wearing the SkullCandy Titan's and they are amazing- great bass and sound....and they sound much better than these Monster Turbines for 1/3 the price. Trust me, save your money and get the SkullCandy Titan. It's possible that these Turbines fit better than the Titans but thats about all they win at. These headphones are not worth more than 70.00. The reason they cost more is because the case it comes in looks like about 10.00 worth. These people need to quit making amazing cases and just sell the headphones! I am just a person who loves good music and works at a production factory."
2,Not worth your money....,"These were really great earbuds when I first got them but in less than two weeks the right ear went out in sound. I did get new ones from the company but the ones that they sent did the same thing except it was the left one this time. The sound is great yes, but it's not worth buying. They break super fast and trying to get a new par took two months to get. I'm going back to my old earbuds. They may be ten dollars but at least they don't break as fast. This was a waste of money."
3,SO SO Cans,Not as good as some of the hype says they are. Must have them sit in the sweet spot in your ear for good sound. Once they are in the spot they are decent but a bit over priced.
4,Overall Good Speakers,"Here's some actual specs since none were listed:Type In-CanalSealing SealedNoise-canceling PassiveSensitivity 97 dB SPL per 1 mWImpedance 18 ohmsMaximum Output 110 dB SPLWeight 0.6 ozThese ear-buds excel in one area where most fail and that is very deep, rich bass. Whether that justifies the total cost will vary from person to person I think. Personally a good bass to me defines the difference between ok and great."
5,Monster Turbine High - In ear speaker,"These Monster Turbine High Performance in ear speakers are truly remarkable the detail to every note and excellent bass response is unequaled. The only thing I've heard that comes close to these ear buds are electrostatic head phone - bought a used pair on ebay and they were not cheap! I think they lasted about 2 months. My hat is off to Mr. Monster, Thank you. Buy a pair today if the music you like to listen to means anything!!!!!!!!"
4,Better than expected,The Turbines exceeded my expectations. They provided crystal clear highs. Clean mids and amazing (For buds) low end. The lows were clean and defined. I am shocked that these were less than $80. Worth every penny. Save your money on the Beats. Buy these instead. Keep the money for more music. These buds are excellent and the price point is lower than they should be. The packaging was amazing as well. Apple could even learn something from Monster as it relates to packaging. Nice job Monster!
2,Too heavy and underpowered in comparison to others...,"I purchased these a few months ago thinking they would be a sound improvement over my Klipsch pair (see other reviews), but found they are way too heavy (physically)in the ear and do not have sound quality as good as the Klipsch. Shipped them back to Amazon after a few days."
2,Pretty good sound but flimsy construction,"Ironically, considering that Monster made its name with ultra-thick audio cables, the big problem with these earbuds is the cheap construction of the cable & connector. These have VERY thin conductor wiring -- so much so that my model, at least, had a bad connection in the molded plug area. I have the turbine pro model, too, and I'm happy with them (admittedly, the cable there is also thinner than, say my shure E4Cs). I'd bought these for my daughter. The sound quality is not bad, though not great. We could have lived with that, if not for the construction problems. Going back."
1,Monster Pulls A Fast One On Their Customers! BEWARE!!,"I just picked up a pair of these over the weekend. I want to let everyone know that monster is still packaging the OLD headphones in NEW boxes. APPARENTLY a new version is coming out and they are still trying to sneak out the back stock on the bad ones. I just spend a day on the phone with monster, first they didnt believe me.... then i had to send in pictures... then they thought their own headphones were counterfeit. Now they want me to send in these headphones so they can replace them, and didn't even tell me the ones on the box even exist!Why would you pull a fast one on 150$ headphones when you have all the profits from Dre Beats to help cover extra costs.these sound great, but i want the new headphones not the old model....They even removed the product temp from their site!!!"
2,"Good sound, bad construction","The bass in these things is incredible. Just absolutely amazing, sometimes even too much though. But the bad part about these earbuds is the construction. Half of the left earbud fell off the first hour i got it. That was an easy fix, just a bit of superglue needed to put them back together. But a month later the left earbud has a spotty connection to the jack and i have to fiddle with the part of the cord just go make the sound go to both ears. That was not solvable and the left earbud eventually became unusable. The website listed in the packed that came with the earbuds for customer service no longer exists. soo..... basically, if you are not going to be doing much traveling with these earbuds, then they are good for you. If you are even going to be wearing them outside while walking around, dont buy them cause they will break on you."
2,"Two pairs, both fell apart, two returns","Ordered one pair, screen on the eartip arrived dislodged. Not a real fix for the home consumer, plus if you're paying this price, you shouldn't have to fix them out of the box. Returned. Second pair received and the casing on the earpiece separated, exposing the wiring to the actual speaker. Again, this is unusable in this state, and I shouldn't have to superglue a high-end product.There is a reason Amazon suspended sales of this product for a period of time. They probably received a ton of returns.Comfort - fairly heavy for earbuds, but otherwise average comfort. Sound - strong bass and no distortion at high volumes, provided you get the fit right. Nothing that would blow your mind unless you've only been using the headphones that came with your device.A decent option at $70 and under (if they don't break on you); definitely not worth $149."
1,Where's The Beef,"This is the first time I've bought a pair of upgraded earphones. I was excited to try them but when I put them on they sounded tinney. No midtone and no bass. The earphones themself were pretty heavy compared to the free ones that come with most things. I tried them with my ipod, iphone and a beefed up audio on my PC. I had my wife try them as well. Nada. I sent them back. I don't understand how they could make it past quality control. Amazon, as usual, refunded right away."
2,Ipod-Iphone Alternative Headphones,"This is the second pair of the headphones that I've tried. Initially, the first pair only provided high-fidelity with almost no bass-so I returned them. The second pair were only slightly better. What I discovered was that you must place the buds fully in your ear which I'm very uncomfortable with. This is the only way to experience the ""Deep Bass"" that the manufacturer claims. I am very disappointed with my purchase---I just summed it up to great advertising..bad result for me."
2,Sound is decent but read the review,"The only reason why these earbuds earned two stars is because they sound decent. But the problem with most in-ear buds headphones is that when you wear them while you are exercising or doing a strenuous activity (Like running), it is not uncommon for them to fall out of your ear, so in return you may push them in deeper and deeper each and every time they fall out of your ear and eventually you will encounter one huge PROBLEM! The silicone tip of the earbud may become disconnected from the earbud and is in return deeply stuck inside your ear canal!! Just be careful if you are considering in-ear buds because of this problem. If you don't believe this happens, you can google it and see what other similar problems like this has happened to other people."
1,They smell terrible!,"These Monster earphones smell terrible! Like toxic industrial waste. I hoped airing them out for a few weeks would help, but no. They sound great, but the smell is intolerable. Possibly unhealthful for human contact.An increasing number of products made in China smell terrible. They emit a horrible chemical smell. This is possibly a significant health problem for us, but how can we know for sure? China is one of the world's largest purchasers of recyclable material. Is there a connection?"
2,Seriously overpackaged and overpriced,I can't remember buying anything as nicely packaged as these ear speakers which must be why they cost so much.I plugged them into my NAD receiver with ZZ Top playing and kept rearranging the ear pieces trying to get them to sound better. So I swapped out eartips and put on Etta James and it sounded like I was listening to her on and old AM radio.I'm giving them two stars rather than one because they have a nice traveling case and I liked the assortment on eartips. I'm giving them to my grandson.
1,not worth the money....,"i bought these on sale for $75 and they're still not worth that much , they sound like a pair of $25 headphones.."
5,Great Value,"I was pleasantly surprised when these came, the packaging made me feel as though I was opening a very expensive piece of electronics. The sound is superb and the build quality is excellent. So far I have been very impressed and I expect them to last for a long time."
2,Broken Twice,"I got this as a gift from my uncle a year ago. After 3 months the right side broke. I sent it in for warranty and they shipped me new ones about 3 months later. I received them not too long ago and the headphones are broken yet again. Def not worth the headache even as a gift. I think the sound signature is also very poor. I appreciate bass and I can say that headphones with little bass bother me a bit but these headphones are nothing but rattling in your ear. Heavy on bass and everything else is kind of muffled in comparison with other headphones. Other headphones Ive had ranged from 20 dollar headphones to 160 dollar headphones. If I could recommend a headphone, I would go with the Klipsh s4, their a better build and are more durable. Ive had those for a year now and no problems what so ever."
5,Great sound from this in ear headphones.,"I would never have thought that in ear headphones from Monster would sound so good. I never buy things from Monster, because of their overprice items. But I got this for less than 100 bucks. They sound as good as the Klipsch s4 or better I would say. I totally recommend these in ear headphones. They look nice as well and feel great. And they smell good, LOL"
5,WOW!!!!!,"I have had numerous headphones which i use to go running with. These are by far the best set, sound quality and fit wise, i have EVER had. I would recommend these to anyone who wants to listen to good sounds with a comfortable fit. Plus they come with plenty of extra ear pieces in case the default buds dont fit your ears. 10000% satisfaction!!!!"
4,turbine earphones rock!!!,"These are the best earphones I've ever purchased. Sound is great, bass is excellent, and comfort is awesome. I recommend these in-ears to any music enthusiast!"
4,There Great!,The headphones are great sounding and feel and look very durable. The only one problem I have with them is the tip size eventhough the small size fits me...it tends to fall out (rarely). But overall these are great headphones quality and sounding vise. I would definitely recommend people to cop a pair of these!!
1,They fell apart after a month's use!,"I've only had these for about 3 months, and really started using them a month ago. While trying to find the best ear pieces to use, the right ear bud completely fell apart into 2 pieces. This is something I'd expect for $5 headphones, certainly not these. Sound quality was just OK, and they hurt after about an hour of use. I really don't think this is worth the price I paid for them."
2,Eek,"the ear buds dont have good bass, I know they are earbuds but the range on these are limited. Okay"
3,decent ear phones,"bought these when they were $58 so i really cant complain too much. here goes: the lows are there, loud and boomy but a bit muddled. the mids are a bit understated and the highs are a bit smeared. requiring one to start messing with the EQ, which is not a good idea if you have a good source. but still, far superior to any ear buds that come with any mp3 player or cell phone. if you're a bass head listening to EDM or hip-hop, these are for you, buy them now. if you listen to jazz or classical, look else where. also they are made of metal and a bit heavy so they will make their way out and fall off if you're running or doing any kind of exercise."
2,Customer Service Needs to be desired!,"Bought this item for a Christmas gift. When item was opened, one of the ear pods did not work properly. Tried to see if it was the actual music device causing this? No chance. Went through Amazon Customer to exchange or refund this product. They only accept REFUNDS no EXCHANGES. I truly wanted to re-purchase or exchange this item. They would not let me exchange. AND here is the kicker........If I wanted to purchase them again, I could not get them for the SALE price, The Vendor would not honor the sale price...so now I would have had to pay 3 times for the actual cost of the item, which equaled an extra $174 dollars. So I returned them. They can have them. I purchased a set of Bose ear buds which worked out great."
4,WOW,"Really awesome headphones, though they don't deserve such a high price tag, bought them on a gold box deal for 60 odd dollars and its 60$ well spent. Choosing the right ear piece would make a lot of difference to the sound quality and also the blocking of the outside sound.only bad thing I found is the you can hear the sound of the cable touching you whenever you walk, not preferable for running as the headphones are quite heavy and might fall off...would recommend only if you find a good deal, but its not worth 150 dollars."
4,Monster In Ear Turbines,"They look good, but a little flimsy on the cables. Kind of hard to get a good fit but overall a good set of In Ear Speakers."
2,Stay away,"Don't just don't. Bass quality depends on how aggressive you're willing to be in pushing the monsters into your ears.My pair fell apart after two months; left side just quit and I had to take it to a repair guy who said ""well these are not very well built are they?""As far as I noticed amazon actually took them off the site for a while - probably due to too many complaints - now it's back and it's still bad for you. Or me."
3,Okay,"These are absolutely superb sounding earbuds. However the quality of them are in question. Within a week of purchasing the item, both of the red and blue tapes tore off. Then after I had these for a good 4 months The left part just bombed. A couple days after the right on did too. I am currently working on the warranty, and a bit disappointed, considering I only used these headphones moderately and gently."
1,"Good sound, but terriblequality","Good sound but TERRIBLE quality build. I have gone through 3 in under a year, they also have poor poor customer service. DO NOT BUY"
1,Bad connection,"I only used it for a little bit more than 1 month, one of the earphone doesn't get sound come out."
4,"Excellent sound, lousy fit, flimsy cord","As far as sound goes, these buds are awesome. Listening to people talk is like having them right next to me. When listening to music, the bass really comes out. The fake-leather carrying case and added accessory baglet is also nice to have while storing or transporting these buds.But the buds hurt my ears. After two hours I have to remove them to give my ears a rest. The cord is also a foot too short and too thin, so using these on anything other than a closely-held iPod or MP3 player is out of the question because the cord is thin and likely to rip apart should the user wear these while doing physical exercise. The thin cord also easily gets tangled in itself.So...if you are a cautious user, don't wear buds while working or doing physical exercise, these buds are awesome for their audio performance. But are they worth the current price of almost USD 100?"
2,Unfortunately frustrated,"I really wanted to give these headphones a higher review, though i cannot. I must admit the sound quality is superb and unmatched by any previous models of in-ear headphones i have owned, BUT the build quality does not match that of the sound. After about a month of owning these the housing on the right headphone came apart but i snapped it back together and didn't have any problems until recently. After about 6 months of regular use the left housing completely came apart and recently one of the wires detached itself from the speaker (if that's what you would call it) rendering it useless . I'm going to try and sauter the wire back to the speaker so i'll update my rating based on the outcome."
2,Don't Know What Your Listening Too!,"I believe I was being generous with 3 stars. These things sound like you are listening to music from a pair of tin cans. My $99 pair of Sony's have twice the base with less distortion. I was listening via IPOD which of course music isn't great but with these, wow! 45's sounded better out of an old audiovox player/speaker combo.Well constructed if that counts so if you keep them past a return you can listen to them forever."
1,Nothing Special,"I purchased these based on the amount of positive reviews I had read here at Aamazon. My ear buds came defective. The left ear piece was extremely loose and the speaker was barely audible out of that side as well. Sometimes it would make a crackling noise and begin to work. There was not anything really impressive about the sound quality. Several items such as the extra rubber ear buds, the right angle connector and cable clip were all missing from my box. I suspect i received re-packaged merchandise."
1,Worst in ear headphones i tried.,"I ordered these from Amazon last week and returned them right away, the sound was nowhere near as good as Shure In Ear Headphones, there was also static noise.On top of all this, the left headphone blew out just after TWO days of use, i listen to music with a volume a little above average (65/100).Please take my advice and do not buy these, there are MUCH better Headphones out there, such as Shure."
1,Bait and Switch,I purchased these on a gold box special. What I received was something less than what I anticipated. It was suppose to have an angle adapter and I received a straight one.
1,No better than standard iPod earbuds,"So I tried these out the other day and compared them to the standard iPod earbuds, and I couldn't tell the difference. You would think it would offer deeper base or louder sounds, something, but for the life of me I can't tell the difference. I guess at the end of the day they are earbuds, and it's probably hard to make huge leaps in audio quality with them. A decent pair of $20 or $30.00 earbuds will produce the same sound."
1,Garbage,"Sounds worse then the $20 JVC Marshmallows I currently use.Received as a gift, will be selling on Craigslist for $30, and whoever buys them will be dissapointed even at that price.Plus, Monster is an evil company that preys on small businesses and gullible consumers."
1,avoid these like the plague,"these would be great if they came in a cracker jack box.... alas their sound quality for ear buds is about on par with that of the stock apple iPod buds. sure, they isolate outside noise better, but that's about it. if you're looking for the best bang for the buck and you have to have buds instead of over-the-ears, save yourself some money and frustration and go for the jlab j2's which amazon usually sells for $25-$30 at any given time. the j2's have a rich frequency response curve with no discernible distortion even at high volumes. you'll much appreciate those and loathe the monsters."
4,Monster deal.,"Well like most people whom seem to be reviewing this product, I got these earphones from the golden box deal thing. I had my eye set on the Bose IE2's but for $58, I figured the Monster Turbines were by far the better deal. I live in NYC so the noise cancelling factor is a must for me. These earphones are great for the price I got them but not for $149.99! Yes, they sound great and have wonderful bass(for you hip hop fans)however, they are overpriced. If your the casual user like me just save the yourself $150."
3,Great but they hurt,These sound great. the only problem I had was when I wear them the big housing touches the edge of my ear. After a period of time it starts to hurt. I'm not sure if anyone else has this problem but I do. Not good.
4,Ideal headphones for traveling or just listening,"Since I travel a great deal and Im also looking for ideal head phone set, this Monster product ear phones have worked out well for me. It does isolates the sound from the outside (similar to the air flight traveling noise reducer ear phone set), which enables me to listen very clearly to the sound, without distraction. Great for editing film on computer. The service from the seller was very fast. Great service overall."
5,Sound is amazing,"The sound on these things is absolutely incredible. I have been on a quest to find theperfect earphones for about a decade now. I have purchased (and returned...:)) Shure se530,Klipsch (various models), Monster beats, Shure se110, se210, bose in-ear buds, Sonys, Vibe moda extra bass and onand on. The Shure se530's sounded good but I felt guilty for spending $500 on them so I tookthem back. I was convinced that I could find something that sounded good for less money.Well, the Monster turbines sound every bit as good as the Shure se530's. It has a great balance of great basswhile still retaining the detailed highs and mids. Every song I hear on them I feel like I'm hearing it for thefirst time. I hate the rubber eartips (on all brands). I loved the foam tips on the shures. So I boughtsome Comply foam tips and it works out great. I can get my comfort and still have the great sound qualityand low price of the turbines."
1,These headphones are horrible,After 1 month of use the right ear went out. After that 2 weeks go by and the left goes out. They are not worth the price whatever you do dont buy these headphones they will break on you I promise.
1,"Intolerably pathetic mids, bass no better than Shure SE315 or Etymotic ER-4P","The mids are missing, making rock/R&B;/classical/all songs sound hollow. The original iPod/iPhone headphones give better sound quality.If you seek in-ear phones to block out cell phone yappers on your commute or colleagues at work, you will spend several times more money than a cheap pair of headphones. Even on these Monster Turbines. Spend a bit more and get a decent earphone. Try the Shure SE315s (if they don't fit well, the predecessors SE310 or E3C have the same quality but better ergonomics). Try Etymotic ER-4Ps. (I think those are the best phones out there... and the only earphone whose price has increased over time.)Mine also arrived with gunk on the outside of one of earphones. Amazon accepted the return."
2,Fell apart after two months of very gentle use,"Bought these last year at Christmas time in a Gold box special for $70.00. Less than two months later one of the ear buds separated, rendering it useless. That's a lot of money to throw away. As to the sound it was OK, but not great. The bass on my Sennheiser CX-300 II Precision Enhanced Bass Earbuds is superior and they have held together very well. I would not recommend these and seeing another Monster Gold Box special today with poor customer reviews reminded me to speak out about the inferior workmanship of this product."
1,Recommendations,"unless you want to waste $100 DO NOT PURCHASE THESE HEADPHONES!!!! Mine went out abruptly, I have no recourse except to return to my ipod earbuds. I should have stayed with them from the beginning."
4,One Of the Best Headphone I've ever HAd,I like emthey arrive very soonthey sound good but i spent some time trying that my body accpt em and feel comfy with themreal nice sound i heard things i never hear with my ipod's headphonesit could be a nice purchase for everyone
2,"Not for sports, but great sound!","If you are not going to use these for anything athletic then they are a great deal! BUT I workout, run, and snowboard and these headphones haven't lasted more than a weekend. So the overall construction of the buds is not up to par, but if your a casual listener these do have really great sound! I ended up returning these twice and am unfortunately trying something more active!Ended up using a replacement pair for about a year and the left speaker just gave out on it. They did sound great and I wanted to like them, but when I bought them they were a deal of the day at 120$ i believe. Anyway look elsewhere. I would like to return them now, but does anyone know about the warranty? I didn't see it in the product details."
2,Broke after 20 days,After about 10 days the left earbud started to have problems. A few days later it stopped working all together.
2,Good while they worked,"I had these headphones, after about a year they developed a short in the right ear and now are quite useless. My crappy stock ipod headphones have lasted me longer :-("
2,"Good sound quality, very poor construction","I purchased a pair of these earbuds this past December. I was very pleased with the sound quality- clear, deep bass and good overall balance. I was using them at my computer and walking to work. Last week, I was taking them out of my ears in a very standard fashion, and the right earbud broke into two pieces, leaving the wire hanging out. Naturally, I was surprised. With a price tag like this and a brand name like Monster, I expected more.I contacted Monster's customer support via email 5 days ago outlining the problem, and have yet to receive a response. Needless to say I am hesitant to recommend this product to others."
1,Perhaps defective - NO BASS!,"Given the other glowing reviews, perhaps my product was defective. These are terrible sounding headphones (equivalent sound found in the $10 range). The treble was tinny and the bass totally absent. I read about ""breaking in"" high quality headphones by playing full range music at full volume for several hours - I tried and no improvement. I tried all the ear pieces thinking perhaps placement in the ear was the issue - no improvement. I returned the headphones - Amazon is great! One solid plus is the tangle free cord - it truly does minimize tangles. On another down side, the weight of the ear buds make it hard for them to stay in your ears while running (even with the correct sized ear piece)."
3,"Good headphones, but not worth the money","These headphones sound good and look even better. The metal gives them a great look and feel!The sound is clear and crisp and the bass is pretty solid as long as you put them in your ears the way they suggest.I returned these however because they didn't sound any better than theSennheiser CX200sI bought not long before getting these. They look and feel much better (in your hand, the Sennheisers are just as comfortable), but I wasn't willing to shell out for the aesthetics alone.If you're looking for great bass, go with Sony's - they're cheaper and bass-ier. I recommend the Sennheisers for good all around sound at a good price. For high end, maybe check out some Shures."
1,"Monster Turbines: Bad choice for Iphone, IPod, IPad","If you are planning to use these with your Iphone, Ipod or Ipad you will be very disappointing as I am now. Monster should put a warning in their product labels, sounds is terrible!!! Waste of money. Please don't buy this product if you are going to use it in your apple products."
3,"Like most Moster products you pay for the name ""Monster""","I don't know if the name monster is for the product or the price! Monster makes great items i guess, but their prices are monster as well. Thses are no differnt. Sound quality is good, feel great in the ears and look good. So if you wanrt a pair of head phones that are quality and you have extra cash that you want to waste theses are for you. By the way this is the first item i have ever reveiwed."
5,"the ""BEST"" ever!!!!","my order arrived 03.25.09,... 15 minutes later i ordered a second pair for my son! that's it in a nut-shell. they will need a ""break-in"" period as decribed by others, but if you know speaker/sound driver characteristics that's a given. i'm 53years old and an audiophile since age ten. as a teen i was investing in high-end stereo equipment while my peers were buying ""boom-boxes"". that said, these are the best sounding head-sets i've ever heard granted you get your tone setting dialed in,...ENJOY!!!!!ps: if you're considering the ""z-buds"" beware those are a great concept, but poor execution. i purchased two pair and both had intermittent shorting. one set had a faulty volume module, the other a faulty mic/ switch. the sound was okay at first but..."
5,Great Sound For Less!,"These are the best earbuds I have ever had! They produce very nice lows with no buzzing. I personally like the weight to them, and the choices of earpieces are great. The carrying case it comes with is the nicest I have seen with headphones. If you are like me, and looking for great headphones at a relatively good price, buy these!"
2,It was refurbed,Left speaker ear bud was defetive the sound was lower than the left and you could hear the sound that a busted speaker makes at time other than that the sound that was not effected sounded great
2,piece of sh.t,"these headphones are just not worth the price... Im using Cowon S9 as a sound source (best sound around for the money) I used the sennheiser CX400 headphones that i bought for 40 bucks from amazon and i was happy with them until they broke a year later.I thought i will upgrade the quality and these headphones were on sale in gold box deal so i took it, but they are not what you expect from something that expensive :!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Right side is wobbly and almost opens,the cheap color just wears down- minor problem,if u use them for more than few minutes it hurtsand THE WORST PART IS THE CABLE that BROKE after MONTH!! of light usageThe only +:The sound clarity is pretty goodBTW: those senns. were trough hell unlike these"
2,"Great sound, if you can keep them in your ears...","I got these for $58, so I guess I can't complain much but I thought I'd steer people away from these if I could. They sound great for the price, but dear God it's almost IMPOSSIBLE to keep them in your ears. I've tried every rubber tip included and they're constantly falling out of my ears at the slightest head movement. Incredibly frustrating! It got to the point where I was so distracted at work from having to jam them back in my ears every 30 seconds that I just stopped using them. Turn your head slightly? They fall out. Yawn or talk? They fall out. Put the left one back in your ear? The right one falls out. They're just far too heavy for the design and the rubber tips don't have any grip to them.So in short: They sound great, but in my particular case, they're absolutely useless."
1,NICE WHILE THEY LASTED,"I bought these when they were on sale for 50%. Really liked them, but with daily use, they don't last. Too bad and not worth replacing for over $100."
1,Monster Turbines,"I am totally gob smacked. I have read so much about these things and how brilliant they are. i was totally underwhelmed with what sounds like $20 earbuds. Are the ones i bought off Amazon fake or is this just hyperbole from Monster. On the same day i purchased some Sennheiser CX 500's for $30 off Ebay which probably should have been fake at that price but turned out to be light years ahead of the Monsters. Bass is muddy. midrange, confused, and highs either not there or lacking any transient separation.....they're terrible!!!. How can i tell if they're a fake??... I wouldn't have a clue but if they are Monster need to do something quick as this only leads to uncertainty from the buyer...C'mon Amazon...what's the go here??"
2,Great...for about 2 months,"Bought these for my girlfriend. I, myself, prefer Klipsch but she gets what she wants. Great packaging and (deceptively) they appear to be very solid. The sound is almost comparable with the Klipsch S2 (more bass, but less crisp mids and highs) but not near the X10. My GF however, was happy with the style and performance .... for the approximately TWO MONTHS she used them before the left bud simply went out. When Monster claims that these earbuds are ""built to last"".... they left out the remainder of the sentence... ""built to last -- two months""."
2,Nice while they lasted but they didn't last too long,"I used these primarily at work, just sitting at my desk listening to podcasts and music while programming. Light use, non-sport. And they broke 2 times.The first time, the left earbud split in two where it's assembled. I used some JBWeld to seal it back together and all was well.However recently, the earbuds have all but died, giving muted music.While they worked they sounded great and came at a fair price point of around $100 when I bought them through Amazon. 2 stars for that. Minus 3 stars for average quality and poor durability. $100 earbuds should not break after 3 years with light use."
4,Great product,"Product works great, can really feel the bass in your ear.Noticeable sound output compared to the cheap earphones.Great range of earpieces to select from."
2,Good product but terrible customer service,"Good quality, great sound. After using this product for about a year the right ear-phone started cutting in and out, after I sent the product back I received a replacement 3 months later that was also defective. Very disappointing. I have now sent about ten emails to there customer service in the last month and have not yet received a single response. I have tried to call a couple times but received no answer after waiting for about 20 minutes. Despite the great quality of this product I will never purchase from Monster Cable ever again. It is not worth all this hassle. There are similar products by companies who offer much better service for the same price if not less."
1,"High Priced, Not Worth it.","Bought these headphones about 5 months ago. They actually sound pretty great, when they're not falling out of your ear or not isolating sound. After 2 months they went out, I sent them to monster, and got them replaced by a brand new pair. Which then lasted about 2 months, and went out again. I would expect this out of a $20 set, but 100+ dollars? Definitely not."
4,why?,"outside of an issue with the earbud separating where the two halves of the metal ends meet in the middle, and finding the correct earplugs, once I crazy glued them back together and found the right fit, the sound from these things was stellar. Handles distortion free thumping bass with ease. Anyone having issue with the sound either received the occasional mistake in a product, or may need to concentrate on rating the poor ability of their ears to hear. I've had these for quite some time now, and they're a great purchase and a quality product."
3,Life is too short for lengthy warranty replacement,"I was happy with the quality of the sound. I say I was because after about 8 months of owning these headphones, the left doesn't output any sound anymore. I was still under warranty so I sent them back to Monster for a replacement. It's been almost 2 months and I still haven't heard back from them. I called and the nice customer service lady could only say that they are in the ""fulfilment"" status but has no idea when the replacment will actually be fulfilled.Back when I still had the headphones, I used the headphones to block off conversations outside by cube when I work and I would say my Klipsch Image S4 does a better job. And maybe because the Image S4 isolates sounds better, I actually hear more of the music."
3,Monster ear bugs,"They sound ok, but I didn't let the fit, and they didn't stay in my ears while at the gym.I decided to sell them and purchased the Bose IE2, I alway's like Bose and have the over the ear noise canceling headphones...I love the sound from Bose hands down"
3,SICK - For 60 bucks - Nevermind (new edit),"These things are incredible. I picked them up through the Gold Box deal (check it often, I've seen them in there twice now) and holy crap. For the price I paid, I've never heard any earbuds like these. Love them...but doubt I would pay full price for them, because I don't use them at work. I use them at home. I can't use them at work, because they completey isolate your ear and music (which makes for a great listening experience). I'd like to see how good these are in a plane. Definitely recommend these at the Gold Box price - if you're a baller, pick them up at retail price.NEWI've had two sets of these now. Why? Because one of the damn headphones keeps going out. First it was the left side. Bought a new set and now the right side has gone out. So frustrating. I can't afford to keep replacing these things. Changed to 3 stars because the durability is not very good for sitting at a desk, apparently."
2,Could Be Better,"Let's get straight to the point.Comfort: They're not the most uncomfortable headphones ever, but can get heavy in your ear. Wouldn't use them for working out.Sound Quality: Again, not the best but not the worst. It doesn't match the price tag in this category.Durability/Style: While they look really really cool, they get a bit heavy being all metal. The microphone/song selection button feels cheap compared to the rest. Positive side, the box they come in/cases you get with them are brilliant!I received these headphones from Monster Cable as part of the Turbine Challenge at no charge. This review is my own fair, honest opinion and was not influenced or guided in any manner by Monster"
4,Short Review,OK couple of things:- I wish I could give 4.5 stars- I got these for $50 bucks here during some promotion - that was too good to pass- The are really VERY well built- Sound is greatOnly con for me is that they are a little bulky... I don't know if that makes sense.... they are a little heavy but then again super well built so you can look at it both ways.Anyway with the price I got.... these cannot be beat but I think the current price ($100 plus) is a little high.
4,good earphone,"good quality of for sound and nice vlue of the body, all in all, this is an amazing product with a low price, i am very satisfy with it."
5,my favorite,very comfortable with the rounded earbuds. the long ones make my inner ear itchy. absolutely fantastic sound. great bass for an earbud
3,1 Year Review,"Bought these headphones a year ago so I have sufficient experience with them to write a review. As a note, I treated these headphones very well, storing them in it's little case after each use.Pros:-Sound is great-Comes with lots of earbuds of varying sizes-Nice packagingCons:-part of plastic covering plug came off after a few months of use (still usable after)-Even with the multitude of earbuds, listening more than an hour felt uncomfortable and does not stay in well.-Phone voice device stopped working after a few months.-Right earbud stopped working after half a year. Had to twist and wiggle wires to get sound out of both channels.-Currently, after about 1 year both sides have issues with sound and don't produce unless I wiggle and hold the wires.-Paint is chipped around all areas that have paint even with careful use.Conclusion: For the price I expect something much more durable, comfortable and with a more straightforward return policy. Cannot recommend."
3,"Great beginning, boring end.","I usually love reading books such as this one but although the book started out as a page turner, it quickly ended up on the lower shelf of my bookcase, the last third unread, for a few months until I finally picked it up just so I could file it away! I will not start another book until I've finished the one I'm reading so I had no choice but to read the ending. Unlike the beginning 2/3's which were exciting, amazing and extremely interesting, the end of the book was surprisingly dull and boring. The court section dragged on and on and it was so predictable too. Everything I guessed would happen, did! If the whole book had been as entertaining as the first two thirds, I would have given it 5 stars and recommended it highly but the author blew it with her rushed last part and very predictable ending."
5,Barbara Stager sickens me,"This is a woman who is the ultimate sociopath. So long as she gets what she wants, she could not possibly care less who gets hurt...or murdered in the process. The manner in which she brainwashed her two sons and turned them against their paternal grandparents is indicative of the way her sick mind works.Those oh so ""god-fearing"" friends and neighbors of hers who thought she was SO ""righteous"" are as bad as she is!I just hope this vampire doesn't find a third man to marry and murder."
5,The church lady............the killer,"Yet another classic from the pen of Jerry Bledsoe. This book recounts the shocking story of Barbara Stager,a woman who was an agent of the devil, yet who appeared to be a model of Christian virtue by shrouding herself and her life with hypocrisy. She cold bloodedly murdered two sleeping husbands, not out of anger, or jealousy, or self defense, but out of the unquenchable greed that her own desperate desires had wrought in her, wickedly and calculatingly placing a price tag on the heads of both of these unfortunate men who each made one fatal mistake. An actress of Oscar winning ability, she was then able to convince many people around her of her innocence, but she couldn't convince the people who mattered the most; the police, the district attorneys, and most importantly, the jury. With this masterpiece, Bledsoe again proves that only he and Ann Rule are the true pioneers of the true crime genre. Another ten star effort. Chilling!"
4,Will Dana Carvey play her in the TV Movie?,"Jerry Bledsoe, one of the upper echelon writers in this genre (along with Gregg Olsen and Ann Rule,) has written another extensively researched and riveting saga of murder in the Tar Heel state.Poor sanctimonious ""church lady"" Barbara Terry Ford Stager. She keeps ""accidentally"" shooting her husbands. She literally got away with the murder of Husband #1, but went 1 for 2 when she killed Husband #2. As one of the jurors in her trial said: """"She'll get off in twenty years and she'll get her another one and pop him off."" Men of North Carolina: Be careful out there!"
1,Not worth the money.,"The title is interesting, but what you're buying is a very brief review (what they call the ""article"") of a book of that title. The review is very brief and not worth the money. I thought I was buying a journal article. I was very dissappointed when this abstract appeared, thinking I had purchased the article. I felt cheated. If you're interested in the topic (the title), find the book and order it."
4,Can I borrow half of a Star please?,"I bought this cd because I was drawn in by the cover. I can appreciate an artist who isn't afraid to stay simple and let the music speak for itself, without feeling the need to have a fancy shiny cover full and busy. Who cares about the cover-art?, I do, and here's why.This album is just what you'd expect from it's cover. It's simple, it's nothing super out of the ordinary, and you never want to [cue corny joke] 'LEAVE' your cd player again. Seriously though, I love it. I have yet to hear Beneath the Medecine Tree in it's entirety, but I am sure that it can't be any worse than this one, which is excellent. But it loses half a star for recording quality ( I prefer much clearer vocals, i.e. The Dears, etc.)"
2,OK,"ok album, however, after hearing Beneath the Medicine Tree, this album was a letdown. Songs are a lot more punk and feel as if they came off of a conveyor belt, if you know what I mean. I would definately recommend Beneath the Medicine tree for its emotion, harmonies, and originality comparable to Dashboard Confessional's songs. This album lacks all of those elements."
2,non standard,The hot and water shanks were a half inch shorter than standard shanks so I could not install it in my counter to replace a standard one my self requiring me to hire and pay a plumber more than faucet cost-should have been a 15 min job but not with sub standard length shanks
3,I wish I were Anastasia...,"Anastasia has to move from the apartment in Cambridge she's lived in all her life out to the dreaded suburbs! However will she adjust?I have always been incredibly jealous of Anastasia's life, ever since I was her age. Her parents treat her like a person and respect her input, her father teaches at Harvard, she lives in the Boston area, and now she has a house with a tower bedroom! (I do realize that Anastasia is fictional.)Lowry has created a very realistic narrator that young people will relate to. She surrounds her protagonist with quirky, well-drawn characters, then puts her in some very common situations. Young people will recognize the plot lines from their own lives, and be entertained by the off-the-wall characters."
5,I take this book everywhere I go!,Anastasia Again is about a young girl named Anastasia and she is having some problems. Her parents want to move to the suburbs but she says that she doesn't want to move because all the articles say bad things about the suburbs. I really like this book. I read the first few pages and I love it. Everywhere I go I take it with me. Lois Lowry is a great writer. I think that what Lois Lowry is trying to say is that things that seem bad sometimes come out being good.
2,Ho hum,"This book was basically mildly mediocre. Maybe it's because I already know something about the antitrust laws, but I didn't feel that this book actually told me anything new. I feel that perhaps in their effort to make the antitrust laws ""readable"" by a layman they have made the material useless. You could probably find just as useful an introduction to antitrust laws online someplace for free."
3,slice of life movie,"nice performances by Rosanna Arquette, Judd Nelson, & 'Crocodile Dundee' Paul Hogan. Arquette plays a alcoholic whose life has turned into chaos, and basically the movie shows the viewer the consequences of her mistakes. She learns to reclaim her life in the end and find peace with the help of her two newfound friends, who are also struggling in their life and sobriety."
1,Very disappointing,"We saw a few small clips of Robert G. Lee on a Bananas DVD, and liked him. But when we watched this show, there were a number of times we had to fast-forward because of semi-inappropriate talk. He says he is a Christian, but the performance wasn't uplifting."
2,No better than Campbell's,"I'm reviewing the Organic Chicken and Egg Noodles soup. I'm puzzled by the reviews that rave about the soup -- the only thing I can think of is that perhaps they are reviewing different kinds. This particular soup is not worth the money. You will need to get a magnifying glass to see the chicken. The egg noodles are ""okay."" You'll get lots of water and celery, so if you like that, then this is for you. The flavor is good, but not better than the various canned soups you buy at the grocery store. I'd say save your money."
3,Good but too greasy,This soup has a nice taste (not great) but the problem for me is that the soup is very greasy. That alone would keep me from re-ordering this soup.
2,Ok but tastes suspiciously like Campbell's Select,"This soup is ok, but it's certainly not what you would expect from Wolfgang Puck. It's not anything like what you might get in a restaurant. Oddly enough, it tastes suspiciously like the Campbell's select style soup that you can buy in the jar. (I don't know if that's a product that's still around, but I used to buy it often years ago.)"
4,Yummy chicken soup,"Although some cans can be a little inconsistent with the bulky contents (chicken pieces, carrots, celery) overall I really enjoy this soup. It's got a nice texture and the veggies are bright and not wilted. Perfectly seasoned, in my opinion, and doesn't have the grainy, salty taste that most canned soups have because it's free of MSG. Yum!"
3,OK tasting but not great,"I'm commenting on ""Wolfgang Puck Organic Chicken with Egg Noodles Soup"". It's a decent soup but not that great tasting. I'd say it's OK. One of the reasons it's only OK is that it could use more meat. Worthy of 3 stars. Not quite good enough for 4 stars."
3,"Ok info, bad presentation","Although the content of this book was somewhat helpful, I could hardly get past the typos. It looks as though the rough draft might have been mistakenly published. Also, several of the websites listed were not available. There is some advertising in the book here and there and some of those businesses are also not accesible via the internet. For the price of the book, I felt it to be poorly put together and would not recommend spending the money."
2,vague at best,i got the feeling the author knew more about costa rica (where he lives?) than panama. not recommended...the info just wasn't very comprehensive.
3,outdated,"This book has a lot of information to get one started. It was printed in 2006, a little outdated. The costs and prices are not in line with todays cost of living"
5,Citizen eco-drive rocks,"Got this as a present for my mum. Great watch. Good bling value and keeps accurate time. Strap is easy to adjust and best of all, it never needs batteries or winding. Highly recommend."
2,"Love the reader, but that's not what I bought!","Just chiming in with the rest. I can use the card reader they sent me, but it's not what is advertised on this page. I NEED the ADAPTER to read my CF cards with the READER that I received.Get on the ball Amazon! This is the first trouble I've ever had with Amazon, so I'll give 2 stars, but correct this problem please."
3,Pricey,"I was thinking about purchasing this because the new laptop I'm ordering from Amazon has an Express34 slot instead of the PCMCIA slot my old laptop has. Then I read the reviews and noticed the price. One might consider the Sandisk Extreme USB 2.0 Reader as an alternative. It is half the price and uses the USB port on your laptop instead. Same 20MB performance. Only 'drawback' is you have to carry the unit and a usb cable compared to just this card, though the unit is very compact. Amazon sells it."
1,"Poorly constructed - beware, delicate","I bought this and generally found that it was very quick, compact which in my bag is important. It was ideal for offloading things and allowing a redundant storage, i.e on the laptop and separate drive. When it works, it's fine.Unfortunately, my is dead as a doornail. A hotel cleaner apparently bumped into with a card in it. Not something I would normally worry about. It turned out to be slightly sprung and a pin was bent. It was also popped open slightly. I have good mechanical skil and managed to it as it was. But a waste of time as it tuns out.It won't mount, thinks my cards are all 1.5 terabytes and cut life is complicated. It looks okay, but the internals indicate weak product control. If you can be sure you can always protect it, go ahead. I paid the orice of having it early."
1,Wrong item. This is NOT a Compact Flash Reader.,"I'm giving the lowest possible score until Amazon corrects this page.This IS NOT a Compact Flash Reader! I received the wrong item in the form of a reader for every other type of card other than Compact Flash.The item's picture is wrong as is the description.I've submitted a return request, so we'll see how that goes. I had better not be charged return shipping!"
1,"Yup. Wrong one here, too","I, too, received the wrong adapter (does everything BUT compact flash. I wrote Amazon, they apologized, and shipped another. It's due here today, so we'll see (the shipping notice has the exact same item number)....In the meantime, I do not understand why they don't correct the photo and description."
3,Beware the architecture,"This device doesn't fit your notebook's PCMCIA slot. Once again, they've changed standards and architectures, so check your computer's specs."
4,"Correct item, fast transfer, doesn't completely seat against side of MacBook Pro","Amazon did ship the right item, and at a good price as well. It transfers images much faster than the native software for the Canon XTi, but I wish it would rest completely against the side of the computer. (see uploaded image) It's still better than a separate reader and a cord, but I would feel better about leaving the adapter in my 15"" MacBook Pro if didn't stick out approx. 1/8th of an inch."
1,Forces me to restart,"I have a MacBook Pro, and after reading many reviews bought this product. The transfer speed is great, when it works. The trouble I have is every time I insert a card into the reader, I get that grey screen that tells me to hold down the power button to restart my computer, in about 6 different languages. I restart, after loosing progress on the things this ""grey screen of death"" as interrupted, then I am able to read the card just fine. This is a horrible manufacture default. I'd give this product 1/2 a star if i could and if i could take a screen shot when that grey screen appears, i would but this freezes my computer.I don't even know if what I received was a Delkin model as there is no marking on my reader at all. Bottom line: Do not buy this product."
5,"Fast data transfer, no issues for MacBook Pro","Easy to use and very fast data transfers. Worked flawlessly first time on MacBook Pro under OS X 10.4.10. A little carrying cassette would be nice, but I just keep it in a zip-lock bag when not in use."
1,Consultant,This reader is junk. It locks up my MacBook Pro every time I try to use it.Can't say anything about Windows...but if you are using a Mac...this reader is not for you.
2,Fast Card Crasher,"This item is a sure fire way to crash your computer by causing a Kernel panic. I think it fails because it is lose in the SXS card slot and it wiggles very easily, but I am not sure. Save your money!"
1,doesnt work with macbook pro--crashes,"updated photoshop and the driver for the express car. it still crashes my brand new macbook pro (which is up to date with snow leopard) so unless you enjoy recovering from crashes, find another way to interface with the flash cards"
2,Intermittent,"This product worked great at first on my Sony Laptop running Windows 7, 64 bit. Then suddenly it stopped working, or only works intermittently. I have no idea if the problem is with the card or somewhere else, but I can't rely on it to work any more."
2,Subsequent problems,"I read the other reviews and the words of caution on Delkin's own website. I had no problems. Once I downloaded and installed the drive, I imported photos directly from a flashcard to iphoto. I am operating a MacBook Pro with OS 10.6.2.I've experienced regular problems since writing my original review.The device chokes my computer while transferring even 10 to 20 RAW files. The files will transfer, but once I start opening and working with them, Photoshop Bridge/CS4 will stop responding and a moment later a curtain descends dimming the screen. A popup in six languages appears telling me to shut down the machine.I retuned to Delkin's website and to get and re-install the drives and any updates. The problem was not fixed.I'd hold off buying until the bugs are worked out."
4,Great CompactFlash Reader,I bought this CompactFlash adapter for use with my MacBook Pro. It fits in the ExpressCard 34 slot perfectly and I was surprised at how speedy the data transfer has been. It beats having to use one of my USB or FireWire ports to download my photos. I'm very happy with the product. My only criticism is that this is not a 6-in-1 adapter as advertised on Amazon--it's only for use with CompactFlash.
5,Good Summary of Collaborative Problem Solving,"If you can't read the book, or, if you have the book and want a visual explanation, this is a good 35 minute explanation of Collaborative Problem Solving. CPSing is a very useful tool for kids who are chronically inflexible, explosive and cannot emotionally handle limit setting. I also recommend CPSing for ANY teen."
3,Not viewed by me,"I sent this to my daughter who is struggling with an explosive child, in hopes that once her husband saw on video what he would never read in a book, he might be persuaded that conventional discipline does not work. Instead , HE exploded and stormed out of the house, hollering that no kid of his was ""defective"" etc. So it is likely that this family will not be getting any help for this tormented and tormenting child. Very sad for me."
1,BORING,"I hate to give a bad review to any author, but this book was so slow-moving and boring that, after repeated attempts to finish it, I finally gave up one third of the way through. Pacing of the story is very bad."
5,Best book I found on the subject...,"The book is starting to be outdated but I did not find a better book on the subject. Teaches a few assembly tricks to help you get a bit of performance. At least it covers Pentium (only Pentium I and Pentium Pro though). When is the second edition coming out? Unless you are already an advanced assembly programmer, you will learn something in this book."
3,"Although good, not Meeting the expection",This book is for you if you are first time writing some code keeping performance in mind but may not be very useful for experience programmer. I found it collection of many techniques at one place but nothing absolutely new.
3,ok bag,"I find it very big and heavy, even when it is empty. I wouldn't have bought it if i could have seen it first. And I also didn't like the spaces inside. I couldn't fit everything in it ...."
4,Nice Bag!,"Nice bag, plenty of room for all of my photo accessories. It has a very durable construction that seems to be of high quality."
2,OK if you're into electronic drum kits...,"As the other reviewer said, this is definitely not for the ""purist"" or anyone else who doesn't want to hear even more schmarmy versions of songs that, while great, tend toward the schmarmy. Great selection, but I couldn't take the same-sound, electronica organ backup for every cut. I much prefer ""Classic Country: Great Story Songs"" from Time Life. Just my $.02."
5,"beautiful, evocative tale for children and adults","We took this out of the library some months ago and it is still with me. The tale is marvelous: light, airy, beautiful but the pictures are what carry the book. They are carefully crafted and have a spirituality all of their own. I can't wait to get my hands on a copy and send a couple to friends of mine. Transportational!"
5,Unforgetable,"The Painter and the Wild Swans is one of the most beautiful books I've read. The art work is stunning, the story is unforgetable. This author's other books are also of equal quality. It is utterly, utterly incomprehensible that they are out of stock."
5,"Awesome, and stuff","Jethwani has written and illustrated a charming children's book about Petals, the angora rabbit, and the laid-back adventures she has when she escapes into her owner's attic hydroponic suite. What follows is Watership Down meets Cheech and Chong as Petals imagines with childlike delight how she might run amok in her owner's house, yet never quite summons up the energy to do so. Tremendous."
4,Great amount of questions,There is a lot of information covered in the questions of this book. I think it is very thorough as far as the type of questions you will need to know for the exam.
3,Decent for the price,I got these for my dad as a temporary thing for his '01 Dakota. I had to add two extra holes because the lower hole didn't line up in a good location. Three stars because for the price they are good and will do the job (stopping the stuff they spread on the winter roads from hitting the truck) but extra holes were required.
2,sucked,"even though there's more of a backstory in the remake. It still sucked. Selmer Blair who played Stevie Wayne sucked. She couldn't act up to par like the original actress. And of course all the actors in the remake were young as opposed to the original. Just because a movie is rated PG-13 doesn't mean it going to attract a wider audience. I saw this movie twice on Saturday in Long Beach, CA and only a few and i mean few people went to see it. Mainly adults who wanted to see if this stupid remake lived up to the original. Oh and the ending is so corny and over the top. This is like a Disney horror movie like The Haunting 1999."
1,"the "" SLEEPER "" zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz hit of the fall",Hey. Want to sleep. Do you have insomnia. Do you like to be bored. If one or all of the three apply to you go see this movie. Otherwise stay away or else you'll leave angry.
2,Not the part I thought,This is a connector for some sort of 2 conductor track lighting. I have 3 conductor 120V track lighting (which I thought was standard). Part might work fine but its not what I was expecting to receive.
5,Watch it several times...,"Probably my favorite full length surf film. If you update ""The Endless Summer"", modify the plot and give the characters dialog that says what Bruce Brown narrates, you have ""In God's Hand"". This movie has some great surfing footage - and a who's who in big wave surfing. And it attempts to show what its like to be a surfer. The ""actors"" are surfers playing the role of surfers - more or less themselves. The dialog and some scenes come off corny at times. This is an attempt to put what is usually experienced or thought into a film format - visual and audio. I saw this movie before I started surfing and although I heard what was said, I still didn't get it. After I was surfing, it was - oh yeah, there right! Like Dorian says to his girlfriend in the film - ""... if you understood what I was saying, I wouldn't be saying it"". Great film. Even better when watched several times."
2,Not very good,"Don't buy it, rent it. The plot sucks but the footage is very good. Matty Liu's whiny voice convinced me to stop using Qtips. Mike Stewart looked hilarious bouncing around on his sponge at Jaws. All other attempts at comedy in this movie were bombs."
1,Real surfers... but not a real surf story,"Sorry, while many of the shots are spectacular for both the scenery and the surfing... the attempt to be philosophical ruins the entire picture. Apparently the script writer is not a surfer and has never met a real surfer. The entire film comes off as a cross between a soap opera and a documentary. It reveals nothing of why people surf at all much less why they surf dangerous waves. And, the film does a discourtesy to South East Asia showing a beautiful area in a shallow manner."
1,Turn off the sound and use your remote for FF.,"Visually stunning, great footage, awesomely bad script and acting. Definitely see it for the amazing surf scenes. If you turn off the sound, put on your own music and fast forward to the surfing it is a five star experience. The dialogue is deeply memorable in its idiocy. I can still laugh when I recall it."
1,What a horrible excuse for a surf movie,"Please do yourself a favor and don't waste your time with this movie. If you're really into surfing then go check out the Endless Summer (1 or 2), the Surfer's Journal video series, Lost across America, Hit and Run, Thicker than Water, September Sessions, or look for the coming release of Shelter (a film by Chris Malloy and friends)....anything but In God's Hands. If you want the hollywood version of a surf movie, if you thought North Shore or Point Break were great surf flicks, or if you think Shane Dorian is cute you might like this. Otherwise, look elsewhere for a true dose of surfing's ""soul""."
4,Awesome and Inspirational,"This movie made me want to toss my career and buy a board- Though the acting was marginal and fantasylike, the surfing was magnificent and awe inspiring! I especially liked the way that 'fear' was portrayed and how you can't give in to it if you are a true adventurer- Great film- Excellent scenery- Don't miss it."
2,In Wad's Hands...,"This movie has a few good surf snippets, and a few good song snippets- but overall its just quite poor. The way the scenes are put together seems rather haphazard, the attempt at romance is weak, and the plot is difficult to get fired up about. It's not a 'terrible' movie, and is OK for a first watch. The attempt at doing a more 'artistic' and 'engaging' story revolving around surfing is always welcomed, yet, the film just seemed to spin too long in no-man's-land before the climax.The biggest challenge for a story writer and filmmaker is to keep the audience engaged between Plot Point I and II- that long middle section must maintain viewer interest. 'In God's Hands' must have more 'mature' conflict or at least move along at a steady clip. 'In God's Hand's' makes a noble attempt, but maybe something got lost in the editing process? Thus, I can only slightly recommended this film."
5,A beautifully poetic movie on the lives of surfers,This movie was incredible! It captures so much beauty in something that is called a sport and yet is more of a way of life.
5,I thought this movie was a brilliant surf movie.,"If you haven't seen this movie you must, it has what people never thought existed. It takes into a surfers mind , and thats not an easy thing to do. The music was perfect for every reason why this movie was perfect for any surfer who understands a wave and what it can do to your life. For better or for worse."
4,The Next Best Thing To Endless Summer II,"With great pro surfers and breaks that are breathtaking, this movie captures the art of surfing. It just doesn't focus on shredders, but true wave riders that capture the true meaning of surfing and who receive the spiritual side of the sport. With breaks from Hawaii to Bells Beach, Australia, ""In God's Hands"" is the best surfing movie yet."
5,An epic adventure from home for all surf lovers,"Three surfers, monumential waves and a great look into the hearts of unspoken friendship. In God's Hands shows how the passion for surfering leads three men across the globe to incredible locations and a friendship that not even death can break"
4,BIG WAVE ACTION,"Love it or Hate it, tow-in surfing is a part of life. This is a factional view of the tow-in scene. Stars a number of real surfers taking on real mountains. A pretty good movie overall."
1,Lame,"Horrible butt nugget of a surf movie. Poorly scripted and acted. Despite a few good wave scenes, it doesn't make up for the phoney self aggrandizing, pseudo intellectualism that goes on for the entirety of this pubescent, argo laden piece of crap. If you're looking for a good surf flick, avoid this one like the plague."
3,Old classic surf movie,This movie is one by boyfriend loved when he was younger. He still likes to watch it but it is a little strange at times. Shows some classic surfing though-good to try!
3,Soundtrack,"Whats that tune playing in the second half of the ""Jaws"" section, just after Dorian wipes out ? Its sort of grunge rock with whispered lyrics. Been looking for it for aaaaages...."
4,"Some nice cuts, lots of appeal","The Rips continue to deliver high quality modern jazz. Great performances all around and Russ is always superb. ""Paradise,"" ""Gypsy Eyes,"" and ""In the End"" were stand-out performances for me. I think this is one with the potential to bring in some new fans as well."
4,Needed return to prominence,"First of all on my rating the album to me is about a 3 stars but, i am a big ripp's fan so the 4 rating is out of respect. This album is more of the same from Russ Freeman, modern smooth-jazz with a flair of latin style. To me they just haven't been the same since left GRP in 96, there only good album to me outside that label was Brave New World (96) back then they're style was a lot faster, cunning and bold, Russ and the band would at times almost cross the line from rock to pop back to smooth jazz with sheer brilliance, the last few albums have been nothing different, from everyone else. With the exception of the song (In The End) the album was okay."
1,"Wild Card? Nothing ""Wild"" about it...","I have been a fan since their ""Moonlighting"" album (I have them all), but after hearing the ""Let It Ripp"" disaster, I figured they would come back strong. I was sadly mistaken. The latin flavor is OK, but it seems to have consumed their focus, making all their music sound exactly the same. I used to buy their albums sight unseen, but those days are over. This will be the first Rippingtons CD I will not buy. I heard it one time and thought ""Man, I've heard this before - it's called ""Let It Ripp"", and I refuse to get ""ripped"" again!"""
2,luck of real smooth jazz,"Here in Europe we were expecting with impetience the new Rippingtons CD hoping it would be radically diffent from the ""Let it Ripp"" album. Unfortunately, we are dissapointed again!!! I want to hear some real smooth jazz music from the Ripps like in pieces such as ""one summer night in brasil"", ""I watched her going away"",etc"
2,"Well, At Least It's Better Than Brave New World!!!","When I listened to this CD I actually expected to hear Gloria Estafan singing on some of these songs. Some of them seem like they were written for her. Wild Card has a few good songs on it. The title track is okay. Moonlight and King Of Hearts are better. The last good CD by the Rippington's was Weekend In Monaco. Changes in personnel, locations, and labels haven't proved to be too good for Russ's music. He's made his money and can experiment with various ideas. Wild Card is loser in my opinion, but at least it's better than Brave New World."
2,Another let down,"This is a very ordinary effort from the RIPPINGTONS. Instead of RIPPING they seem to be heading towards a RIP (REST IN PEACE). I am really very disappointed with their latest effort. Barring the title track, the remaining numbers are lame with some insignificant vocals thrown in as well. The group is known to move the listener's mind with their songs....none of the songs in this CD does that. The artists appear tired and sound as if they were in a hurry to get the recording over with.........Come on Russ what happened to your song writing ability ?"
2,Something worse than Let it Ripp?,"I didn't think the Ripps would release anything worse than Let it Ripp, but I was wrong. Wild Card is essentially an adequate CD, but truly a poor performance for the Ripps. When compared to earlier works such as Moonlighting and Welcome to the St James Club, the last two CDs are a complete wash. And what's the deal with the excessive latin leanings on this CD? It's extremely forced and really brings the album down a notch. The latin grooves were great on Life in the Tropics, but it doesn't work at all on Wild Card. I own every Rippingtons CD, but I feel this disaster may be my last contribution to Russ' retirement."
2,Going Downhill- where is the creativity???,Wild Card was a disappointment with two songs out of the entire album. I have all of the other Rippington albums and this is the worst one to date. The Latin Theme drowns out any creativity that came with other efforts. My brand new copy is going out on Amazon and get what I can out of it. Strike off another artist/group that I buy a new release without checking the tracks first....what a disappointment!
1,Another Disappointment!,"The last few Ripps cd's have been major disappointments to me, a life long Ripps fan. This is no exception.This one is the worse. I enjoy Latin flavored music but not as a major dose from Russ and the group."
1,Pathetic .,"I loved and still love them.But I am wondering...why aren't they more consistent?After the magnificent 'Life In The Tropics',apparently they got lost...in the tropics and can't find a lifeboat to come ashore.I do hope that Russ and Andi will helicopter them back with a less stale and more contemporary material.This one on this album is samey,boring and predictable."
1,SnoozaPalooza,"Garbage! Get Kilimanjaro or Tourist in Paradise instead. That's when they used to rip.. This album will put you to sleep for sure, Moonlight is the only track that comes close to what we love about the Rippingtons. C'mon Russ, get it together and put some balls back in the tunes!"
2,my thoughts,This machine totally rocks; I had a visual euphoric experience that has completely changed my opinions on what is capable in the medium. I never knew human eyes could perceive such beauty. This magical box has taken me places I never thought human kind could possibly visit. The vibrant colors and smooth animations lock your body into such an elated state only comparable to the highest clouds of heaven.
5,performe more than i expected,it is not a perfect projector but good enough for playing games and watching movies (not HD movie)at least for me.I use it directly to a white wall and it performes really well. Everything is good and worthy its price.
5,big bang for small buck,"damn good projector, bought it in january & its still working with the original bulb, but sadly the bulb already has over 2500 hour on it....that speaks for itself. (Time to buy another bulb)"
4,So far so good,I have used this projector for my conf room for about 1 month now and it seems to work as expected. The cost was very competitive after the mail in rebate so I feel I made a successful purchase based on the cost. It blows out some strong heat so I hope that is normal and not a sign it is overloading itself. Overall I would recommend.
4,Projector,I know it will give me good service. The only problem it has is the projected image is a little askew. It is just for the work I do and I will just live with it. The lumins are great! There is no need to turn off lights in the room to get real bright readings.
5,Ultimate projector and too good picture quality,"At this price i would have not got any better projector. The pictures are clear and crisp and the screen is so bright. Amply suited for both presentation, photos and movies! Strongly recommended."
4,Great value projector - goreous color!,"Very nice projector, with all the basics needed for most any presentation. Beautiful color quality; watched a movie (through VGA, playing the DVD on my latop) and it was great! Works well with a DVD player, too. Switching between inputs has a bit of a lag, moreso than other projectors I've used, but that's about the only thing I can think of as to why I didn't give it 5 stars."
2,Not an HD projector / No Zoom?,"I am the lead installer for a company that installs RealHomeTheaters, so hopefully my experience can be of some help.This projector has a native 800x600 SVGA resolution, so because it is a 4:3 format you will only have 480 lines of resolution in 16:9 (widescreen) mode. Also is has no zoom so the largest screen you can hope for is a 73"" diagonal in a 15' deep room.Unless you are looking for a super inexpensive projector for the kids to play video games on. Save up and consider a Mitsubishi HC1500.Hope this helps get your RealHomeTheaters off the ground!"
5,Thank you,"Thank you for a very direct and informative video, full of practical advice and easy to process information about a difficult subject."
1,not worth the money,"This DVD has some good information on it, but is presented in monotone by a man with a flipchart. He introduces others, but they never appear. Not worth the %60."
1,I can't believe it.,"I cannot believe that I just spent 60 dollars on a home-made video by a man who seems to have chronic heart burn and can only afford a flip chart. Oh my gosh, I have never felt this ""taken"" before. I expected a professionally done video that I can share with my Psychopharm class. I would be far too embarassed to show the class what I bought. I think my group can ""present"" better than that. Yes, he appears to know what he's talking about but the presentation could not be more dry and cost-effective.Still can't believe it..."
4,An excellent timer.,I bought the Intermatic Lamp and Security Timer because I do not have to turn on and off the lights in the evening. I am very pleased how it works. It helps to keep my house safe when I am not home. It is well worth the price.
4,Intermatic Timer,"Great product for what it is design for. In my case I use them as Christmas Lite Timers. Although the timer is for inside/indoor use only, I inserted a plastice zip lock lunch bag over the timer and used them outside/outdoors in bad weather, they worked great."
4,Intermatic lamp timer,I bought 3 of the timers and use them to turn lights on and off. The timers work well. I no longer come home to a dark house or get up to a dark house.
1,A bad lamp timer,This item is not accurate at all no type of directions came with it you just have to figure out how to set it by the time of Day when it goes on and off daily that's the only Way I was able to get it right I dobt recommend it I would prefer digital.
4,"Excellent, if you skip reading the manual","The timer is working great after messing up 1/2 hr with the supplied manual. I am not technically challenged, but the manual makes is pretty hard to start with, since I do not know what does teh green/red pins stand for. Anyway, there is a littl esticker on the back of the timer itself which has ""quick start"" guide and that helps finally. The timer works just fine, I do not have to worry about start and stop my christmas lights."
4,"Good Timer, easy to use","Not much to say. Works well. Has 2 on-off settings (use green for on, red for off), manual toggle switch, simple dial.NOTE: Only supports 2 prong plugs. It does NOT have the third (ground) plug."
3,"Great, inexpensive timer","This timer is perfect for lights. I just bought a second one of these for my fish tanks. I have both tank lights set on these timer to turn off at night. They work great, are small and inexpensive. They come with 4 tabs for setting two different sets of on/off times. It is quiet and easy to use. I would recommend this timer for anything that needs set on/off times. One thing I do not like about this timer is it is a little on the bigger side and it came only go into most outlets one way, because one prong is bigger than the other. The other thing I do not like is it only has one outlet and using a surge protector to extend it does not work."
1,Intermatic TN1 Standard Lamp & Appliance Timer,Unfortunately this product does not work as it should on a 50 Hertz voltage system.
5,Awakening,The music is electric and the voice is very magnetic. Together the combination helps bring to life some of the questions and thoughts that can follow an experience of loss.
2,You get what you pay for,"I moved to a new house last year and discovered my Cuisinart Coffeemaker wouldn't fit under the counter. With expenses mounting from the move, I went out and purchased this B&D model. The other reviewers were on target. It makes nothing but a mess when filling the water resevoir or just pouring a hot cup of coffee. I've learned to scoot the maker right to the edge of the sink to help avoid excess cleanup. It makes a mess! The brew basket requires some force to remove too. I finally learned to just carefully extract the used filter with grounds after exerting too much force a couple of times. With some force, the basket would pop out, sending wet grounds all over the place. I've finally given up on this coffee maker now that the non-stick surface has worn in several places. The plate is beginning to rust and I'm a little concerned about it rusting through and creating a fire/electrical hazard. It does make a decent cup of coffee but it's poorly designed and made."
1,Failed in 6 months. $7.50 to mail replacement.,The DLX900 failed in 6 months.GUARANTEE! Yes! Mail them the plug and $7.50 to ship another. NO THANKS!o You must pour coffee very slowly from this unit or coffee goes everywhere.o Coffee taste improved with replacement unit (NOT Black and Decker).
3,good but not great,"I love Celine Dion, and I love all the songs on this cd (99% of which ware from 'the french album'). My only negative comment was that I bought this LIVE cd because I expected the arrangements or vocals to be somewhat different from the studio recording. But pretty much she sings exactly the same as on the studio album. There is some variance in a few songs, but not as much as I would have liked. I would reccommend Lara Fabian ""en tout intimate"", it is the best cd I've bought in years and if you like Celine Dion, you're sure to enjoy it."
5,One of the best Celine Dion's CD!,"This CD is a beautiful piece of vocal perfection from Celine Dion. It doesn't matter if you don't know french language, her performance is unique, and gets to connect your soul with her voice. Buy it!!!!"
2,I was expecting more...,"This book feels like a collection of bulleted lists and short examples, with some nuggets of valuable information, but it lacks substantial details about how to strike up, develop, and (the real art) nurture these relationships.I was most disappointed in the editing (Crisp Publications). The short book abounds in incomplete sentences and even blatant redundancies.I left my copy on a plane, and, sorry to say, I don't miss it."
5,This book moved my business forward!,"Not only did this book contain very practical advice for developing a wide variety of business alliances, but it emphasized the value of building successful relationships in all areas of life. The principles that this book supports will move any business or person forward toward meeting their goals. I espcially liked the general partnering issues checklist a help. This book is packed with information that has helped me understand how to form productive alliances and gave me a ""heads up"" on the pitfalls as well. Thanks, Ed, for a great read!"
2,no weights given,"No weights are given in the recipes, just volume measure. (I'm quiet horrified that they gave her an award for this book just based on that).Any serious baker knows what I'm saying.Im really upset.. would never have bought the book."
4,For people who are really into baking,"Nice glossy pages, but wish there were more photos of the recipes. Have made a few things from this book, some I did not like but others went over well. The reason I say this book is for people who are really into baking is because making many of these recipes can require numerous different pans/forms, and some are very labor-intensive and time-consuming. Most of the time it's worth the effort though. The Butter Rum Cake is awesome!! Have made it twice to rave reviews - my father ate the whole bowl of custard that accompanies it.First few chapters make for interesting reading about the layers of flavors and how to achieve them. Like the side notes that Lisa Y. puts in the recipes about dough consistency, flavor additions, etc."
5,Baking By Flavor Delivers Delicious Results,"Last Saturday I made the Ultra Lemon Cake for guests I was having over that evening and the cake turned out perfect! My guests raved about the flavor and moistness with words like: ""bursting with lemon flavor"" and ""it's lemony all over"". I am not a baker. I think the last time I baked a dessert was to slice cookie dough from a tube. Lisa Yockelson's book has changed my attitude and way of baking forever. I must admit that I was nervous about baking adventure, but with the book's step by step instructions and helpful hints to guide me I didn't have any trouble. I recommend this book to novice and expert bakers alike. I was so pleased with my results last week, I made the cake again today and once again it turned out perfectly."
5,Baking By Flavor,"I found this book in my local library and after borrowing it 5 times I finally bought it. This book is great for anyone who likes to experiement with standard recipies by changing some ingredients. In addition, the recipies are anything but the standard that you find in most baking books. After making one of the incredible brownie recipies my husband declared that these are the only kind of brownies he wants, and he will never eat brownies from a box again."
4,very funny... but only to mormons,"The other person to rate this was not mormon, and thus admits he did not really understand a lot of the humor. I am suprised that he understood any of it. It is a book about mormons, written for mormons who are willing to laugh at themselves. It is actually very funny. But you probably have to be mormon to get it, and you might have to be non-mormon (or a mormon who isn't unreasonably sensitive) to like it. I imagine a lot of mormons will be offended, but I was not at all. I just enjoyed it"
5,Thud continues the tradition,"Thud is another great Disc World offering, in the Men at Arms sub-series. As usual, with the really good ones, once I started, I had to keep reading until I was finished, except when I had to pause to catch my breath! I also bought the ""Where's My Cow"" and it is a nice children's book. I was a little worried when I saw it pictured Vimes but actually it's a pretty close to the way I imagine him and Lady Sybil. Death has an almost cameo role, but it's special. Lord Vetnari is not present too much but helps get the story rolling; and we get yet another layer in the city known as Ankh-Morpork!"
4,Thud,Maybe not as good as Going Postal but that book went trough the roof (of the post office). But a very good if difficult book. Pratchet manages to tell a small story in almost every sentence. That is if you can find it.
5,Pratchett at his best,Pratchett has the nackto create characters that you think you have actually met in real life.Such brilliance and his stories always deliver.Forever a fan
3,"Solid, but that's all","""Thud"" is yet another solid Pratchett delivery. The novel provides a humorous exploration of the occult, but focuses mainly on the interplay between Ankh Morpork's various ethnic groups. This would be fine, if it hadn't all been done before!I suspect it's time for this author to move on with the series - new explorations and theme, but still retaining the original Watch core characters. Pratchett is smart enough to do this."
5,"Pratchett's very weird, I like that in an author","Having read EVERY Terry Prachett book in print to date, I can attest to how wonderfully weird he is. I hope he lives a long time so that he can produce many more treasures like ""Thud!"". His writing -- and twisted sense of humor -- only seem to improve with age. Although I'm not sure if that's with HIS age, MY age, or both ;-)"
3,what happened?,"This was a letdown. It felt rushed and poorly composed, the funny wasn't there, and the plot was awkward and seemed very implausible. Pratchett doesn't usually need to drag magical artifacts and impossible coincidences in to make his stories work..... what happened this time?"
4,Comander Vimes Stars,"Ever wonder how the Trolls and Drwarfs ever came to blows. Well - so do they, and one group of them is very determined to get the answer. In the usual Pratchet way, all will be revealed - or at least the interesting bits anyway, Vimes, Nobby, Carrot, and Colon come to the forefront and save their beloved city once again. Your knowledge of Discworld drawfs will be increased.My only complaint is that the Patrician has only a small role.... or at least that's what he would have you believe. The Unseen University makes an appearance again and even the Post Office shows up again."
5,Loved it!,"Although his sense of humor may not apply to everyone, I find Terry Pratchett's work to be clever and very funny- I think that 'Thud!' may be his best work as he parodies issues of discrimination and the nature of 'history'- plus a vampire and a werewolf have to work together- what's not to like?"
3,Please enter a title for your review,"i liked all the characters and the little creative details of the everyday aspects of the fantasy world, but the further i got through the book the more it seemed like there were pieces missing, typical novel stuff like it says they're in one place and then suddenly they're somewhere else, subtle bits of missing information. for the most part it was perfectly engaging, but untimately i'm left wishing i hadn't bothered with it, the frustration at trying to follow it in a few parts made it not worth it."
4,Good one!,"I have read all of Terry Pratchett's books over the years. I have enjoyed almost all of them. Thud is a great book that gives the reader additional insight into old friends/favorite characters, and introduces a couple new ones. It was fun to read and follow the clues to figure out who done it. Vimes has always been one of my favorite people; it was good to see him again. I gave it 4 stars because I was disappointed in his commercial plugging of the Thud game that has been out for a while."
3,"not one of his best, but still worth a read","This book changes gears a couple of times: it starts off as something of a murder mystery, but that eventually becomes just a subplot to the grand scheme. The book seemed a tad unfocused, as if Pratchett himself were improvising as he wrote and did some quick retro-editing at the end to help tie things together. Although I wasn't expecting ""great literature"" here, Pratchett often surprises me with some truly nifty concepts, so I've learned to just turn my brain off when reading him: go with the flow, and if he sneaks something really neat in, so much the better.Thud! struck me (nyuck nyuck) as having some good potential, but it didn't really live up to it, or at least could have been better than it was. I didn't hate it, but it didn't click with me as some of his other works have. Still, it had quite a few chuckles, and even a couple of laugh-out-loud moments.If you're a discworld fan, keep your expectations reasonable, and give it a go."
3,Not Bad But Not Great,"Great is what I always suspect from Terry Pratchett, but I didn't get it with this book. I didn't feel the humor was up to par. I know he was trying to make a political statement with the war between the trolls and the dwarves but it just wasn't funny but then again it wasn't serious either. I just felt like he was struggling. Maybe he was rushed by his publishers to turn it in. I don't know but I've always loved Sam Vimes and he just wasn't that great this time. I loved Sam rushing home to read to Young Sam but it got old after a while listening to Where's My Cow. I mean was that a plug for his kids' book or what. I just felt Mr. Pratchett borderline sold out with this book. Maybe the concept is getting old for him. I miss Rincewind and all the wizards too. I'll keep on reading them. I haven't made it through all of his Discworld books yet. I recommend this one just to get caught up on all the different characters."
3,Thoughts on Thud,"I really enjoyed Thud, though not as good as Pratchett's previous book, Going Postal. Lots of fun and highly recommended to read though."
2,The publishers should be ashamed of themselves.,"This is a gold-plated five-star book. Terry Pratchett writes superbly and his stories keep you gripped until you reach the end, then you start again from the beginning to catch what you miseed when speeding through the first time.Unfortunately the publishers, in their desperate hunt for Glod, have not bothered either to edit or to proofread this book. Whatever font size you choose with your Kindle, there is a spelling mistake every two pages or so. After a while this becomes indescribably irritating.There is absolutely no excuse for this breathtaking contempt for the paying customer. I am utterly shocked.Disgusting."
3,Considerably Long,"Mr. Pratchett's Discworld is a very intriguing creation where modern technologies are equipped with manual practicalities. Check out Sam Vimes' (the main character who is the Commander of the Watch) Gooseberry; it's a dilly! Different species i.e. human, dwarf, troll, werewolf, vampire, imp, etc. adorn a location especially in Ankh-Morpork City. Each group possesses its own eccentricities which result in hilarious happenings. Mr. Pratchett is funny and his way of writing is fascinating. Thud! is a tale of racial tension due to an aspect of greed and miscommunication whereby the police is involved in order to keep the peace. My only grievance is that the story is too long and the characters too many. The play on words, dwarf/troll languages, and slang of each class are creative and enjoyable. If only the narration is shorter then my concentration would have been piqued from start to end."
3,Disappointed - but it's my own fault.,"Okay, so you know how The Fifth Elephant was the best book I'd ever read until Night Watch? I was hoping that Night Watch would be the best book I'd ever read until Thud! For me this is not the case - Thud! lacks the excitement and energy of either of the aforementioned two and whilst Terry is a master at highlighting the foolishness of the worlds political situation at any given given moment I felt it became the driving force of the book and was a little over done.Only one persons view of course!"
4,VERY FUN...also very hard,If you like baseball buy this game. It is a little fun with something extra. If you are just buying it for the fighting its not all that VARIED or even that much on fighting. Its just a small bonus. So this game is a MUST-BUY even though it is quite hard sometimes. But I love the batting system on SLUGFEST and the pitching is not perfect but it is PRETTY good.
2,It is okay,"It's gameplay is okay, its graphics rule, and all the punching and kicking is okay. That is all I could say"
3,FAST TRANSACTION,"The transaction was very good, as described. My review on the book content would be I didn't like it as well as other books by Floyd Shaffer. It doesn't meet my personal need for what I am going to use it for. This is not a reflection on the seller. Otherwise, it would have very good clown skits for someone looking specifically for seasonal or holiday related skits."
2,Disappointed,"I was not expecting this set to be of non-original recordings and was disappointed that it wasn't mentioned in any part of the ad. Some of the tracks are pretty good, but I was expecting originals."
1,Trashy Re-Make - Beware!!,"There is not even one original song by the original artist on this CD. Maybe that's the reason it's so inexpensive. It consists of updated versions, admittedly by the original artists, or at least parts of their groups. Frankly, I'm surprised that an organization as reputable as amazon.ca would offer them for sale without a warning to unsuspecting customers. As a person who knows rock'n'rock history, particularly the '50's and '60s, modesty side, I would place more value on the jewel box in which this CD, and others like it, are packaged than the CD's themselves. The only reason I rated it ""1"" is that the option of ""0"" isn't available."
4,Twists abound,I don't want to spoil the movie so I will keep this brief. I was nervous about renting as it has no trailer but I am so glad we did. This movie will have you guessing until the end. It is not something I have seen done before. Not so gruesome but very stimulating for the mind. My husband and I both enjoyed this film.
3,Lacking in the suspense department,It was dark and at least original in its theme and story. But didn't pack much of punch in the suspense department and I didn't find particularly scary because of that.
2,BOOORRRIIINNNGGGG,"One word- boring!! I did not care about the character, his motivations, nor the victims because this movie was just too boring to get through. I have patience with movies and I love a movie that builds tension and anticipation but the only thing this movie did was put me to sleep!!! I have watched most horror movies made at this point and I'm not just saying this, I'm warning you- I found this movie to be really boring!!"
5,"Plot twists, and cinnamon kisses","We pop in ""The Legendary Spice"" to begin with the last part of a two-part episode telling the story of Miki's infatuation with Anthy Himemiya and the beauty of his music. In the second episode we get comic relief showcasing Nanami's need to boss around and be in charge of everything when she is introduced to the admirer Mitsuru Tsuwabuki. In the third episode we are given the story of the deadliest dueller on the Student Council, Juri Arisugawa. First love, and miracles are on high scale in this episode. This tape is a very beauful one, focusing on the two student council members rarely having the spotlight on their own. If you want love and laughs and know the story, you must get this tape."
1,very disappointed in study book,"i have been a dental assistant for over 10 years, my employer paid for me to take the danb test, a dental assistant teacher had recommended this particular book,i studied this book for over two months,there was nothing that i found helpful in this book to help with the test, as a matter of fact out of the 320 questions on the danb test there may have actually only been (maybe) 10 out of this particular book, what a disappointment, do not waste your money on this book. also probably 80% of the danb test was radiology."
3,This book needs some corrections!,"I purchased this book along with a few others to practice for the CDA exam. Most of the information was pretty good, but I found a lot of mistakes. Some of the answers are wrong and if I hadn't gone to school then I wouldn't have known the difference. Overall it is ok, but if you don't already have a vast knowledge of dental assisting then I would recommend a different guide."
3,"Really only for dyers, not knitters.","I got this book out of curiousity and hope that it might help me with my addiction to patterned yarns, which tend towards the expensive. The information on dying was not really geared towards a beginner like me, and the list of equipment,the amount of experimentation and the techniques I'd have to learn made me appreciate why the yarn I buy is so expensive, but I simply couldn't understand a lot of it. I have sent it onwards to a friend of mine who specializes in dyeing fabrics (in hopes she will venture into the world of hand-dyed yarns). In addition, the patterns offered to knit with the yarns provided were not at all inspiring. Definitely look in this book before you buy!"
2,Could have been better...,"I got this book for the 'secret to self-patterning yarns'. Okay, this really could have been done in a much smaller book, foccusing on just the dyeing technique.the author threw in a bunch of patterns with a recipe method that will allow you to replicate their results somewhat, but I don't want to replicate their results, I want my own. For getting folks started on dyeing, this book will be just as good as any other dyeing book, but would not be my first recommendation.The patterns are also a little disappointing."
1,Too Verbose,"I am an avid reader of fiction and was thrilled when I discovered another African American author of science fiction. I have attempted to read both of Mr. Bernard's novels and I was unable to finish them. And I pride myself on completing books even when I don't like them. I like the concept of the book, but I quickly realized that the writing was too verbose. It doesn't take three pages (small print, no less) to say that someone is crazy! I even tried skimming the long descriptions. But I found that I did not like or care what happened to the characters. I also could not get a clear understanding of who believed what or what he was trying to lead up to."
5,Highly recommended!,"I have loved reading this book many times to 3-5 year olds, and look forward to reading it many more times. One four-year-old has asked for it to be read to her at least twenty times-- she now has most of the words memorized :). The colorful illustrations provide lots to talk about with kids. Most children request it to be read again to them once the book is over. It acknowledges that there are many things to be scared of. This makes its statement that there are also many wonderful things to look forward really solid!"
1,Shipping method crushed this product,This product would have been fine except that who ever packed it crushed it into a book package which left folds in the rings compressor. This is not something you want. Because of the shipping costs it's not worth sending back. Don't buy this product using this method is my recommendation !
4,It is what it is.,"I had this book when I was a kid. Now my son is 4 and telling bad jokes of his own. The jokes in this book make a little more sense than the ones my son is making up, but they are all in about the same spirit.I do have fond memories of reading the book and telling the jokes. I am sure my parents might have rethought the book at times, considering how I would tell the jokes for hours and hours.So, ok, the jokes are lame; but almost magical for a young kid."
4,Got grip and smooth stops!,"Just replaced my bakes with EBC rotors and these Akebono Pro Act Ultra Premium Ceramic Brake Pad Set and so far they are really nice. I like that I barely have to press down on the brake pedal to get the car to stop. They have good grip. I currently drive a 2007 Infiniti G35X. Compared to my other pads that I just replaced, these are much smoother. Hopefully they last a while and I will increase my rating to 5 stars."
2,doesn't work that great by itself,"This stuff might work with a sealer or something, but it sucks by itself. Especially if you still have a little bit of gas in your tank. Just sticks to your fingers instead of the metal."
3,charlie rose with cast of the l word,"after watching a boring 35 minuites of gay talese, I was able to watch Ilene Chaiken, Jennifer Beals, Mia kirshner and Pam Grier being interviewed by Charlie Rose. It was informative and gave me some insight on the creation of the show."
1,BAD BOOTLEG,"I think these sellers ought to test this for sound before they try to sell it. It starts out all right but then the sound drops way down. You go to another track and the sound is still way down. Stan Getz- At Storyville 1951 actually sounds better, believe it or not."
4,Non-profit know how,"Stumped in your proposal writing? Enraged by another rejected grant request? What was the Stupid Foundation looking for that you didn't have? This book will give you answers: some original, others you can find elsewhere.As a guide to framing your proposal, what good proposals look, sound, and feel like, this book is extremely useful. In the heat of the battle to win funding, it's easy to succumb to tunnel vision, neglecting the foundation's point of view. McIlnay not only reminds the grantseeker that they have to sell their proposal, but explains what foundations seek. It's particularly astute on the political culture and internal dynamics of foundations.""How Foundations Work"" is written in a direct, though often plodding, style. But in a field where too much of the writing is namby-pamby, it gets points simply for uncluttered clarity."
4,Good Review for MBA Grads,"The Fast Forward MBA in Business is a very good reference for those who have studied business concepts, either in an MBA or undergraduate program. I think it would be good for any business person, whether they studied business or not. Few descriptions go far in depth. There are good examples given in case studies."
5,all your business are belong to us,"skip the degree, buy this book. it has worked for many in the mortgage and finance industry. Energy industry doubly so- Enron developed self certifications for all management level employees as did Madoff. Everyone can think like a business person after reading this book. It helps to be literate in the english language at least to the 6th grade level."
1,Don't buy this,"You can find all of these tracks on their seperate releases. It would be cheaper to buy each indivdual CD, or download them from iTunes. ALL of these tracks are availibe, no true rarities. Consists of March of the Pigs (pts 1&2), Fixed, Closer to God (pts 1&2)."
1,"Over-priced, under-cool.","This item is a cheesy bootleg, containing Import CD's you can get anywhere at a fraction of the cost. Even the t-shirt is pretty shoddy."
2,are you serious?,"well to be honest i have every nin album made and never once ahve i heard of this ""limited edition"" box set, its got eps that you can get no problem and and all it comes with is a shirt? now i understand its import but this is the first time ive seen this, i even ahve the ""into the void"" single that seems to be non exsistant, i wouldnt fall for this if i was anyone, but thats just me."
1,strange,"Intermatics design, which works with dozens of little on/off triggers, doesn't function as you'd expect. i.e. push one trigger in for on, push another trigger in for off. That approach makes your device turn on and off willy-nilly. Instead you push in as many adjacent triggers as you like to create the duration of time you want the device on.Yes, it's certainly one way to do it, but it strikes me as a baffling choice to physically map a reversible operation (on/off) this way.Each time you override the timer with the switch, the timer dial rotates one notch and your schedule begins to creep forward. So the timing just gets more and more screwed up. duh. This ain't rocket science guys."
2,"Nice concept, poor execution","I tried this for a few days but it hangs up partway through the 24 hours. Something inside catches and stops the timer from continuing to rotate. As a result, it's useless."
2,Why Change Something That Used to Work?,"I was hunting for the old Intermatic lamp timer, with the red and green thingies that you popped into the desired ON and OFF times. They worked incredibly well. Supposedly some people complained that they would LOSE the colored thingies and so Intermatic made a NEW timer that doesn't work. When you set the built-in thingies, they're backward. And the one we bought (suckers!) didn't even work backward. The clock mechanism would go to ON and the light would go on, and then off in about 2 seconds. We returned it. Cannot find anything like the ""old"" fashioned ones. We never lost the red and green extra thingies because we put them into a little plastic ""snack bag"" and into a drawer. I know -- rocket science!"
1,Shame on Intermatic,"This timer has a Manual override button, great, but when you use it, the timer changes the current time.There previous models worked great, but this one needs this fixed."
1,Horrible Timer,"I have returned 3 of these timer since January 2011, as of 5/15/11, they freeze up and will not work at all, they work for a month or so then just click if still plugged in but will not turn on lamp.Intermatic, please bring back timers with pins in them."
1,Real thing?,"How can this ""look and feel like the real thing""? To what would Toys R Us be comparing it?"
3,Gangsta-riffic,"This toy was fresher than yo' mama on drugs. No, wait, fresher than yo' mama addicted to PANADOL. This toy lasted pretty long, and it looked pretty fresh when i blinged it up in my pimp suit, with matching bling-bling no-less. He was pretty cool when i drove him around in my car, apart from the fact that everyone who saw him paid me out. I tried to teach him to breakdance, but he didnt move at all. Oh well. As he said in eps 3 though, ""chillin' in tha crib, i am""."
4,Piranha,It was a very exciting book. I'm very partial to Dale Brown's writing. I think I have every one of his books.
3,How about China against India.....,instigated by Tawian. Now there is foundation for a good story. Like all of his stories it is way too technical. In fact the first part was hard to read because of this. But once the action started I enjoyed reading it. The action took place in the South China Sea. Dreamland had to come to the rescue before a world war would break out. They did their heroic deeds such as blowing up topedoes that were aimed at the Chinese.I enjoyed how the Navy tried to interfer with the operation. Your standard military hogwash. But in the end the good guys prevailed.I would have rated it higher but the last section with Zen thinking his wife cheated on him really disapointed me. In the future I wish Zen would clean up his act.
5,Another Dale Brown Winner,"If you're used to Dale Brown writing fast paced exciting books, you won't be disappointed.The only problem with Dale Brown is he doesn't write a new book every week!"
4,UM takes a while to get use to!!,Tin man puts a modern spin on the wizard of oz. At first i didn't like it but after watching it a couple times i grew to like it.
3,Great Story & But Why No CC or Commentary??,"Loved it on Syfy! Decided to buy it for myself; unfortunately, it's lacking 2 things fir which I buy DVDs - Closed Captioning (Really now, who doesn't CC today?? I mean it's the 21st century!!!) AND commentary. The interviews w/ cast, director, et cetera, are OK, if rather stiff & canned. (Plus, you cannot hear the interviewer or the questions (CC anyone?) Much of the bloopers were cute the 1st time, but they are used several times & few are actually bloopers anyway. Did someone decide the Bonus Features were only about the crew? (It might have been more interesting if you knew who they were.) I've never written a review before, I am truly disappointed in this DVD set. I suggest that whoever is doing these bonus features watch them on Secondhand Lions, Farscape, & Season 1 of Burn Notice."
2,Creating a memorable character doesn't require a big budget,"I looked forward to a reinterpretation, instead: slow, no drama, numbingly episodic, simple uncreative direction, forgettable characters. This story just never builds any steam or dramatic drive. Alan Cumming, a talented and engaging actor, is given pitifully unfunny lines in an effort as comic relief. Neil McDonough seems to be channeling Dirty Harry area Clint Eastwood. I liked the lion, not many lines, but his actions did create a character that was true to itself throughout the film. Miss Deschanel, whom I have liked since 2002's The New Guy is the most disapointing. She has a zombie-like wide eyed non-reaction to every conversation/situation she is engaged in. If she doesn't get worked-up, emotional, caring, sad, scared, angry...then why should we?"
5,breathtaking blu ray mini series - a riff on Wizard of Oz,This series is NOT a new version of Wizard of Oz. It's a rather clever takeoffon Dorothy's adventures without the annoying high pitched munchkins.Imagery is just awesome and this blu ray edition is so good!The plot of this movie has Dorothy (DG) traveling the yellow brick road alrightbut the movie is all about the back story taken from the original book/movie.The tin man is a non-metallic sheriff in this movie but there are robotselsewhere and plenty of good vs. evil.My 11 year watched this and loves it but it will scare some 11 year olds.
5,Tin Man,"Excellent mini-series that gives a whole new outlook to the classic Oz stories of Frank Blumb stories. Once again a girl from Kansas meats heros, villians, witches and flying monkeys and an epic journey to find her past and save the future of the O.Z. (Outer Zone) definatley a keeper and a future classic."
2,"High expectations, big disappointment","When I saw the website for ""Tin Man"" I was looking forward to seeing this new miniseries. But soon I found myself struggeling to get through the three parts. What a drag. I have to say that the website looked better that the show did!It went on and on. They could have easilly made it a two-parter. I was surprised to see everybody on here liked it that much.One question comes to mind: Why was the series called ""Tin Man""? It certainly wasn't really about him.The writing wasn't that good. It often felt like a play. The music was pretty lame. Constantly hearing that same short theme through all 3 episodes.After seeing the show I cancelled my pre-order. Maybe some day at half price.Remco - Netherlands"
1,Tin Man,"Outstanding CGI, good actors doing fine job, but sad excuse of a story! (No value, No lesson, just politically correct...sad.)"
1,Not what I imagined,"Not at all like the wizard oz. I wouldn't say this is an update of the original classic, but rather just another movie."
1,Horrible,"what a waste....from having to watch the no talent""bug eyed"" Dorthy, to the dumb plot. I looked over to my brother gary and said, do you believe this sh#t, do you want me to turn it off?, he said, yea,and toss it over the deck and lets see if you can hit the tree next door. Ended up giving it to my co-workers kid who is 11."
3,Tin Man,"It's hard to be objective and not compare this miniseries to the 1939 movie 'The Wizard Of Oz', but as a re-imagining of the story I only knew from this version and the sequel 'Return to Oz', it actually was ok viewing. It is set much later than both of these movies, but I find it closer in style to 'Return To Oz'. It feels darker than the Judy Garland classic. As it was not expensive, I was happy to buy it for my collection, to be trotted out on a rainy day."
4,OK for a TV mini-series,"I was really looking forward to this series when it came out, I adore Zooey Deschanel. Slightly campy, but overall a good. I enjoyed watching."
5,very different,This is a very different Wizard of Oz. Odd but interesting retelling of an old classic. It is worth seeing.
4,Enjoyable,"This Sy-Fy mini-series was well conceived and executed. I enjoyed it when I first daw it on Sy-Fy, and again on the DVD. No extras, which would have been nice."
3,a great movie for fantasy fans.,"Nick Welling is a remarkable director. This movie paved the way leading to his next big miniseries ""Alice"" hitting the dvd world in March. This movie is a great movie to watch if you're into fantasy, and it has all the genre that a great movie/miniseries needs, it was a rollercoaster ride with a heart pounding twist at every turn. Was a great addition to the original wizard of oz, and the references are enjoyable as well as the characters."
3,Tin Man,Received this order really fast and in great condition. This is not a very good movie imho though. Highly recommend the seller though for other purchases.
1,"No Captions, Subtitles or SDH :(","I actually checked this out from the library not ordered on amazon. I was very much looking forward to this however there are no captions of any kind on this movie series that I can find. No closed captions, no SDH, no English subtitles. I really wish it was required for this to be on dvd's. so be warned there are no captions of any sort on this if you are hard of hearing or deaf and thinking of purchasing this."
1,Great movie... NOT closed-captioned!,I love Tin Man but I DO NOT love it on DVD. There's a federal law (known as the ADA) stating that all things on TV must be close-captioned for the hearing impaired/deaf. Imagine to my surprise and anger that this movie does not meet those standards.
1,I am truly amazed,"at how many people really thought that this was an excellent film and that Zooey Deschanel can act. This was a standard made for TV SciFi movie that had a lot of hype. By the time the show played, I was really looking forward to it. Unfortunately, it did not deliver at all and reminded me of SciFi's saturday night homemade cheap horror flicks.Ms Deschanel had one expression-----wide-eyed something for every situation that came along. The story lurched along with big gaps in the story line. I just read an article in a magazine that gave this show an A+ so I thought I would check here and see what real people were saying. I guess I am out of touch or something because I see alot loved it but for my part it was a very large disappointment.Belle"
1,What a Mish-mash!,"I don't think this messy production was the fault of any of the actors. A director seems to have been absent during filming. Zooey Deschanel (who I have liked in other movies) spends most of her time looking, either puzzled or defiant. She waves her arms a bit and opens her eyes really wide. All of the actors seem to be trying very hard to stay in character but there is no chemistry between any of them. On the other hand, the production is lavish and the special effects are very good for a television production. For all the money that was spent on this mini-series, there should have been more coherence, a better script and a director who was present during shooting."
2,NOT FOR CHILDREN!!!,"This is a dark, dark, dark adapataion of The Wizard of Oz. There is gun violence, murder, foul language, and adult images. OK as far as the story goes, but not for kids under the age of at least 14."
3,"needed a different ""D.G""","As a sci-fi geek, I liked the plot of the movie and all the actors except Zooey Deschanel. Next to the other actors she appeared stiff and inexperienced. Another actor in the lead would have made this movie great."
2,TIN MAN is great but,Sorry to say this . i am very disappointed with this TINMAN DVD. the DVD do not have closed caption or english subtitle for deaf people. Most of dvd do have closed caption or english subtitle. I am hoping that they will remade the dvd and add subtitle or closed caption. i have to return this dvd to store and get refund. I am wizard of oz dvd collector and i am so sad to return this dvd to store because of no closed caption or english subtitle!
2,Interesting but falls flat,"Alright Zoey was just terrible, she just couldn't act at all, just made a zoned out face. But the overall concept was pretty interesting, but i just cant deal with the horrible acting."
2,Great Story but truly disappointing DVD,"I was anxious for the DVD release of this miniseries. I had seen only one of the three episodes on TV and I was looking forward to a Widescreen DVD presentation. When I loaded the DVD the first thing I noticed was NO CLOSED CAPTIONS!! Come on, folks. To release a 2-Disc Collector's Edition and not even go through the minor trouble of including Closed Captions or other language subtitles in today's world is unforgiveable. As for Special Features, the ""Hilarious Gag Reel"" was a real disappointment - just cast & crew playing around trying to make funny. What should have been a solid four- or five-star rating gets only two from me for substandard DVD presentation."
1,DVD Freezes up,"This rating is NOT for the movie but for the bad quality of the DVD I recieved the DVD a few weeks back & just had a chance to watch - the DVD kept freezing up - VERY ANNOYING! Had to hit rewind & then go to scene before & FF back to where it froze - this happened about 30 times on BOTH disc's.... It said it was a ""new"" DVD - liked what I could watch of it but very bad quality DVD. I paid $9.99 & see now that it is down to $7.99 grrrr"
4,Tin Man,"If you're into the wizard of oz, like I am it is an interesting twist to that story. I liked it. It kinda sucked that it was on two discs and that you had to keep pressing play at the different starting scenes, but besides that i guess it's ok."
2,"Bad acting, bad writing and bad direction","It was just awful.A lot of potential in the premise (or rather multiple premises), but ruined by piss-poor direction -- that's the only explanation for the fact that EVERY actor in this woebegotten teleplay seemed to be reading their lines under the influence of a narcotic. Or under the influence of formaldehyde.And the lines they should've been putting some, er, acting, into were also dreadful -- some good ideas here (actually, too many... it would take an encyclopedia to map out the stolen ""homages"" to various genres) but terrible, terrible writing.For a low budget, though, the sets, special effects imagery and photography were quite good.Too bad overall.... I really wanted to like this one.Absolutely not worth paying any money for. Try to find it for free on the internet, but even that's not worth too much effort.(Too bad SyFy didn't pick up the Lost Room... that had real potential, unlike this clunker.)"
2,Power Rangers with Better Special Effects,"Ok, I'm sorry. I don't know how this got an average of 4 stars. Acting was horrendous (especially D.G's), characters were bland, screenplay was broken and the scripting was painful. As I was watching, I couldn't help but be reminded of Power Rangers. I gave it 2 stars - one for the CGI effects and the other for effort."
4,Great Movie,"We love this movie better than the original Wizard of Oz, not that the original was bad. Just we love this rebooted version more.It is a dip into sci-fi and fantasy, a bit darker direction as well. But it was great!I am certain most younger generation will love this movie."
2,Disappointed,"I REALLY wanted to like this. I love the concept and I am a huge fan of zooey deschanel. It starts off strong, some really interesting takes on the wizard of Oz story and whatnot, but it starts falling apart around the middle and the ending just sucks. And, as much as it pains me to say this, Zooey Deschanel is NOT good in this. I usually love her but for some reason in this series she just comes off as emotionless. Tin Man had a lot of potential but just did not work."
5,wonderful,the adventure is kinda like alice. different storys but you get the point. not the same story like others. i am not going to tell you much other then if you like alice waste no time to check this out.
4,Great movie,I loved this mini movie on si fi channel the only thing they forgot is the CC option. I'm surprised this was missed. I thought it was an automatic option with all dvd's.
5,"Not a remake, and never was","This movie is not a remake of the Wizard of Oz, and was never meant to be.This movie is about descendent of Dorothy Gale, the girl in the WoO. Her name is DG, short for Dorothy Gale, who she is named after.I loved this movie. But I love Alan Cumming's acting, and that is the reason that I originally watched it. He didn't disappoint.I watched it 3 mores times because I fell in love with the other character's, and the movie.This movie is dark. Very dark. I recommend that parents watch this before letting their children watch this. Only you know what kind of things that they can handle or not.I will never look at flying monkey's the same, ever again."
5,Terrific!,This is a wonderful take on The Wizard of Oz! It's fun and funny and also dark and dangerous! I loved this mini-series and would so love to see a follow up made!!
5,Imaginative and Exciting Re-telling of the Wizard of Oz,"This is an extremely imaginative and well done take on the Wizard Of Oz. There's trouble brewing in the Emerald City, and the true queen of Oz has been imprisoned and exiled. Dorothy must discover her past and regain her memories to help put things to rights. Helped by the Tin Man, an embittered law enforcement officer who has seen his family destroyed, and the Scarecrow (an excellent Alan Cummings) who has been the victim of a forced lobotomy, a cowardly lion of a strange magical species, (and what's up with Toto, anyway?), she travels through a dark police state version of the Emerald Kingdom, where the Wizard (Richard Dreyfus) is now living a reclusive life in the underground.Although there are a couple of spots where the show drags a little, on the whole it is tautly written with lots of delightful plot twists and turns and excellently acted. This is one show that you will watch over and over again."
4,Region Compatibility for International Buyers,Just letting other International buyers know that this DVD should work in any UNREGIONED DVD Player.I am from Australia and have an unlocked DVD Player and this DVD played perfectly fine with absolutely NO problems.I enjoyed the Series immensely. Only reason I didnt give it 5 stars was because I think it should of had a bit of humor in it and not been so dramatic.
2,Zooey? Try Pewey!,"The quality of the sets, costumes, and effects were pretty nice. With a few exceptions, the acting was wretched. Lines were delivered with as much emotion as I would expect from the stage crew doing a read through to get sound levels. Zooey Deschanel exhibits all the range of a cowbell."
4,Awsome,"This is a great remake of the Wizard of OZ. Maybe not as good as the original, but still a wonderful movie."
5,O.Z. is Aswome!,"This is, without a doubt, a masterpice of film! The story is fantastic, keeping the watcher on the edge of their seat. The look of the mystic land of O.Z. is breathtaking. The cast is phenominal to say the least, and the dialogue is funny and well writen! Tin Man takes the yellow brick road in a new direction!"
2,What happened?,"The story is an interesting derivative- I won't say adaptation, because it isn't even remotely like the original LF Baum books. That wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing, but as it stands I cannot recommend it. The story is predictable and poorly written. The director doesn't utilize the strengths of the actors, who have the potential to be good. Overacting seems to be encouraged. Some acting is better than others, but subtlety is totally nonexistent in any of the characters. Was this written for children? Not sure who the audience is supposed to be, but sure wasn't written for me.The production design was pretty good. The makeup was horrid. Being a fan of the LF Baum books, I wish that someone would do a series that was as scary and dark as the original books. Even adapted, the LF Baum books would be amazing with the right director, writers, production design and actors."
3,loved it,"My husband and I watched this, and loved it. What we didnt like was the ending. I wanted to see more. What happened to ""the O.Z"" after the wicked witch was melted? Did D.G. and Azkaldelia become close? We watched the whole three part series and were very dissapointed by the ending. Other than that it was a very awesome series to watch."
5,Loved it!,I watched this series when it came on television and wanted to see it again. Zooey Deschanel is wonderful. This was an amazing movie and I'm so pleased with my purchase!
4,Welcome to the O.Z.,"Tin Man starring Zooey Deschanel is a new take on The Wizard of Oz. I like this miniseries but I found part 3 a bit disappointing. If you can put up with Deschanel's bland, one-trick pony acting then good for you! Good thing Richard Dreyfuss steals the movie, he plays the Mystic Man. I like the references to the 1939 classic like the waitress outfit is fashioned after Judy Garland's blue & white dress, funny. Interesting film but not as scary as some of the reviewers have stated. Check it out sometime!"
4,Tin Man,"I was unsure whether I would like this movie, but after watching it loved it. The characters, even though obviously parallelling the Wizard of Oz story, are in their individual ways different. The imagery and story are for our times, while still retaining the integrity of the original story, even down to the flying monkeys. Very entertaining, and especially love Glitch as the man without a brain. I would recommend this movie to anyone that likes a bit of fantasy and a good story."
5,Tin Man review,"If you love ""The Wizard of Oz"", you will be blown away by this updated version.It's a fun and edgey play on the original storyline with a tinman, a man without a brain, a cowardly lion, and a wicked witch. And let's not forget Dorothy and Toto, too."
4,"Great start, anti-climactic ending, lots of fun","This movie is filled with great ideas and a compelling story-line. And it's all really fun to watch.It has some real weaknesses though:- Zooey (as DG) has some very confusing mannerisms. She moves as if she's trying to be 12, when she's clearly not. It kind of grated on me.- The whole ""Grey Gale"" thing was really unnecessary. (no spoiler, you'll see when you get there)- The ending is anti-climactic and almost ""under-done"".But the first 4 hours of the 4.5 are really lots of fun. The writer has built this great world that's well worth the journey."
4,A bit corny but I love it!,"I really enjoyed the hilarious references to the Original ""Wizard..."" movie. It's fun and captivating. Just what I needed to get away into fantasy."
3,"Fun story, mediocre visuals","This is a fun extension of the Wizard of Oz story (according to my wife it's an extension of the book, not the movie - I have only a rudimentary familiarity with either). Made for TV, it shows - very poor CG (screams Sci Fi original) and just worse than mediocre acting it relies heavily on the story which can be repetitious given the delivery format. As a Blu Ray I was not impressed. We originally watched the show on DVDs from Netflix and there's little in the way of a discernible difference to a non audio/videophile. So why did I buy it? We really enjoy the story, the fantasy is fun even if poorly delivered. And when I bought it, it was a single digit price for the Blu Ray, cheaper than the DVD copy.Do I recommend it? Eh...only if you know you like the story or you appreciate fun fantasy."
5,love it better than original,loved the new wave of remaking oz in our technology of movies. it was addictive to watch from beginning to end.
3,GOOD FOR THE COLLECTION,"This is a really good show to have around for the kids... Action, adventure, and otherworldly magic.... The references to the book are cool and the special effects were not overpowering... The story was sweet and not too complex....... The charecters were well rounded, ane interesting...... It moves right along, never a dull moment.. I know that this will keep my kids entertained... I really enjoyed the documentaries, and interviews......"
5,Great great movie,A fabulous story like no other. has quickly become a favorite of many of our friends and family. We love it also.
3,WHY?,"I only ask WHY are books and movies of purest fantasy always labeled or classified as SCIENCE FICTION? They have nothing to do with science, and this mislabeling makes it difficult to find anything that IS science fiction. WHY cannot these two categories be separated? SURELY it is not that difficult."
3,American release of Matari from 1975,"Don't really know where the title came from as it certainly didn't clue me in that I was buying a book I already possessed.It appears that the author, or someone with the rights (as Rhinehart is rather elusive) scanned a copy of the original edition and is selling this as a book-on-demand.I would recommend anyone who is really interested in this title to find a used copy of Matari, as this edition is filled with scanning errors which unquestionable detract from the pleasure in reading it. It appears that the edition of ""Whim"" available at Amazon.com is also printed in the same process, though I haven't purchased that edition. It is still available as ""Adventures of Wim"" on amazon.co.uk.The book itself is not one of Rhinehart's best, though it is an interesting fairy tale set in an ambiguous eastern land."
3,not a reference book,"Thought it was a reference book on mushrooms of the moors. It is not. It is a addictive story by a compelling writer that if you make the mistake, download and then page through will read. Curses! Great book and insight into a different world."
5,cookie,Boreham is a master at delivering spiritual truth through simple everyday examples. Even though he is from another generation he is still timely in his thinking.
4,Very good.,Excellent thought provoking essays. Would highly recommend this book. Unfortunately did not find very many Boreham books on Kindle. Have had to order hardcopies. Looking forward to reading them.
3,"Nice CD, nothing that really pulls you in though","Sublime is my favorite band, this CD, a 7 song EP, is a short Cd to play for anyone who has never heard Sublime. This gives the people some of the more popular songs ""40 oz to freedom"" and ""What I got"" to taste, but nothing that you would consider a great album"
1,Didnt work,"I got it home and hooked it up and the timer dial does not turn,It was hooked up exactly like my old (got hit by lightening)my old one worked for years, maybe just a bad batch but the price leaves me questioning about it being a ""seconds"" from some plant"
1,Avoid,"Disregarding the fact that this clock was in pieces by the time I received it and never worked, upon inspection I found the wiring compartment too small to accommodate #10 solid wire, also it only kills one leg of the power on a 220 circuit. I recommend a full size clock like the WH 40 or something similar. I'm a licensed electrician in Fla.,Cal. and Ark. and I found it to be a major piece of %#*&!"
4,Excellent Product - works as advertised,"Excellent product. The instructions were simple and I installed it myself- not an electrician. The only issue I had was the ""on "" function didn't work reliably at first. I installed one of the other ""on"" trippers that was included and it worked fine after that."
3,Water heater timer,"I just finished installing the timer. I purchased 8 feet of #10 2-wire with ground (I only used about 5 feet). The water heater is wired to 220 volts. The problem with #10 wire is that it is stiff and so hard to work with. The three timer terminals are small and there is just a small ridge of plastic between them so I had to twist the wires & make sure that the wires went in perfectly so there would be no shorting. The timer could have had a longer screws & wider spaces for the terminals which would have made it a lot easier for me - that's why I only gave it 3 stars.Otherwise it's just a timer that I use for 2 on periods, 9:30 to 11 am and 6 to 8 PM."
3,WH21 repair/ comparison with WH40 and T104 timers,"WH21 timer has replaceable 156EB1945A trippers.Sold as set with both silver ON tripper and brass OFF tripper.However, WH21 does not have replaceable clock motor.If the dial stops working on WH21, then the clock motor has gone bad or the circuit breaker is not delivering 240Volts to timer.By comparison, the WH40 timer or T104 timer are better value since they have replaceable 156T1978A trippers and 240Volt WG1573 clock motor.WH21 is rated for 23 amps, while WH40 and T104 are rated 40 amp and the contacts are heavier duty.[...]"
1,why would you only one element off?,this only turns off half your water tank. leaves one element burning continuously! buy the spdp timer. waist of money.
1,burnt wiring!,"this almost caused a serious fire, the wiring had melted and had burned the wall, luckily we noticed the burning smell before it was too late.this is a piece of junk do not buy it!!"
1,"Good timer, but wrong voltage",There was insufficient information on the Amazon website regarding voltage so I inadvertently selected a 220 volt timer when in fact I need a 110 volt timer to manage a gas water heater with a 110 volt electric exhaust fan that governs the activity of the entire water heater. Must return the item. More technical information at the Amazon website is needed on this and similar items.
2,OK,The Unit seems to be built well but if the ppower goes off you have to reset it I just flipped the breaker off and would not come back on.
1,Bad,"This was a defective product, after an hour installation, it did not workand had to be returned. Amazon refund was prompt."
1,DOA,Dead on arrival. Manual override allowed me to turn water heater on/off but timer didn't work. Returned for refund.
3,very difficult to install with #10 wire,"I finally got around to installing this thing last weekend. So I haven't had it long enough to make any comments as to the amount of money I have/will save. What I can tell you though is this box is TIGHT. Not 'tight' meaning ""Damn that tricked out Mustang is tight!"" I mean tight like there is hardly any room in the box to make your connections.If you are hooking up a small water heater that uses #12 wire it will be OK. But I had a hard time fitting #10 in there. There just wasn't enough room to bend the wire and hook it up to the terminal screws. I managed to do it eventually, but there was a lot of cussing involved.So if you like getting mad and frustrated while installing things go with the WH21. Knowing what I know now....I would buy the WH40. It looks to have a larger space for your wires."
1,I've had this item for almost two years,"It worked really well for almost two years. I think I calculated it was saving almost $10 per month! Two nights ago, this item failed. It melted all the wiring and a small fire/explosion happened in the box, causing the circuit breaker to short and our house losing power. This happened while I was on a business trip and my wife had to fix this problem at 455am. I am not happy.Worst of all, my house literally could have burned down very easily as a result of this matter. My water heater is a 240V, 18.8A.BE CAREFUL! DON'T RISK YOUR HOUSE BEING BURNED DOWN TO SAVE A COUPLE $.I am hoping someone from Amazon or Intermatic will contact me immediately to discuss this matter."
4,water heater timer,"The WH21 was less expensive than similar items at Home Depot and Lowe's, and the shipping was free. One of the two timers purchased from Amazon was defective, but Amazon immediately shipped a replacement. The timers were easy to install and program."
4,Saving $$$,"What a great product.I use it on our water heater (electric).Shuts off at night, turns on in the morning.Electric bill has been reduced. I would recommend this for anyone with anh electric water heater.GJFParma OH 44134"
3,Seasonal trading doesn't work like it used to,"Most seasonal trading is already factored into the price, right before the season starts. Something like 2 out of 10 seasonal trades work nowadays. Technical Analysis has eliminated many of the seasonal signals.In fact it is prohibited by the National Futures Association for brokers to even discuss or promote on the basis of seasonal trading. That says a lot to me.In the past 11 years I have been a futures broker, futures investor, and author of several futures books and I tell all of my clients not to rely on seasonal trades. And if they do follow seasonal trades use tight stops for when the market goes against you."
1,Short Lived,"I am a law student and my study schedule rarely works well with my two dogs. In order to keep them occupied, I routinely give them bones similar to these as ""get away from me for three hours and let me study"" treats. Each of my dogs finished its respective bone of this type within 15 minutes. They devoured them. While it is most likely not harmful that they swallowed the crushed bone chunks, it makes me worry. I will not, ever, give these bones to my dogs again. The reward, the time they spend chewing on them, is minimal while the risk, that swallowing bone chunks will hurt them, is higher than I prefer. In balancing these two aspects, these bones are worthless in my opinion."
5,It leaves me Breathless,This cd is definitely worth the money. The song is a great somewhat pop-ish song. The extra two songs Head in the Air and Judy are exellent too. they show the range of music and how well- rounded the Corrs are.
4,3 great westerns in a boxset,"3 Great westerns from Hollywoods golden age 2 from 20th Century Fox The Bravados with Greggory Peck and Joan Collins a good film with a few twists not your average western very entertaining. Broken arrow with James Stewart, Debra Paget and Jeff Chandler a great story trying to make peace with the indians beautiful Technicolor photography all the stars are excellent in their roles. the other film from United Artists was also very good a great western boxset to have in your collection."
3,Not as great as I thought,This was a Christmas gift for a friend of mine and although he liked them okay I was disappointed with the quality. The designs are silk screened on the towels which I could not tell from the picture. I would not buy this product again.
2,Disappointing,"With a name like Wolfgang Puck, I took a chance and ordered a case of this soup, thinking it would be at least as good as Cambells or Progresso. I'm disappointed. The soup has a gooey consistency and the predominating flavor notes are #1 salt and #2 dill. When my partner walked into the room before seeing the soup he said ""it smells like dog food in here, what are you cooking?"" and that was sort of the final straw. There are better options out there. I haven't tried any other flavors and don't plan to -- it's too bad that Amazon doesn't sell a case of assorted soups so you can try several and then order a case of the one you like the best."
5,One of Her Best,"Having read every book Rita Mae Brown has ever published, I have to say that this is still one of my favorites. The characters are, as always, beautifully developed in the ceaselessly witty storyline she is famous for. This is one of the few lesbian romances you can feel good about reading in public and sharing with everybody."
4,Great story on the May-December relationship,"This book is a bit slow to start, but after you get into the characters, you begin to see a wonderful display of what happens in a May-December relationship (one much older than the other). Throughout the story, you are given equal information about both sides, what they are feeling and how thier totally different lives feed off of each other, that is until they are in the bedroom. That is where they put aside their differences. A good read, a great storyline, and another brilliant book from Rita Mae Brown."
1,high pressure reg yes no claimed 1-60,"i have a mr.heater and i needed a regulator, couldnt find the exact one. so i bought this one claiming 1-60psi. i hooked it up and found the knob spins but know regualtion. it seems to regulate about 40-60psi. i opened the package so guess i cant return it . it appears it hasnt been dropped and i know i installed it correctly. i really needed a adjustable regulator i thought this was it. now im out 40 bucks and have a heater that still doesnt work."
2,"OK regulator, wouldn't buy it from Amazon","This is an OK regulator, with drawbacks..... it doesn't come with a hose, which I knew, but should have given more thought to. Also, the tank attachment is not the new standard, so that had to be replaced. Again my falt, I should have been more diligent. But the biggest complaint I have, which I also should have caught, is that the shipping price from Ace was more than the regultor itself, making a less than $20 regulator almost $40. I expect more from Amazon."
3,It's either on or off!,"This regulator does an awesome job of putting fuel to the fire! The problem comes in when trying to turn the flame down really low. The valve works either on or off, I can't turn it down low enough for a small flame like you would want during lighting.I did however manage to bring my 100qt crawfish pot to a rolling boil in 21 minutes. Overall good product but you do have to keep a safe distance while lighting."
1,Bad Product,"This product arrived damaged. Not regulate the pressure and there is no way to contact the seller for replacement. This type of article, should be tested before sending, as it is extremely easy to do. It can not be returned because only the shipping from Venezuela would be more expensive than the item itself."
2,Same old plot,Just a repeat of the same old lonely misunderstood kid perseveres over the odds and makes good plot. I got it for the 3D which was poor and difficult to watch. Way overpriced.
1,Boring,"Bought it on 3D DVD as it was the only family movie with 3D. Everything else in 3D is either horror rated R movies or documentary.There is nothing that attracts viewer's attention in this movie. Just some very slow developing plot about some wolf-dog hybrid. Too slow, nothing is really happening. Even children could not watch it - so boring. They usually watch every movie otherwise. Waste of time. Can't really tell any more than that because I could not sit through the end.3D image quality is bad, not realistic, Final Destination 3D was better."
5,Works Great!,"This long line is long enough to cover my tummy. I'm a fairly small women and I don't have a large tummy or chest and this bra works great. I just wore it today for my wedding dress fitting. It is comfortable and gives just enough lift without feeling like I will pop out. It IS thicker than some long-lines and there is no boning in the front so if you are looking for extra shape or are wearing a thin dress this one is not for you. My dress has a lot of detail and thick beading so the smooth thick front is perfect for me. It was true to size I got a 34B which is what I typically wear and used the tightest hooks. Still won't know how comfortable it is until the day of my wedding in June. Also haven't sat down in it yet.Over-all great fit, true to size, and good lift!!!"
1,This item is very uncomfortable.,"This is the most uncomfortable thing I have ever had. The side panels look like they are very thin, as others I have worn, but this one is not.It is sized down so I suggest buying at least the next size up to get a good feel. I wouldn't recommend this item if you are looking for something to wear, other than very special occasions.QT Strapless Convertible Bustier Bra (1100) 38B/Nude QT Strapless Convertible Bustier Bra (1100)"
4,Almost great,"This product arrived promptly. It came with an insert, and that was definitely needed, even though the person I bought it for has no excess fat. With the extender it fits nicely and does what it's supposed to do."
1,????,"I bought this because I like Bae Yong Jun. I have no quarrel with the sexual content, but for some reason I can't fathom I found this film boring."
5,Easy to Make -- Yes they are!,The pictures and descriptions are easy to follow. The templates are heavy plastic to stand up to the many hours of cutting I will put them through! The patterns included in this book will keep quilters of all levels busy. Make one block or an entire quilt - the directions for both are included.
4,This is a great study bible!!,"The NIV study Bible is one of the most user friendly Bibles I have ever read. The text is the NIV, so it is easier for ""us"" modern English speakers to understand. The Bible has plenty of maps, charts and biographical information to allow any one interested in digging further to find some very useful information. Overall, I really like the NIV study Bible because of the NIV text, the user friendly charts, maps and ither information"
2,niv bible paperback,Upon opening the Bible a few pages fell out. It was a bit of a disappointment. Otherwise all was pretty good. Thanks for sending in hurry.
5,Wonderful commentary for all walks of Christian life.,"I have used this bible for several years. I have also used others and each seems to serve it's own purpose. The NIV Study Bible is a good all around reference with it's fine commentary and study aids. Easy to read, enhances understanding, contributes to much personal growth."
3,an observation,"I have not read Christianity in Bakhtin, but the advertising blurb that represents it as ""the first full-length work to approach Bakhtin from a religious perspective"" might be overstating the case. Another book, Corporeal Words: Mikhail Bakhtin's Theology of Discourse, by Alexandar Mihailovic (Studies in Russian Literature and Theory, Northwestern, 1997), has already addressed some of the same ideas suggested by the title of the other book."
1,This game is proof that Jesus died in Vain,"I have never seen a product this aweful... a baseball game where the players fight on the bases? Ridiculous. A game where it is virtually impossible to hit the ball, and any hit you get goes stright into the fielders glove? Unbelievable. This is the worst game I have ever played. Thank god I rented this, because if I had purchased it I would have to shoot myself."
1,WHERE'S MY GAME?,"my mommom ordered slug fest for my birthday but the guy never sent it to her and i really love baseball so much.(ROBERT)MARIE CIAFRE PHILADELPHIA,PA.ORDERED GAME FROM AMAZONJOE212, NO ANSWER FROM E-MAIL AND NO GAME REC'D........"
4,Beautiful Presentation But A Little Small,I wish they had given the size of these in the description. They arrived beautifuly and of good quality just to small to hold up my larger earrings. My earrings still flop over.
5,earring backs,They are great! No more little backing that fall off and then my wife's earrings fall out and get lost. She loves them!
4,Worked well for me!,"I kept loosing a back to one of my daily earring sets. One of the pairs in this set works perfectly for them and despite running after a toddler all day long, the earrings stay in place. I'm happy I found these backs.As a note, I gave this product 4 stars just because I haven't used all the options so am not certain how the others work."
3,MIDDLE MEN!!!,"This is a good book for those who want to buy things at 2 dollars off the retail, chock full of middlemen that you have to call. If your looking for wholesale distributors for selling for a profit, this is not the book for you. They all have minimum orders of like 1000 dollars too!"
5,Wonderfully Informative and Beautiful,"Every museum, library, art class and coffee table should have this book. It is well researched, has rare and lesser known reproductions of exceptional quality, and simply makes a great deal of sense. The author is well informed, candid and a pleasure to read, and the artistry speaks for itself. Ntozake Shange's introduction is excellent as are the other contributions, including a listing of galleries in the United States. I highly recommend this book for anyone with a passion for art, African American culture, or plain old good entertainment!"
3,Mediocre,"If being able to read it in a day makes a book good, then this book is very good.I found it marginally enjoyable, but not great. The amount of drinking was distracting. It was difficult for me to take Caroline or her mother's emotional issues very seriously when they were half in the bag all the time. The whole time I was thinking, ""If you are over 25 and still drink like that, then that's your issue. Not your missing sister/daughter or bad father/husband."""
2,Too much unfinished business,"Don't need to say much about this novel, the author obviously didn't deem it worthy of her time to spend too much of it writing this. She left too many loose ends, and didn't have the courtesy to finish it. In the back of the book she was interviewed and she made too many excuses for herself. Why would anyone publish such a novel? Why would anyone put their name on it? Perhaps, Ms. Ward should have signed it ""Anonymous"" beause it was obvious she was just looking to be paid for her work."
2,Not in the same class as her first book,"While 'Sleep Toward Heaven' was great and original, this book was not original at all. I guessed the story ending _way_ too early. The story of the book doesn't do the title justice as the girl was not trying to be lost.A big disappointment from someone who loved Amanda's first book."
1,"To much money, its not a regular size hard coverd book",The story maybe good but its not worth so much money for such a small book. Its the size of a paper back book. I would have spent less money and bought the paper back edition instead.This should not have been sold as a Hard Coverd EditionBarb in Pa.
4,"Different, but engaging","This book was unlike anything I'd read in the past. It realistically depicted family and sibling relationships, and the narrator, Caroline Winters, was at once deeply troubled and hysterical. I was engaged in this book from cover to cover, mostly because I really wanted to know what happened, not so much because the writing was anything extremely memorable. But the story was engrossing and the ending did not disappoint. A quick summer read."
3,nice and easy read,"Liked the story and possibility of it happening in true circumstance.This is a light beach read that you can finish in a day or two that has suspense, family drama and some romance."
4,Great book!,"Beautiful writing! The book had me always entranced in what would happen next. I wish the ending would have a bit a tad different, but overall it was a great book."
3,"Too little, too late","The story built and built and built. I was beginning to see how few pages were left and I wondered how all of this could ever possibly be resolved. Rather than let us in on the plot early enough to enjoy the character development - everything fell into place at the very end, leaving unanswered questions and a feeling of disappointment."
5,Excellent book,"The story focuses on oldest sister Caroline, a lonely cocktail waitress in New Orleans - afraid to get close to anyone and still feeling guilty about the disappearance of her youngest sister, Ellie. Meanwhile, back in NY her mother and sister Maddy are still trying to deal with the youngest sister's disappearance in their own ways. Since the sister had never been found, the family cannot find closure. Then the mother sees a picture in a magazine that looks like the missing Ellie and wants Caroline to search for her.This is one of those books just makes you want to read on forever. I enjoyed it from the very first page - the wonderful writing, the disfunctional characters who were just as lost as the missing sister, the plot and the way the story unfolded.I will definitely be reading this author's other book."
3,It was just OK...,"I wanted to love the book... it sounded so good. I didn't feel that the characters were developed well enough for me to really care about what was going to happen and the ending was way too abrupt and - I felt - left too many things unfinished. I have found Cage of Stars, All the Numbers and Halfway House to be better written, more compelling family dramas lately. Those are great books- can't put down, can't stop thinking about great books. This was just OK... I really don't see myself recommending it to anyone."
5,a gem,"oops, I wrote a review, and it got lost....so here goes againThis book deals with a family who has lost (gone missing) a five year old girl. The family has not given up, and about fifteen years later, the search resumes in full force (not by the police, but because the mother will not let go). It is the story of three sisters, their mother, father, and other people in their lives. They deal with, or not, the child gone missing.The effects of the loss of this child, for her sisters, and her parents, is well written. Also, the search for her when Ellie's sister is an adult.Also, there is a resolution, extraordinarily well written, as is this book.I would recommend this to anyone, except perhaps a new parent (just because of the subject). It is well written, a good story, and, I plan to read more by this author.P.S. My synopsis is lousy...I would suggest that you read the book and don't listen to me."
1,you can't always get what you want...,"No offense to the hoards of people who love this book, but... I thought it got off to a good start but then the horrible writing killed it. It was like proof reading the work of a talented 8th grader.I only hung in there as long as I did because the story sounded interesting. I would have liked to see this great plot in the hands of a more capable writer. But as Mick Jagger says, ""You can't always get what you want."""
2,Just Ok,"After reading ""A Sleep Toward Heaven"" I was really looking forward to reading this book. Unfortunately I felt let down during the reading and it seemed that the ending was just too abrubt. It was no where as good as ""A Sleep Toward Heaven"". Hope her next one is better."
2,An unfinished story,"The author leaves too much to the imagination in this novel. The abrupt ending was unnerving. Had I known that the stories would go unfinished, I never would have attempted to know these characters. I am very dissapointed in the ending. The book itself was not one that was absorbing or a satisfying read. I was hoping the the ending would make the rest of the book worth the read. I don't think I have ever read a book that left the readers out on limb like this one did. The story is not mysterious it's unfinished."
3,Mediocre writing slightly redeemed by interesting story,"I might be one of the few who liked the ending. Actually, I hated the book in the beginning and thought it got better as it went along. There is a fairly good plot in here but the execution is marred by too many cliched situations, as well as inconsistencies in character development and in the timeline. There is a lack of attention to detail that bothered me: For example, the main character goes for a walk in the woods with a potential boyfriend. We are told that the ground is snowy and that Caroline's sneakers are soaked. But then the boyfriend whips out a blanket and a picnic basket and they have a long romantic picnic, complete with makeout session, in the woods. Um, what happened to the snow? Anyway, this is not great literature, but it's entertaining enough for a weekend at the beach."
3,dissapointed,"The cover and reviews caught my attention. However, didn't live up to my expectations. Interesting, but also a bit confusing with going back in forth in time. THe ending needed more closure for me. I felt like it just ended out of the blue. A nice quick short read, just don't expect to much."
3,Meh...,She could have done so much more with this book. Her writing is decent at best and I just didn't feel connected to the characters.
3,Meh....,"Comparisons between this and ""The Lovely Bones"" are inaccurate and undeserved. While Lovely Bones has thoughtful, engaging characters and a plot line that intrigues the reader, this novel has neither of these and leaves you feeling empty. You don't really care what happens to the main protagonist in this book as she is superficial and unrelatable.The plot jumps from one third person point of view to another, making the story jumbled and aggravating.Oh, and the author cuts the book off right when something in the plot actually happens that is interesting.If you want something like the Lonely Bones, then read that."
2,A lesser novel,"This story was not convincing. First, there is a dream sequence, about midway into the book, that is so linear and realistic that I felt embarrassed for the author. Second, the story came to a sudden and too perfect conclusion, as though the author surrendered to who knows what. Third, there's all this alcoholism, with no consideration of how the alcoholism dooms the characters' unwritten futures, despite the cheery ending. I would have been much more hopeful for the characters if Agnes never returned and, instead, Caroline and others began attending AA meetings."
1,Give This A Miss,"Besides the hum-drum nature of the author's writing, this book was impossible to read due to the slapshot editing of the various storylines. A reader has to be committed to learning from or finding out what happens to the main character from the beginning in order to go through the torture of reading disconnected storylines. In this book, from page one, the main character is a whining loser with almost no personality, a trait from which she never recovers throughout the narrative. I'd classify her as a fool on a fool's mission.Give this one a miss."
3,I must have missed something...,"I kept trying to be interested in the characters but simply could not bring myself to really care what happened to any of them. I know so many readers have rated this novel as inspiring, suspenseful, exciting,..all those adjectives that intrigue readers...but..sorry ..none of those applied to my idea ....I actually gave up about 3/4 of the way through which is unheard of for me."
5,I couldn't put it down!,"You'll be hooked right away! The characters are so real, you become entangled in their lives and can't wait to find out what will happen to each of them. The narrative from different perspectives tells so many stories all at once and enriches each character.And at the end, you'll wish there was more!This book is a great read!"
2,Confusing and unorganized,"I had read the reviews before I read the book and thought I would enjoy the book. I was wrong. It was confusing and unorganized, and most of all very unbelievable. Too many coincidences that were a bit too unbelieveable. Definitely should not be compared to Lovely Bones, not anywhere near that caliber of a book."
4,"Great Book, Bad Ending!",I loved this book....right up until the end. The author leaves so many questions unanswered! I was really let down when I read the last page. You can figure out what happened with the missing sister...but the character Agnes in the book...leaves you with many questions. I wish the ending had been different.
3,I'm in the middle on this one,"I loved the idea of the book but did not love the book itself... I didn't find myself attached to any of the characters and am still confused and at times felt the pace a bit slow. There seemed to be little continuity with the parents' relationship and Caroline and her sister's later life - everything was tied to the disappearance of Ellie. Of course, having not had this happen to me, perhaps I have no idea what I'm talking about. The concept that you live your life on hold is not something I know but something I could understand. I just read the book No One You Know by Michelle Richmond where in this book too, one sister's life is effectively derailed by the loss of another sister so it's clearly a common theme. I did not love this book but I did not hate it either."
4,A decent Ron,"Well, I got this Ron for christmas last year, and it's still pretty good. Not the best Ron. but a good ron."
5,"Japanese, but the same....","This is the Japanese edition: Only has Not So Beautiful People Mix, wich is available on part 2 CD. This has al remixes put together in the same CD. Plus japanese OBI in jewel case. It's not big thing, but it's japanese... great!"
2,Not worth the extra money,"I bought this mainly for the title track, but it seems I paid an extra 6 bucks or so for the Japanese liner notes that I couldn't read. At least two of the singles are available elsewhere, so I don't think it's worth the money or the wait."
4,pretty good,"i like this cd except for track 2...and people are complaining about his image maybe they should read some of his quotes cuz he isnt really antichrist if u read some of his quotes u'd get what i meanfurthermore he is not goth, he even said in an interview ""i'm sick of goth"" and the only reason anyone thinks he is gothic is cuz the media believes he is...as a goth myself even i see he isnt goth and i think the media needs 2 see that"
1,That's Marilyn Manson for ya..,What a freak. Im sorry but I just hate this guy.. girl.. whatever. Well really is he a guy or girl? Hmm.. the world may never know. Any how.. yeah I dont like Marilyn Manson. Only like one or two of his songs are good. This CD.. ehh.. okay.
4,"Very competent and enjoyable production, spoiled a little by the Commendatore","The female cast here is very strong with a powerful performance by Malin Brystrom as Donna Anna and a delightful performance of Zerlina by Sunhae Im.To me the male singers were let down by Allessandro Guerzoni in the role of Commendatore whose voice lacked the the commanding authority needed in the role. After a hair raising scream by Malin Brystrom in the last act, the entrance of Alessandro down the aisle of the audience towards Don Giovanni was an anti climax and waving the red curtain to simulate Giovanni's descent into hell was unconvincing. The use of red strobe lighting was an obvious omission and made this last scene less dramatic than it should have been.Apart from that this production is most enjoyable with great acting and singing accompanied by glorious orchestral accompliment. So, recommended but with the above caveat."
1,Didn't Work with SE47,The charger did not work with the phone. The seller sent another free of charge but it did not work either.
5,Excellent story line.,"I have searched and searched for the just the right books for my kindergartner. This series of books have been perfect. This book has a very good story, which has been hard to find in beginning reader books. It also has a reward for reading the book, evey time you read it you put a gold star (which are provided with the book) on the inside front cover. This has been a great incentive for my son to read the book and read it again. The words are just on the level of a beginning reader but it also has a very good story."
2,Incorrect measurements,"This trumpet wall mount WOULD be great, except the pegs are too short! The pegs are definitely not as long in reality as they are in the photo. When I put my trumpet on the mount, the pegs are only long enough to fit under the lead pipe, so when I leave it up, the trumpet is half held up, then tilts forward until the bottom of the valves is touching the wall, so my horn is just leaning forward the whole time and it doesn't look good. Seriously, who measured how long the pegs should be?? I only rated it at two stars instead of one because they got it to me so quickly, so kudos for that. But the mount is simply not worth the money if it can't even hold my trumpet up correctly."
3,GOOD FOR A COUPLE OF USES,"I got the liners for my French Bulldog babies...it seems to have worked alright for the first use (Keeping the urine from seeping to the floor underneath) then after you wash the liner a couple of times it NO longer absorbs the urine and keeps it from soaking your floor under it. For the price...I would not recommend this product. If you need something for a ONE time use...then it would be great. The one thing that I did like about the liner's is: it really does ""stick"" to the floor."
5,Excellent Primer!,"I originally checked this book out of our school library back in the late 60's. It, along with Ben Hunt's ""Indian Beadwork"", were the first books that really explained beadwork and all the other methods of making Native American items.This book ignited a longing to search out more information on the Native American people and their cultures and customs. Over the years, this research has broadened my knowledge and appreciation.The book is filled with color illustrations, information, and how-to's that are very easy to follow. I bought the book to share with my grandchildren (gotta admit it...as well as a present to myself), and hopefilly, they will find the same joy and wonder that I did. I hope you do, too!"
3,"Fun, But Not Necessarily Authentic","I agree with other reviewers that this book is a great beginner's resource with excellent illustrations and clear how-to instructions. As a history reenactor, however, I haven't been able to use much of the information because it describes making old-world items using modern materials and tools. It is therefore more of a stage costumer's guide, than a historian's resource. If stage costuming is all you're after, then this is definitely a five star book. If historical how-to information is what you're after, then three stars it is."
5,Having fun in Spanish,"When I teach the clothing unit in Spanish class, one of the culminating activities is a fashion show. I give the students 3 choices of music to ""walk the catwalk"" to and this is the number one choice of the girl groups. Students recognize it and like hearing it in Spanish."
4,nicey nicey,"Extraordinary Ordinariness is basically a little book containing photographs and an overview of the Smiths' history and music, accompanied by a 3-song CD. It's not particularly essential to own, but it's excellent if (as in my case) you've been looking for a copy of the rare song Jeane on CD. Jeane is actually one of my favorite Smiths songs, and I'd consider the song to be the best reason to purchase Extraordinary Ordinariness. But all in all, the whole thing is enjoyable as well."
3,"As a ""B"" movie, this one needs a lot of help","Michael Dudikoff is the only reason I bought this movie, after American Ninja, this movie gives a whole new meaning to ""B"" movies. and not in a good way. the acting is bad to say the least. The men in this movie are ether bullies or chicken. the scrip is so second rate it has a smell all of its own. I can see why it did not sell to well, SAVE YOUR MONEY , rent if you want to see how bad it is."
5,Deadly Shooter,The movie ( Deadly Shooter ) I recieved it pretty fast and great shape and I am real satified with there service. The Movie is a Western movie with Randy Travis which is a real good movie.
1,Dissapointed,"Although I think this is an adorable idea, these do not fit on red wine glasses, which normally are a larger glass. Not all my friends (nor myself) drink white wine, so was dissapointed that they wouldn't fit."
2,You get what you pay for...,"You get what you pay for and they are cute for the price, but not to the standard that I was looking for - I returned them and payed the higher price for the ones made of better material than that black foam."
1,Terrible movie,"Don't waste your time or money on this movie. I love Paris and had hoped to see some humor and some great shots of Paris. I got neither. How the movie got made is beyond me. Instead, buy Midnight in Paris by Woody Allen -- I guarantee you won't be disappointed."
1,Waste of Time and Money,"Though Delpy has been reasonably competent in earlier films, in this one - almost totally her product - she is not only boring but irritating. Pointless and tasteless, this film does not even show the wonderful city of Paris to good advantage."
1,terrible,"This movie popped up when I was ordering a couple of videos as one I might also be interested in ordering. First copy came defected. When the movie came I put it in and sat with my husband to watch, what I thought would be an enjoyable movie. On the contrary, it was awful. The acting was terrible and the plot was even worse. We didn't finish watching the movie. It went in the garbage. I thought it was even too bad to put in a ""Goodwill"" collection box. I didn't want someone else loosing money on a crappy movie."
2,Exactly what the title says,"This movie is exactly what the title says: 2 days in Paris in the life of a couple of hysteric, insecure and basically unbearable individuals.No plot, forced situations, a tad of overacting.Some American viewership is granted by the role of Adam Goldberg, who plays the perplexed, French-challenged fiancée.Barely worth your time."
1,"julie! you are beautiful, but not jean-luc godard","Julie Delphy--i used to see her ALL the time at rocket video in Los Angeles, checking out the better films: jean renoir, paul thomas anderson, bergman, bunuel. maybe she never actually watched them.SPOILER (of the first ten minutes--cause that is all i watched)>hhahahahahaaha: Adam Goldberg, a nebbish/oaf BEYOND, is so whingeing here that he is insufferable.mortifying all the way!ouch!!"
1,Two days you will definitely want to skip,"""2 Days in Paris"" starts off OK but the relentlessly obnoxious characters - especially filmaker and star Julie Delpy - quickly become tiresome and irritating. Much of the dialogue and many of the situations appears to be unscripted and go absolutely nowhere - case in point the scene on the Metro. Only Adam Goldberg comes out of this with any distinction. Delpy has almost succeeded in doing the one thing that you might have thought impossible - making Paris look unappealing. These are definitly two days you will want to skip."
1,"We get it already, you're a miserable cad!","This was a difficult movie for me to get through. In fact, I found myself completely disinterested and literally waiting for the movie to end. The male lead character seems merely an incredibly bad homage to Woody Allen.I've seen Adam Goldberg before in non-lead roles and enjoyed his style of sharp, sardonic humor, but it was just a non-stop whine-fest throughout this entire film...and utterly petty for the most part.Don't get me wrong, I love neurotic characters - Julie Dempy's character, for the most part, is fantastic - and I very much enjoy dark humor, but Adam Goldberg's character was just a complete drag and made it very difficult to remain engaged."
3,Naked Truth,"Roughly speaking, this is a story of a French woman settled in the USA and visiting in eight years her Paris-based family with a Jewish-American boyfriend.Surely, it is for those who like some male nudity, foreplay scenes and Paris in its routine day-by-day beauty."
4,Treat 4 Traveling Americans,"The film opens with a night-train scene from Venice to Paris that should resonate with anyone whose done train travel in Europe. In the scene Marion (Julie Delpy) does a photo montage complemented by her voice narrating that flys through a lot of information quickly, contextualizing the viewer within a foreign environment (assuming the viewer is American). This technique is one of the film's strengths and she uses it throughout to catch people up to speed on Paris life.The 2 main characters in love exemplify the difficulties and blisses of a cross-cultural relationship as they realize their affections for one another do not prevent cultural clashes. What's kosher for one is not for the other, but because they are open (eventually) they stay together.Delpy's mastery pushes the movie from cliche romantic comedy to true ""film"" enjoyable by people who like either. It will particulary appeal to Americans who have/like traveling in Europe and searching for connections abroad."
4,A great surprise-Delpy one heck of a talent,"Years after the romantic dramas ""Before Sunrise"" and ""Before Sunset"", Delpy revisits and redefines the Modern Paris blabfest movie with this really, really funny movie.A transitional actress, Delpy is obviously more talented than her type-cast characters let on.The movie is crude, funny,weird and a labor of love. I had no idea she could write this well-some really clever characters, events and twists. Also, a great vehicle for Delpy other side-yelling,paranoid and angry."
4,Two Days in Paris,"Having just come home from spending a month in Paris, seeing this movie was a real treat. It's not a movie about Paris, so much as it is a movie about two very different people grasping at love. Viewers looking for Eiffel Tower and Arc de Triomphe panoramas will definitely be disappointed; think more along the lines of too-real Sunday markets, Canal St. Martin, and the outskirts you just won't find in your Guide Michelin.The dynamics between the two protagonists are great; their stories are fascinating, and are slowly revealed, explained, and analyzed. This isn't a movie about truths; it's about the way people love, learn, and struggle to understand themselves and each other."
1,Ho-Hum,"I had high expectations of this movie after its review but it was about as interesting to me as watching water boil. Take these two out of that beautiful setting and the movie wouldn't have been watchable. Much of the dialogue is in French, which we're privy to with the captions. Adam Goldberg is excluded from many conversations at family meals, conversations Julie Delpy has with friends and old lovers who seem to pop up with amazing frquency in this short time. The 'eccentricity' of her artist father is illustrated in one scene by his scratching marks on cars with a key if they dare have a tire up on the sidewalk. Funny? I think not. Delray is a bit ditzy and screams a lot. Goldberg pouts a lot. In the end, they seem to have some sort of bond that never becomes clear to me. My recommendation is 'don't waste your time'."
2,I don't want to spend two days with this couple,"A young couple, Marion (Julie Delpy) and Jack (Adam Goldberg), find their relationship imperiled during a visit to Marion's home town of Paris. Jack is neurotic and insecure; Marion is flighty and insensitive. Both are whiny and judgmental. An amusing film could be made about this couple, but writer/director Julie Delpy doesn't seem to realize how irritating they are and wants us to love and identify with them instead.There are a couple of strong points here. Delpy's real life parents (Albert Delpy and Marie Pillet) are wonderful as her fictional parents. Also, the depictions of Paris's cab drivers, restaurants, and street life make it feel like a real city, not merely a picturesque backdrop for romance and intrigue. But that's not enough to save this self-indulgent bore of a film."
2,disappointed,Found the movie not as funny as I thought it would be. Also too exaggerated to the point of uneasiness where I didn't even recognized the French even though I'm a native from France.
1,All the funny parts are on the trailer...,"I looked so forward to seeing this because of the trailer. Little did I know I'd already seen the funny parts because of it! This movie tries way too hard to succeed. Instead-it fails miserably. Goldberg's character was extremely whiny, a hypocondriac, depressing and just mean! Actually, I liked neither character. The humor fell short most of the film. I can appreciate that Paris is an openminded city, but I fail to see how all the sex talk, 'dirty' words and innuendo would actually happen like it did in this movie. It was in excess.Lastly, the conservative bashing took this film downhill faster for me than it otherwise would have. It got old. Fast. Yeah yeah, we know. Hollywood is left leaning and thinks the whole world should be. We got it already.Bottom line: I kept looking at the clock every 2-3 minutes for it to get over. Next time a movie has quite a bit of 1 & 2 star reviews, I will pay more attention to it!"
1,For those who just don't get enough annoyances in life...,This is one of those films that seems to want to accentuate life's petty annoyances. It's like watching a Woody Allen movie without the jokes. It centers on a whining nebbish... and that's about all there is to it.
2,dissapointed,I was under the impression that the cord and socket comes with this order. When I received it in the mail all I got was the paper shade. What am I going to do with that?
4,Jefferson's Children,"I think Jefferson's Children: The Story of One American Family was a great book. The story is about a decsendant of Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemmings who asks other decsendants what they know about their relationship. Before I read the book I didn't even know anything about Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemmings and now I know so much more than I expected. Jefferson's Children gave a lot of information about Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemmings. The reason the relationship is so improtant is because Sally Hemmings was a slave of Thomas Jefferson. Jefferson was about thirteen years older than Sally Hemmings. Thomas Jefferson married Sally Hemmings after Martha Jeffers, Thomas Jefferson's first wife died. I find two things very interesting about Thomas Jefferson and his decsendants. Thomas Jefferson fought againts slavery but owned slaves. I think it is amazing how big the Jefferson and Hemming's family is."
5,what i was looking for,"wife found out she was in the family tree, now she has the book to prove it. good price and on time"
3,FOR SERIOUS RAMONES FANS ONLY,"Leathers From New York is a small book and a 4-track CD. The book (written in English and Italian) is an interesting (although poorly written) biography of the band, and contains some good photos. The CD is worth having for the songs ""Chop Suey"" (from the ""Get Crazy"" soundtrack, very difficult to find) and ""The Wonderful Widow of Eighteen Springs,"" which is the strangest song you will ever hear Joey sing. Actually, he doesn't sing, but chants over a bizarre drum track. The other two songs are a live version of ""Blitzkrieg Bop"" and the famous ""Carbona Not Glue."" If you have some money to spare and do not have ""Chop Suey"" in your collection, this CD is worth buying."
1,Price Alert- Way Overpriced!,"I got two of these from a hardware store to $10 apiece. They work fine, but the price here is rediculous."
5,Good outdoor lights for the money.,"Looking for some good outdoorlights (not high-end) that doesn't break the bank, this is your product. I've had these installed for about 6 months and they continue to look and work great."
3,poor calibration,"I bought two of these timers to control Christmas lights and found the calibration of the times to be off. If you can zoom in on the picture, you will see there are two clocks on the dial - the larger outer one where the pins go and an inner one to set the current time. The two are connected and you are unable to calibrate them - who ever lined them up did sloppy work at best. One is close - it comes on within 5 min off the 'real' time - the other one is a whopping 30m out of sync. If you are just buying one, fudging it might be no big deal but I am using 2 and trying to get my lights to come on within 5 mins of ea other has been tough.These timers replaced two light sensor timers that also were misbehaving so I guess this is just going to be part of my holiday theme from now on..."
1,WARNING! Prong Melted and Ruined our Outlet,"We purchased this for use with our outdoor Christmas Lights, and placed it under our covered porch so it was shielded from the elements. It was a pretty easy winter with the weather rarely dipping into the high 30s, but this plug on this timer still didn't hold up. The right prong melted and turned completely black shorting out the lights and ruining our outdoor outlet. We checked if the amps were too high, but that was not the case, so we have no idea why the product failed. I would not recommend using this product for outdoor use. It barely lasted us one month with light usage in a covered area."
2,Unreliable,"After less than a year of continuous use this unit has become erratic. It frequently becomes ""stalled"", but most often at the transition of the On/Off state. This makes it unsuitable for any unmonitored system requiring unattended, automated On/Off operation."
3,Good Value for the Money,"Bought this unit to control my walkway lights. The outer box is a rather flimsy plastic but seems OK to do the job. Two sets of ON/OFF ""pegs"" are provided which was more than enough for me. If you have only one On/OFF program, no place to store the unused ""pegs"" so you'll have to store them (lose them) elsewhere. Cord was reasonable length and the timer motor made no noise. Easy to use the the price is very reasonable. Let's see how long this lasts outside in Indiana!"
1,ANTOnline Substituted A Cheaper Brand,"I really wanted the Intermatic HB31R timer, and that is what I ordered. I've seen them in brick-and-mortar stores and it has the specs that meet my needs. However, the shipper, ANTOnline, sent me a CCI/Woods Model 59382 timer. Although this timer has the same electrical ratings as the Intermatic, the power cord is much shorter (difficult to install), the ""rain tight case"" is anemic, and the company is unknown to me (not sure how long this Chinese-made item will last). I attempted to contact ANTOnline, but received only auto-replies via e-mail, indicating a ""don't care"" attitude to me. ANTOnline even listed the Intermatic model on the packing slip! UPDATED August 7, 2011: Now I know how long this Chinese-made item will last. It has failed (if it is plugged in by itself, it trips the circuit breaker). So it lasted only 1 3/4 years (purchased Nov 2009, failed Aug 2011)."
5,Fun to make... and she still uses it everyday,My daughter received this kit when she was 5 - she is now 7 and still is using it everyday to wake up to. None of the paint or beads have fallen off and it has been knocked off her shelf quite a few times without any damage. She loves this clock especially because she made it herself.
5,Fun activity but the clock didn't work!,"My daughter received this for her 5th birthday and it seemed like the ideal gift; a fun craft project and a kindergarten alarm clock in one! She had fun decorating it. However, the clock didn't keep time, even after changing the battery. It's a dissapointment to her not to be able to use her work of art!"
3,I miss his essays!,"Bill James may be one of the most brilliant baseball analysts ever, and he put Sabremetrics (the advanced statistical analysis of baseball) on the map. But in my opinion he's even more gifted as a writer than he is as a statistician. And somehow I feel that these days, he's mainly lending his name to the work - worthy though it may be - of others, in order to give it instant credibility.Find yourself an old copy of This Time Let's Not Eat The Bones (or The Historical Baseball Abstract, or any of the early Abstracts), settle down with it on a rainy March afternoon, and you'll see what I mean. Bill, wherever you are, it's time to stop living off your royalites. We miss your inimitable, trenchant, hilarious PROSE!"
5,A must have for any fantasy baseball player,"Once again, Bill James is saving my behind. Last year, his handbook got me a playoff fantasy team, which my friends and I considered to be one of the best. I'm sure that this one will help me too. It has every imaginable stat, manager information, ballpark information and player projections. If it weren't for this book series, my friends would be hideously laughing at me for having the worst team in the league."
5,Far underrated,"I just discovered Melissa Etheridge through her single ""Come to My Window."" I'm 19, and most of what I listen to isn't much like her music. Maybe that's why I love this song. ""Cme to My Window"" is a classic that several artists have remade, but Etheridge is still the song's master. Her voice gives the song a calm but distinct strength that is hard to find in any music, old or new. If you don't buy this album, at least try something else from Etheridge."
1,who would actually buy this?,"Mr. Bernabo, why did you write a review about this? It cameout 8 years ago."
5,1982 Rock On,"12 selections:Hall & Oates - Maneater, Toto Rosana, REO speedwagon - Keep the fire burnin, Tommy Tutone 867-5309/Jenny, Men at Work - Who can it be now?, Eddie Money - Think I'm in love, Rick Springfield - dont' talk to strangers, Loverboy - working for the weekend, Dan Fogelberg - Leader of the band, The Alan Parsons Project - Eye in the sky, Air Supply - Even the Nights are better, Hall & Oates - I can't go for that"
2,Not good,Wish I had read the reviews. The movie was not good at all. Very very very bad. Terrible acting too.
1,Could not make it all the way thru. A waste of money!,"I would rather give it negative five stars! Everything about this movie sucks. The camera work is sucky. The zombies or ""infected"", were not very convincing. The story is dumb, and kind of seems like they were making it up as they went along. The acting is awful. I am getting tired of these stupid, unprofessional, low quality movies being sold on amazon for the same price as a good movie. In addition, I think it is very deceitful of all these people who give these films such good reviews when they clearly suck!. It is obviously just an attempt to lure people into renting them so they can get part of the revenue, I am sure. Even worse yet, is the fact that there are many other movies like this or worse available to view as well. Come on Amazon, enough is enough, have some standards!"
1,I hated this film,This was one of the worst low buget films I have ever seen. I wasted my money on this crap it looks as if it was shot by a 4 year old. People I'm telling you dont waste your money. The reviews are fake giving this film 3 starts if there were not starts I woudl leave ZERO.I believe the reviews were left by credits from this film. What a waste truly.And I have seen far better low buget way better.
2,ZOMBIE Wanna be,"I am a fan of ZOMBIE movies and this was a poor, at best, attempt at being a ZOMBIE movie. Man it really had good potential but the best part was the name ""DAY X"", I really liked that and give the name 5 Stars , unfortunately the rest of the movie had acting which only deserves 2 Stars! The acting and writers killed this movie!!!!"
2,Okay. I wouldn't watch it again though,"Didn't like this one much. But I'll give them credit. A girl that can bite zombies to kill them is something I never thought of. It was just so low budget and filled with cliches and horrible acting that I can't reccommend it. I wasn't even sure who the characters were! If you're bored on a rainy day maybe, but there's a lot better stuff out there."
3,"Ehhhhhh, not so much.","I'm a Zombie fan. I own over 20 different zombie films. Having said that, ""Day X"" pretty much came in at the point to where if the storyline wasn't great the movie would have had a .000001 star review from me. The special effects were non-existent and the acting rested on the shoulders of the main character and that ""Douglas"" guy. The sound was bad even for an Indie/B-movie type of flick. When the Zombies aren't believeable, something is wrong. Like i said though, the storyline was pretty original and there were a few things that would be considered new or unventured terrian, which completely saves the movie, more so than I thought when watching the first 5min. In all, I'd watch it again on a rainy bored day when I just wanna lounge around the house and watch random movies. If the movie somehow went Mainstream for a remake, I'd wait in line for it."
2,just another bad zombie movie,"Same old bad zombie movie. if u don't have anything better to do, then watch at your own risk. boring!"
4,Perfect!,"Independent horror film makers take note! Day X is a perfect example on to make an independent zombie movie. Look at the editing, the acting, the direction, the FX. This is what you need to aim for."
4,"For a low budget, it was good","The acting was not bad for ths low budget film, reminds me of the first Night of the Living Dead, but in color, the story was good."
1,sad attempt to ripp-off 28 weeks later,"I'll keep it simple , this movie is a sad attempt to recreate the magic 28 weeks later had. the acting is second rate, drags on and on and on, and has no variety in the story line. If you liked 28 weeks later you'll beg for this movie to end quickly. most likely you wont finish watching it. dont waste your 2 bucks!!"
3,Not bad.,"Pretty much everything has been done with zombie films, but I can't stop watching them because I'm looking to recapture that horrific excitement I experienced while watching them when I was younger. Most of these films that I've watched recently have been downright horrible, but I was pleasantly surprised with this one. Although this isn't good enough to warrant a purchase, it is certainly worth renting to watch with some other zombie film fans."
3,Pretty good!!!,"It's low budget and is great!!! I gave it 3 stars just because it was low budget, so I can imagine what they would've done with some more money!!!! worth buying!!!"
2,fish eye lens review,"Poorly represented. It appears that the lens fits directly into camera - it dosen't - it attaches to the camera lens (which is OK, but is not presented that way). Lens works as expected, just a bit bulky."
1,mlb slugfest 2003,I am yet to receive this game. I have not received MLB slugfest 2003. Please reply on the status of this order.
4,Full contact baseball--the way it should be,"It's about time someone came up with a baseball equivalent of NFL Blitz or NBA Hangtime. Just what is it that is so appealing about violent sports games? I don't know.It's fun to be able to knock over the basemen. It's also fun to take a cheap shot when you're the baseman and there's a runner on. Why is it fun? I don't know. It just is.You can bean players, you can become ""on fire,"" you can do any number of things. You just can't fight the pitcher (the game does that for you). I have to admit, that's a let-down.It's nice to get a light-mannered video game for a change. Not realistic? Who cares. Not overly challenging? Who cares. C'mon, hitting people's fun, and you know it."
2,Well what can I say,"Ok I write this review to be helpful to people. I LOVE baseball but when I got this game I was pretty dissapointed. I wanted to beat people up and all that great stuff, but when i got the game I found out that it wasnt all that brutal. Not only that it is WAY TO EASY. Also its not all that oriented with baseball, for example no free angents, no create a player, no tradeing, no farm system all you can do is e a team and play a season and thats it. I got the game then about two months later i brought it back and im happy i did."
3,MLB Slugfest 2003,"Overall, a good game. But i think people overrated it.Yes, the graphics are good, and yes the gameplay is good, but the game does get a little frustrating, but like I said, overall, it's a good game. But the thing that was most disappointing to me was the fact that there was no HomeRun derby. The game's called Slugfest, but there's no homerun derby. Just think about that."
3,This game is decent - just decent,"...Now for my review of the game. Like I said, it's decent. I was hoping it would be like NHL Hitz, which I've played and continue to play on a fairly regular basis. But SlugFest pretty much lacks everything that NHL Hitz has. What bothers me most is NO FIGHTING!!! I cannot express in mere words my disappointment the first time a batter charged the mound and I was rewarded with . . . a shot of the first baseman wincing at some figting SOUNDS. What is that all about? That missing feature alone knocks 3 or 4 points off this game. The rest of the violent action is limited to throwing some punches at the baserunners. That, also, is annoying because you can only do it if YOU have the ball and you have to keep doing it or the game will advance to the next pitch. Arrgggh, I'm getting frustrated just writing about it.It's fun to play, though, so I'd say rent it or buy a used copy. But don't spend $50 on it."
2,Only if you're a MIDWAY sports game fan,"I really didn't like this game. I don't know, I just don't like the idea behind a fake as hell sports game. Don't get me wrong I love the action, graphics, sound and easy gameplay but beyond that, I just didn't enjoy it like others would. This is fantasy sports to the max. Where on Earth can you see someone slide into second and give the 2nd baseman a ... whooping?I guess I just like a little realism to my sports games. I'd have to say rent this one first otherwise, you're wasting your money. Have fun and Happy gaming!"
1,"For a Boxing Fan, NOT a Baseball Fan","If you enjoyed Hitz and Blitz, you will enjoy this game. If you are looking for a good Baseball game, i would suggest All Star BAseball. The game play is terrible, and you can do things that you would be kicked out of the league for. Unrealistic and boring."
4,Great game...(not realistic),First of all. I would recommend MLB Slugfest 2003 to anyone...it is a very solid game with great graphics. At times this game can be a little violent...(like all other Midway games) but is still rated E for everyone.The code sysem at the beginning of the game is just like Blitz....u press all the buttons u can possibly press and see if any codes pop up. I gave this game 4 stars because of its lack of realism...i would have givin it 4 and 1/2 because the graphics abnd funness make up for all the problems...but still had to give it 4..so basically heres how I put it:Graphics 9/10Gameplay 7/10Realism 1/10Funness 10/10so basically this is a good game...and i hoped u learned stuff from my review...any way... I love this game...and if u buy it...i hope u love it to!
4,"Finally, an entertaining baseball game for PS2","Fun gameplay, great fighting and cool graphics. The game moves quickly and they do a great job of making a slow game more arcade-like. Its definately fun in multiplayer mode too. This game is better than the other ones that I have played as far as raw entertainment is concerned. My only issues are the following:1) No homerun derby.2) Pitches aren't accurate for each pitcher. (Half of them throw knucklers!?!?)3) All pitchers have the same generic delivery. (It would be cool if Byung Hung threw submarine).4) No automatic instant replay. This would be especially nice on homeruns.5) Hard to deal with flyballs. The outfielder is not automatically selected.6) No player of the game.7) Dugouts are flat walls that the balls bounce off of."
4,How Much Better Could a Baseball Game Get?,"MLB Slugfest stands up for its name. It's all about long balls. Great graphics, you can see the resemblence in the players faces. All the stadiums, too. You can even start punching a player!!!! Sometimes, you can knock it out of their glove and advance!!! This game is awesome. The only problem is, the balls always go long. It's either a line drive to the outfield, or a home run. Otherwise, go nuts!!!!!!!"
1,This game is boring,"The game has too many controls. It feels slow and gets boring after 2 innings. The pitching is awful, you either throw a ball, or the pitch over the middle of the plate. The fielding is bad, it is auto fielding."
3,triple play is still the best,"This game is awesome since your able to do things no other baseball game has been able to do. But it lacks alot of thing like a form of home run derby, trading players, and creating players, and even simple things like bein able to play in your choice of stadium. Other then that its a cool game. Player look real but there batting stances aren't true to life. Its the first baseball game I've baught that wasnt a triple play game. and I bet Triple Play 2003 will be better then Slugfest 20-03."
1,This game [stinks]!!,"This is one of the worst baseball games I have ever played. It is the blitz of baseball (i hate blitz with a passion). The pitching is terrible because you cannot tell where the ball is going or how much speed you can put on it as in Triple play 2002.Also the batting is etrocious and the fielding is even worse. I dont know how someone could give this game a good rating, and all the people i played it with said it [stinks} too. Some of the things in the game might be fun like having your bat on fire and hitting people, but I like a realistic baseball game and if you do to go for something else. I have played almost every good baseball game except for high heat if it is good. And the best one is triple play 2002. I say go for that or all star baseball 2003, both great games. But slugfest should be called [stink]fest 2003."
4,Kevin Matthews fans...,"two words:Jim Shorts! That's right. In case you didn't know, he is one of the announcers for this game."
2,NOT AS GOOD AS PUT OUT TO BE!,"This game is the dumbest game ever made for sports. It is so unrealistic and none of it could happen. It's like the blitz video games and is not worth the money. The fighting is the best thing about it, but it's still really fake. I mean, the players catch on fire and the pitching is weird. Overall dont buy the game unless you like blitz games."
2,not for first timers.,"Our college required these. This book sucks, thankfully I have a great teacher and don't need the book at all."
1,Disappointing,"The material covered in this book is basic and not presented in any better manner than any other text on the subject. The binding, paper, and quality of print is marginal, especially for the price. This is not a high quality book by any definition. Additionally, the spine has already broken on this book and that happening with very little use. Very poor quality."
1,"Beware, this book is probably NOT for you, real review","If you look at the two other reviews for this book, you'd think it's great. But then look closer, one of the reviewers has only rated 5 books, and they are all about nudism. Each book got 5 out of 5 stars and a great review. So, if you are a person who is into the nudity movement, or a naturalist you will love this book. If you are not, it will fall flat. The other reviewer has only ever rated one book. Hmmm.From the standpoint of a photographer, or someone interested in photography, you will probably be disappointed. The work is very armature. The images tend to be very poorly exposed, lack good contrast and without the best composition. The idea is good, but the execution is lacking. He needs to take a basic photography class. He self published his book. Get a chance to look at it before you buy it, if you like it, good for you, otherwise beware, it's all about nudity and not about photography."
5,Exactly what I needed.,Standard replacement for any light. Mounted right to the existing box. Install was easy. (Just turn the power off first!)
2,"Arrived broken, but works...","It arrived cracked in two, but after a little time with some Gorilla Glue it was good as new. Has worked as expected since then."
2,It's Terry and Crew...So why the 2?,"Daniel Amos, Lost Dogs, Swirrling Eddies...All the bands that Terry Scott Taylor has been involved in, or has influenced, might be represented here. The songs are good, the message clear. The problem is, TST, for whatever reason, does not seem to give his ""all"" in live performances. He sounds like he's reciting the words, versus singing them with conviction. The same passion that's found in the studio albums is not found here.I hate to say it, because I've been a fan for years.This is a good ""complete-your-collection"" CD, but beyond that, there is little here to rejoice in."
2,not worth the annoyance,"I wouldn't buy this thing again. We have it running a lamp next to the front door. There's no wall switch for that outlet, and the switch on the lamp is a bit cumbersome, so I thought the clapper would be a convenient way to turn on the light when returning home at night. It is, but the unit is way too sensitive. Maybe it's the acoustics of the room (hardwood floors), but just about anything will set it off. Ours has the adjustable sensitivity and even with it set fully to ""home"" mode (least sensitive) it gets triggered when not desired. It will eventually get scrapped when we get a different lamp with a more accessible switch, although I'm just about fed up enough to do away with it even before then."
5,World Class - Awesome,"I came across this little known and hard-to-find book quite by accident. The title suggests simply another sex education book, but it is much, much more than that! It is truly an introduction and detailed lesson book on the human art of touching. It shows how touching can be used as communication - with youself, with your children, with friends, with patients, and yes, with your loved one - involving every part of the body. No academic tome, it is a reintroduction to life itself, and refines the meaning of intimacy! A manual if you like; only 120 pages, beautifully written and illustrated - A MUST READ FOR EVERYONE!Recommend it? FOR THE ENTIRE HUMAN RACE!"
3,this is an ok dvd set.,"I got this a few months ago only because I didnt have the last two alien movies and the predator movies and this pack is okay. There are almost no special feautures so thats a bad thing, but get this if you want a cheap way to get all the movies without many special feautures. (I got it for 54$ at bestbuy)"
5,Great Collection,Wonderful collection. Enjoyed spending the day watching the Alien series and the another day watching the other four. Good price for eight movies.
4,Niiice!!!,"You have to buy this collection if you love all things Alien and Predator. However, I do wish that there were better special features for the films though. If you can overlook that, then you will be a happy camper. Still totally worth it."
5,OH YEAH!!,Love this box set. I watch it ALL the time. This is a great gift set as well. Love love love! Shipping was fast and easy! THANK YOU. WIll def purchase more form you guys in the future
5,8 Great movies for 1 great price.,"All the movies in this set are great, I've grown up on Dark Horse comics so I'm kinda a die hard fan. To see all the movies for $40 ($5 a movie) I think is a great price and a must have for anyone who is a fan."
3,not a bad bargin if you don't already own any of these movies,"I like the slim packaging (I really wish that all movies were now release in the slim cases...takes up less space). It would've been nice if a couple of bonus disc with material for Aliens, Predators and AVP would've been included. It's definately cheap to buy this set than all of the movies individually."
3,giessdorf showerhead,"i would think this is way better than speakman...but it's not, in terms of water flow or pressure.however, the seller is very easy to deal with, fast shipping and efficient, even sending me a new ball joint to replace the broken one from the showerhead."
5,Love Comes Softly Series - 8 Volumes,"Have purchased 7 DVDs of the 8 volumes in the Love Comes Softly series. Excellent series: clean, wholesome stories with Christian morals. LOVE THESE STORIES. Highly recommend to all. Waiting on the 8th volume to be released on DVD for purchase. All DVDs were good quality and shipped timely. Wish all 8 could have been in a compact set rather than individual DVDs. But I have mine! As always with Amazon.com, I had good service in a timely manner. Will continue to shop with them. Better prices!"
5,A series worth owning.,"Love Comes Softly Series, Vol. 1In the tradition of tv shows like ""Little House"" and ""The Waltons"" comes a wonderful tale. Based on a series of books by Janette Oke. Directed by Michael Landon Jr. who clearly is following in his father's footsteps. Women and teen girls will love, men should not shrug this off as another chick flick. A wonderful timepiece that shows Christian values.Katherine Heigl and Dale Midkiff deliver with wonderful performances."
3,DVD Series,"The only disc I have yet watched lost sound, but once I back tracked a chapter, the sound was fine. Technical glitch or permanent problem, I couldn't tell you."
3,Good Grapics/Lacks Plot,"The art is really awesome, but the stories are short and simple. The character and idea of the book are good. What it needs are longer, more complicated stories.If you're buying it for the art, it's good, but if you're buying it for the read, it's not worth the price."
1,It's a Lie,"The whole premise of this book is a lie. Cassie Bernall was NEVER asked whether she believed in God. Eyewitnesses say it never happened, and the 911 tapes PROVE CONCLUSIVELY that this exchange never happened. The girl who actually WAS asked whether or not she believed in God was shot 9 times and survived. How about a little respect for her and FOR THE TRUTH???? At the time this book was published, the author and publisher both knew the truth but published a lie anyway. If it is your aim to draw people to Christianity with this book, you are most definitely having the opposite effect, by cementing the idea that Christians are fake hypocrites. Of course I feel for her mother. I am one myself and cannot even imagine the pain of losing a child. I'm sure Cassie was a hero for many, many reasons but don't just make one up or print a rumor you already know to be false. This is not shining a light. This is just wrong."
1,The even MORE unlikely martyrdom,"This book is not moving well in the neighborhood bookstores around the Columbine area, because everyone knows the truth is not contained between its covers. The girl who really DID say ""Yes."" has suffered for the printing of this book. It was dishonest for the publisher to proceed with publication once the police informed them of the truth. This book does a grave disservice to the memory of Cassie Bernall, trying to force her into false martyrdom."
1,Cynical...,"I read this book and I have a right to my opinion.The negative reviews are disappearing. All the more proof that there are people who do not want the truth told. Cassie never ""said yes"" and this is conclusive from the witness sitting next to Cassie and witnesses near Val Schnurr, the girl who by all reports did answer ""yes"" when confronted by the gunmen. The only person who said Cassie ""said yes"" became physically ill when investigators confirmed that he was pointing in the direction of Val Shnurr's table, not Cassie's.But the point is to sell books and politicize a child's death. Regardless of what really happened. It's sad to see people profiting off of a tragedy."
5,The Best Book I Have Ever Read,"This book is the best book I have ever read. Actually, I don't like to read that much at all, but when I read this book, I could not put it down. I read it all in one day! It is great and I recommend it to everyone to read."
1,PLEASE!,No doubt the review below was written by one who will be making money from this. I cannot imagine that anyone else would provide a positive review of the obvious rip-off designed to take advantage of a popular lie.
1,Interesting quote,"This is in reference to alleged Prayer on alaska airlines 261 before it crashed. This seems relevant to the events of columbine as well.""If a private company tried to turn the Flight 261 disaster into a commercial for their product, an outraged public would probably hound them out of business. Why should we be any less offended when someone fabricates the details of a tragedy in order to turn it into a commercial for Jesus?"""
5,Dear Mrs. Bernall,"Cassie is such a brave teen for having standup to the gun point of two boys. I read this book, and it has even made me question myslef about what I would do in her situation. Cassie, an ordinary teen said Yes to God. Although she had a rough life, it ended surprisingly, and she made the best out of her last few years. Cassie as inspired me to be such a wonderful Catholic, and she has taught me to life Gods plan for us to the fullest.Sometimes, it may end when we least expect. I am thankfull for Cassie and Mrs Bernall for sharing her story with me. I am very proud to be enrolled in such a faith where anything is possible."
4,She Said Yes-Review,"This book told the story of the events of a student at Columbine High School, who died that day. The book has given inspiration to a lot of people who have read it. It shows how people who have gotten in to trouble in their lives can turn them around. The girl in the story did just that, she made her life better and she died because of her beliefs. It is such a sad story. It was a good book and give you a different view on life."
5,Real life story,"This book was very touching being the fact that it recounts the heart warming tale of a troubled teenager.Many teens who may read this book might be sharing the same expreince that Cassie once had. Cassie's brave mother,Misty,who is also the author,really hit close to the hearts of many. I recomend this book to teens everywhere."
1,"She said nothing, welcome to reality","Not only didn't she say ""yes"", she wasn't even asked the question claimed. Sweep it under the rug all you want. If Misty Bernall didn't want all the media attention, why did she write a book and then hit the talk show circuit? If she is such a devout Christian, why did she make the title of her book a statement she knew was a lie? I don't suppose she knew it would sell a lot of books.Wondering why people in these reviews are focusing on the fact that Cassie didn't say ""yes"" (or anything else)? The word you seek is ""hypocrisy"". Misty Bernall would do well to spend some of her new found wealth from exploiting a tragedy to buy a dictionary so she can look it up."
1,A WRINKLE IN TRUTH,"As many writers have pointed out, the ""trial by faith"" aspect of this story is complete fiction. More distressing, the authors knew this and chose to perpetrate the lie anyway.However, Misty Bernall is one of the most compelling monsters in contemporary fiction. The idea of a child entrusted to her care is more chilling than any high school shooting.Madeline L'Engle did so much fine work. It is truly a shame that she would fall in with such bad company."
1,Prophaganda...,I have one point that I'd like to make before anyone else starts spouting prophaganda about this book. THEY WOULD'VE KILLED HER NO MATTER WHAT SHE SAID. just something to think about.
5,I have a question,Dear Sirs: By my question I do not want you to think that I do not find her death absolutely horrible. I do have one question which was raised by one of the comments. Did she really say yes and where did this person get their information that they indicated she did not. What are the facts. If you can not answer this question would you be so kind as to point me in the right direction. thank you. bna@smart.net
2,I liked it but not that much.,When i first started reading this book i sort of liked it but then like in the middle of the book it kinda got boring because it stopped talking about her and started talking about other people so thats what i thaught about this book.
2,Not As Impressed As Some,"I finished SHE SAID YES in a very short amount of time. However, my opinion of this book is not as high as many others. I feel sorry for the Bernall family as they grieve the loss of their daughter but I feel that this book was written too soon. I feel that many times Misty rambles and jumps from one subject to another. Perhaps this is in part to her own wounds from April 20th not being completely healed. I also feel that she does a disservice by not confronting the issue that Cassie probably did not get the chance to say anything to her assasins that day. I reccommend the powerful books ""Rachel's Tears"" and ""The Martyr's Torch"" for more comprehensive and non-biased reading on the life of Columbine students. I do beleive in the life changing grace of God that occurred in Cassie Bernall's heart but found Misty's retelling self serving and sometimes incoherrent."
5,A True Heart-Warming Story,"I loved this book. When I first started reading it, I couldn't put it down! She Said Yes is a true story that tells the life of Cassie Bernall, who had a gun pointed at her at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado, on April 20, 1999. This story is narrated by Cassie's mother, Misty Bernall. This story brings us back to the real meaning of peer pressure and Cassie's hardships with both her parents and friends, through the high school life of Cassie Bernall, a regular teenager in the Real World. There was one question that was to be answered when a gun was pointed to her head. Q: Do you believe in God? A: Yes. Through this story, you will learn how Cassie Bernall spent her last minutes and how tough her life had been before this tragic event happened. If you want to know the true meaning of overcoming the rough times of life and what it really means to lose a close friend, seen through the eyes of a real person, read She Said Yes."
5,This was a wonderful book!,"This book, I thought was a great book! Parts of it would make me really mad and angery because I would want to know why someone would do something like that just because they believe in god. This book also gave you a lot of details and would show other people how solve their problems if they had problems like Cassie did in the story. If you read this book I promise you that you will love this book and enjoy it very much. So read this book!"
3,A Good Read,"I think that this book is a good read for anyone who wants to know about Cassie, her life, her struggles and her commitment to God.However, I am very skepticial about the notion that Cassie was the one who said ""yes"" to Eric and Dylan and I really didn't like the fact that the Bernalls said in the book that they can sympathize what the Klebolds(and I also assume, the Harrises) are going through and yet in the year following the release of the book, sue both families(which has since been settled). I thought that this was very disingenious and hypocritical."
5,A true testimony to GOD'S saving grace & tender mercy,"This book touched me for many reasons, but the overwhelming message was that we, God's children, must be ready at all times to stand firm in the saving knowledge of Jesus Christ. The Word of God tells us to never be ashamed of the Gospel - even in the face of ridicule or death. Cassie's life (and death) reaffirms my belief that God is in control and that no weapon that Satan attemps to form against His people will ever prosper. While her time in this world has ended, I take pride in knowing that she now sits at the throne of God - praising Him for all eternity! Thank you Mrs. Bernall for sharing your daughter's testimony with the world. Thank God for his unyielding grace and mercy that endures in the midst of every storm. Be Blessed!"
1,Very Michaevillian,"The notion of this book not being true but being good because Cassie said Yes many times before and the end justifies the means is pretty Michaevillian. If it isn't true than it should go under fiction, a story based on the Life of A Girl who Said Yes.I borrowed this book from a friend. While everyone was raving, I was unimpressed. If only for the occult letters and recipies for how to murder her parents that are illustrated here (which she had prior to her dramatic save by Jesus Christ! )you know the book is goofy. If this describes most teenagers, then Littleton will be known for it's bizarre teens as much as Salem is for it's witches."
4,The amazing life of Cassie Bernall,"This book is very life touching for a young teen like myself to see Cassie go though all these up and downs in her life. She is faced with many decsions in her life from her friends to her parents and relegion. The tragedy that happend at Columbine High School, where Cassie was very brave and stood up for what she believed in and suddenly her life ended that day. I want to thank her mother Misty Bernall for writing this book to see that her daughter is faced with the same problems as many other teens. I Believe after reading this book you really dont realize how much you should enjoy life while your here."
1,Skip it,"While the Columbine Incident was truly a disaster, and I feel terrible for all who died, this book isn't worth reading. This book is basically a mother, undoubtedly upset with the unfortunate death of her daughter, trying to put a positive spin on her life. It details all her struggles with different social groups and changing schools to make things better for her. As to whether or not she actually said 'yes' I'm not sure. I would give it the benefit of the doubt, but she apparently, by the details of her life, was not a very devout believer."
1,The title of his book is krok!,"Why would Misty Bernall sink so low and authorize (the publication) about her daughter's alleged admission in her belief in God when she was being killed by Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold last year. In fact another one of the victims, someone who survived the massacre, said yes. Misty Bernall is as low as the parents of JonBenet Ramsey, just trying to make fame and money off of her daughter's tragic death. I really think Ms. Bernall and the publishers should have thought twice in writing this book because this has caused much distress to a lot of people, including the young person who was in the library at the same time [of the massacre] and who actually said yes."
3,Urban Myth Development,"What really interested me about this book is how quickly the ""urban myth"" of a modern-day saint has developed. Read it not to discover the factual truth - but for a fascinating insight into the power of superstition in the American heartland. From a sociological perspective, it is interesting how the myth of 'Cassie saying yes' has been read back into her life - to produce the heroic sinner-who-became-a-saint. There are few things more powerful than our desperate need to search for meaning amongst the ashes of a tragic event - and after 2000 years it seems that myth-making about martyrs is believable and popular in our 'modern' society. And that is the very reason why this book will evoke such a powerful emotional response from many people."
1,dont read,"this book was, to put it nicely, horrible. i was forced to read it, and must say it was one of the worst books i have ever read. the only reason i think it has gotten good reviews is people feel sorry for those who died at columbine. i do to, even though countless children die each day, but that doesnt make this book worthwhile at all. im not even sure i believe this girl really ""said yes"" if you want to read a book about columbine there is another book about a girl who told the killers she believed in God. her name was rachel something and i thought it was much better. and if you want to read a book about teenage problems and overcoming them or whatever, there are SO many better books. its only good point was that it was a fairly fast read."
1,A lie,"This book is propaganda. It is not true - ""She"" never ""said yes"". This word ""martyrdom"" in the title is entirely misleading - a martyr dies for a purpose, for something s/he believes in. I'm sure Cassie was a very nice girl - but not a martyr. She died in an act of senseless violence. The fact that her very own mother is capitalizing on the death of her daughter is disgusting to me. It is sad that so many Christians rally behind this book without checking the facts first."
3,"A good read, many rumors that it's not true!","Ok, here's my take on the book. When I first read it, I thought it was a major tear-jerker, but then I read the reviews that everyone else put on this page. There's one from a person from Littleton, Colorado that said none of it was true at all. I'm starting to wonder what is fiction and what is non-fiction. Could Cassie the Martyr be as real as Puff the Magic Dragon? We may never know..."
1,she said nothing,"Of course, that's the sad reality and I guess I can understand why people distort it. It's not that comforting because it doesn't offer the simple vindication and easy to swallow narrative that fiction does. But fiction presented as reality can potentially be dangerous. I'd say this is the case with this book. This is a sad tragedy, made even sadder by the complete victimization that took place. The truly awful thing is - this book only lays the foundation for this heinous act to happen again.Christian martyrdom and victimhood only militarizes individuals who spread intolerance. Intolerance spreads hate. Hate causes actions such as this to take place. Is there any wonder that all school shootings took place in right-wing Christian areas?"
1,Beware! This is not a book,The Discription is false this is not a book. Do not buy it if you think that you are gettin a paper back book. Instead you will get a box of tracts about the life of John?
5,NO BOOK BETTER,"This book was great. It really opened my eyes to a lot of things and also makes me want to become more like Cassie, after the Youth rally that is. You really ought to read this book, you will be glad you did."
5,READ THIS BOOK!,"I can't thank Misty Bernall enough for writing this book. It shows us so much more about Cassie, and goes above and beyond what I had expected! It's complete honesty and hopefulness have given me a much stronger faith than I ever had. I am going through exactly what Cassie had gone through. It helps me soooooo much that I know I'm not the only one, and that some one as brave as her went through exactly what I'm going through. She got through the tough stuff and I know that I can now too, I know it isn't over for me. I know that it will help anyone who is or has ever had troubles in there life, and give them hope and faith. This is definitly a book that everyone needs to read! Thank you Misty and thank you Cassie."
1,The Big Lie,"It's sad that so many young people are reading this book and believing it to be true. Folks, it just didn't happen. Even worse, her parents knew it didn't happen when the book was published. Shame on them. Read the news reports for yourself."
1,This Tragic STory,"I feel that this story was just a way to cash in on a person who altimitly died, well rather tragically. I think the author made up a lot of things and as we all know, she didnt say yes, some other girl did."
1,Founded on falsehood,"It is a shame that this book is based on a lie. It is doubly a shame that so many readers are willing to brush off the fact that no such ""martyrdom"" took place, and to embrace a fairy-tale rather than the known facts. It is triply a shame that an excellent Christian writer like Madeleine L'Engle got roped into this venture. A sad example of a ""rush to judgement"" and a readiness to accept a pretty lie rather than the more-inconvenient facts, that is all-too-typical of the American public at this time in our history."
3,"She said, "" Yes""","Cassie Bernall was a student at Columbine High School.The day of April 20, 1999 her life was taken by a decision she was to make. Two rampaging students killed Cassie and others of Columbine High.A simple but truthful answer to the question,""Do you believe in Christ?""took a bullet into Cassie because she sid ""yes"". Now Misty Bernall,(mother), tells about how Cassie found a way out of her personal snares and, through her faith and a family's love, chose to embrace life with courage and conviction. Her belief in Christ has transformed her and others around her as well into a different person as they used to be.The true story of Cassie has touched everyone else around her and others from different parts of the world including me."
5,She said yes,"I think this book is worth 5 stars because it was awesome. My favorite part was when the author described her life before the Columbine tragedy. Even though her life sounded miserable I know she was happy to be alive. Over all it was a good, yet sad, book."
4,"Gripping and compelling, but it left me with a few questions","I really enjoyed this book. Cassie's story inspired me to begin with, but I was even more impressed by how she was able to break out of the evil influences of her life with the help of her parents.If you are looking for graphic details of Cassie's life before her conversion, they aren't here. Misty Bernall had the good sense--and the good taste--to keep them out of her daughter's story, but it wouldn't surprise me if some other writer put a story together and threw them in for shock value.What I didn't like about the book was the fact that Misty didn't say how Cassie's former friends reacted to her death, or how they were doing now. Wouldn't it be incredible to find out that ""Mona"" (Cassie's former friend, and the author of the notes) had made changes in her own life and was pulled away from whatever demons had a grip on her!But, all in all, this was a terrific read, and it was worth my time and money."
3,Not True...Informational,"The book annoyed me in the following ways:1. It's not true, from everything else I've heard and read. Another girl was asked if she believed in God. Not Cassie2. She could of made it more exciting, more intense. So we could feel her pain as Cassie's mother, but I felt nothingI did like it because I did learn about Columbine and how parents figured things out."
1,This item does not pick up hair or lint after 1st use...buyer beware,"I'm starting to think that the reviews leaving 5 stars are placed by people endorsed by this company.I'm pretty fumed by this purchase, I bought a cat hair glove from somewhere else and the glove does a BETTER JOB.Hopefully I can get an exchange for this item. :/Again, the fact that 90% of the reviews are 5 stars is a bit suspicious"
2,NOT easy to clean!,"Sure, it works fine in picking up lint and hair, but then the lint and hair are stuck to the thing and very difficult to remove. A bit of soapy water does not work well, as mentioned by other reviewers, and I agree with the reviewer who suggested they might be plants by the company. Since I end up spending 15 minutes aggressively scrubbing the thing and picking the lint and hair off, I may as well just spend the time picking the lint and hair off my shirts. Not to mention the sticky residue on my hands after cleaning it."
3,Expectations not met,"Like a chump, I generally assume things will work like they do for the criminally insane people who demonstrate them in the infomercials. This is a knockoff of Mr. Schticky, and like both the original and the knockoffs, it works fairly well once: it doesn't pick up as much as the sticky paper ones, but it does stick to pet hairs and lint. After about 5 washes, enough to clean perhaps two pairs of pants, it's pretty much done. After that, it's mostly just rubbery and will pick up about as much as a damp balloon, which is to say, a small but noticeable amount. I recommend this for people with kinds of obsessive disorders who need to clean the last few microscopic lints that no one but you might ever notice."
3,Pet hair really hard to remove,"When it's clean this thing does a great job of removing lint and hair. But after several uses it becomes harder to clean. Yes, tried the soapy water -- although just warm water is supposed to work. But once some cat hair gets trapped on the thing you have to pick them off one by one. Kind of a mess."
1,Not for pet owners,"I suspect this roller would work well for the average lint removal in a pet-free environment, but if you have furry friends in your home, don't bother with this... it doesn't pick up enough before losing its stickiness to be worth it."
4,Good lint removal roller,"Works well with lint, pet hair and the like. I miss a casing to keep the roller in - it is hard to keep it standing without it falling or getting in contact with nearby objects. A thicker roller would also be welcome. Other than that, a great product."
3,Miscategorized,"This is a fine book, but WHY is it cross-listed under ""Natural Disasters""? Geysers are no more ""disasters"" than trees or rivers are. I don't get it."
4,The Best Geyser Reference Book,"The Geysers of Yellowstone is best guide to Yellowstones thermal features I know of, but I wish it would include some of the non-eruptive hot spring and mud pots. Never the less, the book is packed with in-depth information on everything the ever erupted in Yellowstone at time. I am a Yellowstone visitor for 8 years running, and more than half this book, I still don't know! A MUST for any geyser lover."
5,Exactly what I was looking for.,"Last summer in Yellowstone National Park, I got lucky and was able to photograph severalgeysers as they erupted. I didn't know which geysers were worth waiting for or even howlong I could expect to wait. The geysers I got to photograph were pure luck, I was nextto them when they erupted. This book provides detailed information about what is knownabout each of the geysers in Yellowstone. Size, duration, interval, trails leading tothese geysers, as well as the best place to view many of these geysers. I purchasedthis book right after I made reservations for this summer.The price of the book from Amazon was several dollars less expensive than if I had purchasedit directly from the Yellowstone Association.Another book with great information about the waterfalls in Yellowstone national Park is...The Guide to Yellowstone Waterfalls and Their Discovery by Paul Rubinstein.This book proved to be very useful last year."
5,Great table for a growing youngster,"Purchased this table for my six year old daughter to use as a project and computer table. We had purchased Lifetime folding chairs in the past and found them to be the most comfortable, durable chairs we'd ever had. So after searching in vain for an inexpensive, durable computer desk for our daughter, it occurred to my wife and me that we should check to see if Lifetime had a table that would work. This does! It's far more stable than the card table it replaced. Easy to clean if our daughter decides to abandon the computer in favor of an ""art"" project. And best of all, it's height adjustable from a minimum of only 24 inches to a height of over 40 inches. My only complaint is that the surface does not work very well as a surface for her cheap wired mouse. But that's a weakness of the old technology used in the (had to be) pink mouse. An old mouse pad solved the problem.In our experience the products from Lifetime are the best."
2,A Little Disapointed,"The packaging was damaged and the table had a ""modest"" dent in it.But given my intended use it was ok. had I had a different use for it I would have returned it."
3,utility table,"I was happy with the table itself, however, I was NOT happy at all with the way it was shipped to me.The first table I ordered arrived with two dented in corners.I sent it back and received the second one in a slightly better condition than the first. One corner wasdented but not as bad as the first table.I recommend that the manufacturer pack it more carefully for shipping."
3,Rain Gards,"Arrived on time but one gaurd was slightly cracked. Rear window gaurds were not the correct size for my vehicle. not sure whose fault that is? Used the item any way, too much of a hassle to send stuff back. They are working OK and do stick well to the vehicle."
2,Didn't answer my questions,"This book tries in a small number of pages to answer too many questions, and the topics are treated superficially. Save your money and find your answers at the INS website instead."
3,heavy and not too efective,"I bought one of these mauls after reading in books about how great they are. I have both oak and pine fresh and aged and my ""tru temper 4lb super wood spliter"" out splits this maul hands down. I find this maul tends to bounce off wood when its wet. It splits dry wood in one swing but my 4lb does the same with much less energy. Also the rubber handle slips down the shaft. And since the handle is round you need to keep track of the angle of the head. Im 6'1"" and 170lbs, so it may just be my build that makes me like the light and faster axe. Maybe if your a shorter stockier person this may work great for you??"
3,Splitting wood.,This is a very heavy wood splitter. It really needs a longer handle. A person wrote in his review that he added some length to the handle and that is what we did. So now it is a LOT better.
2,Poorly balanced Woodbuster Maul,"The two main problems with this maul that I've seen.1. As people have said, the handle is way to short. In order to get a good swing you have to stand to close to your target. It's dangerous and makes for poor strikes. It also means it's difficult to take advantage of the extra weight of the maul.2. The handle was placed too far back on the head of the maul. It made for an unbalanced swing. When you raised the maul for the strike, I could feel the head wanting to twist in mid air.If you want to spend the time to weld an extra length to the handle, I recommend you save your money and just make your own maul. I've been swinging large axes and mauls for a long time, both homemade and store bought. My recommendation is save your money."
5,Pulse-pounding thriller,An exotic locale and a fast pace make The Pythagorean Solution an impressive debut. Thriller fans will be hearing more from Joseph Badal.
3,A Notch Below,"Jospeh Badal has written a book that has the formula that most of the thrillers have these days. An ancient secret discovered by current day people leads to an astounding discovery. The problem with this particular book is that it seemed too predictable to me. Set in Greece, this book is about a man who stumbles onto a map in a dying man's posession. The map is to a WWII era ship that holds untold treasures. The man, along with the victim's daughter, set out to find the boat and the secret it contains all the while being pursued by people who stand to be ruined if the truth is found out.A good, albeit a well worn premise that just does not measure up to the ones before it."
1,A word of caution,"I received this book as a gift and so felt obliged to read it. I'm sorry that I did. The plot is both implausible and predictable (that's quite an acheivement, I guess.) The dialogue is unconvincing, and the characters are collections of cliches. Much of the violence is gratuitous, and the pseudo-psychology surrounding the concept of revenge is nonsense. The ""solution"" to the ""riddle"" is obvious from the moment it's mentioned, but it takes the characters (one with a doctorate from Oxford) most of the book to figure it out. Finally, the depiction of women (violence against the ""good"", demonization of the ""evil"") belongs to an era that deserves to be long gone. If you liked The da Vinci Code, save your money."
4,Good stuff !,"A very enjoyable tale, particularly for those who love Greece, though I'm sure any fan of fast-paced thrillers will not be disappointed. There are moments of fairly graphic sex and violence, but don't let it put you off unless you're a really sensitive soul. The descriptions of Samos and Greek life in general only add to the authentic feel."
2,I've Got The Blues,"This was the worst book I've read in ages. I gave it 2 stars just because the storyline was so goofy I had to finish the book to find out how things ended. Except they didn't end! Wiley's questions about his father and all the wackos he ran into during the storyline were left up to the reader's imagination. I'm sorry, there is no way I could imagine one guy getting himself into so much touble, with so many bizarre characters. I realize there may by men out there in the world who think like Wiley, I'm just happy I don't know any."
1,I hated this book! It sucked!,"Barrett tries to go for the Carl Hiassen-esque quirkiness and fails big time. The main character,Wiley Moss, was so cold-hearted that I was rooting for the bad guys! And what's with the super-strange characters? A blind woman who drives a truck with the help of her son? Puh-leeze! I couldn't wait to finish this book so I could get rid of it and try to put the whole painful experience behind me."
2,Is this a child's watch?,"Just received and promptly returned this watch. While it looks good, the band size might be 6"", might. I have a 6 1/2"" wrist and if I would have closed the clasp [big if on that one] it would probably have cut off my circulation. If you have a very slender wrist it is possible this could work for you. I am an average size, not overweight person and this wouldn't fit me."
2,Somewhat disappointing,"I picked this up in the airport assuming it would be light and fun for a long int'l flight...having been in the service industry earlier in life I thought I'd especially appreciate it.However - I was disappointed. It was not as funny as I hoped and got old quickly, despite the outrageous nature of some of the stories. The attempt to make a quasi-storyline out of a series of funny anecdotes just didn't work for me."
3,not for someone in the industry,"for someone in the tourism industry, this is a rather boring read as nothing much is new under the sun! but as another person said, it is good airplane reading, very light and mildly entertaining"
5,The Skinny on Hotels,Juicy beyond details. Loved the inside scoop on behind the scenes at some of the best hotels in the London...and the crazy things celebs demand during their visits. No wonder the BBC launched an entire series based on the book (which is equally as entertaining.)
3,Disappointing,"Fairly entertaining, but underdelivers. I was expecting crazier tales. For example, if you are shocked by sex toys falling out of luggage, surprised that Texans and people from the Middle East tipping a lot and love hearing about supermodels using drugs and having crazy parties, this was written for you. Otherwise, it will just make you really glad you don't work at a hotel and wonder why anyone thinks it could be glamorous."
2,Didnt finish it,"Maybe I expected more, because it was recommended to me. But I'm still trying to figure why though?Really had no point to it and as a result I didnt finsih it. Maybe it goes soemwhere, but i didnt bother to try find out."
4,Highly amusing,"I was given this book from a friend who promised me, that as a frequent traveler, I may never feel the same way about my journeys after reading it. Boy was she right!The novel moves very quickly and spans a 24 hour period in a five star hotel. Throughout the novel we are offered disturbing glimpses of what actually happens when people use a place as their home away from home. Believe me some of these glimpses are very distrubing!The novel also demonstrates how hotels make money, how they deal with needy and demanding clients, what happens when they overbook and how they deal with some of the more ""delicate situations"" which arise.Very fun and informative!"
2,Feels a bit like an undercover exposé...,"I guess that's what to expect when a reporter and an anonymous hotelier with years of experience band together to bring you this story of one man's 24 hours inside a hotel. The narrator is a hotel employee who finds himself pulling double shifts. We get a glimpse not only of the wacky and sometimes badly behaved guests, but also of the hotel staff's struggles to please them. Some of the chapters did freak me out a bit, considering I read this right before I went away to a large hotel, but nothing TOO shocking here."
3,Well written and funny ... to a point,"I am far from a socialist, but this never-ending tale of how the mega-rich burn money left me heading in that direction. In that sense, it was so over-the-top that I became somewhat ""jaded"" by the end. The more interesting parts involved the awkwardness of ""walking"" guests to another property for overbooking, how to handle death, injury, etc. The grubbing for handouts, along with the details of all the schemes for (tax free) ""deals"" of the concierge, restaurant manager and other management staff, was rather a downer.One curious note for me: it was not made clear enough to me that the narrator/protagonist was male; enough so that the mention of an ""ex-girlfriend"" left me wondering if the person was a lesbian until I made a conscious search back for clues in the book. It shouldn't have been that ambigious."
3,Crave the harp,"Nice try, but the keyboard hardly provides a similar harp sound.The group would be better served either with a real harp or without it at all. The voices are nice and the selection of tunes is ok. A matter of taste, but if you want to hear the real thing to compare, try the group Chuchumbe."
5,Fantastic recording of mostly traditional Mexican music,This is a wonderful record of Mexican jarocho style music from Vera Cruz. They use traditional instruments as well as electronic keyboards and African drums. The result is an infectious modern interpretation that is faithful to the spirit of the music instead of being a slavish copy. Conjunto Jardin stresses the Afro-Caribbean roots of the music and even include a lovely song of African origin.
3,They are new group.,"They are new group.Good tracks are Guerilla Hood, Right Back and pass the mic. Their album gets 3 out of 5."
1,Garbage bought 2 one broke had to glue back together,"First off the air in side is nice and tight however the outlet side is loose, bought 2 of these 1 broke trying to remove the air inlet hose so I had to super glue it back together the air outlet side is so loose that your hose will fall off half the time. Not worth the cost, going to try some other ones."
5,Unique style,"My first listen-through of Urkraft was filled with some confusion. The rhythm- and melody-changes Thyrfing would execute in each song seemed random and unfitting at times. I gave it more time, listened over and over, and after a while it started to catch on. I started making sense of what they were doing. Those same changes along with their keyboard melodies began more and more to form into a musical journey for me, without which other music now feels lacking and stagnant. I feel as though Thyrfing taught me something with this album."
5,Great Combination of the classical and ethnic music,I lovedthe way the music combines the elements of traditional Persian music with classical as well as modern rythmes and beats. As you listen to the music you imagine the sea and it is almost like hearing the waves.
1,Persian Rhapsody,This CD is a poor excuse for Persian music! It is neither original nor creative. I filed it under never listen to again group. Save your money!
1,An embarrassment,"A collection of outtakes and B sides from the band's early days....most of which are poorly performed and poorly recorded.An embarrassment to the band, only ""Everything Flows"" (taken directly from A Catholic Education), ""God Knows It's True"" and ""Free Again"" prove to be listenable and they are readily available elsewhere.This cannot be an endorsed release by the group, it's just too embarrassing. Avoid this, just out of respect for the band itself."
1,Item was returned,Please be aware this item was return because it was not compatible with my computer.Please acknowledge return of this item which was sent back following your instructions. Thanks.
4,It is what it is.,"This book delivers what the Author wanted to deliver. An insightful book that looks at doing business in China.Wake up and smell the tea. China will again rise as the worlds factory. Yes, it will be built on the backs of the poor. It is what it is. To impose western idealism onto the Chinese is foolish thinking. More likely, as is already happening, US companies will begin lobbying to include practices in their business model in the US that they learned in China. China will change the world, not the other way around."
3,Entertaining but not very informative,"In ""Losing the New China"" Mr. Gutmann, with whom I had the mixed pleasure of actually chatting in an internet China blog, writes about his personal experiences as one of the many Western men you can see in China these days looking for fun, adventure, money, sex etc. Unfortunately Gutmann was already married before he left (alone) for China, so I guess he was forced to leave out some of the raunchier aspects of his sojourn in Beijing. Buy this book to learn a little about the atmosphere in present day fast paced money-chasing China by a guy who seemingly has difficulties keeping his zipper closed around Chinese women, hey don't we all? Don't expect any solid information or statistics etc. on changes in China. Oh, and the photoshopped cover image alone is worth the price of the book, always gives Chinese folks a good laugh."
4,Good Mix BUT...,I enjoyed the selection of these many hits. You will recognize all the melodies and know most of the words. The production of these songs sounds still in their analog (not digital) and gives a verying quality from one song to another. Steve G
2,100 Jukebox Hits: 50's & 60's,I purchased this Box set before from another merchant and returned it. These songs are not the originals.
1,A blatant Time-Life rip off!,This is yet another Madacy collection of '50s and '60s oldies trying to imitate the overwhelming success of Time-Life's box sets. The only difference here is that almost none of the songs are the original recordings; almost everything are crappy re-recordings done some 20 or even 30 years later when the artist's voice wasn't in the best shape. My advise to you is to STAY AWAY from collections like these!!!!
5,A great song and fabulous remixes!,"The first time I heard ""So under pressure"", I loved it. This cd includes So under pressure and five remixes-Soulseekerz remix-Very good! You know how some remixes drag on? This isn't the case with this remix. 5/5Extended remix-Fabulous!! 5/5Steve Pitron remix-not as good as the first two but still excellent 4/5Riffs & Rays mix-my favorite remix off of the single. The beat is just so good on it! 5/5Thriller Jill remix-Probably my least favorite remix on here but it's still good. 4/5This single also includes the ultracool So under Pressure video. If you're a Dannii fan, this single is a must!"
5,Perfect for the Ski Patrol OEC Course,"This book is designed to work directly with the OEC course. It is not a stand-alone textbook. It is the perfect OEC study tool, nothing more, nothing less."
4,Useful information but too narrow in focus,"I learned a lot from this book and enjoyed reading it. I believe my writing has improved (or, at least, will improve) from having read this, and I can think of no better compliment for a book about writing.However, it could have been better and may not be for everyone. Mr. Knight is a successful science fiction writer and this experience is evident in much of the book. He seems much more comfortable with genre writing than with the 'literary' short story. For instance, he describes seven different types of plots, most of which seem to work only in mystery stories. Unplotted stories, which seem to be at the heart of modern literary short fiction receives half a page of discussion. Even so, the discussion of viewpoint was excellent and the entire book gave me much to think about."
3,Almost Typical.,"First let me say the author has some excellent advice about using and staying out of the way of your unconscious thought processes. Amen! Brother Knight. Here's a useful analogy: Let's say your brain is your FM radio. The conscious part can deal with one station at a time. The unconscious part deals with all the stations simultaneously. So get-over the idea that you know what's happening. You dont. Otherwise the book is the same stuff contained in every other how-to-write book, and it's written better than many of the others. Something none of the how-to-write books address is taste. Editors and publishers buy what they like, readers buy what they like, and critics give a hooray! to books they like. One man's treasure is another man's trash."
4,A quick read and rich with useful information,"A quick read, Creating Short Fiction explains writing in a strait-forward, easily accesible way. Knight offers very good advice about characterization; he made me realize the importance of characterization when writing fiction. The only weakness is the little attention given to short story writing in particular. However, Knight offers excellent tips for general writing."
4,How to craft a story,"I've been writing non-finction professionally and recreationally for several decades, but fiction was always a bit of a puzzle. I looked at a number of fiction writing guides, but I kept hearing working writers say that THIS was the book that really told you how to write. Damon Knight came out of the great era of fiction writing, a time when there were dozens of popular magazines buying short fiction. There was Colliers, the Saturday Even Post, and of course the Sci-Fi mags like Amazing Stories. Knight is best known as a sci-fi writer, but his lessons apply to any genre. Knight was writing long before the popularity or MFA creative writing programs, and he's not interested in exploring new forms, or extended navel gazing, or challenging the reader's preconceptions, or their patience. He's here to tell you how to tell a story that will interest the reader, and he does that very well."
4,Does the job,"All I wanted was something to hold the phone so I didn't have to carry the phone in my pocket. This does the job well. It is the same unit as the ""Motorola OEM horizontal fashion leather pouch (Black) with ""S"" clip for Motorola MOTO Q"", also advertised here on Amazon."
3,Purchased for Q,Haven't rated this item since I don't use a Q any longer and just forgot to rate any items that I purchased.
3,"The case looks nice, but it does not work well for me","I bought this case after my belt holster broke for my Motorola Q. I really did not like the case that much and ended up buying another holster after a couple of weeks. The case is made well, and I like the look of it, but it was just not for me."
2,It doesn't solve my problem,"If you simply want to not hold your phone in your pocket while having it easily accessible, this is probably a great buy for you. I doubt this is a genuine Motorola product- it feels flimsy on all ends- the clip, the casing and the magnetic closure.I am giving this product a poor rating because it does not addess the reason that I purchased the product- not wanting to accidentily depress the keys. That said, the Motorola has made phantom phone calls while in this case. Time for me to put the lock on the phone so it doesn't make phone calls- but it still won't solve the button depress problem- which wears down the battery unneccessarily."
3,motorola case,The case works well to hold and protect the phone. But the clip is different than the one that was pictured.
4,Does the job.,"Original leather case for Motorola Q phone. Do not expect an extended battery pack on the Q to fit. If you have the extended battery, you might want to look for something a little larger."
5,Does what it is supposed to do!,"I'd prefer a body glove type case but I needed something pronto. Being that I'm a broke college student (lol), this was a good buy for the money I had. It works fine and my phone doesn't fall out of the case. It's very professional as well. Plus, if you go into Sprint, Verizon, or Best Buy to purchase this, it's retailed at $31.99. Talk about a deal."
2,"Fits Q well, magnet is poor.","This case fits the Q with a standard battery well. The magnet is very weak so the cover doesn't stay closed very well. Belt clip is thick so it can handle thick belts. Quality, other than magnet, is good."
5,"Boy, This Is A Good Book!","I mean, how often do you see books having over 25 customer reviews, with only one review less than 4 stars? I have nothing much to add to most of the reviews. The book is very cleanly written so as to be clear, entertaining, and accessible to readers with a range of backgrounds in the area of early church history. Fantastic."
5,Excellent Book,Excellent book which shows how a paganised Church declared Jesus to be God over 300 years after his birth. It is quite obvious that Jesus was a man (a very special man - the Son of God) otherwise the early Christians who were Jews and fiercely monotheistic would not have been converted to Christ.
5,The Imperial Court and the Christian Church,"Beginning with Constantine, the first Christian Emperor, the Christian Church was strongly influenced by its relationship with the Imperial court. This book follows the Nicene and Arian controversy in the Church which lasted for many years. The results of that history are followed through to its final conclusion. Rubenstein has done his research very thoroughly and presents it in a very readable book."
5,The Nature of Jesus,"This is a dramatic history of defining events as they unfolded in the establishment of early Christian doctrine. I once believed that Jesus was 'True God of True God'. Readers of this book will surely appreciate, as I now do, that there were from the beginning other beliefs on the nature of Jesus than those assiduously promoted today by many mainline churches."
1,Historic events are refracted passing thru author's filter.,"Although it is a well-written book by a brilliant author, ""When Jesus Became God"" is simply another exhaustive attempt to avoid the underlying truth in order to ""be right"". Whether Jesus was divine or not, the message and example of Jesus was, and is, an undeniably accurate manifestation of God's love and desire for His people. If Jesus were with us in flesh, he would implore all his Jewish and Christian brothers and sisters to stop the debate and love one another as he loved us.Whether this is said in the past or present tense or ""he"" is capitalized or not is not important. The book never makes this key point, it simply continues the debate. How long will we continue to argue with one another instead of loving and accepting fully? Who will be the first to lay down his stone and forgive? By not picking up this book, you will avoid picking up the stone."
5,A great read!,I think Rubenstein did a superb job. Rubenstein explains the Arian controversy in an understandable and entertaining way. Rubenstein certainly did his research.
2,A breezy take on church history,"From the Acknowledgements page: ""This is a work of storytelling and interpretation"" -- and this is why I really couldn't penetrate the book. My own preference is for more condensed history, not story after story and hundreds of characters. That's my own issue though, not the author's, so others might find this book useful."
5,well done,"For such a potentially dry subject, this was very well done. Read almost like a thriller, very brisk, lively, I definitely felt the author helped you feel the issues, concerns & fears of the day, what impassioned people. A welcome addition to the growing body of information becoming available about the transition of early Jesus followers to the establishment of a state run church."
2,When Jesus Became God: The Struggle to Define Chri...,"Informative but rather dull in it's layout.Kind om mish mash of quotations with very little of the politics surrounding the event, and only focusing on rivalries between two or three bishops."
2,"Actually, no","The Gospels do make it clear that Jesus was divine: Specifically in John ""In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God, and the Word was God, and the Word became flesh"". As well, when Jesus got up on the temple steps and points to himself and says ""Before Abraham was 'I am' (Yhwh--identifies himeself with the four letter name of God). Not surprisingly, this is when the Jews go for the stones. Rubenstein's book tries to wishfully explain away the ""divine"" aspect of Christ but, as with the Arians before him, the attempt will most likely fail."
4,"Biased History lesson, but Good history nonetheless","The author comes from a Jewish perspective, and says that he was beaten for the Jews ""killing Jesus"" when he was a child. That might breed a bit of anger toward Jesus.That said the book was well put together history novel. It read like a fiction work with the flow of the story leaning for you to root for the Arains. I think I could have use some more support for what he said, but found it a good read, and interesting information, though I found the title prejudiced as the author is, he avoids some of the bias and vitriol that is found in the anti-Jesus books and allows very few negative comments to sprinkle in.The traditional orthodox ""believer"" will have a tough time making it through this if he is sensitive, but those with a eye to history and less to orthodoxy will enjoy this book."
3,Braille Watch,"a beautiful watch but, no directions on how to use it..it was given to a 14 year old blind girl and she nor anyone in her visual impaired school or mother could teach her how to use it, set it,read it specifically."
4,I suppose this CD suits my needs for a rockin' time,"This CD was very satisfactory! I am very satisfied with the song, ""I Want To Know What Love Is."" ""Take On Me"" happens to be my favorite song. You see, there is nothing that the 80's cannot cure, and I can truly rock-on to this CD!"
4,revision of Jane,"'The Anatomy of Wood' by K.Wilson & DJB.White is a revision of F.W.Jane's 'The Structure of Wood'. Essentially the latter was the basic British introductory text on wood, long since out of print and a much missed classic. Quite a bit of the contents, especially the very clear diagnostic drawings, survived into 'The Anatomy of Wood'. Unfortunately the printing quality is a bit faint, so that above mentioned drawings lack contrast.N.B. 0 85442 034 7 is the paperback edition."
1,B-O-R-I-N-G!,This book is a complete waste of time....I agree with one of the reviewers that it does not even merit space on my bookshelves! Save your time and money.
3,"Murder on the River Walk has a great setting, an okay plot","The best thing about the mystery is the setting, the San Antonio riverwalk and environs, the descriptions of the Mexican artwork available in the shops there. The plot is a little unbelievable ... the hunters of antiquities and the art collectors are compared to the Spanish conquistadors..."
4,Another well-crafted mystery,"I, once again, enjoyed Carolyn Hart's ability to immerse her reader into the culture and atmosphere of her mystery setting. The descriptions made me want to visit San Antonio and explore the art indigenous to that region. The mystery swept along at a pleasing pace with a surprise twist at the end. Excellent."
2,20th Century Costume Jewelry is Not in My Century,"This book was purchased along with the sister, companion, Brilliant Rhinestones. While I can appreciate the time that the author has devoted to her book (per review on Brilliant Rhinestones obviously by the author's husband) feel that the quality of the photographs is very poor. When I spend money like this on a book, expect jewelry that looks like I want to reach out and pick it up. Many of the darker items are washed out in the background. Felt that the prices were a little overinflated. The concepts for the books are excellent, but this author needs to work on her photography."
1,"Sorry folks, save your money","This book would have benefitted from a lot more research and from inclusion of pieces other than the personal collection of Ms. Aikins and her mother. There are numerous incorrect dates - the most glaring of which consist of labelling aurora borealis pieces as being from the 40's or even 30's when the process didn't exist until about 1953. The descriptions are too ""cutesy"" rather than factual - ex labelling yellow and black pieces ""for Steelers fans"" and elephants ""for Republicans."" Some necklaces are measured by hanging length, others apparently by total length. The list goes on and on. It certainly would be a bad choice for a beginner to rely on, and a more seasoned collector would find it maddening. Give this one a pass."
2,UNHAPPY WITH CONTENT,"PHOTOS ARE VERY NICE IN BOOK BUT TEXT DOES NOT CONTAIN ANY INFORMATION OF ANY VALUE.COMMENTS SUCH AS THIS PIECE IS ADORABLE ,HEAD TURNING NECKLACE ETC.NOT VERY INFORMATIVE DID NOT FIND THIS BOOK TO BE USEFUL."
2,Inexperienced author!,"I have been collecting and selling costume jewelry for over 15 years now. I have over 70 books on the subject and am constantly doing research and learning more. The author doesn't know what Delizza & Elster aka Juliana jewelry is! She has many pieces in her book that she is amazed aren't signed, but doesn't know that they are D&E pieces, one of THE hottest jewelry designers around. Don't bother with her book, there are many more out there that are far better."
3,20th Century Costume Jewelry 1900-1980: Identifaction & Value Guide 2nd Edition,"Lots of very nice color photos. I don't think that the descriptions are very accurate, compared to my other jewelry books this author is not as accurate in estimating the ages of some of the jewelry in this book. I will say that her value estimates seem to be more realistic than most."
1,Bad photos & info!,"After dealing in vintage costume jewelry for over 18 years, I am always looking for more resources. However, this book is very disappointing.... average jewelry with poor picture quality and grossly inflated prices. Using this book for information and guide to values is very misleading. I would be glad to sell the author some of this jewelry for a fraction of her prices! This is a book to pass on, save your money!"
4,,"His Satanic Majesties are back with a symphony of elite hymns that dare to go unnoticed in a scene where a lot of music lacks foundation. Akercocke's latest is a true testimony of competently played Death Metal which is not typical. Akercocke's newest can be Black Metal when it wants to be, adding a few atmospheric eerie parts when appropriate. Akercocke even succeeds at being progressive at times. You can't help but feel mesmerized at the uniqueness of the material. Where others have failed Akercocke effortlessly succeeds when it comes to incorporating clean vocals within barbaric intensity. The difference here is that the clean singing enhances the mood of the song, and the words that go spoken become ceremonial orations instead of weak attempts at clean oral passages. Overall, this band's diversity shines in all fronts, making this release a challenging and compulsive listening experience."
2,robe review,"Not what I was expecting. It felt great but not the finish I was looking for.It was very 'old ladyish"".Good service from this company."
5,Best recording of Mahler's 3rd symphony!,"There are not very numerous live performances of Gustav Mahler's 3rd symphony (even in the big cities) - not only because of its duration and number of needed musicians. When I heard it for the first time I wasn't a real joy for me to listen to it (everything seemed to be just an ""effect"", a little bit superficial), but after studying the score and listening to many recordings of this great opus (Bernstein & NYPO, Solti & CSO, Mehta & LPO) I think that this symphony is one of his best.I bought this CD just a few weeks ago and I have to say that this particuliar CD is simply the best recording avaiable on market. Everything fits together: The fantastic acoustic of ""our"" Musikverein in Vienna (of course I'm a little bit patriotic...) with the VPO (and their so-called ""Wiener Klangstil"", their special way of playing) are just perfect for Mahler's piece. And of course, Claudio Abbado and Jessye Norman do the rest..."
1,Vermont Fan,"Skip this one folks. Its not just bad, its really bad. More than 3/4 of the book is just Giselle and Nigel riding around France avoiding the bad guys they only run into twice anyway. I could have flown to France and jogged to the coast by myself faster than these two and with more excitment fighting off flies. Really, really bad."
3,Wacky Wicker,"Based on the French film ""L'Appartement,"" this American remake might well have been called ""Cleveland"" or ""Detroit"" for as much as it has to do with the Chicago neighborhood from which it takes its title. In fact, most of it was shot in Quebec. That title miscue aside, the plot is intriguing enough and played by an ensemble of young actors who are as attractive as their characters seem as dumb as a box of rocks, Mr. Hartnett in particular. Those who happen to live hard by the elevated tracks in the real Wicker Park may be pleased to think of such glamorous events going on right under their noses. The more skeptical will be annoyed with the confusing flashbacks, the halting dialogue, and the phony settings."
4,Memento meets Closer,"I've walked through my local Blockbuster new release section many times over the last few months, looked at the video box, picked it up, but then the title ""Wicker Park"" and the cheesey artwork would make me put it back on the shelf. Now I find myself writing my first review in two years. Fortunately for me, this movie was on Showtime last Friday night and I finally got to see it. I don't want to describe it with all the details and plots, you can look at other reviews for that, I want to relay the way the movie made me feel. It's a film I knew nothing about and had not seen the trailer, after watching it I was reminded of how I felt after seeing ""Donnie Darko"" for the first time without knowing anything about it. In short, imagine the film ""Closer"" meets ""Memento"". I'm surprised this film hasn't received the cult status of Darko or Memento, it's probably for the same reason I never rented it, poor marketing. My suggestion for a better title is ""Love Again""."
2,Loses steam,"Wicker Park seems to lose it's mysterious overtones after a while, and I stopped caring about any of the characters. There's no real mystery in the whole movie. Hartnet seems out of place as an executive, and Lilard is his normal self. His acting making his characters seems immature."
3,el ciclista,"This movie was a remake from the french movie: L'appartement with Monica Bellucci and Vincent Cassel . If you haven't watched the original, this movie isn't too bad. But as most of the time, the original was much better."
1,Not Recommended!,"There are three main characters and a nebbish . . . one of them is either mad for love or mad, period. In any case, there are just too many coincidences and strange happenings to be believable. Above that the two protagonists are very much mismatched . . one is a beautiful, talented young woman and her love is retiring, tongue-tied and not very attractive very young man.The end is predictable, including the Cinderella-bit with the shoe size. Not recommended . . ."
2,Confusing SLOWLY gives way to Frustrating,"I was so excited to see this movie because of Josh Hartnett but was so disappointed. I thought it was going to be a psycho suspense thriller but I was wrong. It starts off confusing from the beginning and just sprials downward from there getting increasingly frustrating. The actors do a fair job, including Josh but the boring drama of a mentally ill woman just screwing up other people's lives gets in the way. It is not scary or suspensefull at all, it's just boring. The best part was by far Matthew Lillard who threw his little quirky way into an otherwise dead movie. I would not reccomend this movie at all, but if you must- wait till it's on tape!!!"
4,"Held my attention, despite some flaws","I think the acting was good, plot interesting. Only thing that could have been better is that from the time that Matthew loses Lisa to the time he finds clues to where she is is 2 years: but the movie did not really drive that home. Also--too many flash backs."
3,It was ok.....,"""Wicker Park"" (2004)Obession, lies, deceit all things describing ""Wicker Park""The movie started off somewhat confusing as the story is mostly told in flashbacks and memories. It held my interest although the plot is highly predictable.I didn't like the fact that you are anticipating the arrival of a suspensful moment, or some sort of twist and it never comes. They tried to use a little ""twist"" but anyone with half of a brain would know it was coming. The plot almost became aggervating during the last half of the movie.The ending left me quite dissapointed. I wanted more, an explination of smoe sorts I am guessing.The music in ""Wicker Park"" was quite enjoyable which is always a plus. All in all, I believe this movie to be worth a look but don't expect too much."
3,Meh,"I was having a tough time following this film in the beginning, and right before I was about to change the channel, it got interesting. I never really thought there was anything special about Josh Hartnett, but after seeing this film, I changed my mind. I agree with another poster who said he has real potential--he just needs the right roles. Although this movie was mediocre, the vulnerability and desperation of the characters did move me, and I found myself thinking about it for days after I had seen it."
5,Prefer Science Fiction & Action...but this movie gave me insight into someone I know,"I have an engineering background and prefer science fiction and high action movies to stories like Wicker Park. I don't even know what made me buy it, but I did.First and foremost, I have a friend (guy) who is an INFP (if you study Myers Brigg). Anyway, his personal story was so similar to this movie! I'm constantly asking this guy what his problem is, well, some people just believe in love. I just want to say that I now understand my friends point of view about the woman he once knew. I'm not saying I find logic in my friends circumstance...I just understand that situation better.The movie was mysterious and intrigueing and the actors are far more talented than the ones in the most recent remake of ""Pride and Prejudice"", I do suggest ""Wicker Park"".On another note...if you want to see a good version of ""Pride and Prejudice"", get the one with Colin Firth."
1,BORING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I rented this movie because I thought it looked good and didn't want to buy it if it got bad reviews. Anyways this is a very confusing movie it has all these flashbacks and hard to follow. I couldn't stay awake it was so boring. Don't get this you will regret it.
1,BUTT NUMBING DUD OF A DVD,"I really wanted to like WICKER PARK (MGM), but it was almost impossible to follow the non-linear story about a guy (Josh Hartnett) who searches for a lost love (Diane Kruger) and gets tangled up with a love-sick impostor (Rose Byrne). There's a point where the confusing flashbacks and weird edits become so numerous and layered that any residue of good will toward this film simply vanishes.Maybe a look at the French ""L'Appartement"" might be helpful, since this is an attempt at a remake. The trailers wrongly suggest this is an erotic thriller. It is not eritic nor is it remotely thrilling.Remember, time wasted watching bad movies is gone forever..."
2,Storyline sucks. Let's get real.,"This movie would have flown had it been placed in 1975. But in the year 2004, with all the advanced technology, and all of our communication options, it is totally impossible for two lovers to lose complete contact with each other. It is also almost impossible to have your one and only true love still be alive, but mysteriously disappear without a trace, unless she was kidnapped and being held hostage by a wild and dangerous gang of demented psycho baboons (which in that case one would have contacted the missing persons bureau). The couple in this movie are young, well-to-do, modern, cosmopolitan yuppies. Don't tell me they didn't have email, voice-mail, text-messaging, fax or any other way of contacting each other for those two years that they were apart. Total bull.Once you take that into consideration, the movie just becomes pointless. Pure nonsense."
1,Made me want to drop acid.,"Possibly the worst film of the last ten years. Certainly the worst I have seen. When it was over I had to open all the windows (minus 15C here), disinfect my TV, and throw out my DVD player (lucky it wasn't on Blu-Ray!).Ebert and Roeper gave this dog two thumbs up, proving that at least two people in the world are still doing Goofballs, or Mushrooms, or whatever laugh-a-minute cocktail you youngsters are into.The good news is that if you do sit though this stinker, Pearl Harbour will play like a Charlie Kaufman movie."
3,the trailer does this movie a disservice,"The only reason I'm writing this review is because the trailer is misleading, and you may think you are picking up a psycho thriller, when you are really picking up a romantic drama.Let's put it this way, when my wife and I were discussing whether to get it, I was advocating for it, and she was against it. After it was over, she liked it better than I did.From a marketing perspective, I think the promoters did not want this to come out as a chick flick, and they wanted young men to buy into it, but I think that blurred the movie's appeal and confused its audience. It would have done much better if it was targeted more directly and squarely at women 18-35. If you are in this core demographic, you should like this movie. If you are dating someone in this core demographic, you will definitely be able to stand it, and may even enjoy it."
4,Great Movie that keeps you watching.........,"When I first got this movie I thought it was an erotic thriller, but its actually a good thriller. The cast is great especially the chemistry between Josh Hartnett and Diane Kruger.I loved it because the ending is at least a happy one!"
2,A head-scratcher.,"Wicker Park starring Josh Hartnett is one confusing movie. There are too many flashblacks, the plot overlaps in present time, it's just one big passionless mess. Rose Byrne scares me and Diane Kruger needs to take an acting class, overall Wicker Park should have never been released. The only reason I give it two stars is for the location of the film, otherwise than that, skip this one."
3,"Good plot, Hartnett was very good, but missed...","Basically I felt this movie missed its mark.Josh Hartnett was surprisingly good, his acting portraying a young man desperately in love. But it was a dour dark movie and you really had to sit through it to appreciate it. The plot was very intriguing, the ultimate betrayal was moving, but somehow it all didn't work. I have nothing to compare it to, as I never saw the foreign film it was based on.I also didn't like Matthew's treatment of his fiancee and no build-up of that aspect of his life so the viewer never feels he's giving anything up by not going to China."
2,He's wicked Cute - but the movie still sucks!,"OK, she's pretty - he's stinkin' cute - but the movie sucks! the writing, direction, plot, etc. From the blurb on the cover, i was expecting suspence, romance, mystery - and the only mystery was - ""why did i stay up late on a weeknight to watch this?"" my sweet Norman even said it was lame, and he likes most any movie, but, he did fall asleep halfway through, and i had to watch the rest with Norman drooling on my PJ top and the romote in hand, trying to hear over my beloved's snoring...."
1,Watch this DVD!!,Really! Watch it! Watch it!! You can set it on your coffee table and watch it. You can prop it up against the baseboard of your kitchen wall and watch it. You can watch it as it sits on the seat of your car. You can watch it while it floats in a pond. You could also put it into a DVD player and watch it... in any case the effect is the same. A lot of films allow you to stop thinking for a while... this one requires it.
3,Chi-Town,"So I basically went to see this movie because I love Wicker Park, and I was in San Diego when the movie came out and felt like I was representin the CHI!!! Anywho, I actuall enjoyed it a lot, the plot twists and turns. I never would have thought Alex was the sick puppy that she was if the flashbacks had not been included. I liked the who split screen, artsy thing this movie had going. I also like to believe it's romantic when a man becomes obssessed enough with you to ask you out on a date. I don't think it's cool if you have a lovesick nut job for a friend who basically ruins your relationship....I liked this movie enough to buy myself a copy...."
5,IT was a tremendous book/captivating/two thumbs up.,"Its funny to say, my name is Genji Jacques. Yes i am telling the truth, I am not Lying. I am surprised to see my name in the web site, its great. Anyways I just want to say that the book was inspirational and I am sure I will read other novels on my name. Thanks, Genji Jacques"
1,Recommended : Buy charger alone,"Battries are terrible,can't even hold power for one hr , better they can sell charger alone and not instead of this bad bundled offer."
2,"Great charger, bad batteries",The 2 hour charger seems to work very well but the included AA batteries don't hold any charge. I have put them in my digital camera and I am able to turn it on and then it dies. I know it is the batteries because I have other rechargeable s and they work (charged in the rapid charger). Would have been to buy the charger as a stand alone because it would probably be half the price.
1,big dud,Do not purchase these batteries. Several of them in the package will be corroded and will not function. I would have sent them back but it was not worth the shipping hassle.
1,Don't waste your money,"This thing is a waste of money.Everything sucks.The charger will kill the life of your batteries over time. The batteries lose capacity with every charge cycle.I ended up buying theLa Crosse Technology BC-9009 AlphaPower Battery Charger, because the batteries that came with this charger AND my older NiMH kept dying prematurely.The La Crosse brought most of my older batteries back to life after reconditioning. They even rejuvenated the batteries in this package, but still only to about 70% of what the other batteries' capacity.The cost premium for the La Crosse is $25 ($45 - $20). But don't ask yourself if that charger is twice as good as this one. It's a question of getting a GREAT charger versus one that will kill your batteries. The La Crosse isn't twice as good, it's INFINITELY better.BOTTOM LINE: Do NOT waste your money on this charger!"
1,"Bad Batteries, Charger does not hold batteries proper","The batteries are really bad, they don't hold charge for nothing, I can take less than 10 pictures. The charge won't hold the battery properley. poor design."
1,OK charger but awful Batteries,The charger is OK but the included batteries are terrible! They average only 3-4 hours of run time in my GPS unit compared to 16 hours for standard alkaline and 14 hours for my other rechargeable Nimh batteries (name brand and generic). I've even charged them in other chargers but get the same poor results so I can't blame the charger. Wish I just could have bought the charger alone for half the price.
4,B&W for the effort challenged (i.e. 'lazy'),"I recently bought a three pack of this stuff (just for grins) and was pretty impressed by the results (despite my bungling - read on).I had a roll of the stuff loaded and rewound mid-roll as I wanted to shoot some color film (rated at ISO 100). When I loaded the Kodak B&W; back in later, I forgot to reset the ISO back to 400. It wasn't until after I finished the roll that I realized my goof (and a good one at that as I had to deliberately override the DX coding in order to do it). Thinking that I everything was hosed - I just had the lab give me negatives (no proof sheet).I scanned a couple of the images in via a 35mm film scanner and the results were quite usable. This stuff has exposure latitude up the wazoo. I would recommend this stuff to the casual photographer who wants B&W; snapshot - but the latitude makes it useless for the serious amateur thinking this to be an alternative to real B&W;."
5,Some need to know info......,"It is possible to get very nice black and white photos with this film. What you have to know is, don't take it to your average 1 hr. processing lab (walmart, walgreens, cvs). You have to take it to a camera center. Most one hour places can run thousands of rolls of color film thru long before they get to yours and this is what causes the strange pink/purple/mauve/sepia color."
3,Funny Color,"I shot a roll of this film to test how good it worked. When placed next to a conventional process B&W; photo. I drew 2 conclusions. The kodak B&W; has a finer grain, yet was magenta tinted, sometimes HEAVLY, to the point of being pink. Also, the high contrast you get with conventional B&W; was not apparent. It looked like someone hit grayscale in photoshop.If you want really good B&W; from a C41 film, I'd try Kodak TMAX T400CN."
3,watch who develops it...,"I This is good film if you just want to toy around with B&W, but I wouldn't recommend it for any Professional style photography."
3,Nice product but too pricey,It is unlikely that I will purchase this product again as the cost was to expensive for only 3 rolls of film.
1,Do not buy this CD,Don't waste your money. This CD doesn't feature the actual artists. It's a big waste of cash - you're better off putting an ice-pick in your eye
3,Amon Duul II - 'Kobe (Reconstruction)' - Captain Trip import,"A benefit CD release to help the victims of an earthquake that caused some heavy damage in Kobe, Japan. Been out for awhile now. Just one lengthy 65-minute track here that's apparently been given a studio re-working of several vintage AD II cuts, ""Hallimasch"", ""Kupplungen"" and the cosmic ""Kronwinkel"" that appeared on the U.S. release 'AU Years'. Not a bad disc. Mainly aimed toward either AD II completists, collectors or just krautrock fans (like myself) that enjoy odd titles such as this."
2,very disappointed with hippo head,"looked good out of the box,but after putting weights on it and putting it in the pond it leans to one side and is like a bobble head!! paint is peeling real bad after omly one week. very disappointed with this, i would return it, but after putting so many holes in the bottom trying to stop it from leaning they probably would not accept back.. waste of money and the shipping was almost the same price as the item itself.. trying to make extra money off us.."
3,hippo open mouth,hippo is ok . the head could be broader. i think it's a shame that you charge over half the price to ship it.
3,Horses of the World coloring book,"My 6 year old daughter loves horses and was thrilled with thisbook. She said ""because the horses are so real looking and they have great detail."" This book also teaches a little about each breed that is focused on in the drawing. My daughter said "" Realistic animals in coloring books are very important to us."" meaning children in general. I am very pleased with this book the detail in the drawings are incredibly accurate to the breed, and I have been working with horses for over 20 years. Thankyou so much for such a great coloring book one without cartoon characters. Sincerely, Eileen"
4,Worth the price,I bought this for $30 and its worth every penny. Can't expect more for the money. Definitely not worth more that $50.
3,"All things being equal, the violin effects need to go!","I purchased this CD because of the song ""Raquel"" which is on the soundtrack for the movie ""Hable Con Elle"". This song (Raquel) is an amazingly simple but memorable piece with a soft/funky latin beat keeping the time rolling right along. When putting in this CD, ""Raquel"" was the first song, so I was quite happy. And then I got to the second song and that weird screechy violin started in.. ugh.. with all due respect to Bau, the way he distorts/effects the violin is not enjoyable. At all. I bought the CD for his amazing guitar work. Now, in that respect the album is fantastic, but I want to just skip past every song that contains the violin - due to the effects. And unfortunately, most songs contain it (there are like 4-5 that don't). Overall, great musician, unfortunate choice of effects."
1,The most horrible Martial Arts book ever written,"This book had totally false misconceptions of the Martial Arts, the author has no real credentials except for the ones he made up, and The techniques are demonstrated and illustrated wrong."
1,Horrible Book,This book holds no knowledge and the stories have no realtionship to the arts at all. Very poorly written
5,Great Movies,I love all these movies in the series. I have the 1st two volumes. I will end up buying all the movies in this series. A great gift to buy for someone also.
2,Not 22 AWG Solid Copper Wire,The product is probably fine as a 100 foot phone cable but I actually bought it for the wire inside. The wire inside is not 22 AWG solid copper wire as it said in the description. The wire inside is 22 AWG stranded copper wire. I needed solid copper wire.
5,The Soul of Wit: Little Book Brings play Back to Language,"too often in teaching or learning ""rules"" of writing people forget that language, in its double meanings, in its sound, pad plays on words in like a school yard game of the Dozens played by Mensa members. This book revels in the various ways language is play and encourages readers to skim though and enjoy select passages just for their love of language. This book makes a more delightful approach to language primary and leaves readers with the pleasure of looking at the fun of words. A great gift for all readers, punsters, and etymologists. For poets, essayists, and lyricists. For all those in your life who make words their vocation and avocation. A delight."
3,"It's ok, but greatest hits is better",This album offers a different kind of Harry. The CD was not quite my taste in what he offers.
3,A Chapin album of a different flavor,"Having worshipped Harry since I was nine years old, it pains me to say anything negative of the master storyteller. ""Living Room Suite"" is the only Chapin album released during his lifetime that I would rate anything less than excellent. It has a little different feel than his other albums. It is somber and laid back with a slight country feel and little dramatics. It's hard to get emotionally involved with this album in the way that his other albums inspired. ""Flowers are Red"" is the only stand-out story song, but ""Dancin' Boy"" is a great tribute to parenthood that always brings a crack to my voice. This was the only Chapin CD my brother liked because it ""was more normal"". I disagree. Chapin was the master and this disc only rates less than 'excellent' when compared against other Chapin work."
3,Not what I expected,The panties were huge. They were supposed to be size 5 but they were more like size 7. I called the company and talked to a customer service person. They gave me instructions on returning the product. I followed their directions and returned the item and I have not heard back. When I called to see when I could expect shipment they told me they hadn't received the items back. It has been over 10 days and I haven't received anything. Still waiting!!!!
5,It's ALIVE!!!!,"I am no music expert, but the kind of passion that Bernstein draws here from the Vienna PO and from his singers, in particular Gwyneth Jones, does not depend on expertise for recognition. In addition, the recording is very good.If I were to recommend one of the versions I know of this work to a classical music neophyte, this is the one I would choose."
4,Paul Sebastian Kinetic,"Product was received in the time specified and was exactly as expected. It was my first time trying the Kinetic but have used the regular Paul Sebastian for many years. The Kinetic had a good scent but did not last half as long as the regular scent and was not noticed by anyone. Usually everytime I wear the PS regular cologne someone always asks what cologne I am wearing that smells so good, even some men have asked. I will continue to use the regular scent."
2,POOR PACKAGING!!!!,"I searched every where and finally I found my dad's favorite hard to fine Kinetic by Paul Sebastian. I receivedthe package, it said new and I was disappointed how it came in! It came in a mail in a small plastic mail bag andin the bag the cologne was packed in a thin white box. The cologne had no lid and it was spray top was NOT screwedon tightly, so it leaked out and soaked the box. The bottle was only 3/4 full after leakage. I didn't return itbecause my fathers birthday was the next day and I promised him that I'll find another bottle. This is not normalto receive that kind of packaging from Amazon, but I guess I should blame the company that told Amazon that is wasnew!"
2,Slippery Shower Shoes,I ordered these shower shoes because I had recently had surgery and wanted to be sure I didn't slip. These slippers are slicker than the tiles. If that's why you are buying --- don't!
2,Wanted it to work.,"These are comfy - they protect your feet in the shower - and are completely impractical for travel.They never dry out! When you're traveling and using these shoes for communal showers - you need material that dries quickly. I even held them under hand driers and blow dryers when available (often for a long time) and squeezed them in towels to no avail. They were still soaking wet. Packing a pair of wet shoes that stay wet is just a breeding ground for bacteria and general grossness.Get a cheap $2 pair of foam flip flops - they'll do the job, dry fast enough and are cheap enough to toss when the travels are over."
5,Just what I hoped for,"I didn't get these for the shower. I got them to walk around the house in. Don't care for the socks with dots or whatever on the bottom. I still walked holes in them. Didn't want bulky slippers. This was the perfect ""in between"" that I was looking for. Plus now I can use them when I go thru the airport security without getting my regular socks filthy. Especially helpful when you are running late for a flight and don't have time to stop to put your shoes back on. Also, unlike slippers they take up no room at all. Perfect for travel."
2,Not Really An Ellery Queen,"This is a novelization of an Ellery Queen movie starring Ralph Bellamy. ""Ellery Queen"" (Dannay & Lee) didn't write it-- I don't know who did. It's a weak novel and not worth reading unless nothing else is available.The ""real"" Ellery Queens, especially the first dozen or so, are still good fun (if you can't get your hands on a Nero Wolfe)."
3,Full stop on 16mm Auto focus problem,"I purchased this lens last month after reading all the positive reviews about it.But i am facing a problem with the auto focus, When my lens is set to 16mm my K20d can't focus at the object even if i switched the focusing to spot.I have to bring the lens into the manual focus so that i can make it right.Did any one out there faced the same problem?Beside that I love the picture quality but not the build.... :(I was surprised that the lens is made in Vietnam and not Japan..... all my previous lenses are made in Japan, so why Pentax went cheep on the building quality?"
4,Pentax Zoom,A very good lens / performs well. A reasonably priced zoom lens that performs well. There are better lenses for double or trple the price. but for the price you can't beat it.
5,Re: Not made in USA,"The first reviewer was obviously unaware that ALL Frontline has ALWAYS been made in France. It is packaged differently for different countries. The product to be sent to the US will have the EPA Reg. number on it. That is what you need to look for if you want ""US Product"" I hope this helps. Francie at FleaSmart dot com"
4,great thriller,A very hard to find movie but worth the effort.Kevin Dillon was wonderfully creepy as a man with no conscience who will stop at nothing to claim what he believes belongs to him. Lysette Anthony and Nick Mancuso are wonderful as a couple who unfortunately become entangled with him by no choice of their own. A great little thriller for a Saturday night.
3,An earlier effort by Dianne Pearson,"Bride of Tancred was not my favorite .. too dark and moody, I thought. I highly recommend Csardas; and Summer of the Barshinskys; and the last one ... Voices of Summer ..... and in that order."
5,Superb in it's class..,"Takes 3.3 pixel. The one thing I like about this digi cam, the ordinary 35mm film can be reproduce to digital quality using the included software and accessories that came with this cameraAnd I got it for under $500!! no kidding.."
5,"Great, but under-appreciated album","I bought this album a few years ago, and I'm finally getting around to review it. After hearing her on the Lilith Fair collection, I bought 2 albums by Tara MacLean, which were excellent, and I was wondering when she would make another one. Then I found out she made this collaboration with Damhnait Doyle and Kim Stockwood, whose work I was not familiar with. I was very pleased with this album. The three women work well together, harmonizing and soloing. The album blends and highlights their individual styles: Damhnait's bluesy rock, Kim's warm pop-country, and Tara's pure soaring folk voice. This album is a fine collection of quality folk, rock, and pop songs with excellent performances by 3 highly talented professionals. Why Tara and the group have not had more success in the US is a mystery to me, kind of like the Corrs."
3,eh...not as good as I thought...,"After hearing Tara MacLean had formed a new supergroup with Kim Stockwood and Damhnait Doyle, I couldn't WAIT to hear their sound since I have been a big Tara fan for years. After hearing the single 'Happy Baby', I rushed out and bought the CD. I was pretty disappointed. Tara's vocals are not focused on, she hardly has any lead and when she does you can hardly tell it's her. Stockwood seems to take over most of the lead vocals yet she has the worst voice out of them all. I found the second bonus disc better with amazing tracks from Damhnait and 2 good tracks by Stockwood. A more country rock pop direction than all 3 of them as singles but still OK. Best songs are the cover of Sinead Lohan's 'No Mermaid' and 'Geunivere'."
3,A little short,"I installed this in my kitchen along with a Kohler Simplice faucet, on the opposite rear corner of my D-shaped sink.It's a nice complement to the Simplice shape.While I am happy with the purchase, I have two small things to mention. The soap reservoir is huge. With my deep sink, I had to cut a slot in the back of the cabinet to accommodate the tank. No big deal, but it was something else I had to pay my contractor to do.The second thing is that the spout is not very long, so the soap drips a bit onto the granite counter between the dispenser and the sink. Perhaps I should have had the counter hole put a little closer to the edge of the sink, but then the reservoir may have run up against the sink itself. It would have been nicer if the dispenser had a slightly longer spout."
2,"Nice, but could be more durable","This is a beautiful soap dispenser that looks really good on any countertop, especially with the matching faucet. It is very heavy and appears to be sturdy. However, after only a few years of use, the spout broke right off. We tried jamming it back in the hole, but it did not stay. Kind of expensive for a soap dispenser that only lasts a few years. :("
3,"Easy Install, Slow to Fill, & Not Much Comes Out!","This dispenser is easy to install, and it's nice that you can fill it from the top, but you've got to feed the soap in slowly or it backs up and creates a mess! The amount of soap that comes out is a bit less that I expected - and it doesn't come out the very end like you'd expect. The dispensing hole is actually about 3/16ths back from the end of the small ""arm""... The packaging is that abominable plastic that's designed to deter thieves, so be prepared!"
1,THIS COMPANY IS THE WORST,Twice I ordered a gold tone soap dispenser and twice I was shipped a brushed silver one. Money out and money in. This company needs to straighten out its ordering system and not make it so much work for the consumer to order the correct item and keep track of the charges and credits. P.I.T.A.
3,Nice But Ugly Stainless Color,"This Kohler-VS soap dispenser is great in that it is a nice tight fit, holds 16 ounces and can be filled from the top. Everything you would want in a dispener. However, I purchased the Kohler-VS (Vibrant Stainless) and it does not match my stainless faucet. It is not vibrant or shiny like I would have thought. It is a dull stainless. I should have sent it back but decided to try to learn to live with it. Not happening. I see me puchasing another later because it does not go well in my new kitchen. Probably should have tried the chrome."
2,Spout fell off,"Worked OK for a year or so and then the spout fell off. It's not threaded or anything so we can't repair it. The spring also isn't really strong so it has trouble returning the piston to the ""up"" position sometimes. I'm not spending 50 bucks for another spout-launching soap dispenser."
5,delicious,"Like all the Total Soy products, it tastes great and easily mixes with the liquid (I use water). I made the mistake of buying a different brand because it was on sale, and got stuck with 4 pounds of nasty tasting, clumpy protein powder. Mixing it 1:1 with this has completely covered the bad taste and also helps it mix with water. Not only does this stuff taste and mix great, it can fix your other protein powders, too!"
5,Love It!,"I've been drinking this for years. I have tried many other nutritious drinks/shakes. This tastes delicious - no chalky, vitamin taste. The strawberry flavor is refreshing and not too sweet. It has a good balance of vitamins and minerals. The only downside is that it is low in fiber. But I add a fiber supplement with flax seed to it. I notice a difference in how I feel when I drink it regularly. Would highly recommend it!"
4,Amber Brown Is Feeling Blue,"In the story, Amber Brown is feeling blue, written by Paula Danziger is about a girl named Amber whose parents are divorced and for Thanksgiving, her Mom wants to take her to Walla Walla, Washington but her Dad wants to take her to New York. She doesn't want to choose - but her parents are leaving it up to her. To make things worse, Amber Brown isn't the only one in school with a colorful name anymore. Kelly Green is the new girl in her class...Amber ends up showing Kelly around the school and they become best friends.My favorite part in the book is when Kelly sees another student throwing up so she ended up throwing up too.I chose this book because it is about a girl my age and I wanted to learn about her life and how it compares to mine."
5,Amber Brown,"The book Amber Brown is Feeling Blue is a great book. It is about a girl Amber Brown whose parents had been divorced for a long time. When she went to school, Amber Brown met a girl named Kelly Green. At first, Amber Brown did not like Kelly Green, but after a while Amber Brown started to like her.My favorite part of the book was when they had a sleepover. At the sleepover they were painting their nails and they got nail polish on the rug. They thought that her mom was going to kill them. Then she finally got the nail polish out with nail polish remover. The part of the book that I didn't like was when Amber Brown found out that she was going to Walla Walla, and she could not see her dad when he was going to come. That's really sad. The book was also very funny. I love Amber Brown books and I will read more until I have read them all."
5,One book to read more than once,"One of the finest and loving explanations of what the real truth is about the history and life of this amazing, over 2000 year old Catholic Church.gmcmaster"
1,An excellent reason for NOT buying this book...,"Here's a little excerpt from the book talking about communion:""When the priest announces the tremendous words of consecration, he reaches up into the heavens, brings Christ down from His throne, and places Him upon our altar to be offered up again as the Victim for the sins of man. It is a power greater than that of Seraphim and Cherubim. The priest brings Christ down from heaven, and renders Him presenton our altar as the eternal Victim for the sins of man, not once but a thousand times! The priest speaks and lo! Christ, the eternal and omnipotent God, bows His head in humble obedience to the priest's command.""I ask you, ""Who is more powerful, a priest or God?"" Don't buy this book. Instead go here: ... and buy Preparing Catholics for Eternity. This book will change your life."
5,amazing,"This album has gone beyond the limits of fantastic....I mean, I am no critique, and am no good at it, but this album is amazing....full of great lyrics, and amazing drumbeats, and guitar riffs......these guys are going places!!"
4,nice chair pads!!,The price was right....nice chair pads. The color is a great shade of sage. They arrived quickly.
4,Nothing Special,They hold there shape pretty well but there could be more padding. You get what you pay for I guess.
5,How to Stay in London for Less,"I loved this book! Without it I couldn't think about going to London. I'm an artist, and it has places even I can afford ($550 a week for my own apartment in central London). The photos let me get the feel of the less expensive flats and see if they are right for me.This is just the way I like to travel. Stop in one spot, unpack, settle in, get to know the nieghborhood, and meet people. I can make my own meals and save money. The authors' ratings are objective. I know what I'm getting and don't have to worry that it won't be as described.And it doesn't have only inexpensive places. It has the whole range of apartments from my price range to super-luxury. Fun to think about.Apartment stays are the way to go. This book is for anyone who wants to spend more than two days in London and get to know the neighborhood."
3,"Great Book, but needs to be UPDATED!","This is an excellent book, but some of these buildings are going by different names or have been sold since publication. There are many newcomers with beautifully designed serviced apartments that are not included in this book. My wife and I just spent 2 weeks at 49 Lancaster Gate which was an unforgettable, luxurious and affordable experience. They have a great website which really got our attention. There apartments are even better when you stay in them. Ours had a huge marble bathroom and jacuzzi bath and was very well equipped. The location was could not have been more perfect. We have also stayed at Mayfair House which was wonderful and 130 Queensgate which was smelly (our flat stank of cigarette smoke on arrival) and very badly furnished. Stay away from 130 Queensgate. Another excellent building is Somerset Bayswater, although Lancaster Gate is our favorite by far."
3,Not bad for a remake,"While the purists should avoid this one due to the non-original cuts (but all original artists), it's still a good deal for some sing-along or karioka fun. Pretend you're back in high school at a sock hop - we never seemed to worry then that the local groups didn't sound exactly like the originals. Most tracks are OK and adding some reverb goes a long way."
3,"Good Compilation of Oldies, But...","You're probably looking at the endless list of 60s hits right now thinking ""WOW -- lots of great songs!"". They really are. No doubt about that. I guess I was expecting better sound quality recordings (even for oldies) in a boxed set like this, but many of the tracks turned out sounding very monotone-ish. In addition, I think the marketing gurus at Madacy Entertainment Group weren't thinking for the end-user as much as they were for marketing strategies. With the impressive total of 8 CDs, it's a lot of songs, but for me, it's a bit of a hassle having to change CDs after every 12 songs (few tracks compared to what could have been taken to 20 tracks on 5 CDs).So... if you're looking for lots of great songs of yesteryear, don't care much about sound quality, and are lucky enough to have a CD changer, get this. Otherwise, save your money and find another boxed set."
3,runs about 2 sizes small,my wife loved the shirt but this thing runs so damn small we had to send it back. She'd probably need a large and they did not have any in stock. So please be warned when sizing this item.
5,My Dad loves this,"I bought this atlas for my dad several years ago. He loves it! He enjoys looking up cities and areas he reads about in the news, and the atlas is well-organized, attractive, current and easy to follow."
5,Great Value!,"I purchased the Keson RR318N measuring wheel for a fraction of the cost of similar wheels - most 3-foot wheels start around $90. I couldn't be happier with the wheel. The stand is a convenient feature, allowing me to stop mid-measurement to take notes in the field. The wheel is well-constructed and rolls smoothly over even rough surfaces. I highly recommend this product."
5,"Does the job, fun to use","So far, I've used this product to see how far I'm running at the local park, and it seems extremely accurate and durable. The kickstand is a great feature, and I love how the counter will decrease as I move the wheel backward. Measures precisely in one-inch increments. Wheel is sturdy, and handle is adjustable. Good product."
4,Does the job well,"This measuring wheel works better than others I've used with smaller wheels. It seems to be very accurate. And it is easy to roll over whatever terrain and not worry about the wheel getting caught or not turning.What I might say are downsides, the wheel moves so freely that if you pick it up for whatever reason the wheel will continue to spin and therefore measure. Seems silly but its almost like it needs a ""brake"". You can push down the counter with your foot to reset, but its easier to do with your hand. But if you bring the wheel to you as opposed to bending over, you have to be careful that the wheel doesn't spin when you are setting it down. Counter is easy enough to read, but would be even better if the numbers were bigger. And kickstand works somewhat ok but really needs to be on a flat surface or it will still fall over.Overall its a good purchase."
4,RoadRunner,"Excellent product, not highest end, but what I expected and does the job.I purchased it from the Amazon warehouse, I presume it was a returned item. I was concerned about the condition it was described ""like new"" and I was pleasantly surprised that it in fact looks and works as if it is new."
5,Great Wheel,This product does what I expected it to do. So far it has held up quite nicely. Price and delivery time were great.
4,Keson RoadRunner Measuring Wheel,"I received the wheel as promised and was able to use it immediately. It is a very pratical tool for measuring long lenghts, is quite accurate and easy to use."
4,Saves a lot of time!!!,I'm in the landscaping business and do a lot of measuring. It's so important to get the sq. ft right when using fertilizers. I could say using this product helped my business a hundred-fold. Would I recommend this RoadRunner Measuring wheel? YES for sure.
5,Measuring Wheel Works Well,Have used this measuring wheel several times now and it works well. The distance seems to be pretty accurate as I have checked it a few times.
1,Non measuring wheel,"Totally dissatisfied with this measuring wheel. I bought this back in Sept. when I received the measuring wheel it was DOA. Contacted Amazon who immediately issued a replacement. After receiving the new wheel I only used it a couple of times before storing for off season. Got it out recently and have problems with it on my jobs, seven times out of ten the counter will not count after a reset. Not certain if wheel even measures accurately with these counter issues. The quality of this measuring wheel is sub standard compared to other measuring wheels I have owned and used."
1,Inacurate,"Recently purchased 7 of these wheels. After a couple of weeks several of these are no longer accurate. One of the most inaccurate loses 2 feet for every 60 feet measured. This inaccuracy caused over a day and a half of paperwork to fix. If you own one of these, I recommend you check it against a tape measure."
1,Stop working 1/2way through the first job,I bought this to set up a floor plan and I didn't get half way finished before it wouldn't zero out. Please don't purchase this if you want to measure more than a couple of times. Really frustrated.
4,Nice for the Price,"I purchased some land and needed a measuring device like this to get a rough idea of the where buildings should go on the land and how much space they would take up. Devices in the home store were too expensive. This item does a great job. The wire guide can get in the way, you can take it off if you don't like it. I found it annoying when measuring over rough ground. Other than that, its a keeper."
2,Looked good but...,"The thing worked great for a while. But if you are going to use it where dust is (a farm, etc), after a short time the counter reset becomes hard to reset to zero. Disappointing."
1,Broken too early,"I use this to measure land, buildings & bins. I have used it twice on the second time it was broke so I had to roll the wheel around to get it to zero. I travel long distances and can't have equipment failure. I needed this for occasional use. I took it apart and it was just broke."
4,Helpful when measuring un-climbable roof slopes,"I measure roof tops for a living and sometimes there are roofs that are just too steep to climb. When I cannot climb a roof to measure, it is extremely helpful to have the Keson RoadRunner with me. It's easy to use and it also helps me to quickly measure fences[...]"
3,Bland,"I thought it was very bland tasting and added some spices and a little sour cream to perk it up. Due to Wolfgang's reputation, I was surprised I had to add anything to it. The only reason I would buy it again is that I have not found another organic mushroom soup and I'm too time constrained to make my own. Also I applaud this company for having coventional and organic soups at the same price point."
2,Disappointing,"Mushroom soup is one of my favorites, so I was very disappointed in this version. I agree totally with the first reviewer - This is one bland and tasteless soup. I'm only giving it any stars at all because it is organic and the attempt is appreciated."
4,Not bad,"For those of you who like mushroom soup, this soup is actually good. The only problem is that the butter overwhelmes the mushroom taste. If the company cut back on the butter, it would be a 5-star soup."
1,Fell Apart,"I read reviews for this item and they were positive so I gave it a shot. When I received it I thought it looked okay, was pretty and sturdy. I put it out and the birds seemed to like it. Two days later it had fallen apart! The top had completely fallen off. It looked like the glue just disintegrated. It is now a piece of junk. ""Not suitable for outdoor use"" is what it should say."
3,very pretty....quality is a bit lacking,"I bought this for my mother for her birthday. It is a beautiful feeder with the stained glass and all, but the wood is not protected at all for the outdoors. We bought some stain and protective spray and it is doing fine now. The only other issue was that one of the corners on the bottom started to come apart, but I cannot say whether that was a manufacturing issue or the fact that we have a chipmunk who likes to jump onto the bird feeder and its weight could have done it. I just put a bit of superglue on it and it's just like new."
1,Stained Glass Bird Feeded,"Dont waste your money. The top fell apart first time it rained. I built a new on for that, and now the rest is falling apart. Just by some stained glass and build your own."
4,Well written romance,"If you are interested in a good romance with wonderful sexual incounters (ones that are not compeletly written and told to you, but ones that can leave you writing the rest in your own head), then take the time to get and read this book. For me this is one to keep, one to have on hand for a warm-hearted tale of two people finding each other and love. After knowing each other as kids, growing up, growing apart and just when the heroine needs to find and get a husband out of thin air he has returned to town twenty some odd years after leaving it."
3,Ok except Liner lock,"I got this from Amazon. Good price and fast delivery. This knife is sharp and strong. But when I flip open it too hard, the liner lock goes all the way and get stuck at the other end of the blade tail. It's so tight and almost hurt my finger nail. I have to use a tool to hammer it out every time. Adjusting the screw can help to keep the liner lock at the right position. But when the screw loosen, it'll happen again. Other than that, it's really a good knife."
4,Excellent Value,"For the price, this is a great knife. It's not of the highest quality, but it's definitely well made. Very sturdy construction and the blade keeps an edge pretty well."
5,A very good interpretation,"These two gentlemen really had a good thing going on when they recorded this album. Take an evening, put it on, turn down the lights, sit down and hear them play wonderfully, enjoying themselves as they play for us. It is a very good introduction ot the cello sonata of Brahms, specially if you do not know them previously. Recommended."
3,"Good, but not great.","While this recording is performed well, after listening to Jacqueline Dupré's rendition of this piece it is hard to rate this performance with the full five stars. Dupré takes the music to another level with even richer tones and smoother legatos. Another difference when comparing these two recordings is the coordination between the cellist and the accompanist. Dupré played with her husband, the pianist and conductor Daniel Barenboim. Those two connect at a much deeper level than the pair in Rostropovich's recording, who at times are clearly not together. However, this review is by no means intended as an affront on Rostropovich's clearly masterful abilities as a cellist. It is just that in the comparison of the two recordings, I feel that Ms. Dupré's passionate and more liberal style of play better suits this particular piece."
2,A bit noisy but still enjoyable,"While I certainly enjoy the music-making of these two marvelous artists, there is discernable human noise in this recording. Sometimes this happens in particularly emotional or challenging passages. I'm still glad I have it, however, as it makes the performance real and alive even if a bit distracting."
2,made in china,"I bought this stand on amazon after checking the reviews.got it 3 days later.And had it assembled in about 30minutes,so that was easy.but the frame is crooked and where the ""V"" shaped brackets are welded on to the axle shaft. The brackets dont line up properly.So once the tubes where attached the welded brackets had to be rebent the stand still sits a little crooked.and it makes the motor pull to one side"
3,A GREAT CIMFORTER SET,"This is a beautiful comforter set, especialy the piping trim & the fringe on the bed skirt. It is easy to pick a thread but i still love it."
1,Poor Quality for The Price!,"14k Yellow Gold Multi-Gemstone NecklaceI was initially excited to receive this product. I thought I would receive something feminine and dainty. The whole product (chain and ""gems"") were of poor quality. The chain specifically was more like 15"" (the size and quality you would give a little girl) and the ""gems"" were nothing more than cheap plastic! Nothing at all like the photo.Frankly, I am shocked that Amazon would sell something of obvious poor workmanship. It makes me hesitant to purchase any more jewelry from Amazon."
4,"""Must I dream and always see your face....""","It only contains 3 tracks but it's well worth the money spent; after all--it's quality, not quantity! ""Kanga Roo"" is an epic cover and I suggest that if you thoroughly enjoy this version, track down the original by Big Star (from ""Third/Sister Lovers""). Alex Chilton and Buckley are woven from the same emotional thread and their musics are very similar in melody and content. This is one of Jeff's finer excursions into the realm of experimental and ethereal sound. Yet another side to brilliant polygon of immeasurable shape and definition."
3,Love it as a stuffed animal! .,The pouch is way to small to really use as a backpack (fits an item perhaps the size of a baseball) but my daughter loves it just the same. Works well as a stuffed animal.
1,Only Lasted one year,I purchased this camera exactly one year ago last week and the LCD screen went out. I called the local JVC repair and was told that it would be around 400.00 to repair(way not worth it). The pictures were decent while it lasted but I did not like the design and it was difficult to use.
1,There are better designs available...,"This was our first digital camera and we were excited to unpack it on Christmas morning, but never warmed up to this one. It has a nice feel and theoretically, a nice design, but many of the features didn't match the documentation and didn't work the way they were supposed to, until three months later, the entire system just died. Fortunately, we purchased the camera from Dillards.com, and their excellent customer service allowed us to return the camera for a full refund, but we won't replace it with another JVC. The camera has some nutty little quirks, such as a warning not to turn the camera on with the lens cap on the lens, or you'll risk serious damage to the lens mechanism. Sounds like a definite design flaw, doesn't it? JVC makes great audio equipment, but buy your camera from a manufacturer known for cameras! Good luck!"
1,Just In Time,I was a couple of clicks away from ordering this set before I read the previous review. I cannot accept re-recording; but I can accept re-mastering. I want the real music.
1,Liars,"Besides being a skimpy amount of music per CD, average of around 30-35 minutes, these aren't always the original artists. For instance, Berry Gordy wrote ""Do You Love Me"" and The Contours, a Motown group, recorded it first, not the Brian Poole & The Tremeloes."
5,Many reasons to own this excellent CD,"If you remember A-ha fondly from your youth, grab this disc. If you like pleasant, atmospheric electronic pop music, grab this disc. If you appreciate talented male vocalists, grab this disc. There are many reasons to add ""Hunting High and Low"" to your music collection.A bit oddly, I suppose, ""Take On Me"" was never a song I liked, even if I thought the video was excellent. ""Hunting High and Low"" was my favorite back in those old days. And it's still a great piece of pop music, in my opinion.However, ""Living A Boy's Adventure Tale"" and ""The Sun Always Shines On TV"" are fantastic song. ""The Sun..."" in particular is worth a listen.The rest of the tracks on the disc are also highly entertaining, with none of them feeling like ""filler"" to me."
3,Not bad for a first try,"Don't the opening beats of ""Take On Me"" get you every time? I know it did me. This album is quite listenable from start to finish with nary a lagging moment. The way it seems, ""Take On Me"" is a pop disguise to something far more literate. What we have here isn't just your stupid kiddie pop of modern day. These songs were well crafted (by the group) and well executed (by the group). The low point however is a bit of the over-riding poppiness which I suppose is a matter of taste. High points: TAKE ON ME (of course), HUNTING HIGH & LOW, THE BLUE SKY and HERE I STAND AND FACE THE RAIN."
3,Good Songs And Production,"A-ha has never been one of my favorite groups, but there's no doubt that they can write some good songs. They sort of remind me of Duran Duran a little bit, not completely though. Highlights of Hunting High and Low are ""Take on Me,"" ""Living a Boy's Adventure Tale,"" and ""Love is Reason."" I really give this album three-and-a-half stars instead of three, but you aren't allowed to grade on a half. Good synth-based music with better than average songwriting and a good production."
3,...for a place in America,"You know how the story goes. Obscure European band labors in obscurity for years. Somehow, through sheer chance, has one track (which may or may not be typical of their work) hit it stateside and rocket up the charts. Make them megastars, a household name...until their one hit dies out and they never come close to striking gold again.Yes, before Aqua, there was the strangely similar-sounding A-ha, and this was an otherwise perfectly ordinary album where their one shining star (which I always suspected became popular mainly due to the unbelievable range on the chorus part) came from.Not much else to say. Typical, ordinary synthpop, what I'd call ""waiting room music"". The singer, despite his best efforts, has some trouble with the English language. I've heard a lot worse, but it's no surprise why A-ha never could find its niche here."
2,So cheesy that it hides the true quality of the band.,"A-HA is much better than some people think. This debut is very good, but suffered from two major flaws: the indecent, excessive exposing of TAKE ON ME, an amazing tune totally burned out by massive MTV and radio playing, and the slicky and acheesy production.Even being totally synth-orientated, the album could have possessed more edge to its approach, because the songs are essentially very good and melodic. There was no need to such a openly commercial production."
4,Brilliant...,"This and the follow-up,Scoundrel Days,are as close to perfect pop as is humanly possible.Although Scoundrel Days edges it for me,this is still a tremendous LP and if you have one then you must have the other - they go hand in hand.Stay on these Roads,the third album is also a necessity.After that,the goalposts moved and the band took-on a totally different sound.You may like it but it's not to be confused with the first three LP's - BUY THEM!!!"
2,Beware people!,"Beware people! They have trimmed the extended version of ""Sun Always Shines On TV"" for this double CD reissue. They've cut the start off what used to be a wonderfully epic 12"". It used to 8.25 long - it now begins with a poorly executed fade in. Very sad. And what about the 12"" on Take On Me? Why would you leave it off this reissue? Stupid really.Good news is both these 12"" are available in their original glory on the Retro:Active series. Take On Me is available on Volume 1Rare & Remixed, The Sun Always Shines... is on Volume 2Retro Active Rare & Remixed 2. These CDs are getting a bit scarse, so happy hunting high & low!"
4,Where it all started,This is a great CD. Even back then they were ahead of their time. Great songs on this one. Made me love the band's music. I've been hooked for over 20 years!
3,more than just a one-hit wonder,"Hunting High and Low is a strong debut for this trio from Norway. ""Take On Me"" is included on most compilation CDs for the 1980s so it is tempting to breeze over the first track due to oversaturation. however it is a nearly perfect opener as it sets the tone for the rest of the songs. each is well-crafted, pure pop: that Pa(u)l Wakataar took the time to write thoughtful lyrics is more of a reminder that what passes for ""pop"" today is merely a slick package made by faceless producers. songs such as ""Train of Thought"" and ""Living a Boy's Adventure Tale"" are observations from a different perspective than the typical radio song while the closer ""Here I Stand and Face the Rain"" hints at the darker material a-ha would perform on their next album Scoundrel Days."
5,Jay,Great Music.... Great Beats ! Its 90s + 80s POP + ROCK...Vocals are great....Songs are fats paced but whole CD gets over in no time... I mean Its so fast paced you don't realise the time..All songs are good and tune just stays in your mind...Makes you play that song again and again.... Great Great CD...Wish I had this CD long time back....
4,Better Than Their Peers,"There were a lot of bands doing this type of music in the mid-80's, but a-ha did it better. Some of the songs suffer a bit lyrically, and ""Take on Me"" of course overshadowed everything that came afterwards stateside, but ""I Dream Myself Alive"", ""Train of Thought"" and ""The Sun Always Shines on TV"" remain excellent songs."
4,Better on further listenings,"I'm the one that gave three stars last time, but I've revised my opinion upwards--in case anyone's interested! The album has grown on me, especially ""The Blue Sky"" -- catchy, with sentiments both sophisticated and sensitive. Kids may like the sound of a-ha, but the angst is definitely adult."
2,One-HIT WOnders !,"A-HA was a one-hit wonder, at least in the USA, where only ""TAKE ON ME"" received an absurd amount of MTV and radio display, to the point of becoming unbearable to ever listen again!!In Europe, mainly int he U.K, thing were a little different, A-Ha being able to resist for more than five studio albums. BUt that was never a band to be taken seriusly. Other than the very good vocals, the ultra-pop-synth music is lifeless, industrial and toally electronic. That's why they succumbed."
5,Wonderful!!,I love this cd! Has many great songs on it that I haven't heard before. Demos and things on the second disk are well worth the listen. Wonderful way to get to know this group. I highly recommend it.
4,20 years later and still a blast!,"What better way to start off an album than with quite possibly the best song of all-time ""Take on Me"". Strongly followed up by 9 80s pop masterpieces, this album makes for a great listen from start to finish. So you're having an 80s party and need some tunes? Don't forget to set it off with ""Hunting High and Low"", you'll be glad you did."
5,One of the best from 80s,"If you call yourself a music fan, whether of general music, or specifically 80s music, this is a must own. Although 2 songs on here were big on USA radio for a while, the rest of the songs are excellent. Nice mix of pop rock, and more soft pop songs. Very addicting songs, excellent melodies and just a great album in general, you will not be disappointed."
3,Many highs with a few lows,"3 1/2When fevered eighties inspiration came to our modern pop groups, it came quickly. While it's hesitant to use the dreaded OHW terminology to A-ha, it is also hard not to hear the potency behind HHAL eclipsing everything since."
3,A bit dated now,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. All of you remember ""Take On Me"" and it's one of -if no the best music video ever, but ""The Sun Always Shines on T.V."" was a solid hit as well back in the winter of 1985/1986. ""Hunting High and Low"" was also a single that did decently in the spring of '86. So A-Ha is not a one-hit-wonder as many of you think."
5,"Before the ""curse"" hit them","You know the ""curse"", right? Once a group or singer wins ""best new artist"" of the year on any music awards show, they seem to be doomed. At least in the USA that is what happened to a-ha. A pity becauase there isn't a single track on this album that I didn't like. The lyrics speak of a yearning and a searching, and if you saw any of the videos they were well matched to the lyrics. But ultimately a-ha was very pop and the British accent very strong and the ""curse"" kicked in. If you have only heard their sole American hit, listen to a few of these and then buy this album if you like what you hear."
5,Timeless Masterpiece,"...as soon as the electronic drum beats spilled from my speakers, i was hooked. i immediately got the tape, and played it so much, it broke. the CD was quickly added to my extensive music collection. every track on this release is amazing. from the eerie ""hunting high and low"" to the ""living a boys adventure tale"", every song has spoken to me over the years...and over the thousands upon thousands of time i have listend to this album. yeah, i've gotten slammed over the years for loving this band (i have every album), but who cares, once u find a group that speaks to you through excellent musicianship, wonderful lyrics, and ear melting, creative music, why let go? this album sounds better now than it did that summer of '86. do yourself a favor...please get this CD...you will thank me and all the other a-ha fans around the world who have said the same thing time and time again."
3,Regietheater,"The book is copiously, indeed lavishly, illustrated. But be ye warned: the vast majority of the photos are of German modernist stagings. If your idea of The Barber of Seville is to see Rosina peeking out of a stage-model's left breast, this book is for you. Traditionalists stay away!"
5,great movie,"This is a wonderful foreign movie! So often foreign films are depressing, artsy or down right weird. But this one is funny and wonderful, the acting is superb, and the scenes are reminiscent of Moliere's work.The film is entirely in French, with English subtitle option. The story fictionally depicts what could have happened to Moliere during a short period of time early in his career. The story involves events which were supposedly the basis for his famous comedies. Simple storyline, great acting...a 'must see', if only for the ""acting lesson""."
5,A Rich Tapestry,"I had never seen a play of Tartuffe - though I knew that this was a great comedy by Moliere. Watched this tonight as it was broadcast by the BBC and was utterly entranced by the quality of the acting, the filmscore, the hilarious plot, the 'plays within a play' and the visual feast of 18thC France brought to life so vividly on screen. If you want to laugh and cry and feel all the human emotions of empathy, love, pity, sadness and joy - all within a couple of hours - buy this film and watch it on the largest screen you can access. I will definitely go to any theatre that is showing a comedy by Moliere in English - for the rest of my days."
4,Charming!,"Moliere is by far one of my most favorite writers of all times. At school at had to learn his masterpieces and act them in front of my classmates. As I watched the movie, I was thrilled to see how the producers came with an idea of what Moliere did during a 2 year period that is not documented in any of the historical references of the period. There is humor, there is love and there is definite passion in this movie. It mixes the most remarkable materpieces of Moliere. It is a movie to treasure for all of those who like me admire Moliere and his humourous wit!"
1,In a word: Boring,"This story would have been better told in a half hour or (maybe) even an hour long show. It drags on and on and on, and even though you want to know what happens to most of the characters, getting there is almost painful. It does show how drugs destroy lives, but there are so many unnecessary scenes and some that don't even make any sense. The actors are okay, but their talent is wasted in this snooze-fest. It tries to tell a story about a doctor who steals prescription medications and ends up trading them for illegal drugs, and it throws in alcohol abuse for good measure. But in the final analysis, ultimately it misses."
4,Res is Exceptional!,"How this album and its artist are not huge stars- or at least have dedicated audiences - is beyond me. This album is an excellent twist of R&B;/Modern Rock, with a little bit of Alternative thrown in.Any artist that can successfully sample The Cure, let alone combine it in an R&B; song, is ok in my book.But Res isn't just a one-trick pony -- ""Golden Boys"" and ""They Say Vision"" are two of my favorite songs from any artist. They are hidden jewels that I love to play in front of my friends just to get them to ask ""who is that?"" ""what song is that?""If you are tired of hearing the over-hyped, under-talented packaged cupcakes on the radio today, then treat yourself to this great debut album from a truly creative and gifted performer.I eagerly await her sophomore effort."
5,4.5 Stars,"Love this girl, great talent with an off beat vibe in the often predictable R&B genre. If you dig Res check out Esthero's ""breath from another"" album Another great ""trip hop"" release."
5,Amazing Album,Ive had this cd for over 2 years now and i still play it at least once a weekit got a scratch and im buying it againIve known the garden and Tsunami are my favoritesim not normally into this style of music but this cd changed my mindif you like this you should get Estheros Breath from anotherit is also an amazing cd
4,they say vision,"This album is hot! i bought this after hearing the They Say Vision because i was sold! i didn't know my friend had worked on the video for it either until after i bought it..either way i look at it this is a great CD to own. At once political (They Say Vision), in the realm of love (Ice King, 700 Miles) Res can pull off the style, the lyrics, and the tone. She has a great voice and a knack for conveying a message in a way that won't make you bang your head against the wall."
4,This chick is ILL,OKAY IM NOT REALLY EVEN INTO ROCK OR NEO SOUL WHATEVER U PEOPLE CLAIM THIS KINDA MUSIC SHE SINGS IS . BUT AFTER I HEARD 2 OF HER SONGS I HAD TO GO OUT AND BUY THIS . I REALLY LIKE THIS CD AND I USED TO WONDER WHO THAT WAS SINGING ON THAT GZA TRACK ON BENEATH THE SURFACE . R E S . ANYWAYS I JUST FELT LIKE WRITING A REVIEW ABOUT THIS CD IS VERY GOOD . AND I THINK SHE IS THE GIRL OF MY DREAMS . BUT SHE MOST DEF HAS HER OWN STYLE . PEACE OUT CD NOW PEOPLES !
4,Pretty Good!,"I wouldn't say it's the BEST thing I've ever heard, but I it is a really good c.d. She doesn't look like how she sound so the cover decieving. You'd probably think she sounds like Lauren Hill or Alicia Keys.Instead, she's a lot Edgier...think a hybrid mix of Anastacia meets Nelly Furtado. She teamed up with the ultimate bad-ass producer ""Doc"" McKinney! He laced the c.d. with some pretty phat beats..it's pretty hot! I enjoy it a lot, although there are still some filler tracks and a really stupid-sounding hidden track at the very end.It's good music ANDIt's a good buy because it's definately better than a bunch of the crap they play on the radio."
1,Don't bother,"I purchased the CD because it was heralded as a neo-soul release and the price was right. How could I go wrong? I made a mistake buying this CD because there is no soul in it, it is too folksy and the sistah appears to be running away from the likes of Aretha, Patty and Whitney. This CD may have some possibilities and maybe under the wise hand of a Kedar Massenburg, it would have turned out much better. Spend money on the underappreciated Angie Stone CD where mahogany soul music lives and inspires."
3,A Good (not Great) Debut,"Try as I might I haven't really been able to get into this debut album by Res. The tunes including ""Golden Boys"", ""Ice King"", and ""Sittin Back"" are certainly pleasant enough but I found the synthy psychedelic meets drum-and-bass sound of the disk a bit too repetetive. Res (short for Shareese--why oh why does everyone have to be Sade when it comes to spelling & pronunciation of their name?) owes much of the albums appeal to Santi White (lead vocalist for the Philly band ""Stiffed"") who wrote the lions share of songs here & was also instrumental in getting Res a recording contract and management. I'd say the disk is certainly worth the $6.99 I paid for it new but something about Res seems just a little too neo-Soul formulatic, right down to her twisted extensions. Hopefully, by the time her second album is release we'll here more from her and not her producers."
4,...an updated review...,"...res is definitely alternative!!i wasnt really feelin this when it came out...and most days i still dont...HOWEVER, this cd has grown on me....not much, but anuff to make me upgrade this release from 3 stars to 4.i cant really claim to have a favorite song here, it's all much different from what top 40 will ever play.i like esthero's album and this is reminiscent of that....this is a good album to enjoy for those days when nothing is really inspiring you or just when you feel like hearing something different when you get bored with everything else.i'm hard to please, but i'm open-minded...sometimes...give yourself some time to grow into this...a month or so from now, you might be asking yourself why you dont play this more often.(or maybe you'll make a coaster of it...who knows.)"
4,It's Tight and different!!!,"Hay now!!! i heard Res's five song sample about three months ago and i fail in love with the five that were on the CD. My favorite song is ""Golden Boys"", but ""Ice King"" especailly the remix with Nas is that deal. Anyway the CD is tight as hell and i hope that she starts to make some noise in the music industry and on the radio. And she needs to make a radio for ""Golden Boys""Peace Out!!!"
5,Still can't pick a favorite track,"This CD is already at the top of my playlist! It's got a great vibe from start to finish. A beautifully put together mix of songs and sounds, it's tough to choose a favorite track. If I was pinned down, I'd have to pick '700 mile situation'. Res has a beautiful voice that blends perfectly with the sounds and atmosphere of each song. Check out the web site ... , you can sample just about every track on the CD. The title track, sittin' back, 700 mile, and Tsunami are all very different and very good...making for a must have summer CD!"
4,Another wonderful new artist,"Next to Jurassic 5 and Nelly Furtado, this is the third album I have bought only by hearing word of mouth. I am finding this method of buying, so far, beneficial. ""How I do?"" is Res (pronounced Reese) debut album. I was surprised to hear such small vocal range utilized by this opera trained singer. Despite this fact, the vocal stylings meshed well with the trip hop stylings used by her band. Her blend of hip hop, jazz, and rock was reminscent of Mono or Esthero. Res's vocals could really be compared to that of Esthero, whom can also be compared to Bjork. The blend of trip-hop, rock vocals, and urban savy lyrics proves to be a sweet sound."
5,Truly Genius,"She is a breath of fresh air, I Remember hearing ""Golden Boy"" on vh1 late one night, and I wasnt looking at the screen..but these BEATS came to my ears and i looked up...and was HOOKED~!...ran out and bought the cd and was pleasantly surprised. I didnt think i would like all tracks! im picky about music really picky! but she really stuck with me, standouts are ""700-mile situation"", ""If There aint nuthin"",""tsunami"", ""Sittin back""..heck all of em are good, try it. if you like a mixture of textures, youll love it!"
4,Does anyone else hear the Stevie Nicks influence???,Not your typical cureent R&B garbage - really nice!
5,THIS IS GRAMMY MATERIAL STRAIGHT UP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,THIS ALBUM IS SO OFF THE HOOK I CAN'T BELIEVE THE VOCAL TALENT OF THIS BEAUTIFUL BLACK WOMAN. HER VOICE IS VERY EARTHY AND COOL ITS HARD TO DESCRIBE. IT MAKES ME SO MAD TO SEE TALENTED PEOPLE LIKE HER GETTING NO PLAY ON THE MAINSTREAM AND URBAN RADIO.HER MUSIC IS CLASSIC! SHE WILL BE AROUND 4 A WHILEAN ESSENTIAL MASTERPIECE
3,RES ~HOW I DO~,"THIS ALBUM WAS AIIGHT, IT TOOK ME BACK TO THE EARLY 80'S BUT WITH MORE OF A POLITICAL FEEL. SHE'S A CHICK AFTER MY HEART. SHE TAKES ME BACK TO NY. HER ALBUM WAS PEACE."
3,"A bit mixed, but....","This is disc does not fit the mold of contemporary female driven R&B. It reminds me of Lauryn Hill, but just the slightest bit less inspired. Luckily, there are no ""Insert Song Title Here featuring: Insert Rapper Name Here"" songs, which is a refreshing change of pace. What keeps at like, and stops me short of love is the lyric writing. Though poignant at times, and clever at others, a bit more polish would take this record to the next level. Let Love and They Say Vision are excellent, but the rest of the songs on the album fall short of these two high watermarks."
4,Finally!,"Not your average album, which is such a relief. Res has got something everyone will like with hopefully more inovations in the future. With a ""Tsunami"" of sounds, smooth beats, and her sultrous voice and lyrics, definitely a must have."
5,This is R&B Science Fiction,"This is it people. Res is one of those artists (like Alana Davis, Kelis, Me'shell Ndegeocello) that is just doing something so incredible that you can't define it. That's why I call it Sci-Fi R&B, this isn't from earth. Mere mortals can't resist ""Golden Boys"" I love that song. I also love the entire disc. It just flows from beginning til end. My friends love it too. When they listen to they are like ""OMG! This is it!"" This is some music you need to get. I also recommend Me'shell Ndegeocello's forthcoming album ""Cookie: The Anthropological Mix Tape"" in stores June 4!"
3,Not Bad,"""They-Say Vision"",""Ice King"", and ""100-Mile Stuation"" had me on my toes, but the rest of the cd lacked a little something. ""Golden Boys"" was a bit on the corny side, and as the cd played on, It lost the bite that it had with the first few songs. Otherwise, Res will charm you with her snazzy music and energizing voice."
2,"Return of the Mack...Fleetwood, that is.","Its not poor songwriting or musicianship. More like a lack of 'Vision'(pun intended). This disc seems like a thinnly veiled attempt to urbanize the sound and image of a classic Pop/Rock vocalist.Fleetwood Mac was/is a great band. But Stevie Nicks haunting-but-whining vocals can be downright annoying to hear at times, whether you're in your car or an elevator. Res' singing and music is like a polished and refined version of that sound. If you're wondering what Nicks would sound like singing Neo Soul/Pop, this might do it for you.And for the record my personal fave is, ironically, 'They Say Vision'. Definitely worth downloading."
1,Oooooh I didn't like it!,"I'm easy to please I think regarding music. But I did not enjoy this one at all. I enjoy selecting music that isn't at the top of the ""list""....and I get so excited when I find something that's just awesome....and it happens more times than not. I rarely select something that turns out to be a bummer. But I'm sorry to say this one is a bummer in my opinion."
1,Best used as a coaster,"I had high hopes for this disc, given the positive press that surrounds Res and the first single off the album but I found it incredibly dull and lacking in many respects. Some of the other reviewers wrote about funk and R&B but to me it sounded like someone trying to imitate Natalie Merchant singing reggae. Worse still, the beats were weak and most of the tracks sounded the same. Her lyrics did have some value but they couldn't make up for the overall lameness. Needless to say, I am sure it will be huge in Europe."
5,Swirling Hungarian,Abbado and the Wiener Philharmoniker truly invoke a swirling pattern of dances. The sound is excellent although the album is a bit short [48:16]. These symphonic dances by Brahms are definitely on the tier with his symphonies and concertos. Abbado's interpretation is full and lively allowing my mind to wander between the escalating tempos and the calm vistas in between. Definitely recommended if you enjoy Brahms. I understand that this Abbado/WP recording has been in circulation ever since it was released in 1983.
2,"Michelangelo, Raphael and NO IMAGES","The tale of Michelangelo and the pope's ceiling is well written if somewhat disconnected in parts. I truly enjoyed the story, even though it was a bit dry and lacking in available primary source material. But, what really annoyed me about the book (and also Picasso's War) is the lack of images. The color images of the Sistine Chapel's ceiling are small (an understatment). There are more-than-adequate images available on each panel, let alone the entire ceiling. Why are they not used. King speaks for pages about Raphael's 'School of Athens' but we only see the cartoon/drawing, not the painting. One should not be expected to sit with an art history text while reading the book !!"
5,Excellent,"This book is truly excellent. Very wide scope: it covers from the psychology of the artists (particularly Michaelangelo and Raphael) and that of the Pope (Julius II) to the materials used in the colors, and the techniques of fresco painting. I enjoyed the style and the pace. A book to relish."
4,The Agony and the Ecstasy Revisisted,"The epic confrontation between Pope Julius II and Michaelangelo produced arguably the best fresco the world has ever seen.The oral narrator does a superb job in presenting this book andexplaining this intriguing story of Renaissance history. My only criticism is that, at times, the book is so detailed about the technical art problems of the fresco (e.g. how to get the right colors of paint from Florence or Venice) as opposed to unraveling the mystical and poetic symbolism of the fresco itself. Nevertheless, this is a fine audio product and well worth purchasing."
4,Great Depth in a Readable Format,"This is a wonderful book for anyone planning a trip to the Sistine Chapel, hoping to go or who has ever visited. Ross King has done a marvelous job of making events from 500 years ago come alive for the modern reader. It avoids the soap opera nature of ""The Agony and the Ecstasy"" and, while a bit dry, is never boring."
4,Vicki,"Fascinating historical account of how the ceiling was painted along with the drama of Michelangelo's life. I had no idea how the church operated during this period of time. That was equally as interesting as the history of fresco painting. If you are an artist or Catholic, it's a must read!!"
4,Beauty In Context,I thoroughy enjoyed this book. I liked it best for the context it gives to this famous work.
4,good condition for second-hand,Have not read it yet but look forward to doing so as I am sure it will be very fascinating
5,Painting the Sistine Chapel,"I saw the Charlton Heston - Rex Harrison movie about Michelangelo and Pope Julius II many years ago, and so assumed that I knew a lot about the painting of the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. After reading this book, I realize that I was very wrong! This work is extremely well written and fast-paced. We get mini biographies of numerous historical figures, plus great dollops of Italian and European history to boot. The author tells a terrific story in lucid prose, and the reader is simply fascinated with how the painting was accomplished. Even though the romantic notion of Michelangelo paining by lying on his back for years, paint dripping all over his face, is not factual, the true tale is every bit as fascinating! This is one of those niche pieces of history that is well covered by this book, and I highly recommend this work to anyone with a penchant for the offbeat in historical action."
3,WARNING! DECEPTIVE BOOK!,"I read through the book over a few weeks, and it was certainly very interesting and informative, it made me want to visit the Vatican the next day. However, the WORST PART, be thee fairly warned, King goes into certain parts of the painting, or cites influences and provides barely any visuals to back them up. My eyes hurt from squinting at the very small, color centerfold of the ceiling, I was very diappointed. Yes, there are black and white illustrations of Santi, DaVinci, and Bounnaratto's works, but IT'S A BOOK ABOUT ART! The lack of picutures really left me wanting more, and I was embarrassed that even part of the painting was cut off and not included in the paperback version of the book I had, so King would describe say, The Punishment of Haman, I think, and there wasn't even included in the centerfold, WEAK!"
3,Good... but somehow not so good,"I know I'm a lone voice on this, but I felt the same way about Brunelleschi's Dome. This book really should have been fascinating: it is so chock full of very interesting information about a range of very interesting subjects... from the art itself to Michelangelo's whiny family to the crazy Pope who wants to be a soldier. Between the fights, battles, and plagues it should have been an action-packed adventure through the streets of 15th century Rome. Somehow, though, the author's writing style is so dry that it has taken me months to get through this book, when it should have only taken a few days. I kept wanting to get back to it, but when I picked it up I would get so bored that I would quickly put it down again.I don't want to not recomend this book... it is well researched and about some very fascinating subjects. Other people might not mind the dry writing style. But you might want to read a chapter before you buy it to see if you take to it."
4,An oversight in illustrations...,"This is a highly-entertaining book that makes me enthusiastic to learn more about Renaissance Italy. There is one apparent oversight: taken together, the color plate images of the chapel's ceiling do not represent a complete picture of the ceiling itself. The portion of the ceiling close to the altar wall is missing, despite its being discussed and praised in the text. This was an annoyance. Perhaps it can be corrected in a future edition."
2,too many bad disks,"I tried this Memorex light scribe 50 pack for the first time. So far, 2 out of the first 6 disks were defective and would not burn the image. That is a bad percentage as these cost quite a bit. I will not purchase this brand again."
1,Don't get these!,"I used to hold the name ""Memorex"" in high regard when it came to recording media. I wanted to use my Lightscribe drive to add some class to the labeling of ""keeper"" DVDs so I relied on the Memorex brand name.Bottom line: Just about every other DVD burned will not play in either of my Sony DVD players. The disc tries to load and a message displays saying the disk is dirty. I re-burn from the same source file to the next blank in the bundle and it works fine.Getting 25 out of 50 makes this an uneconomical purchase, not to mention the frustrating waste of time. Pick a different brand."
4,Good backup storage media,I have used many light scribe packs for my backup requirements. All of them have worked out fine as expected. Writing to the entire DVD at 16x speed takes about 15 mins. Printing on the lightscribe side takes another 15 mins for the best quality.The technology has not advanced enough yet to provide color prints. This makes color images to show up shadowy. Better preview the image in b/w to see how it would look on the DVD. Another downside that I notice is that a pack of 50 usually has a couple of faulty DVDs. YMMV.
3,Lightscribe DVDs,"These disks are perfectly good and, in all fairness, do precisely what they are supposed to do, but the printing on the disk itself (the very reason I bought Lightscribe disks in the first place) is not at all dark or sharp. One can read the title of the disk, but not easily. This may be a weakness in the technology, itself -- I have no other Llightscribe disks with which to compare these -- or it may be that some disks produce a sharper, darker image than this particular brand."
3,Not quite awesome,"Coaster percentage is much higher than with Verbatim or Taiyo Yuden discs. Lightscribe labelling shows up mighty faint, though that could be the drive's fault."
2,LightScribe image fuzzy,"The data side recorded my DVD just fine, but the LightScribe image was fuzzy. I burned the exact same image (with the exact same drive) on a sample LightSribe CD from HP and it was sharp with better contrast."
5,amazing,"My review is very simple...2002, when i first heard dax, I was walking through a mall in Clackamas, Oregon on the second floor and just stopped. I had to listen. The only other pianist I had really known at the time were Winston who turned out to be a big influence for Dax. When I heard him do a custom rendition of Colors/Dance by George Winston I immediately felt something in his music. I bought this CD immediately and I can't even describe how it touched my when I heard his music. I have seen him in concert and listen to his CD's over and over and yet the music never dulls. He puts an unheard of passion into his music and I for one, will always be appreciative of it.I also recommend his second album, The Random and the Purpose, which is one of my absolute favorites. Keep going Dax."
2,Dreadful,"Herbert von Karajan never understood Bizet's Carmen. This opera was composed for the Opera-Comique with dialogues, not unlike Offenbach's operettas. Karajan conducts an opultent, glossy performance were the drama and style are completely drown. Agnes Baltsa had a great Carmen in her, so she is the great loss of this recording. Carreras is touching and vulnerable, but his French is just terrible. Even worse, the use of actors in the dialogues is completely unacceptable and ridiculous. DG has the finest CARMEN ever recorded with Teresa Berganza and Claudio Abbado. Everything that is wrong in Karajan's recording is right in the Abbado. Please buy the earlier, much greater recording, even the ADD sound is finer than this digital mess."
1,The most rotten book on the baseball stats market,"I bought the book, so I could use it as a reference to last season's baseball action. But when I open the book, I see that only the batters with 325+ at bats has all of their statistics. The others has just Day/Night, Left/Right and a few of them has month-by-month's record. If you want to throw money out off the window, be my guest."
5,New England frontier tribes,Michael Johnson has through Osprey produced a series on the amerindian tribes.For these interested in brief sketch histories of the tribes of the regions they are quite good.This one on the tribes of New England pretty much serves that purpose.For those interested in period information there isn't that much.The illustrations by Jonathan Smith are quite good though figure A6's hands are too big and too mature for a child's.
1,Worthless biography based on facts subsequently disproven,"The entire basis of this biography was disproven by research conducted in 1998 and published in ""The American Genealogist"", 73:161-171. This biography is now practically worthless and should not be purchased by anyone interested in historical or genealogical accuracy."
