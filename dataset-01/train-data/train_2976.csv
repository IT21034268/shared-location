2,Do not buy unless you want a leaking humidifier,Had this humidifier for less than three months and it started leaking all over my hard wood floors. It leaked around where they have the inserts for the wheels. When it wasn't leaking it worked great and was very easy to fill.
5,"Works Great, easy to Fill","I bought this humidifier to replace another model from the same manufacturer that still worked well, but was a PITA to fill with water. The previous one was one of those with 2 water bottles you have to fill at the sink and then flip them over and insert them into the unit. This one you fill up the unit from the front. I have a hose connection in the room where the humidifier is, so it is super easy now for me to fill it up.Update:After a few months of use, I can say it really gives off a lot of water, good thing it is easy to refill, cause it's needed to be refilled often :-)"
3,"It's okay, not great....","We bought this because our house is all electric, so it is VERY dry. Our skin has not been so itchy since we've gotten it, but it has a hard time getting above 40 percent humidity. We would like 50%, so we have to turn it on high and, as you have probably read, it is extremely loud, no exaggeration:( It is better than the little ones, and it is quite easy to fill and very easy to roll around to different rooms, so it's worth the money in the long run. I gave it three stars because i cannot get it to where i want it without that LOUD fan."
1,I am not trying to be mean....,"I love the Louvin Brothers and I love Charlie Louvin's solo work in the 60's and 70's, but this is awful. His voice is shot. Every song here is almost unlistenable. If you have heard him on the opry lately, then you understand. I was so disapointed with this CD. I truly want to say it is fantastic, but it is horrid. The CD packaging is fantastic. This was meant to be a very serious release, but Mr. Louvin just can't pull it off."
4,Cuts bagels not fingers,"Works great, will cut through even larger sized bagels.Very simple to use, and it doesn't take up a great deal of counter space. If there is a drawback it's that the blade doesn't cut throughthe entire bagel, but the two pieces easily pull apart."
5,Good Cutter,This device cuts evenly thru bagels for an almost perfect sized halves pieces.It is great when there are many people for the meal and helps prevent accidental cut from a knife.
3,I agree with the guy below,"Just like the guy below said, the playing on the CD is brillant (guitarist Jeff Lee Johnson, saxophonist James Carter, bassist Ngolle Pokossi, and drum leader Ronald Shannon Jackson), but whoever edited the CD faded out in some other the worst places, especially on Front Seat Frisco.Playing wise, the best tracks are Christmas Woman (free-funk tune), Front Seat Frisco (Carter and Jackson duet, Cameroon Morning (African-funk tune), and Opinions (avant-garde)."
4,"Eh, it works.","I just needed a TV that took up little space but gave a decent picture. This definitely fit those requirements. I wish however there was an audio output. Otherwise it works great. It would have been a better purchasing experience if once I opened the shipping box (which was in perfect condition), the box and packing foam that the TV is retailed in didnt look like it had dropped 10 feet so that they could fit it in the shipping box."
1,Less than a year old and quit working,"I bought this tv for my bedroom less than a year ago (closer to 7 months). With about average (less than 2 hours/day) use, the tv has just quit working. Customer support has been less than helpful. Don't waste your money."
1,Less than a year old and already died,Well I got this television on a black friday sale last year and less than a year old and mine has already died. It was watched very little in the bedroom and last night it just popped and quit working!
4,Great buy & Good Picture,"I bought this TV for my bedroom last Christmas. It has excellent picture quality and is very light weight. The sound quality is good but not great. I use the TV's speakers as a center channel with my surround sound system. This would be a good TV for the kitchen or a childs bedroom but is a bit small for viewing across a large room. It has been reliable so far with no problems. The remote is too small and the buttons make little sense, buy a universal remote you'll be much happier. It is affordibly priced and has better picture quality than a standard TV (the color and clarity is great but not as good as HD) For the price it's a good value."
5,Awesome for xbox 360,"This TV works great with an Xbox 360, and you can also enjoy watching cable with it, instead of having to buy a monitor and the VGA cables. Im pretty sure it should work great on any other console with composite HD AV cables."
1,"Horrible Movie, save your time",This movie had no consistency as far as plot goes. The acting was HORRIBLE and unbelievable. Granted it was a low budget film but if you're going to put a movie together...make sure the actors can ACT. The video quality was pretty bad to in some scenes. Stay clear and don't waste your time.
5,Alesana :),"This CD isn't one of their best, but it is awesome to hear some of their songs with an ""unedited"" sort of sound. It doesn't sound bad at all, just different. If you like Alesana get this."
5,A must for all DJs,"Bedroom DJ is a great read for all DJs - beginners or otherwise. Basically it's the humorous story of how a young technophobic woman over in London, England set out to learn how to DJ completely from scratch, after being dumped by her DJ boyfriend. She struggles with the usual stuff like buying the equipment, putting it together and then trying to learn mixing and scratching techniques. It's a fun and accessible guide and best of all she turns to the experts - DJs like Roger Sanchez, David Morales, Judge Jules, Cutmaster Swift and Dave Pearce - for advice and there are indepth Q&A sessions with these DJs, including anecdotes about when they were learning that you wouldn't normally read in all the trendy Djing magazines. An entertaining, accessible, non-patronising and informative read that shows you don't have to be a technical wizard or the coolest cat in town to have fun learning to DJ. As a wannabee DJ for some years I for one would thoroughly recommend it!"
5,Classy Pair,"These two could sing the phone book and I would buy it. Have loved them for years. Steve is great alone as is Eydie (Love ya Eydie your my favorite) but you put the two together and there is no other magic like theirs. Both are in their seventies now and still can knock your socks off. You really need to see them in person to get the full effect.This CD is wonderful for the solos and the duets these two perform. Taken from various solo and duet albums they have been re-engineered and sound wonderful. There has never been or most likely never will be a singing duo like this pair, their love for each other and love for the song make them a national treasure. Snatch this up, I am sure you will be back for more.............."
4,worth every penny,"a true delight. brassy-Bacharachian. great to hear ""I Just Want to Stay Here and Love You"" as well. You will not be sorry you purchaed it. Too few live recordings of Steve and Eydie exist on CD."
3,Pop yesterdays,"I bought this one for ""Pretty Blue Eyes"" by Steve Lawrence. Its silly but beautiful and part of what they call the innocence of my yesterdays! A simpler,more happy era; even with rose-colored glasses on."
5,AMAZING,I have a lot of the original books but was missing this one. I couldn't afford an original and am so glad that Buff was reprinted!
3,Descent album,"If you were a fan of One Side Zero's first release, like I was, you will be dissapointed in this album. It's totally different. They tried to make themselves a little more hard this time around, and it doesn't work for them. They were awesome with a more melodic sound, which is almost non-existent on this album."
3,Not what I expected,"Unlike most people who have written reviews for Onesidezero's second album, I have not heard anything from their first. When I saw them under similar bands to Framing Hanley, I went to their Myspace page and listened to Sleep and My Confessions, I expected the rest of the album to be somewhat similar to those songs. They are not in my opinion and are not even close to sounding the same. It sounds as they try to sound like Shinedown a little too much. Now I'm not saying they don't have talent, they do and if they were to try and make their music more like their two hits they would have something going here. Probably an excellent live band but this cd did not live up to my expectations."
4,"Amazing photos, great descriptions. I'd like more detail.","This is a coffee table book if ever there was one. It's HUGE. That's great for us picture hounds though. The pictures in this volume are fantastic, covering more areas of the Imperial German Army than you probably thought existed. Commentary on the pictures is fairly informative, and often amusing. I would have liked a more thorough detailing of the gear that the various subjects are wearing, and how these things changed over the course of the war. The color insignia plates are also a nice addition, but some explainations in English would have been useful. As a WWI reenactor (I know, odd hobby), I am always looking for new sources for information on German uniforms, and this is a good one. As this might be part of a series, I'd like to see a future volume that actually details specific pieces of personal gear of soldiers."
3,For early war interest only!,"While this book was VERY informative and contains a large amount of photos reflecting hard work by the author, the title is deceiving when it says 1900-1918. It should say 1900 to 1916. There is ONE picture of a soldier in a Stalhelm, and post 1915 gear. If you are looking for early war photos, this book is for you. However, stay away if you are looking for a detaild description of equipment, especially for the post 1916 years."
3,help with children's church,I haven't had time to really get into the book but it will be helpful with teaching children's church.
1,Not valuable,Good: Quick readBad: Lack substanceConclusion: Waste of time and money. Perhaps i expected a more spiritual self help book of which this book isn't.Recommend: Watch a movie instead
5,ROADMAP FOR GOLDDIGGERS,"While skewering the arrogant and the greedy, this humorous guide provides the reader with tools and tips for travelling, attending social functions and enjoying the company of the jet set."
4,Its merely a stab at droll humor,"Save for a listing of high profile charity events, everything in this book is deadpan humor.It amazes me that anybody is taking it seriously."
3,Let's Be honest!,"This book I Felt was in the medium.It could have been better written,but it's coming from a male.I did like the short stories on what each man felt about the type of women they dated.Very Interesting!I felt if you were a women that was not A 10 he basically let you know that you need to throw in the towel because your chance are not good marring a rich man.I think it sends the wrong message.Is there truth to this maybe,maybe not.He had some ideas how to meet the rich,socialize,and identify rich when you see it.Short book.So I rated 3 could have been better.Short book also."
3,Not Impressed!,This book has very few tips of how to land a rich man. Things that you've probably already heard or read if you are into these types of books. I really was expecting a lot more info. Very disappointed! Ginie Sayles is a much better read for this kind of info.
2,too much copywork,I am returning this book. I wanted one that recipes could be inserted into; guess I misunderstood what this book offers. It just has pages to copy recipes onto.
2,Yikes,This is a very expensive book for 65 pages. Eye catching title. Some of the ideas were good but I thought the writing style was very poor. I chose this book because of all the other reviews. I was very disappointed.
1,It was one of the worst books I ever read!,It was boring. Do not read it. You will be bored until you want to jump out the window.
2,One word Boring,I read this book for a school book report that I had to do. And it was like every 5 minutes I was looking for a excuse to put it down it is very slow and Boring book. And has no actual conclusion to it. But for those who like books about nature and trying to find yourself it's a good book.
5,I liked this book even though it was a little slow moving.,"The setting is in the summertime. The protagonist, Wil Newton who is 15 years old has just moved to Minnesota from Wisconsin. Wil doesn't like the moved but to make matters worse his parents aren't getting along. Every morning Wil leaves home and goes to an island. On this island he watches the loons,and the fish. He also writes and paints. But Wil has a problem--Ray Bunner, the bully. Wil decides he wants to live indefinately on the island. Wils parents become concerned because they begin to think he is crazy. During his stay on the island Wil discovers two things: nature and himself. Paulsen may be a little slow moving in this book but I think he did a great job. There is a line in this book that I have thought about a lot and that is when Wil says ""if I can learn a fish, I can learn my father."" I recommend this book to people who don't want a lot of adventure and action but a book to learn important lessons."
3,Half exciting - Half boring,"Gary Paulsen has created a book about a boy that stayed on an island by himself. Paulsen describes what the boy's hobbies, interests and feelings are. I didn't think that Paulsen did a very good job at telling what the boy thought of different animals. When he did it seemed that those parts went on forever. But when news reporters came out to interview the boy those parts were a little bit more exciting. The Island didn't appeal to me but it might appeal to you."
2,The book you would want to read!,"I didn't like the book""The Island"" because I don't know what Wil was trying to learn by staying on the island on Sucker Lake. I liked the way Wil fought Ray Bunner though. I would recommend this book to anybody who likes nature and enjoys other Gary Paulsen books."
5,Alex's book review.,"This is an EXCELLENT book to read. It's about this kid who moves to a small town in Wisconsin, meets this girl, finds an island, gets beat up... The kid's name is Wil Newton. Wil is amazed at the small town atmosphere. He doesn't need to be worried about leaving his bike out, price of things, etc. he goes to the island every day until he decides to camp there for ""a little while"" which ends up being weeks. A girl named Susan helps him by bringing supplies to him. In the end, Wil's parents send a shrink to him to help him get over his ""problems."" All-in-all, A Great Book. Go read it."
5,It was a wonderful book.,"I read this book in Jr. high, seven years ago, and it is still with me today. I remember stopping many times to tell my mother about the things I discovered.. The boy achieved a level of understanding with nature that I envy. It was a powerful book, and I recommend it highly."
3,power of blue,"I rediscovered this Iain 's album recently.As I am an absolute fan perhaps I am not a good adviser anymore.But i would recommend it for one absolute gemm ""power of blue"" and at least 4 very good songs : the beat I walk ,god looked down, alone again blues and so many eyes. The other ones are for me not the best Matthews but when you think what the best matthews is , evn the whole record is much better than what thousands of other artists wouls deliver !"
1,"Undeveloped: prose, protagonist, author","Very self indulgent. It reads like the self-obsessed, adolescent voice in Catcher in the Rye, but without that novel's artistry or craft. It's as if Holden Caulfield never grew up. It exudes a general bitterness about humanity. The prose is workman like at best, awkward at most. It's the kind of revenge ramblings that would have been better left in a personal journal. It doesn't translate as literature."
3,Looking forward to Cactus Jungle,"I've read this one, and the Book of Man. I am looking forward to reading Cactus Jungle. I heard Barry do a reading about a year ago here in Phoenix at the MARS Gallery. In that reading (and I do believe it was an excerpt from the upcoming Cactus Jungle) he used the real names of real people. Barry, are you going to keep the real names in the book or are you going to use pseudonyms for these folks? You mentioned here that if you knew the person who claims they 'know' you (a reviewer here) that you would consider suing for defamation - are you concerned about the same thing or have you changed the names?"
4,"Clear, interesting, fun","I had to buy this book for a fiscal management class. It is probably one of the best management books that I've read. It is really clear. I don't really have a head for finance, but this book makes it simple and entertaining. There are lots of examples from real life. This is a great book if you want to know more about financial vocabulary and basics. Also might be a good brushup, though I was starting from scratch so I wouldn't know."
4,Good Guide to Finance Basics,"Many people in management today did not study for MBAs. Instead, they learned their profession on the job and have grown into senior positions. That makes for superb managers, but poor analysts of financial reports. Learning how to read and understand the ""numbers"" can't be overstated as a skill. And unless one has the time to go back to school and sit through countless accountancy and finance courses, the information isn't readily available. This is a great resource for learning that critical information, at least in its basic form. It is clearly written with simple examples that most people can grasp. As you might expect, it isn't riveting reading--but it sure beats the accounting and finances classes I recall.Amie Devero Author ofPowered by Principle: Using Core Values to Build World-Class Organizations"
3,very good for beginners,the book is soo basic but very helpful especially for non accountants or non finance practitioners. the topics are well organize. it gives me a review of the foundations in accounting and finance.
5,Excellent Book,"This book was very easy to follow. I love that it has full page tables to explain different worksheets. The author did a great job ""dumbing"" it down for someone like me."
3,Great for Non-financial managers,"Interesting and valuable book, for non-financial managers, lacks a bit on depth regarding valuations and more detailed explanations on Cashflow. Recommended for people who seek an initial understanding on grapsping the art of financials."
5,Excellence Education for the Non-Financial Person,"This book really unlocked a lot of topics around finance for me. Now I can accurately speak to ROI, COGS, COS, and more.I recommend it to any manager level individual who wants to understand the art and magic of what the finance folks do on a daily basis.// Dave"
5,Very valuable!,I highly recommend this book! It's an easy read for non-accountants! This should be in every manager's desk for quick reference. This has helped me a lot in making day-to-day decisions.
2,Disappointed,"While this book might be useful for managers with NO financial sophistication, it is too simple for entreprenuers. Also, I can't imaging anyone reaching a ""manager"" position without already understanding these basics."
5,What I need to know,"I am a non-financial SVP in a large credit union. This book helps me understand what the CFO is talking about. I can even add my two-cents to the ALM discussion. My contribution to the organization will never be financial brilliance but in the financial services world I need the back ground this book provides. Its clear, well organized, and right on point. I hope that all of my non-financial managers will read it."
4,Very helpful and on an understandable level.,Helpful to managers to give them insight into where accountants are projecting and where hard numbers are coming from. You are able to see sources of manipulation.
3,"Read it for class, wondered if the class was worth it.","I had to read this for a class, specifically before the first class session of the next one I'm taking. While it did do a decent job of reminding me what I had learned in my previous graduate accounting course, it didn't really tell me much I felt I would need to know for this class.PROS: Real life examples of how some companies have cooked the books makes this an easy read.CONS: Not enough depth to do much more than remind MBA students what they should already know."
2,Not what I expected!,"While the book provides a general idea of basic knowledge, it fails to provide more theory to truly provide that basic perspective. Still unable to truly read and comprehend a financial statement."
4,Manager directed,"I like the book, but it is very basic. If that is what you are looking for, then it does its job. I was looking for a little more meat, but overall a good book. Also, the real-life examples are excellent."
1,BEWARE. NOT AS ADVERTISED.,"The picture shows the new tapered ends on the strips, but they send the old kind with the square ends. False advertising."
3,test strips,"The test strips were only a month away from being outdated, that was disappointing. I would have like to have known that prior to the purchase. I was not able to use all the strips before expiration."
1,CHEATING THE CUSTOMER,"RE. PRODUCT RECEIVED IS NOT PRODUCT PICTURED. The picture shows the end of the strip cut away. This strip is the newest freestyle (not the Lite) and takes a miniscule amount of blood to test. The actual strips being sold have an end that is just square cut which takes a larger blood sample. Now the problem is that although both strips work with the meter, there is a difference in the product and the cut away strip is more expensive than the older version so the seller is falsely advertising the product being sold and in fact CHEATING THE CUSTOMER. In general it seems these strips are sold cheaply when they have a short expiration date. I guess that is why they are Cheap. My husband uses 6 or more strips a day with his insulin pump so this is not a problem and I believe that they can be used beyond the expiration date. How long beyond before they lose their accuracy, I do not know. I probably would not push it beyond 6 months or so."
1,Mislead,"I purchased this product 5-24-2012. I'm disappointed the ad shows a box of ""100"". When my order came, it was only a box of""50"". The ad is very misleading. I won't order from this company again. They better fix their ad."
5,Works on older machines,We purchased these to work in an older FreeStyle machine. The information provided by the seller was spot on. They are easy to use and require very little blood to work properly. Definitely reccomend.
5,I love this spice!,"This is one of my favorite spices. I love it on any type of fish, especially salmon. I sprinkle it liberaly on one side of the fish and bake. I've been putting it on chicken and pork and using as a marinade. I like that it's not overpowering. Unfortunately, it's difficult to find lately. Sam's Club used to sell it but I can't find it there anymore. Now Amazon is out...hopefully not for long."
2,intermatic analog wall timer,"This is one of few remaining choices on the market for analog timers, the particular application required such an option due to the age of the end user, combined with some physical disability issues. The product was replacing a earlier version of the same or similar model which had provided over 30 years of dependable service. this so far has not been the case with this product. In all fairness the model purchased was a refurbished one and this may be the cause of the problem, but the removable dial ratchets out of position causing the timer to fail to activate subsequent on or off commands..."
4,"Replacement model, works well, easy to install","Bought this to replace the ten-year-old model that was part of the house construction. Installation was easy, even for an UNhandyman like myself.Helpful hint: resist the temptation to quickly spin the dial in order to check on/off times, as this can damage the plastic internal workings (learned that the hard way with our old one). Be especially careful at on/off points."
4,Intermatic E1020 24hr Timer,"After adjusting the pin settings, the timer works as expected. It can be easily changed to work at different times of day."
4,fan timer,"Very quick deliverey, plus a very easy install,what more could you ask for. A little more expensive than I expected, the first one lasted 20 yrs. hopefully this one does also, Kurt"
3,timer replacement,"I purchased this item to replace the original (same brand, model) that came with the house. From other reviews, I understand that it has a lifespan of about 5 years, and I must agree. I was surprised to find this type of item on Amazon ... which also offered the best price."
4,The Story of Santa Claus,"A really charming tale about the origins of how Santa Claus started out. Great illustrations too, really lifelike. A book I would really recommend to read to young children at Christmas time, they love it!."
2,Lame-0,"I bought this book with high expectations. I teach dance, drama, and art to elementary school children and I found only one really good lesson from this book. There is a bunch of information on how to use national standards for dance in the classroom and some decent rubics, but as a whole...I wished I would have saved my money."
5,Belongs on Your Bookshelf Today!,"This book belongs on your bookshelf; you'll refer to over and over again! The unique and easy tips had me saying, ""Now why didn't I think of that?"" I have a stack of these books and hand them out to friends and family as soon as they announce they are expecting and boy do they thank me. I just have to say; budget friendly DOES NOT mean cheap, the ideas are useful and classy. I hope Ms. Danger will share another 1,000 tips soon!Jamie Novak author of A Busy Person's Guide to a Life You Love"
2,Did not find this book helpful,"I found most of the ""tips"" in this book to be either common sense or not useful. In example, I didn't need a book to tell me to have a baby shower, clip coupons, or buy things on sale. I doubt I'll use enough of the tips in the book to even get back the purchase price. If you really want this book, take the author's advice, and see if you can find it in a thrift store or garage sale."
3,So so,"This book has a lot of good ideas, but the name does not exactly fit. For example, there are many safety tips included. That's helpful, but the book is supposed to be about bargains. It does name websites you can go to, and other interesting ideas and tips. It's ok, but I was hoping for a little bit more from this book."
2,Author should have chosen original title!,"I'm so annoyed - I bought this book thinking it was the other, the *original*, Baby Bargains, and was confused after reading through tip after tip about looking for sales and going to thrift stores. To me, it seems the author is blatantly trying to make money off another book's success. It does have some useful websites, but I wouldn't waste money on the book to get them."
1,"Best bargain of all, don't waste your $ on this book","I got this book confused with Baby Bargains by Denise Fields. This book doesn't give you any insite into product purchasing but instead advises you on how to water down formula, save money on your daycare etc.... Tells you to borrow what you can from friends...yadda yadda.This is NOT the best selling Baby Bargains book that actually recomends strollers, cribs, etc.... This book mentions nothing about those."
4,Very helpful resource,"My husband and I are on a tight budget right now and this book has been very helpful, especially for first-time parents. It provides lots of practical advice and while some previous reviewers may claim it is all common sense, that is just not true. They have suggestions of things I would never have dreamt of (but are creative and useful from people who have already been there and have good suggestions to share.) I choose the tips that will be most useful to me and I am sure that I will come back to this book again and again."
2,quite flexible,My husband is a do it yourselfer that does this from time to time and he thought he'd like the knife. But the knockdown knife has a large clear section that is very flexible and doesn't apply as much pressure on the mud as he likes. It takes some getting used to. He might like it more down the road.
1,Bad cheap design,"I bought this humidifier a couple weeks ago and I'm experiencing big problems with this unit.The wick basket fell apart right after unpacking the humidifier. Please not it was not a defective basket, it was designed like this. The side basket hooks wouldn't hold the basket together , you should do some tricks and get the wire around .The automatic shut off system did not work! I woke up in the morning and there was no water left in the tank but the fan was still running . The rod that should turn the fan off is the worse design I've ever seen.I don't know who wrote those positive reviews for this product , my guess is they have been written by the guys who make those horrible products.Please beware and if you do buy this humidifier and get disappointed don't tell me I didn't warn you."
4,Good Humidifier,"This product works. It was able to raise the humidity in the large open area of my house from 33% to 60% no problem. It could have raised it more but that is the point I was shooting for.5 stars for performance.5 stars for easy filling.5 stars for easy maintenance.3 stars for control features.3 stars for construction.3 stars for noise.The plastic is thin, so if it were ever to be dropped accidently it would certainly break.It is reasonably quiet on the low fan speed. I can sleep with the fan noise at that level no problem. It is loud on the high fan speed. Too loud for listening to music or watching TV.I am satisfied with this product because it meets my need when other units failed to perform. I recommend it for its performance and easy maintenance at a lower cost than other large capacity units."
1,JUNK! LEAKS AND RUINS YOUR FLOOR,"The tank cracked at the points where the casters are mounted. Gallons of water leaked out and ruined my hardwood floor.The wick fits very badly. The manufacturing quality of the tank is very poor, nothing fits as it should."
2,motor only lasted two seasons,"Motor did not last. If you purchase, read the warranty. Motor is under warranty for two years (all other parts one year against defects). You must use Essick wicks or it voids the warranty. Contacting the manufacturer this week to see about a replacement motor. Paid $110 for 826-800 in June 2009, overpriced at $189."
1,What is the Skinner Box effect?,What is the Skinner Box effect? Why is it not explained in the descrition of the book? It sound like it degrades Skinner. Why?
3,This book was ok,"I purchased this book as required material for a class. The information in it was ok, but it did not impress me. This book could have been better."
5,a wonderful cd,"I finally go ahold of the English version of this and itis even better than I expected. Great stories and great music,I only wish it was easier to find"
5,You've got to get this CD!!!!,I just love this album. I can't stop listening to it. Anyone who appreciates thoughtful music will really enjoy this CD.
4,it works,the adapter works well with my laptop the only problem i have is that it may come out if i move the laptop.
1,Problem with machine,"The recorder worked for several days and then became unstable. The picture would roll uncontrollably, I was unable to correct this and was forced to return it."
1,Cheezy,"I knew the instant I hooked it up , that this was a loser; so I returned it immediately. Can't go by any brand names anymore...all made in China, all junk."
1,Terrible.,"No Tracking controls, cheap manufactured plastic, bad picture. Would not recommend to anyone and have never had a single video play properly. (and no, it's not broken it's just badly made). Don't plan on keeping mine, suggest you not waste the money."
4,Does the job,"A pretty basic machine, but it works just fine. The only disappointment was that the sound is mono...but a $2 adaptor allowed me to plug in both of my speakers and now it sounds pretty good. The remote has a simple layout that is easy to use."
1,"Mini statue, who requested it?",Me too tricked me by sending me the mini statue clearly stated when the dimensions of the large statue in the product specifications. From this point I will take more into account the views of users. Amazon should have a department to review and correct inventory errors regularly.
1,tired,This book is old and tired. I'm very sorry I bought this and the Centennial book. I tested recipes for California Fresh over 20 years ago and they remain superior to this collection.
5,Great collection of the best recipes.,Junior League recipes are proven winners. This collection never has disappointed me and a book I reach for time and time again.
3,The Junior League Celebration Cookbook,A Compilation of recipes from Junior League Cookbooks. A nice addition to my collection.
5,highly efficient,Just want to say these wiper blades are highly recommended. They are a snap(literally) to install. Will purchase for the passenger side.
5,Whoa Trivia,"This is a fun game for a bunch of old trail riders and horse lovers. We played it with teams. The only thing that would make it better is if the cards offered the correct answer. Sometimes the answer is No, but you don't know the right one. We threatened to set up a computer and google the questions!"
5,The best of Ambient!!!!,"Ever found an album where every song is good?! Ever found an album where every song is a musical satisfaction that pleases the mind as well as the soul?! Here it is! This is the most chill out ambient album ever made! Do you like the Cafe del mar collection or Air? Then u will like this album. If you haven't heard it... then u have missed out on some of the best ambient chill out in the world! I normaly don't write reviews , but when I saw that the best chill out album wasn't reviewd, I just had to sign up to review it! GRADE 5 stars no doubt!"
2,NYS Biology Teacher Grad Student,Not good for New York Biology CST exam! This book covers a lot of topics that are not asked about. Good for practice with test taking skills and facts but thats it.
2,not what i expected,"i was expecting to find more about the cst test, the format, different strategies, but all it was, was question after question"
5,dash kit,it fit perfectly in my 01 impala and the cd cubby is perfect for my ipod hooked threw rear aux. all in all greta product at a great price.
3,Alright,"The Mounting kit, isnt what i expected.There is nothing that keeps my boss 612ua radio in place but the dash in my 96 cutlass. If the dash isnt on, then it just slides around. It doesnt fit around my dash some around the bottom,"
5,Trim Kit,"Yes,yes,yes...........spend this little bit extra to finish your install,these along with Metra trim kits really do set off the look of the newly installed unit and the prices are great,use these along with a harness so you dont cut into your factory wiring and you will have a real pro finish,it doesnt cost much more for one of these so dont hack up your dash to save a few bucks.These look factory when installed and really are worth paying for."
4,Much better than the other brand I bought,Bought this after the first kit I bought broke during install (Metra I think it was). The quality is better even though it is still plastic. Fit in my truck without any issues.
1,Don't believe everything you read...,It say for 1992 and up GMC...This did not fit my 1999 Sonoma. I'm greatly dissapointed that I will not be able to install this magnificent looking product...
1,Does not fit 99 GMC Suburban,"To save yourself much hassle later. Learn from this feedback. This product will fit in the slot of the factory radio, but is to small. You will have about a quarter inch on both sides of the mount kit once you put the front plate of the dash back on.It does not come with any templets to fill in these gaps. So, I would suggest looking for one that does provide more versatility. I kinda blame Amazon's fitting guide that said this one will work. I wanted it for the pocket...epic fail."
1,Wrong product.,"This radio conversion kit is not made for a 2001 Chevy Silverado, it didn't even look close to the right one.I had to purchase the correct kit from the otfit that installed the radio for me."
5,perfect,perfect fit in my dads car i bought this for his bday and he is happy with the new stereo i got him too :)
1,Read the fine print,I learned my lesson. The title says 92 and up GM. Its not for all. It didnt come close to fitting in my truck so double and triple check that this will fit your vehicle before buying. Thank you to Amazon at least for providing great service on the return.
1,Did not work for 1994 Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera,I would check to see if Scosche's website list your car for this bracket. I wish I would have. No where on Amazon does it say that this would not work for my car. What should have been less than an hour project turned to half a day and a run to the local auto parts store buying a bracket that did work.
2,1995 K1500 CHEVY,THIS DID NOT FIT MY 1995 K1500 CHEVY PICK UP. IT IS 1/8 INCH TO TALL...AT LEAST IT WAS CHEAP
4,NOT FOR A 99 Suburban with factory tape deck in radio,"There are two different ones to choose between, this on and a 1483b. If you are like me and have a k2500 suburban with a tape deck In the radio with a separate CD player this is not the one for you. You will need for sure the 1483b."
4,It does the job,"Only thing I'd change is it needs to have the bottom pocket be able to be on top or bottom as needed since my radio needs to be lower to clear the dash pad with the pop out screen on my radio. If you have a Buick Riviera and a motorized screen, this isn't going to fit right."
3,"Fits OK, but no brackets to hold radio tight and plastic too flexible","My title about says it all. The fit of the kit is fine and I like having the built-in pocket. Also the price was reasonable. That said, even for a reasonable price I expected a better way to secure the radio. The kit does not come with any brackets and the only thing to hold the radio is friction between the radio collar and the opening of the frame. I ended up fashioning some brackets with metal strapping. Also, I have noticed a slight bend in the bottom of the fram (above the pocket) apparently due to the weight of the radio (and it is a standar sized radio). I get that its plastic, but again I would rather it not bend. All that bad said, now that it is in it looks pretty good and is working fine."
3,Poor Description,"I'm sure this product works fine in everything it is supposed to, my gripe is with how it's advertised as a 1992+ GM radio kit when in fact it will not fit into my 2002 pontiac grand prix."
2,scosche,"got this kit for my 2005 impala not that great of a fit,had to kinda force it in when installing back the dashboard,so it looks warped"
4,2000 OldsMobile Alero,"If you have the right stereo(small stereo) it should go by easily but i had to break a couple pices inside the dashboard to make the stereo fit(but thats the stereo problem) This kit fit so snug, and went in flawlessly, the only problem was that the squared front did not fit through the alero's panel so i had to chip away at the corners, took me a couple hours to install with the stereo and everything but the kit did its job, my only problem was the stereo, the kit supplied what you needed for the intstall of the kit itself,even spacers for if any reason the stereo didnt fit like me"
1,Don't waste your money,"The authors should probably next try to write about performing neurosurgery on your kitchen table. They couldn't possibly know less about that topic than they do about this one.Agents, contrary to what this book will tell you, do NOT charge reading or critique fees (not the reputable ones, anyway). And they are NOT brokers. Agents have fiduciary responsibilities to their clients; brokers have customers, for whom they are not fiduciaries.I could go on about all the flat out wrong and misleading drek between these pages but I'd have to open the book again. And I'd rather just send it back to Amazon. A shame it's so absurdly bad, as it's the only book I found on the topic."
2,THIS IS AN INSANE PRICE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! YOU CAN FIND IT MUCH MUCH MUCH CHEAPER,"the 2 stars is because of pricing- not the productwhen amazon sells and fulfills an item, it's usually the lowest price anywhereif an outside vendor sells an item- you have to check the price and here is a perfect examplethe pricing here is CRAZY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!look elsewhere and you will be shocked at how much you have overpaid here"
1,Sugar kills. Organic? Sugar kills.,"Attention, Hooked on Phonics folks. This is the second ingredient listed on the box: ""Organic Evaporated Cane Juice"". Get a LIFE, not diabetes."
5,Tasty!,Awesomely tasty cereal.Cocoa Beach is my favorite all time and also by Kashi.Kid cereal for adults.SCHWEET
4,"very good, quite ""cinnamony""","This is a very good cereal. I like having an organic alternative to shredded wheat. I like the texture and size of the biscuits and that it is lightly sweetened throughout. What I don't care for as much is that this Kashi cereal is too ""cinnamony"" for me. I don't fault the cereal since it is called ""Cinnamon Harvest"", after all. However, I would prefer a more subtle cinnamon taste. I like Kashi Autumn Harvest better."
5,Great cereal!,"I have yet to find a Kashi product that I don't like; and this cereal is especially tasty. I had already tried it before ordering from Amazon, so I knew it was ""safe"" to order six boxes at a time! Yummy."
1,Ten foot pole,"If you, by some bizarre chance, happened to stumble upon this little product, then I cannot urge you with greater sincerity or haste to step back real fast.'Haunting Fear', quite simply, stinks. I bought it at a video outlet sale (very very cheaply) out of curiosity, due to it apparently being based upon an Edgar Alan Poe story (which perhaps it is?). Anyway, personal regrets aside, this movie fails on every front. There is almost a presence of anti-suspense, due to the bland sets, washed-out video stock (that's what it looks like anway) and shocking acting. The only high point is the cheesy occasional porn-quality sex scene that at least brings a little humour into the proceedings.I really hate this movie. I wonder who really wrote it and why the hell it got funded."
3,This book is perfect for ghost hunters,"For all kids who like ghosts, and want to find some, order this book. It's cleverly written, with the diffrent types of ghosts, and diffrent ways to catch the ghosts. Even a few ghost stories. so for the kids who like a scare, buy this book."
5,An Exceptional Book,"This book is chock full of incredible photographs of the wonders of Antarctica. Any Diver, Swimmer, Marine Biologist or lover of the oceans will enjoy this book, its incredible photographs and well written text will add to your understanding of the underwater world of Antarctica. When people think of the southern continent, they picture the stark white ice fields and distant mountains. This book will let you see and appreciate the amazing life that goes on under the ice along the coasts. A rich and diverse ecosystem that very few have ever pondered, much less seen. You will be in awe of the amazing array of animals seen in this book. Penguins, Jelly Fish, Whales, and all manner of critters..."
4,Good for the price I paid,"I got two of these on sale for $152 for both and free shipping so for what paid, I was very satisfied. It comes with mounting plates and removable seat cushions.I also ordered a spider mount for the passenger side and a sliding mount for the driver. Sliding mount size for this seat is 7 1/4""W x 13 1/8""L. Seats are not too narrow and good for a center console boat."
4,Hammer-Drill Case,"I will, as it seems to be somewhat of a theme, mention that I purchased the 4 tool V28 set, and then, very soon afterward, came back and picked up the cases.The cases fit better in the truck, that's all. For a home user, they aren't likely to be needed. For a contractor, if you can fit the large bag in whatever you're using to transport the tools then you won't need them. If you have a service truck, these cases a great to keep everything nice and safe during transport.I do notice that the handle for the drill often pops out of its spot; it amuses me to see how it can do so even if the case has not moved or been bounced around on the truck. Outside of that this is great for carrying everything you need ~ drill with battery, extra battery, charger, and the belt clip."
5,Great fun--can anybody actually do this???,"Those who loved ""A Joyful Noise"" and ""I Am Phoenix"" will feel that they've hit upon a treasure trove in this group of poems for four voices. The only small disadvantages: this book only contains three poems (maybe somebody should write a sequel?), and the arrangement of the color-coded lines can be a bit confusing. (Each ""voice,"" or color, can have more than one line on a page.)So, have fun. And then go write a few masterpieces of your own. Keep the Big Talk going."
3,Great Idea but vocabulary to difficult,This book was a great idea and I loved the color and pictures but I think the vocbulary may be a little difficult for even some of my middle school students. The idea is great but the poems are not as great.
5,One of Austin's best,Another good one by an Austin legend !! Don Walser & his great voice are still missed around the Austin area
3,Spread Too Thin,"I'm a Don Walser fan and his forte is western. He does that very well. He is genuine and most of his music is fun to listen to. But, this is not his best CD. This CD is a mish-mash of genres - western, country, blues, oldies, and ballads. The title track, Texas Top Hand, is by far the best song and if you remember it in the movie ""Second Hand Lions"" you score points. Even Hollywood recognizes Walser's talents. The down side of the CD is that most of the tracks are average and they depart from the fun and upbeat style. The worst track is Danny Boy. No disrespect to all the Danny's out there, but I have never liked this song. If I was to be punished and had to listen to it, then I'm sure Walser's version would be tolerable. All that being said, I will keep this CD and I am glad that I bought it."
5,So Much Fun,"I had a Yano when I was younger, around 10 I think. I used to play with him all the time. The ability to change the stories was always fun and there were a lot of possibilities."
1,Parabens?,How could a product with parabens be for kids? I've been looking for gel to keep my daughter's hair out of her face... I almost bought this but then looked at the ingredients.
4,fun!,"I was happy to find a pomade for kids. I use it to style my 1 year old son's hair, or put it in a ""faux-hawk."" I love the grape scent, but my husband hates the scent. I think it works really well, but I wish it held the style a little better."
3,Smells good but greasy,Purchased this for my 20 mo. old baby boy since I am trying to grow his hair kinda long. I needed something to give it some control. This just makes his hair look really greasy. The hold really isn't that great either. It does smell yummy though. Might work better for short spikey cuts.
3,Scent is overpowering,"The product works okay; it provides some hold without being shiny or greasy. The grape scent smells really good, but is REALLY strong. Even when I only use a tiny dab of the product the scent is practically overwhelming and doesn't fade until I wash my son's hair again."
2,Memories and Visions of Paradise,"I was very disappointed in this book. I had read a book with the same title and by the same author, but it was almost 300 pages long. This book had very little of the information that the one I had read had. I don't know how a book with the same title and by the same author could be so different!"
5,Bill has enough trouble,You'd think these guys would go easy on the world's richest man. This book is a devastating poke at Bill Gates and his meglomania. I'm sure Mr. Gates isn't as bad as all that but the book is very funny. It's rare that you see such a high quality humor book. Ron Barrett is excellent--I also read his children's books to my kids...
3,New Book on Gates Comes Close,"Bill Gates' Laptop, by the same people who created O.J.'s Legal Pad, is an interesting parody aimed at Bill Gates. Unfortunately, the illustrations and concept are more interesting than the writing, which occasionally borders on the juvenile. But the graphics and illustration are worth the book's cover price and more than make up for some apparently uninformed writing. I will definately recommend this to anyone suffering from Microsoft-related stress."
2,"Uneven, messy and predictable. But nice ghost effects.","This movie is about a group of kids who go to a forested island in search of the missing father of one of the girls in the group. Soon supernatural horrors creep out of the woods and pick them off one by one. The whole thing is connected to an old mass murder case where a woman and her husband was lynched because the town believed they where responsible for the gruesome death of some children. If you have seen any vengeful ghost movies you have already seen this movie. The story is uneven and hard to follow at times. The characters are unmemorable. There are a few good ghost effects, and the ending is sort of okey. But seriously there are many far better vengeful ghost movies out there. However if you are a huge fan of the typical kids out camping in remote areas and are then picked off one by one by a supernatural menace type movies like myself then the movie is okey to give a watch. But it is by no means good."
1,A Pity,A pity Reuben Fine did not stay in chess and instead wasted his life on outdated Freudian psychology. His intellect was wasted!
1,Went through 3 of these before giving up,"The first unit we received had a defective fan. The second and third units were received broken. Not sure if it is a design flaw, but both were split down the back corner of the unit. I wish I could tell you how it works, but we never had a chance to try it. After the third return, we gave up on this one and went with a unit that was a little more expensive: Essick Air 697-500 Variable Speed Humidifier. LOVE the unit we have now and am about to write a recommendation for it."
4,Essick Air H12-400 Humidifier,"I thought this was a steal for the money. House is just over 1900 square feet and this Essick humidifier is doing a great job keeping it at 50% or so humidity over this tough winter. Low speed is very quiet and that's what we run it at. High speed really puts the moisture into the air if you're trying to play catch-up. Yes, the water container is a bit hard/tricky to fill, but once you get your own system doing it, it's just part of the deal. Very happy I picked this humidifier."
2,H12-400 Review,"The fill bottle came unusable. The assembler jammed the fill cap on, crooked and not screwed on because the threads had molding flash left on the jug.The ""Evening quiet"", fan position is not what I would call quiet.It does goes through the water. Functionally, I would rate it a 5 star."
1,a total piece of junk,"humidifier arrived with two long cracks in the housing and a medium size piece missing from the top panel. i was in a good mood, so i taped the cracks. but neither my husband (an engineer) or i were able to assemble the humidfier. the two basic parts didn't fit together. we spent an hour trying to assemble. good mood totally evaporated and i contacted the amazon return center to send it back and get a refund. hope this helps other shoppers."
3,"It works but its cheap, cheap, cheap","This product works, but it seems like it was cost reduced to the max. The plastic case is one piece and as thin as it could be without breaking. It has only one 2.25 gal tank to fill it, but it takes 4.5 gal to fill it, so you do it twice. The filler hose is cheap and kinked and looks like it came from a cheap aquarium, watch out when you use it. If it gets blocked by the kinks, water flies everywhere. The float switch is as flimsy as can be, mine does not really work unless you bang the side of the humidifier (not too hard, or the case might break). The fan is noisy as heck except on the slow speed, don't put it in a bedroom. But it works, it does humidify a house, for how long, I am not sure. Whoever cost reduced this product, do not go to work in the aviation industry, as I fly quite often."
2,12 gals a day but only holds 5....?,"Doesn't it seem strange to have a humidifier that disperses 12 gals a day but only holds 5 gals? That means you have to refill it twice a day. Why not have a large tank (say, 12 gals?) that you can fill easily with a bucket?"
1,Was sent a USED unit!,"This item was delivered in the original box, bottom of box was opened, with NO PACKAGING like styrofoam or anything! Outside of unit is all scratched and dirty. Power cord was a mess. Bottle of cleaner was leaking. Very poorly packaged, I am sending it back its obviously a used item."
1,Disappointed,I had planned on buying this unit until I read the reviews. Like others it's not so much the price but the reliablity. I always read the reviews on an item and glad they are available as we could be taken by a product. I don't understand why a company doesn't take buyers advice and fix the problem. I wonder how many sales are lost due to the higher ups blowing off reviews. Looking for another brand now....
5,Bemis H12-400 3-Speed Evaporative Console Humidifier,"Very few humidifiers work as well as the Bemis. I would recommend it to everyone. There is one cautionary note: Be sure to check the tank and reservoir every day. Five gallons of water do not last very long,so pay attention. This way the owner will have good, clean humidity. The unit is easy to take apart and clean."
1,Worked great for a time,"I bought this unit in December 2007. I really liked it, until March 2008 when it started leaking. I ended up (after trying it in multiple locations) propping the leaking end up with something. The water bottle had a pin-hole leak from day 1. The fan / motor is now only working periodically. Bemis/Essick doesn't allow email contact or support from their site, but routes you to service providers, none of which are in a state near me. I need to replace it, but since the price has gone up, and with all the trouble I've had, won't go this way again."
4,A Good Work Horse,"I bought this humidifier to combat the low humidity of NorthEastern Winters. My house is 2,400 Sqr Ft and this unit is stretched to keep the humidity above 40%. The highest speed is quite noisy and can only be used at night or when we are away. I recommend it but only for smaller homes."
3,A So-So Rating For Noise & Performance,"We bought this Humidifier based on good reviews for it here on Amazon, and for the fair price. The first surprising thing was that it is NOISY. On the lowest setting it's not to bad, but it makes sound as it comes on and goes off, and on the middle setting it's like being beside a street fan... to loud to have life go on around it unnoticed.We have now had it about 3 weeks and it is rattling when it comes on... so we will now look into returning it."
3,Serves it's purpose.,"Disappointed with tank; have to refill frequently. Large console with only a 2.5 water container. Have to keep on low; too noisy if operated on higher fan speeds. When I received unit, the front had marks on it. Too busy to return, so I'm stuck with it. I recommend shopping for a more efficient unit.."
4,Quality appearance,"I chose this Essick for the second time in 15 years for several reasons, one it out proforms all the others on the market, second it last forever and third the price has continued to remain reasonable. This one has only one bottle whereas my older one had two bottles, which requires filling more frequently, but it does provide the same preformance as my old one. My only negative opinion would be the length of the pressure arm, it should extend down into the slot at least another quarter or half inch. I say that because when reinserting the filled water bottle back into the console sometimes the presure stick does not go back into the hole properly. You then have to reach in under the filter to reinsert the stick."
4,Nice looking unit and works good!,"This is the second one I ordered. The first arrived with a crack about a foot long in the back right corner. There was no packing material in the box and I was concerned about ordering a replacement. I did get a replacement and very quickly, luckily it arrived in perfect condition. The unit functions quite well. The only thing that I don't like it the refill for the bottle is on the end so you have to use a hose (included) to refill it. This makes it difficult to fill at the sink so now I have to fill it in the tub. That may not be convenient for others. All in all its a good unit but only time will tell how long the motor will last. Mine has to run 24 hrs. a day from October to May, we will see if it can foot the bill."
3,Inferior parts,"Rec'd the product yesterday and assembled it. The wick lasted about 5 minutes. The frame around the wick has weak tabs to keep it all in place and the top part of the frame wouldn't stay locked. As a result, the wick is loose from its frame now and the wet paper wants to fall out. Very badly made. I had to use duct tape to keep the frame in place. Ridiculous. Also, one of the wheels wouldn't stay in. I used aluminum foil in the hole and locked the wheel in. The unit itself is working great but someone has to address this chincy wick for pete's sake."
2,Sad,"This item might work great, if it ever arrived in one piece. After several years of using Amazon, this was the first item I've ever had to return for being defective, and I had to do so twice. Both times it was for the same defect: a seriously cracked shell. The packaging is clearly insufficient as is the quality of material."
2,I wish Dyson made a humidifer,"Although I didn't pay a ton of money for it, I don't think it's unreasonable to expect the casters to stay in place once inserted. I'm going to keep a watchful eye on this baby, because from what I've seen so far...it wouldn't surprise me one bit if it suddenly decides to empty its bladder all over my floor."
1,Piece of CRAP do not buy!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Do not buy this-it is a piece of CRAP!Very cheaply made. And very hard to fill. The one water bottle has one opening at the end and the bottle is too long to easily fit in the kitchen sink to fill from the spigot. Yes, they did provide an attachment with a hose to fit over the spigot nozzle but unless you have a specific very old style spigot, the attachment will not fit. I then tried to fit the bottle in the bathtub to fill from the bathtub spigot. Again the bottle is too long to fit straight up and down. And besides, the bottle opening for filling is so small that it will take forever to fill, while trying to hold it sideways while it fills. When I tried to fill it faster, tons of water were wasted by water spilling out the sides of the small opening.A total waste of money-I should have stuck with the Sears / Kenmore!!!!"
2,Broken after 1.5 years.,"Bought this about a year and a half ago. On anything but low it was fairly loud when it was new -- on high it was as loud as any air conditioner I've ever heard. But after about a year it started getting louder -- the spindle that the fan is on started becoming loose, and about a month ago it's just become deafening and even starting to smell like it's rubbing and will start to burst into flame or something. I mean this is just a large box that holds water and a wick you have to replace -- the fan is the only thing to it! And for it to be bad this quickly (but naturally far outside of the warranty period...) is just a sign of poor product, especially for the price you pay."
1,Filters are a pain,"I would avoid this product. The humidistat on the unit was busted, and it took two successive motor units from the manufacturer to find one that worked correctly.At high speed, the fan rattled way too much. Noise was excessive.The filters for these units are big, and expensive. And if you have hard water, you'll be very lucky to get a month's use out of them.You'll go broke on filters alone."
1,looks attractive but...,"We moved to a climate that is VERY dry so were looking for a humidifier. Ordered this and it worked sporadically at first, but then died completely after about 6 weeks. It looks good but doesn't work."
2,Cabinet isn't cracked and works,"Unlike some of the other reviews, my cabinet isn't cracked but it is so beat up and scratched I am hiding it in a corner. It works so I will live with it. Cost too much to ship it back. It does not appear to have been the packaging that caused the problem. I believe it was packed in this shape. Very sad."
4,Good,"The book is of very good quality, good examples of back quier techniques can be used in many fine art photographs in photoshop.However, in many cases the author does not explain very well, lacking a bit of teaching. Not all users have the same level of knowledge on all subjects covered. I am a teacher and I know what that is.Anyway it was a good buy, recommend."
4,excellent information on Osiris,"The legend of Osiris says he was murdered by his brother Seth and resurrected, with the aid of his wife Isis, thus becoming god of the underworld. The author believes he is one of the most important ancient Egyptian deities, with his origins in the Predynastic Era. He attempts to establish a relationship between the cult of Osiris and other African religions. In the first volume, he examines iconographies of Osiris in general and interprets Osiris as an ancestral spirit, judge of the dead, moon god and a bull god. In the second volume, the focus is on the funeral and burial practices, the idea of the Ka, and also the spread of Osiris and Isis to neighbouring lands. Although the book is a little out-dated, it remains nonetheless an excellent source of information regarding the ancient Egyptian god Osiris.The book receives four stars, simply because there are other books on Osiris which contain more recent information."
2,"IF IT ISN'T BROKEN, DON'T FIX IT!","Having taught from the seventh edition of this textbook for over five years in my clinical math classes, I was dismayed to find that it was no longer available. It was an excellent textbook.I have been using this newer edition for the past two weeks and am very disappointed in it. A lot of the important information has been omitted from the book and it is full of errors. It is difficult enough trying to teach these students math without having to deal with an inferior book. I've had to supplement with other materials just to cover the basics that I feel the students need. I never had to do that with the seventh edition.The former edition was wonderful! Why the authors and/or publishers felt the need to change it, I will never understand. If you have a good product, you leave it alone. I do not like this new edition and will be finding a replacement for it as soon as possible."
1,It's not Exactly what I expected....1,"Not to say that i was pretty disappoited when I first heard this album. The guy ( Kenny Dykes) play great guitar, but somewhere along the line he forgot to put his soul in to his playing. The best words I have to say about this album is that they did a decent recording of ""Fullmoon on mainstreet"""
3,Hardly practical but quite alluring in its own way,Read this to understand one human's attempts to know the mind of the universe. Don't read this if you want some kind of instruction on how to develop your own connection to that Intelligence. A pretty book nonetheless.
4,Great read,This is my first time reading Thoreau and I really enjoyed it. It's really a simple book of him describing a canoe trip that he took in Maine but he describes the trip so well that I felt I was along for the journey.
3,Just Ok,If you need a plug to connect a series of serial cables together this is your part. However if your converting null modem cable or a non-standard end the extra nut on one side are going to cause you issues.
2,Cheaply made,"Pros: Well, it does work.Cons: Overall flimsy construction. Fill hole on water buckets are on end, so bucket cannot be filled directly from tap. Small hose, provided, must be used. Hose made to fit on 'most' faucets, but only those with very simple aerator. I had to buy a new aerator and install it on my bathroom faucet. Hose arrived folded, so it has kinks which restrict water flow. Hole caps are small, cheap, and easily cross thread, often resulting in leaks. I also have an older Holmes unit, which is smaller, about half the price, better made, and probably puts as much water into the air."
1,Essick Air 697-500 Variable Speed Humidifier,"I purchase this based on written reviews by others, I should have focused more on 1 and 2 star rating opinions rather than 4 and 5 star rating reviews. I had this humidifier for a good month now. I don't mind the plastics ins and outs of this humidifier, but I really haven't seen a difference on my house. I had it in main floor, kitchen/living/dinning/family rooms and 2nd floor with 4 bdrms, but I wasn't able to tell the difference before and after. My family and I still have dryed lips and skins. It is very noisy at mid to high speed, unable to bear the sound at night to sleep. But if you leave it at low, I would think it would be less effective, which I believe is not much effective anyway at high speed. Positive - wheels on the bottom, which enables move the humidifier freely in non-carpeted floors, but if you have carpet, the wheels are not helpful."
4,Does the job,"I am pleased with how it looks. I find the two water bottles on the size simple to fill. We have found it helpful with the dry air of the winter season. It is rather noisy when the fan is running on high, but I have not used a humidifier that isn't loud at that speed. We turn it to high during the nighttime hours when the family is sleeping and turn it down low to avoid the noise during the evening."
5,Good book,"This book includes almost everything that need to be considered in simulating the semiconductor processing, especially the CVD process and crystal growth. Perfect!"
4,thr truth,I love gold old spellcaster might so spell counters are lame with me. i know ever one says you need them well you don't. the only cards that i keep are skilled dark magician and the strong monsters and some spells maybe some traps. so dont wast room in your deck with monsters that are destroyed in one turn
4,Good Beginner Race Set,"I found this is not a bad toy for children who enjoy Hot Wheels and other fast toy cars. The review above is just not true. Any toy can be broken if handled incorrectly, and the directions are fine. This toy is no longer sold in Wal-Mart, Target, etc. because Corgi has taken it out of mass stores, and placed it in smaller retailers because of deep discounting practices. This is not an expensive item at $20 or less, but other larger retailers want to bottom it out making it not worth producing. Purchase this item with confidence, and don't pay any attention to those who just wanted to be too rough with their toys."
4,Delightfully romantic with a twist,"Eminently readable and filled with mystery and romance. As with all good stories, the hero is handsome and strong; however, this hero has a wolfish side to him, which adds some spice to the standard romance recipe. It works well with the heroine, who is a wolf researcher. Coincidence? No, and that's what makes it interesting."
4,Great read,"Susan Krinard is a great writer of historic supernatural romance. Her books all start out slowly with lots of detail. Sometimes they seem to lag a bit, but 1/2 - 2/3 of the way into the book, she really kicks them into high gear. There are two books to this Val Cache series, but I am reading her other books as well and am enjoying them too.Allie"
2,boring,Well I was really excited about this book. The cover is wonderful and the back made it sound exciting. It wasn't. It took me days to get through this book. I had to force myself to finish it. I was very disapointed in this story. The characters were glossed over. There was no real passion between the main characters. It wasn't very exciting and the ending just kinda left you hanging. I was hoping it would get better and it just didn't. Hopefully her other books will thrill me.
1,I had to put it down,"I finished Chapter 2 and had to put it down before I fell asleep. It's rich in detail, but there's too much detail. This was the first book of her's that I've read and I was reluctant to pick up another, but I have - Prince of Wolves - and it's much better."
1,if only I could rate this less than one star...,"I saw this guy perform live (10/12/08) and was intrigued when I found that he actually sold his so-called ""act"". Never before in my life have I felt so embarrassed for someone else. The crickets where screaming. It's hard to believe that someone so marginally talented could even consider making an attempt to capitalize on this product. I highly recommend saving your hard earned dollars for something worth while.P.S. he stole the album title from the book ""Words of Mass Destruction"" written by Edina Gottlieb Frankel & Leo Gottlieb"
2,Would no recommend,"I would not recommend reading this book. It was published in the early 1960's. Some of the material is dated. There are other, more recent books that will better serve the reader. There is also a section of the book that is historically incorrect and terribly biased. In my opinion, this book has past its time."
4,Great Set,"I always enjoyed the fragrance of the Calvin Klein product line, for the price it was a fair deal. I did not like the Obsession night product with the set, the fragrance was to feminine, thats why this product only got 4 stars...."
1,BUYER BEWARE!,"I had such high hopes for this CD....the previews sounded good, and the prospect of an album from a band with Reb Beach and Kip Winger was what made be bite.......but buyer beware! This is NOT a ""band "" album. It is essentially a solo album by Cenk Eroglu......and a weak one at that. Reb Beach's contribution is a single guitar solo. Kip Winger's contribution is background vocals and bass on one song, and one of his songs is on the album......THAT's IT! If you have heard any of the 1 minute sound clips on the web, you have heard it all. Not much to like here.....at all!"
5,Fantastic,"Ordered these at a great price, arrived just in time, installation was simple yet fast, and just used them for 30 mins the other day in some medium to light rain and they work perfect, no streaks just wipes and its clear. i am glad i bought these."
4,Happy Camper - Mostly,"Installed easily, works great. Original liftgate action was restored - couldn't be happier with the quality of the part.Was disappointed that a new set of pins and keepers for the top mount were not included. These are flimsy pieces that aren't meant for re-use. After some fussing, I managed to re-install the old hardware - but I'm going to order a new set from the dealership to finish the job right. These are low-dollar items, and should have been included. If they had, installation time would have been cut in half."
3,Spirit was willing....,"After the series of low-fi Cleaners from Venus albums (and not forgetting The Brotherhood of Lizards)and his two solo albums, I found Spirit Cage to be a little disappointing. Perhaps it's the return to low-fi sound or the lack of musical flourishes. The arrangements are spare.Still, Martin has a gift and even lesser Newell is better than 90% of the stuff on the radio. What makes Newell unique is his willingness to go it alone and rejection of radio convention. Stocked to the brim with hooks SC manages to transcend its limitations. As a pop songwriter Newell has very few peers (Andy Partridge, Jason Falkner, Neil Finn and Aimee Mann all are comparable to Newell when he's at his best)and even if SC isn't as compelling or powerful as TLE or The Offwhite Album it still has its moments."
1,"Terri from Springfield, MO","Unless your a beginner to exercise, don't waste your money. This is a totally cheesy, too easy DVD. This DVD should be on a discount rack. I can't believe it cost $25.00. The release date said 2006, but it was made it 1991 and video quality shows it. There is no title menu for different options or workouts. This DVD showed me nothing new. Do your own crunches and leg lifts and save 25 bucks. I expected the instructor on a phenomenal ab video to show some abs, not be dressed in an oversized T-shirt and shorts to her knees. Maybe I'm being too picky, but what a total disappointment. I'm going to try and get a refund."
3,A Mixed Bag,"I was not sure whether I should give this book one star or five, so I compromised at three. On the plus side, the book contains a tremendous amount of information, far more than other books on reflexology that I have read. It is evident that the book was written by a gifted practitioner with a wealth of knowledge. On the minus side, the book could use some massive editing. For example, some critical terms are not defined, illustrations often do not appear on the same page as the related text, and it frequently is necessary to flip back and forth between different sections of the book to develop a full understanding of what you need to know. For a reader with sufficient patience, this book will be extremely useful and rewarding. For anyone else, it will be frustrating."
2,Wach out . . . .,"Watch out for this item. I bought this cap for my brothers car which has an external ignition coil and the product info says it will fit all make and models yet it'll only fit Hondas with an HEI ignition coil setup. Hei ignition setup's are where the ignition coil is internally mounted under the distributor cap. BTW the cap wasn't translucent black when it came, it was solid black. If this product fits your car it's a real deal considering caps for the cars that this product fits to are over $20.00."
1,Wogan 1803 Peruvian Letters,"The only copy known to me is at Austin, U. of Texas. I'd be glad to know where this edition came from.The text has been censored because of ""Aza's mistaken and false opinion of the dogmas of Christianity"" (I, p. 45).The uniqueness of the copy and the censoring of a letter constitute the interest of this edition.DWS"
2,Pretty but incapable of liquefying,"I have plenty of high end items around the house and have generally been pleased with Kitchen Aid. I only use a blender to make mixed drinks; a few cubes of ice and several strawberries are more than this thing can handle. Whether I pulse or not, or let it run for 3 minutes, it can't get the berries small enough to go through a bar straw and whenever I have a party, I secretly blend in a $[...] glass Oyster in about 25 seconds and pour it into the Kitchen Aid so my friends will be impressed when I serve up the libations..."
4,Another fine Tom T Hall Album(s),"Here is another fine release by Bear Family Records. While best known for their immense and comprehensive Box Sets, this Bear Family release covers two classic, though lesser known, Tom T Hall albums. There are 22 fine numbers here, though none that really hit it big on the charts as earlier and later albums would provide. Still, the songwriting and storytelling are outstanding, as only Tom could provide. If I have one criticism, these two albums seemed to introduce a little more of the ""preachy"" side of Mr Hall. Still, this is easily overlooked (and overheard) with other outstanding songs, such as ""I Hope It Rains at my Funeral"" and ""Thank You Connellsville"". Great sound, and an even better set of liner notes."
4,Works perfectly for it's job,"Great design on the case. Holds my 18V cordless saw, 2 batteries, and a charger. Has a blade storage section in the bottom of the case below the saw. Even has a slot in the lid to store the available rip fence. It is deeper than you'd expect, as another reviewer noted.1 star off for 2 things. First, the blade storage has a post molded into the bottom of the case - but the nut that screws the blades down was missing when I got it. A call to the Milwaukee tech line (their general support line had no indication of this part) got me 2 mailed out immediately. Second, unlike the sawzall and drill cases, there is no slot for the manual. Not a big deal since I don't even refer to the manual and could just chuck it, but I do prefer to keep them with the tools. Right now it's folded in half and shoved in the spare battery section.Definitely does it's intended job."
1,Bad Choice,Trying to get my Milwaukee 6310 cordless circular saw to work in this case is like putting together a zig saw puzzle. I hate it.
3,OK for the price,"Definitely doesn't last as long as the original Canon batteries, however, for the price, it'll work. I ordered two and one seems to hold a charge longer than the other."
3,Battery Life,I am not sure but it seems that this battery does not last as long as the original battery. But it was much cheaper.
2,Overheats,"Bought this for my old S410. After using the camera for 5 minutes or so, the battery will begin to overheat. (You can actually feel the heat of the battery while holding the camera) This never once happened while using the official Canon battery. I ignored it, but the heat began to affect the sensor of the camera, resulting in warped and pixelated shots. Interesting looking, but probably not so great for the lifespan of the camera.(NB I gave it 2 stars because I got what I paid for. Can't expect too much for $10)"
1,wrong size,"I have a cannon camera and I put in the camera type and the size of battery already in the camera. The description stated that it would fit my camera and when it arrived it did not, it was the wrong size."
5,*** Exactly as I expected!! ***,I had struggled with the original batteries not keeping a charge for a long time! I finally had the courage to try a non-OEM battery and I COULD NOT BE HAPPIER!! Frustrated with myself that I took this long to make this decision! THANK YOU!! *<|:{)>
2,Not the battery as advertised,"The battery received was not the brand name Ultralast which the company advertised for sale, but some un-labeled, no upc code, probably Chinese nockoff. I emailed seller and they agreed to return it but not worth the hassle to me. After reading lots of reviews I chose SF Planet to purchase from hoping to get the Ultralast brand, I was wrong."
1,cheap but useless,"This replacement battery is cheap, but not worth the price. It did not last more than 2-3 cycles of recharging in my Canon camera."
1,Totally unusable,"Charged the battery when I received it. Put it in my Canon Power Shot S410, and the camera reported a battery problem. Reset the battery, and the camera accepted it, but it was drained after 5 minutes of use, maybe 3 photos. I had bought the Canon battery at the same time because I was worried about this no-name battery, and had no problems. Amazon should not offer this product. They did refund the full amount and made it easy to return the product, but still a hassle."
5,Ultralast UL camera battery,Great item. Working great. Purchased one from Battery Plus. Worked less than a week. Highly recommon.
2,Half satisfied,This battery only takes a half charge powering about 30 photos of around 450 kbs. Don't know if the problem is the charger or not as the original battery used to record about 75 photos.
2,A Parcel of Boredom,"Review of `A Parcel of Patterns.' `A Parcel of Patterns' is a historical novel, it is set in a Derbyshire village at the time of the plague. The story is told by Mall, a teenager living in Eyam. The pace is slow and therefore it takes a long time to get into the story.The language in the book is extremely challenging as it uses Old English. There are words such as `wakes' that are seldom used now and make the story very confusing.The story line is uninteresting until very near the end, when it begins to get more dramatic. The events described are a little too detailed and become tedious.Overall I did not enjoy the book, as it is not what I would normally read. I would prefer a book set from World War II to the Millennium."
4,Direct and concise,"I enjoyed this book immensely because my formal supervisor has the book. I was very interested to get and to see what I can get out from it. It really help me learned how to write letters, memos, and reports at any situation without seaches high words that I can impress people. The langauge of words, phases, and sentences is clear and to the point. You can even learned basic part of grammar at appendenix section. Now I can write without having a mental block. I can definitely use this book for government projects and administrative assignments. Thanks for your help."
2,too hard to read,"i bought this book for help in writing letters and how to say the right thing...but i found this book very hard to follow. it did, however, have useful phrases. there are no examples in letter form, but written in paragraphs. it would have been easier to follow if the author had actual letters for reference."
5,Bellybra,"I bought this for my daughter and she absolutely loves this product, so I am glad I got her the right gift"
2,helps with the belly...,"this does help with a light lift of your belly, but i was hoping it be more like shape wear. i also want to wear a bra with it, it does not flatter your chest."
3,So So,"It helped a bit, but the cinched part under the bust starts to irritate after awhile. It would make it kinda sore, so it was trading one soreness for another."
4,good support!,"This belly bra gives great support for the tummy and is very comfortable. However, if you have wide scoop neck or v neck tops, beware because the neckline is narrow, and the belly bra will show inside your top's neckline. Good product for wintertime esp when you are wearing turtlenecks etc."
2,"great idea, but it hurts my belly","The bottom part makes my belly hurt and cramp a little. Otherwise, I like it. I do have a long torso, so maybe it fits better if you have an average or short torso."
1,too tight,My daughter is a small person so i ordered a small...way too tight so I had to sent it back
5,Just as it promises....,"This is the one time when thinking ""inside the box"" is a good thing! When it comes to a business plan, you can lose your mind writing page after page after page after page of endless nonsense. Having the directive to focus and get it all on one page when armed with successful instructions is priceless."
4,Simple and does the job,I have several texts and templates for writing business plans and have written a number of very long and complicated business plans. I wish I would have come across this book sooner. Jim Horan has a way of distillingthe jungle of information that needs to be researched and thought through to the core and most important elements providing a very clear picture of the business vision both for the writer of the plan and any investors.Highly recommend.
5,Simply Wonderful,"I had some experience with business plans before starting my own company, however I was overwhelmed when starting the process for my own business. This book changed all of that. Not because it was easier to get my entire plan into a brief document (it wasn't) but because its effectiveness exceeded my expectations. In my approach to several angel investors, the document made the process and subsequent discussions a lot simpler, and allowed us to close a financing much sooner than I had expected. Although I was prepared (and had started to write) a traditional business plan, it was never necessary. The short version did it. While I can't say that the author's approach is for everybody and every type of enterprise, there's little doubt that the book can be helpful to most anyone contemplating (or in the process of) writing a plan. I found this book to be well written and accessible. Highly recommended."
1,Terrible Quality Book,"I am giving this book a poor review because of the quality of the construction. I left this book in my car the other day and when I returned, the book literally had fallen apart, the binding was destroyed. The car didn't even get very hot (only 50 degrees outside that day)!!! Now I paid $35 for a stack of loose paper... DISAPPOINTING!"
3,The perfect third leg,"I like to think that life is like an old wooden stool I got in Blaine, MO. It rests on three legs: Truth, beauty, and the money to obtain the first two.If ""Chicken Soup for the Soul"" is the truth that guides you each morning, and if you found beauty in the remarkable riddles of ""The Da Vinci Code"", then this book is the third leg you've been looking for."
1,Save your money people - I care!,Too much detailed information left out. Nothing but mumbo jumbo. Be careful.
5,"Simple, Simple, Simple!","Your Business Vision, Mission Statement, Objectives, Markerting Strategies, and Plans... OH MY! Can you think of anything more overwhelming to a potential or new business owner than the thought of putting all that down on paper? Jim Horan has created an easy to understand and enjoyable --- yes, I said enjoyable ---book that will assist you as you create that solid foundation for your business. Once you have completed ""The One Page Business Plan"" you have in your hand, the basis of your brochure or web page or networking and marketing plan. What more can a New Business Owner ask for!"
4,Provides good ideas for creating a business road map,"I've read a fair amount on how to write a business plan, and for me, this book has been the most helpful. It is a straightforward, concise book that clearly describes the sections of the author's version of a business plan. The author provides many examples to illustrate the sections, and worksheets to help the reader develop their thoughts on what should be in their business plan. The business plan presented in this book is very good as an informal tool for anyone who is starting a business."
5,"Accurate, Measurable, Focused","If you want to really focus on your business, then I recommend this book. The exercises enable you to concentrate on the plan in your mind and help you place it on paper. I had an instructor in high school who encouraged us to remove the ""fluff"" and get to the point. This book certainly helps you accomplish the task and helps you produce a tangible document that is accurate, measurable, and focused."
4,Simplifies business plan writing,Strong foundation for writing a business plan. Very easy to read. Very concise information. A tremendous resource for business planning. Simplifies things very well. I highly recommend.
1,So Cute! Until Your Feet Begin to Bleed.,"And that is not a good look! I loved how these shoes looked, and Steve Madden usually makes a reasonably comfortable shoe. I bought them to wear with dark brown pants, and they looked adorable - I got a million compliments. Sadly, those compliments were not enough to take my mind off of my blistered, bleeding feet. I had to wear big, clompy flats for a week following an eight-hour day in these. If you are into masochism, don't care about the health and welfare of your tootsies, or are looking for a quick way to gangrene and amputation, these are the shoes for you."
1,OUCH OUCH OUCH!,"I initially purchased these shoes because they were stylish and affordable. Once I wore them, however, my feet hurt instantaneously. I wish that I could send them back."
2,Bemis Humidifier 427300,I used this humidifier for 1 season with no problems. The second season the fan motor stopped working. Not impressed.
5,My skin thanks me for buying this.,"While it throws out cooler air, it helps to heat the house better with the humidity it creates. I spent two days in a home with no humidifier and my skin just dried out so badly. This is a great product to have in the house. HOWEVER, the lights to indicate the tanks are empty to do not come on...until you open the top and pull them out. ;) I find I need to fill the tanks every day and a half or so. LARGE tanks. The hose to fill it does not fit our sink so I use a funnel and use that in the kitchen sink...works like a charm!"
4,Does the job,I bought this model because it holds two water containers. I had been using the model that only had one and had to refill it frequently. This model only has two speeds and high is a little loud. A medium speed like the other model I have would be nice. Other than that it functions well.
1,"Wow, is this bad","I love the animated version of this and when I saw there was a live-action one I thought, ""hey--John Goodman, Michael McKean, Harvey Fierstein, how bad can it be?"" Really, really bad. When puppets from the early 70s have more charisma than the actors do, something is really wrong with your movie. This could have been good but it never quite figures out if it wants to be an homage, a parody, or a ""hip"" update. Between that and Chris Kattan chewing up all the scenery--just spend your money on the original."
1,One star is charitable.,"The Year Without a Santa Claus has been my favorite Christmas movie since I was a little girl. When I heard they were doing a live action version, I'll admit I didn't expect greatness. I thought it might be laughably bad, maybe a cute homage to the original, but that was it. Instead what I got was a movie so completely awful that I couldn't finish watching it. The flaws in the first half hour were too numerous to count, but the one thing that I consider to be the absolute worst was the way Iggy's father is represented. In the original movie he's a nice man, a good father, and he still believes in Santa Claus. In this version he's neglectful and more or less a jerk. It was around that part when I decided that I had better things to do.Do yourself a favor and just watch the original."
1,Why Remake Beloved Holiday Masterpieces?,This film is yet another lame attempt to redo what need not be redone. Go see the original and forget that this piece of trash was ever greenlit!
2,boring,This movie in general is boring. Everyone forgot how to act and played it way too campy for my liking.
4,Island on the Bay,"""Island on the Bay"" begins with a lot action and continues that way throughout the entire novel. The story ""clicked"" immediately and I became very involved with its characters. It never lacked in excitment and was very inspiring in that it told the story of a self-consumed young man who learned that there's more to life than just himself. He struggles along the way, but is moved by the people he meets. There's even a good lesson in forgiveness as you hear the story about the town ""bully"".Being a new resident of the Eastern Shore, I was fascinated with the history Mr. Cooper revealed in his story and excited by the fact that it actually took place in my own back yard. His writing is superb, very descriptive and sensitive. It's wonderful to pick up a book and feel inspired the whole time you are reading it -- very worthwhile reading."
5,This book is a gem.,"The recipes have given me and my friends great enjoyment over the years. My favorites are two super easy, super good, no-cook ones: strawberry ice cream with balsamic vinegar, and pistachio. Friends are just amazed how good these ice creams are, and even more amazed at how easy they are to make. Reading the book is a pleasure in itself; it is obviously the authors' labor of love, and their joy to share. I have used this book non-stop since it was first published in the UK in 1995 (it had two reprints in the same year, and five more reprints since then). This book makes a great gift for anyone who loves good food and who is interested in what makes something good."
4,Great book for serious ice cream makers,Thid book teaches you the basics of making ice cream at home. The recipes are not simple to make (like for example in Ben & Jerry's book) but are precise and seem to be well tested by the authors. The ice creams that I've made were the best home-made ice creams that I've tasted.This is a book for the serious home ice cream makers.
3,I enjoyed reading about the history and details of ices,"I collect cookbooks and am always interested in the ""definitive"" book on a subject. I found this to be a good reference type book on ices. Although I wasn't really excited to try any of the recipes. The book is written with measurements in metric, U.S. and Imperial and I always make large recipes and these just are convenient for increases.For me, this cookbook falls more under the good read or interesting fact type of book and not the dogged-eared love to use book. It is interesting to read a book from 2 English cooks points of view.Ben & Jerry's Icecream and Dessert book is an easier book to actually use."
1,"Hey, this is America","If I had the option, I would give this book only a 1/2 star. I agree wholeheartedly with other reviewers: this book is written, organized and intended for a British/European audience. This would be fine, except that it was never made clear in the descriptions of the book. There are many recipes that are interesting, but as a chef, I can look at them and know that they will not work. Ingredients for many of the recipes are obscure, to say the least, probably only available outside the US. It's a curious and quaint book, but of absolutely no use to me personally or professionally. I WISH I'D READ ALL OF THE CUSTOMER REVIEWS AND READ THEM CAREFULLY, but mostly, I wish I'd bought the Williams-Sonoma book."
4,Pretty Good,"More than just a recipe book, this guide lays out the history of ices and goes into amazing detail. I still haven't made any of the recipes, but I will soon. I'm especially interested in bay leaf ice cream."
1,Not for me,I bought this CD for a friend of mine to replace it as her friend had lost it when she borrowed it. I know nothing of the CD. Not my kind of music.
5,The glasses are great!!,I have been looking for this particular pair of glasses on the Gucci website and they were no longer available. They are exactly what I was looking for and saved a lot of money. I never thought of looking on Amazon for sunglasses but I will check here first from now on.
3,Not bad,"Music is such a personal thing. These guys are a little different in the country genre, all clever and clearly talented musicians, but not all the tracks worked for me. I had read some other reviews and impulsively bought two CDs at one time, but had I listened to either one first I would probably not have bought the second. I don't mind hearing them now and again but I seldom bother, and they're not on my portable MP3 player despite that fact that the 40GB is not full - so that tells a story. But hey, I guess I'm not their target audience, though I am a session musician (well, singer anyway) myself, folk, country, rock, celtic, etc."
4,Captures the Golden Age,"This is a fun and spirited novel. I read this work and saviored its passionate journey into the essence of whitewater rafting and kayaking through wonderful and vivid descriptions of the river and landscape. So too, I felt like I entered Two Dog River and passed through the Golden Age of ""boating."" I am not aware of any other work of fiction as such. I especially enjoyed the full-bodied characters and rich depiction of boys becoming men. Also, buried deep within all the action is a hidden Spirit and higher calling. Once I got about a third of the way into ""The Dog,"" I was gripped to the end (and up late at night finishing it!) Enjoy!!"
2,Images and Shadow's,"After reading War in Val d'Orica I was anxious to read more of her books.This was a great disappointment, she spent half of the book on endless details of her relatives and complaining about her shallow privileged life. The chapter on Writing was dull and the book didn't become interesting till page 199.I am happy I did not buy more of her books.Pat Sica"
5,I wish you could buy them separately,"I gave this 5 stars for the quality of the product. I thoroughly enjoyed listening to these CDs. Two of them were old favorites from records, ""Christmas on the Ponderosa"" and Lorne Greene's ""Welcome To The Ponderosa."" I had already purchased the Christmas CD so basically I bought this set for the CD ""Welcome To The Ponderosa"" which made it quite expensive for the one CD I wanted! I'm happy to report though after listening to all CDs that I'm sure they'll become old favorites in time and I don't regret the purchase at all. All cast members do a phenomenol job of singing or just plain telling the story to music. If you're a fan of Bonanza you'll love these CDs."
4,Very comfortable but they become too loose.,"I found these to be very comfortable, even with heel spurs. I wear them around the house instead of slippers. After wearing them for a few weeks, though, the fabric strip between the toes became too loose and now they don't fit as well."
3,Yoga Mat Shoes,"These are moderately priced and comfortable flips. The yoga mat material is a little questionable in terms of comfort, in that it's rubbery feeling and conducive to sweating. It's squishy, so squishy that it doesn't offer much resistance when I put my weight down to take a step. It feels as though there should be a stronger layer under the top layer of squishy fun.Also, these run a little narrow. I typically wear a 7 1/2 or an 8, depending on the brand, I got these in an 8 and they fit snugly.Overall, 3 stars because they aren't super expensive, seem well made and fairly durable, but the yoga mat material isn't at all absorbent and a bit too squishy."
5,Makes a great gift!,I bought these for my mom because I loved them so much for myself..... she loves them! VERY comfy sandals! Definitely recommend to anyone! I have narrow feet and they fit great.
1,Loyal Customer- SO Disappointed!!!!,So disappointed. My 5th pair of these flip flops. Every other pair has been worn DAILY for up to two years. Had these for less than two weeks & they are already starting to flake on the tops and around the edges. Did Sanuk change the way these were made???? Or are these just a defective pair? I used to say they were worth every penny and raved about them but now I'm not so sure I will recommend them or spend any more cash on another pair.
2,Comfy but too tight,"After looking at all the positive reviews, I decided to get one. I usually wear size 5.5 - 6 so I ordered size 6. When I tried them on, it felt so tight. It's very comfy but the strap is so tight on my feet I can't wear these anymore. I can't order size 7 b/c then it will be too long for my feet. I would not recommend this flip flop unless you can try them on before you buy them."
3,Run Small,"This is my wives 2nd pair of sanuks and they must have changed manufacturer, they are about 1/2"" smaller than my previous pair. So sad, i'm afraid to order the next size up...but they use to be fantastic"
3,cushy but...,"were not as cushy as i thought they would be, and the strap across the top just rubbed me the wrong way. i'll stick to my Reefs i guess. i wish they would make these yoga mat flops with nylon straps instead of the leathery synthetic kind.i guess the main reason i didn't like them was they aren't water friendly. what's the point of owning flip flops that you can't wear to the pool or beach?"
5,Sanuk sandals rock,These are the most comfortable flip flop type sandal out there. They fit well and the yoga mat bottom feels great. I've worn and walked in them for hours without any discomfort. I wish I could get them in every color available.
2,Dissatified,"I sent these sandals back the day I received them. They run small, and the straps across the top of my foot was very tight. Ordered a larger size and had to send them back as well- they were to big, however the straps were still tight. My foot is average size, so not sure why the straps were so tight on my foot. Had they fit correctly, I would have loved them, as they are super comfortable. I wanted to like them!!"
2,Not as good as they used to be?,"I wear the same size shoes as my sister in law. When I borrowed her Sanuk sandals I *had* to get some for myself they were so comfortable. The Sanuk sandals that I received seem to have been made out of a different material, they just were not as comfortable. The biggest problem is that they were smaller. I had my sister in law bring hers over and set them sole to sole, the ones I received in the same exact size were smaller, most noticeably narrower. The strap was also not as roomy or comfortable. I returned these sandals."
5,Soft and Comfortable,"I have not had these for very long, but so far these are probably the most comfortable sandals I've worn. They are extremely soft on the foot, which may lead to untimely wear and a change in rating later, and the strap that goes between the toes is also very comfortable. For now I would absolutely recommend these to others."
5,Love these flip flops.,This is my third pair of Sanuk yoga mat flip flops. I absolutely love how comfortable they are. Please do NOT stop making them. I wear them all summer long.
5,Best flip flops EVER,I bought a pair of these flip flops when I was pregnant at a skate store and they were the most comfortable flip flops I have ever worn in my life. That was 4 years ago and my pair just recently broke. So I was very excited when I found these on amazon and bought them IMMEDIATELY. best decision ever.
4,One of the most comfortable flip flops,"These are one of the most comfortable, soft, light, affordable, pain-free flip flops I have ever worn. After wearing them all summer, my feet did not hurt and with each step I took, they were cushioned with the yoga mat material. The only downside is that the thong part tends to get loose between the dorsum of the foot and loses its conformity. Other than that, they are great and if/when they fall apart, I will purchase another one."
5,great flip flops,Everyone needs a pair of these flip flops.....It's hard to take them off my feet......I have never had such comfort in a flip flop shoe.......And all nice colors..........great delivery service.......
5,Tired Feet?,"I love, love, love these sandals. I work at a hospital and am on my feet for 8 hrs solid; when I get home the first thing I go for is my Sanuk's yoga mat sandals. After that any aches in my feet are gone! I can not say enough on the comfort I receive when wearing these sandals and they are so versatile I have both the white and the brown and between the two I can cover almost every outfit I own."
3,Not for a wider foot.,"I loved the color and feel of these sandals but unfortunately, they were too narrow for me and the fit was too snug to be comfortable. I ordered my usual size, but maybe they run small or are designed for a younger person's foot. I'm 59 and have bunions on both feet. I had to send them back."
4,Cute shoe,"While this is a cute shoe and I do like them, they fit weird , no half sizes. Not alot of support either. But for wearing around the house not bad."
4,My Favorite Shoes,"I've had these flippers ( size 9) for about two months. They are great. They never rubbed or bothered my feet in anyway.they have broken down a bit in the sole after constant wear but overall are holding up nicely.They don't offer a whole lot in regard to support, so while comfortable, they don't work well for long distances.I would buy these again (and plan to buy them as a gift for a few different people!)"
4,very good product,"just wish it could have a little more..., a tiny more, a tad more cushion to it.. otherwise, it is a great product... really"
5,Wonderful!,These feel so wonderful! They are true to size and the width is perfect. I wear a 7M but most flip flops seem too wide for my feet so I must lean toward the narrow side. Not sure if this style would work for a wider foot. They do tend to stick to the bottom of your feet which I like but some may not. Each step is a pleasure in these!
5,Sanuk the BEST,This time around I ordered 2 pair (different colors). The first pair was a gift and I wore them everywhere. They have great support and cushion for your heels. Also they fit my narrow feet!
5,so comfy!,"I have these sandals in red and orange, and love them! They are the most comfortable sandals I own, and can walk all day in them. i used them all throughout my pregnancy and now when i go out with my son, and I never have back or knee pain like I used to have with other thinner shoes.They do not do well when wet, and tend to get a little stinky if you do not clean and dry them every so often.The inner part of the straps are made of cloth, and need to be scrubbed once in awhile too to stay clean."
3,Narrow!,They have comfy footbeds but these are much narrower than Reefs. I wouldn't recommend them if your foot is wide.
5,Love these flip flops,"I've wore reefs forever, and decided to give these a try. I just got my second pair in the mail last week. I love these flips flops, they are the most comfortable flips flops I've ever owned. They seem to be holding pretty up very good. I've had one pair for 5 months and they still seem like new. So far they dont have the foot imprint like I get in reefs, but I don't wear them everyday."
2,Not for wide feet...,"They were cute. Unfortunately, I have wide feet. Most flip flops I've gotten have been able to accommodate that with no problem. These, however, let my small toe spill over the edge when I stood in them. Although they are cute and seem to be comfortable when I'm sitting, I'm returning them because they are too narrow to ever be comfortable in any situation where I need to walk."
5,heavenly!!,The most comfortable flip flops I have ever purchased!! I wear and 8.5W and was not sure how these would fit but they were perfect!! Must have!!!
5,Awesome flip flops,"I bought these at Universal Studios in Florida while on vacation. The shoes I was wearing were getting very uncomfortable and they were selling these in a gift shop. LOVE THEM. Not only did I walk all around florida in these, but that was a year ago and they are still awesome. The most comfortable flip flops ever made. I have nothing bad to say about them."
4,Great for relaxing the feet,"You can't compare this flip flop to a Teva,Reef, or a Chaco in terms of functionality...but it definitely is one of the most comfortable flip flops I've worn. Soft, supportive gentle on the foot. I was going to return it because it wasn't quite what I needed but I just couldn't quite part with them. Very worth it!!!"
3,Super comfy and stays clean,"These flip flops are incredibly comfortable to wear due to the spongy 'yoga mat' sole. The white upper stays much cleaner than expected - the thong between the toes is made of a fabric and that grays faster and requires separate care to remain as white. Over long distances (miles) these flip flops remain comfortable but do rub a bit on the bottom of the foot pad leaving the beginnings of blisters. The major drawback to these shoes are that they become incredibly slippery when wet to the point that it was difficult to keep my foot in the shoe while going down stairs in a rain storm. In addition to the slippery wet surface, the sole of the shoe 'bubbles' when wet - literally little white foamy bubbles come up from between the toes at the thong when walking in them wet. So they're fantastic when its dry out and you're not going for much distance."
5,Super Comfortable Flip Flops,These flip flops are amazing! They are super comfortable and fit really well. I didn't experience any of the normal discomfort when breaking in a new pair of flip flops.
3,just okay,"I bought these based on the mostly positive reviews. They are very cushy but I had some issues that will limit my wear of them. For one, the color bleeds when these shoes get wet. Also, have sensitive skin and frequently have problems with flip flops rubbing the skin off the top of my feet, resulting in blisters, which unfort. happened with these. Too bad, in a lot of ways they are good shoes. I especially appreciate that they don't have arch support since I mostly cannot wear shoes with arch support (my feet are narrow and it hits the wrong spot)."
4,So super comfy,"These flip-flops are wonderful! I would absolutely recommend them to anyone. They are the most cushion-y shoes I've ever worn, and they ran very true to size. I'm thinking about getting them in some more colors.UPDATE - One month later, I see/feel a downside. These shoes become treacherous when wet. And, they act as sponges, so it takes a while (2 days for me) to become dry. If you live in a dry climate, see no rain in the future, and can avoid bodies of water, excellent. Otherwise, choose a different shoe."
3,Not What I'd Hoped,"These are cute, but not as comfy as I'd hoped, since they are made of ""yoga mat"" material. I really prefer my Yellow Box 'flops' over these for the sake of comfort. However, they seem sturdy, and I really like the polka dot straps on the inside as they show a bit when worn. I would have also preferred to have had the straps wider."
4,flip flop heaven,Sanuk flip flops are worth every penny. I tried my sister-in-law's and knew I had to have a pair for myself. I like them so much that I will be buying other colors. My only wish is that they have a thicker sole.
4,So comfortable!,Love these flip flops! They are just as described and I also bought them in black. They fit true to size-I am a 7 and the 7 fit well. I recommend these for anyone who wants a flip flop but one that you can wear a lot and be comfortable.
5,very comfortable,"these were the only shoes I wore for 5 days at Disney. They did get very soft in the hot sun, thought they might melt,but didn't. Overall the best flipflops I've ever worn. Very fast shipping. Retailer even called to make sure I was satisfied."
3,"love Sanuks, but...","Love these but, within 5 days of having them they developed a small wear spot by the strap. Drives me nuts because it feels like there is a pebble or something on the black part of flop. Ordered some for my hubby at the same time, his are fine. Should have returned them as defected but just didn't think it was worth the time. Will prob buy another pair come spring and see how they wear."
5,great!,These are great. They are very durable and comfortable. I live a warm climate and wear these every day. My last pair lasted 2 years! Amazing for any sandal I have ever worn>
5,"""Go To"" flip flops","I have terrible feet and I have found the Sanuk Yoga Mat sandals to be the most comfortable . I have them in several colors and even wear them as slippers.The yoga mat sole provides cushioning that allows me to wear them for hours even for long walks at the mall. I would love to have them in beige or tan but so far no go. I keep checking to see which new colors have been added. The key is comfort, comfort , comfort. They are my ""go to"" flip flops for sure."
5,Great Flip Flop,They were shipped quickly and my daughter loves the color and the comfort! She wears them all the time for everyday use. I didn't buy them for Yoga.
5,Comfortable!,These are great flip flops! I already had a pink pair & now I have orange ones too! Very cushiony to walk in
2,Disappointed,I finally decided to order these flip flops after months of indecision. I wasn't sure how I liked the straps. The shoes are sooo comfortable but the sole on the right shoe started to separate within less than a week after purchase. I only wore them to work where I spend the majority of my day behind a desk. This is the second pair of Sanuks that we have bought in our house that had terrible quality. The other pair cost $80. We will not be purchasing any again.
3,Not for walking in hot sand!,"I have owned these flip flops for 8 months now. They are comfortable, sturdy, and still look good, but I do believe that Nike makes a better flip flop. I have owned several Nikes over the years and they are superior. My MAJOR complaint about these Sanuk flip flops is what happens to them when you walk in very hot sand! Within 5 feet, the straps completely stretch and no longer hold the sole close to your foot. This allows an abundance of hot sand to come onto the sole in direct contact with the bottom of my foot; additionally the sole shifts sideways so you foot is in direct contact with the hot sand. I was better off taking them off and running! Weird thing: once they cool, they go back to their original shape. I will never bring these flip flops to the river in Laughlin, NV. I never had this problem even with cheap flip flops."
2,Noisy & defective,"Sure they're very, very cushioned...but they're incredibly noisy! They make that super loud flip flop sound, which seems to be because the straps aren't tight enough. In addition, where the strap attaches to the footbed had come apart on the pair I received; it looked like cheap glue. I sent them back."
5,yes,they are comfy and fit perfectly i absolutely love and recommend them to anyone who likes flip flops also comfy between toes!!!
4,So comfy,"I love these flip flops in the summer. They are hands-down THE most comfortable shoes I've ever worn in my life. I just wish they looked a little cuter, but they work with shorts and casual outfits."
4,A little narrow!,"I don't think I have wide feet- I usually fit into regular shoes happily, and have never noticed anything amiss. With these, I felt suspiciously wide. The sides of my feet weren't spilling off, but they are exactly on the edge! I ordered the brown on brown if that makes a difference.I really like the feel of them and I am pretty sure I'm going to keep them, they're just a bit narrow."
2,not as comfortable as i thought they would be,I thought these shoes would be very comfortable because of the yoga mat bottom but it is not thick enough to cushion your walk.
2,Several Drawbacks,"I bought these flops two years ago because of the great reviews and would never buy them again. The yoga mat material is nice and comfy when you first try them out, but they are not suitable for wearing in any kind of wet environment. The porousness of the material soaks up water like a sponge, causing the shoes to be very slippery and foam up if they get wet. What's worse is that the retained water doesn't dry out easily so the shoes smell funky over time, like old dish sponges. At the beach, the little pores get filled with sand that remains embedded indefinitely. After a year, the shoes looked old and cracked, and so it was time to buy new flip flops."
2,yoga mat flip flop,These shoes are not as comfortable as advertised. Absolutely cannot wear them in or on wet surfaces. They are extremely slippery when wet. A big disappointment
1,too squashy,"My first gripe: I went with the gunmetal gray. It's not gray, it's brown. Second, the ""yoga mat"" footbed has a gooey, gummy feel to it that I do not like. It's practically sticky. I want my flip-flops soft & springy, not gelatinous. These seem to be made of hardened gummy bears, recycled into footwear. I really wanted to like these. It's hard on my self esteem to disagree with so many glowing reviews, but I'll be returning to my old-school, dry foam flip-flops: LL Bean Maine Isles."
3,Good but not great,"Got these flip flops hoping to wear them daily most of the year. I like flip flops that mold to your feet with use and are comfy. The squishy sole on these is nice...at first. It does stay that way with time. I find wearing them all day, the bottoms of my feet get that burning feel similar to walking on hot asphalt barefoot due to some rubbing. Not comfortable and I haven't ever had a flip flop do this. They're fairly heavy for what they are as well and no matter how I walk it makes a ""thwap"" flip flop sound that I have always been able to avoid with other flip flops. So yes, I'd reccomend them but just not for someone looking to practically live in the things."
3,My expectations may have been too high,"After reading all these great reviews I was so excited to get these. Sadly, my expectations were probably too high. They're not that comfortable. Yes, the mat layer is soft but then your feet just sink down onto a hard sole. The mat layer is too thin. For the thinness they're a lot better than others. I'll stick with a my thick sole pair."
2,false advertising,I am in LOVE with Sanuk's...however the pink pair that I ordered show the gem (for balance) or whatever they call it on the side...but when delivered it did not have it & that was the reason I bought that one. I think that was false advertising. DISAPPOINTED!! :(
2,NOT AS PICTURED!!! BEWARE!!!,"Ok. So I am a huge fan of these flip flops. Bought my first pair in a surf shop and love them! Went on line to buy more and found these on Amazon. The pair I bought at the surf shop have the little PEARL button on the side that even though sounds stupid, is really cute and another thing I loved about the flip flops. I ordered another pair of the black and a pink pair as pictured with the pearl button here on Amazon last week. Not sure what is going on, but they came look exactly the same but no pearl button?My gripe is, if you picture something correctly and as shown then you should recieve them as shown."
1,one shoe was super tights,"I have had sanuks before, and I love them. I bought these for my sister's birthday and one shoe is super tight. I am very disapointed because I have raved about them forever. She is definately not sold on sanuks. I will probably only buy them in stores from now on."
2,disapointed,"I ordered a pair of Sanuk thongs. Was sent a confirmation of order, then days later I was told they had a problem with stock and didn't have any like I ordered and would credit my account,Later, I looked on the site and it still said they had 1 pair left. Buyer beware!"
1,Two different size shoes,The shoes are comfortable but they sent two different sizes one was a five the other was a six. Returning only cost you more money. I won't buy shoes from amazon again!
3,"Soft, but little support","I'm always on the search for comfy sandals. I find the majority of sandals to be hard and uncomfortable. My ideal sandal would feel like small tempurpedic mattresses on my feet. At first, the yoga mat is sooo soft and comfortable...exactly the level of cushioning I was hoping for after a week of wearing heels. But after a few days and a few long walks, I start realizing that it's not exactly like walking on clouds anymore. The cushioning quickly flattens like a pancake under my feet and no longer gives me the spring in my step (and I'm less than 120lbs).They're not bad, but they're not as supportive as I'd like, especially given the price tag. I may go back to Tevas next. They're not as soft to begin with, but they provide more support so I don't feel like I'm just walking on the ground. And they're a lot cheaper.Also, the sizes run small, so get a size larger if you're not sure."
5,best flip flops ever!,"Most comfortable and sturdy flip flops I've ever owned. Like someone else on here said, I'm also a bit of a flip flops fanatic and was thrilled to find these. Shipping was fast and they arrived in good condition. Just ordered my second pair!"
3,Sandal review,These flip flops are comfortable but don't have any structure that offers any arch support. Also I have been wearing them for about a month and the rubber is already flattening. I don't think they are a good value for the cost.
5,LOVE these!,"These are the softest, most comfortable flip flops I have ever owned! I just received them today and don't want to take them off. The strap is wide enough that I feel supported and the sole wraps itself around to cradle your foot! I love these and will definitely order more in other colors. Ran true to size and width."
4,Very comfortable,"I love the comfort of these flip flops! They seem to run small, so you might consider getting the next larger size. That's what I had to do and it was easy-breezy to exchange with Amazon! Thank you!"
5,Bobos review,These shoes are one if the most comfortable flip flops I have ever worn!Your feet don't feel tired after wearing and because of all the color choices they are stylish also
5,"Love love love these sandals,",These sandals are so comfortable. This is my 4th pair I love them. I received them within a week of ordering them. Price was lower then the stores.
3,Worthwhile but a bit dissapointing -,"I bought this for my Aunt as she and my Dad were born in the Welch, WV area. I was disappointed in the recipes as I was expecting more ""old time"" recipes that my Grandmother used to talk about. The pictures were nostalgic but very very fuzzy, and of course they were copies of very old pictures. I paid a reduced price so overall, it was worth it. Also, this was in transit approx. 12 days from the time it shipped."
3,"Works good, but...",Where do you get wicks? I've been looking all over and Amazon doesn't even stock it... Makes it kind of useless after a while...
2,Pass on this one !,The first one broke in 2 months and the repair did not make it thru 2 winters ! When it worked it was too loud for a bedroom while on HI and at lower speeds did not perform well ! Along with expensive filters this is a no go !!
1,piece of crap,Bought this. Broke down in a puff of smoke in 2 days. Replaced. Now the replacement quit after 5 days. Do not waste your money on this product
2,Bad Chinese motors,"I have had bad luck with these. The first motor died about 60 days after purchase. I got a replacement humidifier. That one lasted 1 1/2 seasons of light use. Aside from that, they work well and it's a good basic design."
4,Bemis Digital Control Console Evaporative Humidifier - 4D7-800,"This humidifier is a beast! It's about the size of a TV set. However, it's on casters, so you can easily roll it out of the way.When you get the fan really rolling, it moves some serious air. I'm not convinced it's evaporating as much volume of water as claimed, though, because the tanks sometimes last for days before needing a refill. Also, the ""empty"" indicator is very low-tech. It has already failed and we need to check the tanks periodically.But the bottom line is, our house was unbearable dry and now it's better. I can't argue with the price of the unit or the amount of electricity it uses. Overall, I prefer this wick/fan system over our old humidifier, which took lots of juice and shut off every time the heating element needed scraping to remove crusted-on minerals."
2,Fan motor lasted 3 winters,"Like many others, my fan motor just died. Fortunately, it lasted longer than some of the reviewers', but I either need to replace it, send it to Essick Air for repair (doubtful?), or buy another. I'm looking at all the other whole-house portable models, and most of them have serious drawbacks, according to reviewers. (Loud, hard to fill). This model is at least easy to fill and does humidify our 1500 sq. ft. first floor to our target 45% on fan setting 3/6. But we have to turn it off when watching TV due to the noise, and it's located 20+ ft. from the home theater system. So I'm stuck...what to buy?"
1,Run from this item,"I spent my afternoon at ACE, with nothing to show. The first one had too much glue around a spring that holds the water bottle so it kept registering as empty. The second one was missing the covers to the water bottles. While waiting in line to return another group got in line to return a unit from the same manufacturer."
1,Motor burned out 10 days out of warranty.,"I bought this item direct from Amazon on January 25, 2008. The electric motor failed on Feb. 5, 2009. The unit has a one year parts warranty.Although I live in an implied warranty state, I didn't bother trying to get it fixed as I bought it with an AMEX card, so I am eligible for a refund. At least one other manufacturer - Moistair - offers a two year warranty on the motor and a one year warranty on other parts. That's what I will get with my AMEX refund check."
2,works great; but noisey as heck,"the product is pretty cheaply built; but actually works great....pumps lots of moisture into the air. downside...it is very noisy; so much in fact i run it only on speed 1 (it has 9 speeds). the noise is not only just fan noise, but the fan motor is very noisy as well. i'm very unhappy with the noise level; but haven't found anything better regarding moisture output. i also have two smaller hunter units which are almost impossible to hear; too bad hunter doesn't make a larger model...i buy it in a second."
2,Junk but might work,"This unit may turn out to work very well which will be a plus. The down side is that the quality is awful. I mean below awful. It is a thin warped plastic shell with the fan sitting on the top. Parts barely fit together. The fan is very loud and to complete the picture, it makes a loud humming sound. The company couldn't of spent more than $5-$10 building this thing. Maybe less. On the other hand, if it ends up solving our lack of humidity crisis I will give it a star or two. I wish some manufacturer would build a quality high volume humidifier. Your not suppose to keep having to buy the razor over and over again in a razor-blade scenario and products that you pay a couple of hundred dollars for shouldn't look like they came from the local dollar store."
1,"Motor Burned Out, Twice",I've owned two of these units. One lasted two winters and the other only one. In both cases the motor eventually burned out and would not start.
3,A Disappointment,"This DVD is not bad, if you're a Christian, looking for backup to show why Gnosticism was inappropriate. But if you are looking for open, unbiased information on the Judas Gospel and other Gnostic Texts, buy the National Geographic society's DVD instead. I also question the scholars used in the video. Only one of them was familiar. Why didn't the makers of the DVD contact Dr. Elaine Pagels or Dr. Bart Ehrman for interviews, or even Dr. Marvin Meyer? These are the top people in the field. I really feel that I wasted my money on this DVD and a will NOT use it for my lectures and classes on Gnosticism"
2,Freshman Film School Project??????,"Some decent ideas, but it was harder to fully grasp them because of the poor production values of this dvd. It looked like it was made on a very low budget with home video equipment and a lot of ""blue screen"" type scenes representing people in the 1st and 2nd centuries."
3,I prefer the Learning Company,"It's okay, but a lot of fluff regurgitated from your average lectures. I've gone through the Learning Company's lectures, and find them to be much more complete and more worth the time. This is a gimmick of Barnes and Noble to make themselves look more serious, but it fails miserably. If you know nothing about music, or just want to understand some pretty music, it's okay, but not really worth the price."
5,One of the best critical studies of the horror field ...,"This work presents a detailed analysis of the psychology of horror stories, what they mean in the ethos of mankind, how they emerge from primal fears and concerns, and why ghosts (imagined ghosts) will ALWAYS haunt us."
5,solid gold.,"The other review covers all the bases. The only reason I'm writing THIS is to highlight a very important fact: MATTIAS OLSSON PLAYS IN THIS BAND. He is the godly drummer of Anglagard and he also played on the second and third White Willow albums. Also, Asa Eklund, PC's sugary sweet singer, sang the song ""Thirteen Days"" from _Ex Tenebris_ by White Willow. She is also involved a bit with Anglagard's masterpiece _Epilog_. So White Willow fans and Anglagard fans should have a reason to at least give this a try. Granted, the style is different but the quality is completely comparable. AMAZING DRUMMING, flawless popcraft. A delicious cd."
1,Where's the crunch?,"Amazon recommended this disc to me based on my previous purchases from their website. So I thought, what the hell, some of their recommendations are dead on and introduced me to bands that I would have never found on my own. I read the reviews that praise this as a great pop record and bought this completely on faith. For me, good pop bands include: Jellyfish, The Police, The Beatles, XTC, The Bears, Todd Rundgren and Steely Dan. What I heard on ""Panamarenko"" was a decent female vocalist singing some very dull music played by average musicians. I listened to this repeatedly, thinking it needs to sink in, or maybe the other reviews had a different disc, but no such luck. Over time, this was so painful to listen to that I decided to crunch it in the trash."
3,Okay Movies,My son the Vampire was poor film and sound quality. Glen and Genda? was better. I would not commend these movies.
3,Old Mother Riley meets Dracula,This is really a poor quality print of My SON THE VAMPIRE (the american version of Old Mother Riley meets The Vampire) The opening reel is so chopped up you cannot make heads or tails out of the opening theme song and credits. But beggers cannot be choosers. This is the only way to get this rare film and the Video quality is about as good as its going to get for a poor print. So it is worth getting if you wish to see this film.
3,"Good CD, Just add Krayzie","This CD is definitely solid. The only grudge I have with it is the lack of Krayzie on the CD. EVERY song is featuring someone else. I like all the Thugline artists but wish this was a Krayzie Bone CD. All the tracks on this were released online before the CD came out on a Mixtape under the same name. The only difference was the cover art. This is a good COMPILATION CD, and only a decent Krayzie Bone CD."
5,Track Listing,"Got to provide, Red beans, Step back, Funkalicious, Kiko, Flash Kongara, Konkawe, smell II, Relief and Ground Round.Most songs recorded Live at Tipitina's on 12-15-92 or 5-21-93. Ground Round recorded Live at New Orleans Music Hall on 1-23-93."
1,Should be called Moth Trap Premier,"We are surrounded by 120acres of wheat, so as you might guess, our yard has been so full of mosquitos that we couldn't go outside in the middle of the afternoon. After a month of research and deciding whether or not to spend so much money, I finally bought this unit. And all it has really caught has been a bunch of small moths. I think the only mosquitos it caught were trapped in the cloud of moths going inside. Perhaps it's where I live or the type of mosquitos I have, but it didn't work for me at all. The only thing that helped was when the wheat was cut."
1,An effective moth trap,"This device is basically a glorified ""bug zapper"" in that it has a UV light with a couple blinky LEDs. And they throw in (literally) an Ocetenol lure. Basically, you pay quite a lot for a fan, small UV lamp and a couple blinky leds thrown into a cheap plastic housing. Mine failed within 1 summer because so many moths got stuck in the thing that the fan seized up with little bits-o-moth.I'm not impressed."
1,Beware-This product doesn't work.,This product does not work. They charged me $30 for shipping and after trying to ship back and pay their restocking fee I will end up with less than 25% of my original payment. Don't purchase this device.
4,Excellent for Karaoke,"This unit is small and portable, lightweight, noise is minimal. Mic input EQ is excellent!Effects for the inputs are OK..The only BIG Con is the blue led indicating the unit is ON... OMG! so bright it hurts your eyes when you are adjusting levels or the EQ.. NO Kidding!I'll just put a piece of electrical insulator tape (black) on top of it....The other issue : There is no power switch, you have to unpluggit if you will not be using it, I always store it away so this is not a big issue for me, but if you're keeping it in a fixed location, consider pluggin it to a power strip."
3,Look close before you buy this!,"I bought this unit wanting just a few more features, as I currently have the XENYX802. I used the latter in a very compact portable stage setup, and I appreciated that in almost the exact same space, I now had a few additional input channels, along with build in effects. I have an external reverb in my 802 setup, so I figured this unit would save me some space. But look closely! This unit has no EQ adjust ability on anything other than its two mic channels. There are a few other compromises, and it all comes down to this... you can't add more channels, plus effects in the same space, without running out of room for controls, so some things had to go in this design. Ultimately i returned mine, as it also had a factory defect. But had that not been the case, I don't think I'd have been satisfied for long with the missing features, so in the end I took a refund rather than a replacement."
1,Syrup and Cliches,"I was intrigued by the summary on the book jacket. Once engaged, I found the writing to be closer to a romance novel than the historical fiction feel I was looking for. The style was full of cliches and I found it unbelievable that a character could hold a candle for as long as these two did, when there was so little contact between them for such long periods of time. I prefered the style and writing of The Other Boleyn Girl by Philippa Gregory."
1,"Good premise, poor delivery","I am a devoted fan of good historical fiction, but this book is deeply flawed. I enjoyed the characters, setting, and plot development. The writing style seems more appropriate for a high school-level reader. Some authors paint complex pictures of their characters and this author limits herself to pretty descriptions of Southern scenery."
4,Great duet,"I had the video version of this single from a few years ago. This CD single is good, but could have been better. I prefer the original version, to the ""Trance"" mix, which isn't that trancey, but is ok for an alternate version.It would have been better having an extended original version and the video version. I love the begining on the video where Linda (from Milk Inc.) calls up Silvy (from Sylver) on the phone and they have an honest conversation about men who p!ss them off."
4,Yoga is the answer,Wonderful intro to yoga if you have never done it. Very doable and good music. I think yoga is the best way to shape up your arms and hips and there is such a low risk for injury. Kathy is always the best trainer too.
1,Not what I was expecting,"I love Kathy Smith, but this video is really out of date, the picture on the front is of her more recently, but the video itself is from the 90's, so the music is really cheesy, and the yoga is very beginner level... I was disappointed."
4,No sophmore slump here,"I couldn't wait to read Easter Rising and I wasn't disappointed. Michael once again let us see behind the curtain of his family and Southie and didn't sugar-coat the more unpleasant details. I was surprised that in the acknowledgements at the end of the book, Michael thanked his whole family (alive and dead) except for Joe-was curious if that was a accidential or intentional omission."
5,GREAT BOOK!,"This book is in my top 5 reads for 2006. I connected to it on a ton of levels - the way Michael Patrick MacDonald descibes falling in love with Punk Rock, his outsider tendecies, and his experiences in Ireland finding his roots. For anyone from Boston, anyone into Punk Rock, anyone who was ""the weird kid"" growing up, and any Irish American's out there, THIS IS THE PAGE TURNER FOR YOU!!!!!!!"
1,Not accepting the programming,"The programming steps are easy to follow, however this remote does NOT work with 2006 Suzuki as advertised. Just to convince myself, I even tried using it on older and newer models but it just does NOT program. Do not waste your money on this device. Spend the extra and have the professionals program any remote you wish to use."
1,Caveat Emptor,The author of this book is a SELF-PROCLAIMED expert. Much of what he says is utter nonsense and on further research I discovered that the schools being promoted are the schools he himself owns. Caveat EmptorBEWARE!
3,It worked after a little massaging,This was for a 2000 Pontiac Grand Am. This was the closest kit I could find that would fit the car and the fit was not as close as I would have liked. I've used other scosche kits in the past and been very pleased.
3,Beautiful and Complicated,This is a beautiful watch. It looks incredible. However we are still trying to figure out how to program it.
4,The first grown-up scent I ever wore,"I've been wearing Bulgari Extreme for almost 12 years now. It has easily been on of my favorite fragrances. I'd like to describe Extreme as that hidden choice when most guys tend to opt for the more commercially-advertised, mainstream fragrances. It is subtle, yet sexy. It's manly and of earthy-notes but still smooth and attractive. It conveys confidence and sophistication, yet modern sensibility. I find it suitable for morning and afternoon wear."
5,Great CD,"I was looking for some danceable music, listened to this in the store and bought it. Its one of my favourite CDs."
3,"Good. Not great, but good.",This sword came within a reasonable amount of time and was really heavy. The weight of the sword was amazing I had no idea how heavy and solid this sword really was. The main problem I had with the sword is when it got here all the brass pieces except for the hilt were loose and came right off. I had to use a hot glue gun to fix them and re-attach all the brass pieces to the sheath. Another thing that impressed me was the quality and strength of the rope that holds the sword on your shoulder or belt. Great sword and a great buy for the price. Words of warning to those who lack some upper-body strength this sword is going to be difficult to get used to but if you would like a sword like this look for the sword of the other captain. Captain Gene.
5,Buy this is you don't buy anything else this year!,"What can I say? This is my first time out with Ms Gray and I was stunned. A sexy believable hero, a truly horrible situation, and tons and tons of suspense. You really felt you were out there on the road with Josh, the truck driving hero. And the alchemy stuff was creepy enough to make me want to look both ways before going to take a leak a night. You have to read this. It's fab."
2,What the .....?,Did not care for this book. I don't know if I would classify it as more weird or just stupid. The concept of alchemists and the curse associated with passing of dried human skin was pretty crazy. I like a good horror book but this was just not my cup of tea.
4,"Not a bad book, if you're not expecting much","I read this because of a review I saw in Fangoria. It wasn't a great review but it got me interested enough to read it. It involves a trucker who encounters evil in the town of furnace. At times this book is a real page turner but at others it makes you think you could have picked a better book. I expected more than I got and that is probably why I was disappointed, but if you aren't expecting a whole lot and can stick with it till the end you might find it to be somewhat enjoyable."
1,"Even worse than ""Trickster""","Ugh. Even though I hated ""Trickster"", I always like to give authors another chance to win me over. So just to be fair I tried ""Furnace."" Unfortunately, I found the same things in this book as Gray's previous novel: needless brutality, characters I didn't like, and a slow, slow, slow plot. I'm sorry to say I gave up on it after about 75 pages. Pick up almost any other horror novel and you're guaranteed to get a better read than this."
2,Great beginning but goes bad quickly halfway thru.,"I loved this book at the start. The story was so engaging and ominous. The baby being run over at the start and the evil, evil, evil looking bird following Josh everywhere had me hooked. The characterization was ace too and I felt for Josh a great deal in many of his dire circumstances.But then the plot just got bogged down in hokey black magic mumbo jumbo. It lost control and just went crazy. Perhaps I didn't read it right or had other expectation but I think that it all could have been told in a better and less stupidly from that point on. Too bad considering such a strong opening."
4,Superior Supernatural Thriller,"I've never done serious over-the-road trucking, but I've driven hundreds of thousands of miles around the U.S., fairly often pulling the kind of marathons that Josh Spiller and his trucker buddies do. The American road is a world of its own, and I've read few books that capture it. Muriel Gray really nails it, which is surprising given that she's from Scotland. She mentions in the acknowledgements that she took a cross-country trip with a trucker as part of her research. She was obviously paying attention.As for the rest, the characters are believable, the plot moves right along, and it's nice to read a good novel about America where the characters are working class. This is popular fiction, not serious literature, but it's a darn good read."
5,"Scary, gripping and totally fab","If you haven't checked out Muriel Gray, this is the time to do it. The Trickster was great , but this is even better. Josh Spiller is a truck driver who sees a baby being killed and then finds that he is at the centre of a terrifying plot from which there is no escape. Or is there? You won't want to put this down and be prepared to be very afrid as you continue reading into the small hours. Hey Muriel! Where's the next one ?"
5,furnace,i thought the book was exciting and i couldnt put it down until i read the whole thing. i cant wait for the next book
3,The plot outline for this book is from an older story.,"No mention is made in any of these reviews of the original story, M. R. James' ""Casting the Runes"", this was taken from. Several variations of this theme have recently come into print, from Bernard Taylor's EVIL INTENT, to James Hynes third story in PUBLISH AND PERISH (also called ""Casting the Runes""). So far, all three have merely drawn out and enlongated a far better story. Read the original. M. R. James was far abler at giving a true frisson of fear without the brutality."
1,Disappointing,"Thankfully, I got this book from the library & didn't pay a penny for it (just wasted hours of my life; oh well). Cardboard characters, derivative style of writing, so ""American"" it hurts (the author is Scottish) - a complete waste of time. I was drawn to this book because of the alleged connection with a ghost story of my all time fave author, M.R. James, titled ""Casting the Runes"" (on which the movie ""Curse [or Night] of the Demon"" was based), but this novel just managed to convince me again that MRJ is the master of his field, and that emulation is not as easy as it looks (whether emulation in itself could ever be a good idea is another question). Skip this one (or get it from the library if you have to) and get MRJ's Collected Ghost Stories instead - at least those are as scary as they are stylish. ""The Furnace"" is neither."
2,Silly Teenage Fare,"This is a fantasy book for teens. Yep! There really are evil monsters that follow the biddings of satanic witches. Our trucker hero, Josh, is caught up in a small, isolated Virginia town's nightmare when he accidentally runs over a newborn in a stroller.When he refuses to recant his story that an evil woman pushed the stroller purposefully into the truck's path, the bad guys have got to silence him.This was written in an average writing style with silly, unbelievable characters. Gray, I'm sure, will have lots of followers--those who like books about witches, dragons, zombies, and anything else teenager-ish. Please don't waste your time with this!"
2,Definitely not my favorite,"Other reviewers related the story so I'll stick to my critique...The story itself isn't too bad. I didn't expect the twist toward the end; the book was interesting enough to keep me occupied in the airport.I didn't care for her gory description in the beginning, about the baby who got run over by the main character's truck. Anyone who is the least bit squeamish will most likely feel ill if they also have a good imagination like I do. I also thought it could be scarier, it just didn't feel believable to me. (for instance, I like Stephen King because some of his material is closer to reality and the way people actually act.) Other reviewers also had good points about some of the language being a bit different.Basically, it's okay if you have nothing better to read."
4,"Good sound, Great value.","I've only had mine for a month, but I am very pleased so far. My previous Onkyo 304 burned up in a few months and didn't sound as good. The panasonic is clearer and has good power. Because it is much smaller than the onkyo and seems to run cooler overall, I'm hopeful it will last much much longer than the onkyo (I have the receiver in kind of a tight space). Overall, I don't suggest onkyo at all. My Onkyo DVD changer went out in a month and got repaired under warranty. When the aforementioned receiver died, it was time for me to move on. I'm glad I did. I think most would be quite happy with the Panasonic sa-xr55."
4,"Great sound, great value","This is an excellent value. I couldn't be more pleased with the quality of the sound. The only down side is the aesthetics on the face; it looks a little cheap and the volume knob doesn't inspire confidence though it is quite functional. But I bought it to listen to it, not look at it, and it sounds great!"
1,Defective Unit And Bad Support,"I bought this unit based on all of the good reviews. I am replacing a Harmon Kardon 700 that suddenly lost three speaker channels, which I understand now is common. Anyway, I was very much looking forward to receiving and installing the Pana. It took quite a while to unhook and remove the HK and hook up the Pana. After all that work, all I get is a brief ""f76"" flashing on the screen and then it turns off! The manual is no help; it only says to ""consult your dealer."" Likewise Pana's website support doesn't even appear to mention this problem. Their phone support line just kept ringing busy every time I called. I will call again tomorrow and try to keep an open mind, but I am very disappointed in receiving a product that won't even turn on!"
5,It's a quality product,"Pros-Low energy consumption and yet plenty of volumeMany connections. Two digital coax and two optical.Whenever the input is digital, the display shows which speakers are receiving information from the source so you know if you are truly getting dolby digital 5.1 or dts etc.Does well with analog sources but fantastic with digital inputs.Cons-S-video inputs are a bit flimsy but once you get the signals going through it doesn't require further adjustment. Not much else."
1,DESIGNED FROM THE GROUND UP TO BE JUNK,"Worst PC I've ever bought.This hunk-o-junk was a POS from the 2nd day I had it.Countless crashes, VISTA CAN NOT RUN ON LESS THAN 3GB OF RAM!!! This unit has only 2gb, and to make this thing a genuine boat anchor? The fact that it's architecture is incompatible with any other OS. THAT'S RIGHT! It's incompatible with all software OS's, and it can not run THE VERY OS SYSTEM IT WAS DESIGNED FOR!!!!!!!!!!!!Sony's All-in-ones are worthless garbage. Buy ANYONE'S All-in-ones before you buy a Sony."
5,The Envy of My Peers,"This beauty is my pride and joy. It has an large, bright screen thats great for surfing, gaming, or watching DVDs and TV. Thats right - I watch TV on this baby. I also can store all of my music and digital photos. The best part about it - I can throw it in my backpack and take it with me because it sets up really fast.I have nothing bad to say about the machine itself. Everyday it amazes me with something new! Strangers come by just to get a gander at this stunning peice. Most gapers are quick to criticize, but that's usually a sure sign of jealousy."
5,Wonderful!,"I've seen this guy in concert many times when I visited Dublin in the early '90s. He was just fabulous to listen to and a really nice guy, too! I was close to a good friend of his and we used to go to all of his concerts and he was really amazing. I hope I can see him in concert again, someday. I guess until then I'll listen to him on CD. It really is a great collection of this guys music. Teri from Nebraska, USA 27"
5,"Fit, stylist all terrific...","Lots of compliments......lots of where did you get that item....comfortable, washable, heavy duty zipper. Doesn ot fade, tons of pockets (perfect for carrying your cell phone too)."
2,Not a good live representation,"Having been a Robert Cray fan for over 20 years I found this album lacking in any kind of sparkle or interest. The guitar work seems flat, the band sound bored. Sounds like Robert on an off night. Maybe it's because it was recorded while doing a support gig."
5,Amazing,"I saw him first on Eric Clapton's Guitar Festival and was blown away. This CD is another amazing performance live and the man is brilliant. Not a real blues fan until now but his guitar work can change your mind. His band is top notch too, never thought I could groove to an organ before.Love this album bought two, one for a friend, you must share this man.Highly recommend it."
4,Live If You Want It!,"I had been eagerly awaiting a Robert Cray live disc when this beauty popped out at me at a Border's store. To be honest, at first I was disappointed. The first track 'Phone Booth' had the kinda funk groove that put the original studio version to shame. But after that, I struggled with the rest of the recording.Thank heavens I stuck with the two disc set. This is the Cray lineup at its best live.Throw away 'I Was Warned' as too noisy and 'Back Door Slam' as uninspired. But, the rest of the album shows a working band on the road giving its all opening for Clapton at the cavernous Royal Albert Hall."
4,Up there with studio albums,This is a very good double live album well worth the purchase. If you have all the other cds this one will be played just as much. It is a little different in sound to the originals beceause its live making it sort of different. Most live albums are played a couple of times and thats it but this one is different and you will keep playing it. Not a waste of money at all.
3,Soffritto=taking time to make good food,"You would have to be a pure Tuscan to really appreciate this book to the fullest. Some of the parts of the recipes could be confusing....or there are instances where you have to use ingredients that she does not define what they are or where to find them. I would not purchase this book unless you are really serious about spending time, money, and confusion for this product...."
1,Extremely Disappointed,"I was so looking forward to this DVD and now, after watching it, I can honestly say it was a total waste of money! I could have done something quite similar using the Internet and PowerPoint. I have been a fan of Michael's since the first time I saw him on the Ed Sullivan Show, when he and I were both quite small and this DVD was not flattering, not a tribute, not entertaining. It was just bizarre and I do not recommend it to anyone!"
1,Do not recommend,"I recieved this today and was very disappointed. If you are Michael Jackson fan you probably have most of the footage in other DVD's. The narration did not match the footage, some of it was incorrect. When it was over all I could say was WHAT???"
3,Michael Jackson - The Secret of a Legend,"I liked this video because it showed pictures and videos about Michael Jackson. I love seeing his face and watching him. He was such an amazing and unique person. Other than that, the video itself was ok. This was not one of the better videos of Michael and it certainly did not do his work, humanitarian efforts, or his legacy justice. If you have the extra money, then get this video. If you don't, save your money. It's not a ""have to have it"" kind of video of Michael Jackson. RIP Michael."
1,Not worth your money,"The title of this DVD,""The Secrets of a Lengend"", is a definite misnomer, for there are no secrets revealed about Michael Jackson on this DVD, there's nothing new that's revealed at all. It's just a rehashing of video that have probably been seen on other Michael Jackson videos or have been seen on tv, and the makers of this DVD are so obviously trying(and succeeding) in profiting off of his death with this inferior product. They should feel ashamed, and this is a ripoff!DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!"
5,Michael Jackson: The Secret of a Legend,"I got it and I agree it is a great collection item to havePat Minton(Louisville, Ky)"
1,Disappointed,This lemon pepper was advertise as NO SALT. So I ordered NO SALT LEMON PEPPER and received lemon pepper with salt. I was very disappointed but didn't bother to return it.
3,Packaging problem,The lemon pepper is pretty good but they didn't make the holes big enough to shake it out easily. Its kind of annoying but not a deal breaker!
5,Excellent Historical Perspective,"Got this for my mom. She spent 5 years in radio's heyday back in the 30's, before becoming a WAVE in WWII. She actually called me today to express her gratitude for all the memories and people this book brought back to her. She loved the facts behind the facts / people as well."
4,breaking the curfew,"This book was an unexpected surprise for me; it is a little known gem. Brilliantly and beautifully written, an absolute pleasure to read.The cover was unpromising, but once opened, it is hard to put down. Duncans detailed analysis, and strong imagery provides for a highly readable text, where the happenings of a complex country and its people are presented in a style that is informative and engaging. This is one of my favorite books on Pakistan, and I would highly recommend it to everyone who is interested in knowing more about this region."
1,not worth much,"You can pick up this book cheap, but it's not worth much.I thought it was funny that two previous users who haven't reviewed any other books both happened to use the same UK slang word ""freshers"". One of them is supposedly from Chicago. Yeah, right. Maybe they are friends of the author.I didn't even know what they were talking about at first. A dictionary gives this definition:noun [C] UK INFORMALa student who has recently started studying at a college or universityAnyway, don't know why this book would be good for students. I doubt there are many colleges which offer classes in Palm programming. Maybe it is good for students who want to pretend that they worked on real world projects and gives them something to talk about. Otherwise, I don't think the book is useful."
1,Palm OS Programming Professional Projects,"I've learned Palm OS, C++ and Codewarrior from ground up. This book did'nt provide much additional information on anything. It's good from standpoint of how to go through design process but provides little information on Palm OS. I've found the Palm OS Programming Bible is about the best reference on how to write code. If your just starting to learn buy Instant OS Applications."
1,Don't waste your money - forgetable.,"As one other reviewer stated, get Palm OS Bible and the O'Reilly book Palm OS Developer's Guide 2nd Edition."
2,Electronics nightmare!,"The guitar itself is beautiful looking, unbelievably light weight and fast playing. The wiring is another matter! I have owned two different C-1 guitars and both of them have been VERY POORLY wired. The pickup selector switch must be the cheapest thing Schecter could find. The bridge pickup cuts in and out on a regular basis. When the coil tap is used the volume drops significantly. Several other people I know have had the same problems with their Schecters. Plan on doing lots of soldering if you buy this guitar!"
2,"Love, Loss Hope Retreat","I was informed that if I enjoyed Great Big Sea, I should enjoy Carbon Leaf. I found there was no comparison at all. Great Big Sea songs create such enthusiasm to its listeners, but I found that not to be true to the songs from Carbon Leaf. If you like Great Big Sea, don't buy this CD from Carbon Leaf."
3,Snoring Sleeepy Music,"I have really enjoyed Carbon Leaf's music for a while now. However, this is uncreative sleepy music for the most part. I miss the energy of previous albums. They seem to have lost their roots and core sound with this album. Lets hope they find their Celtic, Blue Grass and Rock selves again in the next effort. Check out previous releases such as ""5 Alive"", ""Echo Echo"" or even earlier material."
2,yoyoyoyoyoyo,"Pretty cool riffs and music, but nothing that felt incredibly cool to me. It says on the inside that no triggers, vocal effects, or lyrics were used in this album. No triggers or vocal effects is awesome, the production is great. But no lyrics weirds me out... I mean sure with other bands like this you can't understand the lyrics, but at least you know they're there.... haha. But actually I think with some other bands... the fact that they're trying to say words makes the gutturals sound much cooler.... because it makes it like a monster is talking. But with this it's pretty obvious they're just making sounds."
3,"For us ""old"" folks","The lights in restaurents are getting dimmer, and I am getting older. Bad Mix! The magnifier and light is just what I needed. Every time I bring it out, they all want to know where I got it. I need to get some more as gifts."
3,Works OK,It is thicker than expected. I end up using the higher magnification circle most of the time. Be careful not to leave the light on. Not bad for the price but I am not overly excited either.
4,Nice unit,"I purchased the Maverick R-395 to replace aOregon Scientific BARM699 Touch-Controlled AM/FM Radio Alarm Clock with Weather, which I found very underwhelming. The Maverick has a constant back light, better radio reception and is much easier to operate. On the negative side, the readout is a little fuzzy, the back light shines through case by the speaker and I think the back light color being based on the outdoor temperature is a little silly. I live in Minnesota, it's going to be blue 8 months out of the year."
3,clock,Did not find this item very easy to use. The time was very hard to set and finally had to do it manually. Would not buy this product again.
2,Advertised Size Fit is Wrong!,"Ad and Packaging say that the XL-size fits a 31"" tire....Wrong! Order the next size larger if you expect it to properly fit your Jeep spare."
5,Perfect Fit: 2012 Wrangler Sahara,"The tire cover is a perfect fit for the stock spare on my Jeep Wrangler. The tire is a bit over 31"" in diameter and it was a snug fit that took a little work to get on, but now that it is it fits perfectly. Do not order this if your tire is wider than 31""."
5,Exceeded Expectations,"I purchased this tire cover in 2008. I replaced the tires on my Jeep Liberty with a slightly larger set and couldn't find any tire cover locally that fit. This was the only tasteful cover I could confirm was the correct size, so I ordered it. It's now 2011 and I couldn't be more pleased. This cover has really held up. My vehicle is stored outside so it's held up to the elements well. I have a long commute and I do a 5 tire rotation every 6000 miles or so, consequently, I've taken this tire cover on and off quite a bit and it's easy to do and isn't showing any signs of failing. It looks pretty sharp too."
4,fits and looks great,"fits and looks good, thought I ordered the denim so a bit let down but easy fit and seems very durable, keeping it and confident it will hold up and do a good job"
2,Watch out - this one is an acre of pleatherique,"The size is right for 315/75R16. Bestop makes good covers, but...Watch out - this particular one is crushed leatherique shiny vinyl. It looks like a bad '70s bean bag.If you're into that, or don't care what it looks like, then the price might make it for you since it's less than the Black Denim one.I sent this one back to get the Black Denim one I had thought I was buying - THAT one looks great on my Landcruiser.YMMV"
5,Great basic tire cover,"This is a basic tire cover, but it's better than most. Bestop makes good products. It fit the stock spare tire on my '09 Wrangler just fine. It's not *quite* the same shade of black as the soft top, but it's pretty close, close enough for me anyway. I'm happy with it!"
5,Good system but the price's a joke !,The sytem works perfectly but this price is a joke. Every online fishstore sells the same system for $159-$179 instead of $204.97 !
5,Fun and Educational!,This DVD is great! The DVDs really make learning vocabulary fun using pop culture clips and clever mnemonics. You can't help but learn. The lessons are split into 5 chapters that last about ten minutes long. I wanted more after they were all done. Highly recommend!
2,Not enough help for an old man ...,"I got this magnifying lens ... easy to install.I suppose it makes the numbers somewhat larger ... but my 80 year old father was not helped by it :-(Maybe if your eyes are only a little bad, this can help."
5,perfume present,I am a father buying a present for my daughter in the US. She likes the fragrance and i like buying it for her. Regards Don.
3,...a nice record...,"It's a good record but some music's are too long. There are 4 music's very good but the rest is dispensable, in my opinion.Paulo Domingos, Portugal"
1,The TRUTH About 1979 Hoffa Photo!,"Everyone knows Jimmy Hoffa disappeared, but nobody knows why he did or where he went.However, it can be proved Hoffa was spotted in a local newspaper photograph taken in 1979 of a group of prominent Syracuse NY business leaders and political figures, all of whom made sworn statements to the FBI, grand juries and Congressional committees investigating the Hoffa matter that Jimmy Hoffa was, indeed, not only present but very much alive.The FBI admitted this was true. They confirmed Hoffa disappeared during July, 1975 and the photograph was positively proven to have been taken in October, 1979, some four years and three months after his alleged kidnapping. Their explanation was that in Syracuse everything occurs five years after it happens everywhere else and Hoffa's 1979 photo in Syracuse wasn't proof he was actually alive anywhere else on the planet.Thus, the mystery of Hoffa's disappearance remains unsolved."
5,AWSOME!!,"If you love the music of San Andreas you will love this box set, i dont see why you cant just listen to it on the game, it is good for the serious collector."
1,Crap unless you want something other than rap,"I preordered this soundtrack under the impression that like the Grand Theft Auto: Vice City boxset it would include every song used in the game, but WRONG. The whole reason I bought this was to get a copy of several old Snoop, Dr Dre, Ice Cube, and NWA tracks used in the gamethat I only had on tape. And all of those tracks are missing. Everything else is here so bottom line: If you want tracks from Playback FM or Radio Los Santos you will be disappointed."
1,Biggest POS,"The best tracks in the game don't even make it to the damn soundtrack!? No Snoop Dogg, Dre or Ice?! A big waste of money, it only got one star cause the box looked nice."
3,"good collection, but WHY BUY IT?","I can see why you might buy this if you don't own the game and just like the songs on the mix, but if you own the PC version of the game you can just listen to the tracks in the car or extract them to Ogg Vorbis and expand them onto CD if you want to.So I can't really see why if you own the PC game you'd still buy this.Having said that, I like the selection, and like the Vice City box set (which you can extract to MP3 from the PC game) it has slightly different DJ chatter, which is always funny.Just try to behave yourself when you put it in your car stereo. Remember, you're NOT playing the game then. It's real life."
4,Grand theft Auto,Brought this game for a friend. He loves it. States the graphics are great. Price was great compared to store prices. Game arrived undamaged.
3,WTF!?!,"ok ok ok you do NOT make a GTA CD box with country music in it i mean come on. Mabye when your playing the game but i dont think its right to have one hole frickin' CD dedicated to country music in a GTA box. Also Radio Los Santos has to share a CD with Playback. Obviously the only reason your gana buy this is because of the great rap and mabye for the old school dance music you might share with your parents... NOT LOL!!!Finally they also cut out some of the best songs from the gamewhich include ""187"" Snoop Dog and Dr. Dre, ""The Ghetto"" (my favorite song) Too Short and many more. Even though they did have did have Slick Rick, Kid Frost and 2pac. There just wasnt enough rap in this box. If they took out the country and had Radio Los Santos have its own CD this would be perfct!"
3,Where's the rest of the music?,"Rockstar did an amazing job of compiling a lot of great music for this game, but they haven't released it all. I'm not sure why, but lots of songs are left out of the soundtrack. For instance, Radio Los Santos is only represented by six songs on the soundtrack, even though there are 16 in the game; not to mention that Radio Los Santos was combined with Playback, which is only represented with 5 songs on the soundtrack. Why didn't they each have their own disc, like the rest of the radio stations? The quality is great. The commercials are hillarious. Why didn't they include all the music? The soundtrack box set could have and would have been a lot better if they hadn't omitted a lot of great music. I would rather have purchased CDs of individual radio stations, if they were to include all of the songs from the game."
2,Where's All The Good Music?,"I pre ordered this thing thinking that I would be blown away. When I saw the updated track lists and found out all of SF-UR was missing I just about died. Plus music like the track you do the Low rider too and the Stone Roses, Playing with the Queen of Hearts.....? All missing. Granted that Vice City was missing some music but not enough to warrant a complaint. The hard core HIp Hop was also missing. I think this soundtrack wasn't very strong to begin with. Plus the versions of some of the songs aren't the same as in the game. Roy Ayers Running Away is a louder version on the game off of a different album. Overall it's cool to have for bragging rights but not quite what I was hoping for I was hoping for Hans Oberland and his House Music."
3,Some great songs left out of the soundtrack,"This 8 cd box set has some great songs, most take place in the late 80's and early 90's, however, some great songs that were included in the game, such as Welcome to the Jungle and Lowrider, were left out of the official soundtrack. Those two songs were one reason why i bought this soundtrack so I was a bit dissapointed to find out they weren't even included. Overall it isn't a bad set but some of the cd's in the box set are a bit crappy and you'll find yourself forgetting about half of the cd's a few weeks down the line.I suggest you only buy this box set if you're a die-hard fan of the Grand Theft Auto games because as good as some of the songs are and as many cd's as this box set includes, you'll be dissapointed too."
3,"Period curiosity, but buy a single volume","A reasoanble engaging bunch of stories from the turn of the century. Raffles was a cat burglar, who had some clever adventures. A little bit goes a long way and Oxford press has released shorter collections.If you like this sort of ""rival of SherlocK Holmes"" story Raffles is pleasant, otherwise pass."
4,A fun little collection of trivia,"This book is teeny, so you can't expect it to be full of footnotes and in-depth detail. But it does a nice job in each little area, starting with some ancient invention or concept and showing in a few short pages how that idea has developed.For instance, taking a segment at random, one on entertainment begins with ancient music, then moves to instruments, then to the phonograph, then radio, then projection of images and to movies.It has lots of little random facts, and though someone knowledgeable in a given area could quibble over the choices, the point is, you will probably learn a little something in each area that you might not have known. You might make a connection you hadn't made. Or, you might be bored an need to move to another section.Think of this book as a jumping off point. If you are an aspiring inventor, you could do worse than review 5 or 6 sections in here before you sit down to your work each day. It's far from perfect, but it's worth a look."
2,Not enough information,"This book had very little information. This could have been because it was so small. It had Different categories of inventions (i.e.: travel, communication, entertainment), and each category got two to four pages. There would be about 5 or less inventions in each category, each being described with a few sentences. At the beginning of every section, there would be an introduction, full of obvious statements (Travel: As people began to travel, inventions to make travel faster and easier were made.) If you were going to write a report on an invention, 3 sentences wouldn't be enough information. If you have deep pockets, the book is indeed pocket sized, but I don't know why you'd waste a pocket on this book."
1,Poor editing,"The editing is absolutely atrocious. I bought this book in 2004 to help me study for a different exam. I thought the two were bound to cover similiar ground. Therefore, I can't give you much response on the topics as ultimately they were very different. Even though, some of the correct answers provided to questions on segments of reading were iffy. Another problem was that sonme of the questions were repeated. Also overall the quality of the text feels like someone just ran out copies at staples.It might be of some help, but I'ld be certain to study with another book as well."
1,K&N air filter 33-2740,This item does not fit Pajero V6 3.8L NP [Engine 6G75] it is less than half the size required.The web site suggests this is the model is to suit 2005 Pajero 3.8l which should be O.K.There does not seem to be a model filter made to fit.Make sure you check dimensions carefully before purchasing any filters as there are errors on some products.
3,good book for those want to improve their posture,this producto is ok have some very simple techniques and suggestion for posture improvement.
5,Excellent Alexander Technique book with great pictures,This is one of the best Alexander Technique books I have seen in the 30 years I have been interested in the technique. The author is an Irish Alexander teacher and trainer of other Alexander teachers.I have put into immediate use some of the exercises in the book and it has helped me dramatically.I very highly recommend this book!
4,Class book purchase,"Good book as an introduction to the Alexander Technique but was a bit of a bore to read. This is the only book my professor chose not to use again next semester so maybe he picked up on this too. Overall, a decent book. It did have many pictures which are nice when learning the Alexander Technique."
5,Beautifully Illustrated Introduction to the Alexander Technique,This is a fantastic book for anyone who has never heard about the Alexander Technique before. It takes the reader step by step to understand what the technique is and how it came about. I personally really enjoyed the wonderful photos showing you how to move with grace and poise. I can thoroughly recommend this book for yourself or as a gift.
3,Too much pages,The product goes deep in the MPLS TE teory and some practice in IOS also. But there is so many pages with no relevant info.
5,Happy Lil' Whistler,"Looks good. Whistles good. Good price. But I am perplexed by the routine maintenance guidelines. You are not supposed to leave water standing in the kettle as it may cause rust. Rust?. . . when I chose ""stainless"", that wasn't the picture I had in my head. Besides, everybody leaves water in the kettle. Moreover, to aid in preventing rust, you are supposed to wipe the inside of the kettle dry after emptying it. i would be happy to comply, but wiping out a kettle that has just been emptied of boiling water might hurt.Basically a nice little teakettle: as long as you ignore everything they say, you should be quite happy with it."
1,junk,"Do not waste your money. Unless you have some grand plan to make this work given some raw material, forget it."
3,I guess it's the best looking way...,"to watch a anime from the days of 4:9. '~The Second Raid' really is the only one of the three that profited from a Blu-Ray release. Good show but sadly, it doesn't end the overall plot which didn't end with the last release either."
2,problems with disc.,"I was happy to receive my copy of Full Metal Panic! season one. But i wasn't happy after i played disc 1. Episodes 3-6 won't play correctly. They either start in the middle of the episode or freeze during the opening song. Episode 6 is actually bits and pieces of episode 18. I'm not sure how to explain it. The discs say they were made in Mexico, I guess they don't make good discs in Mexico. All the other discs were ok, just disc 1 was bad."
3,Any Renee is worth having,"Okay, while this is nowhere near the best work from Renee Geyer, it's not nearly as bad as Renee herself seeims to consider it. It's just a shame that the production and arrangements are generallyso unsympathetic to that magnificent voice. At times it sounds like she's singing in the next room. Only on the title track does the power and texture of her voice get the chanceto shine. All My Love, Without Love and Guess Who I Saw Today? are also well worth the price of admission. The clinical arrangements of some of the material really lets it down though. If you're looking for the best of Renee, start elsewhere, but diehard fans should certainly have this."
3,dog spray,"I TRIED SOME OF THIS STUFF AT MY VETS OFFICE AND IT SMELLED GREAT BUT UNFORTUNATELY THIS S NOT THE SAME STUFF AND IT'S VERY GREASY SO IF USING ON YOUR DOGS HEAD, USE SPARINGLY, OTHERWISE THE DOGS HAIR WILL LOOK VERY DIRTY AND YUKKY.I HAD TO RE-WASH MY DOG AFTER USING IT. ALSO DIDN'T SMELL THAT GREAT EITHER. WASTE OF MONEY."
3,Fun to use,"The product requires patience; however, once you get the hang of it, it works!!!! Not for long-term use; however, in the short term, it makes a remarkable difference."
1,Use scotch tape instead,I've used all kinds of tapes for face and neck. This is the worst. It doesn't stick at all. You are better off using scotch tape.
4,Left me wanting songs...,"This album is a collection of instrumental tracks. Most of the tracks are beginnings, fragments, sketches -- rather than complete compositions, even though they are are well produced. They sound as if you were listening to a Sebadoh sound check or dress rehearsal, sans voice. The tracks Rudy Trouvé contributed seized my imagination more than Barlow's work on this album, being more dreamy, minimal and at the same time more engaging. I love instrumental music that winds on and on and on, building layers of sound to a climax -- the tracks on this album, particularly those from Barlow, feel unfinished in this respect, and tend to finish just at the point where you think maybe he'll start singing. Nevertheless, as a somewhat eccentric collection of ideas, the album works really well."
4,"Good, but not complete.","This book is considered the standard reference for grading coins. It's very well done with B&W images and descriptions, but only covers coin grades up to AU50. If you collect MS grade coins, this book really won't be of much help to you."
2,Photograde,"While the book is unique and helpful with the pictures depicting the grade of most coins, it is outdated! I was very disappointed to not find grading guides for the new state quarters (1999,ff). I read on the title page that it was last revised in 1995! Yet, the book was copyrighted in 2005. I thought I was buying a current book to aid me in grading my coins. Wrong!"
5,Jerzygal,This is a fabulous book which enables the reader to compare their coins to what the various grades of coins should look like. Highly recommended!
1,Disappointed **NOT AN UPDATE** Don't waste your money,There is nothing new in this book except the 19th on the edge of the cover. It doesn't even cover the state quarters or presidential dollars. I am very disappointed in the quality of the photographs. I would have expected quality Color photos in this day but these photos are of 1970 B&W quality and not the quality of todays digital photos. It's just a poor and lazy update of prior versions to give the author a boost in money. If the author wants a good book then completely redo it with high quality color photos and add the new coins for more accurate grading. Do not waste your money on this book. Buy an older used one for less money.
3,"Poor pictures, inconsistent descriptions, blank pages.","Beware of blank pages. The copy I got has blank pages 167, 171, 177, 185. This is very sloppy quality control at the printer's shop.Image quality is what should set this book apart. Sadly, the illustrations are not high-quality photos. This was not the place to scrimp. These illustrations are not quite as good as those in the ""Official ANA Grading Standards"" book. One sees far better pictures in eBay.Descriptions of grading points for coins are not consistent through a grade, in that the same points are not discussed in every grade of a coin. What points are discussed are not first fully described in the MS70 grade, so the reader clearly knows what the element should look like, and how it is degraded down through all levels.Since neither the descriptions nor the photographs are of high quality, the book is not of high quality. Good idea, poor execution. What you see on the cover is not what you get inside."
2,No Mint States,"This book gives photograde illustrations only to grade AU50, and the pictures are not very clear for comparison."
4,Good info...Bad binding,"The book has all the information you need about coins, but the book quality is poor. A page came out of the book after only a little use. I had to tape the page back into the book. Poor quality! Not happy!"
4,Great for coin collectors,The book is very thorough and gives a good detailed account of the various coin grades for specific US coins. The pictures could be of greater quality and have more detail. Still a very useful book
1,This was worthless,"The description was that of a photographic grading guide. Photographic to me means just that...actual photographs of the different grades. Every items was in black and white. Also, the grading stopped at AU. What happened to the uncirculated grades?Anyone other than a novice will be extremely disappointed with this product."
1,WASTE of MONEY: Do NOT buy this lousy book,"This book hasn't been updated in ages and gives maybe 4 to 6 POOR black and white photos that take you up to AU. What about MS60-70??? This book is now an embarrassment and USED to be the heat.Do not waste your money get ""The Official American Numismatic Association Grading Standards of United States Coins"", which isn't even up to my standards but is a whole lot better than this worthless book.The Official American Numismatic Association Grading Standards of United States Coins (Official American Numismatic Association Grading Standards for United States Coins)"
5,Smithsonian Restaurant,"Fantastic Recipes. We had eaten at the Native American Smithsonian Restaurant everyday while in DC. The best food! We were on the waiting list for this cookbook for a year. Simple, good food."
5,Foods of the Americas,This is a very interesting cook book that uses some very interesting things that are not very hard to get at your local supermarket !!!
5,Super Stuff,"My eclectus was very leary first about being sprayed but now tolerates this very well. Her feather condition is greatly improved. She is not a plucker, her feathers just looked rough. I will continue to use this product. Very happy with it. No smell, not greasy. Excellent!"
1,Perpetuating racism,"This book gets one star because that is the lowest review available. The author absolutely engages in the constant blaming and bashing of ""white"" people through the use of such bile as blaming ""white"" people for the invention of racism and limiting racist practices to only ""whites"". This book fails to acknowledge that ""white"" people encompass a large variety of cultures, furthermore the author fails to recognize that there is a difference between ""white"" and American.In short this book is offensive, offers only misinformation and is as useful as the author is knowledgeable about unifying Americans and ending racism...SAVE YOUR MONEY."
5,Miracle healer!,"I had a severe allergic reaction to laundry detergent. Itchy, dry, raised, rashes ALL over my body. When I realized It was the detergent, I stopped it immediately and although the symptoms subsided, after a week, I still had severely irritated patches of skin in my bra and panty areas. Because I cannot take Antihistamines, everything I tried had to be topical and NOTHING helped. After three weeks of torture, and no logic to support why Olivella would work when the prescribed creams didn't,I gave it a try. WELL, after just one day the itching was gone. After three days, the rough dry areas were back to normal color and by the end of the week, all symptoms were completely gone. I've used a lot of olive oil products but the virgin oil moisturizer is by far, a must-have."
2,Caused irritation!,"After reading all the great reviews about this product, I was surprised at how badly it irritated my skin. My skin is very sensitive and obviously it works for some, just not for me. But, you do get a lot of product for a very reasonable price."
5,"Good product, natural.","it is good for everyday use. and it is nature, I used it on face everyday ,and it is neither oily or dry, I recommend it !"
2,made me break out,"I was disappointed, it felt lovely on the skin and has a nice scent but this product made me break out on my face and neck. Granted, I have sensitive skin - so take that with a grain of salt."
2,Doesn't work for me,"After reading the positive reviews about this product, I decided to give it a try. I like the fact that it's all natural and it's not tested on animal. However, when I put it on my face, I felt burning sensation on my cheeks and my skin turned red. Now I use Aveeno moisturizer and my skin feels much better."
2,So disappointed,"I searched Amazon high and low for a moisturizer without toxic ingredients, and since so many manufacturers don't include ingredients on their product descriptions I was unable to make an educated decision. I am hoping to have another baby and recent studies suggest that women who are pregnant, or trying to get pregnant, should avoid retinyl palmitate. I went with Olivella because the bottle said 100% Virgin Olive Oil. I have been using it for the past week, and imagine my surprise when I glanced at the ingredients list to see what they had used to scent the oil (because it doesn't smell like olive oil) and found, among other things, retinyl palmitate! Not exactly 100% virgin olive oil! While there might be a small amount of vitamin A in olive oil, it seems that they have added more (as well as citrus oil, and a number of flower oils that provide its pleasant fragrance). I am sorely disappointed!"
2,Good idea not executed very well...,"Olive oil is indeed very good for you, whether taken internally or slathered on the skin. The price for this brand of skin oil is better than that of DHC, but the citrusy fragrance and spout that spits out more than I need are definite minuses. Otherwise it's a decent moisturizer."
3,Nothing special,"I don't think this product is very good for an older person (59) with dry skin. It seems to just evaporate off the surface and leaves my skin looking very dry in the morning. It might be good for cleansing or using with another product over it. I will not buy it again and have to look for something else. The scent is a little bit strong for sensitive people, also."
2,Why buy this...when you can use straight up Olive Oil!!,"Unless you have the dryest of all dryest skin types...dont go for this! im sure its good for those with dry/flaky skin..but even then...you can only dab a bit of this. I have combination skin..but bought it as an overnight moisturizer..since it is known to be a great anti-oxidant....but what happened instead was I put a small amount over my face, and neck, and my hair kept getting stuck on my face because it was soooo thick! it was like putting pure Olive Oil on my skin....really thats all it really is!! Again...I wont knock it for those who have ultry-dry skin...but wearing an itty-bitty amount is good. Or..you can just buy olive oil and do it yourself ;)"
2,Quite Disappointed,"The product claims ""Magnificent anti-aging Elixir truly replenishes and revitalizes your skin while your body is at rest, during sleep."". I actually found that skin looks worse. I am suspect that many of the reviews (like many on Amazon) are written by the company. It does nothing for my skin.If I want to buy a natural product, I find Wholefoods a much better resource. The staff tends to be knowledgeable and quite honest."
2,hopelessly limited,"The Seiko dictionaries have gone down in price everywhere. That's because of the new Franklins with the Bookman cards. You can't expand this dictionary in any way. It has more functions, but they're not very useful (how often do you need to know your shirt size in Spain?). It's better than nothing, but not too much."
2,Disappointing,"I ordered the book thinking that I had found a good resource for starting my event planning business. What I received was a book that would be great for people who organize fund raising events with several committees of people working together. Not at all what I was looking for. In fact, most of the book is related to fundraising and the responsibilities of the various committee members. Overall, I was disappointed in the lack of general event planning information and ideas."
2,It's for fundraisers! Not events! Just fundraisers!,"When I bought this book I thought it was about planning different kinds of events, fundraisers included. Turns out it's all about fundraisers. Which is fine, but I wish they'd said so ON THE COVER so I wouldn't wasted my money. The info is good for fundraisers, but pretty much irrelevant for any other kind of big event."
2,Not a good resource for General Event Planning,"Too specific to charity. Not generalized enough to perform in a ""normal"" situation. Was disappointed with the read."
1,A must-not buy,"Funimation really botched its bluray release of FMAB. Not only is the video sub-part for bluray and the subtitles poor (as usual), but subtitles are NON-SELECTABLE, like something out of the Dark Ages. You canh have English audio with NO subtitles or Japanese audio with FULL subtitles. You can not have English audio with signs&songs subs or full subs, and you cannot hve Japanese audio with no subs, for those who know the language well. This is a ridiculous choice on Funimation's part, and means that the blurays are a complete waste of money. I will wait for years if necessary for a PROPER bluray release of this excellent series. Do not waste money on THIS release. Hold Funimation to account. Make them improve their quality by withholding your money from them."
4,great buy for sustain the industry,"to be honest i wish it came with the post cards because i love the art, but other than that it was a great pruchase. well worht the money. i love Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood!"
4,broken item promptly exchanged,received broken due to improper packing - received exchanged item promptly
4,Beware of hot handle,"This is a good looking kettle of quality stainless steel. But the handle does not at all stay cool as stated in the description--you must use a potholder. (The enclosure with the kettle even states this.) The whistle is pretty feeble. However, we are stainless steel freaks and like the kettle anyway. The shape makes it easy to clean. The insert says you shouldn't let water stand in it or it might rust slightly--a minor annoyance."
4,Awesome,I just love the chipmunk movies. They are just right for children to watch. It is nice that they have the double feature in one dvd case.
4,Alvin & the Chipmunks Scare-Riffic Double Feature,Grandkids loved it! They loved the original movie and wanted to see more of the chipmunks.
5,Alvin and the chipmunks scare riffic double feature,It was so funny and I loved the songs they sould do one with Dracula!
4,my young kids love chipmunks wolfman.,"We don't have chipmunks frankenstein but my girls ages 3,5,and 7 have seen the wolfman one a lot. They love it."
5,A quiet and engaging film,"I don't remember how I stumbled across this film, but the first time I watched it I was extremely impressed. It is a beautiful, quiet, and subtle film exploring the subject of dealing with death, both within Japanese society, and for humans in general."
5,Creative and tender! Beautifully done film.,"I highly recommend this DVD. A wonderful job of directing and acting! It lets you think and absorb. A must see,"
1,"Defective disk and BIG problem getting replacement,.","I rated it a one because I received a disk that would not play anything. I reported as defective. I was given a replacment shipping date of January 3, to be received around the 8th. When I called, I was told they had NO idea when this would come in. I received no emails that there was a problem getting a replacement disk. The only good thing is I'm getting a refund with a ""promise"" I will be notified when I can attempt to reorder again. I really, really wanted this movie. This has not been a good experience. This DVD was suppose to be a Christmas present, Ugh!"
3,"Good, not excellent","A good movie with some interesting characters (e.g. the boss) that could have deserved deeper picturing. I found Masahiro Motoki's play not very expressive, which is no good for some scenes that could have been poignant. The movie is good otherwise, but don't expect ""award-winning"" quality: it is good, not excellent."
5,A Masterpiece,"A lengthy review is not required for this film. It was simple, profound and beautiful.I consider myself to be a hard and somewhat jaded man, having survived war and traveling far in my life. This film awakened long-buried emotions.I wept."
5,Passion,"A lovely film showing what can happen when passion, talent and position all come together in the same place. This movie is currently on Netflix instant queue. Watch it"
5,Departures,"I saw Departures at the City of Tacoma, Washington's annual Sister Cities International Film Festival as the entry from Kitakyushu, Japan. I was not aware that Departures had been awarded the Oscar for the best foreign language film in 2009. To say the film was stunningly beautiful is an understatement. Director Yohiro Takita's comments explain how the film's beauty was thoughtfully played out. Takita expressed that he was surprised that the film got such wide approval outside of Japan."
2,Subtitle troubles keep this from 5 stars.,"First off, let me just say that I DO love this film. I saw it when it reached my local art-house theater, and I thought it was a fantastic motion picture. If this review was just for the film, I would easily give it five stars.Sadly, the DVD has one glaring issue that, to me, is a major annoyance. On the English subtitle track (the only one, I might add) for the film, sound effect descriptions are included. Now I understand that such items are necessary for closed-captioning and English SDH subtitles -- but not for regular translations of dialogue and text/signs from one language to another. They certainly aren't used in theatrical subtitles of foreign-language films. Some people may not mind one way or another, but I don't need to be notified all of the time when [chime rings] or [door closes] or [mutters to self].If there is anyone at E1 Entertainment, or whoever published and distributed this in the US, I ask of you: please find some way to correct this."
1,"item was defective, and had to return it.","The 1star review is not for the movie itself, but rather, the disc itself. It was broken, and couldn't get to watch the movie. I know it was used, but it had a fairly big scratch, and was bad enough that it couldn't be read by the player. I had to send it back."
1,Departures,"It stated that the Departures movie had english subtitles. When it does not.It is in Japanese, maybe Chinese. Was happy to recieve and unhappy to see there was no english anywhere on the video."
1,Ice therapy,"Not what I expected at all. See the picture? it looks like you freeze water and then it was a clear cap to hold the ice. Not really, once you remove the blue cap the ice is applied directly to the skin (ouch) and when you try to put the blue cap back after it is frozen it does not tighten properly. Messy. A bag of ice does a better job."
4,Love is Spirit Centered and I love this book,"All relationships that are spirit centered have a greater chance of success. Couples who are committed to their spiritual growth will enjoy Spirit Centered Relationship and find helpful tools. Learning to be present is a helpful tool for relationships and life mastery. I offer couples retreats in Sedona, Arizona and this book along with others by Gay and Kathryn are on the required reading list."
5,#1,"Gay and Katie have done it again! I loved Spirit-Centered Relationships and the new topic of presencing! The information taught in this book has changed my life and relationships so much! I really appreciated the CD included with the book, making quick reviews easy."
3,satisfied,"This set is good and affordable. I'm able to fall right on the knee pads and don't feel the impact...but there is a velcro strap on the top of the knee pad and it never stays closed. It is too small. However, you don't need it at all, they stay up without it. They are comfortable and I'd recommended them."
3,Nice,There's great new age and there's good. This is good. Transaction went fine. Got a smile and would do it again.
5,Great album,Just arrived in mail. I find the music very inspirational. It helps me when I study or work on my paintings. Great for those long autumn evenings when you feel like reflecting on things.
2,Not as good as the first two,"I bought this based on the experience I had with the first 2 albums. However, this album did not make me think, fly, or move like the first 2 albums did. Those ones sorta told a story, and they pleased me greatly. This album was like, BLEH. Too many woodwinds and not enough ""kick"". I was still waiting for the ""redeeming"" track when... the CD was done playing. I was like, that's it? Huh.Still, it had 2 or 3 catchy tunes that make the CD worth KEEPING, but not necessarily BUYING. The bottom line though, is that everyone has their own tastes."
3,Too Slow,"This book might be well written, but it was too slow and boring. I thin it did not take on the real stuggle of the husband and wife. I did not feel for anyone except the Rita the Grandmother. The story of Young Taylor really did not develop and I felt I was forcing myself to finish. Read this if you have nothing better to do, but there are far better novels out there."
4,Reader friendly and entertaining,"This book is well illustrated. Very easy to follow visually, unlike most books of this kind. The ""Cunning Stunts"" are refreshingly above average."
5,Ellie-Ellie's People,"""Ellie""(Ellie's People-Book 1) mentions what is like to grow up in an Amish family, and anyone who is interested in the Amish culture should read this book. Mary Christner Borntrager is a wonderful author."
2,didn't work that well,"i got these for making pumpkin pie crusts. it didn't work that well, the crust bubbled up around the chain."
5,Hot Women: CALIENTE!!!,"Hot Women is a phenomenal selection of really old-sounding world music. Each song is hand picked by Crumb! There is gorgeous artwork throughout, and the CD is really fun to listen to. Spice up your next party with this CD, I did! It rocks!"
5,simply the best !,I live in california wich means I have to travel a lot of hours by plane. I know every song this guy has recorded by heart! So please listen yo me when I say it just cannot get any better than this one. If you buy it and dont like it send it to me and Ill give you full price for it.
5,Excellent book for the best Buffy season,"Season six is in my opinon the best Buffy season ever.If you don't like it read this book. It will change your mind.If it doesn't, then go back to watching Bewitched or Buffy season one. I guess the true spirit of the Slayer is lost on you."
5,as described,The product arrived in a timely manner and as described. I would do business with this vendor again.
3,Destilando Amor,Loved the soundtrack. It was like watching the novela except without having to deal with the teasing snippets of the songs!
1,Nothing Rare Here!,"I just saw these ridiculous prices from marketplace sellers here! There is nothing rare about this single - THAT would be the ""Good Thing"" single, which was pressed in only 1000 copies by mistake. This one was mass-produced. Don't be ""duped"" here, folks!- A Saint Etienne fan and collector."
2,Overall basic .NET text covered & lack professionalism,"This book does a fair job of covering most aspects of VB.NET in a simple and easy to understand text. Book does lack professional coding examples, Object-oriented chapter is about 18 pages while chapter on .NET family servers is over 20 pages, there is no CD in the book. Overall this book is for newbees. I personally like the Visual Basic .NET from Francesco Balena."
4,An excellent read,I received From the Motherland to the Mothership and was extremely excited. The book was in perfect condition. I was recommended to read the book and I was glad that I listened. This book is exciting and informative and I highly recommend the book to anyone interested in other world experiences. The author describes her experiences using great detail and I appreciated the authors positive point of view.
1,Ludicrous to the point of hilarity,"This book has no proof of ANY kind to back up it's completely insane claims. It claims that Mars (the planet!) is solely inhabited by black people. I have seen these two ladies (the authors) on TV and they are clearly out to make a buck, at the expense of looking like complete loonies. Do they even believe what they wrote? That is very, very unlikely. The book's price is as insane as the authors claims. This is not recommended. It's an expensive joke, no matter what your race."
4,Great spare filter.,"I LOVE my Surround Air but with a huge hairy dog and living in a rural area, the purifier gets a real workout. The purifier tells you when the filter needs to be changed when a light comes on in the front. I was a bit concerned when I ordered the filter because one reviewer said it didn't fit property. Thankfully that was not my experience. The filter was a perfect fit and a GREAT deal. I'm going to keep a spare at all times! Oh - don't forget to reset the filter on the air purifier!!"
3,I bought this as a replacement part for the air purifier.,This was a replacement part for the air purifier. I bought it as an extra one to have on hand in case the company changed replacement parts later. I wouldn' t be able to get one then.
3,Good intro book,"I bought this book expecting to get a football playbook. Well, I got some football plays, but not a full playbook. If you're new to football then this book would be for you. I got what I was looking for in [...] . They offer a pretty solid offensive and defensive playbook. If you are a rookie then get this book, but for us veterans the [...] or equivalant is more our speed..."
4,Pretty neat old book.,"There are some awesome plays in this book. Probably a bit too advanced for youth football, but with a little tweaking, a lot of plays can be good ones for even that level of football."
5,Asa new coach it helped creat my playbooks,"This book was simple to understand, helped me create my own hybrid play book, and is applicable from flag through High school levels of play."
2,Misses the mark,"This book has no real audience. It is so basic that a high school coach would find it pretty useless, but uses terminology that a beginner would find hard to follow. In the front of the book and then again in the back it gets into some basic explanations of terminology but not enough to help with too many of the plays in the book.The copyright is 1995. So much of what is covered can be easily found on websites these days. Complete offenses are available for free on a dozen sites I can think of off the top of my head. Don't waste your money on this one."
3,This is NOT a playbook!,"This book is a collected work of the most successful football plays from a variety of systems. If you purchase this book, as I did, looking for a PLAYBOOK you will be sorely disapointed.The individual plays are well diagrammed and explained, as well as the philosophy behind their use, but there is no consistency within the book. You could not, for example, take this document to your football practice and install the plays with your high school team and expect to have a successful offense.Rather, if you are running an offense SIMILAR to the offense of one of the coaches who contributed to the book, then you may find ONE OR TWO plays that you can add to your existing system. This is a far cry from being a ""playbook"" as the title claims.I do not recommend this book for any coach below the high school level, or for parents wishing to learn the sport better. You will only be confused."
3,"Okay, but has some issues","I use this charger/transmitter with my iPod Shuffle and it works, but there are some major issues:1 - The instructions were useless. Took us awhile to get it working.2 - As others have mentioned, it sticks straight out of your outlet and takes up a bit of room which can be very inconvenient.3 - In my truck it comes loose every time I hit a bump."
5,love it!,what a hidden gem i stumbled upon on amazon.he sounds like belle n sebastian writes like morrissey.his singles have acoustic versions of his album tracks which is nice.dios lo bendiga.
5,Will change your view of Lord of the Rings,"This is a set of short excerpts from Lord of the Rings read by Tolkein himself. It is difficult to understand at times, and the characterization is very different than any of the attempts at making movies or audio books. In particular Tolkein's image of how Gollum spoke is very different than Hollywood's.This is probably not a record for everyone. Collectors and Tolkein fans, however, will find a great deal of interest in it.Highly recommended."
3,Lacking,"No research to back opinion... Lacking a framework. Fun to read and sounds warm and fuzzy, but..."
3,good looking but loose frame and not functional,"as a fashion accessary, it ia ok.But frame is loose so if you look down, you may drop it( I did 3 times )Lens are too small which looks nice but UV protection is weak."
2,"Well, it's fun and has good information","A fun, chatty little book; a cook wanting 'the facts, ma'am, only the facts' may find it uncomfortably conversational. The recipes are apparently based on small ""regular"" household kitchenware pots, hence the warnings about doubling recipes. Authoress does not have full confidence in thermometer temperatures, and recipes are not given in weights or percentages as in a professional or European cookbook. The paper is pulp. For what it is, other people might rate it 3 stars or howbeit. 'There is no accounting for taste' -- one person's flippancy may be another's fudge."
1,Disgusted,How this book ever made it to print is beyond me. Not one single recipe in it works...not one. It was a monumental waste of money and effort. Disappointing.
5,A Rare Portrait of an Historic Region,"There are very few books published on Karabagh (Artsakh). The author discusses the events leading up to the war from both Armenian and Azerbaijani perspectives. Unlike other books which tend to be dry historical accounts, this book presents the rich culture and history of the region and how and what conditions led to the war and what possibilities if any exist for peace in the region. Highly recommended."
2,Only for reference,"As others have mentioned, de Waal's book has two major flaws: moral relativism, and unfair comparisons. The positive things about the book are that it has interesting interviews with key people who were involved with the conflict, and it's chronology of events from 1988 till Key West meetings in 2001. I would have given the book a better rating had the author's concluding chapter not been so hunky dory, nor so gloomy of the decision by Armenians and Azerbaijanis to not accept the terms from the Key West meetings. On the one had he chastised President Kocharyan and Dictator Aliyev for not telling their people about the deal, i.e. no transparency, but then he criticizes the people for refusing to accept the Minsk Group's suggestions. In sum, have this book for a reference, but don't take this as the definitive book on the Karabakh War."
2,The title is misleading.,Please beware the title on this video. It is misleading because there are 8 different episodes on this disc. One of them is Clifford's Halloween. The other 7 episodes can be watched for free on WTTW Channel 11.
3,RCBS power bullet puller,"The RCBS works just as advertized. Easy to use and sturdy. I re-seated approx. 200 bullet I set to deep and used this puller to pull them out and re-seated to spec.Shop-You can beat the price with simular product. If I could not find one at a better price I would purchass another RCBS. This is sturdy enough I won't need to buy another. The bullet holder is a little weak and over time I have broken the holding edges off of the bullet holder part which I do not know the name ,possably collet?"
4,Good supplement,"While this is not the best splat book form the line, owning the complete line of books was my goal. There were only six books written for the series and thios rounded out my collection. A must own for any SG1 fan and gamer like me."
3,"IS OK TO READ IT,December 26","genao from New York city,ny usaIn the pearl by Joohn Steinbeck.The main charaters are kino and juana.they live in a brush house near to the sea in Baja California,they have a son name coyotito and the only possesion is a cano.the cano was heven by his feather.one day,coyotito get stung by a scorpion.kino and juana donot have money to pay the doctor so kino and juana go to search for the pearl that might be.I will give three stars to this book because the book is not a storyline and because i like the end.I will recommend it.because the pearl doesnt bring happiness but it bring other thin to the family.If you want to now the end read the book.I recommend you to read this book.?"
4,jfish1972,"Just received this product and fit directly on my 115hp Yammi. I was able to install my cotter pin for added reassurance. Have not taken it out for a test drive, but will keep you all posted."
5,Westie Lover,"Having two Westies of my own, I was sure that David Shannon was writing about mine. He definetely knows what Westies are like right down to the precious smile on their faces. It is an adorable book for all, but especially the Westie Lover. Thank you David Shannon for making my day with your wonderful book."
5,Kids love this book,"I have a German Shepherd [definately not a little dog] but my grand-daughter loves the book AND I have to read it again, again and--well we all know what it means to have a special book. This is the perfect book for all who love and spoil their dog."
5,He is a good boy!,"Another good entry from David Shannon. I gave this to my neice for her birthday and her older sister, just out of kindergarten sat down and read it to all of us. Keep up the good work."
2,Good Boy Fergus,I thought this book was ok. I really liked the pictures but i thought that it was quite difficult to understand the meaning and story line of the book. It was a book that you definatly had to read between the lines and really try to follow along. I had a bit of trouble reading it and i thought that it really wasn't the greatest book to read.
2,How do you read this book to your child?,"This is a strange book. A bunch of different words that is hard to link together. The picture does not respond to the words that are written. So, how can I teach my toddler words without confusing her? When I try to read this book to her she looks at me with a question in her eyes. Like 'what is this suppose to be or mean?' She loves dogs, but this book is too confusing... I would not recommend it and would not buy it again myself. We DO love Diaper David books, though."
3,Feeds dog from the table,"My 16 month old son absolutely loves this book. We have a dog that he calls ""good girl"" and I thought this book would be a perfect fit for him since it goes through Fergus' day. Unfortunately, he related a little too well to it. At one point in the story, the adult is sitting at the dinner table and Fergus is begging for some food. At first the adult tells Fergus not to beg, but then he gives in and feeds the dog from the table saying ""Good boy Fergus"".Around the same time this book became my son's favorite, he also started throwing half of his meals on the floor so the dog could eat it. We have tried to stop him and tell him no, but he just laughs and continues to toss his food over the side. He used to do this when he was much younger, but we had broken the habit for many months until this book came along.It is a real shame too since he has already memorized some of the words. ""Cat!"" But, I can't keep the book around since it is teaching him such a bad habit."
5,So true! So funny!,After checking this book out from the library every-other-time we go. I decided it was time to have our own. My daughter loves dogs and this is a well illustrated book on life with a dog. She's only 15 months old but enjoys acting out Mr. Itchy Bobo Scratchity Man and panting with Fergus. Shannon has done a fabulous job on this book. The whole book is like a good joke! Its funny 'cause it true!
5,Fantastic!,"This book is hilarious. Totally engaging. The pictures are a joy to behold, and the antics of both Fergus and his owner will strike a chord with dog lovers. I laugh out loud everytime I read this. Kids will love the pictures but adults can apprectiate the message as well."
2,Not what I expected.,"Maybe I am just too picky, but I did not think this book would hold my granddaughters attention. About all I can say is that the pictures are cute. She is 3 1/2, not sure if it is just a bad age for this book or what."
4,Dog Desires Captured,"I thoroughly enjoyed Shannon's depiction of Fergus, a cute Westland Terrier who, through persistence, gets what he wants. The humor comes not only from the fact that Fergus is always the winner against the hapless owner, but from the fact that Fergus will remind parents of toddlers and children of a certain age. I wish, however, that the story was a bit less predictable."
5,The Hot Pot is a good buy.,"I have cooked with the Hot Pot for about a year now and it works very well. The large 5 quart system is large enough to cook most anything. I have given the Hot Pot as gifts and friends who have seen me cooking with it and have bought it, all agree, they are very happy with it."
1,One star courtesy of Amazon,"Normally, I would not watch or write a review for anything this bad. I was persuaded to watch this by someone that, apparently, didn't like me very much. Again, it's about a bunch of teenagers who apply for a reality TV contest and end up dying while someone with absolutely nothing else to do watches them. If you have absolutely nothing to do, do nothing, instead of watching this.All of the elements that make for good film making were violated by this thing. Poor acting, poor script, poor directing, etc. A partial head decap is the only thing that was halfway decent about this waste of time. Every 5 minutes will have you saying ""well that was stupid, what is she thinking, wtf, etc."" This was one stupid movie. Avoid it."
2,copycat of Saw,"*Are You Scared?* is a copycat of *Saw*. You could tell the moment that it started.6 teens are kidnapped to play their individual tailored game. They must complete the game in order to come out alive. These teens had videotaped themselves auditioning for a TV reality show. However, none of these teens never heard back from this TV show...until now.The only difference is that you get to see who is the mastermind behind these horror games.Other than that, it's just a copycat of *Saw* without the mastery of suspense."
2,:0<,"It's like a cheap water down version of Saw. Come on when they were doing this they had to say you know what it's exactly like that other movie. It's not bad-ish but i just kept comparing both films throughout watching this one. Group of people kidnap but in an abandon building and their worst fare comes true, it's sounds different but looks the same as Saw."
3,"So its Saw-like, but still a pretty cool flik!","I was ok with this film. First off we have to get past the ""saw"" rip off scenario. Lion's gate also owns the Saw franchise, so of course they are going to cater to what people are into at the time. Basic marketing tactics..... but I like the saw films- so I dont mind seeing another one even if its under a different cover. The death scenes are clever and the film has it's share of a few good scares. So overall an enjoyable film. The characters are typical to what we are ""used"" to, so no problems there. Basically what we have here is a film dressed around the killing scenarios. Not too uncommon these days. I recommend it, believe me there are probably 20 other new horror releases on your local rental shelf that you could be alot more disappointed it. (eyesofchaos dot com)"
2,SAW rip-off... not great at all....,ARE YOU SCARED? is just overall a SAW rip-off... its about 6 young people wanting to be in the reality spotlight so bad that they will do anything. so they are kidnapped into this warehouse and are forced to play in this reality game show fighting for there lives.i think it would have been a little better if they did not release this movie around the time SAW was really huge! the only reason i gave this movie 2 stars was because how they kept the story line in tact and it didnt get to ignorant......2 stars out of 5: completley pathetic
2,"Obvious Rip-Off of ""Saw""","Are You Scared is an unapologetic copy of ""Saw"": Same plot, lower budget. The direction is poor and the whole film has a grainy look to it. I give it an extra star for ripping off a decent horror film.Another 2nd rate, Lions Gate cheapo-deluxe movie."
2,Disapointing,The movie could have been really good...but the acting was very bad. Wasn't as entertaining as I hoped it would be.
2,"Ah, no...not scared","As many have pointed out, 'Are You Scared' is, indeed a 'Saw' rip-off. In 'Saw' lessons were being taught and the victims were chosen for specific reasons. And it was possible to survive Jigsaws traps. The victoms of 'Scared' were conned into thinking they were just on reality tv. Yet this was pretty much a straight 'revenge' flick with groovy toys and some gore. I actually found it a bit boring, it took me 3 times to get thrugh it. My advice, don't bother. (Oh, any else notice a nod to 'Seven')"
3,Sexy but flawed,I bought this watch for my boyfriend 2 christmases ago. He wore it for about a year. It is a beautiful watch and looks amazing on him. Love the styling but the band broke after one year of part-time wear. The rubber clasp does not last. Now i am having trouble finding a replacement. I found one on line and it is $55. Unfortunate.
4,Good Installation Kit..,"This is the first time that I bougth an Automotive's accesory, It's great!! I found anything that I need..I installed the kit without problems.."
5,For Hags Everywhere.,"I gave this set 5 stars only because it doesn't go higher.This is an outstanding collection of the Hag's early work. Much of his Talley recordings are here as well as his capitol.It covers 1962-1968 It is a great companion to his ""Down Every Road"" Which focus on his later work. Some of the hightlights are the false starts which give you a tiny peak into the recording session. Hag's voice was just as rich then as it is now."
3,Don't sell your vinyl yet!,"As nice as it is to have this classic of British blues back in print again, this is still the ""edited"" version with songs that fade out long before the versions to be found on the Warners, RAK or Metronome vinyl issues of the Bootleg Him! albums do. There is no excuse for lopping off the last two minutes of songs and Wounded Bird have just continued the laziness of the previous Line and Castle cd issues. Great music... butchered."
2,bootleg him,"loved the song operator w/robert plant,the rest of cd was so-so. it is worth it for that song because of led zeplin."
5,Just what we wanted,"This book is just what we wanted. We are planning a car trip following the Oregon Trail from Missouri to our home state, Idaho. This book contains information and maps which tells where to go and what to look for."
5,love this creme,This lotion has a great smell and i love the healing effects of zinc. easy pop up dispensing cap and great sizi i can throw it in my gym bag if need be!
1,it taste very bad,"it is the worse gluten free pasta ever it taste Very badi waited a long time for OrgraN to produce Spaghettiit is a great company for gluten free pasta it has many kinds of good tasty pastabut OrgraN Spaghetti is the worsethey must improve itfor Spaghetti lovers i recommendSchar Naturally Gluten-Free Spaghetti, 12-Ounce Packages (Pack of 5)"
5,A voice of reason,"Finally, clear, direct words on positively transforming people and environments. Poisant's style is warm and simple; the power of his words, however, cut to the chase--either you're doing it or your not. It's that simple. This is a book that can be easily read in one sitting--and change your way of behaving forever!"
5,Back To The Basics Of Providing Great Customer Service,"This book is a ""fun"" read that reminds us of the primary elements that are required to provide outstanding customer service on an ongoing basis. Meaningful examples and illustrations gained from real world work experiences enables the reader to understand how following familiar principles can achieve the desired service results. Again we find that people on the front line being properly trained and treated fairly can make all the difference! Recommened ""Must Read For Managers""."
5,"Something for ""oldtimers"" and beginners too","As a professional turner with 52 years experience, I find much in this book that I like. Many of Mike's methods I have used and, many I have not. Now that I'm retiring, I shall turn for fun with the help of this book."
2,Foul smell,"We enjoyed our first Fox book, Fox on the Job, but Fox All Week is notably less enjoyable for two reasons: 1) it is much less funny and 2) one of the stories shows Fox and his friends smoking cigars. Marshall tries to treat the subject with intended humor, but it is lost on children ages 4-8. This age group is not able to understand such tongue-in-cheek humor until older and the result of the cigar smoking story is confusion about whether smoking is OK for kids."
1,Short Story about Fox Smoking,"I am so mad after reading half of this book with my daughter who is in First grade. She comes home with Advanced Reader books that she can read and then test on. In the middle of the book we find a story titled ""Thursday After School"". They come across Cigars and decide to smoke them. The con? Two of them get sick for one hour(That's it) and they finish off the story with one of the boys still smoking because he thinks it makes him look smart. Seriously? It left both of us mad."
1,Teach your preschool to smoke,What a terrible book. Fox and his friends light up mid-way through the book. I'm not sure why people like these Fox books. Fox is disrespectful to his mother and resents spending time with his little sister. Is this really what you want to be teaching your kids?
5,Terrific,"I can listen to this CD all day. She touches the soul like few others can. If you have never listened to Tish before, now is the time. Culture Swing is also outstanding, but this is one of the great CD's out there. Treat yourself."
5,"gracias, Tish",if you never heard that voice before- buy this cd. if you have a heart it will convert you. her singing is beautiful and so are the words. there are really few artists like Tish- Townes Van Zandt is another one
3,Nice for the price,This set is what you should probably expect for the price. It is not top quality but it gets the job done. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a very basic set for their fire place.
3,Fireplace Tool Set,"My item arrived very promptly. My poker set was a little bit different than the picture on the box. The section which holds the rods was curved instead of a straight bar. This was minor because the stand does hold the utensils in place. Other than that, it was a good deal for the money."
4,Great Fireplace poker set,Bought this over a year ago. Works great. Don't let the plastic broom socket get too close to the fireplace as it will melt. Other tools are built very sturdy. Use it often.
3,Passable,Its ok. Thats about it. If you don't want to spend more than 25 dollars on fireplace tools it does the job. You have to screw in all the pieces and I notice at times the part that holds them up keeps getting loose. It is frustrating at times.
3,Gift for friend,"I purchased this as a gift for a friend, who received it and told me it worked fine. Never saw it myself...."
4,Good Student Guide and Invaluable Refrence,"As one of the countless professionals dealing with rolling out NT4 in the workplaceand as a student preparing for the Microsoft Exams, this book is currently never farfrom my desk.The authors manage to impart a great deal of knowledge in an easy style that isvery readable but not simplistic. The book deals with the NT in a methodical mannerand covers all aspects fairly reasonably. There are some areas that, in my opinon,that are glossed over lightly, (eg NTFS structure and security). However, consideringthat at this time the Course and Test for NT Workstation 4 has not been finalized byMicrosoft, the authors do a very creditable job.The true test of any Study Guide is if it helps the student pass the exam - I'll keep youposted"
3,Not so good,This book is not for beginners. Within the first few pages of the book there were typos found. You need some experience with NT to understand the concepts because they are laid out in an unclear and unconcise format. I would not recommend relying on this book to pass the exam. This book would be good as a supplement in your studies.
2,SO SO not much help,"I bought the sybex CORE REQUIREMENTS and on the package it said ""everything you need to pass the mcse exams"" and the cd comes up short..the final question is about logging to NT which is covered in the first and second chapters.Where's the rest of the interaction? And yes I to have found errors-lots of them. I havent taken the test yet but I am thinking I wasted my money...because I went through the book and my retention of the material didn't last. And the worst thing of all I am NOT rich..poor even so every dollar counts,and there is no training centers in my area."
2,A lot of errors,This book contains a lot of errors. You can use this book to start with NT Workstation but is not enough to pass the MCP (MCSE) test. Don`t use this book if you don`t want to waste your time. Beware of errors!
2,Full of errors,This book is full of errors. Some of the multiple-choice options are repeated in the same question; in one case the answers in the back don't match the questions in the front. I have spotted a few glaring errors in the early chapters.My confidence rating in this book is low.
3,Hupe it Up,"This is a long book, and the action is tense, packed and labyrinthine at times... but overall a good read. If you like Frank Herbert you will mostly likely enjoy Huperum. The author does a serviceable job of projecting the conflicts between a colonialist Earth that no longer holds the monopoly on what is ""right"" -- and the adventures of a strong-willed man, Keef Terrason who is hell bent on teaching both the colony and his colonialist masters a lesson or two.Worth the extra money for the deluxe oversize paperback."
5,Exciting novel that you just won't put down,"This book has it all - murder, love, mystery, and intrigue in a science fiction setting. It kept me up at night as I got throughly involved with Keef, his friends, and his enemies. You won't be disappointed. It's easy and enjoyable reading for all ages."
4,a classic formula that continues to work,"The only reason I couldn't give this one 5 stars in the length of the disc. Besides the San Francisco Knights remix, every track on here emphasizes what the PUTS do best: combine classic vinyl-sampled loop beats with catchy intelligent rhymes. The subject manner isn't as deep as some other lesser-known hip hop notables (ala, Talib Kweli), but the lyrics are sure to entertain anyone looking for quality classic hip-hop. Standout tracks include Outrun, Roadbeaters (which uses the same sample as Reflection Eternal's ""Memories Live"")and the OST remix. If your a PUTS fan, be sure to add this to your collection, as this album certainly shows off a style that is tried and true."
4,The PUTS serve it up again...,"Or Stay Tuned is really more of a mini album or an EP perhaps, but it's still got some great tracks that you won't find anywhere else. If you are a PUTS fan you will like this album, and the only dissapointment is the length of it, but I'm sure Thes One and Double K are cooking up something new right now. This album is only an appetizer. Highights of the album are The jazzy sounds of ""Plunken' Em"" and the incredible smoothness of ""LA Song (Sensitive Mix)"". So, the bottom line is: buy this if you love the PUTS. It's a good buy for the money."
4,Good Action Movie!,"This was a good action movie that wound up to be very entertaining. Two officers from World War II,one Japanese,one German, stage a Karate tournament.One is trying to best the otherin this contest. You have a widw range of fighters who participate in this tournament.You are treated to some excellent karate action. In the background you have several conspariciestaking place between the forces of good and the forces of evil.Watch this movie. You will be greatly entertained."
3,"Decent tea, but lots of packaging","The tea itself is pretty good -- very smooth, sturdy flavor. Not too much to say about that part.However, I hadn't entirely appreciated how much packaging was involved -- this is a big box of organdy (that is, cotton) teabags, each of which is sealed in a hefty plastic bag. I was expecting something more modest and more readily recyclable."
4,Extravagant? Yes! Good tea? Yes!,The tea is excellent. Assam tea is a smooth but hearty black tea. I am a bit disappointed in the excessive packaging. I bought this as a gift for my daughter and was delighted to find it once again with free shipping on Amazon. This is a special tea and makes a wonderful treat or a gift.
3,Too Light,Too Light..I wanted something stronger. It is good for having without milk. I prefer to have it with milk. That is why I didnt like it.
1,Be warned!,"These bumpers suck! I spent a ton on both a front and back Warn bumper from another seller. I have 33"" tires on my Rubicon so I needed the tire carrier as well. After one year the powder coating started flaking off both bumpers. One year! Then the rear tire swing arm started seizing up even though I lubed it every time I changed the oil. I have to disassemble it every year to scrape and polish and relube. It has also never shut properly. I have to lift on the end while I close it to get it to latch and most times I have to kick it. This was installed by a reputable mechanic who worked with me to try to get a replacement after I brought it back after the first year but to no avail. Considering the amount I spent on these 3 pieces, I am very upset they would not make it right. I love my Warn winch, but will NEVER buy anything from them again. It's been 5 years since I bought these and they are the worst looking parts on my jeep. Rust everywhere."
5,Good book,Being an advanced programmer I was looking for books to use as references or to further my skills. This book has proven a valuable asset.
3,it is okay,"too harash on truth but i don't agree with everything book say abt haircare esp. for organic , she would say it is no better than sythenic. I fell and laugh , thought she was crazy"
2,Useful for Beginners,"This is a helpful ""starter"" book for people who have no idea about hair care products and are looking for some suggestions. However, personal experience has led me to disagree quite a bit with the information and advice provided. Products grouped together that should work much the same worked very differently on me. The author makes her selections based on ingredients rather than use, and while this method is good, it is not perfect. In one instance, the author's recommendation for a very mild shampoo irritated my scalp. Also, I have found that in almost all cases, salon products work better for me than do drugstore products. In conclusion, I would say that following the author's advice has had negative results for me."
2,Disappointed in NY,"I've enjoyed Paula's makeup books, so I thought I'd give this one a try. WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!!some of the information was contradictory and some down right wrong. This book was a waste of my time and money."
1,Terrible book,This book isnt worth the money you pay for it. It's only the ladys negative opinions on EVERYTHING without any facts or real information.
2,Curly hair customers be warned,"This was a good Item but better for normal/straight hair care, I have curly hair and only a chapter was reserved for curly hair/African american hair. I was really disappointed in it and I was kind of hoping for information on ALL hair types not just focusing on one. the reason I gave it 3 stars is because it does have some good recommendations to some products."
4,Wont buy haircare products again as I did before...,"A very detailed book with a lot of experiences and observations, a lot. The reviews fit the US market for haircare products better than the European, but even then very very relevant. To some the book might be a bit on the detailed side, but I will never buy haircare products I did before I read the book. -And, by the way, my hair is doing a lot better nowadays... :)"
5,I love Paula!,"I love this book!!! It talks about basic principles and also a lot of myths are being shattered! Very much recommended. It also has reviews of various brands. I ended up using the cheapest shampoo out there and that does the job & doesn't cause build up! plus I barely have any dandruff anymore (used to use head and shoulders and it created a worse problem)...and shampoo I use now isn't even for dandruff issue yet it works!! I stopped using hair dryer and flat iron and my hear stopped breaking! It's amazing what you think is a good brand based on their ads and it's not that great, actually :) Love this book."
1,"NO INFORMATION FOR BLACK WOMEN, RACIST","This book is not for people of color. Paula Begoun only devotes 10 pages to information regarding black hair, and actually has the audicity to say, ""Suffice it to say that the natural state of black hair is currently not an acceptable fashion statement for women of color."" IS SHE CRAZY??? This statement is extremely offensive. (Would anyone ever say almond shaped eyes are unacceptable on asian people?) This is a part of our genetics and our looks. Does Paula notice all of the models, actresses, singers and even politicians who are black (women) who wear their hair natural??? Even white people and asian people try to braid/lock their hair to look like ours!! If she thinks natural black hair is unacceptable, then she should not write books abour hair care, and go live by herself on an island (which is obviously where she has been). Paula sweetie, stop sniffing hair care products..."
1,I think she got paid by Pantene!,"I read this book, and I must say, it seems that the only thing she likes is Pantene, and other like products. On every other page there is a reference to a product, but how Pantene is better. Are you kidding me!!!! Yuck! I think she seriously got paid off on this one. Cover to cover advertisements for a damaging horrrible product."
2,questionable marketing,"This is a useful book, primarily because it narrows your search and may save money. It's hard to tell whether her ratings are accurate- I am a researcher, and suspicious of one person's subjective research, so her conclusions must be accepted on faith. More importantly, the author suggests that readers can check out, on her website, newly rated products which didn't make it into her book. She doesn't tell you that you have to purchase this at the cost of another book. I found this deceptive. I wouldn't mind paying for ongoing reviews of new products, but I do mind being manipulated."
3,Room for Improvement,"Serious aficionados who watch Eleanor Powell movies want to see great dancing with the best legs God ever put on a lady dancer, good music,and at least a semi-credible plot. Ellie's Pin-ball dance is a classic, and the attending circus is eclecticly entertaining, and the finale sensational. (Ouch! with all those splits!) Alas, all the VHS tapes being sold as new are really 3rd or 4th generation copies that look to be seriously out-of-focus. All vendors get their copies from a single source. I bought two copies at different times and the quality is uniformly poor. The delicious Ellie Powell does more yakkin' than hoofin'and in group shots, one cannot discern facial features. Good, clear VHS copies of this movie are proably nowhere available. This would be four stars is if the video was clear. Those great legs deserve better."
1,no drivers,i purchased this product and found that there was not an installation disk supplied and the drivers are not available from the manufacturer. i own several hp products and in fact i installed this drive in a hp computer. i have never had this problem with any other hp products i have purchased. the drive is useless without the drivers. even my computer's search feature cannot find them. not very happy about this situation.
4,Important book if you want to know about Women's Movement,"I read several chapters of this book for research during a Middle Eastern Women's Studies class. Hilterman is very detailed about the activities of the women's committees and gives a thorough history of the Palestinian women's movement. I highly recommend this book for any Middle Eastern Women's studies class. It was not assigned reading for my class, but I think excepts from several chapters would be wonderful for class readings. Hiltermann even has a helpful index of organizations at the beginning of the book."
3,This book does NOT cover the full sized 84-on wagoneers!,Does not cover the full sized wagoneers that were produced the same years as some of the tiny little wanabe jeeps. I have an '84 full sized Wagoneer.
4,Can get the book at an auto part store cheaper.,It helped me to install a air/idle control valve on a 1987 Dodge Caravan. I did not even know where to find it.
5,GOOD PRODUCT,GREAT LOVED THEM WILL BE BUYING MORE SOON. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO OTHERS. PRODUCT WAS ALSO A GOOD PRICE
4,great training but hard to follow,"Dont get me wrong. The training is great and Chalene is amazing!! She has so much energy and put the work out fun!The only thing is that this work out is really hard for the knees so if you have weak knees or knee problem.. you have to be really careful when you do the work outAlso, there are so many cd's and they are all different, which is good, but the routines are kind of hard to follow and it goes so fast!!! Im in great shape, don't have any weight to loose, have done other products in the beachbody line but I think I will only keep my favorite Cd's and do a few in a week and incorporate to another program.What I like is the music and the impression you have is not working out but having fun.."
3,wanted to like it!!!!!,"I ordered this to change up my routine after doing P90X for a year. I really couldn't wait to start this program, but unfortunately it was extremely fast paced and I just couldn't keep up with the all the choreography. To be fair the DVD's did have a beginners segment, but I spent more time trying to figure out the steps then anything. Anyway I got very frustrated and sent it back. If you can keep up, Turbo Fire would definitely get you into great shape!"
3,DVD Quality is CRAP.,"Videos are good if you can actually get them to work. Some of them play, some don't. When they do - some you cannot select the ""Music fired up"" feature. Beachbody - work on your quality if you're going to charge so much!"
2,not a fan,I tried Insanity and loved it until my knees started to kill.Tried this work out with my fiance and this is by far the most dysfunctional workout Ive done. The videos training is lame and she doesn't really stress on working out the other side. Obviously its my own opinion but I could see it being fun if I kept replaying the tutorial to learn the moves.Over all it seems ok but way to cracked out for me. I was more frustrated after the 2nd time I tried it.overall opinion : MEH
4,Dig it,No doubt this will challenge you but you'll want to keep doing it because it's fun. I have a pretty good collection of exercise DVDs and Turbo Fire is now my favorite. Gave it a 4 instead of a 5 because I wish it came with more cardio DVDs vs. the stretch ones.
5,AMAZING!!!,this is the BEST workout ive ever done. very high intensity but really awesome and its really freaking fun! definatly worth it :)
3,turbo fire,"fast pace, difficult to follow all the moves when you are new to this program. when the option to see the low impact trainer is not clearly visable during the workout. Seeing the whole class in front of you is not easy to follow the routines."
3,FUN but Not for anyone with any kind of knee problem,"Great workout and lots of fun. However, it killed my knees after only a few workouts. I had to return it to Beachbody. I think the workouts are good but I would get bored with this after awhile. I just need more variety. Just can't commit to the program as it is laid out. Too repetitive and jerky on my knees. Feel it's a bit overpriced for what it actually is. Any Jillian Michaels, Jari Love, Cindy Whitmarsh, etc. Workouts can accomplish everything you need all in 45 minutes without all the jerking on my knees. It would be fun to do occasionally though."
5,Turbofire Rocks!,"I highly recommend this workout! It is a fast paced workout without a doubt but a fun one! You WILL see results within 3 months and actually before the 3 months. I am currently going to school for Nutrition Science and the food recommendations are spot on and have a great variety as well as the workouts keeping you going and to find out, one of my nutrition professors main workout is Chalene's Turbofire! I had no issues with the DVD's not working they worked and work like a charm! If you want a fun, fast paced workout (NOT BORING AT ALL) then try Turbofire, because Turbofire ROCKS!"
2,not impressed,"I got this workout after I got tired of doing Turbo Jam and Chalene Extreme. I stopped using it after a few weeks because the workouts are too dancy for me and take forever to figure out (I'm not very coordinated). They seem to focus on speed over form and I don't like that. To be fair, though, I didn't like Insanity either."
2,Turbo overload,"Chalene has great energy and enthusiasm, along with an awesome body. However, it is difficult to follow along with her moves and instruction. There is no strecth prior to the work out, which I feel is a very important part of cardio to prevent injury. I tried it for about two days before my patience wore thin. If you have a lot of time on your hands and you can commit to learning the moves then I'm sure you would reap the benfit. On the other hand, if your like me and want to insert a DVD and get right to it, then this isn't the video for you."
5,Great Workout,I have only used it twice so far because I just received it but it is pretty intense. I workout out about 6 days a week and think of myself as being pretty fit but the first day I got it I didn't have a lot of time so I only did the HIIT 15 and within the first few minutes I was already sweating. I am planning to do this program in the morning before I go to work then I will do weight training (2-3 a week) at night and also run (training) 3 nights a week. I think Charlene is great and the class keeps you interested. This is a kick-your-butt workout so if you're ready to sweat then get it. I think if you follow these workouts and also eat healthy you will def. see results. I am not looking to lose that much weight (maybe 5-7 pounds) but I really want to tone up more so doing this and weight training will really help me. Hope my review will help you with you decision.
3,Very intense and hard on the knees!,I have had knee issues lately and the turbo fire dvds really bother them so I do not do them much. This is a very intense workout program. Not for beginners. Luckily I have done a lot of turbo jam in the past so I know the moves but this is a little too intense for me right now. Disappointed because of how much I spent on this and also chalean extreme which I also do not care for. Turbo Jam was the original and the best IMO. I wish she could go back to that at least somewhat instead of being so hardcore now. Not everyone loves that.
3,Not happy with this purchase,I reviewed the DVDs and found that some of them kept skipping. This is not good for a effective workout.
1,"Very fast workout, slow refund if you return...","I ordered the product, gave it a shot. TurboFire just wasn't for me. I'm not super-coordinated, so I just can't keep up with a super fast-paced aerobic class kind of workout. I joked to a friend that maybe after a few espressos and some meth I could move that fast...I returned it within the 30 day window, and was assured a complete refund. I don't know what happened, but it took me an additional email and 2 telephone calls to receive a full refund. Maybe there was some inadvertant error on their part, I don't know."
4,Very repetitive,"This workout program is high intensity. The fire drills will definitely get your heart rate up, but I wouldn't recommend this workout to people with knee problems. There is a lot of jumping around. I also wouldn't recommend this program to people that have trouble sticking to workout programs because they get bored easily. TurboFire is very, very repetitive. They do the exact same moves over and over again in every single DVD. The only thing that varies is the order in which they do the moves and the length of the workouts. I don't know if this program actually works because I couldn't do it for more than 3 weeks. I got bored with it. However, I did notice that my cardio endurance improved, so maybe if I had stuck with it I would've lost weight too."
4,Great workout but KILLER ON THE KNEES,"I think the Turbo Fire workout is great. However, the warm up is almost non-existent. I would strongly recommend that people complete the 10 minute strench portion of the DVD BEFORE and AFTER the workout. It has really helped reduce soreness in my knees."
3,TurboFire,I have been a big fan of Turbo Jam for years and love all the programs Chalene comes out with. The music is great! If you have problems with your knees ( as I do) this is definitely not the program for you.. even modified puts a strain on the knees. Still a huge fan of Chalene & TURBO!
3,Some DVDs don't work,The workouts are great but several of the DVDs don't work. Pretty disappointing!! I've never had any problems with outside sellers on amazon until now.
2,Turbo Jam without the fun and good music,"I was a huge Turbo Jam fan and was excited to see something new. I didn't care for ChaLEAN extreme and I was hopeful that this had the same magic as TJ. I was really disappointed. A lot of canned disco Muzak, way too many implants, fake tans and hair extensions. Most of the moves that made TJ fun aren't there. It seems to be an attempt to combine Insanity and TJ and it fails miserably. On the bright side, it made me pull out my old TJ DVD's and I'm having fun doing those again. It's easy to up your own intensity with those and still enjoy it and not have all the knee issues that TF has."
2,Much easier than expected- too easy,I was suprised at how easy this was. I'm in decent shape but haven't worked out regulary in awhile so I thought I'd get a great workout from this. I've been very disappointed at how easy it is. Even the very high intensity workouts are unchallenging. I don't think this is for people who already work out.
1,DVD's don't work!!,"Got the DVD's yesterday and two didn't work!! Didn't bother trying the rest out. For this kind of money, EVERY DVD should work. Returning back to Amazon today!"
1,didn't loose any weight,"one of those infomercial products that don't deliver.besides, the videos are very artificial and you can see that they just hired a bunch of actors... not real people."
1,Confused,I placed the order for this product on Saturday. Just received an email notification that the funds will be returned to my bank account with no explanation. At least I got my money back I guess.
1,Book for liberals to hate America even more.,I saw Stephen Marshall of Holy Wars fame and he's totally for that 9/11 mosque. The guy HATES AMERICA! Those who like this type of book will no doubt be pleased with it's writing IMHO.
4,Steering Wheel Cover,My son loved this cover he couldn't wait to go put it on his car on Christmas morning. Very good quality
1,smashed,"Corning ware was so poorly packed that every piece was broken. When I picked up the box it sounded like a huge rattle for a baby. The supplier was not Amazon, and because of that for some reason the item could not be replaced. VERY unsatisfactory purchase. A nuisence overall"
4,Great Book,"This book is great because it assumes you know nothing. It starts from the creation and exisitance of electicity to how batteries , motors and generators are built.It goes over basic DC and AC circuits and even has quizes given to New Naval electricians. The book was last revised in 1969, but for the basics that information hasn't really changed. Its physics after all."
1,sent incorrect item,"i had ordered the ""his"" key holder as i already had the ""hers."" they sent me another ""hers"" although it was (incorrectly) labeled as ""his.""i returned it and decided to not waste any more time with them."
1,Huh-Oh...,"When ""Hunter Moon"" came out - 1st book by these authors - I liked it very much and thought I had made a New Discovery. Then there was ""Moon's Web"". A bit of a deception, but still, it was only their 2nd book, let's give them a chance. With ""Touch of Evil"", they lost me completely. Even though the Thrall and werewolves background is interesting, her characters are not. Katie is not nice, but not in an interesting way if you see what I mean - she comes out mostly as capricious, bitchy and self-centered, and we really wonder why Tom is so hung up on her... As for him, he comes out as a wash-out kind of guy. Blah."
1,mind-numbingly boring,"How can a book containing the word ""werewolf"" be boring, let along this amazingly, mind-numbingly, put-a-pistol-to-my-head boring? I love this genre and really liked the authors prior two Moon books but this is awful."
4,New Series in the Making with a Different Twist to Vampirism,"Katie Reilly is a courier as well as a psychic who has been bitten by a vampire trying to save the life of the man she once loved but who betrayed their love for another. Since Katie still bears the lingering after effects of the bite she can still hear the call of evil.The vampire/Thrall Queen Monica is dying and now they want Katie to be her replacement but Katie wants no part of it as she is not ""Prey"" and Katie is now fighting for her life and the lives of other innocent victims. The battle between good and evil is definitely well traveled road with many twists and turns making ""Touch of Evil"" a pretty different kind of read but one which held my interest until the final page. Katie Reilly is fighter but will she win in the end?""Touch of Evil"" was fantastic and I can't wait to see what happens next in the life of Katie Reilly as she is definitely a force to be reckoned with."
5,I loved it!,"Touch of Evil is an entertaining and griping book. It is fast paced and has plenty of twists and turns to keep your eyes glued to the pages. The unique take on vampires - parasites with a hive mentality - is fresh and intriguing. The characters are interesting and life like. Kate is a fabulous heroine. She can kick ass and take care of herself, and she has many layers to her personality. The world is well-developed and believable.I haven't had the time to do much reading lately, and I am very glad that I picked up Touch of Evil. I enjoyed it immensely and would highly recommend it!"
2,DISAPPOINTED IN PA,"Okay, maybe its me. I love the Sazi books, (Hunter's Moon and Moon's Web), so I thought that I would at least like this one. I just can't seem to warm up to it. I like Vampire books and I like these authors style, but this book just does not cut it for me.There is hope, fellow Sazi book fans, a new Sazi will be out later this year."
3,Psychological pep-talk,"I was somewhat disappointed in this book. The author suggests that it is important for us to become engaged in creative endeavors and to become mindful of the world around us. She is, of course, right. She proposes that instead of describing our style of painting as Abstract or Pop Art or Self-Taught, that a new school of art is needed: ""Unschooled Art"". (Art for the sheer love of creating without any regard to established rules). I love this idea. Overall though, I didn't find much new in this book. The author quotes many famous artists; she notes clinical studies in which she was involved; and she gives us examples of her own creative struggle. But it is overly wordy and it becomes repetitious after a while.If you are lacking in inspiration, I'd highly recommend ""The Art Spirit"" which is a compilation of the teachings of artist Robert Henri."
1,Pointless and disappointing,"The book is not helpful in anyway. She makes statements throughout the book like ""You need to be mindful when painting..."" but she never explains how one becomes mindful or what being mindful truly is. Despite that annoyance, what really got to me is when she would state things such as ""I and this other painter painted the same subject and my painting was clearly superior."" A statement like this is enough for me to put the book down for good, but what makes it worse is that her paintings (she proudly publishes many in the book) are awful. I mean AWFUL!! This look like they were painted by a four-year-old."
3,Too scientific,"While the book is inspirational, there are too many experiments that take away from the real creativity - I mean real psychological and scientific experiments with control groups. Creativity is not about mice and control groups. It's so much more, and I'm afraid that the sheer number of experiments in the book made it a little less than engaging. But when it was good, it was very good - I'm studying pottery at the moment and the book has really freed me from the usual self-criticism. I now look at my ""dodgy"" pieces as works-in-progress and they now just make me laugh. I've also stopped judging my ""talent"". Still, I think that so much more could have been achieved with the subject."
5,Life Changing Mindfulness,"This book opens mindfulness up to art, self expression and multiple applications echoing the research of Theresa Amabile (c.f., Creativity in Context), coping with tobacco cessation (c.f., David & Carole Johnson LIFE CHANGES),and treating OCD patients (e.g. Swartz's The Mind and Brain). We have talents and skills to express, if we can manage to limit negativity and judgmentalness from depreciating our here-and-now moments and by seeing uncertainties as real-life opportunities..."
2,Boring,"I thought this toy was adorable when my sister sent it for my baby boy. He got it at about 6 months old and he liked the colors and played with it often. The older he got the less he played with it. He's 23 months now and hasn't played with it in about a year.IMO it was a waste of money, it didn't have any longevity. Oh well, it was a gift."
3,A little big,"This is a cute toy, but it is a litle heavy and big for her hands she loves the wagon more then the lion."
1,Misleading,"This item shows and describes two knives, but you only get one coarse one. I even got in touch with customer service, described the problem, and they sent me a second order, but it was the same thing. I can only believe this title and description are intentionally misleading."
1,"Keep Your Mouth Closed, Daddy!","This has to be one of the worst songs to come out in 2006. The beat is lame, the flows are weak, and the subject matter is utterly juvenile. The video is just as worse, probably more so since you get to see Nelly and Paul Wall baring their nasty `grillz'. I don't find `grillz' impressive or attractive at all. You're better off putting foil around your teeth. Skip this."
4,Not bad for a first track,"It's better than what we had for Hot Wheels tracks when we were little, that's for sure.The battery operated launcher is fun, but doesn't quite have the power to get the heavier Hot Wheels through the track. Even some of the ones that come with the set (10 were included in our package) don't make it through. It's fun to get a few cars going around the track, and our 3 year old thinks it's hysterical to watch them crash.It's easy enough for him to start up and after a few times he learned the proper way to set the cars up to send them around the track. He has as much fun with it turned off, though.Definitely, this is a ""play with your dad (or mom)"" toy, for at least under 8 or so, since it's not easy to set up, for a little one anyway. For an adult, it's a snap to put together the configurations and it comes apart and goes together easily.We've been having a ton of fun with it, and are very happy with the purchase."
1,Just A Bunch of Quotes,This book is a waste of time. It's just a bunch of quotes - most of them not even bitchey. Save your money.
1,Cheap. But at what price?,"A silent documentary(? )presented as a slide show with old engravings with very short video clips in between. Of course you know by heart who all those famous faces are, cause there's no indication whatsoever. Before you trash it in the closest dumpster around fast forward to the Baryshnikov clip at the very end. It'll pay for the price."
3,Good movie for ballet history,"Though maybe a little ""slow"" in parts for some people I enjoyed watching this ballet. It gave a well-rounded history of ballet. I have watched it several times. It's not one of my favorites because there isn't as much dancing in it, but it was educational."
3,What a pleasent surprise this cd has been.................,"I am in the music business and always buying other people's cds to compare with my projects. What a huge surprise this cd was. I had heard about Jeanne for sometime, but had never bought nor heard her play. She surly has a great touch with the piano keys. Her music is not played at such an advanced level, that the average person can't follow it. I feel like music should be played in such a manner that anyone can understand it, regardless of their musical background.This cd features a lot a great songs. Some of these songs I have wanted to buy recordings of but couldn't find any product with these songs featured on it.The main concern I have for this cd is the song selection. There were a few songs that I didn't personally like. Other than this small issue, I truly liked this cd.I Would Like To Recommend This CD"
4,A True Distinction,"The Hammer of God was Bo Giertz first novel. In a time when many people have a blurred vision of God, Giertz clears the picture with a true distinction between Law and Gospel. Giertz uses three fictional narratives to illustrate the importance of not only proclaiming God's Word, but using it as God intended. Each story deals with a pastor's struggle to be a servant of the Word, and the pitfalls that can happen when God's Word is proclaimed incorrectly. Giertz's characters and situations are crisp and alive, and his writing is brisk and descriptive. I would highly recommend this book to any reader wanting to grow closer to his God."
4,The Hammer of God,This book is an excellent recap of basic Lutheran doctrine and it's roots in the Swedish Church from the 1800's to the middle of the 20th century. It explores the difference between Gospel and Law in a way that is easily understood and contributes to spiritual growth. The only criticism I have is that the book has way too many typos. I'm sure Augsburg is capable of better proofreading.
5,IF EVER A NOVEL COULD TEACH REFORMED THEOLOGY ...,". . . surely this one does. This trilogy, connected more by geography and theological and dramatic intent than characters, is a saga of the pitfalls of heterodoxy when they lead young, newly-trained seminarians astray. Ill-equipped to deal with the spiritual needs of their parishioners, they come to realize they must either cling to the Gospel or fail as shepherds of their flock. Bo Giertz communicates his pastors' and their parishioners' labors and travails with compassion and a keen sense of the twin claims of the Gospel and the Law under the New Covenant of grace."
4,Informative and Enlightening Text,This book wasa one of the more interesting texts in my urban American studies class. Shed some interesting light on common stereotypes and dispelled many of those myths.
3,Not what I expected,"I was looking for books to help with the behavior of my macaw. This book is full of pictures, beautiful pictures. However, I really need help with my bird. Maybe I didn't read the description thoroughly enough."
4,Strong anti-allergen,"Though this stuff is real good in denaturing dander -it leaves a strong smell behind for a day or two that you might be sensitive to. I have an air purifier so it's a non-issue for me. Otherwise, fabulous product!!"
4,Melodic black metal with some refreshing variety,"'Traversing the Awesome Night' is a nice dose of black metal infused with thrash, atmosphere and some strong guitar melodies. There are some slower, moodier parts here, and some nice driving beats that also create a great deal of rhythmic variety.All in all, this is a rock solid release. The production isn't stellar, but does it's part in lending to the overall atmosphere. I would really like to see where these guys go next. It is clear that they have a phenomenal amount of talent, and I think that they will soon outgrow the black metal label and may quite possibly end up covering a lot of musical terrain over the course of their career. Definitely keep an eye out for Primitive Graven Image!"
4,Grinds things!,"Seems a bit bigger than I expected by the picture, it's quite heavy and solid, and doesn't move around much when you're using it. It grinds things evenly. Looks nice and simple. I am not crazy about the shape of the pestle, but it looks like all the other pestles I've seen so I'm not sure if I'm holding it right...Anyway, this thing does the job. And at a great value."
5,Does it's job,"It came quick, packaged nicely, does it's job. It's robust, I dishwash it, I travel with it, and I use it to muddle my mint for mojitos. If that's what your goal is, pick this one."
4,FRAGILE AND CUTE,"IT'S PREATTY, BUT BECAUSE IS SO WIDE IT'S DIFFICULT TO CRUSH THE GARLICS, EVERYTIME I PRESS, THEY FLY ALL OVER. I'M ALSO AFRAID, BECAUSE ITS' MADE OF PORCELAINE, THAT THE MORTAR WILL BRAKE. OH WELL, I WILL TAKE MY CHANCES, THIS CUTE THING WILL STAY AT MY KITCHEN. PERFECT SIZE AND A LOT OF CHARM."
5,Perfect size,"I was concerned that this would be too small; however, it is the perfect size for me. I use it to blend all of my homemade natural haircare products together. This mortar/pestle set ensures that my homemade mixtures are properly blended together, and that I don't mix together too much. It's easy to grip, and dishwasher safe. Great price."
2,Didn't work for me,"I wanted to grind flax seeds, but it didn't work, so I gave it to someone to grind cat food. I don't know if it worked for them."
2,Disappointing!,"I thought this was a fair price for these mushrooms, but was quite disappointed. I soaked the mushrooms, as advised and then added them to a soup.The next trial was in a risotto.The mushrooms lack flavor in general. The stems of these mushrooms are quite inedible; they are very tough and have to be trimmed after soaking. I would not recommend them and wouldn't repurchase."
5,Great mushrooms,"I can't buy these fresh or dried where I live, so I was glad to find these. They are great in soups & casseroles. I've also soaked them in water and used them in omelets. Going to try them in a salad tonight."
3,"good, but....","these are quite tasty and relatively easy to use. they, however, did not come with instructions on rehydrating. finding instructions online is easy enough though."
3,"While sometimes slow, it was often excellent.","I cannot say that I enjoyed A God Against the Gods as much as I did Return to Thebes. Indeed, I came close to giving up at several points in this book. But, when Drury is good, he is very good. At the critical times during this book, such as Akhenaten's founding of Akhetaten's altar. His descriptions are always excellent, and his historical accuracy is unquestionable. I did feel a connection to the characters, although Drury's style made me feel as if I was reading letters that they were sending me. He puts the treader on an equal level with the characters, and does not talk down to the reader. To Jeffrey Li, I must ask, ""If this book was so bad, why did you read the sequel?"""
3,Read the Egyptian,"A well researched book but not nearly as well written as the classic ""The Egyptian"" nor as entertaining as some of the non-fiction books that cover this era. The first book ""Birth of a God"" is a very slow read and very confusing. It took me until the end of that book (or chapter) to realize that each chapter title would tell me the POV of that section."
5,smiley lewis,smiley was the greatest blues voice of all time and this collection tells the whole story
5,Outstanding Scottish Gaelic/Irish Gaelic music,"I have seen excerpts of ""The Highland Sessions"" on YouTube before it was released on DVD, and found it to be amazing in terms of the music itself, the musicians (especially the singers), and the whole production which moves effortlessly between the Scottish performers and the Irish performers. This is a program that will appeal to anyone with an interest in the Gaelic language of either Scotland or Ireland, as well as those with an interest in true Celtic music. The only thing that would make it perfect would be having the lyrics in English, or even in Gaelic, but since that isn't provided, then just listening will take one to a whole new appreciation of the historical links between the two countries. MaryAnn Kennedy deserves great credit for her work on this project."
1,Total disappointment.,"Based on my love of the Transatlantic Sessions, I had high hopes for this video. To my utter astonishment, I found little to like here. The video quality goes from mediocre to horrible. Steve Clooney is dressed like a circus clown and based on his lack of musical contribution, gets way too much screen time . And most of the music is highly repetitive. (Even Mary Black, Karen Matheson and Karan Casey sound monotonous here.) Unless you know and like the music and musicians presented here, you should check them out before investing $33 in this disc."
4,pretty easy to read,i liked this book. the examples were easy to read and the book was a decent introduction to chemistry. if u are required to get this book for an introductory class. dont worry too much its not that hard.
1,terrible shopping at Amazon,I never receive the item I purchased. I wish there is some punishment applied to the cheating sellers.
5,Silent Hunter,"Silent Hunter is good but it's graphics could be better. I like the photo recon, lifeguard duty and, my personal favorite, sub-to-sub combat. I am looking forward to Silent Hunter II. The historical scenarios in Silent Hunter are great. I give this game a 4 star rating."
1,el nino y el lobo,"dissapointed, looks like a VHS tape, a bad quality film!!!the story seems like a religious theme. I was hoping for a DVD not this kind of trash."
2,love the product...however..,"Love this product, but when I opened the package it had exploded all over the box so only about half the bottle was usuable. Will just buy it at a salon next time!"
3,Interesting and old-fashioned,"I found this novel at an estate sale among a huge pile of books. I bought it because I love old books, and one day decided to read it. The writing is definitely in an old-fashioned style, in a sort of Sherlock Holmes way.The story takes place chiefly in the countryside, where the murders of the well-to-do Mr. and Mrs. Langmore become the talk of the town. The daughter, Margaret, is the chief suspect, yet like many of these old books she tends to be a bit of a frail and weak woman, and at one point even falls into hysteria. Enter Detective Adam Adams, from the city, chosen by Margaret's fiance to investigate the murders and to clear her name. Written in an easy style, it was a decent read, and entertaining by how clearly dated it was. Don't expect a thriller, but if you have a bit of time it's worth it."
5,wow,"22 years of military ruck marches and DAMN I wish I had these years ago! I wish they would make military garrison boots but these will do fine for field work. I broke these in on a 12 mile/40lb pack hike in the PNW. I am 6'3"" 240lbs- and they had great ankle support and with double sock/liner combo, I had no rub marks at all. They are a little heavy for shorter hikes and I would recommend the GTX version for those hiking above 70F. Great boot!"
1,There's no listing of the songs,so many other recordings have a listing of the songs on them so that you can make your best choice. I can't pick one if I don't know what's on it!
1,"""See How She Runs"" Video","I have done consider shopping on Amazon and have been very happy with my purchases thus far with one exception. I have to say that the quality of a very recently purchased video, ""See How She Runs"", was of the poorest qualty and expensive to boot. Infact, I do believe that the seller taped the movie off of television and slapped on a label and called it new. It was so terrible that after watching but a few minutes of it, I removed it from the VCR and pitched it! I would never purchase from this seller ever again!"
3,"Ok, but why can't the water tanks stand up?","I have this and the only thing I don't like about it is that the tops of the water tanks are angled so I can't stand them up in the sink easily when I am filling them. When it's full, it takes one hand to hold the tank steady, one hand to hold on to the bacteria treatment bottle, and one hand to unscrew the cap of the bacteria treatment bottle. How many hands is that? I could see some designer saying ""Wouldn't it be pretty if the tops of the water tanks were angled?"" but at some point in the process someone should have figured out that the tanks would be a lot easier to fill if the tops were flat. Filling them with water is an awkward ten minute process and it shouldn't be that way. That's the only negative but it's a pretty big one."
2,Wouldn't buy this again,"This humidifier was a little ""pricey"" but I had owned one from this company before, so I purchased this one. The water tanks become very heavy to manage upside down, (while you fill them) and they don't seem as sturdy as they should be. The air wick was hard to clean and didn't hold up to more that a couple of cleanings."
3,"Good, but not one of Roger's best","This book was very enjoyable, the only thing I didn't like was the abrupt ending. It left me feeling unfullfilled. After the way Eve carried on about her exboyfriend throughout most of the book, you would like the ending to really summarize her current realtionship with Brant. I just felt like the storyline was less about her relationship with him than with her ex. I did like the way Rosemary Roger's gave you the background information on the characters which helped you to understand why they acted the way they did. Over all, it was worth the time to read but I would recommend The Crowd Pleasers or Love Play if you want to read a modern novel by this author."
2,OMGWTFBBQ!!!!!,"This was a puzzling book. Lots of characters, lots of sex, lots of group sex, some rape, weird incestuous vibes and a happy ever after with a cherry on top ending. I give this two stars because of the many memorable WTF scenes that still linger in my head a few days after finishing the book. I wish the author had expanded more on the end of the book when things are supposed to be working out because she did a thorough job showing how messed up the characters were and how they had so many issues and problems. But then it all works out and I'm still not sure why. It was way too quick. Still this is one of the more memorable WTF romances I've read."
2,Eve Mason is an idiot,"I recently re-read this book; boy, have times changed! Although he may have been considered a hero at one time, Brant Newcomb is nothing more than a child molester, drug dealer, and rapist, and Eve is little more than a whore. I can understand why her boring boyfriend, David, found it hard to believe she had been raped--she slept with practically everyone she knew. Most of the women behaved as if they were victims of circumstance, with no will of their own. I didn't care what happened to any of the characters, except David's poor little sister, Lisa."
4,Pretty good..,"I read this book when I was younger and just recently read it again. I found I liked the book and the way it explored the lives of all the secondary characters. The only problem I had was that the heroine, Eve, was obsessed with one of the men in the book, making you say ""ENOUGH ALREADY""! I also would have liked more interactive scenes with the hero and the heroine toward the end of the book. But, all in all, a good book. It proves anyone can find love no matter what there past!"
2,Social Science,"Number of occurences of female names in the chapter, ""Life Choices for Women and Men:"" 61Number of occurences of male names in the chapter, ""Life Choices for Women AND MEN:"" 8 (mostly academics)"
1,Unstable media,"Memorex used to have a fine, stable product that was reliable. However, the undisclosed change in manufacturers from Infodisc Technology to Indian made Moser Baer India Ltd. has yielded a product that I will no longer use. The newer media has an impossibly high failure rate. In a recent pack of 25, only 2 were readable. I for one will no longer purchase Memorex DVD+RW media."
1,Poor discs,"I purchased these discs a long time ago but just gotten around to writing the review. These discs were a great bargain ($), but when I was trying to record, there were so many issues with it I ended up using them as cup holders. Whenever I tired to record on them, some error would happen and/or would not read/write. Then I research on it and found that the quality was poor and many others were having issues with them. I ended up getting a spindle of Sony and they worked great! No issues with Sony. So I would recommend that you stay away from Memorex DVD+RW from my experience."
1,Memorex sells bad discs,"I have purchased many single pack DVD+RW of the Memorex brand. So far I haven't gotten any of them to work. I spend 2 hours trying to format them only to get an error message at the end. I was able to write to them at first, but never able to read them again. Other DVD+RW brands work, so I know it's not my drive."
2,Be careful....,"I own the Gateway AR-230 DVD recorder. I purchased this 25 pack of Memorex DVD+RW's thinking it was a great bargain......too bad it wasn't. The first one I used worked fine, but this only set me up to record something using my timer only to come home and find that the DVD had a write error. The recording was lost, and so was the DVD as it wouldn't read even as it tried to format. I figured it was a one time thing, but the next two Memorex DVD+RW's I tried both failed as well. One would stop after recording for 30 seconds after formatting, and the other couldn't even be read. Then, of course, I thought something was wrong with my DVD recorder, but my Verbatim DVD+RW's work great. If only they were the same price! : ).....anyway, make sure these suckers work with your deck before spending your hard earned $$."
1,"Frist it was good, then it was bad.","I bought some Memorex Dvd+rws a few months ago and they worked great. I used them in my Go video R6640 to recored stuff off my tivo,and I did not have a bad one in the bunch. I was starting to run low so I got a new 25 pack (paid $30). These new ones looked a little diffrent, the spindle had a gold wrapper, but they were still memorex Dvd+rws, they worked well before so why not buy them again. Boy was that a mistake the new ones did'nt work well at all, I went thru 5 of them trying to get them to work, nothing would record on them. I thought It was my recorder at first then I used one of the old disks to record and it worked fine. I don't know what memorex did but I won't be buying them again. I see the new ones are made in Taiwan, I don't know where the old ones were made. Now I'll see if can get a refund from Best Buy or a least an exchange."
5,Very pleased!,"I own a Philips DVDR-75 Recorder for over a year now. The ONLY discs I've used in this machine are the Memorex 2.4X DVD+RW discs. They have worked flawlessly. In over 175 DVD+RW discs burned on this machine I have only encountered 1 Disc to be defective. In the beginning portion (center) of the disc there is a slight factory blemish which causes an ""error"" in recording during the beginning of the disc. After this area the disc is perfect however. I continue to purchase these discs for all of my recording needs. I highly recommend these discs to anyone. They're my only choice so far. 175+ with only 1 defective...not bad by any standard."
2,Unreliable!,"Bought these for recording on my Sony DVD Recorder. First problem encountered: does not record from timer set programs. Second frustrating problem: I will frequently record from TiVo programs onto these discs, then try to play them back and come up with the same disc error problems (""disc error, unreadable, or disc dirty). Some of the discs work without a hitch, then the next few will be completely unusable! I will not buy these Memorex discs again and recommend you do not waste your money on them either."
5,works as intended,great replacement part. installed perfectly and very quickly with a screwdriver. does everything its supposed to do. was shipped fast and packaged well
4,Fantastic upbeat and positive music!,"The only song of Bosson's I knew was ""We Live"" and I took a chance buying the CD (for a price I would normally never pay). It was worth every penny. This is an incredibly fun, positive, upbeat CD by a talented artist. I highly recommend this singer. You'll never have the blues listening to him!"
5,Wonderful Weight Lifting Book,It arrived fast. The books give a good explanation and detail on what muscles you are working out as you do specific ones. Great!
5,Strength,My brother is a weight lifter (enters constants) and I gave him this book for his birthday. He had never seen a book like this and thought it was an excellent book representing and diagraming all the muscles along with what exercises work each muscle. I am a runner and have recent added weight lifting to my training program- so I bought a book for myself. Excellent book for beginners like me and long time weight lifters.
2,Lacking scientific support,"After reading many books of this kind and looking specifically for books with a strong scientific support, I can say that this is a wonderful book in terms of images and editing, but not a good reference if one is looking for the best exercises and methodologies. Scientific evidence proves that the exercises described here are not the best choice, some of them might even be dangerous if one is not careful enough, and moreover, the muscolar districts involved in the exercise are not those that are highlighted."
2,simple minded and full of inaccuracies,"The information provided in this book is not rigorously based on in-depth knowledge of human anatomy and exercise kinesiology. For example, the Bridging exercise is shown in this book to exercise only th buttock muscle. Anyone who has done this exercise will know that it works the lower back just as much if not more. It seems that the author simply assumed what is going on without much studies. The only value of this book is all the drawings. It may help some people understand their muscle better and can be used as a simple reference but should not be taken seriously. It is not really worth buying for people who just want to learn how to exercise. It doesn't really give you ideas on how to plan your workout."
5,A must have.,"A must have for bodybuilders or students of musculo-skeletal anatomy. It is concise, well-illustrated, and great for helping determine which exercises involve a given set of muscles."
5,Strength Training Anatomy,"Excellent book, very clear pictures of muscles and bones and specific exercises to work specific muscle groups which are clearly hightlighted and labeled. There are explanations of the name of the muscles worked and the exercises. Very well organized chapters by muscle groups."
5,Excellent Muscle Graphics,I was referred to this book because it is used by many physiology/exercise/health students at my university. Am glad I bought it. The muscle graphics are excellently done. It is very clear which muscles are being worked by the various exercises. What I like most about the book is it presents a few exercises for each muscle group versus some books that present 50 exercises for each muscle group. Having so many excercises can be overwhelming to those new to working out. This is an well written and presented book for body building.
5,Strenght Training Anatomy,Good book gives a great overview of what workouts target specific body parts and how to do them.
5,"simple, easy to understand.",I love tis book is very simple to understand and to execute. The only down side of it is that it would had been much better is it had examples on reps and set to do for either cut or grow muscle. Overall great item.
4,Le Book is good,Wonderfully illustrated book makes it easy to understand which exercises are right for each muscle group. Very educational and also useful as a motivational tool. Only problem its published and printed in France (written in English). Viva La Freedom Fries!
4,A good book,"Very nice book, with a lot of excersises that are availible in most fitnessrooms and group excersise classes. For all this excersises it is shown which muscles are used and how to do it correctly. Also some variations are shown if these are possible."
4,Strength training anatomy,This book helped me to remember what I learned in school several years ago and made it easy. It was similar to Body Worlds as in looking at positional holds and better than dealing with a dried out animal.
3,Somewhat lacking,"This book was recommended as a good supplement to anyone starting out or getting certified in the field of personal training. I found it to be eductaional for basic large muscle groups and which are used in a given resistance exercise. But it is lacking in other important areas, like identifying assistor muscle groups, or just a general breakdown of large muscle into their smaller components. Also, kinesiology seems to be completely absent. ""Anatomy for Strength and Fitness Training"" by Marc Vella is a much better practical choice for anyone entering upon the fitness field."
4,Great reference tool,"When I get asked about what certain lifting exercises to do, this book is a great reference tool. When you are preparing a lifting program, this book is really helpful in determining the types of muscle groups that you are wanting to do.If you want to work on your triceps, all you need to do is look in the back of the book at the chart of the human body. The triceps are identified by a certain color. Then, you flip through the book and look for the corresponding colors that identify triceps exercises.If you are just starting out, I would highly recommend this book in developing your workout routines. If you are experienced, a little more information has never hurt anyone."
5,Great book with very detailed pictures,"I have been working out for 5 years on and off. I bought this book to isolate certain muscle groups and it has paid off. Not only does the book show you how to properly do specific exercises, it warns of potential dangers of some exercises. The images in the book are very detailed and there are a ton of exercises that are explained in detail. A+"
5,Awesome book,This book is simple to understand and the illustartions are great. I highly recommend this book to anyone.
2,Helpful for understanding science not body building,"This book just details the muscles that get engaged when performing an exercise. It doesn't really talk about how many times we should workout in a week, what to eat, how to combine exercise etc...all that is in the book is just the exercises and a small explanation on the muscles that is engaged while performing the workout.I would not recommend this to people trying to develop their body and needing a guide."
1,The Wildest?,"I don't need all this. All I really want is vol. 1, which was originally titled ""The Wildest"". Why won't these lunkheads reissue this recording, his best? Arrrggghhh!"
5,Utterly Brilliant,"A fantastic CD from a guy with an incredible writing talent and an amazing voice. I expected a first-class album and as usual with Edwin Yearwood, I wasn't disappointed in the slightest.There is a good mix of old and new material, something for everyone, so people who follow soca music will know the krosfyah tunes like Pump Me Up, Wet Me and Something Greater. For those who are not faimilar with soca, once you listen to this CD you will not be able to sit still!This is a must buy, you will not regret it and it will also help get Edwin and krosfyah out there in the public eye where they rightfully belong."
5,The Greatest!!!,I really love this book.It is very easy to understand and has everything a person needs to know about WinXp. If you are serious about getting into Windows Xp and learning bumper to bumper..this is THE BOOK FOR YOU!
2,A little book that offers little,"Wasn't sure what I expected in a pocket sized book, but really the book tries to cram too much info in its pages. Consequently, the information on composers is barely useful, even though the number of composers is volumnious, which leaves too few pages for the other topics it tries to cover. The weak section on composers is larger than the section on musical terms.Nice idea, but ho-hum result."
5,Essential Dictionary of Musical Notation,A comprehensive and well laid out reference book. A quick and concise aid for writing and teaching music.
4,very useful overview,"I give copies of this brief dictionary to my graduating (high school) Band seniors. It is quite comprehensive in terms of subject matter covered, even if most stuff is covered superficially. A nice basic reference for high school sudents."
4,Great for what it is!,"Don't expect an exhaustive dictionary of theory and history here. But as a pocket-sized quick resource for history, orchestration, or score reading, this is a handy tool. As a composer and conductor, I recommend it as an on-the-go resource."
2,looks nicer on picture,These shoes look better on the screen than in person. Most of the white is shiny and my son wasn't too impressed with them. That's the only problem (besides sizing) when you purchase online - - you're stuck with them whether they like them or not!
4,Factory Seconds? poor QC?,"Ceramic instead of bakelite or other high-temp polymer, but it had a crack along its left back corner. The piece did not break completely off, yet, but you KNOW it is weaker than it should be, and it might not last ""forever""._I_ would have put this product into the ""factory seconds"" bin, if I had assembled it at their factory.I don't mind buying factory seconds, usually, but the seller should tell the buyer: ""That's why mine are cheap."""
4,Someone put this disc back in print!!!!,"Smoking Popes launced their career w/ ""Get Fired,"" an album that showcases the vocals of Mr. Josh Caterer. Heartfelt love tunes a la Emo/Pop-Punk genre. Unfortunately, this album is currently out o' print - Someone needs to give it life once again, pleeeease!!"
5,Country Roads,We absolutely loved it. My husband and I just sat around while it was playing and sang along as well as discussed the history that came along with each song.
3,Country Roads CS,I only liked the 1st and 4th CD's. They were good.The 2nd and 3rd were not popular country songs that I really was not familiar with.
3,Need to know where to start? This is a good place...,"I am just beginning to plan and seek resources for my nonprofit. I started out with this resource and I was satisfied with the comprehensive data it presented on beginning a nonprofit - but in a general ""forest-not-the-trees"" sort of way. I was introduced to the immense task that starting a nonprofit can be, but I would recommend using this book with more detailed resources. One great thing about the book is the end of the book is dedicated to state requirements & contact addresses/numbers. Again, this book is quite general and it surely isn't everything you need to know, but it is a good starting guide on getting familiar with what is to come."
3,Fruitwood?,Very good stain top of the Gel's But somewhere in the not so distant past they changed the color I had fruitwood in the same brand and it is a total different color???
3,The Tempest (with Helen Mirren),"Disappointing, despite a potentially great cast. As a feminist and as an ardent admirer of Helen Mirren - did anybody see her Phèdre from the National Theatre of London? - shattering!), I regret to say that for me, Prospera instead of Prospero just didn't come off. She came across as a strong-willed mother, but she lacked the towering stature of the magician who engineers a tempest to serve his ends, involving far more than just her daughter's fate.Sorry."
5,shakespeare at his modern best,"well filmed, well spoken, well interpreted....it is hard to imagine a more accessible re-telling of the tempest for a modern audience. the rhythm of the film left me feeling a groundling at the globe...the actors stepped into my living room and told a brilliant story of treachery, revenge and forgiveness. taymor is a genius."
3,The Tempest?,Expected more with Mirren in the title role.Not a bad perfomance overall.Makeup and special effects were very good.
1,Why....please.......why?,My only complaint about this is the length.....why is the blue ray 89 min and the regular version 20 minutes longer. This makes absolutely no flipping sense to me. I desperately want to see this movie. But I am not going to pay for an 89 minute blue ray.
2,Only Shakespeare Enthusiasts Will Enjoy This,"I saw this film in Hollywood only because Helen Mirren was doing a Q/A after the film. I will pay to see any film she's in and looked foward to this one. My mistake was that I knew nothing about The Tempest, and for that matter very little about Shakespeare, so I missed a lot of the gags. Anyone who is in the same boat of me will not appreciate this film. I'd highly suggest reading the play before seeing the movie. The people around me who obviously were more familiar with the play seemed to enjoy the show. What I remember most about this movie were the bizarre trippy dreamlike scenes."
1,Avoid This Stinker,"Bad. Truly awful. Miscast. Horrible and distracting music. Plenty of overacting. Difficult to understand dialog, not because it is Shakespeare but because of the noise that makes it hard to hear and some bad enunciation. Special effects that aren't that special. It is just one colossal mess."
1,Way too pacific,"I was interested in this on the strength of ""Titus"". Unfortunately, this is probably the dullest and least imaginative ""Tempest"" I've ever seen. Taymor turned Prospero into ""Prospera"", found a nice location, added a few early Disney era ""special"" effects, and seemed to think that this should somehow merit attention. It doesn't."
5,Brilliant! Best Tempest EVER!,"This film took a long time to be released on DVD, but it was well worth the wait. Julie Taymor is is a true visionary. Her interpretation of The Tempest brings both the beautiful and unexpected to Shakespeare's masterpiece. I've never seen a completely satisfying production of this play on film or video. Despite the efforts of fine actors and directors who've attempted it, the visual aspect of past productions could never match Shakespeare's exquisite language. Julie Taymor's completely individual VISCERAL sense of design and movement, as well as Elliot Goldenthal's musical score, are genius. They illuminate Shakespeare's text and the masterful performances of the cast with true insight and magical delight. Not to be missed. The Tempest and Taymor's earlier film of Titus are far and above my favorite interpretations of the Bard's work. I really look up to Julie Taymor as one of the finest artists of our time."
3,Middle Class White Kids Go Bad,The book held my attention but I felt like one of the bored jurors (like the authour referenced on several occassions during some key testimony)close to the end when reading about the trial.The ending was a disappointment (when you read about the sentences of these kids) which should have been expanded upon. The author then hits you with some moralistic point of view which left me feeling less angry at the families and more at him. I felt manipulated.
3,I didn't feel that this book was sincere...,"I agree with one of the other commentors who wondered how the author knew Bobby's thoughts moments before his death. I didn't feel like he REALLY knew the story. He just wanted to write a novel. He made it all seem so phony and I was a little disapointed. I would reccommend it highly if it were a work of fiction, but not to someone who reads true crime for the same reasons I do."
2,"Shocking true story, but writing very sloppy.","The subject of this book is a shocking true crime story. (Soon to be a major motion picture, blah, blah, blah.) But Schutze treatment of it is sloppy, contradictory, and very weak. I would swear Schutze is a C-average high school student who loves true crime magazines, but I can't prove it. (Nor do I care.) Catch the A&E documentary for a more accurate, detailed account."
4,"Hard to call excellent or ""the bomb.""","I have read many true crime books in the past 15 years, never have I put one down and said ""Wow, what a good book."" I read them because I am interested and fascinated by the way people rationalize and justify things. I have never called a true crime book ""excellent"", mostly because someone had to suffer immense pain, and eventually die to have a book written about them. I found this book interesting, fascinating, and hard to put down. If you are a true crime reader, this may be one for your list. If you are a bully, you may want to read this book to find out what your fate may be."
1,Sloppily Written,"I found editorial mistakes (referring to Bobby when they should have referred to Marty for one) and I found that the writer's attempts to mimic how the teens spoke to each other clumsy and stilted. Interesting story but I found it to be sloppily written when compared to true crime writers who are masters of the genre, such as Ann Rule."
4,Provides more essential details than the movie,"I bought the book after seeing the movie. Immediately I was struck by how much the dialogue in Larry Clark's film followed the text of the book.At the same time, the book provides much more detail about the background of the culprits in the incident than was seen in the movie. I found it interesting to read that Lisa was an unattractive, chubby teenage girl. Yet in the movie she is portrayed as an attractive vixen. The paradox was not lost on me, as once I read about her true personality, I was able to comprehend her motives better, and to see how Lisa's insecurities led to her obsession with Marty."
3,"Yes, someone may !","Bobby Kent was a bully, a rapist, and a drug addict. While you can not condone what his murderers did, I did not at any moment during this book feel sorry for Bobby, despite Shutze's attempts to make him look like the main victim here. Shutze's ""bad seed"" theory is laughable. He did not speak to any of the murderers or their families, yet he is able to know what they were thinking and feeling while killing Kent. This is a good book that cover most facts about the case, but you need to get past Shutze's lengthy theories and make your own mind."
1,Trash,I get the sense the book was taken from court transcripts and it seems very fictional. I threw it away after a few pages.
1,This book should be called Fiction,"The book had to many inconsistency between real-life and what the author thought happened! Made up? This book is borderline fiction. Good story, but part fiction."
2,True Story? I think not!,This book is by no means a true story! It is totally fabricated and full of lie after lie after lie. The way Jim Shutze objectifies these troubled teens as sex crazed spoiled brat murdering monsters is absurd. I think Jim Shutze is a pedophile who got his rocks off while writing a fabricated pornographic novel about a serious and sad chain events that led to death of a monster. Check out Acceptable Sacrifice: Based on a True Story of Abuse and Murder if you want to hear the real story written by a friend of The main charecter. This book is a better read and more of a true story than this piece of crap smut book will ever be!
2,Is this fiction or nonfiction?,"I think I would've liked the book better if the author had said that it was ""based on actual events"". It read too much like a novel. While I have no problem with an author using creative license at times, some of the dialogue was too far fetched. I also found it impossible that he would know what the characters (for lack of a better term) were thinking, especially the target. There were at least two inconsistencies that I found. Not good. Makes you doubt the veracity of this version of the story. As a novel this would've worked."
5,really cool,"this is a good book for anyone especially teenagers. It's got the works: violence, prostitution, troubled families, sex..you name it. super good. And the weirdest thing is it's all completly true."
1,The ultimate white trash book,"I literally threw the book away after 25 pages. The story could be recounted in a different way, but the author presents the story in almost an ""I was there"" approach which makes you feel like you're reading white trash writing about white trash. The foul language used by the author was totally unnecessary and didn't help the story in any way. I guess I was the only one who was reading the story to understand the psychology of the people involved, rather than read a shock-crime book."
4,Lost children,"Bully, was extremely confusing to me. I found all these teenages with nothing to do but contemplate murder. What a sad commentary for the American youth. What happen to getting a job, or involve oneself in sports, or reading a book. I wonder what was/is the rate of STD's, HIV, and Hepatatis in Broward county or any other American county for that matter. Where are the parents of these children? There is a tremendous lack in the US of parental guidance and if it does exist, its misdirected (one parent households). When my friends and I were growing up in the 60's, we participated in sports,got involved in school activities, and held down part time jobs and as a result became doctors,lawyers, engineers, etc."
4,A Good Book,"This book really makes you think. It is so great. I can see the story from both sides of the spectrum. Although I truly believe that no one no matter what ever deserves to be killed, but in that same respect no one no matter what deserves to be treated the way Bobby Kent treated those people. I do believe that they should have went to the police, especially the girls who he raped. I do feel bad for these kids almost, they had no parental supervision, no goals, no ambition they were basically floating around with no where to really go. You can see in the end of the book how the parents blame everyone but there kids for what happened, maybe because they relized that if they really sat and looked at the situation, they themselves were also to blame for the death of Bobby Kent."
2,not as good as the dustcover says,"The dustcover promises a very sensational story, but little in this was, in fact, more than pathetic. i was troubled by the fact that the author describes the main characters' thoughts and feelings in great detail, but there is no evidence that he ever spoke with any of them. looking at the pictures, i was struck that they all appeared to be either police or newspaper photos. this lack of personal photographs made me wonder if any of the principals or their families had cooperated with the author at all. if they didn't, this book falls closer to novelization than to reportage."
3,Is This Really The Truth ?,"This Is A True Story.... Thats what the first page Of Bully.. Does Anyone Deserve To Die says. Shouldn't it be This Is BASED On A True Story ? This is just Jim Shutze's version of the Truth and The events leading up to the murder of Bobby Kent. I was a bit dissapointed with this interpertation of facts that Shutze claims to be the real story of Bullying,Torture, Rape and Homicide. I believe that this is only one verison of what really happened. I seem to get the notion that whoever told Jim Shutze this tale that they were being unfair to some of the central charecters that fill this unnerving story. If you are going to claim that this is the whole truth , shouldn't you write all the charecter's verions of the story and not just what you believe to be the True Story?"
4,Absolutely Horrifying,"I actually read this about a year ago and have since passed the book along to several friends(the book is so good I've yet to get it back). Bully is a real teen tragedy. The boys involved in the crime had it all, came from good homes, had nice cars, clothes & anything else they could want. The girls had it kind of tough and went looking for trouble, hanging at the mall tends to get boring pretty fast. Marty gets fed up with Bobby Kent's constant teasing and tormenting and decides to get even, recruiting Lisa & the rest of their friends. They thought they had it all figured out, collecting all kinds of weapons to use after they lured him to the beach. The crime itself is very disturbing and makes you realize how sick these kids were. A great, fast read."
1,HORRIBLE,This book was horrible as was the movie it was disgusting and POORLY depicts the kids of the area as sex addicted drug addicts. I live in the area where this happened and actually went to the set while they were filming the movie and watched a little of it but when i finally saw the movie i was disgusted in the opening scene the girls are seen half naked walking into a supermarket a winn dixie which is around the corner from my house in the embassy lakes shopping center i live in embassy lakes its HORRIBLE and i was sick just watching it depict us a little more humanly and not stupidly...
5,Miss Zukas does it again!,"Helma Zukas is summoned to the home of her best friend, Ruth, in order to inspect a dead body which has been found in a periwinkle patch. At the same time, her co-workers at the library are trying to persuade Helma to do the canoe section of a relay race which attracts over 200 teams. Intrepid woman that she is, Helma manages to do both, with her usual careful preparation and fine eye for detail. This is a delightful series and this particular book is one of the best of the Miss Zukas series. Dereske's characters are likeable and humorous and she does a great job of describing the area in Washington state where the series takes place. She also manages to tie up all of the loose ends from the murder and gives the ending a bittersweet tinge."
4,Good Beach Reading,"Straight-laced librarian Miss Zukas is a bit of a dark horse. In addition to being a prim and proper librarian, she has a history as a canoeist. But her efforts to train for the big race and help the library's team beat the city planning department are interrupted. A dead man is found outside Miss Zukas's friend's house, and said friend Ruth becomes the prime suspect in the subsequent investigation. In her efforts to clear Ruth Miss Zukas finds herself in danger.This is by all accounts an entertaining, quick read. Miss Zukas is starting to look a bit more human by this third book in the series. It's still not clear to me why all men in the general vicinity seem to have a crush on Helma Zukas- perhaps it's the stuffy/sexy librarian trope? Still, I suspect I'll be reading more in the series. These are fun books."
3,Works all right.,"This comb works all right. I like the spacing of the tines, and the handle is comfortable. As to its anti-static properties, I can't say I was impressed. We were having a very cold snap, so we were running the heat a lot and the whole house was filled with static. We were getting shocked whenever we touched each other or anything for that matter, and our hair was standing out when we would comb it, etc. I was hoping this would help when combing my long haired Persian, so his coat would lay flat but it didn't make any difference. I even used it with an anti-static spray-on coat conditioner, but no change. Still, all in all, a decent pet comb with a good handle."
4,Elite Commander Wrist Support,"Pros. This gloves looks really cool. Black and professional. When I was wearing it, every1 automatically thought I was a pro. Good way to practice with.Cons. For some reason my scores were lower when I had this. Some people use gloves some don't. This is a good tool to use when your practicing; I'm not sure I would use it to for tournaments though (unless I want to look cool in it). The reason why I give it a 4/5 is it doesn't protect one the part of the hand thats important, your NUCKLES. I rather just have tape in my knucles and not use the glove sometime.CONCLUSION: If your going to get a glove, this one is the real deal. But don't rely on gloves when it comes to tournament. Even pros don't use glove. Looks for this glove is 5/5 though!"
3,"The StrongArm 4955 Works, But....","A few years ago, I replaced the original lift supports, that I purchased at a national brand auto parts store, on my 1994 Toyota Celica. They only lasted about 2 years, max. Even though I do not know what brand they were, they bore the same model number ""4955"", and they appeared to be identical to the StrongArm brand that I just purchased from Amazon. The new StrongArm lift supports did fit, and they do function, but they also lack the center pin that the original Toyota brand had between the bolts, which faciltates installation. Without the pin, there is an empty hole in the frame which should be filled with something to prevent leaks in the hatchback/trunk."
2,Save Your Money!!!,"After Papas Fritas' ""Buidings and Grounds"" CD proved to be one of the best 'happy pop' CD's of the year, I was thrilled to get this new release. Sure, it only has 9 new tracks, but I figured they had to be worth the price. Wrong! Maybe 2 of the new tracks are really satisfying, the rest sound like leftovers that weren't good enough to make it onto earlier albums. This CD is just a mish-mash of good and not-so-good tracks from other Papas releases, with some mediocre unreleased tracks (including an extremely lame cover of Fleetwood Mac's ""Book of Love"") thrown in. Definitely not a labor of love!So if you don't know the band, buy their 2000 release ""Buidings and Grounds."" And then do yourself a favor and buy Komeda's ""What Makes It Go."" And The Sugarplastic's ""Bang! The Earth is Round."" And Jon Brion's ""Meaningless."" Then you'll really be happy."
5,Very nice coffee table book,"Very nice coffee table book, with a nice variety of clowns, some scary, some funny, all enjoyable to look at."
1,"You're kidding me, right?","This is scary stuff and should be kept out of the hands of innocents. It is corruptive, corrosive and full of ""CLOWN PAINTINGS"", people. Clowns I tell you, clowns!Need I say more?I'm off in my jalopy now, away and away and away from those dastardly, red-nosed purveyors of horror.L.A.E."
1,Do not purchase!,"Do not purchase this product from this store. I attmepted to purchase the green version. Like other reviewers, I recieved the cheaper, MOBY tyke light WITHOUT the Rechargeable Base. I chose this light because I did not want to have an exposed charging cord. The product I recieved has a much greater potential danger to your child. This item is misrepresented by the seller!!"
4,great nightlight!,"we bought this to put in the baby's room so there would be light for night time feedings and diaper changes. it is perfect! in fact, i have bought more to use in other rooms and give as gifts!"
4,"Great night light, good for feeding time too!",Got this for my sister when she 1st had her baby. My sister really likes it and says that the brightness level was just right for feeding in the middle of the night :)
2,Disappointing!,"I probably didn't read the description carefully enough, but I was expecting an all music DVD and not a documentary. I became bored halfway through the first DVD and turned it off. I haven't played the CD yet."
1,OUCH,"I bought these shoes two weeks ago and they broke on me the first night I wore them. I don't know if it was a defect but I had to return them. The sales clerk also told me that everyone who bought the shoe had to return them as well. Don't get me wrong I really loved them, but whose idea was it to put rubber in between two pieces of wood."
4,If you gota have AUTOCAD this ain't bad,"If you must use autocad (which I am not a big fan of but it is industry standard) Autocad LT is a cost effective solution. The product shipped as stated and the pricing was competive. Training videos would be a helpful conpanion product, due to the sleep inducing method in which the manuel and help sections are written."
1,Not as advertised student version,"This product when it arrived turned out to be Autocad LT Student version, Which can not. legally, be used for commercial purposes. It was returned immediatly and the refund was not made for almost three weeks."
4,Professional AutoCAD Software!,"I've been using AutoCAD 2D design software for 10 years. This 2008 version is the best and most useful one yet. I use it to document my machine element designs, and my assembly designs. I simply copy each feature in the proper view into my assembly drawings. The new labeling feature that automatically adjusts to the viewport scale is awesome. With earlier versions I had difficulty opening a detail drawing and seeing the font and dimension sizes have changed! This 2008 version works superbly with MS Vista Ultimate! All the former versions are incompatible with Vista. I recommend it to anyone who needs a world-class mechanical or electrical design program, but does not need to spend 5 times as much for 3-D capability."
3,Price vs. Value,"AutoCAD LT 2008 was easy to install and is loaded with features. Too bad we most likely will never use most of them. Pros: It's interface is familiar, it's the industry standard, and works pretty much as is expected. There don't seem to be as many bugs as I experienced in older versions. Cons: Pricey, but everybody knows that, and we're stuck because AutoDesk has the industry in a strangle hold. I don't like how small the tool palettes are when my monitor is in a higher resolution. The printing interface is awkward."
4,nice upgrades,"I have been using AutoCAD LT 2003 and like the updates in the new version. Although it takes some getting used to, some of the changes are intuitive. The older versions did not automatically go into edit commands like 2008 does. Just click on an object and the attributes highlight and can be changed without typing in the command. That is just some of the changes that make this a really nice upgrade from earlier versions."
1,Not original recordings,Do not buy this CD if you want the original versions of the songs listed. 'All selections are new stereo recordings...' reads the fine print on the back of the CD. Do not make the same online mistake that I made!
2,A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT:,"After ""The World as I Found It,"" this novel just left me bored. The character development is good but labored. I found the endless descriptions and musings of a young man whose mother has died simply tiresome. I could not finish the book"
1,NEED PATIENCE / REPETITIVE,"The menu is crap. you can not play continuously. Have to go wait and thn go back to menu and choose your way into the game over and over again after each single question. is not practical. we tried all kind of games within but all are the same. need a skip button and shortcuts.you should have a lot of patience to play this gameAlso, I guess they could not buy many licenses , as the questions are mostly made up of the same actors/movies."
3,Not a good game but not a bad game,"Just as it says this is neither a good game not a bad game. It can seem fun if it is your first DBZ game but bad if this is not the first. If you've played the first 2 games then you'll notice that theres not much different than the the 3. The main difference is the adding of a few characters which you may never play as anyway (freiza's henchmen?) which means once you've unlocked all characters you may never play this game but a couple times then after that its prolly gonna collect dust. However if you've never played the first 2 tenkaichi games then give this a shot-you may just like it. However if you played the first 2, then I recommend just renting first before buying."
5,DBZ BT3 Review,I got this for my 14 year old son because Dragon Ball Z is his favorite show and he absolutely loved it. He said the gameplay and the character selection was amazing. He said he recommends it to any Dragon Ball Z fan.
4,Pretty Good,"I've never owned any of the other dragonball z games, so I can't really tell you if this one is better or worse.The game is very fun to play, and the reason I bought it was to play as all the characters. There are so many! The game however only kept my attention for a couple of weeks at most until I kind of forgot about it. If you're going to buy this game, I suggest buying it used for a cheaper price. While it's fun and all, I think there could have been more, the fights start to become a little repetitive after awhile. It's fun to experience the world of dbz though.4/5."
4,Best DBZ Game Ever. Enough Said.,"This Game ROCKS!!! There are so many new battle moves its like a totally differant game the tenkaichi 2. This game's only weak point is its story mode.the battles that are in the story mode are all amazing, but the could be more of them."
2,Wonderful but,"This could have been my best ps2. It has game tight controls, fast action packed fighting,and items with actual effects on the characters abilities. But the thing that ruined it for me is those loading screens take around 5-8 minutes to load or would frequently just freeze. Due to this the battle against garlic.jr freezes every-time he powers up.Conclusion: when it does work this game is a blast ,but frequently freezes too much to be enjoyable. I hope this product review will help my seller."
3,These are ok at best....,These are not as good as I expected. It's actually difficult to grab the smaller fine hairs with these.... I've also found that they often break the hair off instead of just gripping it. I just don't think these are ideal for plucking eyebrows (which is what I bought them for).I've put them in the first aid kit on my boat as I think they'll do a decent job at removing any splinters.
1,Not like the picture- mine was colorless (plain stainless steel),"I haven't used the tweezer yet but right out of the package I'm disappointed. Not only is it not red, it isn't any ""assorted color"" at all. Of all the tweezerman tweezers offered on Amazon I chose this one for its color, and even upon re-reading the description closely I did not see it stated anywhere that a color (or plain) will be chosen for you. And the description does state that the tweezer has a baked enamel finish - well, not the one I got. It came in a little purple case, but the tweezer itself is just stainless."
5,There is no other brand,"These babies do the job, consistently. They hold up well, especially if not dropped on the tips too often. And you can always send them back for a free sharpening when they eventually lose their precision grip. They really grab those hard to hold fine and short sprouts that others can't handle. Even ingrown hairs. I just won't bother with any other brands anymore. My local CVS can't keep 'em in stock, so thank goodness for Amazon. They are a little more expensive in the short run, but I save in the long run for how long they hold up and work so well."
2,Nazi Justiz,"Nothing original in the book. The author borrows mostly from Raul Hilberg's ""Destruction of the European Jews""---published in 1961, but remaining one of, if not the, seminal works on the Holocaust. Many of the ""stories"" of Nazi perversions in administering the law have been recounted in other works such as Ingo Mueller's ""Furchtbare Juristen"" which is far better researched and written. ""Nazi Justiz"" is not worth reading, much less paying [a lot of money] for. Get a used copy of Hilberg's book for a few dollars."
4,This album rules and proves that Keith is way ahead of his time!,"This album sounds way better than when it was released in 2003. The beats, the flows, everything sounds incredible 5 years later. Keith once again has proved himself way ahead of his time. Definitely worth buying for any real Keith fans."
2,Lost in Space,"The beats on this record are repeatitive and the rhymes lack the creativity for the most part that you expect out of Kool Keith. This is a tough record to listen to in its entirety because of the thick monotony of the music.The best songs are the Sex songs, and if that is the primary reason you like Keith's work than maybe its worth checking out. If you're looking for some of his new stuff to hear, I'd recommend Disel Truckers before the Lost Masters."
3,"KEITH, IS IT ALL DOWN HILL FROM HERE????? I HOPE NOT!","I love Kool Keith. I think he's one of the greatest mc's of all time but I have to say his last two albums have been really disapointing. Although, I do give Keith some credit on this album for bringing back some lyrical memories of his past cd,""Sex Style."" But overall this cd lacks passion and well, sense. He talks about ""piss"" alot which gets kinda old. I dont know, I think Keith needs to get back with either Kutmasta Kurt or Dan the Automator. Keith needs to have at least one more album that will outshine Octo or Doom."
2,They were lost for a reason,"This album is strictly for the truest keith fans. The only reason one should own this album is for the sake of just having it. This is just a bunch of junk that was definatly not good enough for any of his classic joints. I am a giant keith fan, way back, but I only listen to this CD to make the other CDs seem even tighter. Its good for a laugh here and there. But if your trying to decide on a Keith disc to purchase, hit up any of the others, not this one."
2,"Wow, that's pretty bad...",Maybe my expectaions were too high. It's hard to beat an album like Dr. Octagynocologist and Dr. Doom. This album has sick beats and 50% of the songs are about urinating on people. Check out the Deltron 3030 and skip this one.
3,......,"Listenable, but not something I look forward to hearing alot. The production is not that up to par, but the songs are ok. ""Robert Perry"", ""Girls you know"", and ""Taking Pictures"" are the best tracks."
2,lost repeater,keith rehashed not new? what is this coming so wack you sound like you are lost. Love your earlier work. Going to see your show tonight.
5,ANSWER SONGS .. FANTASTIC CD .. HARD TO FIND SONGS,"I purchased this answer song cd, and very happy I did. Memories galore and the sound is fantastic. If you love the old rock n' roll songs, you'll love these songs...Many impossible to find now a days...Don't get left out, it's well worth the money at any price... 75 dollars well spent worth every cent........."
4,"Good, but the big question","for 2008, is why on earth Amazon has started to list the song writer rather than performer for many of the songs on VA (Various artist) compilations.I've noticed this problem all over the site.Listings are chaotic enough. This is gonna cost sales for customers who won't find the performer they are looking for..."
3,Not as good as the Country Answer CD,"This one CD in a double CD box ( a bit strange) holds originals andtheir answer songs of the early 60's. Although there are some greatsongs that became # 1 on the Billboard Charts, the overall collectionis not as good as the Country Answer one. Some answer songs are totallydifferent from their original version which make you wonder if thesewere really meant to be answer songs or just have the title in common.Besides that a lot of these songs can be found on the ACE's wonderfulcollection "" The Answer To Everything""."
3,Plenty of keepers in this collection!,"The only drawback to B-side collections is that when you discover a song that's really, really good, you wonder why the band didn't put IT on the album it was recorded for and leave off some of the garbage they DID put on the album. And so it is with Cup of Sand. ""The Majestic,"" ""Reg"" and ""With Bells On"" are amazing songs that somehow didn't make the cut for Indoor Living; I think they're better than practically anything on Side Two of that album. And ""Her Royal Fisticuffs"" deserved better than languishing on an EP. Cup of Sand also collects some fun covers, acoustic versions of much-loved tracks like ""Detroit Has a Skyline"" and various songs that definitely DIDN'T deserve a spot on an album proper. The accompanying booklet is very meaty, as all four band members weigh in with their memories (or lack thereof) of each track."
3,Some high points,"Overall there are a lot of songs on the two disk set that I consider mediocre compared to the rest of Superchunk's stuff. That said, the acoustic version of ""Detroit Has a Skyline"" alone makes the disc worth purchasing. I'd recommend this as a gift for fans of the band, if you're looking for a first exposure to their music I'd look to some of the earlier releases."
4,Great selection of hits,"Among some new names appearing in the series include The Ready Set, Willow and Far East Movement along with several other familiar ones. What's interesting though is that for the first time, the rock genre is not represented here. The four ""Now What's Next"" tracks are okay but it would have been nice if another track or two were added to utilize the remaining space on the disc. Ten of the tracks reached the Top Ten including seven chart-toppers which is a big improvement over previous volumes. And now for the Billboard Hot 100 peak positions for the tracks.Love The Way You Lie-#1Just The Way You Are-#1Firework-#1Raise Your Glass-#1We R Who We R-#1Only Girl (In The World)-#1Like A G6-#1Hey Baby (Drop It To The Floor)-#7Yeah 3X-#15Stereo Love-#16Whip My Hair-#11No Hands-#13Bottoms Up-#6Please Don't Go-#16Love Like Woe-#27Mine-#3/#1 AC/#2 CountryTT 72:44"
3,its ok,The kids like it. Those last 4 bonus songs are a waste. Theyre unknown artists. We rather have 4 radio popular songs.
2,Lacks Rock Product,"Now 37 consists of a large amount of pop and hip hop hits as all of the ""Now"" albums have. This one however leaves out all rock product.The last 5 Now albums, released by EMI also cut you short on at least 5 hits by replacing them with ""Now What's Next"" featuring unknown songs by unknown artists.Let's hope Now 38 is better."
5,NOW,"I collect the series, music for my driving entertainment. Thanks Amazon for updating and making it easy to keep up with the current sounds."
4,Now That's What I Call Music #37 review,"I love that I can get a wide range of popular music in one album and not need to buy multiple albums to get each song. The artists are all favorites, so it was worth the purchase. I even have That's What #38, #40, and That's What, Party mix. I love all their albums . The only thing is there are a few songs that I'm m not to crazy about. Overall it is a great album and I am happy with the purchase."
1,Major disappointment.,"Sometimes it only takes one bad recipe to ruin a cookbook for me, and that's what happened with this one. Susan Purdy's apricot-walnut pie turned out to be a soggy, way oversweet mess, and I didn't use half the sugar she called for. I've been making pies a long time, and I had questions about this recipe from the get-go. Her crust recipes are good, however, although it's annoying that she never tells you, when adding an ingredient like wheat germ to a crust, whether said ingredient replaces part of the dry ingredients called for, or is added to them. Seems like a major oversight in a book that promises to clearly communicate pie recipes."
2,Wish I could say it was better,"I wanted a Justin Tubb CD in my collection in the worst way. I found this and made a very disapointing discovery. Most of these songs are very pedestrian. Very few of these songs are worth listening to more than once, if you can get through them once. He was marketed to the younger audience and that is what I believe lowered the quality of his music. I know there is better music in the vaults somewhere from Justin Tubb."
1,Nothing New,"I bought this book hoping for a new spin on Bookbinding lit. It turned out to be more of the same: lots more stab bindings. The explanations are vague as well. The chapter on Scroll-making was interesting, but overall, this book is not worth the price. If you have other bookbinding books, there's nothing new here."
4,Was she worth more than Steve?,Yes shy was and what about inflation what would she be worth today ? This series was great in the true traditional way the bionic man was done sometimes there was a blurr to whitch of the shows you wre watching because of the back and forth guest appearences on each others shows! But a great trip down memory lane.
4,It's the end of the world as we know it,"*The* classic episode of the bionic woman. Sure, it's got cheese--laser cannons, the Russian dude's goofy electronic jammer thing that sounds like a telephone--but hey, it's the 70s. It features an engaging storyline about a serious issue--nuclear proliferation--handled well in a sci-fi setting. This first part serves really as an extended set up for the second half: Jaime's face off with the computer, the Alex 7000. Yes, Alex is a shameless ripoff of Hal 9000, but it works."
5,LOVE THE ORIGINAL BIONIC WOMAN,What can I say? It is Lindsay Wagner at her best as she plays the Bionic Woman. I was very glad that Bionic Woman was finally released on DVD - now I can watch it as much as I want. It is a great gift for friends and family members who grew up during the era of this show.
3,Great memories,I have watched my videos and with the exception of some sound problems on one of the disk I was not dissapointed. It was a total blast from the past. Although the effects are a little cheesy by todays standards the stories were very good.
1,Return of the Bionic Woman,"Excited at the post office to see it finally arrived! Watching the DVD with childlike glee, I was disappointed when the DVD picture pixlelated, sound still played but the picture didn't return until the end of that episode. Same with mulitple episodes. I returned the product for an exchange, same thing. I returned that one and once again the same thing. I am hoping if there is a second printing, they will have worked out the problem. I tired them in two different blu-ray and one dvd player, same problem each time."
4,Bionic action,"I have really enjoyed season 2 of The Bionic Woman (I also have season 1). There are several cross over episodes with Jaime Sommer's love Steve Austin from the Six Million Dollar man. In this collection you have Jaime Sommer play a card dealer aboard a Cruising Ship, a Nashville Singer, A woman wrestler and so much more. My favorite episodes was ""Kill Oscar"" that had 3 parts where Jaime (and Steve Austin) fought those woman robots called ""Fembots"". There are also commentaries and special sections with Lindsey Wagner and others. This was my favorite show and I look forward to the rest of the Seasons!"
2,disappointed withn disc 4 i'm so angry,i was so excited tofind out when bionic woman was coming to dvd and i have waited solong for this and when i started watching season 2 disc 4 titled DEADLY RINGER I was so angry that the audio was not functioning for the first ten minutes and I could not believe it. So I called my other friends and found out they encountered the same problems and everyone is upset. Universal should replace all these defective discs because business should not be handled this way and as fans we are all upset. please do something to correct this problem by recalling this product and replacing the disc . we have waited years for this and it's just so frustrating and disappointing to have this happen please do the right thing by your fans because i know lindsay would not approve
1,Audio defect,"I'm going to add my voice to the crowd of the disappointed that this release went out the door with the audio issues. I thought I heard something slightly off on ""Doomsday is Tomorrow"" but let it pass until starting ""Deadly Ringer"" only to find I can't hear any dialog for the first 9 1/2 minutes. Unacceptable. I'm debating now on whether I should return my set or not. I bought the set instead of renting because I believed I would enjoy multiple re-watches. However, now I think the audio issues will be more of a distraction than a pleasure viewing experience.Long time to wait for such a terrible disappointment."
4,Bionic Woman Season 2 Audio Problem.,"I have all three seasons of The Bionic Woman on DVD. Season 1 and 2 are UK import (2005) and season 3 (German import) released in March 2011.I just watched Deadly Ringer from season 2 and had no audio problem. I was wondering why it was not possible to remaster the season and then get the audio from the 2005 / 2006 UK import release on DVD. With the exception of ""The Return of Bigfoot Part II"" is not on the UK release. Maybe they should negotiate a deal with the owners of the UK Import."
1,You've Got To Be Kidding??,This release of BW Season 2 has got to be one of the worst manufactured DVD sets I've ever purchased. I can't believe a studio would ever put something of this poor quality out on the market for purchase. The audio tracks are absolutely terrible on most of the DVD's and there are freeze problems on discs 4 & 5. Where is quality control these days?? Don't they even view their own product to make sure it works first? I truly regret now having disposed of my European copies of Season 1&2 after deciding to purchase these newer releases. Unbelievable!
3,"lyrics dark, yes.....music, no","This is a very good album, with very dark lyrics. Musically, it is in the vein of light heavy metal. This album is not as dark as say ""Closer"" by Joy Division or even ""3rd / Sister Lovers"" by Big Star. An enjoyable album, if not just a little overrated."
5,All age readers can learn about Alcott here,"The unusual approach taken by Delamar here, is to give a biography of Louisa May Alcott, but then follow it up with an entire section devoted to Alcott's most famous book, ""Little Women"" as it was viewed from 1868 on, and then take both scholars' and average readers' assessments of it's place today. I liked that. It gave dimension. I think it shows scholarly research, but is written in language the average reader can read."
3,"cd in good condition, hated the music..",was it appears to be a very early record of the band and not good.... surprised they were allowed to continue in there career....
4,Should have done this years ago,"I don't have the Configurations system, but I did have a jumbled mess of shoes in my closets for (I'm ashamed to say) years. This shoe cubby unit is just what the doctor ordered. It's heavier than I expected and yes, it would be nice if each cubby was a tad larger so it could more easily fit a pair of adult-size shoes, but overall I'm delighted with it. I just put it on the floor of my closet. Definitely a huge improvement."
2,Sexist,"These are great for little ""womens"" shoes. However, for men who want organization, these are too small... except for flip-flops. Please design something for real people. Wait... don't... I'll do that myself and make a fortune."
1,BEWARE!! VERY SMALL SHOES ONLY!!,"BEWARE! The picture on the front of the box is very misleading. The assembly was easy..I had no intention of mounting it on brackets, but still it was very easy to assemble. Problem is, I couldn't fit even one sneaker into the cubby spaces. I'm a man with a size 10 shoe..pretty average. I tried to put one sneaker from a pair of size 10 Nike Shox ..couldn't get it in without jamming it. Then I tried a pair of leather loafers..size 10. ONLY one shoe fit. Unless you have tiny feet, or are using it for kids 10 years old and under..don't bother with this product. One good thing..it disassembles just as quickly. Back in the box and I'm returning it to Lowe's tonight. They need to either change the box photo..or tell people that it only fits small shoes. VERY SMALL SHOES ONLY."
1,All colors are printed in black,"There's a lot of talk about the color with color charts but all the pages in the book are printed in black and in low resolution, so the book is really a waste of money.Very disappointed."
1,Not worth buying,"Everything in this book is taught by the second day of an Intoduction to Graphic Design at any community college program. Google graphic design and you can learn everything this book has to offer in 5 minutes. There are tons of books on websites dealing with HTML and CSS, I was looking for one dealing with the design of a site. If you are looking for the same, keep looking. This one's not it."
5,JUMP to the Next Level,"JUMP Ultimate Stars is a must have for any anime/manga fan. Almost every character from Shonen Jump manga is represented in this game, and thats a lot of people: over 300 to be more exact! This provides for nearly infinite replay value. Players unlock new characters by completing the story mode. You can then evolve them to make them stronger, and use them to do battle. Multiplayer play is great. And if you cant find anyone else with the game, people can always download from you with their DS, or you can challege the world in a WIFI match! Even though the language is in Japanese, the menu options are straight forward and easy to memorize once you know what they are. I recommend finding a guide on the net, or you might get frustrated trying to figure out what the missions are in story mode. You will never get bored with this game. It may be one of the best DS fighting games out there, and it is worth every extra penny to get it imported!---OtakuMan"
5,ROCKTRONIC! A NEW GENRE!!,Masterful blend of high energy electronic rhythms and INTER-STELLER melodic rock guitar. Very original music!
1,I'd have better success by blowing on my passengers,This unit wasn't able to provide much heat at all. I would not recommend this product at all.
5,what a blessing we have this book,"The obvious problem this author has is that if you have not given birth or are not thinking about it, you may not be that interested in the topic. Actually, Caton does quite a good job of showing how debates about use of anesthesia in childbirth tie in to larger cultural debates about medicine, progress, and the meaning of pain. In simple language, and with a good effort at giving all points of view fairly, he goes over both the scientific history of how drugs became available for childbirth and the social history of how the public (including doctors) responded. Yes, I did read it just after I had my child -- and I enjoyed it. I live in Japan where the debate over ``natural'' childbirth rages on. I think this book would make a nice gift for your intelligent friend who's having a baby (for goodness' sake, she'll get enough stuffed animals from other people)."
1,Disappointed,The polish I got is very old and seperated.. and the color is muddy and not true at all to the picture. I can do nothing with it but throw it away... So just be warned.. The picture looks like there is a lot of coppery orange.... the one I got is matt and dull and more of a earth tone. Really ugly.:(
1,Poor Service,I did not recieve this item until about a week after it was supposed to be here. They never sent an email or called. When I called them they were very rude. Since it was so late I didnt need it any longer. They told me they would not give a full discount and I still had to pay shipping and handling. I decided to go ahead and keep it since I was not going to get all my money back. But it looks nothing like the picture shows. we had to make modifications to make it fit right. And I still do not like it. I would not reccomend this company to anyone.
1,Be on your guard!,"If you wish to order a new, unused, item, do not pay anything until you receive confirmation that the product you wish to order actually is brand new. Otherwise you may end up with an expensive, second hand object which you cannot return. Requests thereto are ignored."
5,Love this series!,"My kids love to watch this series on PBS.It is great to have them on DVD because they can watch something educational on long car rides, and in hotels without children's programming.Would highly recommend."
5,unforgettable,"This scent makes you unforgettable. The first time I smelled it on a co-worker, I knew I had to have it!! Everyone comments on it and tells me what a nice fragrence it is. I LOVE IT!"
1,Very Disappointed,"I never received this product...got an email that my account had been credited but was very disappointed with this transaction, as this has never happened before in the entire time I have been purchasing from Amazon.Jackie Weishaar"
1,Not a good buy,"I owned a Farberware Convection oven for 25 years and wanted to replace it. This is NOT the way to go. The machine lost 5-10 minutes a week and the temperature was not accurate. The outside of the oven was too hot to touch when in use. The cord was too short to work without an extension cord when set up against the wall on the hinge side. It only took a couple of days to know that this was not for me. The seller - OrangeOnions - didn't accept returns on opened and ""used"" items so it took 3 months to get a refund going thru the warranty company. I would strongly encourage anyone to look for another convection."
1,Misreprensentation,The whol description is wrong. For starters the dimensions are not for the inside of the oven or even the outside but it's for THE BOX IT SHIPPED IN!I have a Farberware convection oven that I purchased in 1982 and it is far better than this one. This is nothing more than a glorified toaster/oven. The space required for safety precludes using it in the space I have. I suspect that that it loses too much heat (energy) to make it cost efficient. My old Farberware convection is larger and doesn't require this additional space at sides and back.I hope this is not the normal object that Amazon will ace as a supplier for. If this is so then I will only buy books and CDs from you. Shame on you.
2,Wish they made the old version,"I would like to purchase a new Farberware convection oven with the rotisserie but in good faith I can not. After reading all the reviews and having one of the first ones made (have since bought several on ebay to give to family)I am sad to say, ""They just don't make them like they use to!"".One of the best features of the older models was that the oven was able to roast a 12lb turkey, really large roasts, etc.The unit was easy to maintain and repair. You could dehydrate in it and slow cook.I was tempted to buy a new one (would keep the old too) for the rotisserie and any updated features. But alas, it seems quality has suffered too much."
2,Cheap construction is a deal-breaker,"I just finished unpacking my oven and plugging it in. I am so disappointed by the quality of construction that it's going right back in the box and back to the merchant. The door is not square with the frame and jiggles back and forth on its hinges, the pushbuttons are cheap chrome-plated plastic with dimples in the middle from a shoddy molding process, and the control panel label is stick-on vinyl that doesn't fit properly and is already beginning to peel up. The stainless steel cabinet is so thin, I can see dents in the side where the screws go in. I'm surprised Farberware has put their name on such a piece of junk."
3,Defective model,"Oven works great except after 4 months LED burned out inside panel. When I contacted Salton the first time they stated the light was purely cosmetic and said they wouldn't replace it. I contacted them a couple weeks later after the second LED burned out. I told them the lights were a part of the functional usage, considering if all 6 burned out you wouldn't know if you were baking, broiling, toasting, defrosting, keeping warm or in rotisserie mode.The person I reached was very helpful this time and I was able to return it to the store for a replacement.It is now seven months using the replacement and the LED burned out. They are having me send it back...I am not sure if this is a fluke or just a poor design. It's dissapointing considering it's nearly a 300.00 oven."
1,Piece of Junk,"You know that the quality control at a factory is horrible when a $200 piece of countertop appliance comes dented and missing parts. Couple that with the very low quality buttons, over tightened screws, and GLARING blue light, it is amazing that something like this even sells. I shouuld have checked with the reviews other than Amazon prior to purchasing, because it is definitely inflated here."
3,"Completely implausible...but a cute, worthwhile rental","If you're a fan of classic Spanish cinema in the Pedro Almodóvar style, then consider 'Km. 0' (alternatively known as 'Kilómetro Cero' and 'Kilometer Zero' in its international releases) as one bowl of Almodóvar Lite. The script and tone have Almodóvar-like chance intersections and misunderstandings between characters (as well as its sexual openness) that send the screenplay skittering off in new directions. However, while Almodóvar is the master of the shock revelation and feel that expertly walks the border between drama and masterful comedic touch, 'Km. 0' is trite, superficial and completely implausible. And, by the way, a pretty nice little rental. It's 105 minutes of digestible, enjoyable fluff that's just right for a Saturday night showing in your living room. Just don't expect the movie to resonate with you the next morning."
3,"Fun, silly, and light",Very light. Like you won't be affected by it at all other than it is entertaining and nicely pieced-together. It goes a little awry at the end (as others have noted) but is okay overall.There is a wonderful exaggerated song toward the last third that is my favorite part and which seems to cause everyone's fortunes to improve. If only it were that simple.Worth a watch. Not epic. Okay overall.
5,"One of the best books I've read in a long, long time.","Up until recently I never even knew there was an omnibus novel of Star Trek Movies II, III and IV.It was only in talking to a friend of mine that I came to learn of it's existence, and they compelled me to find it on Amazon and read it.It's worth noting that I /just/ finished reading the book a couple days ago, and good lord, I found out so many more details about those three movies by reading this book.For any true Star Trek fan, this is a ""Must Have"" in any collection, big or small."
1,"TEDIOUS, EXCEPTIONALLY BORING BOOK","As a reader of everything from James Joyce to Stephen King, this book has to be in the bottom ten of everything I've ever read. The story is sooo far-fetched. The plot always conveniently turns the way the main character would like it to. And, there is about 200 pages of superflous material involving the political climate in Greece that should be left out entirely - it really makes no difference to the main storyline.The characters are unbelievable, let alone the plot. I ended up skimming through much of the book after the first 100 pages. This is a Harlequin romance for wannabe MBA's. Thank God I didn't buy this book!"
5,Works on hound dog ears,"This stuff will leave your dogs' ears smelling rosemary clean. My groomer uses it and HIGHLY recommended it for keeping up on my Basset Hounds' ears. You squirt some in to each ear and massage it around a bit, let it soak to get all the deep seated mung primed and ready to go and I use rough weave medical pads to get the bits out. Disgusting I know, but after 5+ years of using this stuff I can only think of 1 or 2 times when one of my Bassets, with their big heavy ears, ever got an ear infection."
5,An Excellent Guide to Consciousness and Inspirational Living,"This book about my innerwealth is remarkable in its precious simplicity. I hear so many people, especically at work, talk about wanting balance and inspiration in daily life. And finally here is a clear guide to such harmony and the bonus, it is with nature on your side! I am fascinated by how the wisdom of the 5 laws of nature are so easily found in everyday life yet also so ignored by others who are stuck. This book speaks to me in a direct and boldly confronting way and yet it resonates with a gentle ""Aha"" deep within the core of my being. Just the spark I need to remind me of how great life is. A remarkable exploration into how life is meant to be. I get more every time I read it."
5,Made a Great Gift,"I bought this book to give to our choir director as a going away gift. I didn't read it, but he did, and he thought it was a great addition to his library."
2,How can I keep from Groaning?,"Perhaps I'm being too cruel. This was a ""Nice"" book. Ms Goldsmith has thoughtfuly considered the activity which gives her the most joy in life: emotionally, philisophically and even technically (from a layman's point-of-view). I felt as if I was reading her diary...that the diary had been written with me peering over her shoulder. I was very uncomfortable with that--as if she was waiting for my acknowlegement or approval.The subtitle speaks of 'Music and the Passionate Life', but Ms Goldsmith's writing implies that she's seeking little more than comfort in life. Ho-hum.Exploration of human experience or gooey sentiment? I prefer mine dry, I suppose. Make me laugh, make me cry, just don't expect for me to sit still when you rattle on...."
3,The 20th century children's book treasury,"My daughter purchased this book on my behalf, so I haven't actually seen it, however from the report from my grandaughter my great grandaughter is delighted with it. I live in the UK, my daughter who ordered it is in Spain and my Grandaughter and Great Grandaughter live in the United States, so it was very convenient to order it this way.The only disappointment was the delivery time! If the company sent out the order a little quicker I would have awarded more stars. My Great Grandaughter's Birthday was long gone by the time it reached her!"
5,Wonderful Collection,When my children were young we read from this almost every night. It contains many of the favorite stories that I grew up with as a kid. It is a must for any parent's library.
4,Cheaper Than Buying Individual Books,"I think of this as the Costco version of children's books. You save a ton by buying in volume. The downside? Not all the illustrations in the original editions are present here. Specifically, I noticed this with Curious George. Really young readers appreciate a high picture-to-word ratio, so when the editors cut back on some of the illustrations, the stories are not as easy to follow along. Older children probably will not mind."
3,Lack and Quality of Illustrations a Major Disappointment.,"Though a fairly inexpensive way to get a decent collection of children's stories, I found it disappointing, mainly because most of the stories were missing many of their illustrations, or else the pictures were shrunken down to fit the book's format. Illustrations are a MAJOR reason why certain books become favorites, and this collection edits out a majority of the beloved picures in almost all of it's selections. Also, given that this book had to present illustrations in a shrunkendown format, stories such as Madeline were poorly chosen for this book. (The pics for this story, though all included, are so small that you really can't enjoy the full impact of the magnificent artwork which is the charm of the Madeline books.) The description provided of this collection neglected to indicate that many illustrations were missing- I probably wouldn't have ordered the book if this had been clear."
4,Nice but problematic for the youngest kids,"While this is a beautiful book and a present that we loved, one does lose something when you can't turn the pages of a book. Our two-year-old loves trains and the Berenstein bears, so he loves Freight Train and the Bears story included in the collection, but he has trouble concentrating on the story when he can look ahead. There's something magical about finding something new on each page for the youngest readers and that sense is lost with this collection. This should improve as he begins to read the older stories that are more text-based."
3,Classic together!!!,"Great book to have, I like it because I got it for a very low price, I wouldn't want to pay the full price becasue lets face it you are not going to like every single story in it.Note to Muslim parents: there are some stories which have a pictures and/or name of pig or it's meat. So think before you buy or do what I did. You can cut pictures of other animals from magazines to cover Pig's Pictures."
5,great for children and adults,"We bought this book for our two boys, one is 7 and one is 3. They love these classic books, and we love them because we remember reading some of these same stories as children. We each let them choose a story and we read it to them before bedtime. It is much easier to carry around one big book vs. many small books. We have really enjoyed this book."
5,#1 on the preschool hit parade,"My 3 and 4 1/2 year old boys love this book. The only problem is there are so many stories they like, they want me to sit there and read story after story after story! I've been introduced to a lot of great children's lit that I've never been aware of before. Yes, I'd quibble with a few of the choices, and yes, it would be nice if you could have all the pictures in their full-size format, but when you're getting 44 stories for the price of 4, you can't complain too much. It may even prompt me to go out and buy a couple of the kids' favorite stories in the regular format so they can see all the pictures (say, Swimmy), which I'm sure would delight all of the publishing parties involved. Read and enjoy!"
2,A TWO Star only to be fair,"I was really disappointed to see that many books in here were abridged. Also, although the book is large in its dimensions, some of the chosen books had multiple small pictures per page. In addition, some of the stories were great choices but a lot of them were not the best ones either. I saw this book in the library and checked it out immediately and was so glad that I did not purchase it. An EXCELLENT compilation of picture books to buy would be ""A Treasury of Picture Books"" from publisher Harper Collins. That is by far the best children's book we own. I will always keep that one as an heirloom. Check out my review for that book."
5,A wonderful collection,"This is the best single-volume collection of children's picture book stories I have seen. My children had many of the stories in softcover editions and most of these translate well in the format of this collection. Others were entirely new to us. Many truly classic children's stories are in this book and most of the best children's picture book authors are represented. The book is versatile: you can take this one volume on a trip and not need any other story book for your preschooler. The only drawback is that in some instances, not all of the illustrations for a particular story are included or the illustrations are much smaller than in the original book. However, the quality of the printing and paper is excellent, so this is not a distraction. My 4-year-old pulls this book off of the shelf every night."
5,An excellent start to any child's library,"We received this book as a baby gift for our now-10-year old son, and it has been a bedtime story basic ever since. It comes with us on vacation! All our children enjoy it, and love to find their favorite stories. If you're looking for an excellent way to start off a child's library, this is the book for you."
4,Wonderful book!,"My 3-year-old demands no fewer than 2 or 3 bedtime stories per night, so while planning a week plus trip out of state I was concerned about how to pack reading material. After reading the previous reviews, I decided to take a chance and order this book. Good decision! Yes, some of the illustrations are small, or missing alltogether, but it made little difference to him. Many of his favorites were here as well as some new favorites! This is a fantastic book for travel and would make a wonderful gift. In fact, I'm back to order it for a friend. By the way...I wish I'd seen this before I dished out hundreds of dollars on hardcover children's stories!"
4,A wonderful book of concise picture stories.,"This is truly a great book to have in any library, but if you are a real bibliophile, then you must also have the original single book versions of the stories you really like. The reason I say this is because in the interest of whittling the book down to size, many of the original illustrations have been cut from the stories. I don't know about you, but looking at all the beautiful pictures was half the fun of reading these books when I was small. It is convenient to have all these stories in one volume."
5,Got as a baby gift...will be giving it as gifts in the future. Just lovely!,"I got this book as a baby gift for my daughter. It is just wonderful. It has all of my favorite stories from childhood (70's and 80's) as well as some new ones for us to explore together. I will be buying this as a baby gift for others in the future. And, it's great to travel with so you don't have to bring lots of books along."
1,What have you done?!?!,"The twentieth century has produced some brilliant picture books, and the editor of this collection has selected well. However, . . . in the best picture books the text and the pictures truly synergize. Stripping many, many of the pictures away from the text destroys many of these classic books. Shame, Shame on you. Clearly this was conceived and executed as a money making gimmick, with little regard for the art of children's literature."
1,A crime against children's literature,"If you believe USA Today is a great newspaper, People is a great magazine and McDonald's is a great restaurant, this is the book for you. Or perhaps Reader's Digest is more analogous. The integrity of many great works of children's literature is destroyed by cutting them up and editing them as in this ""treasury."" The world moves too fast as it is, and taking the time to snuggle up with the complete versions of these books is one of the great gifts we can give our children and ourselves. It is a tragedy that thousands of children will miss out on that experience while ingesting this ""fast read,"" ""fast look"" version."
3,Not quite what I remember...,"While I agree with the other reviews about the quality of the books chosen for this compendium, I have been a bit disappointed with it in that many of the books have been edited substantially with regards to the illustrations. Also, it's not quite the same when you see many pages of the book printed small on one page. So, while I don't regret buying it, I've found my childhood memories somewhat truncated in it. Especially with the Story of Babaar- I miss seeing the pictures!"
1,"Mini-Pics, if at all","What is the point of a giant picture book with the pictures missing, reduced to 1 inch square, or who knows what else since I haven't read all the real versions. Also the words have been lifted from the pictures (surely due to the reduced picture size) which is also hurting the artistic work."
2,My View of The Testemony of the Evangelists,"This book was written by a Lawyer for a Lawyer. It is steeped in the rhetoric common to all Legal discourse. It is generally difficult to follow, and about as interesting to read as the Federal Tax code. If one is able to wade through the dense and pedantic jargon, there appears to be something of value within its covers. But, no reader should have to work so hard to glean understanding from any work written in their own language. If the Bible were written by Lawyers, then hell is all we could ever hope for."
3,More -- And Less -- Than Advertised,"This volume isn't exactly what one would expect from the title on the cover. The book is not an extended analysis of the Gospels, but a collection of essays, only one of which (Greenleaf's ""Examination of the Testimony of the Evangelists"") makes any attempt at rigorous analysis of the Gospels. Greenleaf adds a second essay on ""An Account of the Trial of Jesus,"" and this slim volume is rounded out by ""The Jewish Account of the Trial of Jesus"" by Joseph Salvador, ""The Trial of Jesus before Caiaphas and Pilate"" by M. Dupin, and ""The Various Versions of the Bible"" by Constantine Tischendorf."
1,pathatic lies,"In answear to the work of modern bible researchers like Crossan,Borg and Funk, Fundamentilsts are popping out of the woodwork and using Mr.Greenleafs work to defend thier ideas. Becuase the resurrection stories vastly contradict each other Greenleaf claims this must be true? With this bizzare logic all u.f.o.,bigfoot,and loch ness monster tales must be true if the tales contradict each other! Don't belive the hype."
5,The Witnesses,"Simon Greenleaf does excellent work the the book ""The Testimony of the Evangelist: The Gospels Examined by the Rules of Evidence."" The writers of the Gospels are accepted as writers of historical evidence. The evidence presented is handled as any other book dealing with a historical topic. They wrote about the historical figure of Jesus Christ, a person with whom they had either association or not far removed by only a short few years. Greenleaf does us a favor in compilig the fact of each of these writers. Easy reading. It is recommended."
5,Amazing book!,"I first was introduced to this book at the age of 21, and I think it is a fanatastic book. The Lord used it to radically change my perspective of my relationship with Him and of future relationships.Jones and Kendall walk you through 10 godly characteristics that are displayed in the life of Ruth (from the Bible). Step by step, they show you how you can have a personal, intimate, love relationship with Jesus Christ, who is the Only One who can ever make us complete, satisfied, and content.Though it is made clear that marriage is not a guarentee for some, we are shown that God promises to bless us if we seek Him first, and allow Him to fulfill us and be our Heavenly Bridegroom.I would highly recommend this book to any single ladies group of any age.Also, if you enjoyed Lady In Waiting, you may also likePassion and Purity,: Learning to Bring Your Love Life Under Christs Controlby Elizabeth Elliot."
5,Not just another devotional for single women,"I'm not much for reading the latest devotionals; I usually just read my Bible. But this one has been around a few years and is worth looking into. The chapters are short and packed with wisdom for single Christian women--I've only read three of them, and I'm hooked! I thought I was living a fairly contented single life before I started reading this book, but it has already brought about some much-needed attitude adjustments in me. If you want to start living joyfully instead of just impatiently, you need to read Lady in Waiting."
5,Lady in Waiting,"It can be tough out there in the dating world! Lady in Waiting is a great book that helps you put your ""single status"" into persepective while pleasing the Lord every step of the way."
5,Absolutely Awesome!,"This book does such a wonderful job of explaining the main points and there are scriptures to back it up. For those who are worried about this being a ""preachy"" book it is not. It lays it out in a godly way and asks you the questions. I went throught this book in less that a week and am reading it again! This is also a good Bible study book. Highly reccommend this for any woman read this in today's society. With the pressure to either be 100% career minded or you're not complete if you are alone young ladies need help. Get this for your teenage daughters, for your friends and yourself! It is worth it!"
3,Good for young women,"I am very hard to please when it comes to reading Christian books. So much same old thing out there. This book is is very well written and filled with great application for Christians who are seeking relationships. Some of the authors interpretation of scripture content is inaccurate, but good reading.Reviewed by Dr. Tikki Collins Author of ""Lord Put A Ring On It"""
1,EMERGENT CHURCH/NEW AGE!,"This book teaches contemplative prayer and meditating. I was shocked and disappointed. The purpose of contemplative prayer is to enter an altered state of consciousness in order to find one's true self, thus finding God. This true self relates to the belief that man is basically good. Proponents of contemplative prayer teach that all human beings have a divine center and that all, not just born again believers, should practice contemplative prayer.""Sparked by Eastern meditative techniques, today's version of centering prayer is bent on stilling the mind.""A Quiet Revolution--JODI MAILANDER FARRELLDid Jesus instruct his followers to empty their minds through contemplative prayer?On the contrary He said,""You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul and with all your MIND.""Matthew 22:37 [NKJV]This is why I respectfully yet firmly give ""Lady in Waiting"" a 1 star review."
3,Uncertain,"I liked this book becuase it showed me that you really need to wait on God's timing for everything. However, I felt like this book was TOOOO religous and I felt like it tried to make me feel guilty for not trying to study the bible intensively. I am a Christian but I am not very religous. I felt like there was too much biblical refrence rather than actual guidance."
5,Fast shipment.,"Another gift for my daughter. Its a book fhat was recommended by our youth pastor for all the young women, hopefully she will read."
5,Amazing...,"If I had to describe this book in one word, it would be AWESOME! I've yet to move past chapter one, and this book has changed my whole perspective on Mr. Right. One statement that stood out to me, was the definition of a woman, it really helped me to stop judging myself based on what society said, and start examining who I am based on what God says. If you are contemplating on buying this book, DON'T, just buy it! It will help you and any other woman in your life. I'm actually using it in youth church as topics of discussion. Remember to open your heart and mind as you read, and ask God to help you to take the neccessary steps while waiting on Mr. Right. God Bless :-)"
5,"Amazing Book for a lady in waiting, or one who's no longer in waiting!","Hi there! This book is an excellent resources! I suggest anyone to read it. I have been refering it to just about EVERY woman I know since I finished reading it. I have yet to do the study journal part of the expanded edition, but I hope to have time to dedicate to that soon enough. :) A VERY good read! I suggest it to counselors who will be counseling women, too. I plan on buying another copy to one day use for that as soon as I can afford it. :)"
4,I am a lady in waiting...,"I read Lady in Waiting several years ago while still in my early teens. I have refered back to it many times since then trying to grow my relationship with the Lord while I wait on my future husband. I agree that our ultimate goal is to be satisfied completely with Christ and His cross, but that is something we as humans won't be able to completely attain until we are in Heaven with Christ. Strive for contentedness yes, and find your significance in Him, but it's ok to long for a husband. Don't dwell on it, but to deny and ignore the longings of your heart to me is almost like denying and ingnoring the One who placed them there in the first place.In short, this is a great read and a great example of how to mold your life after the One who gave you life. Strive for holiness, but rely on the One who is holy to make you holy, and wait on His timing for your future husband, He will send him when you both are ready."
2,Did not enjoy.,"After reading the reviews on here, I thought, WOW this must be an amazing book! Turns it, it was just ok. They don't really offer any new or practical insight to things. Also, what I don't like is someone telling me ""well, one day when you have worked really hard serving God and deserve a husband, maybe you'll get one"".Books like this tend to treat the wait as a sort of spiritual penance that one barters to God in exchange for a desired outcome.This book in no way led me towards any type of spiritual journey or caused me to want to be closer to God. If you are looking for a life changing book on a personal relationship with the Lord, read Captivating by Stasi Eldredge. It's a much more spiritually thought out book than I felt this one too be. This was plain and lacking in true testimonies of people. It only contained watered down stories of single women. Blah."
4,Good book to Understand God and yourself a lil' better.,"I'm still in the process of reading this book, but so far so good. I wanted to find a book that would help myself and my purpose of being a Christian women and how I can serve the Lord. This book does just that and it allows you to question yourself, as well as learn about who you are and can become to be. I think this book also gives you hope and understanding of being a single christian women. I'm really appreciating this book it help me understand a whole and makes me want to better myself as a follower of Christ. I think this book is perfect for any women, of any age, or f any marital status. I also think this would also good for a man to read it provides a lot of understanding and purpose for anyone really. Good book read over all."
5,"Very good, and very funny.","I absolutly love this show it's very funny, with it's comedic moments whenever Sana is in one of her funny moods, or if she's hitting Akito with her hammer when he tries to get close to her. In ways the show is very emmotional when you see how the characters are reacting to tradegy, or a love moment between one character and another. I truly give this series five stars up and I reccomend this series to any new anime fan and many other shows as well from the 1990s to now like Pokemon, and Digimon etc. I garuntee that new anime fans will love this romantic comedy story."
5,Perfect for the Lay Reader,"A very readable layman's introduction to the ""secrets"" of how modern Bibles are translated. Chapter 10: Science Comes to the Aid of Bible Translators diagrams how meaning is identified in the Hebrew or Greek and reproduced into English according to the ""criterion of closest natural equivalence ... the touchstone of faithful translation--the guarantee of both accuracy and acceptability"" (p. 109).This ""closest natural equivalence,"" which is more widely denoted by the term ""dynamic equivalence,"" itself has been kidnapped by some Bible publishers for their own work--notably the God's Word version. They use the term to mean something between dynamic equivalence and formal (""literal"") equivalence. But if you've read this book, you'd know who said it first!"
3,Chilton Explainations,"Chilton, Leaves something to be desired when it comes to explaining where things are located!I'd rather use Haynes"
2,"love good smelling stuff, this is not it","Unfortunately I have a Target brand that smells better. I purchased this product thinking it has the same baby magic scent as the rest of the baby magic products I just purchased, which has the wonderful scent of the old baby magic I remembered. This powder has practically no scent at all. Very diasppointed"
4,The Renaissance book is better,This one is still good. It keeps my 4 year old son interested enough. The Renaissance one it his favorite though.
1,Don't waste your money!,"This product is awful. I received it Monday and shipped it back Tuesday. It looks great on TV, but they negect to mention in the infomercial that you need to stop and readjust after every few reps because the machine keeps scooting back on the floor. My lower back really started to hurt after just a few minutes. That is the primary reason I sent it back so soon. Hopefully, I will receive a refund; however, I still wasted the $19.95 the company charged me for shipping and $16.00 to ship it back!"
2,HUGE WAIST OF MONEY!!,"I borrowed this machine from my mom after she purchased it from the infomercial because she never used it. We both agreed that it was a huge waist of money (it's a good thing I didn't pay anything for it). Not only does it scoot back and you keep having to readjust, it left a huge oil mark from the wheel on my carpeting. And I didn't feel no burn either!!"
1,Should be zero stars,"I got a lot of lower back pain within a few minutes of using this product, and a little while later, upper back, shoulder and neck pain followed, as well as sore knees. This is so hard on the body, I cant believe the amount of pain I am in after using this! And its supposed to be low/no impact??? Yeah right! The lower back pain lasts two days, neck and shoulder pain go away probably the following day. I only used it a few times, spaced out between 5 or 6 days, as if I used it every day I wouldnt be able to walk! Or sit for that matter because of the strain and spasms in my lower back. It is disassembled now ready to be shipped back to the company. Oh, and it also moves across the floor, it inches backward with EVERY rep, but only about every second rep do you have to re-adjust either where your feet are, or where the machine is sitting. All around bad product."
1,its not work like TV !!,"hi,i agree with G. Woodsthis item not work like TVIt looks great on TV, but they negect to mention in the infomercial that you need to stop and readjust after every few reps because the machine keeps scooting back on the floor.i do not like it :("
2,BUN & THIGH ROLLER,"I have a warning for anyone with Arthritis in their hands or wrists! Do not use this product. I have Rheumatoid Arthritis and I did not realize how much pressure is put on the hands and wrists while using this item. Almost your entire weight rests on the handlebars of this machine! My right thumb has been numb for nearly two weeks now, but this is finally starting to go away.You MUST be healthy to enjoy the benefits of the BUN & THIGH ROLLER!Well, back to Pilates for me!"
4,"Works great, but does slide back","I really do think this product works great. i can feel the burn, and it really does lift my butt and tone my thighs. It does slide back on the carpet however, so if this is going to be something you think bothers you, dont get it. If you dont mind re-adjusting in between reps, its well worth it...I mean dont people realize that gravity and weight are going to take affect? Of course its going to slide back, but it still works great."
3,HELP!!,I really think I want to buy one of these but i like to know what the people think before i do. So if you could would you write a review that tells me if this product is worth $60. Does it really work like they say it does?
1,Stage Bank Robberies!?,"Stage Bank Robberies!? My god what are they thinking? It's bad enough that games promoting murder, robbery and mayhem are available for teenagers. Now Mattel wants even younger kids to become criminals. When I was a kid playing cops and robbers, it was difficult finding someone to be the bad guy. Now even Mattel is encouraging kids to mastermind criminal activities.This is a fun product and kids have loved hotwheels for generations. If they would just change the wording I could recommend this product. Stop promoting criminal activity!"
4,nice color,I love this sleeve and bought it to keep my arms from bruising due to bleeding condition I have. easy to wash
4,Kevlar knit sleeves,"The Kevlar sleeves are excellent for all types of manual work. Working in the garden to protect hands and lower arms. Working on your car prevents those scrapes, and cuts plus oil covering everything. Washable and reuseable"
2,Picky and noisy,"This drive would have been perfect if not for it being picky when it comes to media. When playing dvds, its so loud, it overpowers the noise in my cpu. Its distracting.The only good thing about this drive is that its cheap. But that is all you can get. Its a cheap writer which is cheaply constructed. I guess I got what I paid for. for others looking to buy this thing, spend just a little more on better known brands in dvd writers. Yes, Pioneer are famous but not when it comes to writers. There are others out there worth considering. But for the price no writer beats it except mayber for the ""ultra-cheap all the way"" NEC.Other writers worth mentioning are Plextor and TDK which are admittedly more expensive than the Pioneers."
1,DOA,This is my second unit replaced by J&R but still cannot get it to work. I starting to think there is bug in this batched or units but It could just be my luck.
2,Loss Distributions,"This book, part of the Wiley Series in Probability and Mathematical Statistics is writen for the fitting of probability distribution models to data relating to losses in the insurance industry. A necessary prerequisite for the understanding of this book is a university course in mathematical statistics. This is an advanced book utilizing higher mathematical formulas and functions. It covers models for random variables, statistical inference, loss distributions, and applications. It is a very useful book for those interested in theory and who are competent in advanced functions."
4,Great vest,I bought this so when I train I would have the extra pounds on. This vest works great and the price is great too. The adjustable weights make it great for anyone to use. The fit is tight and is great to run in.
5,Great vest,"This is a great vest, it fits very snug! The only complaint that I have is when I bend over to stretch my legs, the vest tends to come out of the straps. This could be fixed with a little more Velcro on the straps. As I am a thin man, the straps are tightened so much the strap Velcro ends up towards the right side of my body, this leaves the left side open to this problem. Other than that, which can be simply fixed this vest is great, quality is good, tight fitting, adjustable and reasonably priced."
3,TKO 244wv 40-pound Weignted Vest,"Vest and weights are great, however product arrived saturated in oil. I e-mailed photos to manufacturer who took nearly two weeks to respond. By then I laundered vest and hand-washed weights at my own risk. Amazon offered to exchange vest but it was back-ordered."
1,Poorly Sewn !,"Just received the weigh vest today, couple of times putting it on for testing, hell no ! the velcro stitching is ripping off, quality of workmanship, FAILED ! Stationed overseas, I'm just going to make the best of it, till it falls apart. Doesn't deserve a star at all, expecting a heavy weight vest like this needed heavy duty stitching. Again deceived by all these positive reviews."
5,Very good product,This vest is really good. It fits snug and has little movement. I like to use it when I walk in the hills and it makes for a great workout.
2,Unexpected disappointment,"I really tried to get into this book, but I couldn't seem to follow the characters at all. The hero and heroine didn't come across like they really loved each other. I wished their could have been more involvement or romance between the couple."
1,upset,both lipsticks were on back order. i never received either one. please let me know how i can do a survey about 2 items that i never received.
4,"If you want a fender amp, BUY ONE","I can't let the dude below be the only review for this amazing amp. The cleans are dark and midsy, which I love (as do the mars volta and led zeplin) and the dirty channel makes you feel like a rock star. period. BUY THIS AMP!!!"
1,very dangerous,"I purchased this stool not even two weeks ago, was in shower and sat down. I am an average size female, and screws seperated from base where teak is attached to legs and made legs fall off, sent me flying into my tile wall and broke out tiles with my head and body. Spent afternoon in emergency room. This product is not safe, maker of product should recall."
2,Teak Slats too lightweight,I leaned forward and broke one of the thin slats. The seat is useless now and unsafe. I would recommend looking for a teak seat with fewer slats that are thicker.
1,MOLD,Beware of mold on this one. I'm on here now looking into other alternative types. We purchased this stool a while ago and have had trouble with mold since. Today I put it in the trash. Problem solved.
1,"Boring, Dull, Lame, Stupid","Playboy DVDs in general leave me quite unsatisfied. There are a couple of exceptions, the first Girlfriends DVD and More Sexy Girls Next Door are both very erotic and have some great scenes. I was hoping that this DVD would be more like the More Sexy Girls Next Door DVD but boy was I wrong. First of, this DVD is very tame. There is really very little decent nudity in it, and what nudity there is would easily be classified as PG-13. Second, there is way too much yacking and not enough fondling (if you know what I mean). And third, many of the scense are actually repeated throughout the DVD. My advice is to save your money and avoid this DVD at all cost. If you really want to invest in a good soft core adult DVD, check out some of the older Penthouse titles like Dear Diary, Internet Babes, or either of the two Pets In Paradise DVDs."
5,A definite must buy.,"This is not like most Playboy DVD's, this is high quality and VERY hot stuff. The women are natural beauties and the film is not shy about showing off their wonderful assets, leaving nothing to the imagination. Best Playboy production I have seen...ever!"
2,Bunch of Skanks,"Not worth it at all...although I did buy this as a joke for my wife who likes the ""Girls Next Door"" Series."
4,"If you liked ""Far Journeys"" you'll like Moen's books","A fascinating story of writer Bruce Moen's experiences with the programs at the Monroe Institute and his travels in the various ""Focus Levels"" as defined by Monroe. Much like Monroe's ""Far Journeys""."
5,Dixie Carter's Unworkout VHS,"This is a great video for anyone who wants a good, enjoyable workout. She is precise & easy to listen to. She does not hurry thru instructions & gives encouragement thruout the workout. It was nice to find a mature woman I could relate to."
4,Dixie's workout,"The product arrived in a timely manner and was certainly priced right. I was a little worried about the video quality due to age. It is not quite as clear as a new one would be, but I have wanted this for some time and was glad to find it."
3,Moonlighting season 4,"The whole Moonlighting series is worth owning. Season 4 is ultimately weaker than seasons 1-3, but still very enjoyable.Moonlighting - Seasons 1 & 2"
3,miss this season,"With pain in my heart i can't give to this season more then three stars. This season really don't goes in line with previous three ones.I was so exited when i bought it, but then came disappointment. The fact that Mady is pregnant and apart from David - and they stay away from each other almost all season. Mady lives with her parents and thinks all the time about life.David wanna get to her but by mistake he placed in jail where he spends minimum 1 from 3 dvd's of season. I really couldn't watch that moments and went to next chapter where was at least some bright moments of season, but there was not much of then (unfortunately).Seems last 5th season is better then this one and i definitely will buy it for collection."
1,Very Dissapointing,This season of Moonlighting was extremely disapointing. The writers took the story in a direction reminisent of a soap oppera. It lacked the fun interaction between the charicters and had very few cases to add freshness to the story line. I am planning on reselling my copy because it is not even worth watching a second time.
3,moonlighting #4,"I love the series but found this DVD set disappointing due to quirks. Not all episodes are listed separately on the disc so you must choose Play All and fast forward to get to certain episodes. When you do that you also miss any commentary that may accompany the episode. The series itself is still a lot of fun, I just wish the Lionsgate people would fix the tech problems. I had the same problem with Season 3."
3,"Not the best season, but essential for fans","So good to have ""Moonlighting"" available on dvd! I actually found season one to be weaker than I remembered, and this season four set to be much better. There are some great episodes, and a few Bruce Willis only clunkers. The real downside to this set is the dvd commentaries. For the first episode, ""A Trip to the Moon,"" Bruce Willis and Glen Gordon Caron come off as the two biggest a-holes in the world, trashing the episode. Caron talks about how he wasn't present, and both do everything but say they hated Cybill Shepherd. Just from listening to these two self-proclaimed talents, you can imagine what a nightmare it must have been for Cybill working with them. Ugh! Watch the shows, and leave the commentaries for people who aren't fans of ""Moonlighting."" Hopefully when season five comes along on dvd, Bruce and Glen will be too busy with their brilliant careers to lend further commentaries!"
2,The weakest link,Firstly I want to say I loved Moonlighting from day one. But by the time this 4th season aired things began to slide big time. Having purchased seasons 1-3 and thoroughly enjoying them I purchased season 4 expecting to be disappointed and was.This is painful to watch at times and I found that the best bits came courtesy of Herbert and Agnes. The relationship problems between Maddie and David became tiresome and the way it was played out was horrendous. Cybill Shepherd has made it clear she was not happy about Maddie's completely stupid behaviour and Bruce Willis seems visibly bored to be there at times.I'm looking forward to season 5 as I remember several great episodes such as 'Plastic Fantastic Lovers' 'Shirts and Skins' and 'I See England.....'
5,fun and full of laughs,They dont make tv shows like this any more full of suspense yet funny and the whole family can watch
1,Menu on disks is wrong,"Love the show, but the menu on disks two through four only shows the first two episodes on the disk. We tried ""play all"" and found that the missing episodes are there. You have to forward through two episodes to get to number three. What a pain. I think they ought to refund or replace."
3,moonlighting review,"these season of moonlighting is ok it isnt one of the best, but it is still good and entertaining to watch."
3,I'd rather re-watch previous episodes,"As a big fan of this series I can remmember how the frustration from constant repeats in Season 3 turned even worse the following year when most of the new episodes only included one(or none)of the main stars. As good as Miss Depesto and Mr. Viola were, they were never meant to carry a whole episode by themeselves.These are the reasons why I'm passing on Season 4. Personally I'd rather re-watch the episodes on the previous seasons and remmember Moonlighting at its best."
5,Great for vivid dreams,"I purchased these after reading somewhere that not only do they help retain memory during the day, but can help increase dream retention.I take one 4 hours before my normal wake time and have intense, vivid dreams that are easy to remember.On another note, it is a flavorless capsule that is easy to swallow."
4,Kinda Works,I have better memory of my dreams when using it.It is tough to sleep after taking the pill.I usually take it after 3-4 hours of sleep and try to fall back to sleep . It takes me 1 hour to fall back to sleep.I only use it once a week for lucid dreaming. No OBE ore lucid dreams. I just seem to remember my dreams more when using it.
2,Didn't work,I've tried it several times and I was never able to achieve a lucid dream. I also tried taking up to 3 at a time and I still was unable to.
3,mixture of excellent and some just along for the ride,"There are some great tracks on this album, namely ""let's throw some mud at the wall"", and the first two tracks are better than decent. But the rest of the album is pretty lackluster and repetative. I recommend downloading just the three good tracks if you can."
2,ASP.NET 1.1 with a bit of 2.0 patched on,"Much of the content was clearly taken from earlier 1.x versions of the book without being re-written to take advantage of 2.0. Yes, the samples may compile and work, but they are often not 2.0 best practices.While there are several 2.0-specific sections, much 2.0 function is ignored. You'll learn more from other books."
1,What a joke!,"Curt Mitchel can wail... but he doesnt play things right! I've seen Metallica live... I've got their tab book. A few things aren't right. Seek n Destroy isnt played right. The guy messes up a lot also. Can't see finger movements clearly, effects on parts that make the sounds completly blend... but not in a good way."
5,Curt knows how to play them,Gets right into the main riffs. Although I don't agree on them all they are pretty close and sound cool. The only negative thing is the accompaning paper work is really tiny and some of it didnt come thru on the print.
4,"Capitalizm is here to stay, Democracy is for those who can pay.","""Offical Knowledge"" is an incredible book which serves many purposes in the curriculum debate. Teachers who are feeling frustrated at the burgeoning, trivial official standards being dictated by State and Federal Government mandates will take heart to know that they are not alone. Teachers are trained for years to facilitate learning in their classrooms, but official knowledge is becoming a script. The only way for a new teacher to survive is to march lock-step to the dictates of agencies which are driven by political expediency. The capitalist masses (mob) are not interested in providing a relevant education to all children regardless of race, creed, national origin or socio-economic status. Unfortunately, this capitalist way thinking is so entrenched in U.S. society, and the symbolic solutions which Apple offers will never be adopted by the mob."
4,An enjoyable read...,"Having recently returned to the fantasy genre, and with some familiarity of the Warhammer universe, I enjoyed this offering by Brian Craig and the Black Library. The story is interesting enough to qualify as a page turner, but most of all the dialogue is well written. I found myself chuckling at many of the characaters' words and actions, so as a work of ""fluff"" it hits the mark."
3,Not horrible,"I really wanted to like this book...however the writing style is somewhat stiff and the story never really seems to get going. It's not horrible, but for Warhammer 40K fantasy, I enjoyed Jonathan Green's The Dead and the Damned much more"
1,Try other Warhammer Novels,"Sorry to say this was easy to put down...and I really enjoy Warhammer novels. The characters where uninteresting, the story line boring, I didn't even like the style of the tale. I've read most of newer stuff, love Gotrek and Felix, the Vampire novels, authors Nathan Long, C.L. Werner...just about any of the Omnibus books have been well worth it. I think I've only put down two novels from the Black Library and this is one of them."
1,"share the same question,like a fan fron Williamsburg, Virgin","a I brought this box set in singapore in 1997.6 CDinside, the set includes private demos,live recording from""the arthur godfrey show""and""the grand ole opry"" Also includes a 88 pages hardcover, rare photos.discography by Richare Weize.Songs likes,A rose and a Baby Ruth,Abilene,You are my Sunshine,china Doll.I want to collect all GH songs.Still looking for songs like ""Time"" a ""four Strong Winds"".Amazon,please include all the titles of songs .I will buy it if this another different box set"
5,Great Buy!,I LOVE THIS BOOK!!! Myles is a powerful teacher. This book was a major contributor to my journey! Great Buy!
3,"Started off good, but then.....",The idea that we all have a purpose is so true and the book started off well. I just found it to be too much of the same thing chapter after chapter and actually had a hard time finishing the book. What started out as an exciting read left me more than disappointed. Somehow I think it went off course for me about a third of the way in.
2,Appetite suppressant not so much,"Doesn't work as well as the Slim Form Hoodia SP. Normally, I would take the Slim Form once a day and that was it. However, with the Maximze version I have to take it at least 2x a day."
4,Heart & Soul,"While many blues artist are usually grouped together strictly as blues, this need not apply to the music of Larry Wimmer. While his songs such as ""Burnin Up"" & ""Love Mansion"" may fit the genre, one needs to go deeper into the tracks & listen to ""Kissed by an Angel"" & ""Theres a Light"". These songs show his ability to go outside the Blues usual avenues. They touch a deeper personal soulful sound that he seems to draw on from his life expierences and yet the listener can relate the songs to themselves in an easy and appreciative fashion. I am looking forward to more releases from Mr. Wimmer as his future appears to be kissed by blues Heaven"
5,Chocolate Genius is Splendid in Splendor,"If this CD had only Chocolate Genius doing ""Ain't that peculiar"" as the only song, it would be worth the price. However, it has much more, with an excellent selection of interesting and diverse songs. Also, those who question whether Harvey Pekar approved of the songs on this CD need only examine the liner notes that come with the CD. He has only positive things to say about it."
3,Where Is My American Splendor? No title song?!,"I agree with these other reviews. The music on this CD is fine as far as it goes, but the decision not to include the title song by Eytan Mirsky is extremely hard to understand since this piece of music is unique to the film and it's a great tune!"
1,Hey! Something's missing . . .,"I was all set to get my American Splendor soundtrack after seeing the film. The tracks jazz and blues tracks all hit the mark in the film, and the brief, brief, brief appearance by Eytan Mirsky performing the title song was truly a bonus moment. It would be so great to have disc with the full-length versions of those songs on it. Wouldn't it? Do the producers of the disc know where I can find one?I'm not a film or music professional, but aren't title songs supposed to be on soundtracks? Think Shaft, think Superfly, think Tao of Steve . . . sheesh!"
1,Needs More Pop,I've just increased my Jazz CD collection from zero to one in acquiring this CD. Guess I can't compete with Harvey's collection of jazz sides. But I can't understand how come Eytan Mirsky's title song was left off the soundtrack. Was it something he said?
4,the Blue and Green issue,"No it was not blue and green playing. It sure did sound like it but it didn't have the break that leads to the bridge.The movie was great and I enjoy the music (especially Rupert Holmes and the blues standards). ""My favorite things"" at the end was a bit too much, though."
2,What Happened to Eytan?,"I would have to say that I loved the movie more than the soundtrack but have to ask . . . . WHERE IS EYTAN?The missing ingredient in the soundtrack for American Splendor is obviously the song . . . . AMERICAN SPLENDOR !!! How could a soundtrack for a movie not include the title movie song? This is clearly a huge mistake because the artist Eytan Mirsky, (who is actually featured in the movie) is AMAZING !!!If you missed him on the soundtrack you can catch him at MAKOR in NYC on 9/16 at 10PM where he will play his song . . . AMERICAN SPLENDOR !!"
3,If you're looking for the title song,"Many people have written to me asking how to get the title song of the film, which is not on the soundtrack album. If anyone reading this would like to get a copy of the entire song (as it appears on the DVD), just purchase one of my albums from the $10 amazon.com marketplace listings (see ""Used and new from $10""), and e-mail me at eytanmirsky@hotmail.com. I will throw in the ""American Splendor"" song for free."
4,Great Music ... But where is the title track?,"I liked listening to Jay McShann and Mark Suozzo, but I really wanted to hear to American Splendor by Eytan Mirsky (so did my son - he chipped in $7 for this, his 1st CD, because he liked the song so much - now I'll have to buy the DVD so we can listen to American Splendor). Anyway, I wish I had read Yayoay's review so at least I would have known what was missing. Enough with my whining, I really wanted to listen to Jay McShann too and I wasn't disappointed with that. Great jazz...."
2,I am upset,"When Eytan Mirsky played the title track I turned to my wife and said when we get home I'm ordering this CD from Amazon.com.....when I found out the title track(American Splendor) was omitted from the soundtrack I couldn't believe it!!! The other music is cool...especially the blues version of ""Aint that Peculiar"" but it was not good enough for me to buy the CD. This was a poor marketing decision by someone."
1,Bad Investment.,"I feel that I overpaid for this item. I could have found it at Duane Read drugstore for half the price that I paid for it. In addition, one of the screw was missing and it requires a great deal of effort to assemble it together."
4,Great Struts Cheap,Exactly as described. Works well. Great OEM replacements. Take your old strut to a suspension garage to have them compress the springs! Will save lots of time and effort!
5,"Clear, concise, very useful and fun to read","This book addresses the questions that I think all parents face. We want our children to be able to think, feel, achieve and have good relationships. This book is also the first to tell us how we can help kids make good decisions and get along with other children and adults. It provides many useful examples and its use of humor makes it fun to read."
3,creatures...,"this was not one of my favorite urusei yatsura novels. it was still as funny as the others, but all the new characters kinda confused me. the one thing i really must warn you of in this book is ten and ran. they are so confusing. i did not quite understand ran's role in this book anyways. she's just sort of there and she's constantly happy contrary to ""sweet revenge"". ten is also very odd in that he seems a lot less intelligent in this book than in the last one. other than this, the book is very funny and if you enjoy the rest of urusei yatsura, than you will like this one. love ya all---^.^ ciao!!!"
2,You Get What You Pay For,"I bought a few of these last summer. They were only $10, so I thought it was a great deal. They did work like they were supposed to for a while, then one day I come home and find that water did not shutoff. Well, it had only been five hours, so it was not too bad, but it could have been a lot worse. I did try another low end timer, with similar results. So, save money up front and plan on spending $30-$40 for a decent timer that will not cost you a big water bill."
1,Easily breakable!,"I would not buy this product unless you can be very careful not to pull on the hose very hard. With just a little force, the black plastic piece will break at the neck just above the threaded female connector.On the upside, my second one-with careful usage-lasted through one whole season and still functioned until I left it with water inside during a freeze. The plastic broke then too. I tried to obtain replacement parts (the lower part of the green cover comes off easily to reveal the replacable plastic piece) but the company told me this was not possible. Now I have two perfectly functional timers that might be usable in some other way?"
1,wrong!!,"This was the most horrible experience. First the charger is not even the one that i need it. Then when i try to correct the issue with the company they insisted that they have the right one, I asked if they can send a picture to make sure that this time will be the right one; and again was a different one. So I wouldn't buy from this company ever again."
3,FAIR,"I bought it to replace the stand I had, which fell apart. But had use my dremel tool sander to reshape the stub which goes in the bottom of the brush because it is a different shape than the original."
2,5 page story packed into 200 pages,"I am very seldom critical of the books that I read because I can appreciate how hard it is to write a good historical book. However, I was really disappointed with this book. The story is told more like a chronology that seems to have been converted from a list or bullet points. Little background is provided. Names pop up from time to time without any explanation of who they are. If a reader is not familiar with the relevant background history, these names will prove absolutely meaningless.I bought the book because I wanted to know about Washington's transition from officer to civilian, but there is almost nothing in the book about that except the repeated statement that he made such a transition. Instead, the pages are filled with a day-by-day account of Washington eating dinner and dancing with girls in towns along the route back to Mt. Vernon.One reviewer said not to be put off by the cheesy title of this book. I wish I had been."
1,More voice work was needed to match her songwriting ........,"Soraya was a good songwriter, but not a very good singer. Her voice had a nice tone, and sounded good when she sang softly, as on the song ""Suddenly"" from her first album. But on this album she tried to do more with her voice than it was capable of. There was a very weak area between her chest voice and her head voice, and she had developed an irritating yodel when switching between them, which production on her first album had adequately disguised. But on this album it is constantly front and center.She was beautiful on the outside, and beautiful on the inside, as her songwriting attests. Her singing was a work in progress. Her voice needed much more work, and we'll never know if it would have made the grade. Ultimately it doesn't matter. Her beauty and humanity live on."
3,Worth the price.,Excellent product for the price. The DVD provides an adequate workout and it comes with the stretchie.One thing I didn't like was the inability to pause the DVD as it stated this action is not allowed.
4,Very detailed history of the Elite,Skull And Bones:The secret society imported from Germany. People like George Bush and his son George W. Bush were members of this Yale elitist club. When questioned on their membership they either wont comment (senior Bush) or they chuckle and question whether it is still in existence. Why don't they want to address this club? Could they be hiding something? They were in fact members! Read the book and you will know the secrets these and other men would prefer you not know!
4,An Uncensored Examination of The Skull & Bones Order,"Antony Sutton, rogue historian, has done a nice job examining the history, motives, and methods of the Skull & Bones Order. The Hegelian dialectic is seen as a chief method of their manipulation of society, and the presence of Skull members G.W. Bush & John Kerry on opposite sides of the 2004 election campaign would seem to support this contention. Sutton was apparently supplied with documentation of Order membership and some other aspects of Skull & Bones history. Some of his ideas are speculative, though it is clear that Sutton looks for the most logical explanation, no matter how unpleasant or politically incorrect that conclusion may be. Sutton died in the year this latest (2002) edition was published, and he has left a legacy of books that document the presence of establishment elite conspiratorial activity. This is an excellent book for those seeking a meaningful understanding of history and current events."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,"This is the type of book that I have interest in reading but this one in particular was really bad. Trying to establish a connection between the order and Germany is all that this book tries to do. It has some reprinted documents that are very boring to read and its memorandum format kills the interest of any reader. Maybe the only memorandum that is worth reading is the one that talks about education. I wanted to find out more about the media control, banks, etc. and there's nothing. The true meaning of this order remains a mistery. Complete waste of money."
3,Hard to Read but Informative,"This book tends to get boring as it is written for very high brown readers. If this author had been able to break it down for the average American to read, he would have had a more powerful text to share."
5,FAVORITE ROCKABYE BABY CD,Seriously awesome. Our baby loves All of the Rockabye Baby cds. This one is our favorite as we love every track!
5,This Game Is Great!,"Aero the Acrobat, the classic Sunsoft game for Super NES, comes to Game Boy Advance! Edgar Ektor (and evil ex-circus clown) has booby-trapped the circus with the help of a crazy flying squirrel named Zero and his fairground henchmen. Only Aero, a master of acrobatics, can diffuse the dangers of the circus and perform various death defying acts to amuse the unsuspecting audience. As the headlining act, Aero will walk tightropes, swing on trapezes, blast out of cannons and plunge off the high dive in order to find Ektor and put a stop to his evil plans.Great graphics and action-puzzle elements garnered Aero the Acrobat great reviews when it was first released in 1993. Now you can re-live the classic on Game Boy Advance.Aero the Acrobat is slated to wing his way to GBA..."
3,Brush works great but...,"the silver tip comes apart from the handle which is annoying. Otherwise, it would have received 5 stars.I am switching all my cosmetics to Larenim and I am so happy with everything I've received. These are great, natural products. Highly recommend!"
4,Can you say Character?,"This is a smaller, but complete Kanji (or Japanese Character) dictionary. I used it to teach my 9th grade Japanes Language class and they found it very helpful. It is organized well and after some practice, they were able to look up new characters with ease."
1,PRAXIS/CST Technology Education (Industrial Arts) (National Teacher Examination Series),"PRAXIS/CST Technology Education (Industrial Arts) (National Teacher Examination Series) ....Don't bother ordering this book if you think you need it for New Jersey's Technology Education Praxis exam.I just took the brand new 2012 Technology Education Praxis exam today (Jan. 14, 2012), and it is totally revised and nothing like the old Industrial Art/ Technology Exam.They took just about all construction, electrical, carpentry etc off the exam and it is now heavily loaded with current technology systems and teaching technology strategies.Two things to study for the new test:Standards for Technological LiteracyContent for the Study of Technology (free online)Exploring Design, Technology & Engineering (about $70 from Amazon or Barnes & Noble.Good Luck!"
2,"Somewhat Helpful, but outdated","Much of the contents of this book must of been written at least 20 years ago. The pages are written with the use of a typewriter, and many of the references used didn't pertain to living in the 21st century. An example is a question that asks the tester to descripe an Opaque Projector. I don't even know of a school that still uses this. I mean it is possible, but for someone to go into the teaching field, one would like to use the most cutting edge technology availible. Same again for defining Film Strips. Yes, they are cool, but... well maybe I am just very fortunate to be in a school district that uses powerpoint, and laptop type projectors.If I had to do it again, would I buy this book? yes. Because I can't find another book that practices the industrial TECHNOLOGY for praxis II.It is better than nothing."
1,A waste of money and time.,"This book is a waste of your money and time in so many ways. First and foremost the contents relate to when this Praxis exam was for Industrial Arts, not Industrial Technology; so the content is invalid. Study guide? The answers are provided, however there is no commentary or explaination of the questions and asnwers at all. Finally, I found 2 typos that changed the meaning completely."
3,Not as good as the first two books,"More great stories by Jean Shepherd. Some were retold again, but they are still very funny and enjoyable."
2,brady bunch dolls,I was disappointed when I received the dolls. I bought them for a gift .....Mrs Brady comes with gray plastic hair (the other dolls have real hair)..... Marcia face looks bad her teeth stick out ......... I am not going to give them out as a gift
4,Shocked and Thrilled...,"I came across this book and snatched it up right away. I've always been a huge fan of Madsen's and never knew he wrote. When I picked this up and started reading it I couldn't believe this was the same man we all know from the movies! This is just beautifuly written poetry that few have matched in our day and age, let alone an actor. I would say he should be listed as a writer, then an actor... and that's saying a lot because I LOVE his acting. Go get this book now!!!"
1,Critique of the critics of the critics,"Putting aside all of the ad hominem attacks--I never got beat up by a Michael Madsen tough guy in grade school, nor do I write poetry in iambic pentameter, nor do I consider myself an intellectual or pseudo-intellectual--you guys are just plain wrong. Madsen's writing is awful. Sometimes it takes more GUTS to acknowledge that a completed work belongs in your sock drawer and not in the bookstore.If indeed Madsen's book is found in the hands of ""people in the gutter,"" then there must not be very many ""people in the gutter."" As of today, his book ranks 881,837 in sales, just ahead of ""Tenant-in-common ownership expands 1031 exchange opportunities.Most authors aren't trying to win the Pulitzer either. But millions of people read some of those authors. There's a reason why no one is reading Madsen. I assume you can figure it out."
1,Very disappointed!,"I love Michael Madsen, but except for maybe 1 poem, this book was terrible. I am not a big poetry lover, however I have 2 friends that love both poetry & M.M. & they didn't like it either! I couldn't give it away, I begged both of them to take it for their own collections, but they snorted and gave it back me quickly! The few poems that actually seemed to mean something were quite depressing & made him seem very lonely. I would advise you not to buy this book, or to get a cheap, used copy first! Mine is still looking for a good home! =)"
3,dark and interesting,"his peotry definately walks on the shady path, skirting around an essence that is close to Keroac.I enjoy his short tales of rough housing and other tales of life. One thing about it, is it doesn't seem contrived, or fake, which is a good thing for me. But there are other aspects of this book , i can't put my finger on it, that seems odd, or not connecting."
2,Does not appear to be accurate,"Shows about 4 degrees warmer than other thermometers in the house.Our thermostat, tube thermometer and a different digital thermometer all read the same when placed in the same area. If I put this thermometer next to them it reads about 4 degrees warmer. Inside the package it says sender is responsible for shipping charges if returning the unit under warranty.Update: December 30, 2011I got a replacement unit through Amazon shortly after writing my first review. The replacement unit reads the same as my other thermometers and has been working perfectly ever since. First unit was just a lemon. So I'm bumping my review up to 4 stars."
4,Great Hygro-Thermometer,The size of the display is very functional. Very simple operation but does the job. This is my first Hygro-Thermometer and I like it a lot. I would recommend this for anyone looking for a simple temperature/humidity gauge.
1,The Extech 445703,"One of my better speculative purchases, it looks good and works fine. Checked for accuracy against a much more expensive instrument, it was about right on. What more can one say."
1,Big Digit Hygro-Thermometer #445703,"LCD screen went black between 130-135 degrees F, rating is to 140 degrees F. Was using it inside of greenhouse."
3,Works All Right,"This comb works all right. I like the spacing of the tines, and the handle is comfortable. As to its anti-static properties, I can't say I was impressed. We were having a very cold snap, so we were running the heat a lot and the whole house was filled with static. We were getting shocked whenever we touched each other or anything for that matter, and our hair was standing out when we would comb it, etc. I was hoping this would help when combing my long haired Persian, so his coat would lay flat but it didn't make any difference. I even used it with an anti-static spray-on coat conditioner, but no change. Still, all in all, a decent pet comb with a good handle."
3,HIGH FLOW SHOWERHEAD,Don't buy this item unless you plan to remove the white flow constrictor...it clearly was not designed as a low-flow showerhead.
1,Ha!,"Little kids everywear! Buy Cardcaptor Sakura Comic Book! It has more pictures and more HUMOR! If you really like Cardcaptors, then buy Cardcaptor Sakura on DVD or Video! Kero doesn't sound like a BUS DRIVER! just stay away from Cardcaptors! IT'S EEEEEEEEVIL!"
1,Poorly conceived and useless,This book has nothing to ofer. If you need some pointers on creating XSL style sheets then keep looking. There is no one practical example even for basic stuff like using variable and parameters for sorting and filtering. Most examples are of the form:xsl:choosexsl:when test='expr1' somethingso if you whant to know how to build 'expr1' you need another book.After spending the money and time I had to go to the www.w3c.org site and obtain the information.
3,use with caution,"Valuable introduction to onscreen XML/XSLT development for beginners. Gives _some_ idea about building an XML-based Web site. I'd recommend using this book together with other sources.However, emphasis on tree diagrams may be confusing when XML content is kept in relational database. Also, application developers will not find any suggestions on using XML in application code."
1,TERRIBLE!!,"My rear view mirror fell off about a year ago, so I bought this adhesive to fix it. The first time, it worked until the winter when my mirror fell off again. I stupidly bought the same adhesive again, and there wasn't any glue in the pouch provided. DON'T BUY THIS GLUE!! IT IS A WASTE OF MONEY! Even if it only costs a couple of bucks."
3,A little Disappointed,"When I fist heard about the Dead Sea Scrolls, I was under the impression that the contained stories about Jesus.This is not true. It's basically an add on of the Old Testament.On top of that, it's literally bits and pieces of stories that I guess were all that could be salvaged.The only ""plus"" is that this version includes translation help from the author so that you can at least attempt to figure out what the stories are talking about because without it, they would make no sense whatsoever. But then again, these are translations, and can be influenced by what the authors believe. All in all I don't recommend this book if you are trying to find out any ""unknown"" information about Jesus, or really anything in general.Good if you want more info from the Old Testament I guess."
4,the best version of the DSS I could find,I first saw this version of the Dead Sea Scrolls while actually seeing them in Philadelphia. It was in the little store where you buy all things dead sea scrolls related. It is the best translation of the scrolls I saw. Very happy with it
2,BIASED,"The Dead Sea Scrolls, A New Translation leaves much to be desired. This translation APPEARS to be the work of three authors who sat down together and envisioned how they could make it more palatable.It is very slanted from a Christian viewpoint. If you are a serious student looking for answers, forget this book. You might as well go down to any neighborhood church and get a pastors conclusion on the Dead Sea Scrolls. They would probably be quite similar.This is not what I consider scholarly work. Scholarly work would consist of unbiased, unslanted views that don't fill in the blanks with New Testament writing, when and where it is convenient. There are excellent translations out there---take time to search for a good one; unless you like reading Dead Sea Scroll material just for pleasure!"
5,"Very good, easy to read!","This is a must for anyone who wants a complete version of the Dead Sea Scrolls. The edition is very easy to read, the text is of a good size and the paper is nice. The book also lays flat which to me was important. Over all I would highly recommend this to anyone's library. The books are very interesting, but do not really have any kind of odering, most were written to stand on their own. It's a pretty large book so it is not something you can read in one sitting. It is one of those books you use as a continual reference."
4,Another hit for teens,"Tim LaHaye does it again! Not only a great teacher, propehecy expert, riveting author of the Left Behind series, but also able to relate to the teenage population with this story of things that could be faced in today's society, with strong Christian characters."
4,Very Helpful -even for an experienced trainer/presenter !,"I picked up this book on vacation. It reads well with a format more like a ""how-to"" book. I found that, even though I am a professional trainer and consultant with ""many"" years of public presentations to parents, educators and administrators under my belt, Mr. Gelb's suggestions for improving my skills have been very helpful, easy to implement and effective.. I have recommended this book to our CEO for all our consultants. I have used mind-mapping for all my presentations and projects... can't sing the praises loudly enough!"
5,This book is awesome and I refer to it often,"This book is great! If you want to become a better presenter of any kind, read this. It will help you organize your talks more quickly and in a manner that helps the presentation to stick. It also teaches one how to be more relaxed. This book has definitely helped me be a better presenter and be more confident and I re-read it every so often. It's a quicky."
2,Like a Marshmallow - Light and Fluffy,This is more about mind mapping than presenting. I have used mind mapping for years - and it's very useful. It's really not so complex that anyone needs to make a career of it. Is this book really intended as a way to create back-end business for the author?
2,Cheap for the price,"While it is extremely functional and worked well for our party, it is rather cheaply made for the price I paid. I think I could have cobbled something together that would have looked almost as nice for a fraction of the price."
4,Plenty of Pictures,"I have a whole library of decorating books, and this is one I'm going to hang on to for a while. It's not fantastic, but it is full of beautiful rooms with good ideas."
2,relaxing at bedtime,"I actually thought I was purchasing tea bags not crystals, but I enjoy the taste and the relaxing feeling it gives me at bedtime."
3,Just Average,"The tea arrived quickly, and is OK. However, there is a faint taste of dirt. I have been drinking this type of tea for about ten years and never had that taste. Would not buy it again."
5,Good book for understanding OSPF inside and out,"Full content of book is dedicated to explaining OSPF from design to troubleshooting. I found this a good source for preparing for the CCIE Written Examination. Also recommend Routing TCP/IP, author: Jeff Doyle, for the truly dedicated IP professionals looking beyond passing tests ""Internetworking TCP/IP"" author: Douglas Comer"
3,No Editing was done on this book!,"Cisco never has an editor for any of its books. There is no way ther was a proofreader for this text. There is a typo, contradiction, or grammar error every few pages. Other than that, the book is pretty comprehensive. It covers both theory and applications."
3,"It's a good 10,000 foot view book but lacks meat at times","I revisited this book the other day. It's not bad, but it doesn't have any concrete examples that can help set the concepts in concrete. Originally, I had a scathing review, but after reviewing the book again, I might have over reacted."
3,Sam Halabi's Design Guide Brought Up to Date !,"A well laid out book that takes the reader through OSPF. This book is not the ""definative"" OSPF guide, as the book is not detailed enough to warrant this recognision. It does not address some of the ""querky"" OSPF design issues.The book focuses on Sam Halabi's Design Guide that is still the most informative document produced on OSPF configuration guidelines. The author acknowledges this and adds some ""value added"" with the latest Cisco features. Although the book is a hefty 800 pages, the technical content does not justify this.As a text book goes, and not free reference material, this may in fact be the best OSPF book on the market. This reflects the quality and quantity of reference material available for this subject !"
1,Disorganized and confusing,"This book is disorganized and the author's style is confused and contradictory. Leave this one on the shelf and read ""Routing TCP/IP Volume I"" twice."
1,Does not fit models it claims to fit,"I purchased this tail pipe and put it on my 1997 jeep grand cherokee laredo. Walker claims that this will fit that model, year, and car. It does... after having to cut it in half, and bang the hell out of the bracket that holds the rear end of the tailpipe up. Even after all that im still going to have to get another tailpipe to replace it. (I can tell you one thing, it wont be from Walker.) I also purchased a muffler (quiet flow) the muffler works and fits great, its this tailpipe that sucks."
5,Humilac,We use this product all the time. We do Westie Rescue and every Westie goes home with a bottle of it. It does a great job of keeping the skin from drying out no matter how often they must be bathed. It does a great job on human skin also. I use it on face and legs and think it is much better than human skin lotions.
1,Just use the lotion & save your $$$,"Not as good as I would have thought :-(. This spray is very oily which concerns me as to what other products are in there. Also, I have a very short haired dog, but it is still difficult to work the spray into the skin. I use the shampoo and leave in treatment and that's all that is needed. If your dog starts itching again, just save your $$$, mix a little water with the leave in treatment, and that does the trick just fine!"
2,Not so great,"One of the drums doesn't work unless you hit it in the exact spot. Hard for a 12 year old to do, but easy for him to carry anywhere"
3,Not impressed.,"I am a big Emma Holly fan, and an avid reader of paranormal romance. I loved Luisa's story in the FANTASY anthology. That said, I'd have to say that I didn't care much for this book. I think it had too many elements, ans was not nearly long enough to really tackle everything she tried to approach, plot wise. The ""werewolves"" the shape-shifting, the animal bond, the vampirism, the transformation, it really tried to do too much.Plot wise, there were too many bit-players that the reader knew too little about. Istead of concentrating on 2 major players and 2-3 additional minor characters, the author confused us with 2 main characters and 10-15 minor players who occasionally only appeared for a page or two.This book would have been much better if it was longer, and could go into much greater detail about the paranormal elements and the description of the characters, or if it was pared down and distilled to a much simpler story."
