3,to familiar,I think this is just to familiar. its not bad music but its music you've heard before in emo so its realy a downside.i hope they can find there own sound then they;ll be different and better.
3,ok...,if you like generic emo music go ahead and try matchbook romance out but these didnt do it for me
3,Matchbook?,"This band is ok. They have an ok voice and really good drums. MBR is kind of like Taking Back Sunday, but not as cool and tht's good, because I don't like cool bands. Underground is cool. Anyway pick it up if you like fast drums and lyrics that really mean the same thing in every song except for like one song. Over all----Average"
2,lots of better punk/emo bands out there,"generic, unoriginal, boring. not worth buying. don't waste your money on this. download only if you must."
3,Pretty Good,"Alright when I first bought this CD I thought it was amazing. But the more and more I listened to it, it got really old. It starting sounding like everyone else. I like this band a lot, hopefully on the next record they can make a sound that is unique, I really have great expectations for this band, they are pretty talented. I really can't believe all the reviews that said this band was really unique and have their own sound, yeah maybe if this the only band you heard in the last 5 years, but no they diffently don't have an original sound, sorry but its true.Overall a good CD, but if you want something more unique buy something else like the Postal Service - Give Up."
2,"Decent music, mixed horribly","I have listened to this album and not really enjoyed it much. Here are the reasons:1. The mix of the albumIt sounds like the music is in the distance even when you turn it up. Not because of volume, but because there is mo presence there. When you listen to ""The Early November"" you can hear how thick and warm the sound is, but not with this album.2. His voiceEspecially in Tiger Lily. He sounds like he had just eaten a whole bunch of Taco Bell and drank Dr. Pepper to make his voice all gargle sounding. It's really disgusting in some places.The music is decent, but it's just a pain to listen to because the cymbals are all piercing to my ears."
3,Good But Not Good Enough,this cd isnt all cracked up to be. i think their first ep is alot better than this one. i still like it though. it was sweet how they re-recorded the greatest of all time. if you like the first cd by matchbook romance try it out and see if you like it
1,Don't buy this cd-you'll regret it,"Wow, I hope Precious M was joking when she/he said that the lead singer would brag about how he's a ""musical genious"". Musical idiot is more like it.This is a bad cd from a terrible band. All the songs sound alike and run together so much to the point where you're in the middle of a track and think to yourself, ""wait didn't I just hear that song""?! The melodies are also very dull and boring.The singer's voice is downright hideous! A very nasal tone. Plus, he's out of tune.The lyrics aren't horrible but they aren't good either.The best thing about this album is the artwork because it looks like a diary. This album is horrible, though. I regret buying it completely"
1,!!!!!?????,pay almost four times more for one extra song from a band that makes sucky music.. hmmm.. what do you think?
5,I knew they would be good,"I knew these guys had potential. Matchbook Romance originally signed with Drive-Thru records but Drive-Thru records declined them...Matchbook Romance then signed with Epitaph Records and were accepted. Now look who is biting the dust. Drive-Thru records you guys made a stupid, stupid choice. I think they were afraid of something new. Matchbook Romance you guys kick ass. I've listened to the EP for the longest time waiting for this album to come out for the longest time. Finally its out and your really showing the world what you guys got.If your reading my review, stop reading and just click the BUY button and get your copy as soon as possible because your ears are going to be reaching out to listen to this CD because it is freakin amazing.THIS IS WHERE YOU STOP READING AND CLICK ADD TO CART"
1,Really bad,"I've been a software engineer for 20+ years. This is the worst technical book that I can recall. Way too many forward references - ""Now I'll use a technical term that I won't explain for another two chapters"".Most technical books have some forward references but this is ridiculous. To make it worse, some of the terms are never clearly explained even when you get to that section of the book."
1,"A vague introduction, easily beaten by the sketchiest source on the web","The book is written in a very boring English. The author tries to describe everything in text, whereas a simple example would have gone a long way.The examples are scarce inside the text. Well, at least ""good examples"" are... Whenever the author reaches the simple concepts such as parsed entities, he gives a couple of examples, but for more complicated ones such as unparsed, the examples are vague and trivial.The same goes for explaining the attributes: CDATA is explained thoroughly (as in all other resources available on the web), but ID, IDREF, NMTOKEN,... just mentioned in one line, without a single example. I had to spend a lot of time surfing the web to find some clear explanations.You could argue that he was trying to present a brief introduction. Well, that's not exactly true. He tries to touch everything, but in the least clear way possible.There are tons of better books on XML out there. Don't waste your time and money."
2,Learn the basics ?,"The author uses lots of phrases which are explained very quickly, and to vague to be of much use. This is a book for beginners, and you wont come very far reading this book, but you might, perhaps, learn the basics."
4,sheek louch - walk witt me,"sheek louch started as the quiet and not so well-known member of the lox such as his other group member, jadakiss. the streets were callin for a solo after hearing him on various mixtapes and thats what he did. if u like jadakiss & styles p then u will love this. theres so many cuts on here. theres the first single ""mighty d-block (2 gunz up)"", ""ok"" which showcases his raw solo talent. my favorite is ""turn it up"" produced by the alchemist. the album stays in my cd player. worth the money. other hott tracks - ""ten hut"", ""in out"" (feat styles p) theres 2 more but i cant think of the names. ~1~"
2,Sheek must have written the first three reviews himself,"I can't lie, I have only heard the first five cuts off this joint, but I have already retired it. Sheek lacks creativity. Good luck going double plywood with this one troop! That's all. There aint no more. Next ""Gangsta"" please!"
3,The least good rapper from LOX drops the least good solo-album...,"No big surprise, I had bigger hopes... also it's bad that skits aren't on separate tracks so they would be easier to skip...Rating 3.5/5"
5,Sheek Louch - Walk Witt Me,"I've listen to this album for a while now and there's only a one word to describe Sheek's 'Walk Witt Me'. Gangsta. The album is definately for the streets. First track that hits me is 'Turn It Up' with a banger-beat produced by the legendary Alchemist. Sheek's lyrics are on point on this track. Other standout tracks to me are 'I Ain't Forget', 'Walk Witt Me', 'Crazzy', 'How I Love You', '3-5-4 (Tarrentino)', 'Don't Mean Nuthin' and 'Mighty D-Block (2 Gunz Up)', although I liked the original version better. The song called 'OK' could be the second single from the album. But in the end, Sheek Louch keeps it real. 'Walk Witt Me' isn't far away from being a classic, believe me!"
4,trill,yea i like the cd a lot. i like that the fact that he has no skits and he spits straight raw lyrics. D block is in the building
5,Sheek Louch - Walk Witt Me,Walk Witt Me was the best cd that came out this year! sheek louch did a very very very good job writing that cd. That cd is HOT. I love it. Every one up here in NY is bumping that cd. If you dont got it go cop it. NOW. if you dont your missing out BADLY!!!
5,GREAT!!!!,"GREAT SEASON!!!! Seasons 3 and 4 were especially good, with some sad yet good stories. I'm glad they had some episodes where the ""bad guy"" wasn't a ""bad guy"", but was mentally ill.(True Night, season 3, and Normal season 4.) Normal is a REALLY good and sad episode, even though what the guy does is terrible, you feel really bad for him. Actor Mitch Pilegi does a terrific job in his role, that reallyshows the terrible truth that madness has it's reasons.Also has a surprise twist.) Those of you who have seen it, will know what I""m talking about.Chantell"
5,Just keeps getting better,"This show just keeps getting better and better. I don't know how they keep the story's and characters fresh, but they do.Extremely entertaining show.As a side note, we purchased this set from a seller named, ""Hendrob."" This is my second purchase from them, and they are tremendous. Their customer service is un-equaled."
5,"""IT JUST KEEP ON GETTING BETTER""!!!","""Season 4"" is on *FIRE*.IT just keep getting better and better.I can't wait to see season 5.The acting, the characters, the locations andthe story lines are really *HOT*.There are 26 episodes in this season.You really get your money worth.This season is definitly a must see and a must buy.IT'S ON FIREEEE!!!!!"
5,Greaat Sow,This is one of my favorite shows. I an a fan of the characters on the show. I especially love Garcia.
1,Terrible,Waste of money the box was damaged when i received it. The whole purpose of me purchasing the set was to keep it in the box like a collectable.
5,ask me when it arrives,"love to review it , love to see it ,but as it is still making its way to the uk I can't , i think it must be in a boat with a man rowing as it is taking so long, but as i don't want to sound like a moaning brit, and we brits have plenty to moan about, (The pound, Gordon Brown) i will shut up. I am sure when it arrives it will be great, but I am desperate as we missed 2 episodes when we were on holiday in Greece (yes I know i tried to sound hard done by, but we have to get away from UK)"
3,No Subtitles? Are you kidding me??!!,"I'd give a 5 star if this box set has subtitles. What kind of DVDs does not have subtitles these days? My parents can't understand English very well, subtitles would be very helpful so I didn't need to stop every 5 min to explain the plots to them. Please add subtitles for the 5th season box!!!"
3,Criminal production.,"When I started wathching this DVD collection,I was surprised there was not language selection or even caption sistem available.Shame to the producers!!!.How is possible in plain XXI century with millions of foreing people in this country,to produce and sell DVD without language selection and caption sistem available."
3,"Okay, takes time to settle down","With Season fourth starting without Gideon, the season takes some time getting into stride. Also, Rossi takes time to make his screen presence. Overall, just an okay season but lacking in finesse & engrossing episodes which were the hallmark of the previous seasons."
5,review for video,love the episode. One of the best episodes of the series. Very easy to view. streams very well.Would definetly recommend it.
5,love this show,this show is awesome! every episode! whew and ya can't be disappointed when there are super hotties on the show
5,Criminal Minds,It was great! I love the series and I couldn't wait for the next season to come out so I bought the video on demand. I enjoyed it very much.
3,criminal minds - #4,"I attempted to contact the website that I obtained this product from, but have not been able to. I ordered the wrong season of Criminal Minds, and was attempting to get information to return it per the website instructions. I really needed to return the product, so any help I can receive to contact the website would be appreciated."
1,Criminal Minds Season 4 Knockoffs,"I put a review on here but I guess it didn't go through. This season of Criminal Minds seems to be a knockoff. The video and sound quality is poor compared to the other three seasons I have watched. However, the shipping was fast."
3,Criminal Minds season 4,Just once it would be great to see the killer escape the team just once to see them as humanGreat show except for the hollywood endings
5,Grippy and Very Comfortable,"It's neoprene, so it conforms to your shoulder, and has some bounce to smooth out the bumps. It grips your shoulder really well. This is probably the best strap I've ever used."
1,Disjointed facts,"This book is one of the hardest books I have ever read. Toolan describes everything in a train of though manner that would have gotten him a D or lower in any college English class.His facts are semi-indisputable. Our environment is in trouble. It may not be dying, it will probably recover after we are gone, but we are making it an unfavorable place for ourselves to live in.That is the basic message. Unfortunately, Toolan gives this in a disjointed fashion, introducing experts that he gives little to no background for and having them give quotes. Some of his logic is also fuzzy, stating the beginning and the end of a line of thinking, but doesn't say how he got from the problem to the solution, yet we are forced to take his conclusion as fact to finish the passage."
2,coolXterior,"Although the title says .Net ""Applications"", it fails tomention they are ""Web"" applications, meaning ASP.Net & WML Pages! Good thing I got this book from my U's library ratherthan wasting my money on it. I was looking for ""apps"" that runon mobile platforms, not ""apps that run in a IE window""on mobile platforms! Although, it has good descriptionsof resources like the various dev toolkits from different cellphone vendors, there's not much else."
2,ATROCIOUS!,"#1 I have visual studio .net 2003 so don't waste my time telling me about hardcoding templates and device specific stuff before you go to the easier way. Please go into the details of the code AFTER the easier way.#2 The entire chapter on list controls and onwards does NOT make sense and is really hard to understand. I have used j2ee and .net and I should not be having so much trouble understanding your work.#3 please jump into the book rather than why use .net mobile#4 Templates chapter is arduous to read.#5 Openwave sdk 6.2 does not work with examples had to read in chapter 8 that you download updates from MS website before the examples work.#6 don't take till chapter 11 and page 400 to tell me how to connect to the database! don't waste my time with arrays and list controls as ""data collections"" before you get to db connectivity etc. the entire lists chapters could have been written better."
1,Don't Need the Marketing Speak,"To tell the truth, I didn't read the whole book. I was turned off by the market speak right off the bat in chapter one. There's too many other books out there to explore, so please don't waste my time telling me how good .Net technology is; tell me how to use it. If your looking for a good book on Pocket PC programming, check out ""Pocket PC, Handheld PC Developer's Guide with Microsoft Embedded Visual Basic"". There's a lot of good, concise info in that book.As a side note, I'm not a Microsoft basher. I make my bread and butter working with their products. I'm just sick of getting sales pitches everwhere I look."
5,20 years and still works great!,My mother bought this for me over 20 years ago and I still use it for most of my baking and/or mixing needs. I have most of the attachments and they all work great. Thanks to Amazon I found the book to go with it.
3,Repackaging....,"This is just a re-packaging of ""Best Bits of Bean,"" which was originally released on VHS. 5 Stars for Bean, but slightly less for same product, different name. Thus, a combined 3 stars."
5,Mr. Bean's Most Memorable Moments,This man is so funny! I was tired from laughing so hard. What a genius!!! I think I now have all of his DVDs that are available.
2,Not watched yet,I gave it two stars because the package was in good condition and the disc was snapped in place. No visible signs of damage to the disc surface. I will watch it soon.
1,A Fatal Passion is a fatal flop...,"I have at least 100 different books about the Romanovs in my personal library, and I have to say that this is the bottom of the barrel. The writing is trite, the research is flawed, and there are so many inaccuracies that I question this book being called non-fiction. There were so many things Sullivan could have developed in greater depth--especially the relationship between Victoria and her sister. Of course, Ducky was such a shallow individual that I imagine it must have been difficult to write a biography about her. Past reviewers seemed to either love or hate this book. I suspect that the raves came from Sullivan's friends. Any historian familiar with Romanov history will identify this book for what it is--a very flawed attempt to make a minor character in Russian/German/English history into a major one."
1,Royal Pain,"This is the biggest lot of historical nonsense. Sullivan has anirritating style and a gushing attitude towards his subject(either he's related to Ducky or madly in love with her). Hecannot get over how impossibly wonderful, gorgeous, perfect, etche thinks she was. This is a totally inappropriate stance for ahistorian towards a subject. He also trashes everyone Ducky knewto make her look better. Sullivan's treatment of the murderedEmpress Alexandra is particularly cruel and unnecessary. Bottomline: Ducky was an overrated, frumpy, greedy historical footnote.Cyril wanted to be Emperor, so why didn't he start by executingtraitors like himself and his wife? Their behavior was inexcusable, even during a revolution. This book is inexcusableas a history or as a biography. Don't waste your time or money."
1,"""A Fatal Passion"" - Much Ado About Nothing","Although the title suggests otherwise, this is not a particularly insightful or thought-provoking biography. Victoria Melita is portrayed by Michael John Sullivan as neither particularly human or even that interesting, but as a saint victimized by just about every one in her royal family tree: from her grandmother Queen Victoria, to her mother the Duchess of Edinburgh, to Czar Nicholas and Czarina Alexandra, her cousin and sister-in-law, to Ernie, her first husband and cousin, and Kirill, her second husband and cousin. As a biography, it is lopsided and clearly written not to offended Victoria Melita's descendants, and perhaps to further their claim to the Russian throne, as the final sentences of the book suggest. With that in mind, it probably would have made a better historical novel. Michael John Sullivan is a good writer, but a more balanced approach would have made this biography more palatable."
2,Why all of the good reviews?,"I just read ""A Fatal Passion"" and I was very disappointed. The individual the author chose to write about, Princess Ducky, does not merit a biographical account. There are subjects of interest about her life, such as her divorce and her familial relationships with the royal houses of Europe, but beyond that Princess Ducky does not impress me as an a person to admire, nor does her life have a significant impact on 20th European history."
3,A interesting read.,For the most part it was interesting to read about her childhood. I am glad she got a book written about her but it could have had more content. She was a interesting historical figure that deserves more than this book gives her.
2,Clearly Infatuated with his subject,"The author clearly had a fatal passion for his subject- he grounds her into the floor with praises while subjectively pinning down her relatives. I found it unusual how none of ""Ducky's"" faults were mentioned while the author took ever oppertunity to hit down her family members. Clearly, this is a biased biography, however compelling the history itself WAS.And as a previous reviewer had mentioned, I do not see how Ducky was such a beauty. The pictures of her frightened me... her overlong, thin nose and drooping cheeks were painful to look at. There must be another biographer out there who has depicted Ducky under a more truthful light."
3,Clifford we love you,Clifford the big red dog. In this book clifford is very sad. They try many thing to make him feel better. Noting works. All the neighbor kid tryed to help cheer him but i never worked. So Emily thought of somthing after a while and it worked. It mad Clifford happy again. This book kind of backflashes about all the times Cliffod and Emily spent together.This book is a easier read for younger childern. Older kids will like it too.The pictures in this book are colorful. The show Clifford the big red dog and how he feels. This was a good book.
3,chearful,ok i really like the book it is about a girl who is trying to chear up clifford and nothing works so finally she sings to him!!!
4,A Truthful Book,"The thing I liked most about this book is that it gets the first person male narration of a senior in high school pretty spot on. Paul is a highly successful athlete and scholar in his last year in high school, but is constantly brimming with a pressure-cooker full of rage. He's angry at his father, at people who try to get too close to him, and at the unfairness of life. Most of all, though, he's angry at himself and his confused feelings he feels towards his fourteen-year-old brother who is a ""veg"", as Paul describes him.Many boys will enjoy this book because of the tone of the narration, but also because of the sports story and buzzer-beater ending. While there are some occasional 4-letter words (hello? as I said, he IS a senior in high school), I will recommend this probably to some select kids in my middle school classroom."
3,Stuck in Nuetral : Part Two,"This book is not a sequel to Trueman's masterpiece, but it does offer another viewpoint of the tragic Shawn McDaniel. The ending is very trite,but it will please those who loved Stuck in Nuetral and other Trueman books."
4,good triangle rule,"The rule is very well made, but rather small, with the flats being only 5/8"" wide. It has several measuring methods available and has a brass washer that can be attached to either end. The small size, with correspondingly smaller markings, makes it a little more difficult for me to read than my normal 12"" rules. I'd like it a great deal more if it had 1"" flats with bigger numbers. But, I like the features of the triangle, and it does work well for non-glare with light markings against a flat black bar. So, it's going to stay in my toolbox."
1,AVOID,"ok at first when i got it, it came damaged and i know its not shipping because it was packeged very tight nice neat no damages to the inner or outter box 4 days latter it stopped working the slot for the bulb dosent work well i dont even think it works major safty hazard i had my doubts bout this light quess proved right on to the next 1"
1,Not worth it,Purchased 3 of them and they don't even light half of medium room. You have to stand no more than 2 feet away for blacklight to show up on your clothes. Really disappointed.
3,"Defective, so-so customer service","I ordered 3 of these lights for a New Years party I was having. They arrived on time and were packed well. Upon testing them before the party, I discovered that one was not working. I took the bulb out and put in another bulb and it worked, so obviously either the bulb was burnt out or was damaged in shipping/handling. Whatever the case, I contacted the company and asked them if I overnighted them the defective one if they would overnight me a replacement in time for the party. They said no, they wouldn't ship before the holiday. Didn't make much sense to me but whatever. They said they would email me a return label and submit a refund when they received the item. I never received the label and had to call back the next day to get it. I sent it back and just got the refund yesterday. On the bright side, the other 2 lights worked fine. They were enough to light the majority of a normal sized basement. Easily mounted on my ceiling."
4,great for fishtank,"I bought this light for my aquarium to light up my artificial glowplants. It does the job quite well and my tank looks great at night! This product was inexpensive but not cheap. I've had it on every night for the past two months, so far no problems."
4,Great Product For The Price!,"Had a bit of a SNAFU with the first one I ordered - plugged it in, flickered for a second and then burned out. Amazon was extremely accommodating, however, and sent a replacement right away...which worked well for hours on end during Halloween. The packaging could have been better, maybe some bubble wrap. All that was protecting the bulb was a flimsy piece of cardboard. Can't really complain though - the price is the best I've found for this size blacklight! Good product overall!"
1,You get what you pay for,"Worked for a couple of weeks, already, it's burned out. Bought this for my Son's science project, now I need to find another black light. Beware this product is cheap and flimsy. Save your money!"
3,only good for very small spaces,"I ordered this for a halloween decoration. I had owned one of these as a teenager, and I remembered that they worked well. This one did not work for my purpose. I wanted to light up my very small porch area. I dont know if it was that the space was open or that it was outside, but this light was useless. I have since given it to my teenager to use in her dance studio area, but apparently she doesnt think they are as cool as I did when I was her age. I think for next year we will buy a professional one. Also, the cord was very short."
2,not bright no effect DONNT JUST BUY ONE,the shipping is fast and great and the light is in good condition but it doesnt do anything you need at least 3 of them to get a proper effect.dont get tempted by the price gett one more pricey
3,Pretty good,"It still works, but is rather fragile. The bulb tends to move around, causing the light to go out. But still, for the price it's pretty good."
1,Defective item,The light I received was defective. Just a slight touch or movement to the electrical cord makes the light turn off.
3,Not what I thought,"This light worked, but we found out after the fact that we had to put it directly to the outlet as it would not work on the extention cord that we had... after sever minutes we figured it out, but this would be good to note so that you don't waste the time that we did. Once it got on to the direct current it worked well."
1,Piece of crap,I bought this for a party but it stopped working almost an hour into operation. It's built shoddily hence the price. My loss. I didn't return it because it was bulky to ship. Don't buy.
5,American DJ Blacklights,I received the black lights promptly and they were as good as advertised. We've already used them for a drama performance and they worked perfectly!
2,Just OK,"Ordered for Halloween to put on front porch. Purchased 2 for each side. These are not very bright and do not light up a 12'x 12' front porch. (Had to walk within 2 feet of the light to see the effect) They do work, but no very strong."
3,black light,bought it because it was a great price didn't use it for what I wanted to it is good for people in the arts for lighting
5,Awesome!!,"Shipping was incredibly fast, the lights were bright and filled an entire room, and they really are what they are cracked up to be! Plus, who can beat a price like this? I deffinently reccommend this product if you are looking for some great blacklights! (:"
3,2 foot black light,The black light was used for building science leak detection using fluorescent tracer and helped alot when looking for differening colors.
3,I got what I wanted,"I was looki g to save money, and I did. I wanted a blacklinght, and I got one. It is nt the most powerfull black light available, but is a good value. I now have three and use them regularly. I would buy again from this supplier."
4,GREAT LIGHTS,this blacklight was really great.it was shipped fine it was fast also {UPS}..its great for partys my friends was like WOW..but i know i will have to change the lightbulb soon or later but its very bright i loved it!
4,Satisfactory,"I was very skeptical about buying this product because most of the reviews I've seen for blacklights were full of problems. I had absolutely no problems with shipping. With careful use, I had no problems with burnouts, etc. The bulb did become loose and came out often if I was not careful. I was able to light my event in a 14x14 room well with three of these!"
5,"works wonderfully, VERY sturdy, and low price!!!","Wow. I have searched the internet far and wide and there is not a cheaper blacklight to be found. It works wonderfully, it lights up my entire large living room, and it's very, very sturdy! I'm not kidding- i was using it when suddenly my entire mirror fell on it. I was sure it was a goner, because it went out, but then i adjusted the bulb- and lo and behold, it still worked!So that raises my opinion of it from pretty great to fantastic.:D"
4,Great Blacklight in a manageable size.,"Terrific little blacklight, and with very little buzz. In the same room I also have a 48"" BL from a local shop, but it buzzes terribly (a screeching 19 kHz tone).Very compact, and due to recent discoveries about the workmanship of some previously hammered nails, I've also discovered that this beast holds up to several drops from about 5 feet*.*Your mileage may vary."
2,Vendor great. Product not so much. Shipping disasterous.,"Ordered one. Arrived with bulb intact but fluorescent ballast was faulty. Called Sam Ash (where it actually comes from) and they said they would sent another no charge - keep the first one, too difficult to ship back. Had to call back three times to receive the replacement. Finally arrived (Sam Ash was great about the problem with the order. Took too long, but they took responsibility.) Second finally arrived - with broken bulb. These T-8 bulbs are VERY hard to find for individual sale, and expensive. Rather than risk sending a third, Sam Ash refunded my purchase and told me to keep both defective units. I replaced the T8 ballast in the one and converted the second to a T-12 bulb and ballast for about $25 bucks. I now have two working units. Here's a better idea though: Go to Home Depot. Buy a cheap T12 fluorescent fixture and a T12 fluorescent bulb. Together maybe $20-$35 depending on the fixture you select. T12 bulbs are commonplace."
4,Black Light,This black light works great and was a great price. the only issue I have at all is that the cord is somewhat short.
4,Works,For this price its a good product. Just right for my Teens room and his black light posters. Kept him excited for about 2 weeks.
4,Cost effective,"Light seems somewhat cheaply made but I have no had problems with it so far. It is not that bright so I would need one or two more to sufficiently power my college dorm (it's a relatively large double). I found it a little difficult to mount on a wall without drilling, but eventually figured something out. You pay for what you get. At the end of the day, you definitely have a working blacklight. If a simple starter one is what you seek, buy this."
4,Awesome Black light for so little,"This light came in perfect condition, but the 1 reason i gave it 4 stars is because the bulb is delicate. When i got this i wanted to try it out right away, so i plugged it in and someone must have leaned on it because the bulb came right out of the socket and it was extremely difficult to put back in. But that was the only flaw, the light is now hanging in my room and it lights every inch of my room perfectly."
1,broken on arrival,"really needed this when I got it, but I needed it to work. When I opened the outer box and removed the inner box there was no point to opening the inner box because I could hear the broken glass shifting around in the box."
4,Pretty good,The light works great! It isn't quite as big or as bright as I was expecting but Definatly gives you a mellow mood. Well worth the money!
2,Died after 2 months,"I had two of these units, purchased at the same time. Both died within 2 months of very very light use (maybe 3 hours total), and within a week or so of each other. Don't know yet if it's bulb or ballast, but something is obviously very cheap within these."
4,cheap but adequate,These are the least expensive BLB light and fixtures you will find. They are fine but not really for any huge projects. I am making an alternative photography exposure table so I need about 6 of these so it was the best choice for the money. I havent used it much but we shall see.
3,Decent Black Light,"For $15, you get what you pay for. The light itself comes loose easily and has to be adjusted once in a while, about every 10 times it is turned on. The light itself is not that strong, iDo not know how big my room is, but iHave to stand within 2 feet to notice how the black light affects the color of my clothing. For most rooms that are about 10 ft x 12 ft, iSuggest getting 2 black lights for it to be in full effect."
3,ALMOST as advertised,"Seems to be a quality product... however, the description wrote a check that the product couldn't cash. The listing details clearly state ""6 ft cord""... when measured, fixture to end of plug, it comes in at 4', 11"" ... a full 13"" short of the description. But since this is otherwise a quality product, I will just give it 3 stars out of 5, instead of requesting a partial refund."
4,Just fine.,I have a lava lamp model that I purchased last year that is ready for a tube replacement. I believe these are brighter than the lava lamp was when new. The foil reflector behind the tube helps to make the light stronger but the shape of the housing makes the light viewable over say 45 degrees. I will measure this when I set up for my next photo shoot. I will also measure the distance the light illuminates uv reactive items and follow up . Lamps arrived well packaged and even had a foam tube around the florescent tube. I think this will be handy for travel and I plan to hang on to it.
3,Its ok..,I had Gotten a black light from walmart a couple years ago and the Light from Walmart is far more bright then this one. The Shipping was right on time. Im Planning to throw a small rave themed party but this light is not Strong enough. It doesnt even light up the Bathroom. The package came with a free Velcro Cord tie.
4,American Dj 24inch blb works great.,"i ordered several things about a week ago before i went to camp, when i got home everything had arrived and i was very excited, the american dj light bulb worked perfectly straight out of the box and was the only item that i was satisfied with. if you plan on getting a blacklight get this one.other items i ordered:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001IVVIR4/ref=oh_details_o03_s00_i00http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006M59M6/ref=oh_details_o04_s00_i00http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004U0IRGU/ref=oh_details_o05_s00_i00i should have bought everything from american dj."
3,"a funny book, if not that original","I read this book to my younger sister and it is her favorite book. The illustrations are cute and the story has funny bits. However, I think this whole pirate thing is getting a little tired. I'm sure real sea-going passengers in the past ""age of sail"" would not to be captured by pirates."
1,I don't get it.,"Love the illustrations, and as an adult I liked the story, but I am not crazy about reading it to my grandchildren. I was appalled with the idea of the young boy going off with strangers. While I understand it all takes place in his imagination, as adults, do we take it for granted that youngsters will get that as well?The realizations that being with pirates was not as much fun as the child imagained was cute, but I kept going back to the idea, that this little boy, just goes off without a backwards glance at his parents.I don't think I would recomend this book unless you really, really stress the whole thing takes place in his imagination and we never, ever go off with someone, no matter how much fun they appear to be."
4,Talk like a Pirate review,"This was a fun read for Talk Like a Pirate Day, the students were also able to take and Accelerated Reader test to boost their points. I read it to fourth graders and they enjoyed the read aloud."
5,Henry's Grandma,"Wonderful book! Beautifully illustrated, fun story, not scary for a young child. My 4 yr old loved it!"
3,I have good vision,"Like I said I have 20/20 vision and I have a very hard time seeing the words. I think the story is great and my daughter loves it. I just wish that the print was larger or that I could enlarge it on my Kindle, but that is not an option with this book."
4,Very Cute,"I love the playful yet detailed quality of the illustrations and the cute storyline with phrases on each page for children to exclaim together.I felt the story was a little long, though I'm not sure what I would have taken out. And I felt the brightness/contrast of the illustrations could have been tweaked a bit to make the pages less dark. But overall I was very pleased with this book."
4,David Shannon At His Best,"We are huge fans of David Shannon books like A Bad Case of the Stripes, Duck On a Bike, and The Rain Came Down, so we were a bit unsure about how this collaboration would work out. Shannon chose his collaborator well. This book delivers with a creative plot, interesting characters, and Shannon's trademark illustrations."
3,Maybe not for 4 or 5 year olds,"Perhaps save this for older children, maybe 6 and up? Some of the reasons - the pirates just take the boy with them. They don't ask, nor does the boy tell his parents. With all the real headlines out there, you may not want to have to tell your children why the pirates took him without talking to his parents.Also -no mention where the pirates got their loot. Would be nice if some how the author mentioned they were good pirates.Also the back cover of the book and dustjacket, has a large, full page skull and crossbones on it! Could cause some bad dreams for the little ones.Book could have been better."
5,I DO want to be a pirate,"This book is wonderful. After having two girls, we are now expanding our library to books that will interest my four year old son. He loves this book. It's great for doing voices and playing out the characters. It's fun, with a chance for audience participation. And, of course, the illustrations are excellent."
4,Beautiful illustrations & cute story,"'How I Became a Pirate' is about a little boy who goes away with pirates one day. He learns how to live like a pirate, the joys (eat anything you want, don't brush teeth, go to sleep whenever) and the pitfalls (no one to comfort you, no one to tuck you in). Finally he decides to go back to his family.This story is fun to read and the illustrations even capture my babies's eye :) I do like the importance based on having a family & having someone to comfort you & read to you.The only potential drawbacks & why I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars (and I might be being critical) is that:1.) it might give the message that it is okay to leave your family to go off with strangers2.) also it is fun to not brush your teeth & eat like a slob.Overall, though, I would recommend this book."
5,How I Became a Pirate,"We borrowed this book from the library and my daughter loves it so much we get it over and over again. We bought it for her friend's pirate birthday, and his mom said they have to read it every night! Funny story and great illustrations."
3,"cute, but...","not exceptional. I like the artwork, but the story is not exceptional. my son does not request this book like he does a few others."
2,A word of warning for teachers...,"I was looking for a pirate-themed book to read to my preschool classes, and this one seemed to be popular so I ordered it. After reading it, though, I decided against using it with three- and four-year-olds. I can see from many of these reviews that some children this age love this book, and it is certainly cleverly written (maybe too cleverly - do three's really need to know about Bora Bora? - or does that kind of thing mainly entertain parents?). However, first of all, on the back cover (not just the dust jacket but the real cover too) is a huge skull and crossbones. I may be old-fashioned but I feel this is inappropriate for young children. Also, the pirates, while buffoonish, do look menacing enough to frighten a small child. There are several more innocuous, age-appropriate pirate books for preschoolers."
1,My son cried since the boy was kidnapped!,"This is a very cute book and well written with one major flaw...the litle boy is kidnapped by the pirates!!! My 5 year old son started to cry when the little boy went with the pirates since he knows that it is never OK to go somewhere with another adult and not tell your parent nor should other adults ask a child to help them without their parents knowledge.Please be careful when reading this book to young children as it does not practice ""stanger danger"" and could be very scary to some kiddos."
5,Book for ye scurvy dogs!,"Well laddies (and lasses), I've found the buried treasure! In it, of course, was ""How I Became a Pirate"". By exploring a child's imagination on the beach, we meet a group of friendly pirates with green teeth, if any teeth at all. Long and Shannon take the readers on an adventure into pirate life. However, Jeremy soon realizes that he might miss his life as a boy and having white teeth."
1,The pink book of black magick,Definitely not for Wiccans. Actually...books on magick such as this make female pagans look shallow. :(I'd be ashamed to find this on a Wiccan's bookshelf. Why turn to black magick for the things in this book? Better yet -- write your own spells.
4,"holy crap, i remember this show!","I remember this show from when i was like 10 and obsessed with all things vampiric. you know, castlevania games, vampire hunter d, etc etc. I used to love this show when i was 10 or 12, and have distinct fond memories of it. i always wondered what happened to it. well i sort of stumbled upon it at a local best buy for 10 bucks and i couldn't pass it up. 10 bucks for 21 episodes? now thats a deal!i must admit, being no longer a pre-teen the show has lost a great deal of its magic for me. its still fun and campy but super cheesy. if i'd paid 40 bucks for this series i'd be a little disappointed. but for 10 dollars you cant possibly go wrong.video-wise its a relatively clean transfer. who am i kidding its pretty spectacular given the fact that its a forgotten show from 15 years ago."
4,Pleasing but they could have done better.,Spineshank's 3rd Album is the ShiZ in my opinion but I have heardbetter from them.The opening song (Violent Mood Swings) had anunforgettible beat and so from here on out the beats were alsome!But the lyrics to some and the vocal talents did not grab me.I hope the band doesn't go downhill since Jhonny Santos isleaving.
5,Great CD!,"Self-Destructive Pattern is great! It has doesn't have constant electronic loops as ""The Height of Callousness"", or ""Strictly Diesel"", this is a very raw Metal CD. With songs like ""Smothered"" and ""Fallback"" touching are lighter with an emotional feel, while songs like ""Consumed"" and ""Falls apart"" are heavy.Track listing:1. Violent Mood Swings (3:29)2. Slavery (2:55)3. Smothered (3:07)4. Consumed (Obsessive Compulsive (3:06)5. Beginning (3:32)6. Forgotten (3:19)7. Self Destructive Pattern (3:16)8. Tear Me Down (3:42)9. Stillborn (4:15)10. Falls Apart (2:56)11. Fallback (3:15)12. Dead To Me (3:34)"
2,Truly Self-Destructive,"I'm not a musical genious at figuring out what works for the masses, but I know what works for me. This CD does not! My 1st venture into Spineshank was The Height of Callousness, which I really liked. This CD has very little originality to it, and most of the songs IMHO sound alike in too many ways. I'm not a total prude mind you, but saying the F word, just to say it ruins the context of emotion and angst. I'm not giving up on Spineshank just yet, but Self-Destructive Pattern really turned out true to form for me.. its gonna sit where it is for a long time!"
4,nicely done,"i was timid to buy this album, after hearing that spineshank had gone alot more mellow with ""self destructive pattern"".""height of callousness"" was just too impressive so i had to grab this.i was hooked formt he start.""violent mood swings"" and ""slavery"" sound like outtakes from ""height of callousness"" while ""smothered"" is a decent attempt at a single.the album picks it up toward the end with ""stillborn"" rocking it out to the end.this album might startle some spineshank fans, as it is in the wake of the singles of the last album (""new disease"" and ""synthetic"").good effort."
4,Act your RAGE!!!,"I was never really that into Spineshank before until I caught 'Smothered' on a music channel once and I thought ""this is kinda cool"" and then I saw this album 'Self Destructive Pattern' for a good price in a store, and so I thought to myself ""what the hell!"" and I didn't regret it afterwards!They've totally gotten themselves off that turgid nu-metal bandwagon, and in for a more industrial metal sound with a hint of thrash! Yes, that's right, thrash! The only thing that's stopping this album from getting the full 5 stars is that only SOME songs still have that nu-metal feel, and some of the lyrics are a little retarded too. But that is something I can ignore, this is a great CD and great fun to listen to."
4,spineshank,"great cd, even though they softened out from the last cd(height of callousness) this is one band who can soften out and still be great i highly recommend it"
4,Excellent hard rock with Industrial flavor,"This album just rocks - plain and simple. It took a couple of listens for the songs to really click and get into my blood, but once it happened I didn't want to stop listening. On this album Spineshank pulled off the perfect balance between heavy lyrics and melody - between metal and industrial, and most of the songs just slam. I picked up their previous release, The Height of Callousness, after I got this one and I like Self-Destructive Pattern better, although they're both good. I heard the band broke up and reformed and that we can expect another great album sometime in the next year. I just hope it's sooner rather than later."
1,THIS PRODUCT IS A SHAM!! NEVER BUY THIS!!!!,"I didn't pay attention to the other person who reviewed this product and regretted it. I can confirm with everything the first reviewer said. The dictionary is horrible. Furthermore I tried to return it and couldn't. I played phone tag with 5 different companies who kept transferring me and wouldn't give me this code that I needed to return it. This code is NOT on your invoice and can only be had by phoning this company, but since no one I talked to would give it to be, I couldn't return it. They said they would call me back, they didn't. They said they would email me back, they didn't. Furthermore you only have 14 days to return it so basically I got screwed. I lost $140 on a product that is so bad I will never use it. Amazon.com should be ashamed for letting the company who made this product sell it on their site."
4,Good for casual use.,Device came as expected and worked great out of the box. I am using it as a dyi mechanic. Probably not the best for a pro... but then that's why the price is so good.
3,Caveat Emptor: look at the song list before purchasing.,"There are some very obscure and unfamiliar songs included on these 8 cds. Not sure where they were ""hits"" because I never heard them before. Maybe they were top 40 in places like the middle east or europe in the 80s - I don't know. I didn't like most of them. I think after reviewing all the disks I liked perhaps 15 songs in the entire collection. There is nothing wrong with the disks or the music. The Quality is good. Just be sure that you review the song list before purchasing."
5,Greatest Hits in Europe not U.S.,"Many people who are disappointed in these imported Greatest Hits collections don't seem to realize that these are IMPORTED. These songs were all legitimate hits in Europe, usually Great Britain, but not necessarily in the U.S. If someone is looking for familiar American radio greatest hits don't buy imports, buy U.S. collections.For those who wish to hear what they were listening to in England or elsewhere try the imports. They have enough familiar tunes to satisfy as well as others that are just as good and will grow on you in time. If you are only looking for memories stick with U.S. compilations otherwise explore and enjoy."
4,Greatest Hits of the 80's,A very comprehensive collection of 80's 'hit' music that presents a wide range of the musical tastes of the 'glam rock' decade.
2,Where are the greatest hits?,"In a few words, I can explain why I think this collection fails as a ""greatest hits of the 80's"" album. There is an absence of: Eurythmics, George Michael, Corey Hart, Wham, and just take a look at the track list, because mine goes on. I guess for the bargain price, expectations can't be set that high. You get what you pay for."
2,Only some of the Greatest Hits of the 80's,"To be perfectly honest, there are some phenomenal songs on this set. Jermaine Stewart's classic, ""We Don't Have to Take Our Clothes Off,"" is one song that makes the highlight reel for this compilation. Songs by Huey Lewis & the News, Duran Duran, Kim Wilde, et al, earn this box set its two stars. However, a majority of the songs on this compilation are not necessarily worthy of being classified as ""greatest hits."" Unfortunately, the forgettable songs of the ""Me Decade"" and price make this set undesirable."
5,A Definite MUST read - If your child has behavioral problems!,"This book is great at explaining the differences between ADHD, and Child-Onset Bipolar disorders. It explains the different types of Child-Onset bipolar also. My son exhibits the Atypical Bipolar, which comes out in more aggressive, easily frustrated behaviors vs. typical manic / depressive stages. Bipolar in children is much different, than bipolar in adults!!! This book explains it so well, and I highly recommend it!! I highlighted so much of the book, and then took it to the doctor! Give it to the grandparents to read, your spouse, (your ex ;) and anyone who has a close relationship with your child. I have read several books on bipolar disorder in children... and this one is one of the best!!"
2,A little biased,"An interesting read; however, the same thing is said over and over and over and over (get the idea?) He does make interesting points -- that I agree with about the disorder; but, this could have been said in a much more concise way. Tooooooooo much repetition. Save your $$. Don't bother."
5,Perfect with Melting Candy!!,"My husband and I used this with Wilton Candy Melts to make peppermint bark to give to teachers at school as a Christmas gift. So much more cost effective than buying pre-made candy, and it was so very easy! Great tasting, and very easy to work with."
5,Christmas Candies,"Only place I found peppermint candies for my Christmas Bark!THANK YOU!! LOVE IT, will order again!HAPPY HOLIDAYS...LOVE IT!"
2,"Great Exhibition, Disappointing Catalogue","I journeyed to the Walters Art Gallery, Baltimore to see the exhibition. ""MANET - The Still Life Paintings"" which is on view until April 22, 2001. The show was previously at the Musee d'Orsay in Paris. It is a lovely, intimate show. The majority of these gorgeous still lifes of fruits, vegetables and flowers were painted in the last three years of Manet's life. Unfortunately, the catalogue does not begin to do these beautful oil paintings and watercolors justice. The book's colorplates are of unsatisfactory quality and fail to capture the sumptuousness of these touching works of art. The book measures just shy of 9 inches by 9 inches, too small to get any partial enjoyment after seeing the exhibition. The text does not advance art scholarship. Not worth the price."
2,review,"Arrived in a timely manner, consistent with other orders placed through the Amazon website. Within 3 weeks, the item failed to properly operate, and when I contaced the seller, he was less than cooperative in attempting to rectify the order. Upon contacting Amazon directly, I received a credit to my account for the full price."
1,Whirlpool Deforst Timer...Only worked for nine months,They shipped fast. It fit fine. They included all needed instructions. Only problem is that it quit working nine months later.
2,JA Henckels saucepan,"The saucepan handle disappointed. The handle is ""ergonomically"" bent at an angle. For me, the ""grabbing"" end of the handle is too stubby to allow for good balance when the pan is full/heavy. The part of the handle that attaches to the saucepan gets HOT. Unfortunately, this is the natural place to rest your thumb when balancing a full/heavy pot.This is a deal-killer for me. JA Henckels will not be my replacement cookware. All Clad still gets my vote."
4,New American Commentary - Luke,The book arrived in a reasonable time & was in excellent condition. Everything was as specified in the narrative before ordering.
2,This book depends on what you like,"I usually don't read this type of book so if you're into love stories you might like it, but I didn't really. I read it, not enjoying it and reading every word but reading to see if it picked up. it sorta did but not in the way I usually expect books to. My favorite part in the book was when she was taken back in Time for the first time, and from then on I didn't like it. If you like love stories with some parnormal twists go for it. But if you dig fantasy, or hard historical fiction I wouldn't recomend it."
3,"A Posthumous, Libertarian Fantasy from Verne","Jules Verne's ""Magellania"" is a fascinating glimpse into looking at life in an idealized, libertarian society. Here he has one of his most charismatic figures since Captain Nemo in the figure of the expatriate European Kaw-djer (name means ""benefactor"" in the local American Indian language) who forsakes his monastic existence to help a shipwrecked colony of nearly one thousand immigrants. Eventually he agrees to become their leader, judiciously ruling during times of famine and strife caused by a gold rush on the island. This translation is among the most lyrical I have read of Verne's works, yet I agree that the story often resembles more an outline for a great novel than a slender, well-written tale. Still, this is one of Verne's most interesting works since it is a fictious examination of his political philosophy, which was apparently a lot more libertarian in scope than many have regarded previously."
3,"Not 20,000 Leagues","This book did not resemble 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea. In fact, I would hazard to guess that it is a different book entirely. Still, I give it three stars because I am afraid of Jules Verne's vengeful ghost."
4,Worked for me!,"I have an awfully painful bunion om my right foot and don't want surgery. Bunion cushions don't work so I thought I would try this. I must say, it worked for me. When the bunion is painful I wear it at night and it can also be wore under shoes, no problem. Well worth the purchase!"
1,worthless product,I found this product to be worthless casuing more pain in my foot/toe. It did not straighten out my bunion nor could it. I would not recommend this product to anyone.
4,toe straightener,I used this for months but have gotten away from using it lately.I would recommend it though to anyone who would have a need.
4,GOOD PRODUCT AND SHIPPING,"FITS WELL, NOT COMFORTABLE IN ALL TYPES OF SHOES, BUT I HAVE A REALLYH WIDE FOOT. SO FAR SO GOOD,"
1,Doesn't do anything,"It looks like a great idea, but it doesn't have any pull to keep the toe aligned out. It just fits over the big toe (takes up space in the shoe) and sits there. The strap across the heel is not adjustable and doesn't do anything either. A complete waste of money."
5,Definitely helpful and decidedly reversable,"Like Valerie, I am not sure why the first reviewer couldn't make these work on both feet. I got two exactly the same articles in a box, just flip it over to fit the other foot. I'm wearing both of them! They are definitely helpful, though not quite as ""strong"" a corrector as the velcro-on plastic devices. But, these can be worn under socks/in shoes so can be worn during the day, at work, etc., which the other thing cannot."
1,not worth it!,"I have a small foot and maybe that is why I didn't get much help from this product, but the only result I had was my toes started getting cold as if my circulation was being cut off. I tried it for a week and found no ounce of improvement. My advice is put your money into something worth it and don't look for a good ""cheap"" deal!"
1,Squeezes Too Much,Way too tight around my foot. I have a very narrow foot and have to take this off after an hour or so. Feels like it stops my circulation!
3,Not so Sure,This item was bought because a doctor botched a surgery and now I have a real problem with my big toe trying to lay on top of the next toe. The straightener works for a while but after a lot of walking it rides up the toe and doesn't seem to do what I need it to.
1,bunion toe misrepresentation,"Item was described to fit most shoes, but the bulkiness of item makes shoes already owned to fit uncomfortably tight creating additional pressure on feet.Presenting it as Toe Straightener is misrepresentation as there's strong doubt item could actually accomplish that."
2,Ehh... so-so,"I like the idea but its just not comfortable enough. (btw, I use the gel separators mostly.)I thought this toe straightener would be great for wearing to bed (so I didn't have to wear socks), but it always felt tight. My circulation may be be a little less than optimal, so perhaps that is why. If you have low circulation, I do not suggest this product."
4,"So far, so good","I've been using this for maybe two weeks, I believe I missed a day or two, but I am starting to feel relief.I do not recommend this for people who have really bad bunions and for severe cases. I just notice how bad mine have gotten, I wore a lot of heels this winter and sandals this summer so I suppose that is the culprit.But I am noticing a difference. I guess you can wear them at night; but sometimes it wakes me up at night. Which I don't care, I just get up and take it off but that's a few more hours that I've had it on to correct my foot while I'm sleeping. I can't wear these with everyday shoes. Maybe other people can."
4,Some difference,"I am unable to wear this with shoes because the fit is somewhat off. I have a lot of extra material on the toe; this would cause over crowding in my shoes if I wore them. However, I do wear them under my socks when I am at home. I do feel some relief. They are not very tight on my feet but I am only a size 6. If the toes portion fit better I would have given them 5 stars. They aren't a miracle cure for bunions but for the price they are a helpful item."
2,Painful,"This product didn't work for me. I have a large bunion, this doesn't straighten it out at all. And after it is on for an hour or two the entire bunion has an intense burning pain and I have to rip my shoe off and remove it. Also there is a huge seam right over the bunion and if you have this on under your shoes this just creates more pressure and tightness in this area. Maybe they are too tight?"
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"It did nothing to straighten my toe and in fact caused a blister on the bottom of my foot. Stuff cotton between your toes, it's cheaper and works better."
1,toe straightener,piece of crap and definately not what it is advertised to be. Do not purchase this product. It is junk save your money.
3,Toe straightener,My husband says this one will work while wearing shoes.The little heel strap tends to become displaced when putting on socks.He's uncertain as to whether it improves his discomfort due to the bunion.
2,No Improvement,I recently had surgery to correct a bunion on my left foot which also caused my great toe to lean into and push my other toes to the left. The doctor said my great toe would drift back a little toward the smaller toes and it did. I purchased this to try and keep my great toe aligned correctly but it did not help at all. It was comfortable to wear but did nothing to pull the toe into the correct position. I ended up purchasing silicone toe spacers which work much better to keep the toe from rubbing against the one next to it.
2,Not Impressed,I was not impressed. I tried t sleep in this but the piece between my toes bothered my second toe as it bunched up. It also made my foot numb and I have a very small and narrow foot. The foot band did not stay on my foot. I could not wear this in my shoes for the same reason I can't sleep in it.
2,"Sorry, one size does not fit all.",I got this for someone else and she has a wide foot. The elastic is so tight it hurts her foot after about 20 minuets. therefore she cannot wear it.
2,bunion straightener,It is bulky in it structure where the toe connects and causes swelling and is not very comfortable to wear.
2,"""Toe Straightener""","I received this in good time and am very pleased with the people I ordered it from; however, it is not the product that will truly ""straighten"" out the bunion. I wore it for several days and can't see any difference in my toes at all."
4,Past BAR questions/answers in book form w/ writing strategy.,"The book is written by a San Francisco Public Defender, past bar exam grader and essay exam writer. He organizes numerous past bar exam essay questions in two volumes. He provides a strategy for organizing and solving the 13 essay topics and provides comprehensive model answers. The book demands an active learning approach and explains how an essay is graded by the Bar Examiners. If you want to know what's expected of you to pass the essay portion of the exam, this is the book. However, it can be discouraging to see how smoothly an experienced attorney can dissect questions even the best law students would stumble over. It just goes to show again that the most important thing I learned in law school was how stupid I really was and how much I had to learn."
2,"Actually, It's Pretty Inaccurate","I would give Bar Breaker's an A for organization and inspirational ideas and an D for accuracy with respect to statements of law, both implied and express. Literally, almost every single ""model"" answer has either a total mis-statement of law or fails to discuss a major issue that is implicated by the fact pattern. I believe that some of these answers would not even receive a passing grade. There are even mis-statements of criminal law, which is kind of scary considering that Adachi oversees the criminal defense of every indigent person in San Francisco. I'm surprised that more people aren't pointing this out. I suspect that these reviewers might have some connection to the author. Just be sure not to rely on Adachi's legal analysis as accurate. For the exam tips, it's great. Also, it's very helpful to have the essays organized by category as he has done."
5,A revelation!,"I was one of those law students who never got law school. The law did not make sense to me. I didn't know which rules were important and couldn't really do IRAC. I thought I was doing IRAC but then I read Adachi and realized I had been stumbling around in the dark.I graduated ranked 90 out of 109 from a mediocre law school and was told by three professors that I would never pass the bar. And I did! I passed the California bar exam on the first try and I attribute it to Adachi. Write all the essays in the books, buy every product he has and just keep going. 2 essays, 25 mpc, and go throught 3 sets of flashcards every day for two months and you will pass the bar.If I had read these books during law school, I know my ranking would have been different. It's not about reinventing the wheel, it's about being a sheep and copying great people who have passed before you- get the books and don't look back!"
4,Hoelderlin - 'Holderlin's Traum' (Spalax),"Originally released in 1972, as I believe this was the progressive / folk band's first effort. Liked what I'm hearing here. Tracks that had me listening to this CD reissue a second time are ""Waren War"", ""Requiem Fur Einen Wicht"", ""Erwacken"" and the seven-minute melodic ""Traum"". Personnel: Nanny DeRuig - vocals, Christian Grumbkow - guitar, Joachim Grumbkow - acoustic guitar, cello, flute, keyboards & mellotron, Peter Kaseberg - bass & vocals, Peter Bursch - sitar, Mike Hellbach - tablas, Christoph Noppeney - violin, flute & piano and Michael Bruchmann - drums & percussion. Definitely worth a listen."
3,Not convinced,"One worked well, but the other insert, was only working with 2 poles(+ and ground), so for that reasonI had to make that output a mono one. That caused that what ever was heard on that output sounded withless volume that the other stereo output. :/ The other thing that I disliked was that as I inserted anadaptor for earphones, the input worked for a while and then it stopped, I constantly need to betouching the input, or pluging it in with extra force. I think the design is poor in quality."
4,"Good book, would make a better movie than G&G","This book is an excellent novel on the Civil War. Being my major, and having read many accounts of the war, both fiction and non-fiction, I would rank this with some of the great fiction accounts of the war. It is not Red Badge of Courage, Shiloh, or the Killer Angels, which are considered the pinnacle of the genre, but it is a good read, encompassing a wider range of POVs than most of the other works. It takes elements from each of the works I have mentioned, and uses them to create a story in which it is easier to see how these people were.Fredericksburg is often compared with Gods & Generals... I can only say that I believe that Fredericksburg would make the better movie, if kept faithful to the book (unlike G&G, which was bogged down by civilian drivel for a good portion of the movie). But, considering Hollywood and the lukewarm reception recieved by many Civil War movies, I would not want to see how this good piece of war fiction would be mutilated."
4,Interesting and quirky!,"As an American of Norwegian descent who was raised in England, I found this book very interesting. Nimmo tells his tale in a quite funny way (VERY British), and skillfully weaves in old tales of Viking history. He points out the oft-overlooked impact of Norse upon English custom and language. The descriptions of the natives of Scandinavia he runs into give the reader a taste for having spoken to them personally. His run-ins with various types are often absurdly humorous. If you have a passing interest in Scandinavia and/or its history, this is a great book to pick up. It's very readable: you'll fly right through his skilled prose. In terms of style, think of this book as a combination of Paul Theroux and Douglas Adams!"
2,there are better items available,"I tried to save a few dollars in purchasing a number of Stanley products....what a foolish mistake.....I should have gone with the better products (Klein, for example)....this is nothing beyond mediocre."
1,Deleted,"I started reading book, and was enjoying it.Early on, the Name of the Lord was ""taken in vain"". That ruined it for me.It was my first Margaret Way book. It is my last Margaret Way book.I deleted it from my Kindle, reading no further."
2,Birding Northern California,"I ordered this for use in my daughter's 6th grade science class in Oakland. Unfortunately, it contains no photographs of the birds--only text descriptions of viewing locations. So it's not useful as an identification guide. The general description should clearly state this. JM"
2,A mixed bag.....,The first chapter sets things up very well and then drags for about 100 pages after that....did not care about most of the chracters...then the last fifty or so pages...wonderfull insight into emotions of the players involved. My only complaint is the male lead really has the deck stacked against him....a sequel would be nice....with a strong editor to help the author use those strong feelings she has access to.
3,Disappointing,"I'm a big fan of political thrillers, but I found THE NEXT PRESIDENT lacking. A much more creative and thought-provoking presidential conspiracy is THE JINX, by Larry Kahn, a wonderful little surprise that I found browsing Amazon.com!"
3,"Good book, but lack of reality","When I picked this book up , I thought I was getting a good, thrilling novel. Well,it is thrilling, but it lacks reality. This is my first Flynn novel, and I'd say that if the novel were more realistic and less confusing in the end, I'd be definetly giving a five star rating to this book. J.D. Cade is a great chracter, in fact all of the characters were fully developed and everything. I'd recommend this book, if you are up for something thrilling but not really realistic."
1,Unbelievable...,"...how bad this book is. I've been a thriller lover most of my life, and am usually pretty forgiving of minor flaws as long as the story is good. Unfortunately, this book is one of those rare exceptions. The plot is very weak and extremely unbelievable and the characters are cardboard figures, uninteresting and poorly developed. The only reason I kept reading it was because of the mostly favorable reviews posted here and I figured the book HAD to get better. The only real mystery involved with The Next President is where was Joseph Flynn's editor and why was it published. The only thrill for me was when I finally came to the end. I know some of you reading this negative review will be skeptical of it since it is in the minority of reviews to date. However, I don't want to see you waste your time and money -- as I did."
3,Disappointed,"This is not the novel I would take on vacation. This thriller just didn't cut it with me. It was just too fake. J.D. Cade's ease at getting so close to the President and his campaign just seems so far fetched, as was DeVitos hatred and suspicions about him from their first meeting because he came off as a rich man but didn't have a manicure.Mr. Flynn's previous novel 'Digger' was much better than this recent effort.My recommendation is.....The library"
4,Neil Simon 3-Pack Contents,"This set consists of three made-for-tv movies: The Sunshine Boys with Woody Allen, Peter Falk and Sarah Jessica Parker; Jake's Women with Alan Alda, Mira Sorvino, Anne Archer, Lolita Davidovich, Julie Kavner, Joyce Van Patten; London Suite with Kelsey Grammer, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Madeline Kahn, Julie Hagerty, Richard Mulligan, Patricia Clarkson. All are full-frame because in mid-1990's made-for-TV movies were not usually made widescreen. Each runs about 90 minutes. All three are very good. I especially like The Sunshine Boys because of the good acting of the classic original play (opened up for TV). A good value, highly recommended set, all films beautifully acted & directed."
4,Well worth it despite modern production,"It is the only recording currently available of this opera which is complete, including ballet music at end. (I'm not sure it's absolutely complete, as I did not follow with a score.) The singing is very good to acceptable, and the production is in good taste. A valuable addition to the recorded repertory."
3,Lowers the Subwoofer Gain,"This was a little odd. I had both sets of knobs turned to the same positions (all the way clockwise). With the controller plugged in, it works fine, but when I unplug the controller, the subwoofer gets louder. I don't think this thing should make a difference. With my new stereo I can control the sub level separately so I don't really use this anymore."
3,It works,"This item is a very standard cigarette lighter to USB charger for whatever components you have. It is rated for a higher current (850mA) than the home computer (500mA). Technically it should charge things a bit faster but I noticed nothing significant. Without something proper I can test with, I do not have any values to state. The components themselves may have a current limiting charging system. The plastic cosmetically...ugly, but no one really buys it for looks. Its a bit bulky, it sticks out farther than I thought."
1,I DON'T SUGGEST BUYING THIS MODEL,"I bought this as a gift for Christmas. When the package arrived, I opened it to test it. After setting it up, and powering it on, the monitor flickered on for a second. The power supply light was blinking green which was an indication to me that something was wrong with the power supply. I went on the manufacturer's web site for troubleshooting solutions and to see what they had posted about this particular model. Apparently the manufacturer, Princeton Graphics, is fully aware of the problems with this model's power supply, and has since discontinued selling these models."
4,increases alertness and dexterity for me,"And even improves a little bit of my thinking skills at the same time. The only issue I have with this product is that it is only 5mg. Most other products are 10mg and I notice a much better performance from those products (and yes, I know I can take 2 pills).I don't get the same effect with only taking 5mg as I do with the 10mg version from another source (Source naturals). With 10mg, I definitely notice a difference when playing video games. With the 5mg version, I barely feel a difference.I'm going to start taking 2 of these pills to up the dosage.Recommended if you are on the mental decline or need something to give a little edge when studying."
2,tired!,I don't hate it as it didn't make me sick but I had NO positive effects and in fact after taking it all I could bring myself to do was sleep! I really needed to be able to stay awake in order to study.
2,Not for me. Your Experience may vary.,"I seem to get a racing mind feeling and headaches when I use Vinpocentine. I have therefor discontinued use of this product. I can't tell you if it made my brain work any better, however my discomfort undoubtedly overshadowed any increases in mental performance."
1,Very Disappointing!,"I was skeptical about the quality of these pillows at such a low price but the reviews were so positive that I thought I'd give them a try anyway. Upon receiving them, I'm led to believe that the reviews are actually for a different pillow in the Pacific Coast line. I did not have high expectations because I knew they were feather, not down, but I found them to be heavy and dense. But worst of all, the ""special finishing that makes them leak proof"" CRACKLES because there is evidently a layer of plastic/vinyl which serves to prevent the feathers from poking through. Oh well, I guess I should have know better... I'll be returning them."
2,"Don't Get these, get he $49.99 Pacific Coast Eurofeather PILLOWS","I have a set of the $49.99 pillows that are titled ""Pacific Coast Feather EuroFeather Queen Pillows, Set of 2""""Pillows"" instead of this item which has ""Pillow"". It is well worth the $20, these cheap pillows are no were near as conforming as the $49.99 version. You can really feel the quills through the pillow but with a pillow cover not as much. I would recommend the $49.99 versions but not the $29.99 ones."
1,"I hate these pillows, they smell like a henhouse!","Granted I have never had feather pillows before so maybe this is what is to be eppected but they have no neck support whatsoever, they make disturbing crunching noises whenever I move my head and they positively REEK like a dirty henhouse. Gross! Home on the range ain't for me. I detest these, and threw them out."
4,A fine (but slightly incomplete) translation,"I haven't had a chance to read this early work by Marcel Proust yet, but if you're interested in buying a copy, it's worth knowing that while A.N. Wilson, translator of the Hesperus Press edition, reports having used ""with profit"" this ""fine translation"" by Louise Varese, this edition does not include the poems entitled ""Portrits of Painters and Musicians"", but the Hesperus Press edition does so. Also included in the Hesperus Press edition but missing from this one are translations of the preface by Anatole France, and the dedication to Willie Heath."
4,bette midler is great,"I believe that she is one of the most fantastic artist of all times, the way she can sing from a low voise into a high. I always liked to sing along, but now I got to sing alone as Bette Midler?"
5,Colorful Beauty on canvas,Post cards took me back to another place in time. Such Color ! Such Grace! Such Beauty! Definately will frame them and have different pictures each month. My guests will love all the rich beauty they see
2,Looks are deceiving,"Judging by the picture alone I would have given this item 5 stars! Which is why I ordered it. Unfortunately, the item does not look like the picture. It's not nearly as full looking in person, kind of scrawny actually. It must be the angle and lighting they used to make it look more full. The box was smashed when I got it and I spent an hour ""fluffing"" it just to get it to look half way decent. So be warned. I've seen better at Walmart and Michaels for less then half the cost. Not worth $88.00 in my opinion plus another 20 in shipping (smashed box, no packing material). Do yourself a favor and buy one at Michaels for [...] bucks and save on the shipping."
3,It's ok.,"I wasn't verry impressed with this Die Form album. It's too slow this time around. Not that it was horrible or anything....I mean, it's still Die Form. I guess I just prefer Die Form when the make faster beats, like thier song ""Silent Order"". Anyways, Die Form make the best sex music, and as far as a night of dark erotic play, this album will suffice quite nicely."
2,Great photos but that's it,"I had high expectations of learning more about the thought process that goes into the creation of Oudolf's garden's, useful information on structures and habits of particular plants. However there is none of that. The photos of gardens are beautiful and you can learn from looking - but info on individual plants is pretty minimal, and there is no discussion on the creating aspect of the gardens. I wouldn't recommend it."
4,Great!,"This was my first experience with a component cable. When I ran out of hdmi ports on my tv, I listened to the previous reviewer and was not disappointed. The satellite installer even commented on the construction of this cable and quality of the signal, after he tried to talk me out of using it. I totally agree with the previous reviewer and only give it 4 stars because of my lack of experience with other cables."
4,"Nice cable, nice price","Only 4 stars? Well, I figure you have to get a perfect image to get 5 stars. These cost a couple bucks more than other budget components, but far less than overpriced junk like Monster, and the performance overall is sharper with cleaner color and contrast than the OEM wire that came with my HD cable box. I've used this product for several years now and have yet to be disappointed. There are a couple of $200-plus competitors that look slightly better than these, but not $200 better. The audio wire is OK, not harsh and stringent like cheaper stuff. Recommended. And I'm very picky about image quality."
4,Pleasantly surprised,"This is actually a very nice duvet cover. The ""monogram"" thing is not as big as it looks in the picture, in fact quite understated. Furthermore the other side is just the solid linen color so if you didn't like the monogram you can just turn it over. I bought the matching shams too and they look very nice together with white sheets and pillowcases."
1,Terrible second edition of a masterful collection,"The Painter of Modern Life and Other Essays (Arts & Letters)This is a second edition of a fine essay collection. Alas, it's barely readable. The onionskin on which it is printed is so fine that the reverse side bleeds through. The print itself begs a magnifying glass (well, no - that's a bit exaggerated - but it's very tiny). The gutter size is so miserly that to fully open the book you practically have to break the binding. Forget any marginalia you wish to write - no room in the outside margins. Phaidon (the publisher) - are you listening? I will NEVER buy another book of yours unless I physically see it first. It's a real shame too because the notes are very scholarly, the picture plates are good too.My advice is to look for this book in its FIRST edition (around 1967) - I found one at the library in paperback. Generous margins, gutter, and print size."
2,Shoulder Pulley,It was a bit hard to this to the right length and to be stable. I would not purchase this if you are looking at a long term product for your shoulder. It is portable which is good but then have to find a door that the clampwill fit or it will be too lose or tight to work.
4,Very Good Product,"The Home Ranger shoulder pulley works very well. I'm using it as a supplement to physical therapy for my shoulder and find that it does the job. It's quiet, stays in place well over the door and is easy to put up and take down. My only slight complaint is that sometimes the rope will slip if you move the handle further up the rope to get a better stretch. Overall, I got what I expected and would recommend this product."
5,Great product !!,"I rated this product with 5 stars because of the quality, and the speed of delivery. This is a good product to use if you have range of motion problems like I do. Because of severe arthritis in the neck and shoulder area I wasn't able to use my arms fully. Since I have been using the Shoulder pulley, I have noticed that I do have more range of movement.I would most definitely recommend this product !!Thank you so much !!!"
2,Do not buy...Flimsy cannot hold all the bottles,"I am afraid to stock this fully as I think it will fall apart. NOT WORTH THE MONEY...It is very flimsy and I don't think it can hold 48 bottles and stay together. AVOID THIS WINERACK, not built to handle magnums but also will not hold anything else."
3,Zometool Bucky Balls,Zometool products have my full and hearty applause. I had a goal however of finding a product that would make more geometric shapes and it wasn't totally clear to me that Bucky Balls would not meet my demands. It's application is very limited because it contains only one shape in stick form to fit in one shape of the ball. It would seem that Creator 1 or some of the other Zometool products would be better suited to my needs. I look forward to exploring the other products. I only wish that they were more readily available in Canada!
2,It never fails,"It never fails; you see a collection or anthology of books, films, whatever. You eagerly order it, can't wait to open it, and then read or view it. Then reality. I don't know if I changed or the films in question, but none of the subject matter in this collection is the least bit funny, sexy, or weird enough to be interesting. Times change and products from years ago run the risk of being, well, irrelevant. Such is this product."
4,Llove Roger Cormans films,Whats to say. You either like Roger Corman low budget exploitation films or you do not. This is a good grouping of his films. Break out the popcorn and enjoy! Lots of fun!
5,Good stuff!,"If you're into cheesy old late night movies then this is the stuff of legend! The acting is bad....the filming uses a lot of repeat scenes. But hey...you aren't looking for epic you are looking to watch and blast the movies with friends, its a good time!"
2,Prairie Bride,"Sarah is a mail-order bride looking to escape a scandalous past in the east and hoping for a fresh start. Briggs is a jilted farmer with a huge chip on his shoulder hoping to avoid further emotional entanglement by marrying a woman he doesn't know. All of the secrets, deceptions and a general failure to communicate between these two characters made this a hard story to enjoy. This story was full of heartache, most of which could have been avoided by simple honesty much earlier in the story than it occurred. Living on the prairie in a sod house, produces trials enough, and watching them work together to get through those hardships, was by far the best part of this story. The ending was nice, but I felt like you had to wade through quite a bit to get there."
4,Not what I expected!,I didn't expect this story line at all. I guess I was hoping for the more common mail-order bride story. It does explain the hardships of living on the Plains and all they had to go through.
3,A Kansas Bride,"The author gets your attention with a mail order bride that has a questionable past and a rugged prairie farmer that has been rejected. Here the two face the hardships of life on a Kansas farm. Briggs finds himself with a beautiful wife that he cannot trust. Sarah has the secrets of her past that she tries to keep to herself. All of this plays a part in the reader never being able to predict what is going to happen. You will enjoy this book that gives you a real picture of life in a Kansas' sod hut and all their environmental problems. By Ruth Thompson the author of ""Bluegrass Dream"""
3,Prairie Bride,I think this book would have been more enjoyable without all the mystery and deceit. The best parts of the book were when Sarah was learning the way of life on the prairies. It was so interesting that I didn't even need the romance. With all the distrust throughout the book it didn't seem very romantic anyway. I would have liked it if the author had written more about their future. Did they build a home? For a first novel it was very good.
2,Over Priced.,"Not a bad item, but it is over priced, I bought the same gun at Big Lots a couple of months ago for only 40 dollars."
4,Feng Shui Body Brush,"The Feng Shui Body Brush is great. This brush makes cleaning your back easy. Also, with the plastic handle no worrying about the mold that tends to grow around brushes with wooden handles. The mesh is gentle and feels much better than the stiff brushes of many other body brushes on the market."
1,"Snap, crack & Break~!","DO NOT PURCHASE~! I puchased two of these because I liked the style and they were hard to find. My mistake was not reading the reviews first. Oh they look well made & sturdy, however on the FIRST USE with both, the handle snapped~! Yes with virtually mild pressure the handles snapped in two~! You think they would try to keep a customer happy & offer a refund or replacement? NO, the response I recieved was ""the items were shipped new from the manufacturer"". I spent $18, if you multiply that times the possible sales thats allot of unhappy ripped off consumers. Read the reviews, don't buy & save yourself dissappointment & money."
1,Not recommended,"After using this body brush only two times, it has begun to unravel. I would advise not buying this product."
1,Broke on the first use.,It broke the very first time I used it. Absolutely do not recommend this brush to anyone! Not worth the money I paid.
4,Essential for any Deadhead or New Riders fan!,"I have the original LP of this and consider it an essential piece of my massive Grateful Dead puzzle. This was when the Dead were ""on a break"" and Jerry's playing with everyone from his own band to Merl to Paul Kantner, Phil has a band called Too Loose to Truck which literally played bar gigs with Heinekens flowing, and Bobby's teamed up with Dave Torbert and Matt Kelly to create this smooth ensemble. Remember that at the time, nobody was really sure what a hiatus for the Dead meant, and Kingfish could have blossomed if the Dead had remained on the bricks. The ""Lazy Lightning>Suppication is fluid and trippy, and the rest is NRPS quality jamming but with a strong lead guitar and harp in Matt Kelly. I love the Riders, I love the Flying Burrito Brothers, and I love this album. If you do too, check out the King Biscuit release!"
5,A FLASH FROM THE PAST,MANY YEARS AGO THE KINGFISH GROUP PLAYED IN JUNEAU ALASKA THEY HUNG OUT WITH US AND I WANTED TO REVISIT THE SONGS AND VOICES LOVED IT THEN AND LOVE IT NOW
2,Strange remix of a classic album,"At long last I decided to purchase the digital form of one classic 5 star record I've owned with joy for over 30 years. Never before have I noticed such a stark difference in sound between the original record and a CD. The whole CD sounds like you are listening with tin cans pressed over your ears. I used to usher Dead shows and I barely recognize what they've done to Bobby's voice, no song, no sound system I have ever heard made his voice sound remotely like this CD does. As for the instruments the high end of drum and guitar sounds almost hurt. It's worse than sterilization, this is castration! Which is no small (de)feat with my tube amp warming up some 1950's klipshorns. If you own this album do not buy this CD, pay double or more if you must, but digitize from your vinyl version. I do sincerely hope they remaster this someday."
2,If it seems too good to be true....,"you know the rest of that saw.These ~$25@piece pillows are fine for a camp outing in the back yard or a guest room maybe. However, the quills do in fact poke through on occasion, and the overall surface feel is ""lumpy"" sometimes.I'm spending what I need to now: This amount on a single feather pillow."
5,Birds of Fire,"Although The Inner Mounting Flame is widely thought to be the best Mahavishnu Orchestra album, I prefer this one. The compostions are more varied and interesting. Also this is a better first purchase for neophytes due to the comparitively restrained playing and stronger compositions. These are petty comments though every Mahavishu Orchestra album from the 70's is essential, this is just the best place to start."
5,with the fire birds a swirling,"you thought mr jan hammer was only around for the cool clean pleated linen and soothing lucre of miami vice?tsk, tsk.."
3,If You're Thinking of Upgrading Your Old Copy...,"...Don't. This 2000 remaster is no better than the original from the 80's. In fact, if you still have the vinyl and a turntable, you're probably better off than those of us with the CD's. I was so disappointed with the sound quality of this remaster that I removed ""The Inner Mounting Flame"" from my wish list. I'll wait until someone remasters these right."
5,Simply the Best,"This record is an encyclopedia of everything that has ever been done in almost every genre, style, or time period of Western music, with a few other things from the Eastern ones as well, all rolled into one. Bartok, Satie, Sibelius; Howlin' Wolf, The Byrds, Leo Kottke; Hamza el Din, Sabicas, and an army of Balinese gamelan players; and JIMIJIMIJIMI and 'TRANETRANETRANE. They're all here, in this musical ""Finnegans Wake.""I was priviledged to see these people on this tour; they played for 3.5 hours -- no breaks. 1.5 hours of the show consisted of McLaughlin's jackhammer solos, during which he seemed to be reading the minds of every guitarist in the massive audience, coming up with all the licks they could only wish they could play. I can still remember, note for note, specific licks that he never put on record. What more can be said?"
3,I feel kinda let down,"I loved The Inner Mounting Flame and was looking to find the next step in the evolution of Mahavishnu. I found that in Birds of Fire, but unfortunately, I don't really like where it headed. Overall, the music in this album seems really unfocused, like they had a few good ideas and just threw them all together onto an album, but didn't really feel like taking the time to develop them to their potential. The title track is excellent though, almost makes the whole album worth it. ""Hope"" sounded like a good theme that they just couldn't find any use for, so they just repeated it a bunch of times and made it a track. Everything else comes across a bit droning and fails to keep my attention. The three stars are for the display of musicianship that the band never fails to get across; the lack of five stars is because the band just doesn't seem to be working together on this album. Give it a shot, if you want, you might pull out more from this album than I did."
3,"""The Inner Mounting Flame"" is much better","The Mahavishnu Orchestra is still doing good work, but they have lost some of their power and creativity, and their playing becomes weary, so the single pieces are shorter than in the previous album. Sometimes they just repeat phrases (""Sanctuary""), but the recording has some very beautiful and impressive minutes, for example ""Thousand Islands Park""."
5,"Speed metal, before there was speed metal","I am a metal fan, first and foremost, but have been checking out other types of music for a while. I've heard that this band featured great musicians, namely Billy Cobham and John McGlaughlin, so I decided it would be a good purchase. I AM BLOWN AWAY BY THIS ALBUM!!! This must have influenced some of my favorite metal bands, like Megadeth and Metallica in their most productive years. Mahavishnu takes you on a roller coaster ride through jazz fusion, much like a Metallica song like ""Master of Puppets"" does. An awesome listening experiance for anyone listening to top notch musicianship and energetic songs."
3,Transcendent Music; Horrible Remix (get the original mix),"First of all, the music here is unique, inventive, and INTENSE (spiritually and volume-wise). To any curious parties, you owe it to yourself to have: this CD, The Inner Mounting Flame (their first), and The Lost Trident Sessions (their long-lost third studio album).The music is beyond five stars.Now, for those of you who have heard this album before, avoid this remastered version like the plague. The original mix was tinny and thin, but gave a good overall impression. Bob Belden's remix overemphasizes lead instruments to the point of distorting them and ruining their timbre. On the title track, you can barely hear the drums, bass and rhythm ostinato.If you have the CD of the original mix, keep it and be happy.If you have a good sounding copy in another format (vinyl or cassette), make an MP3 CD...."
3,Eye Candy For A Boring Night,"Please forgive me, but I really was disappointed with this film. It is is over-rated, unsure of it's direction and horribly acted. Considering that it is chock full of music, it's embarrasing to hear the main cast's inability to sing on key. It is pure eye candy with a pychotic mix of old and new songs to 'somehow' give it a new-age gravity that just doesn't work. I expected Paul McCartney's ""Silly Love Songs"" to pop up at any moment. The art direction is actually fascinating for the first half-hour, but becomes tedious and nearly dizzying in it's busy flash and spin choreography. The editors seemed to have fun, but the final result is nauseating. I just cannot understand how this film recieved so many Oscar nominations, other than for it's extreme perspective on filmaking."
4,5-HTP Decisions,"Regarding the previous two reviews, each has merit. The bottom line is that both books offer considerable information on the benefits of 5-HTP. For many it is proving to be a viable solution to the conditions that plague so many. Sahelian's book offers clear cut information that is easy to understand. My sister has taken 5-HTP for a while now and is seeing great improvement without suffering from the side effects of the SSRI she had been on previously. A site where she has had great service as well as a variety of product choices is iHerb. She is pleased that they offer several choices of 5-HTP with dosages as low as 50 mg. so she could initially start with a low dosage and then find what works best for her."
4,Wonderful online review,"I have been researching 5-HTP for some time, and using the web as a vital resource. When evaluating books on the subject, this one came highly rated by an online review by Steven Wm. Fowkes, Sr. Director of the Cognitive Enhancement Research Institute (CERI):http://www.ceri.com/rev-sero.htmI recommend anyone considering reading a book on 5-HTP to examine this review first. I would publish it here, but for the copyright considerations. Cheers!"
3,"5-HTP is great, but this book doesn't present it very well","I have used 5-HTP and it worked great for me; I had immediate and lasting better quality sleep and improved mood that far surpassed the ssri drugs. But the book is really wishy-washy when it comes down to the personal comments from users; the comments are poorly worded, sometimes have no bearing on 5-HTP, and leave the reader wondering if this supplement really has any value. A junior in high school could of written a better book. Get the Michael Murray, ND book instead, it is definitely the best book out there."
3,"Good pillow, but a little crunchy","I purchased this pillow for my nine year old son. It offers just the right amount of support for him. I was disappointed in the crunchiness of the feather down and almost returned them. My son liked them anyway, so we decided to keep them. I am still searching for the right pillow in the meantime."
2,hmmm,I think I would stick to costco for my feather pillow needs. At least I can return it easily if I don't liek it.
3,It's Okay,"I was glad there was a selection of colors. Not everyone likes the stone washed blue denim. The peak was too flimsy; however, a lot of spray starch solved the problem."
1,Broken During Shipping,"This review is to advise of a packing issue. The electrical component is on the bottom part of the rails and when boxed, hits the bottom where the packer failed to include any packing material. This caused the hard plastic cover to crack and break, leaving the wires exposed and disassembling the on/off soft plastic switch, rendering the product unusable and unsafe for use.Amazon's handling of the return was ACES. They provided a free return shipping label, and processed the credit within a couple days...keeping me apprised of each step via e-mail. TOP NOTCH SERVICE...very important in my book!"
3,"Good towel dryer, but not warmer","I read the reviews and knew going in that this was a good towel dryer and not necessarily the best warmer, but that's what I wanted--a towel dryer. I have no vent in my bathroom and just needed to get the towels and air dry to prevent mold, cut down and laundry etc. so I thought I didn't care. However, now experiencing the tiny warm spot where the towel has touched the bar, makes me wish I would have gone for the more robust version that actually warms the towels. That warm part is soooo nice, but too small. I have to say though, that it's great for getting the towels dry quickly!I also went with this version because it fit in the small space I had on the floor. With long towels though, it's better to put it on the wall and in that case I could have gone with a bigger model that perhaps would have warmed better. So basically, don't limit yourself on size if you think you want it on the floor. You'll probably mount it on the wall in the end anyway."
3,"Works fine, but watch out for the bare metal sides","Thsi towel warmer does a good job of keeping towels warm, and drying clothes. Also, the price was good and the quality of the warmer is good. It seems sturdy and hopefully will last awhile. But the side rails are quite hot if you touch them and cause a mild burn to delicate skin such as on small children. Since you hang items on the horizontal rails it would have been nice if they put a protective covering on the 2 vertical rails to prevent the mild burns. They are on the outside of the warmer so are very easy to accidentally touch."
3,Drying Rack is a better name for it.,It is better to market it as a drying rack rather than a towel warmer. I am not at all impressed with its towel warming performance. Very mediocre performance. I had seen towel warmers in European homes and that is where I learnt about them first time and had been looking for them here.They were real towel warmers and the whole towel would be real warm. This one is a joke for a towel warmer. May be as a clothes dryer it will do a better job!!!
4,Maybe not in the garage,PROS: Very easy to set up both on legs and on wall. Heats up fast.I set it up in my garage to warm up jackets before going out snowblowing and to dry towels after boating in the summer. In winter in the garage it doesn't warm jackets up very much even though the bars are very warm. I'm looking forward to trying it in the summer.
2,not all that warm,"I have wanted a towel warmer for a long time. I was rather disappointed in this one. The towels do have a few warm spots-but they are overall not very warm. To get the warm spots you have to layer them on the rack and it is more trouble than it is worth in the long run. By the time you dig to the bottom to get your ""warm"" towel while you are dripping wet-the warm towel is kind of pointless."
1,Not Warm Enough,"The unit delivered does not heat the towels enough - almost no heat at all. I will check with the manufacturer to see if anything can be done. If all are like this one, I would never recommend that anyone buy one."
2,Stopped working after one month,I was quite happy with this unit. I did not have it on a timer and did not turn it off and on more than 10 times. After about 1 month of use it completely stopped heating. I am trying to return it on the 1 year warranty directly back to warmrails. Beware.
4,exceeded expectations,This arrived in a very timely manner;we opted to mount it to the wall in our bathroom and it is surpassing our expectations. We find it just the right addition to the masterbath.It allows you to feel you are having a spa experience all the time. we recommend it. We have never had a slow delivery or a mistake ordering though Amazon.
4,Great value for the price,"We live on the coast so our towels were always damp. I read the reviews on the Warmrails models and people seemed to be very satisfied or not satisfied at all. Obviously, the more you pay for towel warmers, the warmer the towels but for this price our towels are dry and not cold and that was all we really wanted. The support feet were very sturdy and we later easily mounted the unit on the wall. The towels do need to be folded and draped fully over the rails for best drying."
2,A little disapointing,This CD was disapointing because it only included five selections from Les Mis. In addition the selctions were shortened versions of each song. The quailty of the music was ok and it was easy to sing along with.
3,Incomplete Selection,"This CD was sadly very disappointing to me and my young son, who loves singing the songs of Les Miz. The information failed to state that there were only seven songs from the musical. I was made to expect all the songs from Les Miz, as nowhere was the word ""selections from.."" printed. This should have been specified, so as not to disappoint the buyers. The recording was quite excellent, but gravely incomplete. Had this been included int the information, there will be less such incidences. There are around 30 songs in the full recording, and so to have only 7 of them should be worth mentioning."
2,You get what you pay for...,"This is a flimsily built CD player that sounds weak. It lacks the dynamics that a quality player puts out, especially with the included headphones. With more efficient headphones, the sound is a bit louder, but still lacks any punch or excitement. To make things worse, this unit does not have AUDIO OUTPUT, so you can't even connect to a heftier power source. If you don't care about quality audio, this one may be for you since it is cheap. But if you do care, get a better one."
4,out put from the source,the performance of this product is really good but out put of the music is not as good as i expected. May be a better earphones will do the job.
2,dejection: a review,"While I was initially attracted to this product for the sterling glamour of its silvery surface, this soon tarnished once I began operating its more than yielding button interface. Yes, it is very generous in how it allows you to press and poke it to command a number of operations; but it is almost too generous, and with each push of a button it sinks into disrepute, servility and debasement. I once esteemed its silvery resplendence. This product now impresses me as nothing more than painted chattel to be abused by paupers and mendicants, to daub with their oily fingers.I can have no more of this disreputable product."
3,Dual purpose portability,Both MP3 and CDs capability reduces the need for separate players. Only negative is battery consumption.
2,not a solid item,"I didn't like it, first I asked for a nano ipod holder and when I send the sellers a mail asking if my nano will fit, they never answer... now I have it and of course is to big to hold my ipod nano... it isn't for ""all ipods"" like the web said, and it isn't a solid item also it brokes easily."
3,Vent Clips Are Not Sturdy,"I got this in December, and by February the vent clips had come apart. I then epoxyed the clips back together and got another 4 months out of them, but now it's June and they're broken again. No damage to my ipod thank goodness, but I expected a longer life from those clips than 6 months. I should say it was a great 6 months, while it lasted."
4,GOOD item works well.,"I don't even have an IPOD I actually have a creative zen photo and it fits just fine. It is adjustable and pretty universal and I am happy with this product, it serves its purpose and has 2 ways of mounting it, either in the vent or with the sticky adhesive."
2,In Cold Temperatures - Won't Stick,Great design but unfortunately wouldn't stay stuck in cold temperatures - I have a Saturn and the vent clip was not an option for me.
2,...was hoping for something a little more durable...,"Loved the idea of being able to clip the iPod mount to the dash vents - unfortunately the execution of this concept was lacking in this product - the clips held to the vents - but they fell off the back of the mount.We have gone with plan ""B"" and used the self adhesive mount directly on the dash. Sticks well - but can't see the iPod once it is in the mount. Well - at least we can keep out eyes on the road with one less distraction."
2,Nano IPod,"Does not hold the Nano IPod as I thought , consequently it did not work for me.Nyko Universal Car Mount for all iPods"
2,What Happened To The Show!?,"These episodes stink! From super funny & cool to BO-RING! The 1st episode is about a deul between Nuku Nuku & Ms.Cheiko over a fried noodle bun (wow, what a plot). While they're deuling, Mishima is trying to find a ""secret agent"" who's destroying their plans to take over the world (you won't believe who they thought it was). In the next episode (which I REALLY hated) is when Ryunosuke drinks a DNA Changer that Dr.Ohizumi made & turns him into an alligator (now that's a stupid plot). The last special episode is when Nuku Nuku thinks she's been dumped by the Natsume's on New Years (the only interesting episode). It actually reveals some of her past. It's not that I hate this show now, it's just this volume absolutely stunk! I would say save your money! Mee-ow!"
5,Fantastic,"The magic chelf is fantastic. If it doesn't work, I would suggest that you might not have put it up correctly. I have 3 and they have worked well for over 3 years. In addition, I move moved them and they still work great. It it were available I would buy several more. They make great gifts too."
5,still great after 2 years,I bought one of these shelves 2 years ago b/c we moved into a new house w/ a cultured marble shower that had no built-in shelving/ledges. It still works great and I'm kicking myself for not buying more sooner. I can't find these ANYWHERE (many search hits but all have been dead-end links).
1,Garbage with Customer Support to Match,"I could not register this product because I have ie7 and they can't work with ie7, I have called their support phone number (toll call) and they told me to uninstall ie7. Other software that I have had difficulties with ie7, but they fixed the problem, not try to make me unstall ie7! I can't get the product to work and I can't get any support from them!"
4,Drums and Jazz!,"In 1958 I bought Cozy Cole's singles of Topsy, Part 2 (& 1) and Turvy, Part 2 (& 1). I've had those two singles for almost 50 years. I saw this CD on Amazon.com and had to have it. There are some gems here that I've never heard by Cozy before, Sandy Nelson's ""Let There Be Drums,"" for one. If you like jazz and drums then this is for you."
3,More of historical interest,"I recall Topsy from when I was a kid. This album has that and more but the cuts seem repetitious and compared to more preeminent drummers, not all that great."
5,Wonderfull rack!,I love it. Great feelling warm towels for small price (compare with other similar products)
1,"I loved the concept, but it actually scorched my towels","I purchased a Warmrails and just installed it in the bathroom I just remodeled. I used it for 3 days and LOVED it until I started noticing yellow ""stains"" on my towels. I took down a large bathsheet I had on the top rack and found brown scorch marks - the towel smelled like cotton does when you leave an iron on it and scorch it. I don't know if I have a defective model, I purchased it on Amazon, and will be contacting the company. I would absolutely replace it if it turns out to be a defective unit and not a ""feature"" of the product."
4,seems good for the price,"This shelf towel warmer is a little large for my small bathroom, but it is a welcome addition, nevertheless. I expect that I will appreciate it most when the house heat goes off in the spring; that's when I have the most trouble w/ my towels drying promptly."
1,towel rack a bust,"Nice idea, but marginal performance. We had this thing running all day and it minimally warmed towels, even though the shelf itself was clearly warm to the touch. If you want something other than just a place to store towels, then this is not for you."
3,Towel Warmer/Dryer,"The product looks nice. It does warm the towel on the lower shelf, but the bar where you hang your wet towel does not heat--how could it--your towel is hanging. I should have realized this; but, no problem. Just stick that towel (along with your pjs) on the shelf when you shower."
3,Just like the other reviews,This product works fine just like the other reviews mention. After leaving the towel on the rack it becomes moderately warm after 3-4 hours. Leaving it on overnight like the directions say only makes the towel slightly warmer but seems wasteful. The unit uses 68 watts according to my Kill-A-Watt so it like leaving a household light on 24/7. I have mine plugged into a standard light timer to come on 3 hours before I shower and off an hour afterwards. This seems like the best compromise for warmth and drying of the towel.
5,LOVING IT!,"My towels are now not only dry, but gently warm, not hot. Perfect for that little bit of extra luxury! I fold them up into 3 or 4 layers right after the shower, and they are always dry and ready to use again the next morning. No more damp towels!!!"
2,Not worth the money.,"I bought this for my wife for her birthday. It is very heavy for a towel rack. I had trouble installing it with the wall anchors it came with. I ended up having to go to the hardware store and buy heavy duty drywall anchors. Once I did that, installation was easy. I have given this a low rating because it takes it a long time to warm a towel. Not only does it take a long time, but it is barely even noticeable. My wife says she loves it, but I get the feeling she is just being nice. This one was the highest rated for the price based upon customer reviews, so I am guessing no one has figured out how to make a cheap towel warmer that works well. I would avoid this product."
2,"Looks good, it works as towel warmer, but it does not dry","I installed 2 of those shelves in my bathrooms. The polished brass looks very good. It work relatlively well as a towel warmer. However, it does not dry towels very well. This is more a practical issue. A shelf is very good to place already dry towels to be warmed, but it is a bad design to places towels to dry. For me, now it is too late, but if you want your towels not only warm, but also dry, I would recomend you to buy one of the stand up models instead. Those should work fine."
1,False advertising,This is a carefully crafted bait and switch. The actual toner cartridge received is NOT a HP but a recycled unit which makes it worth MUCH less as recycled units tend to print less than half the amount of pages. The box is an innovera brand NOT the HP box shown on the products listing. What you ship MUST be what you described and this is NOT.
5,Excellent series,This season like all other seasons were excellent since I was catching up on the previous years and had missed some of the episodes from this season.
1,This classifies as Newsies?,"Let me start by saying that Newsies is my favourite movie and has been since it first came out in 1992. I had always regreted not buying the CD when it was availible, so I decided to give this Karaoke CD a shot. I was shocked, repulsed, and more disappointed with a CD then I have ever been before IN MY LIFE. This CD is completely untrue to the movie's real music. I don't even know where to begin- the songs aren't even named the same on this CD! Let me assure you that the music from Newsies is *without a doubt* worth a 5-star rating, however, this Karaoke version is disgraceful. If you want the Newsies soundtrack, I suggest you look for one at an online auction or something, and DO NOT SETTLE for this appalling, piece of trash no-good fraud of a CD. It does not live up to the real Newsies sound."
1,Newsies - Sing-A-Long Karaoke,This CD was very disappointing. I throughly enjoy the music from the musical Newsies. The Karaoke CD does not do the songs justice. During several songs the performers seem to take on their own harmonizing tryouts. I thought that there would be less singing loudly more softer undertones so that the music could be heard clearly and the performer had the room to express their vocal talents.
2,Newsies Lovers--Beware!,"I got this sing-a-long because I am a big fan of Newsies!It was not very impressive. The sing-a-long has five instrumental tracks and five reference vocals tracks. As a fan of Newsies, the reference tracks really irritated me because the singers sound awful and nothing like the actors in the movie.A couple of the titles of the songs are even incorrect [And I, as a hardcore Newsies fan, was appalled].""Carryin' the Banner"" is called ""It's A Fine Life""""The World Will Know"" has an added ""And"" in front of the title [Not a big deal, but it just irritates me a little]and ""King of New York"" has an added ""The"" before it [again, not a big deal].The CD just kind of irritated me. Don't bother. Buy the real soundtrack!"
1,Does it seem stupid?,Does it seem stupid to anyone else that you can buy this karoke version but you can't buy the real thing? It doesn't make very much sense to me.
2,Not worth it,"If you want something like the movie, then don't get this. The singers have awful accents and annoying voices. The only good part is the blank music tracks (no words) which you can sing along with."
4,gossamer wings sheer drapes,"don't waste your time in ironing them, they will stay wrinkled but they look great..."
4,Interesting but needs help if it is used in the classroom,"This book does a great job of discussing merger planning and implementation issues in what seems to be a very practical way. It is well written. Howvever, I have used this book in a graduate class with very mixed results. Because it is so narrowly focused, it fails to discuss the wide variety of other issues that need to be addressed such as valuation, deal structuring, tax issues, payment issues, closing gaps in buyer-seller expectations, effective negotiating techniques, etc. This are very real issues that I face in my current profession. Winning at Mergers really needs a companion text which effectively addresses many of these issues. The best I have read are Depamphilis' book Mergers, Acquisitions, and other Restructuring Activities and Hook's Practical Guide to doing the Deal. When used with a text the quality of these, Winning at Mergers can be a very good book in the classroom."
2,Not realistic - not practical,"I've spent nearly 20 years doing mergers and acquisitions. I keep up with all the M&A books on the market. First off, the basic content here is good and its difficult to disagree with the ideas. But, mostly they are just ideas. If you tried to do everything the authors talk about it would take forever to get anything done, if you ever got a deal done. Some things sound good in theory but don't pass muster in the real world. This book is like that. Its hard to believe the authors have much real world experience, because so much of what they recommend lacks the ring of practicality."
1,not good,The author wastes way too many words on the religious views of David Koresh. Who cares about that? Religion is nonsense in any form. I wanted much more about the government's malfeasance.
1,Koresh Had Enough Illegal Weapons For Kosovo's Next Revolution!!!,"It is always amusing for me to come across yet another attempt at 'Rewriting Koresh History'. The author conveniently overlooks THE FACT that David Koresh used women and innocent children as 'Human Shields' from the proper authorities. He also neglects to mention that keeping children locked up for 51 days without any decent food, running water , heat or electricity was CHILD ABUSE on a Grand Scale.I also thought his profile of Marc Breault was most misleading when Mr. Beault accomplished more in saving Koresh's followers than anybody else involved in this scenario. I do believe that this book should be sold in the 'Fiction 'section of any bookstore."
4,Winny,"Here's another example of the sadly over-looked talent that should be outselling Britney Spears, yet somehow isn't. I initially bought this CD due to the strange coincedence that she looks remarkably like someone I went to HS with, in Europe. Worked out fairly well too. This is an excellent cd. Ellie's crafting is poppy, without being overly sweet, and her voice is haunting, and quite beautiful. She covers a range of strange subjects, but mostly it listens like a series of situation portraits. Slice of life, I guess. Love is an occasional subject, as is friendship, displacement and peace. Like the cover looks, it's a collage. Hopefully she'll get some acclaim soon."
4,Great!,"Timely and lived up to my expectations. What more could you want? They were a little bit smaller than what I had thought, but not a big deal."
2,molds,bought to make bath bombs should have read it candy mold was too fragile to make the bath fizzies oh well
4,Nice mold,"Fairly strong and will reuse for parties, making candies for cake toppings, etc. I'm an amateur cake baker for friends and do seaside and nautical themes.....will use again"
4,Sound not a problem.,I've had this phone for a few weeks and I haven't had any problems with it yet. The sound is perfectly clear. The only complaints I have are related to the Verizon software which is counterintuitive and insists having two ugly red bars at the top and bottom of the screen.
1,This phone is a POS,"I have had this phone for about six months. It is the worst phone I've ever had bar none. I frequently have trouble with reception in the middle of the large city where I live. The charger doesn't quite fit into the port, so it's really hard to get it to charge. The buttons are flat which makes it impossible to text message or even dial. The one good feature is the camera which is pretty standard nowadays. Save yourself a whole bunch of money and DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!!"
2,Not a good phone,"I got this phone from Amazon and after using it for couple days I am sending it back. I have only one major complain about this phone that forced me to return it. Sound quality is truly awful. The phone adds heavy distortion which make it difficult to understand other party in a conversation. There is a constant background made of hissing sounds. Finally, the volume is too high even at the lowest setting and because I have sensitive hearing this phone is just painful to use. I think I am going to get a Nokia instead."
2,KEEP looking....,"[...]The construction is very cheap. It feels really flimsy; when it rings, it feels like it is on vibrate mode. Call quality is poor. Camera quality is real bad. The number buttons are spaced really close such that you hit adjacent buttons all the time when dialing [...] The speakerphone button is on the outside and somehow I am always hitting it. Menu navigation is not as intuitive as the a670.On the PRO side, it is smaller and lighter than the a670. Also, the antenna is internalzied so nothing is sticking out.in summary, skip over this phone. i know i am..."
4,A good phone for a reasonable price,"This phone looks much better than its pictures and has basic but good functions, which is good for users like me who need just a decent phone. Both speakerphone and speaker sound clear and loud, which I like a lot. One problem for me is that I cannot see clock in standby mode, and I need to press any button to see clock."
5,Ghost Whisperer 4,"I absolutely love this show! I watched it every night that it came on every week! I already have the first three seasons and can't wait until I can get the 5th season. It gets sad in this season because Jim dies and then he jumps into someone else's body so he won't have to leave Melinda. It takes a while for Jim to remember who he is because he's in Sam's body and Sam has to die all over again for him to become Jim again, even though he looks like Sam. Melinda finds out that she's pregnant and eventually Melinda and Jim/Sam get married again and it's great for them too to have a second chance at love!"
5,"Ghost Whisperer, Season 4, ""Endless Love""","Believing that the Ghost Whisperer series provided Realistic impressions of what a person who is Spiritually Gifted could experience, I have loved every episode I have watched. You know, people become very attached to the people they love in their life. Sometimes, after death, the attachment remains as strong as it was in life and can even take on the same Reality as in life. This episode deals with this type of attachment.Endless Love"
1,This season is the worst one so far.,I have watched this show since the beginning and this is by far the worst one so far. If they wanted to kill Jim off they should have just killed him and let him cross over. I have not watched anymore of this season since he took over that guys body.
2,Histrionic Personality d/o,"I have watched 3 seasons and now the fourth of this series. I do not like and find disturbing that The lead actress hangs out with a Psychology Professor and while they attempt to address other peoples woes and sorrows, nothing is said or directed to the obvious d/o of the lead actress and I do not mean ghost whispering. Ms. Hewitt's character while suffering with histrionic Personality d/o is all in the audience's face. Why has not the ""brain professor,"" addressed this? Ms Hewitt's character can be seen wearing off the shoulder and strapless breast exposed, while attending a funeral and sequins and crinoline lined satin dresses at the work place in the morning. I do not know if this is the characters' personality or the actress, but it is indeed a little sick."
4,Branching Out,This season's Ghost Whisperer to me was a different way of approaching the show. With Jim getting killed it shows the viewer of the wide scope of acting amongst the entire cast. Each episode is STILL quite worth watching and I think always will be due to the cast and the writers. I recommend this product highly for anyone that is a fan of the show.
5,Ghost Whisperer Season 4,Wonderful how things can turn well for melinda and Jim!! Cannot wait for the season 5 to go out on DVD.
3,I loved this band,"I'm Susan Holbrook, drummer for this band from its inception in 1994 until early 1997. This cd was the final release featuring the original lineup and represents the culmination of most of the ideas we had when we first formed the band. Most of the tracks were recorded in Memphis during Elvis Week 1996, with the addition of a few personal 4-track recordings contributed by the two main songwriters, Bryan Ciliberto and Bryan Terry. Our week in Memphis ultimately proved to be a grueling experience for the band, but a lot of musical growth was acheived in the process. It was like childbirth in many ways. This is also an extrememly personal record, and I hope anyone who purchases it does so with an open mind and soul. There are a lot of influences to digest here, but all are wrapped up in great melodies and hooks- no matter what the genre.In short, this cd represents a time in my life that I look back on with great fondness. This is the butterflies. -Susan"
4,LAMPS PLUS Walnut Window Pane Table Lamp,Excellent price for this lamp. I saw it in the stores for over twice what I paid online. It arrived in two boxes (one for the lamp and one for the shade). Incredible packing! Totally protected. Bubble wrapped and protected with a factory-full of styrofoam peanuts! We are very pleased with the lamp. It is in our living room and coordinates very well with the rest of our furniture.
4,Played more for laughs,"Unlike Sorcerer Hunters where the humor plays around the edges of the plot, this one seems like the gags were dreamed up first. My almost 12-yr-old wanted this one for months before I bought it. There's a lot of familiar voice actors(ADV studio-Andrew Klimko/Sorcerer Hunters-Gateau) & Kelly Manison/S.H.-Big Mama, Martian Successor Nadesico-Haruka, Excel-Great Will of the Macroverse. Japanese actors Tomokazu Seki/M.S.Nadesico-Gai Daigoji, Card Captor Sakura-Toya, X-Kamui & Kotono Mitsushi/Sailor Moon-Usagi, Excel Saga-Excel, Blue Seed-Kome. They even got DBZ's Bulma-Hiromi Tsuru on ep 12) so the whole thing comes off pretty well. I found the plot a bit thin--or maybe just a poor excuse to strip characters' clothes off almost every ep, but I did laugh quite a bit."
2,Waste of time and money,"I have to wonder if the reviewers that gave this DVD a good rating saw the same one I did. The animation is cheesy, the comedy is beyond lame, and the characters are downright annoying. The basic idea is great and it's a shame it was handled so poorly. The shows look like half the scenes were chopped out and what remained was cut to the bare bone. I'd have given it one star except that I reserve that rating for truly horrendous examples of defective wares foisted on an unsuspecting public. My advice? Spend your money elsewhere."
5,"Wit and Elven Nudity, What more do you want?","While the title may brand it a bit risque, this anime is actually pretty tame. Well tame in the sense there aren't really a bunch of naked elves running around. This series' wit and humor make it a classic and a must own for anyone who truely enjoys both anime and a good laugh. Between a bigheaded fighter, a militant teenager, an actress who is almost too smart, and an elven leader forced to live out the series in the body of a dog you really can't go wrong. And the whole stripping every elf they come across thing helps too. So pick it up and remember that there is a Those Who Hunt Elves 2 that will be released as well."
4,Awesome first set!!,"I bought this set with no idea what to expect. I have watched a little bit of Anime before, but I wasn't ever really impressed. Needless to say, this one definitely got me hooked. The story line is somewhat out of the ordinary...and the humor is great! I totally love Junpei! He is hilarious!!The only reason this one got 4 stars instead of five is the opening song/music. It is repeated throughout the DVD (particularly at the main title and at the beginning and end of every episode). I fell asleep watching the DVD one day and woke up with that annoying little tune in my head all day....but other than the opening song, I would recommend this set to all my family and friends. Sure, there is talk of stripping of elves, but there isn't any real nudity basically meaning you can't see anything you would see with clothes on.Bottom line...get the set. You won't be sorry."
1,A complete waste,"I agree completely with NY's comments. This is a terrible waste of time. This is more ""conspiracy theory"" than anything else."
5,Best Ambient Sound You'll Ever Hear...It's From The Heavens,"The Euphoria series have defintely become the best series of trance mixes and this is no different...It is simply the best yet. The only difference is that this is the kind of music you can relax to, chill out to and make love to...Ok! I think I'm being carried away...but if you don't believe me buy this compilation (you won't be disappointed) and listen to it at night, by a quiet beach and just gaze at the stars and look onto the ocean...Feel the sea breeze brushing against your skin and smell the freshness of the air...You Are In Heaven...That is where this compilation takes you.There are brilliant mixes here and I should mention Chicane, Delerium & Olive as amongst the best...Join us in the Ambient Heaven...It's free to all!!! Buy it!!!"
4,"Great organization building book, but not related to Chaos","Overall, I think this is a great book about organization building. It mainly talks about how you can change an organization. You need to face the challenge of ""shared vision"", ""corporate culture"", and ""goverance"". As a change agent, you need to improve your personal leadership/personal mastery, relationship and dialogue with others.The reason I only give it 4-star is because I can't find a strong link between all these great lessons and Chaos/Complexity/Quantum. I think all these lessons exist everywhere in all great organization building book.Net, I recommend this book to anyone who are interested in organization building, but not about Chaos/complexity theory, etc."
2,Some good insights in a miasma of thought.,"While there are some good insights into human nature and life in this book, it is such a distraction when an author litters their ideas with leftist dogma. If you are going to refer to economic phenomena, you should understand what you are writing."
4,Worked.,4 stars for 2 reasons. What I received is not what is pictured. Set screw to secure TV to mount once its hung is only accessable with a very long screw driver. Still worth the price.
4,My Second Heart,"I liked reading the male perspective of romance, kind of rare among novels about relationships.Good development of characters. You really made them come alive.Also, the twists to the plot were effective; they caught me off guard.Nice first book!"
1,"Garbage in, garbage out","Picked this up at a used record store and thought I had stumbled on ""gold Jerry gold."" Fools gold at best. I didn't like it the 1st time I played it and threw in the sale bin. Thinking I was too harsh, I played it again. From start to finish it's one of the worst albums I've ever heard."
4,"Fun album, in spite of it all.","As a fan of all three performers, I was surprised I'd never heard of this. While I agree with many reviewers that this isn't the best work of any of the performers involved, it's still a solid album, and perfect for a summer evening on the porch with a few cold ones. I know it was supposed to be a group effort, but the record could have used a little more Dr. John (but then, so could a lot of records, I guess)."
1,Much too expensive for this book !,"The book is a gentle reminder to help treasure the people in your life.However, the cost of this book is a contradiction to the advice the words inside the book has to offer...........I, myself would not pay $ 39.95, for this book.Sorry to say, its a rip-off.CaroleCoos Bay, Oregon7-27-07"
2,"Cost of this book, is too much","Lynn in Texas (review) is right, this book "" If Only I Knew "", is a rip-off$12.95 is expensive enough, now $30.00 ! No one could even enjoy the messages in the book, knowing they got ripped off. What a shame, to pay so much, don't do it......Sorry, the book has wonderful thoughts, but not for the price.CaroleCoos Bay, Oregon"
3,Quite late delivery!,"It took ten days from I ordered this book to got it, since I ordered the 2-day delivery."
2,Skip this if you already live in the Rockies,"First let me say the quality of this is first rate, publishing and writing. However, for someone who lives in Denver and the heart of the Rockies I was very disappointed.Buy this book if 1.) You do NOT live in or near the Rockies. 2.) You are NOT ""savvy"" reading recreational atlas maps, AAA Guides, or using the Internet or Google Earth.I guess I simply had higher expectations for rides in ""my backyard"". There are only 6 trips in Colorado. Three are based out of Georgetown and three out of Durango. If you live near these areas I guarantee you probably have already ridden these rides. Looking at other areas I have ridden, (Grand Canyon, S. Utah, etc.), most of the rides are common sense easily inferred my looking at a map or if you subscribe to a magazine like ""Road Runner"" you probably already have the info.Again, high quality, but ""locals"" beware. The ""Grand Loop"" section is great if you a month+ vacation to tour ALL of the Rockies."
2,actually more of a booket than a book,"Besides being such a small book my 8 year old daughter was insulted and thought I had ordered a ""baby book"" for her. We home school so I am not sure when this would match public school grades but I would guess this booklet is better for a 4-6 or maybe a 7 year old.For a lesson that a child will be more interested in and retain longer use a more fun and interactive way of grouping and counting such as colored jelly beans or m&m;'s and things that are tangible...and as a reward they can eat them at the end of the lesson."
3,MAT 146 Review,"I am a Pima College student, majoring in Elementary Education. I read The Grapes of Math, to a resource room class, during their math hour. The students in the class were grade first through fifth. The kids thought that the riddles were silly, but did not understand that they were supposed to answer the riddles. Most of the students were not familiar with the math terms that were used in the book, and I had to explain the vocab to them for each riddle. I really enjoyed the book, but I would recommend that it be used for 5th or 6th grade classrooms."
4,A good book for making math literacy facile,"The Grapes Of Math by Gregory Tang and Harry Briggs has one genre of math problems presented in an amusing fashion with good art. The genre is patterns of objects with breaks in the patterns. The children are expected to look at the patterns as groupings or shapes to figure out the total number of objects without counting one-by-one.This is a good book. The kids like it. The problems are amusing, even bordering on tickling. My only problem with this book is that an overview of methods for solving the problems should be at the beginning. But so what? There are a few ways to look at the problems and the kids actually sit down to do them without being pestered.Let me repeat this: after the initial disappointment that I had purchased math books, on their own the kids actually sat down to do the problems without being pestered. If this isn't an endorsement, then what is?"
5,"More Riddles, Patterns, and Problem Solving","This great book provides the opportunity for children to enjoy mental math challenges. The riddles guide the reader to the author's solution. However, our son enjoyed looking for patterns and using his own clever ideas to quickly solve the problems. I gave this book to my six year old son the summer before he began second grade. He loved the rhymes and the pictures. He especially liked finding clever ways to count the objects without counting one by one. We made a family game of solving each riddle, working to see who would solve it first. Then we shared our strategies and reviewed the author's strategy which is presented in the back of the book.I highly recommend this book! It provides good mental math practice in a fun way. It also reinforces the fact that there are many ways to solve a problem. Gifted children love patterns. This book builds on that and helps them to see additional ways in which finding patterns could be useful."
5,Grapes of Math,Love this book because I like to regroup and think differently like the book shows. Have used with my students.
5,The Grapes of Math: A New Way of Counting,"I am currently a student at Pima Community College in Tucson, Arizona. I read this book to a third grade student and she loved it! The Grapes of Math has wonderful bright colored pictures that are great for kids as well as rhyming which is fun for them. Each page in the book gives different math problems dealing with animals, food, and everyday objects that make it easier for kids to relate to. The book helps gives students hints on different ways of counting.Instead of counting items one by one, the book gives examples of how to group and pair items together. The pictures in the book helped my student to visualize the groupings and it made it much easier for her to figure out the problems in the book. What is also great about this book is that at the end of the book, the author gave the answers to the math problems in the book and ways to explain how to do them. I reccommed this book for elementary age students."
3,Great idea,"This book is wonderful. Finally there are great books that celebrate math!! This is an awesome book for older children. I'd say at least 1st grade (some Kindergartener would really enjoy it). However, done properly, it's too time consuming for a preschooler. My 3 year old, even though he's very bright, could only hang for 3 pages doing it the right way. After that we just kind of made up our own *way*. Don't be discouraged to buy it, though, because no matter what the age, you can never encourage math enough!!! Great book, great buy!!"
4,Not just for kids,"This is a great book for a certain time in a kid's mathematical development, probably somewhere between first and fourth grade. It might be challenging on first read, but could then become a friend to return to again and again as the child matures.Although the book's content is extremely elementary, it illustrates some fundamental ways of thinking about math that can be important at any level, and it presents them in a humorous, friendly way. In particular, the habit of immediately looking for a clever solution to a problem is invaluable. Finding ways to count sets without actually listing their members is also an important skill in more advanced math. To see the value of developing general methods, think of trying to count how many bridge hands there are by listing them one by one.This book gives the reader a taste of how real mathematicians think. And it's fun."
5,whiplash bash ted nugent,"was theretoo see this concert ,bring back great times ,thanks ted ,put this on blue ray please,whiplash bash rocks,so get this one while you can !"
3,Good Book!,Not every dog is a show dog that I get in my shop. People with real every day lives don't want there dogs to be groomed like a show dog. They are just real people that do not have time to do all the work to keep these types of hair cuts. Good book if that is what you are looking for.
5,Must have for all Christians,"This book really woke me up to the voice of Christ in the Psalms. Father Reardon spent years reflecting on the Psalms and that slow, deliberate approach shows in the heart and insights he gives in his book. If you're looking for a jiffy pop approach to Christianity then look else where. If you want to better understand the true importance of the Psalms to Christians then this book is a must have resource."
5,For a deeper look....,"For a deeper look into the Psalms, this is an excellent book. Fr. Patrick shows the reader the presence of Christ in the Psalms, explaining how these poems and songs represent an important part of Christian heritage and teaching. His essays are intelligent and well crafted, while being acessible to both the lay and scholarly reader alike. The essays are also warm and inspiring -- a tall order for any book. This book is an important addition to the library of anyone seeking to understand the Bible more clearly, and to Orthodox Christians especially, it is an invaluable tool, linking the Old and New Testaments, through Christ."
5,More than one could ever hope for,"Christ in the Psalms is a first-class compendium of commentaries on the Bible's prayer book. Moreover, linking commentary with New Testament cites creates a rich repertoire of meditation -- personal or for small groups. The instructions on how to use the book, particularly not to pass quickly one to another, are accurate and meaningful. Written in user-friendly language, this book brings to life in unique ways material worthy of contemplation. Great resource."
2,A Disaster.,"I read the reviews about this product and I was certain the same issue, hair becoming caught in the vent, would not happen to me. I was very wrong.The vent is in a terrible location and after less than 4 uses, even though I consider myself quite capable, the product broke. I spent a long time on the phone trying to get in touch with someone who could replace the product, or refund my money, and I could not. I spent time on the Babyliss website and speaking with people at the Amazon shop where I purchased it, to no avail whatsoever. I ended up throwing the dryer out, and swallowing the losses. I confidently say that I will never purchase another Babyliss product.The entire experience was very unpleasant and frustrating."
4,What expected and more,"What can I say, it took me a couple of goes to dig into the cd, but now I am hooked on it as I knew I would be. It's classic Wild Strawberries. If you like them, you will like this one."
2,Hopeless,"I will be first to admit this is the worst of the Robotech Series...the fact of the matter is a great deal of ambiguity that complete vexes me. First of all, the mecha used by the Southern Cross are pathetic, even the assault choppers. Second, when ""help"" arrives from deep space, they should have more serious technology, ie., the Alpha and Beta fighters. Third, when the Robotech Masters left Tirol, their protoculture levels were terribly low, so low in fact that humanity's levels of protoculture should've torn their invasion fleet to shreds. Alas, no...the Southern Cross continually gets pounded and you get this feeling like Supreme Commander Leonard is the biggest loser on the face of the planet. So, thats my story...I love Macross and the whole Invid storylines much better than this, with Macross being the best of the best! True fans must have all the DVDs coming out, but that doesnt mean we have to like the 2nd series one bit!"
3,Better than they say.,"Southern Cross gets alot of bad reviews. But lets be honest, what could have topped Macross? Not much. Southern Cross had alot to live up to. My view is that SC was a well made animation, and if it would have been a stand alone, it would have been big. This collection is fantastic! The animation is outstanding. I personnally loved SC, the mecha, the Robotech Masters... everything about it was amazing. The battle scenes were great and the story flowed well. The DVD's came with previews of many of my fav animie! Just give it a chance, I'm sure you'll love it."
4,Clever premise,"Jim Munroe's science often falls apart (how did a liquid-covered planet ever develop metallurgy) but his science fiction, which is little more than using a set of narrative tropes to explore the human condition, is top notch. Sam Breen is a twentysomething 'pug' who gets into meaningless, angry fights because he knows that medical technology can fix him up simply. When he decides to go teach English on another planet though, he learns the dark side of modernity; simply learning another native language would be enough to hand the intellectual property of an entire planet over to wealthy earthlings.AYS is a ""marvelous journey"" story, a tour of our world dressed up like another. Munroe explores punk, intellectual property rights, the ""exoticism"" of the Third World and the discontents of the modern world in a clever, often funny and sometimes very tragic book."
4,Not interesting but worth reading.,"This book is transfered from the original paper of Prince & Smolensky in 1993. This book talks a lot of details and backgrounds of Optimality Theory. There are few empirical issues in this book such as syllable or foot structure. It spends most of time to talk a lot about the constraint ranking and factorial typology. If you want to know how OT works well with phonology or prosodic morphology, you'd better read Rene Kager's book. If you are the beginer of phonology and just want to take a look of OT, you'd better choose the Diana Archangeli's book. The footnotes of this book/paper are usually long and a bit hard to read (sometimes almost two third of the page). Of course, OT has changed a lot in the past decade, a lot of constraints in this book are overdue. This book could disapoint those who want to know more OT's works of phonology or in other linguistic areas, but it is absolutely an important one!!!"
2,ok,it seem to be ok i have not used it my spring set up did not work how ever it did seem to be a nice quality
3,Okay Resource,"This is a well organized book of jokes andanecdotes.However, none of it is very fresh or informative.It reads like clip art for speeches. It mayallow a breather to gather thoughtsbut will do little to actually stimulate.A good addition to a reference library, buta well written case study has far more resonanceand applicability."
5,I adored this book.,"One of the more surreal Hino books I have read, The Red Snake is a sensitive portrayal of an innocent child caught up in the midst of his family's insanity and perversion. I was moved by the poem at the beginning even though I'm sure it loses something in the translation, and I was even more entranced as I watched the book unfold and realized that parts of the poem were being echoed in the story. I am very glad I got this book and it may be my favorite book so far among those I have collected in the Hino Horror series. It definitely ranks up there for me next to Panorama of Hell and I think it's somewhat superior to Mystique Mandala of Hell in its treatment of the child protagonist.I entered the dream (or shall I say, the nightmare) as I read this book."
3,"Weird, quirky, scary","Beware the red snake! Told from the perspective of a young boy, The Red Snake (Hino Horror 1) is a story of the above boy, the house he inhabits, and the forest around his house that stretches on and on. The characters in the story are all mad: his grandfather, who sports a massive growth on his jaw; his grandmother, who believes she is a chicken; his father, who is vicious to the chickens he raises (except for his mother, to whom he provides eggs that so that she can claim she laid them herself); and his sister, whose affection for insects borders on the erotic. The story evolves into a classic nightmare."
5,You Can't Beat Reiner,My reviews of the recordings of Fritz Reiner are starting to become monotonous; excellent sound and wonderful interpretation! You simply cannot go wrong with this new edition to RCA's Living Stereo Hybrid SACD series. Reiner knew Strauss personally and just has a natural way with his music; fantastic recording and well worth your money!
1,Buyer beware,"I received one of these towel warmers for Christmas. The towels never got above room temperature, if that. The company suggested putting more than one towel on the warmer. I tried 4 towels and a robe, acting as a coat to cover the towels. After 2 days the towels were no warmer than before. Since we did not purchase the towel warmer directly from the manufacturer, they are not willing to take it back. Also be leary of the so called testimonials on the manufacturers website. I gave a very negative review for this product about 2 months ago. It does not appear on the website. So to end this saga the towel warmer is headed to the land fill. Sorry Al Gore that is how it has to be."
1,heated towel stand,It would have been great had it not been faulty.We believe the switch was broken. It wouldn'tmake any effort to heat up.
2,Disappointment,My son loves to watch the Baby Genius nursery songs on comcast on demand so I assumed that the cd would be great too! Nope. Big disappointment.
5,Excellent Magazine for kids and adults!,"Answers Magazine does a great job of presenting new scientific research as well as mainstream scientific theory and examining it for the facts instead of just pushing an agenda. While there are many articles challenging the presuppositions of those opposed to the Magazine's belief system, the editors also seem to be very careful not to twist science just to fit their school of thought. Beyond science, the Magazine examines biblical accuracy and offers logical explanations on how many historical events ""could have happened"" while still accepting that there are also many supernatural events which cannot be explained through science alone. Excellent work in each magazine. Readers will be challenged and encouraged. Oh, and the pictures are always great, too!"
4,Cute and cuddly,"This toy has been a part of the family for about a year now and is still in great shape - all the seams are strong and she remains soft and cuddly. Some matted fur on her back (over time, not original) and she gets treated quite well (not being pulled on or thrown about too much).The best thing about her? Soft and squishy - there are some stuffed animals that are a bit stiff and don't really do as an extra bed partner - this one however is soft and has an adorable face.Minus one star because while being soft and cuddly could have a LITTLE bit more stuffing as she isn't quite as puffy as she once was."
4,Good guidance,"This is an excellent,dependable resource for this area. The guide is easy to read, practical, informative and inclusive. I was pleased with the recommendations that I pursued."
5,Great Book,If you like Mitch Rapp style novels these are a great read! I don't like the publishers price for Kindle but that is my only complaint.
3,Not for me,"I know Thor is a good writer, but I just cannot get involved in his stories. Believe me, this is not my first attempt at his books."
4,Chilling Premise!,Thor's third book again stars super secret agent Scott Harvathwho is now employed by the Department of Homeland Security.Theevil empire Russia once again arises as our worse nightmare.Theirsleeper agents have hidden suitcase nuclear bombs all over the country.America discovers that the Russians can thwart a firststrike by the Americans. The President calls upon Scott Harvathto stop the threat to America.Harvath's friend Gary Lawlor hasalso dissapeared. It is up to Harvath to stop this conspiracy.A very good spy book that will keep your attention. A good book.Be sure to read it.
3,State of the Union,"I always enjoy Scott Harvath. It is wonderful airport and airplane reading. However, it seems in this book, Mr. Thor is obsessed with letting us know of his vast knowledge of firearms and military equipment. Good book, just needs more character building and less equipment building."
1,Dont Waste Your Time Or 5 Dollars.,I purchased this one for a quick vacation read. It looked likethe kind of book I like. This writer started out strong. Then each chapter got slower and slower and harder to read.I actually quit wasting my time and gave up on it A first for me in 48 years!This book should be required at Guatanamo for the terrorists.Eccept it would be cruel and unusual punishment!
2,Didn't finish it,"I took this on vacation and was looking forward to reading it. But I could only get about 1/2 way through. It was a little slow, with standard plot lines, nothing new here.If I didn't have a couple of other books, I would probably have finished it, so who knows, maybe the 2nd half is better."
2,Average to slightly below,"Brad Thor is not up to the paar of Vince Flynn and some of the other authors in this genre. Although the topic and theme of the novel is of the sort that intrigues, the execution is weak, and the story line falls short of the believable. His descriptions of locations and settings are well-done, but they should be only adding texture to a plot. Instead, they are the most easily read portions, and the plot and story line wanders. The dialogue is often cute, and seems to be auditioning for a screen play rather than that which is expected from the players such as these in real life."
3,Timely Topic,"Good book for a quiet evening. Action packed and interesting. I am finding that his story lines closely imulate Vince Flynn's in character and content. Otherwise, would have rated it higher."
3,Okay action thriller,"This is a fast moving action thriller. Although Mr Thor has not quite maintained the high standards of his first book, this is not bad. A previous reviewer is right that these novels are getting very close to those by Vince Flynn and his character Mitch Rapp and while entertaining, this did feel that it was treading a well worn path.Having said that, if you enjoyed the previous ones, you will probably enjoy this too. It suffers from a strong start, a weaker middle, and a good close much like the previous novels but it entertains well enough.If you like this kind of stuff and want a fresh take on it, I strongly recommend the British author, James Barrington."
5,Should Frighten Us All,"The two biggies when it comes to terrorist thrillers are bio-weapons and nuclear weapons. Either one of these when placed in the hands of a master story teller should produce plenty of scare. In ""State of the Union"" Brad Thor chose the latter of the two and he is indeed a master. This was an exponential scarefest. The subject of suitcase nukes combined with a bone-chillingly plausible yet unique storyline is simply master class fright!"
4,The American James Bond,"This 3rd novel in Brad Thor's Scot Horvath series is a winner. Thor manages to somehow make the numerous action sequences that permeate the book believable in spite of the fact his hero suffers many injuries that magically go away within five pages of the occurence! There is a nasty uber villain, attractive women (and ONLY attractive women) populate the pages, and there's enough globetrottting adventure, weaponry lessons, and assistant-heroes to please Ludlum, Clancy, and James Rollins' fans.Thor has created an American James Bond, one who we know is going to prevail no matter how difficult a situation might be. Read this with an open mind and you'll be amazed at how quickly the time passes by."
5,A New Contender for the Terrorist/Espionage Thriller Title,"Move over Clancy, watch out Vince Flynn. There's a new force in the game. Brad Thor is really turning out some great page turners. Though not yet as polished as Clancy in his prime, Thor's plots are as topical as todays headlines, the action never ending and the stories have more twists than a bushel of pretzels. I read my first Thor novel a year or so and thought it pretty good. I finished ""The Lions of Lucerne"" about a month ago and immediately ordered 4 more from Amazon. I read them in about a week!! I'm hooked. Go Scot Harvath! Thor's a former SEAL. Kind of nice to know that there's more to these patriotic warriors than incredible toughness. This one can write!!"
5,Suspense ala Brad Thor,"This is one in a series of eight books, and they were all fantastic. Once you start one you can hardly put it down.grace2u"
2,OK at best but I couldn't finish it.,"I tried to like this book, was really looking for another author along the lines of Vince Flynn or the old Tom Clancy but alas that was not to be if this book is any indication.I managed to get to chapter 14/15 or so before throwing in the towel and deciding I couldn't finish it, the story was just too dumb. Really, during a nuclear threat from Russia the President travels around with the Secretary of Defense to interview a low level agent from Homeland Security caught breaking into the home of a person of interest? The final straw was that we know Russia is lying about the nuke issue and the President seems like ""oh well I guess they are lying but what can you do?"". Bah... sorry to the fans but I just don't care for the story."
3,"Brad Thor ""State of the Union""","I bought these books for my husband, he liked tehm, but not as much as the Vince Flynn books."
3,Ok,"The ending was predictable but other wise the book was well written, suspenseful and addictive. I can't wait to see what Scot is up to next."
1,NOT Allergy Free,"The manufacturer claims that this pillow is ""allergy free,"" which I assume meant that people with allergies to feathers and down would not have an allergic reaction to this pillow.The claim is just not true. I tried using the pillow over several nights in a row, and almost immediately had an allergic reaction. If you want allergy free, go with something that doesn't have down or feathers."
4,An insider tells her shocking story of life near Andy Warhol,"When I began reading this I knew very little about Andy Warhol, and I am sure I have a lot to learn about this man, his art and it's impact on art history. Ultra Violet seems to paint an honest portrait of life at 'The Factory', with Warhol. I found it a very interesting read and I found it a worthy introduction into a world I knew little about; Andy's art scene in the 60's and 70's."
3,her 15 minutes are over a long time ago..........,"Even though I did read the disclaimer at the beginning of the book stating: all conversations are reconstructed and are not intended, nor shall they be construed, as verbatim quotes......I at times had a problem with Ultra Violets stories. Of course this is the type of book that we read inviting name dropping, at times though I do not know what to believe, such as the part that her and some friends were on the way to pick up Janis Joplin to attend a show and they found her dead in her room. This may be true however it seemed like the worst kind of name dropping ever......tacky, tacky, tacky. I think she was fortunate in meeting so many exciting people and I understand when you associate with great artists they at times give you paintings or sell paintings below dealer price..., but perhaps she should hold on to those memories and valuable pieces of art for a rainy day cause her 15 minutes seem to be over a long time ago."
3,Wished there were more details.,"Very quick read, not enough juicy stories. I am sure Ultra has many more torrid tales. If your a collector of Warhol & that era, it is a must have."
5,Fascinating return to the 18th century,"This rebirth of Britannica's first edition is fascinating. Being regarded by many as one of the most important reference books in the English language, it is a pleasure to hold the exact copy of the first edition in my hands. Would you like to see the world of the 18th century by the eye of the scholars of that age? And would you like to hold a book that very closely resebles original one - including aged paper, old font with simulated (?) imperfections...? If your answer is yes, this is the right one (or I should rather say 'the right three'). Kind regards, Mario."
5,a guitar master legend in the making,"Anyone who has enjoyed SRV or jimmy hendrix will be astounded by the licks this young man can play. At the end of listening to the cd you will be saying ""kenny wayne who?"" or "" johny lang who?"". don't get me wrong these guys are some of thbest young slinger out there, but Corby is by far well ahead of the pack and only has room to grow. If at all possible, see him live and you will be left shaking your head in disbelief."
1,Misleading description/missing information,"The product description says ""Hyaluronic acid 300 mg (90 capsules)"" But it turns out that the 300mg is ""Collagen Protein Complex"", only 15% of which (45mg) is hyaluronic acid. This information is not revealed either on (...)"
3,Pretty good game until the ending,"I always enjoy ""point and click"" type games, and have played a couple Nancy Drew. This game was really enjoyable, but I did have to resort to the walkthrough a couple times to help with the puzzle solving. I finally made it to the end, but couldn't finish it because of the snowmobile chase. I finally gave up after quite a long time of trying (and a sore wrist!), and never did see the ending. All in all though, a pretty good game."
4,DIFFERENT FROM THE REST,"The makers of this game went about it a little differently on this one, therefore making for a less predictable and more enjoyable game experience. There are still some repetitive tasks you must complete to finish the game, but the added elements made it feel not so bad. I'm gonna give this one a huge thumbs up. Definitely worth the play for fans of this genre. The ending was kinda weird, but kool still."
2,Pain. In. The. Neck.,"Beware of the evil Fox and Geese game in this one. They should not have made this so impossible to win, because you cannot move on in the game until you win it. It is a PAIN. It took me days until I finally got lucky and won. Overall, the game besides this one irritation is good. It's fun to play chef, the story line is interesting, and I do get a kick out of Nancy's random mumblings in the bathroom. But if you're aiming to buy this game and finish it in one sitting, pfft, good luck trying. That one mini game will not be defeated so easily."
5,really fun game,"the graphics are very good, the story line is better than the ""legend of the crystal skull"" which is the next one after this one and this game is fun to play. this is a good game, almost like the books."
3,Give this game a cold shoulder,If you enjoy doing the same thing over and over this could be the game for you. Very slow moving and actions are greatly restricted.
4,Dependable Her Interactive,I anxiously await the arrival of each new game. White Wolf was entertaining and somewhat challenging. Much better than Kapu Cave. I can always count on Her Interactive to keep me entertained.
2,Not So Hot!,"My 5-year-old daughter and I just finished Kapu Cave, which we both enjoyed playing together. My daughter was then looking forward to this newest release. But...Firstly, it wouldn't run video at all (only audio) on our older laptop which runs XP. Very annoying start to say the leaast! We borrowed my husband's...Then started playing - er, cooking...tediously...MANY times a day...completely interfering with our progress in the game. After a couple of days, we finally just stopped playing White Wolf, and my daughter hasn't asked about it since.We hope the next game doesn't involve tedious ""chores."" We have enough of those already. Give us some real clues!"
4,A good Nancy Drew game!,"I quite enjoyed this installment in the Nancy Drew series. This episode finds Nancy at a winter resort in Canada, trying to track down a dangerous prankster who has been damaging the resort's property and harming guests. There are several suspects, all staying at the resort, and Nancy poses as the new maid to try and figure out who is responsible.Generally this is a solid game- there's lots to do, and plenty of interesting scenery. The resort is not as inherently scary as some of the other places Nancy finds herself (like old mansions and dark graveyards), but there are lots of places to explore. My two main complaints were with mini-games. The first is a snowball fight you have to complete every time you want to go outside. The second is a board game called ""Fox and Geese"" which took forever to finish and lost its appeal long before that.Still, I'd recommend this game, to experienced Drew players and new ones."
4,Ducks and Geese and Foxes and Owls,"Some of the games included in the story take too long to figure out and I lost patience. I bought it for my children, and they were able to finish it but I was bored trying to get the FOXes and GEESE or whatever to do what they were supposed to do in order to move on. I dropped out in the middle and don't think I'll be back to finish. It would be good for anyone who likes the other Nancy Drew games, since it is pretty much like others."
2,Disappointment,"HER Interactive has done better in the past; and there is no excuse for this drab (endlessly monotonous), repetitive (boring, tedious), dreary (you get the idea) and frankly simple game. Unless you already have ALL the other ND games, and simple must have this one, choose something else."
2,White Wolf of Icicle Creek,"I usually love Nancy Drew. I have a lot of the games in the series. I thought that this game would be no different. I played the game with satisfaction until the end. When I got to the point in the game where I could not advance unless I WON the fox and geese game, that is where the game went south.I purchased this game in 6th grade. I am now in 9th grade and still have not finished this game because of that dumb fox and geese game. The only way I knew what happened was because I had to look it up on the internet.The fox and geese game is kind of like checkers, which I was NEVER good at. If you are like me and not good at checkers, or anything like it, I definitely would not recommend this game for you.I gave it 2 stars because I can not finish this game. I didn't give it 1 star because everything else about it was good. That's my take on the White Wolf of Icicle Creek."
5,Love nancy Drew games!!,This one is fun!I think I like this most of all!Love to make the wolf do tricks and to track the mad bomber!There is quite a bit of traveling too!
4,Most Nancy Drew games rock,This game however does not. I love Nancy Drew games but not this one the characters are very rude the ending is the longest one I have ever seen it pushes it limits with you all the way games 1-15&17-26 are mostly good this game however is the worst.
1,Careful! This game won't work on older computers. No returns.,"This is probably a very good game, but I wouldn't know it because . . .while all the other Nancy Drew games work fine on my computer, this one won't play. It turns out that I have the wrong kind of driver. One of my computers won't do anything; the other one has a totally scrambled picture. I can't return the game since it's opened (except for the exact same game, which won't help).You should check the tech support page of herinteractive.com (Post titled ""Driver Card"" ) and follow the instructions to see if it will work on your computer before you buy it. Considering that I just threw $18 down the toilet, I thought I would warn others who don't have the newest computer. For me, the game stinks.I hope you can get the game to work on your computer. It looks like fun."
5,Awesome as usual,"Loved the game, although I wish they wouldn't have taken out the part where Nancy writes her letter & the ending is different. But overall, Nancy rocks as usual!"
1,Cannot rate...doesn't work on my computer,"I have never had a problem with any of the other Nancy Drew Mystery games (I own them all) except for this one. I can load the game unto my computer, hear voices and sound effects, see some text at the bottom of the screen, but everything else remains black. No video. I am VERY disappointed."
3,My daughter likes it but it drove me crazy,This is the only ND we haven't completed. We didn't mind the cooking and the cleaning. It was the aimless mystery and the interminable Fox and Geese game that just killed this for me.
3,FRUSTRATION !!!!,THIS GAME WOULD BE FLIPPIN FANTASTIC IF IT WERE NOT FOR THE STUPID FOX AND GEESE GAME....ANNNNNNNNDDDDD THEMMMMMMM PUTTING THE NEW GAME BUTTON BY THE LOAD BUTTON....IT IS SOOOOOOO EASY AND QUICK TO JUST START THE WHOLE GAME OVER....NOT ONCE BUT TWICE FOR ME AND THE 2ND TIME I WAS VERY FAR INTO IT....GIVING UP FOR AWHILE ON THIS GAME...MAYBE I SHOULD OF BOUGHT THE $20 SHIP GAME INSTEAD.........GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
4,love ND games!!!,"I have all the ND games from #10-#19. I have the Vista OS. I have not encountered any problems loading any of these games except for The Legend of the Crystal Skull. Directions for loading that game I found on the HerInteractive site. I absolutely love playing these games. They are not easy. I have had to get a walk-thru at some point on every one of them. I plan on purchasing all of them. I do check to make sure that the game is Vista compatible. I think some of the older ones have been reissued so they run smoothly with Vista. Anyone who likes solving puzzles, some easier than others, will enjoy playing these games. My sister and I are hooked!!!!"
3,Not as Good...,"I have played all the nacy drew games and have enjoyed them all but this one i am having a really hard time getting into. some of the puzzles have been illogical and the cooking in this game is severly repetitive and disruptive. you have to cook all three meals everyday of the game and in a certain time frame. you have to stop whatever you are doing to do this boring task before the meal is over and you cant make the food. Anyways if you have played all the nancy drew games i would get this one also but if its your first time at nancy drew i would recommend danger by design, creature of kapu cave, curse of blackmoore manor, train to bluemoon canyon, shadow ranch and ghost dogs. :)"
2,disappointing,"We have purchased and played every Nancy Drew game as a family. Our kids currently range in age from 6-15. We have been playing these for 6 or 7 years. Although there are some interesting twists and turns, overall this game lacked the excitement of many of the prior games. The kitchen,the snowball fight, and the snowmobile chase were all boring and repetitive. We like the puzzles which require thinking and remembering, and there are precious few in this game. This game also had so few characters and such a limited setting that it lacked much depth. This was our least favorite of all the Nancy Drew games. We hope for improvement in future games."
1,Not worth the frustration,"I have played every Nancy Drew game and was completely irritated by this game. Some of the activities involved no thinking but took an extremely long time to finish while allowing for no quick way to complete. This game takes an extreme amount of patience to the point that it is not even fun anymore. Many of the clues were disjointed and difficult to obtain plausible conclusions. It is by far my least favorite, even liking the Kapu Cave and Danger and Design better even though they were not exactly my favorite either. I am shocked at the number of positive reviews of this game and I am hoping that none of the rest are set up with mind numbing tasks and repetitive errands like this one was."
1,More cooking?,"First of all, we hit a brick wall in the middle of this game. We finally gave up and downloaded a few cheat sheets. Even with the cheat sheets, the game would not let us go any farther.Aside from that, you have to cook breakfast, lunch and dinner for the guests at the lodge over and over and over again. Talk about monotony!We gave up on this game, and we don't miss it at all."
4,Best ND game yet,This is my favorite ND game in the series. I LOVED itPlot:Nancy gose undercover to Icicle Creek Lodge as a maid/cook as of request by Chantel the lodge owner. Strange events have been happining and a white wolf appears every time a accedint happens.Plot 4/5Suspects 5/5Graphics 5/5ending 3/5this may not be Her Interactives best but compaird to Danger By Design and Creature of Kapu Cave this is great
2,I normally love Nancy Drew games but...,"I really enjoy most of the Nancy Drew games but this one is one of my least favorites. The worst parts are the Fox and Geese game (which you have to win three times!), snowmobiling (can be difficult for some), and having to cook all these darn meals. The best part of the whole game is the beautiful wolf."
3,Boring chores.,"The length of this game was much better compared to some of the previous mysteries. It starts out good with things to do that are fun and you can explore the lodge. The bad thing, in my opinion is the game has time in it, if you talk to someone or if you walk around the time of the day goes by in the game. Nancy Drew works as a maid and a cook so she MUST be present in the kitchen for lunch and breakfast and dinner at the certain time of the day. every singe day that she gets up she has to do cook and clean the rooms. it gets frustrating to do that. And one of the characters in the game i just could not find, the Guadalupe lady, it took me ages to find her and when i did i was really annoyed by that time. Other than that I enjoyed interacting with the white wolf and getting to solve the mystery."
2,Kind of Disappointing,"I happened to recently read the hardcover edition of this book courtesy of the local library here in Las Vegas. Although it is 276 pages and written in 1976, it really only covers events through 1960. And those events are covered in a general nature, whereas things that I consider to be meaningless are covered in detail. Plus it kind of skips around chronologically. My guess is that since 1976, more information might appear in other books by Clark, or books related to American Bandstand; I would suggest those books be looked at first."
2,Terrible & Horrible Lame Acting,This Season Season 7 Was Pretty Weak With Horrible & Terrible Casting Members Some Good & Great & Some Just Really Bad & I Don't Think Acting Lessons Would Have Helped Them & Tara Price Was a Terrible & Horrible Medical Examier & I Prefered Alex Woods & Timothoy Speedle or Tim Speedle He Was a Great Actor & After He Left Hollywood He Struggled Too Find Work as a Actor & Had Too Go Too Something Different After Just 2 Seasons & Right on The Third Killed on The First Episode & CBS Has Really Lost There Marvels & Minds These Days The Demonic Forces Own There Souls & Hearts Mind & Body & Soul & Babylon The Great The Empire of False Regilion & Mid-Evil Spirits & Wicked People Who Perform Magic Spiritsem Harry Potter Twlight & Dark Magic & Darkest Magic Given By Works of Demon's Devil's & Witche's & Wizard's & Mid-Evil Human God's & Polatics & Relious Leaders.
4,Nice,"This is a great Tv show. I have season one thru six and thinking about buying this season seven. From season five, six and this season 7, it's all David Caruso on the dvd cover, can CBS give the other cast members on the cover box a chance? No offence, Mr. Caruso."
1,underwhelmed,"even as a beginner yoga student, i barely found use for most of this kit. i thought id get started with something inexpensive and better than my floor rug. i was wrong, a waste of money. the matt and bag and straps were all flimsy, made of lame material. the only use ive gotten from this kit is the blocks, which work perfectly. go with another kit"
5,Environmental Consciense,I think the Poncho is simply awesome as well anything you can buy here from amazon.com or some of it sellers but I want to focus in something else. How a 1.76oz Poncho can be packed in a big cardboard box with more cardboard paper inside it that almost completes 1 pound or more a guess; ok lets review from 1.76oz to 1 pound that is to much rapping and no environmental consciense at all...
2,Not bad but...,"Not a bad book to begin with, but not something that is going to interest people above 'apprentice' level. The extensive bibliography has some good suggetions. Decent. I recommend it as a starting place for only for serious students. The only people I wouldn't recommend it to are those who confuse witchcraft (not a religion) for Wicca (a religion) (we don't want to offend those who want to white wash 'magic' and the occult).I recommend anything by R. Cavendish as a better read."
3,Readers are better off researching this themselfs,"This book is definitely for naughty teenagers who wanna know about black magic. The information in this book seems to be from an outsider's point of veiw, which is to say i doubt the author has any practical experience in the practice of magic. The book passes on the same drawn out rumors and could be likened to John Symonds, whom he obviously used as research for the Great Beast exposition. Its entertaning at most, insightful, its not. Also i must add that every single magician in history wasnt guilty of black magic."
5,Very detailed!,"234 pages full of history, dealing with necromancy, sorcery, astrology, alchemy and prophecy. The book also deals with great occult pioneers like the chain-smoking Helena Blavatsky, the far-seeing Nostradamus and the famous Comte De St-Germain. It explains the origins of magic, black and white, diving deep into its myths, background and evolution."
4,Interesting Reading,"For all of those who are novices or beginners in the quest for forbidden subjects, such as necromancy and spell casting, this book provides a great introduction. It's filled with different subjects and settings, so there never really is a point at which is becomes boring or repetitive. A must for all those interested in demonology!"
5,Great,Nobody can sing along to Keep Your Head to the Sky. One of the great songs of all time. (Reasons is also way up there.)
4,it's good,the last reviewer hit the point for me.this disc has so many different styles and textures.another good record from my fav band.
5,kiss the future is the future now!!!dub!!!!,"this completely blew me away. i;ve never been a on u sound or mark stewart completist . for me this hits the best dub moments of stewart's career. i've read reviews that say this isn't complete enough. how could it be, stewart's been around awhile. still, the dubbed out tracks on here make you realize the dub genius of adrian sherwood and mark stewart. the pop group really updated dub in the era of the late 70's. stewart continued and continues to break ground in the area of distorted-in your face- dub productions. from track 1 - 12 i had a huge smile on my face!"
4,interesting,"While maybe not perfect, this gives you a pretty good idea of what mark stewart has been making over some decades. It starts with stuff from his Pop Group period and moves well into the Mark Stewart and Maffia stuff that I prefer."
4,Interesting view worth going through the lines for.,"Although the writing style and the frequent repetition in the text sometimes distracted from getting the point that was being made, the advice and lessons within the book are well worth digging for. I found the last few chapters had the most to offer with the last couple lines of the book really summing it up."
4,A must read,"This book wonderfully led you into the mind of a horse. It was very well written. The only reason that I rated it 4 stars intsead of five was because I did not fully agree with everything said. That is ok, it was only my opinion. This book shows you how to reconsider everything you do on a horses back, near a horse or around a horse. It does no tell you how to do something or what it might feel like, but it tells you how to get there. I loved it. Any person that is even a little interested in Horses and would like to know more, I urge you to read this book."
5,A must have book for any rider,"This is an excellent book, full of great information. Fantastic insight into the horse and his brain. Though the writing itself is a bit cumbersome in some respects, overall the philosophy and information makes sense and is interesting. I am recommending this book to all my dressage friends, but I think this is a must have book for anyone that rides."
2,Not written by Franz Mairinger !,"Unfortunately this book seems to be more of a gratitude to Mr Mairinger by the author than a dressage tutorial as one might have expected. There are too many analogies used (50 pages out of 170) to emphasize the basic and most important fact of horsemanship; ""feeling of your horse"" Focus on different effects and transitions is not covered thoroughly and well enough."
5,All parts included,"All parts needed to mount a steering wheel, even for the do-it-yourself people out there.Needed it for a '67 Mustang, no complaints."
1,Definitely a 20th century piece.,"The title of the piece, Dracula: The Musical Opera, is misleading. It is in no way a musical, but is in every way a 20th century opera.Unfortunately, I am not partial to 20th century opera. Being a singer, I love to sing songs from shows around the house. But it seemed, to my ears, that this entire piece was a string of recitatives full of random notes and contrived lyrics. There were no actual songs on the CD. I do understand that I am not atune (no pun indended) to 20th century music's subtle neuances and deeper musical structure. I appreciate ""classical"" opera and modern musicals, both of which have stirring and memorable melodies and lyrics, something that this composition lacks.If you are looking for something akin to a musical please avoid this CD. But, I can offer no suggestion one way or the other for lovers of 20th century operetic sounds."
4,As good as it gets...with caveats,"This chair is amazing. So sturdy you can stand up on it, nice side table, very comfortable. The only flaw I have found (I have one that is nearly 8 years old) is that the caps used on the legs where they sit on the ground wear off - which allows each leg to take a core sample of the earth it is sitting on."
4,Excellent product,Easy to install and to wire. I added a timer to make it workonly during few hours because it is not necessary to run it24 hours a day.Good ratio quality for price
3,"Good towel rack, questionable heater","I have had this for two years. It works, but you have to make sure you wrap the towel around it in such a manner that lots of towel surface touches the metal directly. It is not hot enough to provide radiant heat to the towel.So, if you are going to use one of these, know that your towel needs to have an hour before it is warm enough to care."
3,Caveat Emptor,"Although this item claims to be compatible with the video iPod, it is so, but only if you're good with an exacto knife. The cutout for the headphones is centered instead of offset to the right.Also it's not really clear what options you're getting with this product. When I bought one for my iPod video at Target, the cutout was in the right place, and the iSnug came with a separate internal cover for the iPod as well as a full size scratch guard for the front.When I bought this one for my kids, well.... you already know about the cutout, but the internal cover and the screen guard were not included. Fortunately, I am good with an exacto knife."
2,Be Carefull,"This product is not cut right for IPod Generation 5 or the new 160 GB IPOD Classic. I'm going to use an exacto knife but it's a hassle. This product only comes with the two cases... there are no internal protectors... do not go by the pictures. Two cases only... I'm going to keep them, but I probably should have returned the product."
4,Isnug keeps ipod secure,I really like the way the Ipod ends up anchored inside the isnug protection case. I highly recommend this product.
2,warmrails for towels,"Well, the other reviews said the towels don't get very warm and they were right. It is kind of a disappointment"
3,Haven't tried the product yet,but be careful. I bought this as a Christmas gift for my husband. Imagine HIS surprise when the package arrived with the writting all over the box saying what it was. This does not come shipped in the typical brown box like most Amazon stuff.
4,Nice for drying things out,"These definitely are a high-quality item, and they do actually dry towels and swim suits out nicely, but if you are looking for something that provides a roastingly hot towel for when you get out of the shower, this is not it. It is not the same as getting a hot towel just out of the clothes dryer. But the product itself is worth the money for quality."
1,bad experience,"had to return this twice, worst amazon experience ever, kept coming back with damage or dirty, rust on outside, bad experience"
4,Towel Warmer,"Good product, easy to install. You need to have the proper expectations of what a towel warmer can do. The towel is really only warm where it makes contact with the warmer. Cloth does not conduct heat very well. That being said, I am pleased with the result."
4,Nice but,We have been using this for a few years now. It's nice for drying towles but does not do much as far as warming them before a shower. Aloso good for drying sweaters and other things that can not go in the dryer.
2,Won't Help if you Have a Toothache,"Sorry, but seeing everything, and I mean EVERYTHING, as God's purposeful will and surrendering to it just doesn't do it for me. When, the good Brother doesn't explain, do you revolt and try to change things and make them better? I'd pass on this one."
4,Great if you like shredded jerky,This is even better than the typical circular shredded beef jerky you get from convenience stores and the like. I had no problems with shelf life and particularly enjoyed this product.
1,won't hold charge,"After about a little less than a year of use, the saw will not hold a charge any longer. It was never very powerful to begin with but total malfunction after less than a year is not what one expects from B & D. Go back to the workshop B & D and work on your batteries!"
5,Black & Decker,it is small but it is very powerful and worker it can cut wood and iron. it is very conveniont
3,Not Variable Speed.,"I kept wondering why this was harder to get going and stay in the groove than my plug-in Black & Decker jigsaw for a similar price. Apparently, the price I paid for a similarly dollar priced cordless saw vs. plug-in saw is this only has an on/off switch (not variable power). As soon as the power switch makes contact it blazes at full speed making it harder to get cuts started and even to stay in the groove on some materials after they're started. Make life a little easier and spring for one with variable saw speed if you don't mind paying a little more, I would have but I wasn't paying attention so I'll get some use out of this one before replacing it."
3,B&D CHS6000 Handisaw,Good for light duty work in and around the house. Only cordless saw I found on the market in this price range.
1,You can't buy Replacement Battery,I was happy with the operation of this unit but when the battery died I discovered you can't buy the battery from Black and Decker. You have to return it to a service center for repair. The cost was prohibitve as it was more than a new unit. In other words it's a throw away unit. Very disappointed.
3,Very Weak Power,"This handisaw is useful but it is very weak. It works best if you still do the usual back and forth sawing motion with the power. I was hoping it would just require guiding the saw along in a straight line. I guess you get what you pay for. This is worth having for the low price, I paid about $25 plus shipping, I wouldn't pay anymore then that though."
1,Black & Decker Cordless Handisaw,I purchased this item as an exact replacement for one I already had.The blades that are supposed to fit this item do not fit in the slot.I had to take the whole thing apart and I used the blade holder from my broken oneto make it work. I should have sent it back but needed it right away.
2,Why would anyone buy this?,"I feel bad for the person at B&D that had to sign off on this product. This saw only cuts SOFT wood, the kind that is just as easy to slice through the a dull hand saw. I cannot ever cut thin dry bamboo with it! B&D should have to pay a carbon tax for the materials used to produce this worthless plastic garbage."
4,Not a Weak Sister,"I was presented with this saw as a gift, I was pretty doubtfull of it when I first held and examined it. I just didn't think something so small and light could be powerful enough to be useful.I was wrong I have used it many times for cutting several types of material.I highly recommend it."
1,good but then crap crap crap,"I hate writting bad reviews but this one is worth itSo i had the saw for about a month now and today as I was trying out these new blades I bought, I put one in and as I was starting to saw it worked perfectly fine for about 4 seconds, then the blade fell out, as i was trying to put it back in, the clamp would just let it loosely fall back out again.I think a washer ring got loose and didnt accept it anymore.well i am sending it back for a replacement and i hope the next saw does not do the same thing!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"Under powered, unimpressive.","In a word, awful. Slow, underpowered - it will try your patience. I'd say it's back to the drawing board on this one. Got tired of putting it down and grabbing the corded jigsaw to finish the job. Best advice? Avoid my error and move on to something that meets the qualification of actually being "" useful""."
3,Black & Decker CHS6000 Handisaw Cordless Powered Hand Saw,"Good concept, but not enough power for any but the softest woods. I actually found it handier, with the right blade, for moderate pruning in the yard rather than for the dimensional lumber used in home repairs."
2,Not as easy as it looks,"I bought the saw to cut trim and small boards, but it was difficult to use. In order to keep enough pressure on the saw so it didnt want to bounce around the smaller 1/2 inch boards would break. It didn't want to cut 1 inch boards at all. On the good side it allows you to cut hard to cut shapes and changing the blade is simple.Over all I would not buy this Item again unless it was under $20."
4,great tool for small do it youself projects,"We do not own a circular saw. I have always felt like we do not need one. This hand saw was great to use. We used it to orgainaze my outside storage room, cutting peg boards and 1/8 inch plywood to make shelving. It will not cut any thing over 1 inch thick. The cut is a clean cut if you hold it correctly and close to what you are cutting. It charges very quickly and cuts a long time. I believe that,""having the RIGHT tool makes the job a whole lot easier and faster."" The storage room looks GREAT."
2,did not last,"Worked well but after a few uses,it went dead. Recharging,nothing helped!I liked it very much but the failure was very disapointing. I used it for small jobs instead of my big sawalls."
3,Handisaw,"As an older widow lady I purchased this saw to prune some small trees/brush behind my newly purchased mobile home. Also, I wanted to cut down some thin trees at wood's edge. I have to say that, though it seems many have used this saw for pruning, I was not able to get enough of a grip on the saw to even prune. I don't know that I will have any other opportunities to use the saw, but as a handicrafter, it will be here if and when I need it.Mainly, I read the reviews and thought it would get my pruning and small-cutting done, but it just didn't cut it for me!My son will get the job done, but isn't it nice when you don't have to depend on the kids!If you have multiple possible uses for this saw, it is overall a good saw."
2,Housewife's reciprocating saw,"If you need a light tool, for SMALL jobs, and don't want, or are initmidated by, a full-size reciprocating saw, then this is perfect for you. It's marketed as a jigsaw, but is completely useless as one. The blade guard makes it impossible to see where your cutting line is, even when I installed the blade upside down it was hard to see because of the sawdust accumulation. Also, the battery drains too quickly, 1/4"" mdf kicked this saw's butt in less than 20 mins. Having to hold the safety makes the grip awkward for long cuts, and because of how light the tool is the battery's location makes it unbalanced. Good for cutting small pipes, pruning small branches, and other quick and dirty cuts, bad for any serious work"
3,Better Hand Saws Out There.,Works OK for small cuts. Lacks power when used on hard woods. Wear safty glasses. Broke a few blades. Blade change really quick and EZ. Cutting material needs to be on solid surface. Hard to see cutting line. All depends upon your needs.
1,Perhaps I go a lemon -- or perhaps these are just wimpy!,"I am happy with other Black & Decker cordless tools I have purchased through Amazon.com (and I love Amazon.com), so I ordered this cordless saw. Unfortunately, this saw would run for only a very short period of time (10 minutes?) -- and took hours to re-charge. I ended up sending it back and buying (again, from my favorite online store - Amazon.com) a saw with a cord -- the Bosch Model 1640VS ""Finecut"" saw. It was much more expensive, and for some folks it might not be as useful as a cordless reciprocating saw, and the blades are not cheap -- but I am hopeful the Bosch will take care of my needs."
3,"Nice saw, but battery dies too fast","I bought this thinking it might be a good all around the house kinda saw for the odd jobs. The saw itselfs works well for being a little slower and shorter than other powered saws I've used. The biggest bummer was the short battery life. After a full charge, I'm usually only getting 15-20 minutes of action; it might be something I'm doing, but I doubt it. I'm leaving it on the charger when not in use as recommended. But if you only have a small project with minimal cutting, this is great."
2,"Stupid design, but a good pen","the cap that closes the pen part of the stylus is held on by a samll divot thing, it usually comes off of the pen before the stylus comes out of the holster, it also extends less than the stylus that came with the hermes(Tytn, 8525) so it is harder to hold, also i think the stylus divot that holds the whole thing in the holster is slightly bigger, so it almost ruined the stylus hole in my tytn and made it so it could not hold any stylus, it is however a good pen, and very convenient which is why i gave it a 2"
3,Fairly OK,"This replacement seems shorter and smaller than the original meaning it can easilly fall out of the slot in the long run. It's tough to access the pen bec the cap is tight and has tendency to loosen by constantly accessing the Pen. Overall, it's fairly OK if you want a pen."
5,Stuart Trusty recommend this CD to Susan Ye,"(Stuart to Susan) From the same luminary that left ""Goldberg Variation"" on our front doorstep, lit it on fire, rang the doorbell, then ran away comes a rendition of the scatological DavidsbundlerTanzes. As we know, Schumann wrote this while beating his head against the wall in an insane asylum shortly before drowning himself in a lukewarm puddle of congealed grease. Perahia does an excellent job with the psychotic stylings of Schumann while adding his own unique nuances reminiscent of the strangulation of small animals or the decapitation of a hyena. anyone with too much money to burn that could use a shiny round coaster is encouraged to purchase this and other Perahia recordings.(Susan's reply) Thank you, stuart, for your recommendation except that classic lovers usually don't have too much money to burn on anything else but music."
1,great idea but not so great in practice,"i had these and i tried it b/c my son wouldn't take the bottle after i breastfed for a month... not only he didn't like it, it also leaks like crazy. it flowed too slow for him. maybe this would work for newborns but not when they're a bit older. there's only one hole and he got frustrated sucking so hard. and did i mention it leaks and wasted my milk. the plastic feels cheap too. i went back to avent and he did fine switching back and forth."
1,Not for my son,"My son won't have anything to do with these bottles! I'm breastfeeding and I was so excited about trying them after reading the reviews, but unfortunately they were a complete waste of money. My son took to Avent bottles immediately. Good luck for those who try these bottles!"
1,Creates gas rather than reducing it.,"I'm so disappointed in this product. All of it ended up in the recycle bin after less than a week.The nipple collapses in upon itself pretty severely, creating gaps between my son's mouth and the nipple, through which he gulps down air. There's no air intake in the nipple so eventually the vacuum is so strong no more milk comes out. The only way to break the vacuum again is to pull the nipple out of his mouth and let it fill out. We have to do this about once a minute while feeding him, so maybe 20 times per feeding! Outrageous.We got these to try and reduce his gassiness, but instead he swallows so much air while feeding, he winds up with lots of gas and can't sleep."
3,"Good bottle, leaks like crazy","Reading the glowing reviews, I wonder how long people have been using these. First let me say this is the only bottle we've ever tried, and our baby drinks all the time-- no problems. At first, the bottles work great, but after some time, they begin to fall apart. This is particularly evident if you are boiling the bottles, or dishwashing on high heat (our baby had thrush, so we had to do this). The double nipple system begins to fall apart, dissolve, large holes start appearing in the inner (blue) nipple. The two nipples and plastic bottle also begin to deform. All this leads to incessant leaking. The bottles seem to last about a month in heavy use. Designed obsolescence? Sure seems like it."
4,great for breastfeeding but...,"I have been breastfeeding my daughter now for 5 weeks and everytime i go to work twice a week my baby was feeding from medela and born free bottles but when i would get home , my daughter would latch all wrong and it would take me two days to fix her latch! These nipples are perfect but the bottle does contain BPA! I was hesitant to buy thesr for three whole weeks then my nipple cracked one night and OMG!!! So as a chemist i know that BPA is only expelled through heat so I DO NOT ever store, heat or sterilize these bottles..instead wash with ice cold bottled water and store your milk in medela or bornfree bottles and even heat the milk in these then transfer or use bottle liners!hopefully they make a bpa free bottle soon and then i'll give them five stars...be careful but if you breastfeed and pump..these bottle are PERFECT..the nipples are just PERFECT! I am grateful and so are my breasts =D"
4,Mistake on Amazon,"My only complaint is a mistake on the Amazon description. It says it comes with 3-5 ounce bottles. It doesn't, it only comes with 2. There are 4 bottles total in this set."
3,"Nice bottles, but my son didn't like them.","I only rate this product with 3 stars, because my son tried them but didn't like them. The bottles are very nice. The kit is great. A friend told me about these bottles and used them when weening her son from the breast to the bottle. I was having a rough time with my son, going from breast to bottle, so I tried these. He would not take them. He loves the evenflo classic bottle and nipple. The nipples are very small and that's what he likes. Hey, you never know till you try! For those babies who love the Breastflow kit, I'm sure it's the best kit. My son and I had to use something eles that worked for us. Good luck!"
1,not so great...,"I was very very excited about these bottles... however I soon grew to hate them and regret not buying more Avent. They leak like crazy... Its very annoying to have your baby crying and as soon as you give him the bottle, have the milk leak and have to take the bottle away and make her cry again while you put the milk in another bottle. I searched online and this happens to a lot of people, so its not just a bad batch that I got. I tried everything to make them work but nothing helped... and then, as soon as my daughter started having cereal in her milk, they became even more useless. Since the cereal makes the milk very thick, she has to suction very hard to get the milk out through both of the nipples. A bottle feeding of 5 minutes could easily take 45 minutes... and she eventually would get tired and give up and leave half of the milk in the bottle....not recommended."
2,Poor design,"I bought these bottles because I liked the idea of the baby having to work a little harder to get milk out of the bottle & thought it would prevent the baby from becoming a lazy nurser at the breast. I have chronic low milk supply & have had to supplement all three of my babies. This bottle seemed like the perfect answer forngoing between breast & bottle. While it is similar to how baby has to suck at the breast, the bottle design does not work. The nipple collapses on itself so badly, you have to remove the nipple from baby's mouth frequently. Also, this bottle causes my child to ingest so much air that she becomes very fussy & extremely gassy!! It is not worth the discomfort to the baby! I would not recommend this bottle at all!"
1,sadly disappointed,"I had originally registered for Dr. Brown's bottles as I had heard rave reviews from a number of friends and family. After having a pre-baby lactation consult, she convinced us that the breastflow bottles were a necessity for our expected twins. We brought the bottles to the hospital with us in case we needed to supplement- which we did. From the very start these bottles leaked, collapsed, and caused our twins to gulp air which resulted in terrible upset stomach and gas. Almost immediately their fussiness, upset stomach, and gas symptoms disappeared once we switched to Dr. Brown's. I would not recommend these bottles."
1,good idea - bad bottle,"I have noticed the same issue with the nipple collapsing. This is because air is not able to go back into the bottle while they are sucking. So, you have to pull the bottle away from them to let air in. My baby gets much gassier with this bottle because they end up swallowing a lot more air. I think the idea is great but execution is poor. Plus, at least a half ounce of milk gets trapped between the nipple pieces and I lose all that breastmilk because it does not empty. I have tried the Dr. Brown's bottles and the Born Free bottles and they are superior in quality and use to this bottle. Would not recommend this bottle."
3,My son on a fan.,I tried these for expressed milk but my son was not a fan. We did better with a basic bottel from Nuk.
5,Excellent novelisation of the Deep Space Nine Episode!!,"From the forward and history of the episode to the waythe episode was novelized, I thought it was one of theabsolute best of the ones done by the Star Trek franchise.The blending of original Star Trek episode with the newDeep Space Nine plotline interwoven was incredibly welldone."
3,"Nice Product, but Greatly Overpriced","This product is sturdy and as attractive as you can expect a towel rack to be. The warming/drying feature is OK, but not a huge benefit in actual usage. Perhaps if you live in a perennially damp or cold environment, you may feel justified in using the heating element. The real disappointment I experienced was value of the product compared to its price. I definitely experienced ""buyer's regret"", and if returning it didn't involve reboxing, shipping, etc., I would."
4,Very useful item,"This is a very useful item to own. It is easy to assemble. It does a good job of drying towels. My husband and I hang our bath towels on it at night and then shut off the unit in the morning. We get a lot more use out of our towels this way. The unit does get a little hot, so I would not recommend its use around young children. It does need a bit of floor space, so if your bathroom is tight, you might want to keep the unit in your bedroom or hallway."
3,Good except...,The only problem with the towel warmer is that it takes 25 minutes to warm up. It needs a built-in timer to turn it on and off.
2,Towel warmer is not warm enough,This towel warmer is not making your towel really warm. The item itself is warm but the towel was not warm after a few hours being on the warmer. ...May be I used the wrong towel....but it was my regular one that I use for a shower.
2,Questionable Quality,"I purchased 5 of these for Christmas gifts. One did not work at all and others were chipping. I question whether these producsts are 1st quality. For the price I spent, I was embarrassed and disappointed."
4,future,It is a great work of clean design and ease of use. My concern is; the lack of choice of mags and books to download that are of interest to me. Will this device be able to have color at some future point or do I have to buy a new one? I'm thinking of children and their books and part of what makes them exciting is the colorful art.
2,Not Great,We were very disappointed with the quality of this product. I wanted something that would warm and dry towels before/after showers. This seemed to neither. Quality was also very poor.
2,Not so Great!,I expected a super warm towel. It barely warms it. Just on the spot where its hung. Maybe I need to weave the towel through all the bars. But I dont know. I would try another one. This one kinda sucks.
2,Towel Warmer Not Too Good,The warmer only warmed the towel where it touched the towel no matter how we wrapped it around the bars.
4,sturdy and does the job,"We had a cheaper version of this brand that was OK, but was not very steady on its feet. This is much better, and the plug attachment is less prone to break. That said, it doesn't seem to heat the towels any better, which is somewhat of a disappointment. It may even be a little worse at that task. Still, it's very nice to have dry towels, particularly in the summer when the humidity is high."
4,Works well.,Only a 4 star rating. It is smaller than appears and tends to heat more where the rails are instesd of evenly. Still for the price hard to find one better.
1,warmrails------ DERAILED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This is a piece of junk......... Lasted a couple of weeks. Everyone of them broke in the same place. Poor foot support of plastic did not hold up to the weight of the towel. Poorly constructed and OVER PRICED.
4,For the price I took a gamble,"Well first thing I noticed was this wasn't packaged very well. No padding whatsoever, but it arrived unscathed. Next thing was the two screw holes didn't line up. This only has 2 screws and I couldn't get it put together. Frustrated, I was ready to return it, but tried one last time with my wife helping me pull the rails to align the holes.After using it for a couple days I find it works rather well. I'm used to having a regular dry towel so any warmth is a plus. My daughter who had her towels tumble dried says it's not warm enough. (she's spoiled) It doesn't heat the entire towel so we end up layering several towels and it retains the heat pretty well.Is this product worth the retail price of $200? I don't think so, but for the sale price, I think it's a nice addition."
2,Not that great....,I have to say I'm disappointed with this product. The towels never get very warm. I left a towel on the rack for 30 minutes and the best it could do was get it to a little above room temperature.
1,Should be a zero star option!,"This rail is a joke! The description and pictures are very,very misleading. The ""Satin Nickel"" is in fact a metallic greeny/gold paint, not the plating I was expecting. The overall quality looks very poor and the item had obviously been opened and assembled before."
5,JUST WHATIi WAS LOOKING FOR !,very nice - solid and heavy - looks great -no dissapointment -good value - best that I found in this category
2,Came in the wrong finish but box was correct and It doesn't warm the towels very well,Came in the wrong finish but box was correct but the big disappointment was that It doesn't warm the towels very well!
1,Parts missing,"Was excited to get it, however parts missing. Amazon put me to the seller and money was refunded. Very easy will continue to shop with Amazon. Thank you."
2,didn't really warm the towels,"I was really excited to get this product. I've always wanted a towel-warmer and it is really cold where I live. However, it really only creates stripes of warmth on the towels. It wasn't worth the price for me."
2,Broken in-transit,"The product works as advertised. However, one of the plastic 'feet' on the bottom which help stabilize the rack was broken when I opened the packaging. Other people have reviewed this product and mentioned the issue with lack of padding for the box.Mr. Manufacturer, I cannot recommend your product to my friends and family due to the apparently persistent negligence when it comes to customer satisfaction. I hope you read these reviews and fix the issue."
4,Works well.,"I have had this for about 6 months and haven't had any problems. It's easy to assemble, too. I put it on a timer as suggested by other reviewers."
1,DON'T BUY THIS BOOK,"This book has bunch of errors and incomplete informations. There are medical schools that exist for more than 30 years but the author didn't put it in, like the one in Florida, there are 4 schools but he only noted 3. He didn't do thorough research. The guy just wants $ from college students. Don't ever buy this book. This book needs lots of updates."
1,Little insight w/ an axe to grind,"Michael Leahy wrote a terrible book. Most of the box is a two season long nightly box score of a Wizards game in which MJ floundered in the 4th quarter sandwiched n between flowery prose of 'heroes' and 'titans' and other overused sports metaphors. Then there are the countless personal insertions of how the author was just as important to the story as Michael Jordan himself (how he was on the road on Thanksgiving or his presence in the locker room). The book could have been edited in half and been just as useful. I found little insight and to me the reader it looks like the author wasted two years of his life following MJ as the book didn't dent MJ's facade, which was clearly the author's intention. Michael Leahy will hate me saying this, but Michael Wilbon could have written this much better. I could care less how in bed Wilbon is with Jordan, but Leahy couldn't get Jordan to talk at all. Leahy failed. Terrible book."
2,don't read if you love Jordan.,"This book will really kill your love for MJ, so if you idolize him, stay away! The author paints a picture of MJ as a bad teammate who tears down anyone who does not conform to his image of how a basketball team should be run. The author also made Jordan out to be a diva who could not adapt to a running playing style, forcing his teammates and coach to operate a slow offense suited to his needs rather than those of his team.The author followed MJ (stalked him) for about two years to write this book, and Jordan did not cooperate with him. It is possible that the lens through which he views Jordan is biased. Whether this book is factual or not, don't read it if you are fond of MJ. If you like books that expose the flaws in athletes, then you will love this book."
2,He's still the best there ever was....,"Michael Leahy obviously likes to tear down icons. In doing so he comes over as petulant and singularly lacking in the understanding of what it takes for a Michael Jordan to be as successful as he was.All of the NBA elite are tough in an over the top alpha male hyper competitive environment. If they are not, they quickly fall by the way side. Obviously the author failed to grasp this fact.That Jordan wasn't a crack executive is neither here nor there. His single minded successful quest to be the best player ever, did not leave him much room to observe and learn board room politics.If Mr. Leahy ecomes half the writer that MJ was as a player he would have world's of success and probably win a Pulitzer, however, he will more likely have a career mirroring a Brad Sellers, just not good in the clutch!"
5,The Cornerstone of Modern Occultism,The Golden Dawn is the most influential and comprehensive study of occult practice that exists. The teachings contained in its pages are sufficient to train the newest Neophyte to the level of advanced adept. The information in its pages has been copied and reproduced so many times that it has become the seminal work of magick in the last 100 years.The Golden Dawn is perhaps the only truly complete manual of initiation and magick that is available today and it is essential to all students of the Balck Arts! A must have!!!
1,DO NOT BUY THIS EDITION!,"Maybe I am lucky... i have the original, limited edition New Falcon version.. even autographed by Chris Hyatt. I have owned the Llewellyn edition in the past, but disposed of it BECAUSE IT IS GARBAGE... incomplete, garbled... don't even bother with this edition. I believe ""The Complete Golden Dawn System of Magic"" (New Falcon publications) is also still being sold on amazon.com. It is more expensive... but you truly get what you pay for. Don't waste your time on this Llewellyn garbage. I think ZERO stars would be more accurate..."
4,A good beginning,"This book is a good beginning and intro into the Golden Dawn. It has serious errors within the contents, but is a must own for anyone studying the Golden Dawn system. Students of the HOMSI/GD should purchase the book and use in conjunction with grade materials and personal teachings."
2,800+ pages of Regardie?!?!?!,"Anyone who has attempted to read a book from good 'ole Israel has surely noticed, it's not an easy read; so 800+ pages is enough to give the most sophisticated a tumor. This book is not at all practical to any student, unless s/he wants to start his or her own Golden Dawn temple. So, if you want a book on magick, I recommend something practical like: Bardon, Kraig, Greer, or many others."
3,somewhat disappointing,"When I purchased this book, I was under the impression that it would contain a course to guide me through the Golden Dawn system. I was wrong. This is merely a collection of writings/notes by Regardie, and is not meant to be used alone.If you are looking for a course through the Golden Dawn system, I would recommend the book _Self Initiation Into The Golden Dawn Tradition_ by Chic and Sandra Cicero. I'm not sure how easy it is to find this book still, but it is possible to purchase from the publisher's website."
2,Out Right Confusing!!!,"This book may be a great reference book to the occult but thats all it is. It cannot be possibly read straight through from cover to cover. It is too long, borning at times, unorganize, mumbo jumbo i have ever read. What kind of book is this, its more of a big puzzle. You have to have a huge foundation of the order to even comprehend the first lecture. It is way to breif and mixed about. Not to be read out of sheer interests. YOu need to have studied for awhile, and frankly i just dont care to learn-nor do i have the patients for ""high"" magick."
2,I still don't see how David Blaine does it ...,"I bought this book recently, having had my interest piqued by dipping into the Harry Potter series that my youngest son Derek so admires. I can certainly understand the appeal of playing Quidditch (though the rules remain as impenetrable to me as American Football - sorry US friends!) and of flying and so on. However, Israel Regardie et al seem to be so into the arcane ""Ceremonial Magick"" esoterica that they miss the things that the common man like me would welcome - to wit, most of the tricks in the film ""Matilda"" and showing off at dinner parties. Being honest, this didn't even help me improve my sleight of hand. A real disappointment."
3,Good but complicated,"I picked up the golden dawn knowing somewhat of what cermonial magick is but, no real previous knoweldge of it or the hermetic order etc, looking back i wish i had read some of the other books mentioned before i started on this one. (which i plan to do when i finish with this). I myself do have pervious knowledge in magick so it is not like i am starting out of no where but, most of the material in this just flew right passed my head and made it spin 9000 miles an hour. This book does appear to be loaded with good information and i'd hope so for paying 30 bucks or so for a 700 page book but, If you are just starting out this book will just make ur head spin round and round"
3,Good but has several obfuscations.,"This is a great book for anyone who is interested in learning about the Golden Dawn system. The main problem with this edition is that the sections are too cluttered and several obfuscations have been added to confuse those who are not worthy of the hidden knowledge according to the Secret Chiefs. When reading this book, one must take into consideration that the author/compiler of the book was initiated into an offshot of the Golden Dawn ran by frondeurs of the original order orignially started by Westcott and Mathers. This comment goes the same for books written by the Zalewskis and the Ciceros.Howbeit, this is still good reading and a good reference manual and is a must have for anybody interested in the Western Mystery Tradition."
5,Treo Carrying Case,The Krusell carrying case and belt clip are the best design I've seen in a while. I've used many different cases and clips and I find this to be the best.
4,I really mean 1 star!,"I accidently placed 4 stars and I'm not able to change that rating for some reason. I apologize for the confusion.I ordered this expecting it to have some sort of adhesive with it so that I can stick it to my phone. It had NONE! Not sure how they expect me to attach my phone to this. If I had physically seen this before I placed the order, I would not have purchased it. But, it did get shipped quickly."
1,Broke too soon,"I have a Palm Tungsten e2 for which I purchased a Krusell case with the slide swivel. I love the case and I liked the fact that I could carry my Palm all the time when I'm working in the hospital. However, within a year of purchasing the case, the swivel broke. I did not realize that my Palm had fallen off my belt until at least 3 hours later. If it were not for a Good Samaritan that found the PDA and returned it, I would have been out $200 for a new one. By the way, Krusell does not warrantee the swivels. Maybe that should say something."
1,Does not hold cell phone,"I bought this clip because I lost my old one. The clip goes on the phone ok, but the slightest movement, and the phone will fall off. This has happened to me several times, so I've just decided not to use it anymore. Thankfully, my cell phone was in a good case. Otherwise, I would have needed a good phone for all of the drops caused by this bad clip.I'm still looking for a good clip."
4,"Nice warm towels, but watch your electric bill!","There's nothing nicer than a warm, dry, towel. And in the summer this heater keeps towels from getting musty so quickly. But, our electric bill went up $40 per month and we didn't know why....until we unplugged the towel warmer. Now we plug it in long enough to dry the towels, or to heat them while we shower. Then we turn it off again. Other than being an electricity hog, this is a great product, and we love the feeling of being pampered and comforted with heated towels."
2,"Works, kinda.",Wish this would warm up the towels a bit more. It kinda works. Would have to really think hard if I wanted to purchase again.. as I would have 2nd thoughts. Doesnt really work as well as I had thought. Towels dont dry as fast as I would have thought.
3,"Ok, but",This works ok to dry damp towels and sweaters but does not warm towels enough to be of any use when you jump out of the shower. It looks very nice and has drawn a lot of comments from people who tour our new home.
4,Towel warmer,Keeps the towels nice and warm. Certainly not save around kids and old folks....the frame gets VERY HOT.
2,He doesn't understand a word he's singing...,"Andy's got a pretty voice, if it weren't for the muzaky arrangemets, you might be able to overlook the fact that Andy sounds as if he doesn't mean or understand anything he sings. He's clueless. He lacks the gift of understanding lyrics as jazz critic Will Friedwald once pointed out in his book Jazz Singing, thoug hhe's got a beautiful voice, try one of hsi all standard albums, this cd does have camp value, meaning this is so bad, it's almost good, great as background music for sipping martinis and smokin cigars."
4,Does good for the money!,"Very easy to use. For the price it does do a good job. Not razor sharp, but sharp. For the average person this will do just fine."
2,"Good, but won't last long","It is a great concept to sharp knives, and works great. However, it will not last longer than a couple years. The bars are metal and dipped with a diamond abrassive, so over time and with use the abrassive will wear off rendering the rods bare and useless."
1,New Diamond Vee - piece of junk,"I ordered the Diamond Vee sharpener to replace one I've had for years and years. The old one worked fine, just getting a bit shop worn and had a nick in it. Since the old one was such a great sharpener, I suspected the new one would be as well. Surprise, surprise! The new Diamond Vee is worthless. I think it may have actually dulled the blade. I tried to slice a tomato after sharpening a knife with the new Diamond Vee and it wouldn't nick the skin! I ran it over the old one a couple of strokes and it sliced the tomato like it was water! I think I will drop this baby in the trash where it belongs! Glad I didn't throw the old one out. I may keep it forever!"
2,Works well for a little while,"I received a new knife that had a badly rolled edge on it. Rather than sending it back I decided to get one of these and re-profile the edge myself. This was a hard steel alloy (S30V) so I knew it would take some effort. By the time I got the edge back to the proper angle, the diamond abrasive surface was completely worn away. I got one sharpening out of it for 30+ dollars. I think the sharpener will work well for soft 440 stainless knives like you have in your kitchen or your swiss army knife for quite a few uses, but forget about it for quality knife steel. The adhesive they use to bond the diamond dust to the rods is not strong enough."
4,Who knew?,"I like Jamie Kennedy's movies; I think he's a riot. However, I had never seen his standup. I saw this one on Showtime and I had to buy it. It starts a little slow, mostly due to the dry crowd, but then it gets going and keeps you laughing."
3,Who Sank the Boat?,A very easy read written for beginner readers. Story line is not very catchy. The book was a reccomendation from a sceince group as an introduction to bouyancy and density.
1,Who sank the Boat,"I can't rate the book, because I haven't received the book. Please send any information that will help me find my book."
1,Becalmed in ennui,"Like Forrester and O'Brian before her, Pamela Allen uses factual accounts of H.M Royal Navy during the age before steam to flesh out the bones of her fictional characters. Sadly, the flesh is meagre and quickly becomes a bloated bloodless corpse becalmed in a sea of ennui.Too often we see young childrens' book writers tackle great themes only to founder in their own syntax. Sadly, there are no great themes here, and Ms. Allen is not a young writer but an aged academic who has spent too much time in libraries and not enough on the Main, hoisting herself through the lubber's-hole over the futtock shrouds.Tales of Adventure on the high seas this ain't. Rather, a prolix insight into one man's wasted life in the cafeterias and chat-rooms of an East-Anglian polytechnic. Without any malice I would suggest the author make a sea-change and open a video shop."
5,Sweet and simple charm,"A friend told me all five of her kids adored Who Sank The Boat, and I can see why. My two-year-old and my four-year-old both love it, and fortunately it doesn't get annoying with multiple readings!The story is simple, quirky and charmingly told, and the illustrations are fantastic and funny. It's a hit in our house."
4,Poetry from Every Topic or Emotion Imaginable!,"Poetry kindles from your heart; it is music to the ears! The anthology includes many poems for special moments in life or visions of accomplishment! The poems are a way to share one's innermost thoughts and passions of the world. Check out ""A Blissful Morning Bay."" Author of...]Secrets of a Heart"
2,best of mountain,"I bought this cd in hoping I would get a idea what the group Mountain sounded like. The music is good but the sound quality of this cd is horrible. I would not recommend this paticular cd to anybody.Try the others that Mountain has recorded, this group is good, and deserves any classic rocker fan's attention."
3,Heavy Collection,"Mountain was an early 70s hard rock band that enjoyed a brief pop heyday with ""Mississippi Queen,"" easily their best song. Think of them as that era's Great White if you will. Let's face it, any band that includes a cover of a Chuck Berry standard on its ""Best Of"" album wasn't exactly shooting for complexity. That said, all the band's best stuff is here. Other than the hit and the Berry cover, the rest of it is relatively interchangeable. The CD booklet is quite spartan, containing little more than tiny snapshots of the band and a track listing.Overall, a reasonably complete and relatively concise anthology from a band that could only have achieved popularity in the pre punk era."
1,Not what is advertised,I ordered this item thinking it was a good deal at $24 a case of six. I ordered three cases at the stated price. When the package arrived there were only three bins and not three cases of six as advertised. When I called the company they stated that this was the individual price. So tell me who would pay $138 for a single bin which is their normal price on this item?
1,Not useful at all.,I was not able to satisfy my need with this cable. So it's a useless product for me. P.S: The cable is a really heavy!!
4,"Nice lights, hassle install",It's a nice set of lights that looks good. But the installation process could have been simplified with a bit more thought by the designers.
4,Came exactly as described,Item came exactly as described. Was in great shape with no writing or markings in it. Came quickly and stayed fully in tact the whole semester
2,Dissapointing Re-Edit,"During a recent discussion of erotic movies (not to be confused with Erotica) with a friend, we decided that this movie was one of our favorites and decided to order it. Having seen it only twice myself when it appeared on HBO in the late seventies, it remained in my memory as very erotic though not terribly well acted. The cut available (R rated) from this site is not the same cut I, nor my friend saw when viewed shortly after it's original release and I'm reasonably sure that even in it's raw, formative stages, HBO wasn't airing an X-rated version. If you're looking for the steamy, sexy version you remember, this aint it!"
4,Soft core classic,"This 1977 softcore extravaganza is one of the finest and most erotic softcore films ever made. Harlee McBride stars as Cynthia Chatterly, the title character of the film who after inheriting an estate decides to have sex with anything and everything that moves. The big shock of the film isn't the sex, it's the fact that the storyline is great for a softcore film, and the acting is as well. McBride and the chambermaids make this worth watching alone, and those who dig the good 'ol days of late night premium cable porn will love this classic."
4,Excellent Soft Porn,This was a well written soft porn..As we all know porn usually has no plot and is basicly stupid..But this movie has a plot and it has very seductive scenes..Fans of this kind of movie should be pleasantly please..
5,classically erotic,Very sexy and erotic movie. Harlee McBride is adorable as are the other women in the movie. Though it starts out a bit slow this helps to build the anticpation and the later scenes are worth the wait.
4,A good collector's item!,"I saw this movie when it used to come on cable. This was a very good movie. Harlee McBride can be rated up there with Sylvia Kristel (Emmanuelle), although Kristel has several sequels. McBride only has one sequel, which is very rare to find but is worth it. The sequel includes Adam West, remember Batman of 1966???"
3,Pretty good but the not the Original,this Film was So On time back in the day on Late Night Cable.but this Version seems cut up&loses Points for missing that Element that made it a Must see.Harlee Mcbride is a Babe.
5,Wonderful/Mellow Seventies Soft Core,"The 5 stars refers to the UNRATED version. This movie goes to show that you don't need hardcore; all of the time, in order to get turned on. The acting was 'top notch'. Everybody fit their roles perfectly. Harlee McBride is so damn sexy. She looks like a real woman, not a surgeon's creation. That is good to see once in a while. Actually, most all of the women in the film are hot. If you are looking for something erotic (from a time gone by) you can't go wrong here."
1,Not the original,I remember the original one well. This was highly censored and definitely had many parts edited or completely edited out.
3,Young Lady Chatterley,"I really enjoyed this unrated and racy movie, or at least the first half of it. It helps to get me in the mood.....and this is the part that I am rating. Its why I bought the movie.If I were to rate the last 30 minutes or so, I might drop it down to one star."
4,Running time,Great picture when I saw it as a VHS rental. Think it was average running time of 95-100 minutes and think it was unrated. All listing that I've seen say 141 minutes (which would be 2 hr 21 min.) Think they probably meant 1 hr and 41 min (101 min) but would like to verify if it really might be a longer running time than 101 minutes. Can anyone verify?
2,Terrible Synch,"I tried to watch this movie as an Unbox download but the audio synch was so far out of whack it drove me to distraction. I've watched enough poorly dubbed foreign flicks to have learned the trick of watching the actor's eyes instead of their lips, but that didn't help here. While the camera, for example, is focused on the lovely star of the film speaking to another actor one hears a phone ringing and hears the star say hello, then the frame switches to the phone (apparently ringing) which is then picked up and moved to the star's face while....arrgghhh! None of the reviews of the dvd I read mentioned this problem, so apparently it is just a Unbox issue, but since I use Unbox to preview movies I'm thinking of buying, this glitch will cost them a sale."
4,Toshiba's technical support was BIG problem,"I really liked my Toshiba Portage 3505 Tablet PC. It is a very light weight laptop with excellent features and functionality. The tablet functioned extremely well and was very touch sensitive. Sadly the monitor started to go out almost immediately and I was not able to get any help from tech support. When the monitor finally went out, not long after I got it, I was told, ""sorry, no warranty"" even though I had purchased the laptop brand new, directly from Toshiba. I found that to replace the monitor would cost as much as buying a new laptop. I agree with another reviewer who did not feel that Toshiba cared at all for their customers. I also never talked to a tech support person who seemed to understand basic English. I would gladly own another Toshiba laptop, especially to Portage Tablet PC, but only if I knew customer service would be provide better support."
4,Redman shines again.,"I was skeptical about a 'trio album' - but this album is recorded so well - and the playing is really top notch. Of course, the musicians are all elite - so high expectations are planted as well. I prefer the trio songs to the songs with guests. ""Back East"" is a highlight - as is ""East of the sun.""Redman's playing has rarely sounded better. So cohesive, filled with talent, and swinging hard. Smartly arranged compositions too - I like that. You can also smell that the songs were rehearsed but not over-rehearsed...Quite pleasing. Enjoy all..."
2,Fair cd,"Off the Mark & what I mean is wrong material. Doesnt show what his talents are. Id get George Benson, Bob James Nathan east, David Beniot, Peter white, Mark antione on your next cd & this would make a awesome Cd."
4,Surprisingly good,"Joshua Redman is hit or miss with me. I'm not really a fan of his elastic band stuff, so hearing him return to an acoustic format in a trio setting was a nice change for me. Each trio is unique and showcases each member in a different way - it's amazing how this stripped down format can stay interesting throughout the entire album. Recommended."
2,Interesting reading,"This is an odd jumble of of ""articles"" as Buddy calls them (80+ page/ page and a half pieces) on all aspects of the game. Most might make interesting magazine pieces, but there is very little new, tactical/strategic or game-specific information here. Again, entertaining, but the book has no guiding principle other than love of the game; it needs an organization and suffers from too many errors in grammar and spelling. I found it interesting, although repetitive (and with no illustrations), and it does have some wise words for the intermediate player who wants to improve his/her game."
2,darts,"I read on a website one time that there are three basic rules to becoming a good dart player, i've stuck to these rules and it has definatley has improved my game 1)PRACTICE 2)PRACTICE 3)PRACTICE , now get off your computer and get to it!"
1,Worthless,"This looked like a hard plastic toy ideal for our 8 mth old puppy. When we got it, it was a soft plastic he tore through in 5 minutes. The plastic was just glued to the tennis ball which he ripped apart in seconds. This was a big waste of money."
1,Don't always get want it looks like.,"This bone looked perfect for my dog, it looks like good hard bad plastic,Well don't be fooled and don't waste your money,the bone you get looks nothing like the picture. I got this cheap soft plastic one my dog had it chewed up in less then 5 minutes, shame on you for show something you won't be getting. I sure will not be taken by them again."
5,Bear Hunt,"Shanna is back with the crew: Shane, Tiger, Dinah, and Ducky to take children on a bear hunt. Dressed in hats and backpacks, they set out on their journey throughout the various rooms of the house in search of the bear.The story utilizes tools of all the First Reader Series: rhyme and rhythm, sight words, picture clues, phonics games, easy words, and large print. Each of these tools adds to the appeal of the story and assists in the early reading development of children. In addition, the author has done a great job of showcasing Shanna's house and what's included in each room.This is yet another story to add to reading lists everywhere, especially for those with young children who love reading out loud or being read to.Reviewed by Tee C. Royalof The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"
5,Battershell is alive and well and rocking,"Jess/goldfish7,I agree: Sunshine in Popopia is an awesome CD! (Make sure you check the secret track for a Blondie cover song). As far as Battershell's other work, Luv Punks, it is truly a great cd with 4 secret tracks...one of the best CD's to own. Battershell will also be in the soon to be released film entitled ""Lilith On Top""...it has video footage of their performance as the one and only luv punk band to play the Lilith Fair. Jess, look for the CD ""Luv Punks"" by Battershell on Canadian CD selling sites."
4,Kissess,"I bought these as a gift for my daughters bridal shower. I put them in a nice jar, and guests had to write down how many kisses they thought were in the jar. The person who came closest, won them!"
3,These ARE NOT custom fit,"I ordered a screen protector awhile ago that was perfectly fit for my Creatize Zen Vision M, even bordered correctly. After replacing them because of trapped dust four years later, I did not remember which company I purchased them from so I bought these off Amazon. As the title suggests, these are not custom fit. Horizontally, length was about 2"" too long and the width was about a .5"" off. This is not to say I easily cut and fit them myself, but the title of their product is misleading. I purchased these mainly because the two positive reviews, but I am beginning to believe we did not receive the same product. Product features and ease of use is described perfectly by other reviewers."
3,My son expected James to be bigger than Thomas,It works fine - but for Thomas aficionados James should be bigger than Thomas and the manufacturer seems to have just painted a Thomas red.... so this was not a Christmas hit sadly
1,TOO LEAKY!!!,As a nursing mother I researched many different brands of bottles to find the easiest one for my little one to make the transition. I read from so many sources that Soothie would make the transition the easiest for babies. I bought a starter kit and several other bottles. I was greatly dissapointed to learn that out of all the bottle that I purchased only one did not leak. I tried repositioning the nipple and I tried to tighten the lid. Nothing helped. My son was soaked everytime we tried to use them. I switched to another brand and now we are very dry.
2,"We love it, our son doesn't","The set up is by far the coolest I've seen. You can put formula in the bottom of the cups and just dump it in when it needs to be shaken up and made. Great for travelling right? However, our son hates these nipples. They are too flat and frustrated him, we had to buy another product and as he is 6 months old he still doesn't like them. We've tried a few times. There just doesn't leave much room for a natural suction as it's totally flat with a nipple sticking straight out. Also, there is no way to get rid of air in the bottle or to ensure your baby doesn't get air while eating. I wouldn't recommend this system to anyone, I don't know how babies eat out of these. The nipples make no natural sense and there are no other solution to a replacement as far as I have seen."
5,love them!,"I have this set and I absolutely love it! The cup that fits on the bottom of the bottle is super convenient! But just so you know, you can buy this set at walmart for $16.52! [...]"
1,Terrible leaking problem!,"I received these for a shower gift. Two of the three bottles leaked terribly, and when I e-mailed and called the company they basically said take them back to the store. Well, they'd been used!! No aplology, nothing! Very disappointed!"
2,Baby gets too much air,"I heard a lot of good reviews about this brand and love the pacifiers, but the bottles just aren't that great. The opening of the bottle is wide--great for pouring formula in--but it makes it really hard to feed. In order to get the last oz. in the bottle, you practically have to suffocate your baby because the nipple is in the center of this wide-mouthed bottle. So in order for fluid to get to the nipple, you have to tilt the bottle 90 degrees over the mouth of your baby. The result of this problem led to a lot of gas. This bottle might not be so bad if they made the the mouth of the bottle narrower or moved the the nipple away from center."
2,not designed well for newborns,"Cons:1) The nipple on the bottles are too big for newborns. My daughter's nose always looked as if it was being squished and she had difficulty breathing while feeding.2) To get the last ounce or so, you have to pretty much put the baby lying down to get the milk in the nipple. Lots of formula wasted!!3) My daughter always looked angry and frustrated while drinking and sucked in too much gas.4) Beware of the nipple flow! 2 nipples in this kit are a size 2 (not appropriate for newborns).Pros:1) The soothie is great.2) The bottles are wide and easy to clean.3) Probably better for older infants.My daughter is doing much better with the Playtex Advance bottles. I would recommend you try another alternative, especially if you want to reduce gas or refrain from feeding your child lying down for her to finish the last ounce."
4,"Love the pacifier, nipple not so much.","my daughter loves the soothie pacifier i think its her favorite (she cant tell me but she takes it more than the others :] ). i tried out the bottles and ive found the nipples dribble a little bit, not a lot but more than my gerber bottles. in my opinion thats the only downside of them. other than that they are really convenient because they come with a storage container that attaches to the bottle and you can store formula or little snacks. the shape is also confortable to hold in your hand. nice bottles!"
4,Helped my son feed better!,I was using gerber bottles until he started having a lot of problems eating from them for some reason. I tried these because they match his pacifiers and he has no prob sucking on those. I think it worked out very well he seems happier as am I. The little cups for the bottom are really a great idea it should come with more. They not only hook on the botton of the bottles but u can stick them all together and add a lid to the top and its a great snack holder.
2,not pleased,i own these bottles they seemed nice.but there is a design flaw with the nipples there are two pin sized holes on each nipple over time filth and germs built up in these holes they are imposible to clean.i didnt notice until one day i started seeing filth floating in the bottle.im thowing mine out.
2,Very Leaky,"I tried the Soothie bottle because my baby was having trouble deciding what bottle she liked. This bottle leaked a lot. I liked the size of the bottle because it was easy to hold, but the size also made it difficult to warm and keep fluid in the nipple when it runs low. My favorite bottles are the Dr. Browns and there is a Parents Choice one that is similar to Dr. Browns."
3,Great bottles... but nipple problems,"The only paci my daughter would take at all is the Soothie. So when the bottles came out I bought some. She loves the bottles and in general I think they are great. They do not leak, at least have not for me. The problem I have is somehow when she is drinking the nipple collapses inside the bottle and she winds up wearing all of the formula in it. The nipple is snuggly in place and the ring is as tight as I can get it. I do not understand why this is happening, I have never had any problems like this with other bottles."
2,LEAKY!!,"I bought these bottles because of all the positive online reviews. I also liked that they are easy to clean. I was VERY disappointed. These bottles are very leaky (moreso than the Avent). It was impossible to shake the bottle to mix the formula and not get it all over the place. The nipple is okay, but the stage 1 nipple flow is too fast and my daughter had problems eating. I switched back to the Playtex Vent Aire which is by far a superior bottle. There are more pieces to clean, but it's definitely worth it. I would not recommend the Soothie bottles."
4,"Good, but....","This is a good CD except that ""Love the One Your With"" is performed by the Isley Brothers not Stephen Stills. I bought this CD for that one song, the others were just a bonus. That is my only disappointment.More Than a Feeling - BostonAre You Ready? - Pacific Gas & ElectricI Can Help - Billy SwanIndian Reservation - The RaidersDevil Went Down to Ga - Charlie Daniels BandLady Marmalade - Patti LabelleAin't No Sunshine - Bill WithersMost Beautiful Girl - Charlie RichLove the One Your With - Isley BrothersBest of My Love - The EmotionsI hope this helps."
3,A Dark Land of the Mind,"Andorra is a compelling and beautifully written mystery. It is about a murder about to happen and one that already has happened, but it is mostly about forgetting and running away from a past that cannot be faced. La Plata is not a real place, but an ideal land to run to in your mind to live peacefully when the world becomes violent. Still the imagination which Mr Cameron uses to describe this fantasy land is powerful and descriptively beautiful. Amidst the grim background of the story there are surprisingly fun and quirky observations. Who would think to write an operatic version of The Immoralist? In this author's strange and surreal imaginary land people can give way to eccentricities in searching for an understanding of themselves and there are quite a few surprises that follow."
4,A misunderstood book,"I think the unfavorable reviews here have missed the point entirely. But to explain why I'd have to give away the ending and I don't want to do that. All I can say is, Pay attention to the last chapter! Then think about how the narrator's circumstances affect the story and its telling."
1,Camerondorra?,"Does Mr. Cameron have so little imagination that he has to use the name of my homeland, this little Country in the Pyrenées,to place the action of his novel? It should show a warning to the customers that could be tempted of buying the book: This book HAS NOTHING TO SEE WITH ANDORRA; neither geographically, etnographically or sociologically!"
2,Andorra,I was disappointed with this book as I thought it would be a factual description of Andorra. Instead it was a fiction based in Andorra. And not a particularly exciting fiction at that. Sorry.
2,I once read a book about Andorra....there's no there there.,"I just completed Peter Cameron's wiilow-o'the- wispy novel Andorra and am reminded of Gerturde Stein's description of her hometown. She could only say, ""There's no there there."" Mr. Cameron's tale of ""deceipt, desire and illusivenesss of memory"" reads more like a literary sleight of hand...all those words and nothing happened. His traveler's sad tale serves no reason to exist except as a pretext to get him out of one town and into another. The clingy annoying locals seem hopelessly stuck in place and when the whole thing is over I realized I've eaten a plate of chiffon without sugar."
2,But..,"I picked up this book in part because of my interest in Andorra. The flap piqued my interest. The plot was mildly ammusing, though ocassional tedious. My biggest problem remained the use of the name of an actual country, without use of the actually country side. (i.e. Andorra, the country, is land-locked and ""Andorra,"" the book, takes place by the sea.The plot became very reminiscent of ""Camera Obsura"" without the interesting facts and tidbits of data. And tords the end it seemed the author was trying to wrap up story lines without clear-cut reasoning.While every book is a learning experience, this was a bit of a let down."
2,A triumph of style over substance,"Cameron's prose is wonderful if hardly original. Sadly, the novel places all its bets on a narrative technique that fails utterly. The revelation at the end of the book is supposed to recast the entire first-person narrative but this is so heavily foreshadowed that I felt as if the author must believe his readers to be imbeciles. A shame, but I will give Cameron's next novel a try."
2,Good read - bad details!!,"A jolly romp but, having been to Andorra myself, I could not recognise the country; I do not remember any beaches nor do I remember a harbour - let alone onecapable of holding ""a few ostentatious yachts"".Andorra is high in the Pyrenees and is land-locked.I doubt if the author has ever been to Andorra.Also Mrs Reinhardt comes from the English countyof Barsetshire; which does not exist.If you're an American I suppose you'll enjoy it."
3,Charming and fluffy. I wanted more substance at the end.,"I wanted more from the secondary characters in Andorra. And I wanted more character from the main character. It was a good read, but hardly a masterful novel. It's been a year since I read the book, the details have faded. However I remember enjoying the picture he painted of a country most people in the world don't know about. I know it was a novel though, so I didn't expect fact. By the end I was drawn into his mystery, cheering for his character and hoping that everything would turn out right in the end. I still contend that the secondary characters needed to be more robust, and the mystery needed to be less subtle."
3,Intriguing little story for summer reading,This is an enjoyable book in a fantasy land about a rather elusive character and those he encounters - perfect for beach reading.
2,"SKIP THIS FOR THE RAVEN IMPORT, FAR BETTER AUDIO","This is, of course, by far the biggest selling Hollies ""best of"" disc.However, a much better-sounding alternative import single-disc compilation,On a Carousel, 1963-1974: The Ultimate Hollies, made available by Australia's Raven Records label.The remastered audio on the Raven disc is far and away superior to this disc, even though it was re-vamped just a few years ago.The Raven CD has every track on this disc, but has nearly double the music, 25 tracks vs. the paltry 13 here.The import is a little extra money, but eminently more worth it."
3,"What! No ""I'm Alive?"" No ""I Can't Let Go?""","Who picked these tunes? No ""I'm Alive?"" No ""I Can't Let Go?"" Come on now. Somebody else needs to pick greatest hit selections for the Hollies. OK, at least there is ""Carrie Anne"" and ""Look Through Any Window."" And ""He Ain't Heavy."" These songs are wonderful to hear and very good quality."
3,The Hollies' Greatest (radio edit) Hits,"I was let down to hear ""Long Dark Road"" is the shorter radio edit. And what a bad edit it is! What could the people at Epic have been thinking? I've recently purchased the new Hollie's compilation CD, and it's much better, more complete AND includes the LP version of LDR."
2,Not All Inclusive,This contains only a few of their hits. There are better and more complete anthologies out there. This is for the rookie listener only.
4,frontporchbanjopicker,"This is basically a snapshot from the Hollies top 40 career, I prefer EMI`s out-of-print mini box set version from a decade ago, even the mastering is better. However, if you want a quick dose of the Hollies, this is the CD to own."
2,Disappointed!!,"This was, what I thought would be, the Hollies collection that I have always wanted.... but I was mistaken... The selection of songs is ""GREAT,"" but the SOUND is HORRIBLE!! This must be recorded from an ""OLD"" collection, and to make matters worse, I purchased 8 COPIES to give as Christmas Gifts (get it, ""Holly?"" = ""Hollies?"" - Well, sort of...) I WISH that I had purchased the NEWER (I guess) Collection, 2-disks, light-blue cover with the clouds?? - I still have the 7 copies UNOPENED, if I could possibly TRADE??? Rick"
5,Greatest Hollies Hits-Great Listening!,"I loved the Hollies' music in High School & wanted to add their music to my collection. This Greatest Hits CD was a great choice for me. It has all the songs I remember as well as some others I don't, but enjoy now!"
5,A Quick Overview,"The Hollies were one of my favorite British Invasion bands. This CD presents a baker's dozen of their hits. The sound quality is good and the song selection is uniformly great. The only problem is the version of ""Look Through Any Window"" included here is an alternate mix from a British EP and not the hit single version. It includes harmonized o-o-o-o-s sung over the 'middle eight' and the ending guitar. Other than that one flaw,this is a great compilation at a great price for the casual Hollies fan."
4,Love it!,"This is a great little collection of the Hollies greatest hits. By no means is it complete, but if you are looking for just a taste of the sweet British-Invasion hits that you loved way back when, you'll find it's worth the money."
4,Nice CD,"It's a nice CD, that covers a wide sample of their work.It's a perfect gift for a person that isn't a fan of Hollies, but like this music."
3,It's ok - but not really.,The product was ok - but not new as stated in the seller's description. Although it included the correct box - the item did not have the foam sleeve that Waterford items have in the box. It was simply wrapped in bubble wrap with Waterford tissue paper.
5,Very well done!!,"This is a must read for everyone who loves America and is interested in what is going on around the country. Though fiction, several feasable points are made. The author has really put in a lot of research time to make this book as realistic as possible."
4,A well regulated Militia,"This was a well written book that really strikes as true to character, especially when one considers what is really happening in the U.S.A. lately.My only concern was the sometimes colorful language!Great story!"
5,American Citizens take note!,"John Carpenter has writen probably the most realistic book I have ever read on the problems along our border with Mexico. Looking at it from both the American and Mexican side he has highlighted many problems not commonly reported by the media and thus unknown by the average American. Adding a highly plausable connection with Islamic Jehadism to this situation captives the reader with the realization that his story is not only possible, but under certain circumstnces, highly likely. Current events since his writing have born out many of his conclusion in the book. This book is well worth your time, if for no other reason than to direct your attention to a real world situation threatening both of our countries."
4,Excellent Intermediate Reader,This is a great book if you are a Spanish teacher. It works well with just about any curriculum. Mayan Safari teaches culture while reinforcing reading skills in the target language. It also contains extra activities for students to do.
1,Zero stars not possible?,"Who wrote this crap? Go about 1,000 miles past lame and you'll find this movie. Negative 10 on a scale of 1 to 10."
3,Michael Shanks,"Like another reviewer, just watched because Michael Shanks was in the move. Liked his part, kept me entertained on a rainy evening."
3,ok at best,"Ya, this had a little bit of good fighting and gun fighting ,but not the best film . The good thing was it was free"
1,Horrible Movie,I am a huge Steve Austin Fan and I was extremly dissappointed in this movie. The acting was horrible and the some of the scenes were over emphasized and should not have been. Dont waste your money on this movie.
2,Boring,From scene one the movie goes on to build the ultra tough machismo cop picture around Steve Austin which does not make sense at all is it is far from reality. Movies like this are made just to fool people into watching them because of the brand/name of the lead actor.
4,A no-brainer,"Stone Cold stars as Tate, leader of a group of comically badass SWAT team, has his team having to do training exercises in an abandoned warehouse after the chief doesn't care for their comically badass shenanigans in a recent hostage situation. Once there they find themselves dealing with unexpected mobsters without bullets.This film is ridiculous with a capital R, but it's also entertaining in a b-grade, brainless popcorn action flick, a genre that has sadly been on a steady decline since the glorious '80's (talking about quantity not necessarily quality). This is an unrepentant action movie with no pretenses and I can appreciate that."
1,Rose fell off of charm base within days,Rose fell off of charm base within days of placing it on charm bracelet. I have ordered from Pugster many times and these it the first item I have had a bad experience with Pugster. I was very disappointed about this charm as it was a gift to my sister at Christmas for her bracelet.
4,Three Points!,"this book is one for action loving DL fans. although it's a little hard to get into, once you reach about page 100, you'll probally experiance problems putting it down."
4,"No Relation, But Still Good","To begin, I agree with all those who say it was not a history. It's just not. The story couldn't have influenced the Dargonesti in any way, because it says in the book that Uriona and her followers broke off from the Dargonesti. Still this was a great book. I liked Vixa and Speaker Elendar. I also enjoyed the fact that Vixa was the daughter of Kemian Ambrodel and Verhanna Kanan. This confirmed my suspicions from The Qualinesti that they married.Overall, great book, good characters and great ending."
3,A tenative 3 stars...,"This book irritated me. The thing keeping it from two stars was the fact that I was interested in the relationship between Vixa and Naxos. I was a bit disappointed...maybe because I had higher expectations for the book. Anyway...The book never really held my interest; the only person that was truly enigmatic to me was Naxos and possibly the Queen. Still...As far as books about elves go, compared to some, this is action-packed. (Really, myself, I lost track of the rather tediously redundant battles...They kind of blur when the same things happen again and again). Some things are interesting, though I don't think knowing about sea elves (and this book is written mostly from a ""land"" elf's point of view, so you don't see too much of their minds) is exactly relevant. Well...Those were my two cents. Don't say I didn't warn you."
3,It's ok I guess,"Well... the book was pretty well written, and contained alot of action and information... but it did have some major flaws. For instance, whenever you start to like a character, they die... whenever you feel that something climatic is about to happen, someone dies or something explodes and that's about the end of it. In the end, read it only if you have a morbid fasination with Sea Elves."
4,It was Monumentally Exelent,"The book The Dargonesti, by Tonya Cook and Paul B. Thompson, is a book about an ancient race of elves that started living at the bottom of the ocean a few thousand years ago. A Queen that knows a little bit of magic and is bent on ruling the world rules this ancient race, the Dargonesti. They capture other intelligent land creatures to be their slaves and build a wall for them to protect them from a race of semi intelligent crustaceans that are in a constant war with them.I liked this book a lot because when I read it, it was reminded of humans and the lost world of Atlantis. Also, the fact that the book is one exiting adventure with magic and mystical creatures won me over."
5,The story is about a princess trying to save her country.,"The plot was good if you like storys with fantasy characters like elves, dwarfs, mages, and more. If you don't like storys with plots trying to save their country with characters of what I have listed, this may not be a book for you. The story is that a princess, Vixa and her friends are trying to save her country from intruders. On the way there, they got lost and find them selves on an uncharted island. There on the island they encounter many stranges things, meet a race of sea elves, and confronted a new foe. The book deals with some elements from D&D(Dungeon&Dragons) a game with fantasy characters on a mission or trying to reach a place that you can play with a group of friends."
1,yawn-erific,"The title of this book was obviously meant to be spelled 'Turd' as that is what it is, a waste of paper and a waste of time, how many trees were cut down for this dated, boring, tired and common piece of garbage. OK Mr Carson, we get it now, move on! It's books and designers like this man that stop the moving forward of new ideas and new work and new artists, the time and money that was spent publishing this would have been better spent on an emerging talented graphic designer. Why is anyone still giving this awful man any work?"
1,Cotton Candy,"Nothing new here... except maybe the over the top self reverential entries... a page from a past calendar logging his world tour espousing his personal greatness in the design world and a picture of him paddling out from his home in paradise... with quotes about how meaningful it is to be a god of design... arrogant self serving propoganda in a flashy package... Trek is like cotton candy it looks enticing and mouthwatering from a distance but once you get ahold of it, your joy is shortlived... its a sticky, sugary, syrupy mess that winds up in the trash after a few bites... Carson is old news... repetitive and trite... for real bleeding edge design thats not old news try AREA from Phaidon now thats substance."
2,Overblown,"If you are going to buy a book about David Carson's work, buy The End of Print. This effort pales in comparison and feels much less inspired and much more contrived."
5,HEART FRIENDLY,"I HAVE BEEN TAKING HAWTHOWRN SUPREME FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS. IT HELPS MY TACCHYCARDIA (RAPID HEART BEAT). UNLIKE SOME MEDICATIONS, IT HAS A POSITIVE EFFECT ON MY HEART - IT IMPROVES ITS STRENGTH. I PLAN TO TAKE IT THE REST OF MY LIFE. I AM 81 YEARS OLD. PRESENTLY, I PURCHASE MY SUPPLY FROM AMAZON BECAUSE IT HAS THE BEST PRICE."
5,"Sweet, very well written Americana","HEM's first album ""Rabbit Songs"" was the kind of album you'd expect from a character from an Aaron Copeland symphony. ""Eveningland"" is a bit more pop, but still firmly within the Americana genre. HEM has a real knack for writing honest, accessible, and melodic songs that manage to feel like familiar old folk songs while avoiding cliches. The arrangements on ""Eveningland"" are lush, the songwriting is very solid, and performance is endearing. This album is a very romantic, intimate collection of songs, and to me ""Fire Thief"", ""Lucky"", and the cover of the Johnny Cash/June Carter tune ""Jackson"" are the standouts.I bought this album twice (the first was stolen in a car break in), and I'd buy it again to make sure it's always in my collection."
4,Folk at it's best,"Eveningland and The Rabbit Songs both possess a melodic sincerity to them that never slides into sentimentality, i.e. Emo and any country music written after 1974). It is American music used to its best affect: examining the interiors of the soul for the young and rapturous of heart. I would also recommend Wilco's first four and Neko Case's last two albums.-Enjoy."
3,Musical Comfort Food,"Eveningland is a nice album, but it lacks the originality that made me fall absolutely in LOVE with Rabbit Songs. The melodies aren't as striking, and the arrangements drift towards pablum. Still, it's quite listenable and unoffensive--kind of the musical equivalent of mashed potatoes--comforting and familiar, but nothing compared to the creative ""gourmet"" experience that was Hem's first album. Fortunately there's still Sally's exquisite vocals."
5,Hem come into their own in this album,They become more of the band they were trying to emulate in their previous CD.
4,Great mellow album,"I got this after hearing their song on the Liberty Mutal commercial, but this album really isn't anything like that song (not that that's a bad thing). I feel like it's Eastmountainsouth meets the Carpenters--beautiful vocals and harmonies with mellow 70's-style beats (I love both of those bands so that's not meant to be anything but a compliment). It's definitely not ""get up and dance"" music, but it's great music to have in the background or for when you just want to relax. Definitely surprised by their rendition of ""Jackson,"" but it was a nice alternative to Johnny & June. ""My Father's Waltz"" is my favorite thus far, even though it's one of the shorter tunes. Overall, a really good addition to my music library!"
1,betrayed to sell a book,Linda Lael Miller and Fern Michaels are established and good storytellers. Their stories are predictable but written well enough and an enjoyable read. It's too bad that the Fern Michaels story is OLD and the 1st two authors featured appear to be placed to sell their (upcoming) books.....and they cannot approach Miller and Michaels in quality of writing nor story.
5,Happy to have found this product.,It seemed to me that these sandwich bags were no longer being made until I found them on Amazon. I've been using them for years and there's no substitute. They hold more than zip locks of the same size and easier to manage.
4,A VERY UNDERRATED MOVIE!!,"Sandlot 3 went in a totally new direction, part 1&2 were to much the same.This movie is a very good family movie, remember back when you were a kid and you played on some old run down field, but you loved it cause you spent most of your childhood playing sports on it I do.I guess I'm a sucker for movies that remind me of life before the internet & cell phones.I rate this DVD a 5 of 5 stars!!"
5,sandlot 3,Sandlot 3 is as great n amusing as 1 and 2. My son could not tear his eyes away. Very entertaining. This is what taught him how to play and love baseball.
4,great old movie,"great movie for kids of all ages reminded me of all the old good american kids movies ,will watch many times over"
4,Great monitor for the price,"My wife loves this monitor, which replace her Sony 17"" CRT. The screen size is just slightly smaller. Great for the price!"
4,"ok monitor,less at wm","wm has it for 144.77,without speakers.built in speakers are junk anyway.response time is my only gripe,some ghosting.mine had no dead/stuck pixels.for the wm price,it's a good deal."
5,"Tasty, Heavy, Funky, Earthy, Free!!!","This follow-up to ""Blowtorch Consequence"" treads decidedly new ground, with a few tunes like ""Long Black Motorcade"" reminiscent of that earlier sonic masterpiece. Blue Collar, Black Future is an amazing amalgamation of tones, styles, sounds, and sensibilities all lending themselves to organic musical structures and a satisfying gritty edge. From the softest jazz to the most abrupt and mesmerizing noisecore, this album will tantalize you. Forget about genres! You will tape your CD player closed once you have this beauty within!!!!"
5,just what I was looking for!!!!!!!!!,they have a unique sound that I think america would love. It is about time a band sounds different than everyone else! they need to get recognized!!
3,Necessary Item,"We're ready for next year! There are no more words to describe this product. GOOD BYE, GOOD LUCK & SEE YOU NEXT TIME."
1,Too complex and unreliable,Ineffective and requires buying expensive wasteful little cartridges to maintain the unit. Even when it was 'working' properly it caught very few mosquitoes. I estimate about a dollar per mosquito since I've purchased it. MM is a big waste of money
5,This gun is awesome!!!!,"I bought this gun in a kit with a mask, hopper, 2 ball holders, a game flag, barrel squeegee, and a barrel plug for cheap! I thought it was going to be a cheap gun that didn't work well but it's awesome!!! It fires fast, it's pretty accurate and it's light. The only thing is that it's pretty loud but who cares. Sure you can buy a $400.00 gun that would destroy this one but for the price you cannot beat it!"
2,Not Good,This marker is unacurate and cant even shoot to the other side of the field. I gave it 2 stars because it shoots.
5,Great classic rock album - Highly recommended!,"I never buy CDs anymore, but paid $20 for this disc because it's still not on iTunes... and am so glad I did. It's a great playlist of rootsy classic rock songs, from the opening tune about the Pauite round dance, to the hit ""Come And Get Your Love"" down to the closing track ""23rd and Mad."" Then I started to pick up their other cds - and found a lot more to like there too. Redbone's catalog is a wonderfully fertile collection of great classic rock, especially this album. Get into it!"
2,"OK suit, runs small","My main disappointment with this suit is I ordered a size 6X for my size 5-6 daughter and it is WAY too small. Looks equivalent to a sz 4. We will not be able to use it. Fabric is a little thin, but kids grow so fast she may have outgrown it before it wore out anyway. I didn't know it wouldn't fit on arrival. Disappointing, because it is a very cute suit. Order 2 sizes LARGER, at least."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Radation and Rexes.The Doctor and UNIT investigate when an underground nuclear research facility begins having serious problems.Generally in this setting you wouldn't expect dinosaurs and a race of non-humans from before the dawn of man to be around, but this is what they have to contend with.The book is a little different in that it shows some of it from the non-human point of view."
5,Kerman & Irstan,"Kerman and Irstan is available, although it is a 2nd union on full view 2. Publication is via Worth Publishers."
3,"[Three and a half stars out of Four] Great video with classic NFL game footage when the League was good! Ode 2 Don Meredith, etc","Don Meredith was more than just 'Banjo Hackett,roamin' Free' or a plugman for Lipton Tea. 'Hh-mmm Good' (or was that Andy Griffith on Ritzcrackers?) Joe Namath is more than just a panty-hose wearing ad huckster, too. See this video,Super Bowl III, The Ice Bowl and the firstNFL Films 'greatest' compilation. The Leaguehas gotten too big and Peyton and Eli Manningare no Roger Staubach's or Broadway Joe's!!!!"
5,More wonderfulness,"The band and the songwriter evolve from adolescence to explore the world on their own terms. The songs are like old friends, the characters like neighbors. Musically inspiring by just the right touch of tuba, glockenspiel, accordion into the rock genre. It's a fun carnival ride."
5,Best album in the entire universe & history of mankind,"This is the best album in the entire universe & history of mankind. If you don't buy this album and listen to: Kittys Back, Rosalita, New York City Serenade, then your life will be meaningless and you will never know true love and probably get scabies. I'm not kidding. I'm really not. Not even a little. And chicks really dig this music. If you listen to it, they will come."
5,Can I give it more than 5 stars???,I'm from Philly so I've been listening to Bruce for 30+ years.'Rosalita' was the first song of his I remember hearing on WMMR(probably 'Hungry' Ed Schiaky's show...). There's a part about halfway in where The Big Man hits a sax break. It caused the hair to stand up on the back of my neck. How do I remember that? 'Cause I got the same feeling listening to it this morning and everytime I've heard it since approx 1972.....Plain & Simple. This album is what rock & roll is all about.
3,Great Music But Lousy Fidelity.,"It's a shame that this album has never been remastered to bring the sound quality up to what it could and should be. The music itself rates 5-stars, but because the album was never remastered, the quality of the sound rates 2-stars. To me, it is amazing that an artist of Springsteen's stature and accomplishment has allowed this inferior product to remain in its current condition. I keep waiting for it to be upgraded so I can buy it and hear it as it deserves to be heard."
3,"Not great, but good","This isn't a bad album, but not one of my favorites from The Boss. It's better than Greetings from Asbury Park, NJ, but pales in comparison to his later albums. The best songs on this album are Rosalita and Fourth of July, Asbury Park (Sandy). Both of those are very catchy tunes."
2,For completists only,"Sure, Rosilita is a fun tune, but nothing here compares to the Bruce of Born to Run, Darkness on the Edge of Town, Nebraska, or Tunnel of Love. If you already own all of those, though, this is a cheaper Bruce-dose than The River or Human Touch, and has about the same percentage of great songs."
2,Sorry.................,"I know many of you diehard Bruce fans rate this album high but.............. I think at this point in his career he was lacking musical direction. This album shows. Sure, it includes the classic ""roseletta"" but that's about it. He tries to jazz, tries to be like Dylan. Some of the lyrics are bad too. If you're a diehard buy it, but if you are a newbee to Bruce get ""born to run"" or ""darkness at the edge of town""."
3,OK for the price,"It's OK for causal play. The surfaces is a little too hard which will cause a little too much bounce and harder to control the ball. You may also want to sand where thumb and index finger grib, because just after 5 minutes play I felt the rough surface which caused a little uncomfortableness on hand. BTW, I'm from China and a good pingpong player (not professional though)."
2,Read description carefully,"Wish I had read the description more closely than relying on photo. I thought this was a smooth surfaced paddle. Description clearly indicates the pips out face, but I ordered with only looking at photo :("
2,Plays OK but needed repairs right away,"I just bought my first ping pong table and it is used primarily by young kids playing their first games of ping pong. Given those facts, I wanted cheap paddles to get the kids started on. I bought 4 paddles. 3 of them are great. The 4th had a big flap of paddle rubber peeling back when I opened it. I glued it back and now it seems fine. That was a lot less hassle then packing it up for a return but it's not that cool to open a brand new paddle and find it defective. I hope my glue job stands up to the beating my twins will give this paddle."
5,Great Paddles,"I would definitely recommend these for rec rooms and amateur tournament's. Great spin, sturdy, and cheap."
1,Poorly made,The tape and wrapping on the handle began to come apart literally before I finished playing the first game with this paddle. Product was not made to use at all.
2,Not for use in humid / wet climates,"These look nice, but don't leave them outside in Florida. The glue gave up on the handles on the two I got in the first few weeks. I would not recommend these for outdoor use unless you are willing to reglue the handles together with some decent wood glue. After repairing them they are fine."
3,size wise,"I was initially interested in purchasing a 8'x16' mat for use in a storage shed. These garage mats seemed to be the perfect fit. However, no-where on the web could I find the dimensions of this mat. In emailing the manufacturing company, I find the dimensions of CARPAD 119078 liner are 6.5' x 19' which are smaller then I expected.Hope this will help others in their purchase."
4,great movie,I love to get these old movies in DVD. I would order again from this sight. Product was in good condition.
4,Dylan Soundtrack,"Bob Dylan made his acting debut as Alias in Sam Peckenpaugh's Pat Garrett & Billy The Kid. In addition to acting, Mr. Dylan provided the songs for the soundtrack. In fact, its one song from the soundtrack that has become infinitely more famous than the movie itself. The song is one of the all-time best from a man who many consider the voice of a generation. The song is of course ""Knockin' On Heaven's Door"" and its power is undeniable. The song conveys the fears and confusion of both men of good (Pat Garrett) and bad (Billy The Kid) and it shows that no matter how you live your life, the specter and fear of death creeps into us all. There are some decent instrumentals and four versions of the song ""Billy"" which are good, but the album is really carried by one song."
4,Beautiful Instrumentals and Cowboy Ballads,"A terrific soundtrack featuring such excellent musicians as Roger McGuinn, Jim Keltner, Booker T, and Bruce Langhorn, guitarist on some of Dylan's most famous mid-60s work.With its mix of acoustic guitars, bongos, cellos, flutes, and tambourine, ""Pat Garrett"" sounds like nothing else I've heard.The four different versions of ""Billy"" are all quite different -- one is instrumental, and the other three are done with varying lyrics, instrumentation and tempos.And finally, ""River Theme"" and ""Final Theme"" are two of the prettiest songs I know of."
1,it fell apart trying to get it out of the box!,"Shoddy construction,,,,,,As i was pulling the item out of the box, it fell apart in my hands.(the area where notes etc go)' looking at the construction, i saw it was held together with only very tiny little nails and believe that the normal shifting of the unit on the desk, would only contribute to it falling apart sooner or later - most likely sooner.It never left the box before i sent it back......"
1,Broken on arrival,"The desk organizer was broken in two pieces on arrival. It appeared to be made of pressed board, not wood....cheap. Sent it back for full refund. Can't say enough good about amazon's customer service."
3,Its ok............not great,I had a Dr Scholl before but it wore out and so I got this oneIt is nice....don't get me wrong but it does NOT pulsate the lower and upper back enough.I've tried adjusting the position of it and still not so goodIt has nothing to do with my height.....its just not very powerful.
2,Too good to be true,"I used the previous reviews before buying this which were really useful.The product was awesome for the first two weeks, then the padding must have softened up or something, as the vibrator/motor? in the back pad really started to protrude through & feel really uncomfortable on my spine, even when switched off (not in use). It's too uncomfortable to use now, shame as until then it seemed awesome.I guess you get what you pay for something! Next time i'd probably research and invest a lot more $'s in one."
1,Heated seat,"My heated seat stopped working. I thought this would suffice. Made sit higher, which I didn't like and the heat didn't work. The massage was wonderfull tho."
1,Disappointed,This product was a gift for my wife. While the vibrating back worked the heated portion did not. I of course had to send it back and have not heard from anyone as to how I will be compensated.
2,Not fully functional... :(,"Bought this as a gift, the heat never worked... and that was the main reason I bought it. ""Massage/vibrate"" function did work though. Too much of a hassle to repack and ship things back sometimes..."
2,Heating doesn't work properly.,The massager works fine but heating doesn't work. It doesn't get heated even after keeping it on for hours.I wouldn't recommend this product for it's heating feature.
2,disappointed,We got this as a gift for a friend. When she used it the massager part worked great but the heating element did not even come on at all. Looking for a new brand.
1,Too much vibration!,"I had to return this product because while I liked the heat component the vibration was more annoying than helpful. It does have a few sections that you can individually select to vibrate, but I found with even just one on it was too much for my sensitive body. I also found the vibration pads in the seat under my thigh were large enough to be noticeable to me, making my legs feel lifted uncomfortably."
4,massaging/heated car seat,"I was surprised to see that this item performs better than I expected it to. I purchased a similar seat from another company a few years ago and it cost a lot more than this one. It was ok, but didn't last long. The heated seat and the massagers on the new seat work. The heat 'heats up' in a very short time. The massaging motors are good. The product is a 'good buy' for the price that it cost. I would recommend this product. The only negative thing is that the seat really doesn't adhere easily to bucket seats which are already in a car and it is a bit of a hassle installing it.djk"
3,Returned!,I returned it because it wouldn't turn off when you remove the weight and I was afraid it would drain my car battery if I forget to turn it off.
2,No depth; nothing substantial,"I flew through the book in about 2 hours. The author offers no real depth into the causes of the problems related to the sinking eroding bayou country. This is mostly a personal uninteresting account of travels through the area. If you want accurate well researched information related to the Mississippi and it's flood plain and delta, read Rising Tide by John Barry."
5,an eye-opener,"As a resident of Louisiana, I've often heard the term 'coastal erosion' thrown around in the news, but I never really knew enough to be concerned. However, this book brought to light the incredible scale of the situation, and the urgency required to save the coast of Louisiana. ""Bayou Farewell"" explains how Louisiana is disappearing at a rate of 25 square miles per year, and at the same time reveals the Cajun people and culture endangered by this very problem. This book is a must-read for any citizen of Louisiana or the United States, as something must be done before it is too late."
5,A Must Read in the Wake of Katrina,"Mike Tidwell weaves his real-life story about a fast disappearing people, their land, and their way of life. The story chronicles the root causes of the destruction of the Lousiana coast in poignant detail - the taming of the Mississippi and the canals of the oil industry, that are resulting in the slow death of the vast wetlands and marches that once comprised a great river delta.The destruction of New Orleans by Katrina was aided in no small measure by the loss of these wetlands which would have shielded the city from the worst of the tidal surges. Building higher levees is not the solution to New Orlean's or Lousiana's problems. They treat the symptoms but not the causes of the city's destruction. New Orleans is a sinking city and it cannot be saved by higher levees - levees have reached a point of diminishing returns. Only a controlled diversion of the river to rebuild the marshes and and the coast will ensure a future for the city."
4,Bayou Farewell,"I found this book to be very informative, easy to read and although the message at times is very sobering, the human interest stories are heart warming. I recommend this book to anyone with an interest in learning about the plight of the Mississippi Delta ecology, what is needed to restore it and the Cajun culture so intergral a part of this region for the last 300 years.Tom Papandrew - Architect and Landscape ArchitectHonolulu, Hawaii"
4,Bayou Farewell by Mike Tidwell,"Entertainingly written oddessy of the authors' adventures of discovery in the wetlands and bayous of rural Louisiana. This is also a shocking revelation of the tragic situation in Louisiana, generally overlooked in the general pursuit of ecological disasters. Because of the mining of oil and water under the wetlands and the loss of annual flooding, with its renewal of soil due to chanelling of the Mississippi River by levees and canals, as acres and acres of wetland have rapidly sunk under the ocean. Although the book was written before hurricane Katrina, we are now aware of the wall of water that rushed across the lost barriers to flood New Orleans and the rural areas surrounding it. The book is a call to awareness and and urge to remedy the situation."
3,Book has an error,"It claims the film The Jazz Singer was made in 1929. WRONG! It was made in 1927 by Warner Bros. As for the rest of the book. Well, is Olivier a homosexual or bi-sexual if he was married to Vivien and went briefly with a man? Sinful either way!"
4,ash bucket and shovel,"The bucket is heavy enough and nice and deep. Holds a lot of ash from our fireplace wood burning insert. The only thing I would change is to provide a shovel with a little longer handle. It's hard to reach clear to the back to clean the insert. But considering that it's the same shovel that we already owned, I don't consider this enough of a downfall NOT to buy this combo product."
1,ash bucket,"i wasnt happy with this ash bucket, it came with big dent, the medal is so thin i dont think its gonna last very long, the only reason i kept it is because i was taking it to my camp and didnt have time to return it. it also has a handle that isnt hooked very good to the bucket. very cheap made. junk if your gonna use it often."
3,Ash Bucket and Shovel Kit,"This set is okay...nothing fancy about it. The first set I ordered had two dents in the can. Amazom was very quick to send a replacement set, however, this set also had a good size dent in the side of the can. Hmmmm...don't know if I should try a third time.Update: Amazon sent another replacemnet overnight. It arrived in perfect condition. Return and replacement was not difficult at all."
3,mediocre,"this is a cute little ash bin, but the metal of the bin and its handle are disappointingly thin and flimsy. the shovel is somewhat more substantial, but it is cheaply fashioned with unfinished edges.the most annoying thing is there's no ""holder"" on the side of the bin for the shovel - the shovel just has to be propped up randomly by itself or it gets lost. a simple hook to keep the pair together would have been helpful.it does the job, but the design could have been more efficient."
5,Bang for your buck,"My son has tried many mouthpieces ranging from over $250 to $30. The one that gave him the most pleasing, clean sound that he was looking for was this one and it happened to be the least expensive. We ended up buying a second one so he could have one at home and one at school and not have to take the bari back and forth. This is a great product and I would recommend skipping the expensive mouthpieces, they don't give you any better quality!"
5,This Product is amazing,This product came in a new box at half the cost of a mouthpiece bought in a local music shop and it works beautifully.
1,Lousy cheap product,"This product is a waste of money, it is a plastic sheet with garden hose running through it. Don't be fooled by the misleading technical details. The good news is that it shipped quickly and it was folded up real nice. Garden hose was high quality green hose."
1,WAY OVER PRICED!!!,"This is nothing more then a very thin plastic tarp that tares easily. You are better off spending $10 at Home Depot for a tarp and $7 for a garden hose and making the same thing yourself, which would be much more durable and far cheaper. Esthetically this car mat is nicer but fairly priced, only worth about $20 retail."
4,Exciting epic with some flaws,"There is no doubt that Caidin has knowledge of space and different fields. Sometimes, his extrapolations are farfetched but most of the times they are right on the money.The story is well paced but I feel that the end came a little too fast. Was it supposed to be a 800 page book?Anyway, we understand his point about a new beginning and there is plenty of anecdotes in this book about the best and the worst that the human race can do.It would have made a good movie. I hope a producer picks it up."
3,The end of our Earth and the hope of a second chance.,"Exit Earth is an interesting tale of the distruction of earth and the atempt of the human race to save itself from certain disaster. Filled with great characters and inspiring events, this epic fills out the genre with style but often looses its contininuity. Caidin works too hard to complete this work and forgets that the reader has yet to reach the end. A good story and some realy good imagary, but the ending comes too quick for the amount of pages that it took to build up to it (600+ pages paperback)."
1,Exit Reader,"Juvenile drivel, with hard-bodied characters that have names like Marc, Corey, Zack, etc., who manage to stop the world's drug trade in the process of acquiring billions to fund a moon base, save humanity, etc. etc. etc. ad nauseum, all done while listening to 1000 watts of Vangelis and Kitaro music. New age tripe for today's computer headbangers. Ugh."
4,Dark and twisted,4 of the 5 stories here are AWESOME. One sucks. In Juicy' opinion Zoo the short listed as the Title is the weakest. But holy crap the others are great storytelling on the dark side. WARNING the cover has nothing to do with the shorts. If you are looking at this than you probably don't mind subtitles and already are into j-horror. This is like a Creepshow for the Japanese and well worth the few bucks. No gore. Only 4 stars cause only 4 of 5 stories were good to Juicy at least.
1,Only lasted 2 years,"It's cheap, yes, but for a reason. It ripped after 2 years. So if you want to pay only a little but have to replace, this is fine. Otherwise, opt for a more durable, more expensive tarp."
2,"cheap material, doesn't last long","This tarp had the right dimensions for our play structure, so it was perfect - at first....After only one and half seasons of sun and rain, the material deteriorated to the point that it was tearing in various areas and falling apart. Is this to be expected from a tarp? If so, then this is totally overpriced :("
3,A nice tarp,It wasn't as heavy gauge as I expected but other than that it works fine. Guessing that we'll only get a couple seasons out of it. Our original tarp was much thicker and lasted years.
2,Faded and tore in less than six months!,"The original tarp that came with our (other brand) playset lasted for 6 years and finally gave out this past summer. I ordered this tarp as a replacement, and it has already torn and faded badly... would not recommend..."
3,Ruth & Esther Commentary,Weiserbe is wordy and some of his interpretations are controversial. I didn't agree with everything but some of the historical and cultural information was valuable.
4,Oldie but a Goodie,"I read this book many, many years ago. Probably around the time it first came out. I recentley re-read it mainly because I thought I remembered a fact that was brought up in the book and wanted to see if I remembered correctly.When I first read it, years ago, I did not particularly care for it. However, I really enjoyed it this time . Just goes to show that your taste can change over time, I guess. It is not a long book and it moves pretty fast, and is quite interesting. Although, I did keep wondering why none of these people ever whipped out their cell phones when things went bad. Then I realized that when this book was written, everybody and their baby did not have cell phones like they do now. Having said that, I still felt that the story was great, and except for the absense of cells phones, the story felt very current."
4,My daughter loves it,My five year old wanted drums for christmas so my dad got her this. she loves it and so do we. it has volume control and you can use head phones with it. It has good sound and so far isnt driving me nuts. she hasn't had any of the problems other people described with thiers.
4,Nice bag. Lots of room but not perfect...,Seems to be well made. I love being able to put both camera and computer in the same bag. The front pocket on this bag could use some better interior pockets or separators.
3,its a good starter gun but not so great get a tippmann if u can,"i bought this gun for my sister and i got a tippmann 98 custom.This is a good gun for the price but the mask,hopper and pods are realy bad.my cuz was using this gun and when i shot him in the hopper and it broke and scrood-up 175 paintballs because the hopper broke and broke the other paintballs. the mask is a pice of junk and you can barely use it is not shaped right. the guns accuricy ain't so great but it might have been the paintballs (monster balls) they split like crazy and curve alot. the squeegy is realy nice and does a great job. I would recomend buying this gun if you are a starter at paintball but otherwise invest in a better gun and mask,hoper and pods(that will break if you shoot them)."
4,Great Starter Gun,"I have had this gun for about a month now. If you want to get into paintball, then this is the kit for you. It is great if you want to play with your freinds but if you plan to get more serious then I would get a better gun.It says you can upgrade the barrel but you can't. It doesn't come with a Co2 tank but for this price, they would lose money! You also get a Anti-Fog mask too.Pros:Low CostFunctions WellCons:No upgraded barrelPlasic Gun (compared to metal)Overall, good if you are just getting into paintball."
4,"Good gun, dont really need the other stuff tho","This gun that comes with the kit is good value...fairly accurate, good rate of fire, nothing above ordinary really. It is kinda sad that you cant change barrels, but there really isnt a big need to. The game flag and the paintball canisters have come in handy in a few Capture-the flag-games, but the mask is crap. Sure it is anti-fog, but the material is really cheap, and it takes a while to break it in and get it adjusted and back in shape.I would recommend this for people just starting off with paintball (dont forget to buy CO2!)"
4,Brass Eagle Striker,This is a great gun. Its my first and I love it. I recomend the Striker for begginers. I've heard its not the greatest for tournaments though.
4,Fun at a great price,"These are fun to use and works like a more expensive gun without the high price. Caution to people who have not used these guns before though: the balls can hurt and also be very careful to pull the lever on top otherwise all the CO2 will run out for the next time you want to play, or you can buy a refillable cartridge. We have all had a fun time playing and the accessories that come with this gun are essential to have to be safe."
1,This book is obsolete.,"This book was published in 1980, and apparently back then the TEA Exam was different from its current format. The book contains questions of a nature that are no longer found on the exam."
5,very good value for what it's worth,"i bought for a new born in the family. It arrived quickly after i order, and we were really happy with this product."
4,All the basics for a good price,Bought this to add to a baby shower gift and picked it up at a great price. Can't go wrong with Johnson's!
2,Not good value for money,I bought this as a baby shower gift. It doesn't look very presentable and I could have saved a lot of money if I would have bought each item separately. It looks cheap when you get it.
4,a good starter kit,This is a good starter kit for any new baby. But don't use the baby powder on you baby! I didn't use the baby oil either. It may be cheaper to just buy the other products on their own.
2,Product not as described. Buyer Beware!,"I just received this product. It did not come with the duck in Amazon's photo or any other photo I've found for this product on other sites. I contacted Johnson & Johnson today. They advised me that the product first came with a yellow duck, then it was changed to a blue hippo. The hippo was removed as of Dec 2009. Just know the product Amazon is selling comes without the toy. The rest of the product is as pictured minus the cute yellow bow."
5,Review for Johnson's Bathtime Essentials Gift Set,I purchased this along with a couple of other items as shower gifts for someone and shed loved it. It is most of the essential bath items needed to wash and keep the baby clean. Comes in the cute little gift bundle and is easy to keep up with since everything fits in the basket. She said it is just as cute in person as it is in the pictures.;)
2,I got cheated!,"I got this as gift from baby registry. Firstly, I received this gift in two weeks! And when I got the package finally, I found no hippopotamus bath toy at all as their product image illustrated or a duck other guys mentioned. I added it to the registry because it has every essential items plus a lovely toy. But I felt disappointed and cheated. They explained that it was delivered from manufactory directly.. But this is not the reason. I will never order anything from this seller since I got cheated!!!"
5,Perfect baby shower gift,"Way cheaper than in stores, pretty good size bottles, and in a cute case. I got this for my sister in law and she LOVED it. Really glad I took a chance and bought it because it worked out for me =]"
5,"Wonderful. wonderful, wonderful","Being an RN I am aware that many, many studies show-and the American Academy of Pediatrics has stated- that TALC baby powder should never be used with children. By using a TALC powder a child can develop asthma, bronchitis and other respiratory tract issues. Johnson & Johnson still does sell TALC powder-along with other companies- but they have been smart!! Johnson & Johnson has finally put the cornstarch powder-which is recommended by the above resources and is safe to use- in their gift set! Way to go! Not only are they helping us-as parents- they are protecting our children and that is what this company stands for. This is a wonderful and safe set to have. I love the scents!"
4,Would have shocked Judy Garland,"Told through computer-altered photography in a computer-generated world, ""Dorothy"" blends the look of reality and fantasy so clearly, it's hard to tell where one ends and the other begins. Dorothy (modeled by Catie Fisher) lives in a gray environment, with little besides her green eyes, red lips, jewelry and hair dye to set her apart from the surrounding drabness. Oz, of course, is bursting with color, but there's a great deal of danger, too -- making itself known first through the attack of a vicious flying monkey. But this Dorothy is no shrinking violet, and her grim matter-of-factness seems to get her through tough situations more easily than a ""golly gee"" attitude would do.Creator Mark Masterson has taken Dorothy someplace new. It's not over the rainbow, for sure, but I'm very curious to see where this path leads.by Tom Knapp, Rambles.NET editor"
5,A bold step in a new direction.,This is a great book. The combination of artwork and photography is beautifully done. This modern retelling of Frank L. Baum's creation is an entertaining if not dark departure from the MGM version we all are used to seeing. I also recommend visiting the website: [...] where you'll find great information and a chance to interact with the people behind the scenes.
5,Timely and Wonderful,"This is a timely and wonderful reference work. For those interested in uncovering information about seventeenth-century New England ancestors, this is an excellent resource guide. As many family researchers know, court records for the 1600s are one of three important sources of genealogical information, the others being vital records(town and church)and wills. The early settlers were litigious, being able to file their complaints easily and cheaply in the courts, without lawyers. Hence, there is a wealth of family information in these court files -- often highly amusing."
5,WHEE,"This crazy good album is also out of print. A very unfortunate state of affairs. It might be this band's best, although each of their albums is pretty close."
1,"Ah, but they don't know what they're doing...","...and I've seen them live before proving it in front of a roomful of completely annoyed people. Might work on a dadaist level, but my eardrums seem much happier with this being played someplace very very far away, as in ""out of earshot."" Really awful. Really."
3,It'ts a fair book,Not totally what Iexpected. There are more newer basket photographed than vintage baskets. Lots of contemperary weavers.
4,"This cd brings alot together TUPAC is wild,and a classic","I love this album,the new tracks add to his greatness. Changes,troublesome,& GOD bless the dead.Tupac's entire work comes out in changes,not only black to white or viseversa but,human to human .It features tracks from 2-pacalypse now which show his love and frustration and the choice of keep your head up as the frist track represents his respect.Troublesome directs his anger and fear to the streets.GOD bless the dead is the pain of loss and respect of life.All are backed by steel masters.We need more tracks from thug life,his top album.I love how Tupac uses his fame to educate,though hit'em up is crap.All and all this album reps his well ah,love ya Pac."
5,The greatest rapper there is!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Tupac was the greatest rapper there ever was and is. His music is a reflection of his personality and his live. I love this album and the others because it don't just relates to thugging it but living it. He talks about live, death, and love.It's to bad that we have to live off the left overs of his career instead of having him in the studios making new hits,but since were unable to do that, his left overs will always have a place in my c.d player. While Tupac hisself will always have a place in my heart and his goergous face will always have a place on my walls.Along with his further albums and past albums, THIS ALBUM IS HOT!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,One of the best rap albums.,I love Tupac's music and his lyrics. I think that his life story is amazing. I am so glad his legend continues.
1,this cd is sucks.....,"so do all of rap for that matter,it should'nt even be considered a real musical genre,it's just for no talent bums who can't perform real music."
1,RAP is CRAP......,"PERIOD......TUPAC was ""Okay"" but I didn't know him back when he was killed, so I really don't know anything about him. I do know that rap sucks and that everyone in Rap song making use way too many curse words and say ""nigga"" WAY TOO MANY TIMES......Nothing really special anyway.....But I have a rap of my own, see if you like it.....All you fools come in here each with a fake smileYou all think you can freestyle just cause you've seen the movie 8-Mile?This is old school rapping, with the king of crunk,you all are gonna jack-off in class, and you're gonna flunk,Your heads are all up on the air, but you'll come around,this era of ""Music"" is gonna be like your love life, your a** is gonna go down,Let me give you a reality slap my friends, you don't know,rap is crap, and now I have to go......I know it's not up on Tupac's level, but seriously, go F*CK Yourselves.PS, the Black Eyed Peas SUCK!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Tthe songs picked for that album,"i didn't like most oof the tracks cause there not that interesting, but the track Dre produced were good even though most the rapper on this album out shined the artist himself."
1,does it ever change,"This cd, like so many of 2Pac's other cd's, really disappoints me... In my opinion there is no original work anywhere on the album. It takes a large amount of dedication and work to produce an album of completely original music, which is something 2Pac didn't seem to want to do. I am a really open minded person, so to find true originality one might listen to soulfly, who actually bases there music on feelings and devotion. All in all, if you wish to purchase this cd, I'll tell you that if you've heard one, you've heard them all."
1,"greatest hit's, I think not",this album consist of washed of track that really don't make the charts or even the block and I really couldn't listen to the whole cd cause it's wasn't that very entertaining but a better cd is called Chronic 2001 and Jay-Z -The dynasty which a very good album and you should check it out.R.i.P. Eazy E
1,not a great album but what can you do but not buy it,"I bought this album and I just can't understand why they released such a bad collection of songs that are out there with no true lean. I am dissapointed that I bought this album, Snoop Dogg's new album is much better."
5,The best Hip Hop album ever,If you don't have this album then something's wrong with you. 2Pac is the greatest rapper of all time without a doubt. Every song on both cds is dope. From party songs with blazing beats like How do U Want It and I Get Around to soul searching and socially conscious songs like Changes and Keep Your Head Up. There's something here for everyone on this album. RIP 2Pac and all of Hip Hop's other fallen soldiers.
5,The greatest Rapper EVER!,"A couple years ago, a friend of mine was singing ""California Love."" I asked him what he was singing and he went ballistic. He told me 2pac was the greatest rapper ever and I needed to start listening to his music.Later, I asked my mom to ride me to the cd store. I walked in, bought ""Greatest Hits"" by 2Pac and went home and listened to it. By just listening to Changes and California Love I was immediately blown away and lstend to more tracks.Shortly after, I believed 2Pac was the greatest Rapper ever, and anyone who disagrees, is not a true rap fan.You MUST buy greatest hits!!! It is absoulutely amazing and it is the best. 2Pac is the greatest."
4,A Strong Compilation,"A nice compilation. I'm not a huge rap fan, but 2Pac made some incredible music, and a lot of it can be found on this set."
5,2pac is the G.O.A.T.,This album is the best album I personally own. I knew the second I bought this album that it would be sweet. I love every track on here. It's a must have for sure. If you don't got it yet then you need to get out and cop it. I guarantee he will not let you down with his music.
5,TIMELESS MUSIC FOR EVERYBODY,"The only sad thing about this album is all the commercial songs that contains. I mean, where is songs like ""If I die 2nite"", ""Holler if ya hear me"", Lord knows & ""Tradin war stories"". These among other more raw songs should be on 2pac's greatest hits. I'm not saying I dislike the album, all songs except ""Changes"" & ""California Love"" are great. 2pac made music for everybody. It's sad that many people just categorize every rapartist in the category where all they talkin about is money, gangbangin, guns etc. No matter who you are and where you live, Tupac can touch everyone with his according to me best lyrics ever written. Almoust three years has gone by since the tragic day, 13th of september, and still no one has been close to be compared with Tupac. Sorry DMX."
5,"In my opinion, this is 'Greatest hit minus one'.","This set is most definitely at the top of ANY list. It would be OVER the top if 'Only God Can Judge Me' were included. Those lyrics, I can't say enough about them. All those that are familiar with the cut know what I'm talking about when I say that few, precious few, can match them. RIP Pac, I wish you were still here."
5,5 stars,"I reviewed the album,as a matter of fact I'm listening to it right now and like any other time i listen to any of his sh*t he puts me in the ZONE and baby IT'S ON."
5,My Theory about Tupac,"The Cd Tupacs greatest hits was one of the best Cds ever because he used all me favorite songs. The best song on the Cd is Dear Mama because all of the words are very true about his life. If you ever seen the movie Thug Immortal it would explain everything. I also see it this way, if Tupac was dead than he would of never had made another tape. I think the whole thing about him and Biggie Smalls beefing was all an act, because in one of his songs on his new Cd he talks about how they will always be boys. What I'm trying to get at is that Tupac is not dead. I hope he will come back to the rappong industry. Thats it...."
5,Essential Pac',"2Pac is one of the greatest rappers of all time. He showed great ability and talent to bring the harsh ghetto life-style straight from the street to the speaker. His vivid story telling and complex characters are all brought to life in lyrics and rhythms. This album is a great cd to start out with. It was the first Pac album that I ever bought and it shows all of Pac's sided. It shows his rough and rougedness, ""Troublesome, Hit Em Up"", and his soft and sentimental side ""Keep Ya Head Up, Dear Mamma"". If you've never listened or owned a Pac album this is a great album to start off with. He shows off his great, vivid story telling on tracks like ""Brenda's Got A Baby"" and ""Trapped. Every song is great. You can pop it in and listen to it without skipping any tracks. Don't bother with buying his new album. Buy this one. You won't be disapointed."
4,The dream 2Pac album - possibly the only one worth buying.,"1998's Greatest Hits is the dream 2Pac album - possible the only one worth buying. All sides of 2Pac's music are displayed here - such tracks as 2 Of Amerikaz Most Wanted, California Love and Picture Me Rollin' are perfect for crusing in the Los Angeles sunshine in a black Mercedes - working with Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre and Syke respectively. Life Goes On from 1995's All Eyez On Me album is sensitive poetry about ghetto life, ditto previously unreleased tracks Unconditional Love and Changes. Pac's trademark gangsta violence rap is unleashed in the rare Hit Em Up, performed with the Outlawz. It's a fitting tribute to one of gangsta rap's biggest ever figures. It is mind-blowing to think that 2Pac has sold more albums while dead than while alive; but maybe this double LP makes that statement a bit more understandable."
5,This Definatly Has 2Pac's Greatest Hits,"All of the songs focus on what 2Pac believed in. This album deserves ********* 10 stars!!! You see, it has songs bout him cussing out the East Coast, about sex, about his life, and about the politicians and media in which he cusses out too. Its got everything, and as a Pac fan I love all his Cds and songs, and this definatly deserves more than 5 stars, but thats all you can give it. R.I.P. 2pac!!!!"
5,R.I.P.,"I used to hate 2pac. I still bought this album because I had nothing to buy and I was told this was good. After I heard Changes and the rest of the album, I fell in love with 2pac. If you want to get a 2pac album this is the one to get because it has all the greatest hits of 2pac, such as California Love, Changes, and 2 Of Amerikaz Most Wanted. It is a 2 cd set, which makes it twice as many hits as if 2pac had put out a one album greatest hits cd. All the songs are classics, and 2pac is now one of my favorite rappers. Why do some of the greatest rappers such as Eazy E, Notorious BIG, 2pac, and more have to die. 2pac is now one of my favorite rappers. Peace out and buy this cd because it is the greatest hits album to get."
5,A must in a rap collection,"This is definetely a ""must"" in a rap collection. I think Tupac Shakur focuses on things that really happen in his life, and then he raps about them. That's why he's so good at what he does. Greatest Hits is a very outdrawn cd spread out in songs from HARD CORE gangsta rap to softer choices (Dear Mama, Changes, Life goes on, etc.) I think this is a very well described cd of 2Pac's life and songs. It practically tells his whole life...It's definetely a MUST. Other rap cd's I reccomend: Life After Death --Notorious B.I.G.; All Eyes On Me --2Pac; Kiluminati: 7 Day Theory --Makaveli (a.k.a. 2Pac in a different form) Doggystyle --Snoop Doggy Dogg; 2001 --Dr.Dre; Ghetto D --Master P; The Predator --Ice Cube; Death Certificate --Ice Cube; Lethal Injection --Ice Cube; Bulworth Soundtrack; Friday Soundtrack"
5,the king,Tupac is a spirit of rap.I have no words to classficate him because he's great person for me and is my inspiraction for life.(to live & die in L.A.)is gift of god and (changes) to R.I.P. MAKAVELI and remember this words:KEEP THE FAITH IN ME I WILL NOT LET YOU DOWN. LOVE SALLINES
5,Greatest Hits... That's What It Is,"This cd is very good. It contains many of Tupac's hits, although I wouldn't say all, it's missing a lot of good songs, which I think should definitely be on here such as: Only God Can Judge Me, Blasphemy, Krazy, If My Homie Calls, etc. It's a great cd, I enjoy listening to it very much. It's really good especially for people who are just getting into Tupac, or for those who can't afford to get all his cds. Anyways, if you don't already have it, go get it, it's worth tha money.~R.I.P. Tupac Amaru Shakur 1971-1996~--Tupac's #1 Fan"
5,the dopest rapper that ever lived,"2pac was the best rapper that ever lived,and still is no one else could ever compare.This cd has all of his greatest hits if your only going to get 1 of his cd's let it be this one cause you have from way back in the day to today....."
1,A greatest hits album from a weak rapper,"2pac was (is) the most overrated rapper in the history of hip hop. Mobb Deep and Nas already destroyed Pac on the mic and Pac came back with some weak and generic disses that only illustrated that he was simply a horrible rapper with about as much raw talent as a common wood beatle. Pac fans are all riders who blindly worship him even though in their hearts they know he was simply terrible on the mic. The reason Pac sold so many records is because suburbia, brainwashed by the media, bought his albums because they wanted to be trendy and appear cool. If you want to hear some real hip-hop, cop a Nas, Wu Tang, Canibus or Rakim album!"
1,DIE ALREADY,"Dang is this dude ever going to die, I mean seriously the dude's been away for like 10 years now and been coming out with about 2 cd's a years. WTF!? You don't see notorious BIG bein a greedy mother do you?"
1,Rap is for ignorant high school drop outs with no talent,"How easy is it to rap?How easy is it to compose lyrics such as ""i like to smoke weed""anyone who listens to this crap is enducated and stupid.The day music died was when MTV started airing this junk.The world is still a better place knowing talented genres such as rock and metal exist."
4,Nearly Great,"Although I love 2Pac, this CD misses many great tracks (ie, All Eyez On Me). However it does have quite a bit on it that every fan should have."
1,EDITED DONT BUY!!!,"This is a censored copy of the albums, DONT BUY IT YOU CANT RETURN IT!!The item has been edited from the original studio version, it's horrible, it's like a radio edit... very bad"
4,Really Enjoy The Album,The 2Pac's Greatest Hits Album is awesome! For the price of $8 used it is a good buy. I bought mine in like new condition and the discs came perfect. The only problem I have with it is the disc holder doesn't hold the discs well and the back cover had some sticky crap on it....but that really doesn't matter. Great price and album! Plus it came fast
5,Best Rapper Ever !!!!,"Even though this isn't an actual 2Pac album, this is a classic cd worth buying full of the best songs ever. So, if they're anyone hating on him and hip hop can suck a DICK!!!!"
5,a true rap icon!,gotta love tupac. he was one of raps legends. all his songs bopped and this cd showcases his best works. a lot of these new rappers need to learn what being real means. they go around claimin to be gangsta but they run at the first sign of trouble.
5,kill's hot review,"Tupacs greatest hits is definatily his best cd obviously because it has all his greatest songs on it when I got this cd I thought it was gonna be good but it was great. It also has great artists featured on the cd including Danny boy,Nate Dogg,Dr.Dre,and Digital Underground definatily by this CD."
5,r.i.p.,"2 Pac is known as the deserving king of gangsta rap. His style and lyrics amazed everyone and inspired many other rappers to take the stage. This cd has most of his best tracks(Keep Ya Head Up, Hail Mary, Me Against The World, Life Goes On, Hit Em Up, Changes, California Love, Troublesom 96, All About You, To live And Die In LA, and Heartz of Men.)Thos tracks all kick ... and are classics. Cop this cd now!"
5,Greatest Ever,"First off 2Pac is the greatest rapper ever in my opinion. Secondly, this is the best cd he has ever made. It has classics from all of his cds and some of the most memorable rap singles ever produced. Out of the west 2Pac is great. IN OTHER WORDS THIS JOINT IS OFF THE HOOK! BUY IT!"
3,tupac is kewl,I think tupac's C.D. is the best C.D. iv'e ever heard. But he could leave some swear words out.
1,Overrated Artist,"Please avoid this album and any 2pac album. I used to think 2pac was a great rapper because I was blinded by his ""Thugish"" attitude which I thought was very cool when I was young and dumb. As I grown up, I learned the real deal. I sat down to listen to some of his records, then I was shocked at how wack his music is. Please avoid."
5,"I think Tupac is the greatest, I love all of his songs.","I really don't think that Tupac is dead, If he is I pray that his soul may rest in peace. I really love all of Tupacs music. I wish that I would've met him. But life goes on!"
4,2pac-Greatest Hits Edited,"Bought this version for my pre-teen. Although mostly edited, a few words were left on by mistake. Consider this when purchasing."
5,My reveiw,Right to the point as always this cd is 2pac more mainstream work the tracks are a right mix wit classic songs Like So Many Tears and Dear Mamma I think the cd should of been 3cds song Like Can u Get away ( Me Against the world) Under Pressure (ThugLife vol1) is missing but u can get them cds so if u want to get into 2pac and ur not a hardcore fan pick this cd up and like me u will become one
5,I WOULD GIVE IT MORE STARS IF I COULD!!,"GOD DAMN!!! U GOTTA BE KIDDIN ME!! THIS IS A GREAT COMPILATION OF THE BEST RAPPER THERE EVER IS, THAT'S RIGHT, IS!!! WAS, OR EVER WILL BE. LISTEN TO RAP..I LUV HIP-HOP AND AM A DIE-HARD RAP FAN..IF U WERE TO GET ONE CD EVER, GET THIS CD...NO B.SIN! NOT JUST RAP, FOR ANY GENRE, THIS IS THE BEST CD EVER, PERIOD... DEAR MAMA, UNCONDITIONAL LOVE, THESE SONGS ARE FROM THE HEART. I COULD GO ON NAMING ALL THE SONGS ON THIS ALBUM AND HAVE GREAT THINGS TO SAY ABOUT IT...BRENDA'S GOTTA BABY, SONG ABOUT THE STRUGGLES OF A PREGNANT TEEN...IF UR TOO BORED OR HEARTLESS TO LISTEN TO THESE SONGS!, HE KILLS IT WITH 2 OF AMERIKA'S MOST WANTED AND TROUBLESOME 96, FOR THE LADIES AND THE CLUBS; HOW DO U WANT IT, I GET AROUND, AND CALIFORNIA LOVE ...I DONT CARE WHAT ANYONE SAYS, TUPAC IS THE BEST RAPPER PERIOD...NO DISRESPECT TO BIGGIE OR JAY-Z, BUT THERE WILL NEVER BE AN ARTIST TO COVER SO MANY REAL/DEEP TOPICS IN HIS SONGS...GO COP IT, LISTEN TO IT, LOVE IT!!!"
2,2pac is so overrated.....,"dude, anyone that says 2pac is the greatest rapper to ever live is an idiot....im sorry, hes not that great. he didnt stand for anything...o yea, some of u r gonna say he stood for ""thug life"" but who wants to stand for that....especially when most of ur listeners are rich white boys? if u want to hear some rappers with an actual message in their lyrics listen to brother ali, any living legends, atmosphere, hieroglyphics, or gang starr....or hell challenge urselves with aesop rock or sage francis or el-p...dont buy this trash"
2,Disappointed,"This is a two CD item and the first CD will not play. I have nothing but problems with it. The second disc plays just fine, but being the first one has most of the songs I like the most this does not make me happy. Expected a cd I could listen to and enjoy. Very disappointed. Not in the music but the quality of the product."
1,"Come one, Think about it for One second","What's up with all the hype about this Overrated rapper? He had some decent songs but his albums are horible and unoriginal. Buy something from Nas, B.I.G and A Tribe Called Quest."
4,Could've been better!,"This is a cd you'll want to add to your 2pac collection.It could've done with some changes.Like instead of ""How Long Will They Mourn Me?"" they should've added ""Str8 Ballin'"" or ""Bury Me A G."" And Instead of ""Toss It Up"" the track ""Hold Ya Head"" should've been added.But other than that this cd is a great one. Some of the better songs are:Me Against The World,Heartz Of Men,Troublesome '96,To Live & Die In L.A.,and I Get Around.The tracks you'll want to avoid will be Hit Em Up and Changes cause they're both way played out.And also ""Life Goes On"" and ""Trapped"" cause after listening to those a few times,you won't be able to stand them.They are both very good songs,but will get old after a while."
4,The 2nd CD is better than the first one!,The CD is good and the songs are good but I defintly like more songs on the second CD! I like changes and all about you! I wish Do For Love was on ther though!I don't regret buying it!
5,This c.d. rocks!!!,"I love this c.d. so much. I listen to it every day, before bed, when I get dress and when I have time. I really recomend this C.D. to all of you who likes rap/hip hop."
5,"YEAH,I LOVE ALL OF 2 PACS SONG ATSPECIALLY I AINT MAD AT YA.","I LOVE ALL OF TU PACS ALBUMS AND ATSPECAILLY THE GREATEST HITS AND I LOVE THE SONG I AINT MAD AT YA AND BRENDAS GOTTA BABY.TU PAC IS THE GREATEST RAPPER THAT EVER LIVE.DAMN IT SO SAD THAT HE DIED I CRYED WHEN HE DIED TU PAC WAS MY IDOL AND DAMN DO HE LOOK GOOD. ALRIGHT PEACE OUT, SAMANTHA"
3,Decent... could've used more material,"I spent a lot of years hating Tupac because of his image and frenzied followers, but that's really no reason to hate an artist. Yeah, I bashed the hell out of him in the past but in truthfulness, he wasn't all bad. The reason I only gave this double-CD three stars was because a) there isn't enough material on the discs and b) there are a lot of good songs that were left off. If it were just a regular compilation, it probably could've gotten more, but since they're billing it as his Greatest Hits, there are a buttload of other songs that should've been on it.I wish to hell today's rap would be a little more like this. I didn't really respect the guy's lifestyle, but at least his music had a point, and it wasn't just meaningless babble like the MTV rappers. He had the ability to tell stories with his music, and while I wouldn't quite call it poetry, it was worlds more meaningful than the slop that BET and MTV throw at us."
5,PRETTY GOOD COMPILATION OF HITS FROM TUPAC,"This double disc complitaion of Tupac is essential in every rap fan's collection. Of course you are gonna get all of the big hits that everyone has heard and a few that you haven't that are sure to not dissapoint. However I think that this collection,though it is very good,lacks a few Tupac songs. My question is where are some of the great tracks from ""All Eyez On Me"" like ""Ambitions As A Rider"",""Tradin War Stories"",""U Cant C Me"",and of course ""California Love (RMX)""? Also,""Do For Love"" and ""Until The End Of Time"",though they were released later would have been great in this collection. It may be missing some other great songs,but this is a very good collection of Tupac material and is essential to any fan of rap music or just music period."
3,Good but not the Greatest hits..(telling it how it is),"As everyone knows, Tupac was the greatest rapper of all times..The songs on this cd are good but not all of them. For example the good tracks are when he joined Death Row records and the unreleased tracks like God Bless The Dead and Changes. So I would say buy the cd as it is well worth it. If i had the chance to put his greatest hits together I would have chose some of the better tracks from Makaveli album and All Eyez on Me. Like, Me and My Girlfriend, Bombfirst, Krazy, When we Ride, All Eyez on Me, etc...some of his unreleased tracks are brilliant so watch out for them..My Letter to the President is based on true life..and the Outlawz need a record deal as soon as possible...So forget Puff and BIG, Mase and jay Z, Lil' Kim and Nas, etc..If you listen to 2Pac you will know all his tracks are not made up...He has been through all the hard shit and died young...RIP 2Pac and can't wait for the Outlawz to release their album soon.."
5,VERY VERY GOOD,This Cd is great 1 of the best on my list I loved it and if u have some money GO GET IT! on some cd's that have 2 in the package and u only listen to 1 of them well on this one you'll be listing to both all the time u can't get enough! I wasn't really into rap I just liked 2pac a little but now I love this rap and can't get enough I am a heavy metal fan and I still like it!GET IT TODAY!
3,NO DISRESPECT INTENDED,I must say ovrerall this album could have been alot better a good album but not a great album but it is still a decent album to listen to. for instance hit them up for example should of been left off the album it felt out of place especially because of how he died. there are alot of other great tupac songs that should of been have included on the album.
2,Music tends to sound the same,"I actually started writing a feature review for this one, but after the first few songs I ran out of things to say. The Bangkok Five pride themselves on their indie rock DIY work ethic, which is good in some regards, but short-changes them in the production aspects of this album. Although the songs are catchy and have some killer hooks here and there (""Who's Gonna Take Us Alive"" and ""Giana""), the music tends to sound the same and gets a little boring at times."
3,Not the time for hybrids... (2007),"Don't expect a HD movie out of it, it's just bigger. Consider this before buying a handicam, forget about tape forever, but PLEASE buy the light accessory, it is absolutely necessary because of it's bad performance in poor light."
4,"Not great for stills, but nice video","Ok, the video isn't really HD either, but is much better than even a high end point & shoot camera video. (eg. Canon SD850)The size of the thing and the ability to take it anywhere in your pocket is worth a lot. Especially for baby.The stills are soft, but make fine prints. My wife still made me buy a dedicated camera for stills..."
2,Not happy with system error,"I bought htis from Amazon, and have troubles in playing back the video clips. Almost evrytime, after a while, I do see ""System error"" on the screen, and then the firmware is hung. After a power-cycle, the last recorded clip is gone! Some issues with the basics...so I called Sanyo service, they said this is happening because I'm using a 4GB plain SD card. Acc to the support guy, max of 2GB of plain SD is supported , for more GB, a SDHC card is needed. I could not find this info on the manual or spec...so I'm not sure how true is this. If anyone of you know about this , please let me know.Video is okay for my need...still is too bad.Firmware is just about average..not too great. There is much scope of improvement to be more user friendly and more informative with lesser use of buttons.Battery did not perform as promised in the spec.Also, there are way too many components in the box for such a specialized product. I would expect those many in a robotics kit."
2,I wanted so much to like this camera,"As I watch the videos of my kids on my 50"" plasma, 32"" LCD and Mac, trying to convince myself that I like the quality, my wife walks by and says, ""Fuzzy."" I know most guys out there will know what I'm talking about - she just killed the deal. Regardless of the specs, the wives don't lie - the picture quality just doesn't cut it. It's unacceptably noisey in all but the brightest of light and is an incremental improvement over my 6 year old Sony DVR. The product design is cool, the price is good, the SD card recording idea is perfect, but the HD promise doesn't come close to paying off.If you're looking for sharp, crystal clear images - you're just not going to be happy with this camera unless the gathering of technology and low price are enough to cause you to settle."
3,Does not work well indoors,"Saying that this camcorder does not perform well in low-lights conditions, this is an understatement. This camera is simply not designed to work indoors, even with all lights turned on."
5,The best first album of the 70s crossovers,"do you really love music? can you visualize the momentum in culture by the music of that time? it's seminal to the rock and soul melting pot. we're not talking about electrifying the blues like the british groups. this isn't a group becoming a family, they're a family with an evolving identity enthusiastically obliterating the definitions of rock and soul. you could call it raw like the first three Prince albums [it's better], but there's no doubt that there's an equal love of music is there. the joy in life and truth is there. open your mind, hefe."
4,RIP OFF!,"this is actually not to good,yet it is a gazillion dollars.if you do not want to waste money please do not but this.but i hear orion has some great products!!!!!(i don't work for orion.)"
4,some rarer tunes done well,"From 1990 I believe has some unique stuff. Dont overpay if you dont have the basics like JGB major release from 1991 (gray cover), which is kinda like part one to this release."
2,I agree that this is pickin' over the leftovers...,"With all the JGB shows in circulation, THIS is the best they could come up with? It's a lame compilation with some great moments, but a lot of filler. Someone else mentioned that this is a case of people pickin' over Jerry's leftovers and, compared to something like ""Don't Let Go,"" which was phenomenal, I have to agree. Don't waste your money on this..."
2,Shining Star,"A complete and utter disappointment, should have never been released. Get ""Don't Let Go"" instead."
1,Pointless,"Geez, these people have just stopped trying. Was there any reason to release this stuff? From listening to it is difficult to come up with a compelling argument, but then again it seems that there are enough lemmings out there who will buy anything with Garcia's or the Dead's name on it that there is little motivation to put out a quality recording."
1,Enough Already,"Garcia died nearly five years ago, yet there are still those who will not let him rest in peace. This is yet another of the many attempts to exploit his death for commercial gain. Give it a rest people. Enough already."
3,Just not that good,Sorry but I just can't get into it even though I'm a big Jerry fan. I ordered it back when it was first released and listened to it a few times before putting it away. A year or so later I tried to get into it again - no luck. Most of the time I end up giving anything associated with Garcia 5 stars. Not this time. This is full of lack luster performances that never get off the ground. I really cannot even believe I'm giving it 3 stars. I just spot it 3 stars because you get to hear Jerry's guitar. And the cover art is almost insulting. It looks like some bad imitation of 60's art. I cannot believe Jerry would have been proud of this disaster. Buy something else from him.
2,What an injustice!!,"When I heard that Arista released a Garcia band collection of songs recorded live during Jerry's last years, I jumped at the chance to plop down the 25 bucks and purchase it. (Regardless of how horrible the cover art was.) I should have paid a little more attention to who the executive producer of this effort was!! I couldn't believe the lack of sound quality and extremely slow tempo of most of the songs. Although there were a few sweet moments in both of the cd's, I just can't recommend to buy this. I think someone else needs to release a ""later years"" collection! As a serious Jerry and Grateful Dead fan, I advise you to save your money, dust off those bootlegs and remember what it was really all about."
4,Pls. buy this wonderful cd!,"I've followed the Dead and Jerry since '68. I'm writing this review because I see that others have, well, trashed this cd. NO! This is Jerry again celestial. As the banner over the Avalon read in '68: They're not the best at what they do; nobody does what they do!. Still true and still true of the Jerry Garcia Band. BUY this cd. Wait till you hear how Jerry and the band take the Stones' Lets Spend the Night Together and make it into a so-sweet love ballad! Price of admission is worth it right there!"
3,great service by amazon but both versions sent to me had defect,"blown away by amazon's desire to provide good service but even after replacing system one speaker still has hissing noise.putting that aside, i have enjoyed using the system."
5,"Higher production values, and more songwriting focus","A great follow-up to They Only Come Out At Night, with more songwriting contribution by Dan Hartman, who later became a major production force in his own right. With Rick Derringer replacing Ronnie Montrose on guitar, this became the third definitive Edgar Winter lineup, in addition to the original Edgar Winter Group, and of course, the original White Trash. This is a must-have for any serious fan."
5,Shock Treatment being reissued,"Shock Treatment is being reissued as a two-for along with They Only Come Out At Night on February 20, 2007 in England. I hope Amazon will offer it for sale or pre-order by then. Hold on a few days and save yourself $50.00 or more. I love Edgar but those prices are just nuts."
4,My uncle loves this stuff - more expensive then store,my uncle loves this item. He keeps asking for more but you can actually get it in stores for $1.00 a bar.
4,Will be one of our favorites,"You have to take your time with this pop-up . There are so many items on each page to discover and enjoy. Would have given it a five but the pages do not pop-up smoothly at first. So, be careful as you open each page. You may have to assist in the full display of each page, but well worth the snags."
5,A good Way to enjoy the story with a Child,The creativity is awesome: complex paper engineering and beautiful art work. I mad me want to buy the rest of his books
4,A Plethora of Gardening Ideas,"The reader is offered a plethora of gardening ideas through attractive and plentiful photographs. Numerous garden types, garden designs, structural elements, and plant life are discussed in this book. However, by covering such an extensive variety of garden topics, the reader never gains an in depth appreciation of each particular garden style. This book will provide a complete overview to gardeners uncertain with which particular garden style they wish to pursue. Once the selection is made the reader would be better rewarded with purchasing a garden book dedicated to the chosen garden style."
4,review,"Book is ok. What it will do is give you some basic ideas for landscaping, but it won't go in depth in any specific area. Good for a beginner; that's it"
4,Not just for divorcees,"This is not just a book for people going through a divorce, it's also a good book for couples to read to help with their relationship. Chapter 10 is especially helpful for people who are still married."
2,Uneven,"There are great songs here, but you're better off hearing the live versions on Songs In The Attic, or any of his other live discs. The problem here is the sound quality (probably of the original recordings) is very poor. Clearly, you can tell that great things were ahead for the relative unknown singer-songwriter."
2,The worst of his studio albums,"This lacks the raw emotional punch of 'Cold Spring Harbor' and it's certainly not as good as the albums he wrote afterwards. The title track is on every compilation and the three other best songs here are on the must-own live album 'Songs in the Attic' in highly improved versions. This album is mostly obsolete. However, 'If I only had the Words' and 'Travelin Prayer' aren't bad. They are the only reasons to buy this album."
3,20.00 Dollars?,Twenty dollars for an old Billy Joel CD?..Poor Billy must be desperate to pay off all that alimony and those the detox bills..
5,Still love,I bought this album way back when it came out and it is still the masterpiece it was when I purchased it as a kid.
3,super talented musician and good songwriting,"I believe Billy Joel is a great musicianbut I think his songwriting is only good, notincredible.. he doesn't swing like Elton John...there's just something missing on this album..the songs are all a little too square.. butthe man is undoubtedly talented and this justmight not be my style of music.. I still recommendit for the average music fan"
3,His worst is still pretty good,It lacks the direct emotional and melodic appeal of 'Cold Spring Harbor' and it's not as good the albums he released after this but it's still not bad. Even Billy Joel's worst songs hold a level of craft that puts them across. A shame about the generic sounding production though.
2,Disapointing,"Mofi needs to sharpen up their act. Many of the latest releases sound a bit lifeless and do not sound better than the original remaster from Sony(and others). This mofi sounds a bit veiled compared to the Sony remaster. Why pay USD 30 then? Similar to mofi Stevie Ray Vaughan-Texas Flood, which is very very disapointing. On B. Joel-Turnstilles, mofi didn't even bother to print lyrics, and no info in general. Why? When record companys release remasters these gays, you get bonus cuts, extencive booklets, etc. Not so with mofi. What a shame and letdown for us consumers."
4,Pleasing Piano Indeed,"Whether its a touching ballad like You're My Home or a rollicking piece such as Travelin' Prayer, I really can appreciate the keyboard stylings of Billy Joel. In addition, each piece has some incredible arrangements and lyrics. The words just tell great stories. The Ballad of Billy The Kid is a perfect example of an old Western Tale. Other songs like Captain Jack deal nicely with the realities of growing up.Whereas I prefer Turnstiles more than Piano Man, I still seem to appreciate this recording as well as Streetlife Serendader and Cold Spring Harbor on a special level. Billy Joel styling's in the early days were not as rooted in Top 40 trends. Don't get me wrong, I like many of Billy Joel's more commercial releases too. However there seems to be a certain innocence in Billy's early recordings and this Piano Man record stands tall in that area."
1,Digital mistake,"I was thrilled when I saw that Piano Man was re-released on SACD. I could finally enjoy one of my favorite albums in Hi Rez with jet black backgrounds and explosive dynamic range.Wrong!!!!The album sounds like somebody threw a pillow over the microphone. The background isn't silent, it's muffled. The highs don't soar - like they should - they are dead and gone.My old 1998 Columbia version is clearly better for an audiophile. I had to check to make sure I didn't get the discs mixed up.This disc sounds just as bad through my Sennheiser HD800 headphones as my Bosendorfer speakers.On the other hand - the Animals Retrospective SACD album is a treasure if you're looking for a place to spend your money."
4,A couple of essential hits among many entertaining songs,"Billy JoelPiano ManThis album has the great title track and ""Captain Jack"". The rest of the songs are very good but fail to lift this up to classic status.This is a very good four-star album."
5,Billy's Best,"Billy Joel has made many great albums, but this one is possibly his best. ""Piano Man,"" ""Captain Jack,"" and ""The Ballad of Billy the Kid"" are some of the best songs ever written. The LP also has many fan favorites such as ""Somewhere along the Line,"" and ""You're My Home."" The album has a great flow to it from start to finish, and has some of the best piano playing I've ever heard. Everyone needs to have this album, simply because every song on it is good. In my opinion, this is the best album ever made."
4,nice but not great,"When I saw this album being released on sacd I had high hopes (like the stranger sacd 5.1). this transfer is the best of piano man by far but why isn't there a 5.1 version?? The stranger sounded so great in 5.1 and I wanted so much the same for piano man. In any event the 2ch sacd version does sound the best that you will get, as of this date, for this album."
3,Great for the RIGHT kid,"I agree that if I was a kid again, I would love this toy. For my 5-year-old son, however, who is an aircraft fanatic, we thought this would be ideal. But I think this toy's high concept is perhaps overwrought, frankly, maybe too concrete. A more abstract version would probably be more fun. It also falls apart a lot. The seats come off, the railings fall down, the computer won't stay on the desk, the ""safety shields"" come off, etc. My hubby and I sat down late Christmas eve to ""set out the new toys,"" and needless to say, had a late night of it assembling this (we had NO IDEA what was ahead of us,) but that part was fun (though I agree about the silly little flowers!) I do think over time, this will be a lot more fun. We have put it away for use later. Great for a child who loves intricate little details - not for a big mover."
4,Requires assembly!,"Be prepared to devote hours and hours to assemble this toy. My husband is still rolling his eyes at me, as in what were you thinking?! The final product is very good and our five year old is enjoying it. It also requires space to store because you certainly wont want to ""dis-assemble"" it for any reason."
2,dont waste your time or money,"I didnt even have enough patience to put this toy together.my husband and 11 year old sent many hours putting it together. my son who is 3 could have cared less about the thing,his cousin however managed to have it disassembled in a matter of minutes.The only reason I spent so much money on this toy(we evan bought the plane,baggage carrier,and taxi)was becase when researching toys I read good reviews about playmobil toys,but in my opinion dont bother,my son has much more fun with a bucket of legos."
5,Mick is the one and only HARDCORE LEGEND,after the sucess of the ric flair dvd the wwe have released a dvd dedicated to mick foley.This dvd is great becasue it showcases his career in some of his greatest matches.it truly is awsome.The only thing that could of been better was a third disc with matches from 2000 onwards.Such as wrestlemania 2000 and his im pact today.Overall bloody excellent dvd.Must have.
4,"Good DVD, Except for one Thing","This a good dvd that covers his WCW, ECW, SMW, and WWE days. The only problem that I see with the DVD is the Mick Foley matches from 1998-2000. Which is part of the WWF Attitude era. The WWF logo is smugged out on everything you can think of: Turnbuckles, banners, ring apprains, t-shirts etc... This is pretty annoying and I don't care how diehard of a fan you are because it is an eye sore. I have to tell like it is just like Jesse Ventura. If I was Vince, I would resolve the problem right away with the World Wildlife Foundation because if not fans are just going to buy WWE bootleg dvd's. Which will hurt the company's bottomline. I just don't see people paying $20 to $30 for this shotty production everytime. ""Monday Night Wars"" and Kurt Angle are the next future WWE DVD releases. I tell you people something, I'm sorry to say this but I'm not that excited it about it. I hope my review helps."
4,A diverse selection of matches and Foley doing intro,"This review is for the 2-disc version without the 'hardcore edition' label in front. First off I found this set to be a pleasant surprise. Instead of having the usual one hour biography segment, Mick Foley does a short in-studio intro before every match.I found Mick to be candid and pleasant. He gave some interesting anecdotes and it was nice to see his everyday persona(as opposed to his wrestling characters). On a couple of the ECW matches, he also does commentary with 'the Coach'.The matches included was diverse and gave a nice sampling of Foley's body of work(ECW,WCW,WWF). Also included are his promo spots/interviews over the years with his many different personas. I found out later that there was a newer 'Hardcore Edition' with his WWE matches(I've never seen these). I recommend this newer edition(with 3-disc)."
5,amazing dvd!!!,"double disques incroyable regroupant les combats mythiques de foley.les bonus sont superbes et esperons que cette édition incitera wwe à éditer d'autres grandes stars tel que Goldberg,Bret hart,Macho man,ultimate warrior,sting etc.a ne pas rater."
2,Cheaply made,"You would be better off purchasing something at the General Dollar Store. This canister is so overpriced, the lids just sit on the top, they do not snap and the individual canisters just sit on it, so if you accidently knock it, you will be busy picking everything up off the floor. Mine actually came with the plastic being broken on the inside lip. Very, very cheaply made. Definitely DO NOT recommend."
1,Like an overgrown term paper.,"This book is incredibly detailed and documented, but the useful information in it could be reasonably summarized in about ten pages. If you suffer from insomnia, this is a good buy, but if you want significant information, it's a waste of time."
5,Camelot Original broadway cast,I bought this CD because I always loved Camelot and especially Julie Andrews. It was a fabulous album. Robert Goulet was so great that I bought another CD of his greatest hits. This has to be one of the best broadway CD's I have ever bought. You will love it and I highly recommend it!
5,best musical version of Camelot,This is still the best version of Camelot that you can get without going to see a production. Too bad the movie doesn't have this soundtrack. Julie Andrews has such a beautiful voice.
3,"Not that ""brief shining moment"" yet","Unfortunately, in musical theatre, the original is not necessarily the best. This was not one of Richard Burton's better performances. In most of his songs, he sounds bored and drunk. His line delivery is so empty and passionless. Robert Goulet has a terrific voice but fails to bring anything more than a dull machismo to the role of Lancelot.Camelot is not a show that comes across well on a record. The songs are so vital to the arc of the story that, when listened to outside the context of the plot, can sound glib and hammy. I would strongly urge anyone new to this show to check out the DVD video of the Broadway revival starring the magnificent Richard Harris and Meg Bussert.Camelot: Broadway Version"
3,Nicely written for very young children,"Photo pictorial for children shows progress of a baby elephant from birth through adulthood. Nicely written for very young children and with excellent photos; about what you would expect from television's Discovery channel. The book is a companion volume to ""Africa's Elephant Kingdom""."
5,league of his own,"SRV shows his greatness here..nice video work and great overall DVD's for two and a half hrs of greatness, it is well worth your money. The best SRV DVD out there. In my opinion the second disc is better than the first, for a few reasons. One being Johnny Copeland and the other being Stevies energy. Not that it wasn't there in the first disc, but when they are both alternating(Copeland & Vaughan) it is quite amazing how they feed off eachother...even though people hate on the organ, you can't hate on Reese Wynans, he has some ability in his own right. either way a must have DVD!"
5,Man o Man is this guy good,"Mesmerizing. Can't believe how much sound comes from his guitar/band. This is a must have video. I can sit and watch this everyday. If you have never seen him play you must watch this. It would be a great gift for a guitar player. SRV was the greatest rock guitarist of all time. You can tell the guy is really into his performance/music. Interesting to see how the crowd reacts on one of the DVD's. They actually boo him!! He just keeps plucking away. This would be a great video to play for background pleasure during a party. I would bet that everybody would eventually be sitting there watching it, though."
4,"Great show, not so great quality","This is a fantastic Stevie Ray Vaughan show which shows the true guitar skills of Stevie Ray. Any true fan will need to own this show simply to hear his masterfuil guitar shredding. The sound quality isn't great, but at a normal level of sound, it's fine. The only problem is the bass is a little off when you turn it up."
5,SRV & Double Trouble,"Listening to SRV and watching him are two different things. I am intrigued by the amount of sound he can produce with one guitar and only two hands. Tommy Shannon and Chris Layton are the best. I enjoy hearing the French idiots in the background too.... they were ignorant in '82, and appreciative in '85."
4,"Real Good, But I've Heard Him Do Better","Don't get me wrong, I love this DVD, and I am a huge Stevie fan, but I've heard him play much, much better than that. Despite the tough crowd, they did play pretty dang good. However, the sound quality on the first performance kinda sucked. And on the second performance, on the last few songs, the camera work went way down hill, only one camera was working and it was way far away from the band. Overall, this DVD is pretty good, but there are some pretty noticeable flaws in it."
1,Horrible!!! Do NOT buy this video!!!,My husband bought this for himself as he is a die hard Stevie Ray Vaughn fan. It was immediately evident that this was trash. The voice(s) did not sync with the video. Gave us both a headache to try to watch. Will be returning immediately. Can't believe this is being sold at all.......Shame on you!
5,The Kind!,Great dvd. A must buy for any Stevie fan!I was lucky enough to see him live twice.These two performances brought back great memories.
5,Dragonsinger,"In Dragonsong we were first introduced to Menolly. But in Dragonsong we know her as the misunderstood girl at her father's sea hold. In Dragonsinger we come to know her as the happy girl at the Harper Hall, where all the best music is. Menolly is by far the best apprentice harper in Harper Hall, which may be her biggest trouble. When everyone but another apprentice named Piemur hates her for her ease at playing even the most difficult of songs jealousy begins to be a part of her daily life.In my opinion this is the very best of all the Pern books."
4,Another good YA book,"""Dragonsinger"" picks up pretty much immediately after the end of ""Dragonsong"", with Menolly's arrival at Harper Hall. This story covers her settling into the Hall and starting on the path to being a Harper.Over all I enjoyed the story told in this book. It was fun seeing Menolly meet all the different teachers at the Hall and otherwise adjust to life outside of the Seahold.The biggest problem that I had with this book is that the plot and characters are a bit simplistic. However, keeping in mind that this book was written for young adults and not for actual adults, I don't hold this against the book.Certainly a good book for lover's of Pern who want all the stories they can, and for young adults looking for something good to read."
5,This is a must read.,"I was introduced into Anne McCaffrey by my older sister (thanks a bunch Dana!) She told me about DRAGONSONG and suggested that I read it. I read it and instantly I was a Anne McCaffrey fan. I went on to read DRAGONSINGER and DRAGONDRUMS. But out of all three, DRAGONSINGER was the best. I've read the book over and over. A corner of the cover is torn off and the pages, well, you can tell this book has been read a lot. My only complaints:What about some of her old friends like Audiva, what happens to her? And the last complaint: Anne McCaffrey needs to write more about Menolly in later years. To all those people who think Anne McCaffrey's a bad writer-oh, never mind! I don't wanna even think about those people."
3,"Great book, but pales in comparison to the others","This book is, by itself, wonderful, but in comparison to the other Pern novels, I have to give it 3 stars. This trilogy, altho a nice compliment to the Dragonriders of Pern trilogy, isn't as well-written. If it weren't for the other books, I'd probably give it 4 or even 5 stars."
4,Pretty good...,"This is probably my favorite non-dragonrider novel of the series (my favorite period next to DFlight and Moreta) Never mind that the ""poor misunderstood Menolly"" schtick is getting old. Never mind that the idea of ANY apprentice rising to journeyman rank in a week (especially a female harper) is completely unfeasable. Never even mind those damnable firelizards that crop up en masse in every RPG or CON. Viva the occaisional piece of sugar-loaded, escapist, YA girly fantasy! and Viva the Dragonlady along with it!"
5,Good but read DRAGONSONG first.,I really liked this book but I think I would have liked it better if I had read some other books first. This was the first book of Anne McCaffrey I read and thought that she had only written a couple of books. Boy was I wrong! I found it in my school's library with only DRAGONSONG alongside it. But I saw that there was some other books besides them and I have been reading everyone that I could get my hands on. 6/28/99
5,Luv luv,Luv dis book so much!!! Makes me wana hav dragons soooo bad!!! Veri fun 2 read from start to end
5,"Once you read this one, you'll want to read the whole series",Achieves the perfect balance between fantasy and reality. Enchanting narrative. Details and descriptions are so well handled you can almost taste and smell. Will make a science fiction fan of anyone who reads it
1,The Last P.U.,"Very disappointing ""sequel"" to Ponicsan's wonderful ""The Last Detail."" Beginning with Buddusky's contrived resurrection, which effectively ruins the point (and my fond memories) of the earlier novel, this bore-fest quickly devolves into an unpalatable politicized gripe session. And, surprise surprise, the political stance is that ""War is bad"" -- and the moral: ""The establishment can't be trusted."" No bravery here. No reason ever to revisit this, either. I never threw a book away before, but I was more than happy to pitch this one."
4,Good starter set of Berliner Philharmoniker collection,"This is an excellent collection of previously released concert DVDs by Berliner Philharmoniker.The set includes;European Concert From IstanbulGala From Berlin - Invitation to the DanceEuropa Konzert From PalermoA Gershwin NightEuropa Konzert From Athens: Johannes Brahms: Piano Concerto No.1 & Piano Quartet No. 1/Daniel BarenIf you have not bought any of the above, this set will serve as a great starter of you collection."
2,Check it out from the library,"The story line had potential, and the characters were well-written and likeable. My main problem was the dialogue between the adults; it was so jerky and awkward. They supposedly flirt with innuendos and what-not, but I completely missed it. Were these lines deleted? I found myself often saying, ""huh?"" and having to re-read several scenes. Risa, the main female protagonist, had a best friend whose husband was unfaithful. Right away, after being ""broken-hearted,"" she jumps right into the sack with some other guy. And I mean right away, as in the next day. These characters had so much potential being that they sounded funny and likeable, but the writing didn't flow at all."
3,A Good Read For A Debut Effort!,Ms. Plum's debut effort was very enjoyable for the most part with very vivid characters with very real and honest problems. Risa and Ben are two people that need the other but don't see this right from the start. Their romance is slowly built and as a result the reader will find themselves truly invested with the characters. Secondary characters and storylines are also well done and bring something special to this story.Seldom do debut efforts speak to a reader. The process of finding a unique voice and way of telling a story comes with time. Ms. Plum is well on her way to becoming a worth while voice in the genre of romance. I recommend that you give this debut effort a chance.Official Reviewer for www.romancedesigns.com
2,Ughhhh,"Let me start by saying, the characters were believable and lovable. The story line was good and a little unbelievable. The part that irks me is the actual writing (and I don't know if I should blame this on myself, for only reading after a long day-with my mind not always into it, but.....); in one area Ben's having Molly straight out of college-that puts him at 26 (at best), but he started college at 16, so maybe he's only 20 now? In all other areas, it's implied that he's in his late 30s/early 40s, welllll which is it? In other parts, we just jumped into things, I kept asking myself ""how'd that happen?"" ""where did that come from?"". And I'd reread the last page to try and make it make sense, and sure enough-there is no explanation! Even with a good story line, only sheer determination got me to finish this book."
2,Not as good as I'd hoped...,I really thought I would like this book and I can't believe how bad it was. The writing was jumpy and all over the place. I really couldn't enjoy the characters very much. I kept having to go back and figure out how they got to where they were. Am I right in saying that the first half of the book took place in 2 days? I also couldn't figure out Ben's age and why Risa even liked him. He was grouchy and grumpy and mean at times. Sigh. Even the secondary characters were annoying. I doubt I will be buying any more books by this author which is too bad cause I really liked the premise of the book.
1,Very bad,It looks pretty and nice but it was defective .The lead does not come out and for the expensive price it has !!!!pay 20 dollars to buy a defective item .It makes you think are these online sellers trying to sell an item or trying to get rid of defective products!!!! it seems like no one checks on them .Very nice pencil but did not work even for a day .just a waste of money .WHen it arrived there was a lot of dust on the box that had not been removed before putting in the box also.
5,Just Buy This CD!,"There is no way your CD collection is even close to complete without this disc. Bill's CD is beyond anything else he has ever done. If what you like is back to the roots, old school, rock and roll then this is what you have been looking for. Take a small helping of blues, a pinch of southern rock, and a heavy dose of ripping guitar, (not to mention the fantastic vocals) and you have Wanderlust."
4,Great rock from Firehouse guitarist,Bill Leverty's guitar ability was never in question and now his vocal ability is proven also. This is some great rock music from one of the guitar greats of this era.
1,It does NOT work!,I received this bottle warmer as a gift. First of all it does not fit the bottles I have. I have the tommee tippee and they are too wide so it doesn't wrap around the whole bottle completely. and then it takes forever to heat up. I waited a good 15 minutes and the bottle was not even warm! It sucks!
4,Worth the money,"Works well, have to remember to push both the bottle size button and then the ON Button, will turn off when done. Have used with 5, 6 and 8 OZ bottles with no problems."
1,Did not work,"We purchesed this warmer because we take trips to see family that live hours away. From the other revies, this was the best warmer. We did not use it untill this weekend and to my disappointment it did not work."
1,Travel Warmer,"There is absolutely nothing redeeming I can say about this product, as it was a huge disappointment. My wife and I were out about over the holidays doing some shopping, and our daughter got hungry while we were on the road, we attempted to use this thing to heat 4 ounces of milk in a glass bottle, that had been in the diaper bag freezer pouch for at least an hour, and 20 minutes after my daughter screaming in absolutely agony from hunger pains, the bottle was lukewarm, while the warmer itself was impossible to hold because it was so hot. We tried using a plastic bottle the first time we tried it, and was also unsatisfied with the outcome, but thought that maybe because it was a plastic bottle, but the glass bottle did not fair any better."
5,Awesome product!!! LIFE SAVER***,"This works wonderfully and the safety feature w/ automatic shut off makes me rest easier. This is a must for anyone needing to heat a bottle while out or traveling. When we started formula feeding we realized all to quickly that many new stores and gas stations have automatic faucets that you are unable to control the temp of making it nearly impossible to heat a bottle while out. It makes you not want to go anywhere or becomes exhausting having to stop at 10 different places with two upset children before you can find somewhere that can accomidate. And, by that time your child is much to irrate and hungry that he/she is basically to upset to even realize the bottle is ready! This item warms bottle to perfect temp in approx 5 min and you can continue driving the entire time making life much much easier.A MUST HAVE FOR ANY PARENT!!!"
1,Doesn't work!,"I registered for this item and received it as a gift, why, I don't know. I never really even travel by car too often. I decided to try it out the one time I did travel, my son was 4 months old.. I plugged it in and waited and waited and waited and the item never ever heated up. It just remained cold. I tried to take it back to Babies R Us but the return time had already passed so they wouldn't take it back. My advice on this item is, don't buy it, even if it does work, you will probably never use it."
1,Doesn't Work!!,"I bought this bottle warmer because my son is on the ready to use formula, which has to be kept cold. It's hard to find a way to warm the bottle when you are on the go or running errands. I tried using it today & followed the directions. It DIDN'T work. I even tried pushing the 8 oz button & turning it on more then once. It still didn't warm the bottle.I wouldn't suggest buying this product."
5,"If the wife is happy, I am happy!","This was a gift for my wife, Rebecca. She has loved this book since a young child in elementary school and has read it to our two daughters. She is thrilled to get a copy rather than getting it on inter-library loan. It is in great shape, especially since it was previously in a library. Very little wear and tear. excellent gift. Thank you. The service was great-it arrived before Christmas!"
2,"Cool idea, but it doesn't work very well","I thought this kit would be nice because there is no installation and it's easily moved to another car if you want. Sadly, it just doesn't work very well. The mic is WAAAY too sensitve. It picks up every possible sound (traffic, road noise..etc). The kit worked well when the car was parked, but not well at all when actually driving. Poor sound quailty + unreliable performence = returned for a refund."
2,Parrot is a dead bird,"I had this device for a few months. The menu system is completely worthless and the instructions might as well have been written in some lost language. Next the car charger adapter fell apart in my cigarette lighter and took a tweezer to get the parts back out of the little hole. After reassembling the darn thing it worked for a few weeks and then just died. No light, no sound, nothing. I checked the power, the fuse and everything is fine. It just did not work. The Parrot website was equally worthless. I used the link to email for tech support but they never got back to me."
3,Nice idea; why can't somebody make a better version?,"The idea of a plug in, no charging required, no thingie in your ear handsfree device is great. The execution is only fair. I have had one of these for 3 or 4 years and it works reasonably well, better at low speeds with low ambient sound levels. Forget it with the sunroof open. It is entirely independent of the stereo system, which means no button pushing with incoming calls and the stereo need not be on. No FM transmitter nonsense. I still have to dial calls by hand. Most times I can have an acceptable, duplex conversation but sometimes I can't hear the caller or they can't hear me- seems to vary with their phone. Voice dialing doesn't work, largely because my Treo doesn't support voice dialing and the software app is poor. I can't understand why somebody doesn't make a better version of this concept."
1,"love the game, but dont buy the ones filled with water","in the package these balls are filled with water. For what reason I don't know... but the first time we used them one of the balls busted. So buy the game, just don't buy the ones with water."
5,Very Helpful,"This book was extremely effective and very informative. I even tried the Murad products that Dr.Murad talks about in the book and saw great results (I will be a loyal customer from now on). It was refreshing to read because one of the best parts about this book is that Dr.Murad isn't trying to sell his products to you. Rather, he explains clearly and effectively what your skin needs to be healthy. He also suggests products (other than Murad) that you can buy to get those important ingredients, herbs, vitamins, etc... that will keep your skin looking great and help with your overall health. No wonder Dr.Murad is so well respected in his field. He clearly wants to share his advances and innovation about skincare with the rest of us."
3,"Great Concept! Follow a Regimen, not the buzz",I read the book and began doing the program. I realized I had been following the buzz that comes up every so often instead of a regimen. The change is really great! I feel better about the way I look and my husband even noticed! It really makes sense when you read the book and really think about it.My esthetician recommended I consider Murad. I went and found the book at the bookstore and decided to take it home. The book is an easy read that make sense and really goes away from all the marketing jibberish and talks to skincare. I love it!
2,Not at all entertaining,"I was not at all entertained by this book. I have read several books on the French Foreign Legion and this one was probably the most boring; in fact, it was text-book-boring. I tried reading it and just could not endure it beyond the first 100 pages. It may have historical detail as mentioned in other reviews, but it is certainly very dry and has no exciting moments or narrative. Sort of like telling war stories while on elephant tranquilizers."
5,Great book,"Incredibly useful book, easy to use. Contains all the Excel information you will even need in a basic statistics class."
1,Not as promised,"The set arrives. When removed from the box, the case is dirty - it actually has dirt on it - the logo is already marred, and there are loose strings. This is a product purchased from Amazon, not an Amazon seller. Nevertheless, the case is wrapped in a protective cardboard ring. Once this is ripped open and the case is unzipped, the buyer is surprised to find that the balls - every single one of them - are marred in one way or another. Some have blemishes where the resin has been unevenly applied. Others have marks on the balls that might suggest this is a used set if the buyer had not already ripped open the protective cardboard ring. This user would return the set if the shipping were not prohibitively expensive. Save your money."
4,Interesting,"I'm not the big Egyptologist in the family (that's my hubby's place), but this show not only held my interest (never a given) but it also caused me to learn a few new things (always good at any age, even mine). It's not something I give frequent thought to, but when the subject comes up, as it did in this well-presented video, I'm extremely amazed at the extraordinary accomplishments of the ancient Egyptians. These folks engineered extremely complicated works thousands of years before my forebears in Europe had any clue on how to build long-lasting works (unless you count Stonehenge, which doesn't fare well in a comparison with the Great Pyramid, or most of the smaller pyramids, or other many Egyptian feats of engineering). As a novice-approaching-intermediate Egyptologist, I would recommend this video to same. (Experts may be underwhelmed -- I can't really speak from that perspective.)"
4,Great DVD Player,This is our first portable DVD player and we love it. The picture is crystal clear! It was a life saver on the plane with my daughter. The only thing I don't like is that the iPod or remote (whichever you have docked) is easy for a little one to touch. But being able to watch things off of the iPod is a great feature. And I am sure the remote will come in handy one day.
4,Good player,This is a good unit. The one I had before this was a tablet style and I hated it. It had to lean back on a leg in order to be stable. If you tried to have it sitting at 90 degrees it would tip over eventually. After a few times of that happening it died. I like this unit.
5,Definitely Worth A Purchase!,I bought this last April and have never had any problems with it. I also found a hack on the internet which makes it multi region and for that I have nothing but good things to say about this player.Battery Life about 2.5 hours and only seems to work with 5th gen 30GB and 80GB ipods.
1,New information Please READ THIS before buying!,"Looks like a great product and it might have been but... Ipod changed their software on the new 5th generation video ipods and they are not compatible with this docking system. I got mine and spent hours trying to make it work, I then called the philips helpline and at first was told that it was compatible and they walked me thru all the stages of making it work. When none of that did any good I was transfered to the tech support that does more than just read the trouble shooting manual and was then told of the ipod software changes and the incompatibility issues. The new ipods are designed to where you have to buy special ipod docking equipment. Long story short, this docking system only works with the older ipods."
1,Buyer Beware - Broke within a month!,"We bought this DVD player to play movies for our little guys while we're on the road. The very first time we used it, the movie froze several times and restarted itself...and these were movies that played flawlessly in our home DVD player, so scratches or smudges weren't an issue.A few weeks later, during another road trip, it froze yet another movie, and this time, it never restarted. We popped out the DVD, put another in, and that was it - the unit never recognized another DVD, and never played another second of video. Our children never had even touched the thing, and it was given absolute care and protection - a padded case, not left in the hot/cold car, only mommy and daddy allowed to operate it. I can't imagine why it would go kaput so fast, so I'm returning it for something else.Save your money - buy something else!!"
4,Value for monay,"Because of our international DVD collection I wanted a DVD player that could be region free and after some searching, this little Philips is the best deal around. A reviewer on Amazon.co.uk has provided the instructions to set the player to any region and it worked great.The player is light but sturdy and specifications (screen size and resolution) are what you expect for this price. Although the swivel screen seems to be coming loose from the rather flimsy looking attachment so it now wobbles."
4,"Light, works, seems durable enough for the kids","We were replacing a DVD player that has an exposed screen (unit wasn't a clamshell design that closes to protect the screen). Our 2yo stepped on it cracking the screen making it unusable. This Philips unit is much lighter which is good for us when traveling and good for the kids for keeping it on their laps. It worked right out of the box, as it should. We like most features other than the strange logic of only being able to charge when the unit is off, but other than that, seems like a good value so far."
1,WORST DVD PLAYER EVVVVVER!!! DO NOT BUY THIS...,"WORD TO EVERYONE!DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.IT DOES NOT WORK.IT WILL PAUSE IN THE MIDDLE OF PLAYING AND NEVER COME BACK ON.THE DOCKING SYSTEM HAS NEEEVER WORKED.THE FAST FORWARD/REWIND DOES NOT WORK AT ALL.YOU HAVE TO RESTART YOUR MOVIE AND WATCH OVER...THEN IT ALWAYS PAUSES AND STOPS.NEVER,EVER HAS IT WORKED.I HAVE HAD THIS A YEAR AND TAKE IT ON LONG TRIPS WITH HOPES OF ENTERTAINMENT.I AM ALLLLWWAAAYYYSS DISAPPOINTED.DOES NOT KEEP CHARGE. NEVER HAVE I COMPLETED A MOVIE ON THIS ITEM.PLEASE, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.REMEMBER, IT WILL NOT START MAGICALLY WORKING. EVER. I HOPED IT WOULD...NEVER DOES.IT IS A PIECE OF CRAP...HONESTLY.I DON'T WRITE REVIEWS, BUT I AM NOW ABOUT THIS...I WISH SOMEONE WOULD HAVE TOLD ME ABOUT THIS BEFORE I BOUGHT IT.OTHER REVIEWS...THE GOOD ONES...NOT TRUE.I THOUGHT THEY WERE WHEN I BOUGHT THIS BUT THEY WERE WROOOOOOOOOOOOOONG!!!!SAVE YOUR MONEY, FOLKS!"
1,Nice features - quick failure,"Philips typically makes products that look nice and have great features. The trouble is, they almost never last. My unit lasted six months. I should have paid the extra few bucks for a higher quality player from another company."
1,only 1 star cause it's expensive,A couple of years ago the price was 219.The price should have gone down.What gives?
1,Lost in transit,THis item was lost in transit and had to be re-ordered. The re-order arrived in the appropriate amount of time as indicated on the 2nd order.
4,Philips has a top of the line player,"This player is great,from sound, to colors, remote control; The only thing I wished it had was playback memory (when you stop/turn-off the DVD player, it doesn't remember the last place you left off). Other that this is a steal at the price."
2,Poor Audio Quality,"After my daughter dropped her Durabrand 9"" portable DVD player it was time to shop for a new one. I was unable to locate a new Durabrand 9"". The Philips 7"" was on sale for under $100 so I decided to go with a well established brand name. At the same time I decided to test the 7"" Durabrand. The Philips is much lighter and seems of poorer quality than the Durabrand. The sound comparison is incredible! The difference in quality from Durabrand to Philips was hands down in favor of Durabrand! The Philips sound is tinny and gives terrible static noise. The controls for Stop, On/Off, and Volume on the Philips were all poorly located and difficult to find and operate. I would not recommend the Philips and that surprises me. I had really hoped to be able to play iPod videos and home movies from my SD card but I'll wait until someone improves on the quality of these players and the cost is below $200."
2,"Like other negative reviewers, mine broke within a year","I bought this one to replace a Cyberhome 7"" portable. Unlike the Cyberhome, which I used like crazy, I've maybe seen a total of 3-4 movies on this thing in a year's time. I'm working from home today & decided to pop in a movie...battery will not charge and unit will NOT work unless plugged into the wall. My warranty runs out the end of the month & Philips offered me ""same or comparable"" model...I pray I don't have the same problem as some of the other reviewers. Other than that, the unit is great, picture is clear, sound is good.Note: Doesn't work with 6th gen iPod Classic. It'll output audio, but no video."
1,False Advertising,"This DVD player WILL NOT work with the new iPods . . . anyone interested, stay clear. This problem was identified within the first few minutes with Philips customer support . . . time for Philips to offer some deep, deep discounting since this product is sooo out of date."
4,does the job,Great little DVD player that does the job. Plays all DVDs and was able to watch my movies on my ipod through it. Only problem is that you have to charge it for about 6 hours just to get about 2 hours of play. So avoid those long movies. But we had it in the car for long journeys and plugged it into the car's power outlet so it wasn't too much of an issue for us.
2,I'm looking for a better one,Broke in less than six months with only moderate use. Screen output is bad. Power LED not working. Perhaps a voltage issue? dunno.After calling Philips and being assured that a 4gb sdhc card would work with the unit it turns out that it doesn't. Waste of $$ there due to Philips inability to properly support their product or document the specification.The swivel screen is great though because you can turn it around and lay it flat so your toddler can't mash all the buttons while watching in the car during that long car trip. Yet you can keep the remote and still control it.The truth is that I'll buy another one of these if I can't identify a better one with a swivel screen and flash card support. Longer battery life would also be great.
2,Broke after 1 year,"This product had good audio and screen, but after 1 year it stopped reading dvds. We cleaned it, but even with brand new discs it won't play."
3,Only for a 'naked' iPod,"If you are like me and iron-clad protect your iPod, the space for which the iPod is supposed to dock isn't sufficient. It has no wiggle room whatsoever so you'd better have a naked iPod if you plan on docking it. The remote looks cheesy, has too many buttons and so is rather user unfriendly; it fits into the iPod docking space when your iPod isn't in it. As an aside, I had bought an 'open box' one from Amazon and the DVD player part just kept stopping in mid-stream (yes, I did try several DVDs). I don't know if it was a defective machine to begin with -- perhaps someone returned a defective product to Amazon without informing Amazon that it is defective? So I myself had to return it to Amazon after a couple of futile attempts to play DVDs. So the main purpose of my review is just to warn you that you can only use this machine with a naked iPod, because I really can't fairly vouch for its quality or lack thereof!"
3,"Holds small bits, but not great","Bought this to hold small drill bits. It does, but as they get smaller they don't go in straight. I didn't really expect much for the price, but it feels like it should be less expensive than it even is. Three stars because it is a cheap way to adapt a larger chuck to hold the small wire bits and did the job I wanted it to do. But, depending on the job you need done and the bit size, it may not work for you. Holds small bits off center and at a slight angle so they don't spin straight and true. I was able to use it with a light touch on a hand drill so the drill itself moved around. Luckily I was drilling a shallow hole and tolerance wasn't important."
1,"Recieved wrong unit, no way to treat a Prime customer","The product I ordered was a dual fan 480 watt unit,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000N519KC/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_titlewhat I recieved was totally different - a single fan 330 watt TOTALunit. Even the box was different than the picture. The 12 voltrail only puts out 16 amps, as stated on the label of the unitrecieved. I pressume Amazon just packed and shippedthe wrong unit, NOT what I ordered and paid for. I am leftwith the decision to return the unit and pay shipping chargesor keep it and eat their mistake!"
5,"Solid Buid, Starts Fast and Bright","This is a well built product and is well-represented by the product images. The nickel finish is high quality and the alabaster-glass globes look great. Notably, this compact fluorescent fixture starts quite quickly and brightly. I was initially hesitant to buy as I've got several compact florescent bulbs (mostly spots) that take about 1 minute to warm up, starting out very dim, before they provide any decent light output. These 13W GU24 base units come on quite brightly the instant they are turned on, although the light output does seem to increase a bit over the next minute. We've installed in the bathroom and are very pleased to use about 40 watts to get the equivalent of about 180 watts of incandescent. Highly recommended."
5,Great Bagger,"The bagger was simple to set up. I had it up and going in just a few minutes. You have to pay attention to the bag full indicator. I unintentionally overfill it just about everytime.Overall, a great product and I don't regret the purchase."
5,Finally.....,"I am relatively new to Witchcraft, been practicing six years, yet even I am dismayed at the downward spiral that this religion has taken. Statements such as ""Witchcraft is a practice, not a religion"" and the even more deplorable ""I'm a Wiccan, not a Witch because I don't cast spells"" simply make me cringe.Also the lack of standards as to what makes one a Witch causes me to worry for the future of this religion.I praise Ellen Cannon Reed for having the guts to stand up and say enough is enough. I applaud her call for a return of standards and I give her kudos for caring enough about the Craft to wish for the abandonment of do-it-yourself Wicca.Every other religion out there has standards that one must maintain if they are to be considered as part of that religion. If we truly want to see the Craft elevated to the status that other religions enjoy, then we have to accept the hard facts we need some constants other than that we all worship when the moon is Full or at the Sabbats"
2,On the war path is more like it.....,"Reading this book is like attending a Wicca boot camp run by an angry author (who grits her teeth often) who at times is quite condescending and elitist. Anyone who is searching for their own path of spirituality that does not include rigid teachings and rules should avoid this book and read some of the more welcoming books on Wicca practices. Ellen Cannon Reed obviously knows her stuff and provides some interesting facts, but I found myself turned off by her rantings."
2,"Wicca 101, Again","The Heart of Wicca: Wise Words from a Crone on the Path is an admonition to Wiccans to take Wicca seriously. More precisely, it defines ""serious"" Wicca as the traditions, rituals, and beliefs made up by a coven (as opposed to solitary practitioners), which is then forced upon any who wish to join the coven. The greatest part of this book is spent building and reiterating this theme, with a few chapters in the back devoted to a cursory discussion of rituals, Sabbats, gods/goddesses, etc. With so many excellent beginning Wicca books on the market, new practitioners should not waste their money on The Heart of Wicca. Those of us who have been around longer will not pick up new insights here, and will have long since made up our minds as to what constitutes serious Wiccan practice."
2,Just not my cup of tea,"I was not impressed w/this book. Someone else had mentioned that it was preachy and I have to agree. But I'm going to take it one step further and say that I felt it was slightly condescending. Being that she claims she's a crone, I have to assume she's older and I got the ""I've been around longer and know more about this stuff than you young whipper snappers"" feeling from her writing. I was hoping to find something that would tell me something new, but not in this book. I gave it 1 extra star for the beautiful picture on the cover!I suggest Out of the Shadows by Lillith McLelland, you may not agree w/everything she says in that book either, but she makes a lot of good points."
3,Nice flares but didn't fit the way I wanted them too,"Purchased these flares for my 2000 4x4 ram pick up, rear flares fit the wheel wells perfect! the front flares fit the wheel opening good too, but extended past the front fender into the joint between front doors and fenders, that was the reason I sent them back. They would have liked great on my bronze colored truck, but I didn't want the salt & dirt to get trapped in behind the flares and erode the body. Can't seem to find any that will fit any better because of the short distance of the fender in that area."
4,Great razor,"This razor gives a great shave. Do your homework if you're going to switch to a safety razor from the more commercial multi-blades. It takes practice. But, ultimately, this is cheaper and gives a better shave."
4,I am so glad I switched over to a safety razor,"I had been using cartridge razors ever since I started shaving and I was generally ok with them until the day I decided to buy this safety razor. In all honesty, it has given me some of the best shaves I have ever had in my life. You wouldn't think that a single blade edge could possibly be better than a cartridge but it really is.To be fair, if its your first time using a safety razor you will need some practice. I know that the first time I tried using it I was somewhat let down because I practically butchered by face with it. This changed with just a little bit of practice and resisting the temptation to shave against the grain. Overall I have had some of the best shaves with this razor."
3,Good Razor,"First,I received the wrong razor head.I took a star off because this is a common issue that needs to be alleviated. Disappointing because I wanted to try a less aggressive open comb. It would be nice if they would send me the open comb piece if they have one lying around(yeah,right:). Still, it is a nice razor and gives a good smooth DE shave. I kept it because I had wanted to try a Merkur product at some point as I have been shaving with an old Gillette adjustable. I like the blade angle on this razor as it seems to make up for it not being particularly aggressive. I'm teaming it with100 Astra Superior Premium Platinum Double Edge Safety Razor BladesandProraso Shaving Cream With Eucalyptus Oil & Menthol (5.2 oz.),and it serves as a good combination."
5,merkur safety razor,"Can't say enough positive about this product. Sound like a sales pitch, but it actually makes shaving enjoyable. Handle could be longer for my big clumsey fingers, but that would detract from the nostalga factor. Use it to trim the edges of my beard, & the new multi-bladed gadgets clog up on the first stroke."
2,Wrong item received...,"The shipping was great, and the item was received in good condition. However, the wrong item was received - I ordered an ""open comb"" razor, and the box that it came in was marked ""open comb"". However, the razor was a ""closed comb"". I had to return the item unfortunately and would hesitate to re-order as I fear that I might receive the same ""closed comb"" razor."
5,My forever razor,"I love the feel, the style and the weight of this razor! I love that I will never buy another razor in my life. For a woman, I think this is the best choice out there. Did I say I LOVE IT? Guess I can't say it enough."
2,Not what I expected,The razor arm is extremely short and the single double edged blade that was provided was too dull to use. It was obviously in stock too long
2,Nice size and weight - flawed finish,"I have been using my Merkur 1904 razor for six months now and found it to have a flawed chrome plating where the blade meets the holder. This flaw in the plating seems to be causing rust spots on my blades. It is frustrating because the flaw is due to faulty workmanship - exterior surfaces on this razor are polished to a shine before plating, however the inside of the razor was not polished to a shine before plating. This is likely the cause of the plating flaw.This makes me hesitant to buy another Merkur because:1) I need to ship to Germany for a warranty claim - an extended period of time without my razor2) I read recently on Badger and Blade that people are having trouble with Merkur warranty claims since Merkur won't cover corrosion and plating flaws"
4,Nice and well built,"I just received this razor and I'm pleased with the construction. Although the handle is short, it's not to bad. I do wish I had opted for a longer handled razor instead. I do have to note, you have to be very careful replacing the blades. A butterfly type might be alittle safer, but if you keep your mind focused, this type will be ok. I won't comment at this time on the closeness of the shave since I just got this and I'm not a pro at using it yet. Does this make me like shaving? No. Does it make me want to wake up 10 minutes earlier to shave? No. If you are like me, and think shaving is a chore, this razor won't change your mind. BUT, it is nice, feels good and solid, will save you money. I based my rating on the razor itself and not on my opinion of shaving. If you are looking to try a safety razor, I will suggest this razor for what it is- a very well constructed, nice razor."
4,Firedside Woodwick Diffuser,"A friend had the smaller version and I loved the scent; that's what sent me on a search for a diffuser of my own. My only issue with the product is the loose way the top fits: I think it's kind of floppy. It would have benefited from a gasket or just a tighter fit (better design?). Otherwise, I love the smell - it's wonderful and not overwhelming."
3,Feels Relaxed,We used it for 6 months and saw significant improvement in our eye sight and also area around the eye. I use it on my forehead also.
1,I am glad to hear this worked for other people...,"...but black lint/particles were coming off of the product that I received, so I stopped using it and eventually threw it away. Don't really want to wake up from a nap with black particles on my face. Anyhow, great idea, poor execution."
2,Nice product.,"Nice product but limited coverage at least for my face(my face might be too big or too small, i dont' know)."
3,"Starts strong, loses its way","The first season is great. The second season is patchy. The third season is really poor.This show starts really well - the first few episodes are complete insanity, nicely held together with fantastic writing and lovable characters Unfortunately, it starts to go downhill from there. The clever writing makes way for increasingly slapstick humor, and you get the feeling the show has run out of ideas and is merely running its course. This is highlighted by the increasingly annoying ""laugh track"" - by the 3rd season every little thing results in the ""audience"" clapping as if they have witnessed comedy gold....when actually the joke wasn't even slightly funny. Always a sign a show is on its last legs. By the end it was actually a little bit embarrassing to watch.I would give the first season 4 stars. Second season 3 stars. Third season 1 star."
5,Fantastic British Comedy,"The combination of Dylan Moran and Bill Bailey is amazing. You really expect that there is a Black Books somewhere in London with these folks 'running' it, amidst their boozing and mania. There are some really great cameos as well, like Simon Pegg, Nick Frost and Pete Serafinowicz. This is a must for any fans of UK Sitcoms (though I am rather reluctant to use that term). And the price was really great too!"
5,Intelligent & Brilliant.,"Discovered this show while on a trip to the UK and fell in love instantly. Bought the complete set there at HMV and play it on my universal DVD. It's so refreshing and smart, with a great collection of characters! Love it!"
5,Black Books - traditional British dark humor,"A review simply can't do this series justice - you must view it for yourself. And once you do, you'll never forget it!"
5,Terrific! Funny and well acted,"I've been thoroughly enjoying this wonderful britcom that I hadn't heard of before. Not much happens plot-wise in these half-hour shows, but the characters are charming, strange and just flat out funny. The lead character, Bernard Black (Dylan Moran, who is also one of the creators) is a classic in sitcom history: misanthropic, incorrigible and totally lovable all at the same time. I highly recommend Black Books if you're a fan of Keeping Up Appearances, Are You Being Served? or Vicar of Dibley."
2,Too Big,"The loop end is too big and it is difficult to clean; thick soft plastic. The Ototek Loop is smaller, works better and cleans much easier; thin, hard plastic. The Ototek Loop can be found at Walgreens & CVS pharmacies."
4,Works great,Perfect for keeping those ears clean. Has a nice length that makes it easy to handle. Soft tip to avoid ear damage.
2,EAR WAX REMOVER,THE EAR WAX REMOVER DID MANAGE TO REMOVE SOME EXCESS WAX FROM MY EAR CANALBUT IT DID NOT DO AS GREAT A JOB AS A REQULAR Q-TIP.
3,"Movie, The Perfiect Crime","I saw this movie once and thought it be a good idea to share it with my family, especially those who speak mostly spanish."
4,How to alienate people by being a complete jackass.,"If I consider ""To the Confusion of Our Enemies"" Riverboat Gamblers' best album and ""Something to Crow About"" is worse, then by extrapolating we see that the debut album ""Riverboat Gamblers"" (original title, eh) should be worse the worst of the three. Fortunately, it's not, falling in-between the two others instead.For some reason I like it more than ""Something to Crow About"", even though the annoyingly repetitive and uninspired lyrics are still (already?) present. The whole thing is catchier, the songs are less homogeneous and the cover art is better.Wins all around."
5,the red pill,"This book will explain a thing or two about why the world seems a very dark place at the moment. If you require further convincing of the pure heart of darkness, or if you thought you understood real politics this book is for you.It is also a book for those who want the truth, and can take it. Who are willing to expose themselves to the real evils of this world, and hopefully be better equipped to deal with them?but I digress, on the authours website www.davesweb.cnchost.com/nwsltr65.html you can find some more information on the book."
3,Worked fine year one!,"I bought this gripper and had it for quite some time, it worked great the first year! After the first year and some good usage it started to have mechanical problems (the connection rod to the grips) several times this had to be straightened out and then finally it snapped and its useless. Oh and this is definitely not meant to be left out in the elements un-covered it began to rust and stick in the first year. So if your planned use is for the outdoors, store it when not in use or bring it indoors."
3,functional but labels detract,"Clever mechanism, easily picked up a fairly chunky piece of wood. However, people buy these to put by their fireplace so they need to have a certain esthetic appeal. Unfortunately, this unit comes plastered with 4 of those hellish sticky labels that are virtually impossible to remove. Ok, not impossible, but it took me a good 20 minutes to remove just two of them, one of which runs almost a third the length of the tongs. I tried orange oil, I tried hot water, I tried scraping (which scratched the finish). (see pic) I'll try to burn the other two off in a hot fire. All this when a simple warning label tag attached with a rubber band could have been used."
1,piece of junk.,"I got this thing out of the box, squeezed it to see if it worked, and the tension handle snapped right off...FIRST time I tried it. I really wish there were more available products not made in china, I would have gladly paid double for one that actually worked."
4,Needs a Spring Loaded Handle!,The absolute Perfect Tool around my campsite . . . . if it only had a spring loaded handle for true one handed operation!
3,I was looking for a fire pit poker!,"While browsing for a poker to use in my outdoor fire pit, I came across this fancy little ""claw"" looking device. It's neat, sturdily built, and is a great idea. I've enjoyed having it. However, I do have a complaint, and it has to do with it's design. Simply this, the tool is almost impossible for me to work with one hand, as it appears to be designed for. It works with two hands, but it's quite awkward. Maybe I just haven't used it enough. Anyway, I would recommend it to a friend, as I like the idea, but with an explanation of it's awkward design."
1,A piece of junk,"What a sad item this is. The handle part that you pull to close the tongs, closes them. But when you pull it back open (and yes you need 2 hands to do that), it doesn't re-open the tongs. Of course, since you just put a piece of wood into a fire... the tongs can be hot. But you can't use your hands to get them open. So basically what you have here is an item that allows you to put 1 piece of wood on a fire. Worthless is what it is."
3,Not what I expected.,"I was hoping for a spring loaded grabber, something that would open automatically like tongs and I could use to grab log. You have to open these manually and then grab logs. Other than that they are satisfactory enough, but not what I was hoping for."
4,log grabber,The log grabber isn't bad for the money. It would be nice if it had a spring to open the jaws.
3,A little awkward to use,It has a nice length to it--keeps your hands well away from the fire. It is a little awkward to use. It almost seems like it was designed backwards. I'll probably get use to it. It seems well constructed.
4,Grabber,"Well made and well designed. I use it mostly for moving cactus around when replanting. It knows no pain, as I might were i stuck stuck by a cactus. Of course it also works well with moving wood logs too, aflame or not."
5,LOVE IT!!,"Great product for an inexpensive price!!I have a fire pit in my back yard, and I use this all the time!"
5,Log Grabber,This grabber is perfect for packing in the basement of our 5th wheel when we take it on the road!!
5,Gotta have it!,"These are the best fire tools ever. I have bought 9 now! Everyone who sees ours wants one! It's a must have for your back yard firepit or in your camp trailer. What a conversation piece, people will come into your camp to check it out!"
5,Great for a Fire Pit,"After reading other reviews on other products that complained of the flimsiness of construction, we bought these log grabbers. They are really heavy duty and I can't imagine them bending or having any other problem. These log grabbers grab firmly and hold a smouldering log very well. We're managing an outdoor fire pit burning 17"" long pieces of split oak. I would recommend them to anyone serious about moving logs on a burning fire."
1,Poor quality,This thing was so cheap it broke the first time I ever tried to use it. Cheap plastic painted black to look like metal.
2,grabs and fireproof but bad ergonomics,"It works, but trying to grab a small log is a challenge. It's not worth buying this, but if you have it it's not worth returning it. Does this help?"
5,The Boy Friend Starring Twiggy,I love the Show! To view this 1971 movie in Panovision is a real delight. Twiggy performing as 'sweet natured' Polly is thoroughly charming. The cameo scenes are simply wonderful and just a little 'camp' at times which all blends into this happy melodrama.
1,Nothing of much interest here,"Gosh, I wanted to like this. I've been waiting a long time for it to come out on DVD. I love musicals, love tap dancing, love Tommy Tune and think Ken Russell's movie Women in Love is brilliant. So Ken Russell meets musical theater? How wonderful! NOT.First of all, it's dull. I kept waiting for it to pull me in with something: the story, the musical numbers, the dancing, a fun twist, given that this is Ken Russell...but it seems like just so much bad vaudeville. I enjoyed Glenda Jackson's cameos - she fully embodies the character in her scene with Twiggy.Some of the old musicals were really just an excuse for wonderful numbers - and you tolerated the boring parts waiting for the brilliance of, say, Fred Astaire and Eleanor Powell tapping to Begin the Beguine in the otherwise forgettable Broadway Melody of 1940. But I found nothing to ever watch again here."
4,Twiggy's show,"No this is not based on the original ""Boy Friend"", so all of you original fans will have to go elsewhere. I thought the original was outdated so was delighted with Ken Russell adding a backstage story and straight out going druggy.. I think 30 minutes should have been edited, (explains why it's only 4.)The main surprise in this movie is Twiggy. People who dismissed her as a phase in modeling should watch this. She sang wonderfully back in the 70's. She had a sweet gentle voice. I think the soundtrack of this movie should be released. I just bought the record and am happy with it. Also this movie is flat out magical. I had many daydreams about it when I was 15."
4,...a delightful romp of a musical...,"...this film is a little long (one number that is included was cut from release prints)--but full of so many visually delightful things it is easy to forgive a few excesses. There are Twiggy, Glenda Jackson (in a cameo) Christopher Cable, and Tommy Tune...just for starters. Then there are the stage sets by Tony Walton and the recreations of Busby Berkeley effects that are all the more delightful because here they are in color. And then there are the tap dancing jelly fish! Well, I think you can see that there are lots of treasures here to be enjoyed--and I certainly have enjoyed them--I hope that you will!"
2,the quality of the tape was very poor,the quality of the production was fine it was the merchandise which was faulty. The vendor has a case to answer in that regard.
4,The Boy Friend,"The product came exactly when it was supposed to. I got the sound track to see if it was a musical I would produce with my high school, but after listening to the music, I decided on another."
4,2nd best,"I liked this album back in the day, and I still like it now. Although it points the way toward the Zawinul-dominated band Weather Report would become, at least Zawinul still had interesting ideas at this point. Mysterious Traveler is their break away from their Miles Davis-influenced sound, and it would eventually yield mixed results. Here, though, it all sounds pretty fresh. Sure, there are lots of synthesizers and electronics, and if that bothers you, stay away. I tend to like it. Their previous album, Sweetnighter, was their best, but I like this one almost as much."
4,"If not the best, one of the best of Weather Report","Really cool album!! with marvelous atmospheric keyboards and soulful saxes!. This is Alphonso Johnson's astonishing incoming to the band, creating one of the most funky-jazzy rythm sections in the fusion scene, along with Dom Um Romao and Ishmael Wilburn. A must have if you are a fusion fan"
2,bor-ring,"After first buying WR's ""Heavy Weather"" I'd have to say that this album really disappointed me. Now it does have it's moments(nubian sundance), but all in all, I'm just not feeling this one.I didn't like the sound quality...but it wasnt all about that though. As opposed to ""Heavy Weather"" Songs like ""Cucumber slumber"" sound dated...Kinda puts me in the mind of a bad 70's blaxploitation movie, while other songs just plain put me to sleep. Basically it just doesn't have that funky/rock/jazzy sound that Jaco Pastorius brought to the mix."
5,Music that can't be imitated,"I can't believe the low rating people are giving this album, in my opinion the best Weather Report album ever.Mysterious Traveller, Nubian Sundance and Cucumber Slumber come to mind as suberbly crafed songs.Shorter is in his element on Mysterious Traveller. The keyboards throughout the album blend in perfectly and I feel don't dominate the other instruments.If I had to fault this CD, it would be due to the mediocre sound quality in some parts and lack of additional material.Nevertheless, it deserves 5 stars due to the fact that I'm reviewing the music on the CD, not the CD itself."
1,Music? Brilliant. Sound/Mix? Atrocious.,"I'm amazed at one of the previous reviews' lauding of the remastering of ""Mysterious Traveler."" While I haven't heard either the original LP or Columbia's first cd release, the quality of sound is an atrocity. Unlistenable. The high-end sounds--especially the open hi-hat--sound as tinny as a low-grade mp3. Needles in my ears. The mix--and I'm assuming this problem originated with the LP's release--is insane. The drums are barely audible. Complex, layered rhythms are buried beneath sludgy, grubby mid and low-end registers. The entire disc is, without exception, utterly unlistenable.It's frustrating, too, because the music itself is brilliant. So, I guess I can't say whether this remaster is to blame or if the problems were inherent in the original release. I just can't imagine it sounding worse. A tragedy."
2,New Age music before such a term existed,"It's diffcult to assess this release objectively, given that the main reason that I purchased it in the first place is to hear Wayne Shorter's distinctive saxophone phrasing; alas, he's barely heard amidst all the synthesized haze. If you want to hear ambient music in its embryonic stage, then by all means buy it; otherwise, stick with the Miles Davis Quintet recordings of the 60's"
3,Not too Bad,"I like this cd but it has a few problems. Overall it seems poorly produced( i'm not sure If I have this particular reissue but I'm talking rating it by the original.) Obviously moogs were still new technology. The sounds are good but not integrated too well. At any rate, I really tracks 1,3,5,2,4. Tracks 6 and 7 are both kind of weird. The bass player is good but pales in comparison with Jaco's work later on. So stick with Black market, heavy weather, and 8:30 but if you are a die hard try this on for size.Its good overall."
1,"More funky disco beats, but where's the jazz???","Wow this one makes thoer other cd's in comparsion actually seem more like jazz, this is thier worst set yet!!! Yucky, this isn't for those who like jazz, if you are heavily into disco or munk, than you will love this, however there are not enough jazz solos here to comphensate for all the discocrap! Sorry, I can appreciate Miles Davis B*tches Brew and even Herbie Hancock's Headhunters(to a degree), but this is more disco then jazz! Don't believe every 5 star review you read, or you'll get taken like me. This is NOT jazz, at least tot 200%, there's maybe 15% jazz here, and what there is of it, is very nice, but htere isn't enough here."
2,Adorable but worth it?,"I have to say that this model is just the cutest thing ever! It sounded like it had a lot of versitle features for such a small piece of equipment. I bought this item thinking it would be good for video taping my kids athletic tournaments (indoors sports), but soon discovered that the quality - similar to a camera phone - was just not up to the task I needed it to do.If you were using this device outside on a sunny day, standing no more than 12 feet from your slowly moving subject, it would be fine. I guess I got what I paid for - and ended up sending it back the next day.Moral: you won't get $350.00+ quality for $100 or less."
2,GRRRR,I am very frustrated with this... You need to have super great lighting to get anything worth while out of this thing. Everything would be great.... But make sure to have major lighting. Its very finiky in that way. Other wise the pics are great (with proper lighting) as well as the video. Works great as a webcam how ever doesnt zoom while in webcam mode.
4,my thoughts,"To save you a bunch of time trying to find this item in the store, this item is available online only."
1,jack of all trades expert at none.....,"i bought this camera mainly for taking snaps of things i sell on ebay i had a kodak 3800 digital camera but the thing is it did not have was a macro facility, which i needed to get really close up shots of rings, to show the details, well let me put it this way after taking pictures using the macro mode my wife said there is no difference to the pictures when i used my kodak without the macro facility, they were all blurred. at night when using it under normal house lighting everything looks pink even a new white sink, the finish quality of the camera could be its only good feature, for in a few years as old tin plate toys go up in value so should the tin body of this camera."
1,mustek dv4000 mpeg4,"Like most of you, I bought this camera on line. for my girl. It's a toy. quality is extremely poor (not at all the crisp images mustek is claiming) and compare with my old kodak dc210, it's a joke. I am really disappointed to buy a camera of 4m pixel, 6 years after my old 1m pixel and ending up with the most useless toy I ever bought. Now I know. If I need something good, I will stick to the big brands, big prices and will buy from a shop were I can test first.It's the worst present I ever offered to my child"
2,Don't buy it,"This camera is not worth looking into. I took it on a trip to Alaska and feel like i need to go back in order to get my memories back. the picture quality is horrible if the sun is not blaring. Don't even bother taking pics in low lighting. They come out blurry and grainy and the video cam feature is the same. Everything came out blurry and choppy and who makes a digital cam without a built in flash?! Waste of money. We bought it when it first came out and it was $300. Will never buy mustek product again. In defense of Mustek, shots no more than 10-12 feet away on a bright sunny day do come out great. But that's not realistic shooting circumstances. The more you zoom, the worse the quality."
3,Very poor picture quality,"I decided to try this camera for my daughter. She loves to make movies. She was very impressed with the size and the many functions. However, we decided to return the camera because the video quality was very poor. The overall camera quality also made us nervous. While it did not break, it certainly looks like it could at any moment. (maybe should be expected for this price)"
1,very dissapointed,"Like the other reviews, I feel the same way they do. It is convenient in size but the pictures and video are awlful. The instructions are terrible, I spend most of the first day trying to figure it out. I ordered from HSC and messed around with it for 2 days and it is going back. Everything on TV looks, feels and taste great doesn't it,,,,fooled again!"
1,Not Impressed,"I am very disappointed in this item. Photos have a strange hue that can't be eliminated with photo software. And yes, the zoom is impressive through the camera, but once you have recorded and look at your video, it is a blurry mess. It is also difficult to learn how to use and you have to teach yourself, because the owners manual is terrible."
3,help,can someone please tell me what the battery life is on the camera?does it have a flash?and what is the size of the lcd screen and if the screen rotatesThanks
1,Help Me,"I'm looking to buy this camera but I would like to see pictures taken by it at its highest resolution, I would really apreciate if anyone could contact me and send me some pictures at: mary_zap@hotmail.com"
3,Mustek DV 4000 - worth the money,"I've just purchased the Mustek DV 4000 and it's pretty much as I expected. The MP3 player is fine. Sound quality similar to other small players. The videos are what you'd expect from a small low cost camera. They are poorer quality than larger camcorders - but we knew that. I've found the camera very easy to use. It took about a half hour to sort out all the features.If you're looking for a tiny, multifunctional video camera which produces useable videos - in outdoor situations, than this device is for you. Alternatively, if you're looking for an MP3 player which also happens to serve as a part-time camera than this device is also for you."
1,Save your money.,"Looked very promising. But It constantly tries to auto focus. Every picture is blurry, the DV mode at the best qauailty freezes every other second. This is at best an exteremly over priced webcam."
2,"Mustek DV 4000, Didn't care for it",The picture quality is poor. Very dark. I had the lights on in the house. One on the ceiling & table lamps. It was so dark you could barely see anything on my computer. I did set the lighting on the camcorder & had the highest quality set. It has no flash so the camera option is just as dark indoors. It would probably be ok outside. I am sending it back where I bought it. Didn't care for it.
2,Mustek DV4000 MPEG4,"As amazing that the value of this digital camcorder perceives to be it lacks greatly on its ability to provide quality movie pictures. It offers a lot of bells and whistles for features but the output quality of both still and movie films is unacceptable. It is very convenient to use but again the picture quality is not even close to other 4.0 megapixel cameras. The movie pictures move with the grace of pictures you've seen shot from another planet, i.e., choppy and slow. Many of the still pictures are grainy. If you shoot this under low light the quality is especially poor even when you adjust for low light conditions. I'd recommend you save and spend your money on cameras more expensive that provide better quality."
1,Terrible performance,"This must be the worst performance of any opera I have seen. Costumes of the fifties, actors crawling on the floor. The arrogance of those directors who think they can improve on masterpieces. If it wouldn't be for the music I would burn this CD. Yuck."
1,Like 3-day-old pizza,"This is a very-poorly produced copy of the 1968 video-tape of this production. The sound is mono, and so is the color."
1,vinyl sheet and green hard plastic garden hose?????,By far the most disappointing thing I have ever bought from Amazon.comVinyl itself is very soft and light and flaps around even when you place it on the ground.This cheap piece of viny has a folded edge where you are supposed to insert pieces of supplied garden hose to make the border!!!Do not waste your money on this....please!!
4,Did the trick!,"I bought the carpad because I have a spot by my steps in the garage where the water was settling when snow and slush melted off my car. I live in Minnesota, so there's alot of it! When I got the carpad I installed it right away. The only problem I had was my own fault because I didn't let the hose warm up before installing it and it was still a little curly from being wound up, but it flattened out when we had a warm spell. I didn't put the hose piece on the end by the garage door because the drainage is good there and it's easier to drive over without it. It's also much easier to sweep it off when needed without the hose there. It's slippery if it's wet when you get out of the car, but not nearly as bad as having the whole floor wet I no longer have a big wet, slippery spot in front of my steps! The carpad keeps the water on it and not on the garage floor. I'm very glad I purchased it because it took care of my problem."
2,It works fine as long as it lasts,The CarPad works fine when new but it didn't last as long as I had hoped.The vinyl dries out and cracks after about 2 or 3 years and then it no longerprovides much value. It would be nicer if they used a better quality vinyl.
4,OH MY GOD!,"Have any of you ever heard of this guys? If the answer is ""NO"", you have no idea of what you're missing. The Flying Luttenbachers tottally destroy all the concepts of ""music"", of Harmony of evr'ything and the result is perfect: Noises, Noises and more Noises. Tottaly recomended for people that are bored with rock in general and want ""something new"". Not recomended: people who have sleeping problems (LOL)! That's it, like Mr. James Brown would say: They're good 'cause they don't hesitate!"
3,PROXIM LMR 400 ANTENNA CABLE,I did receive this product very fast. I ordered it on Friday and received it on Monday. The cable was the wrong length and wrong connectors so I sent the company (WIFI WORLD) an Email and they quickly corrected the mistake and I had the new cable by Friday. I was only concerned because they had to make me up a new cable for the length I had ordered.
2,Help I'm in a vampires body,"Jake and his friends accidentallly ease drop on one of thier science teachers conversations and over hear about theis machine he had built. So they decide to put into use on one of the school bullies, Barry. This machine is called DITS it is supposed to shrink things. So on Holloween night Andy meets barry at the school because thier going to give him a really big squirt gun Barry was wanting But of just giving it him the gun Andy decides to shrink his head but that could kill him. So when they go to stop him, the janitor catches them and the janitor is supposidy a vampire, when the janitor comes into the room every one goes and hides behind the DITS. When the janitor starts mopping the floor one of the boyes watches sstarts beeping and the janitor herd it, so he goes over to the DITS and the boys start to run but not before Jake trips on a wire and the water from the mop zapped the wires and switched jake and the vampires bodies."
1,13 year old advanced reader.,I personally thought this book STUNK! My older brother who is 15 (and in my opinion should by now be reading more advanced books) enjoyed this book ver much and has the whole series. But if your more like me you should probably stick with Lord of the rings and such. The author is deffinaly generated towards people around the age of 7 and 10!
4,Ear Candy,"Dylan Rice is a really good performer out of Chicago with a great voice and an uncanny instinct for writing memorable tunes. He covers a lot of ground on his debut, with rich melodies woven into an altrock and pop structure, tinged with melancholy and bittersweet recollections of relationships and life.My favorite songs on this disc are ""Distant Planet"" (shades of Bowie locked away in there), ""March of the Misunderstood"", and ""One Pure Thing"" -- all of which could be solid singles if people programming radio had a clue.If you like Emily Strand (whom I consider to be the female Dylan Rice), Aimee Mann, and Chris Isaak, you ought to like Dylan Rice."
2,Wrong!!!,"I ordered this product in 2005, I just loved the color and the pattern on it but I was sent the wrong size for my iPod, needless to say, I sent it back to the seller and received a full refund."
4,GREAT SHOES,I GOT THESE SHOES FOR X MASS 06 THEY LASTED FOR A GOOD 2 1/2 YEARS BEFORE THE OUTER SIDE STARTED TO RIP. I WAS ABLE TO PLAY ABOUT 2O GAMES IN THEM BEFORE THE SOLE STARTED TO RIP Oh AND I USED THEM FOR PRACTICE AS WELL.
4,A good score performed by pros at their peak.,"Rodgers and Hammerstein had touched on this kind of material before -- some say to better effect -- in ""The King and I,"" etc., but the original cast of ""The Sound of Music"" boasts Mary Martin singing her heart out, and, most especially, Patricia Neway as the Mother Abbess giving the most propulsive, muscular, go-out-there-and-win-one-for-the-Gipper performance of ""Climb Ev'vy Mountain"" you're ever likely to hear. This cut alone makes this album a must-have."
4,Dr. Singha's Mustard Rub,Mustard Rub 6 ozThis skin product is quite helpful for people with oily skin. With regular use it helps control blackheads and other acne problems. It has worked better than anything I have tried. Definitely worth the money.
5,Gerat stuff!,"It really works well for any aches and pains. It has a nice aroma, feels good going on, and the end result is very good."
4,Casca's Wild Geese adventure,"If any of you have seen the film ""The Wild Geese"" then you've got much of this story. The similarities to this book are many fold and its obvious that Sadler borrowed a little too much of that to make this story original.But that criticism aside it makes good readingas a bunch of mercs led by Casca and Gus go into an African dictator's country in the late 1970s with the intention of toppling his regime. They are of course betrayed and flee for safety, hotly pursued by vengeful Simbas.To see the world of Casca visit www.casca.net"
5,It doesn't matter what kind apple cider flavor as long it is Bragg,"ALL of BRAGG is organic (unfilter) and raw so be sure to shake! Some ppl can use 2 teaspoons but I can't! I tried 2tbps , it gave me a pain in side for some reason. I stick to one tps. From that day when I did one teaspoons, I felt great , clean , and detoxed not like I did with store-bought apple cider. I think I might had lose a little weight.Don't follow the instruction that say 1-2 tps, just do what your body or dr tell you. I did one teapoons because I knows my body only can handle it."
5,Wow! What a Great camera!,This camera is a bargain for anyone wanting an entry level digital SLR. You get 6.1mp with a lens. The camera body is lightweight and it is easy to use. I was able to take it out of the box put in batteries and a memory card and take great pictures right from the start. I bought some bigger lenses and they work great. I highly recommend this camera.
4,Just my opinion,One of my favorite albums from yesteryear. Some friends and I used to use it to rate certain stereo equipment. Particularly Pathway to Glory. Great classic Loggins and Messina.
3,Surprisingly good!,"Bought it for ""Pathway to Glory"", but generally enjoyed nearly all of it. Overlookfed and underrated were L&M generally."
4,Has Stood Up Over Time,"When L&M were recording, this album never quite captured me like Sittin' In, which I found to by lyrical, innocent, and romantic. This one is more worldly, expansive, and takes risks. 25+ years later, it holds up well. The reggae, the jazz elements, the nautical themes -- this is fine stuff. If you are new to L&M, I still recommend starting with Sittin' In. But don't neglect this gem, either."
5,Full Sail- What an Album (CD),"Full Sail is one of best albums ever recorded. Had it in the Mustang on 8-track. Had it on vinyl and CD, too. Every song on it is excellent. ""Love Song"" and ""Watching the River Run"" are timeless classics. Please pass this one on to future generations."
2,Be sure you look closely at the picture!,"Look close. See that little round tube in the front of the picture. That's what you're getting. It's the size of an XL syringe or so. I flipped the top of mine open twice before the hinge broke, though it is still sealable without the hinge. It's not what I'd call awesome, but then again, it's also very inexpensive."
4,It looks great on!,I was skeptical after the review that says the rings are the size of a pin head but that is not the case at all. It is a very tasteful necklace with a nice shine to it. It looks really nice on and I will wear it often.
3,It is Ok,"No doubt, kids love this game, but may not the product. When I received the product, I almost wanted to return it. The color of balls is not one as displayed. it is green and blue. So playing on grass, the green over green, not very comfortable, but still can see it. The little target ball is too small and not bright color, hard to find in grass. So I replace with a golf ball."
1,CHEAP,"Extremely cheap set!! Thought I was getting a deal, could have gotten this at a dollar store for probably less $$. The balls are super light and the carrying bag fell apart the first time i opened it. Seems more like a childs set."
3,"Classic Radio, Sadly Lacking Authenticity","If you like Stan Freberg and want to know what he was like on his radio show, this collection may be for you. If you are an old-time radio collector, this set it not for you. Radio Spirits, in their effort to make the show sound ""modern"", i.e. free of static and the record pops, has sanitized the recordings so as to be almost unrecognizable. The crushing blow was to run the whole thing through a low-pass filter which may have taken away rumble and some static, but also left the show sounding so tinny as to sadden the true collector. Anyone who's heard the original shows before Radio Spirits did what they did to them will also recognize that considerable editing has been done. Freberg's a genius, the shows are ingenius, what Radio Spirits did to them is nothing short of tragic."
2,V belt too tight.,"The V belt used to shift speed is too short. If the thumb screw is released, and the motor is pulled all the way forward, the belt is still too tight on the pullies. This is not good on the bearings in the motor or on the spindle. I contacted the company and they sent another belt of the same size. No help. Has anyone else had a similar problem?Mark"
4,Works nicely,"It's powerful and accurate machine. But the way it is designed for locking/unlocking before adjusting height is not convenient. Instruction is not accurate especially steps to adjusting drill depth. About the laser, the mounting/fine tuning mechanism is not good at all, in fact, I do not think a drill press with such a laser device can improve efficiency of the tool at all. I wish it were an optional accessory while placing this order so I did not have to pay for such useless part. But overall, a good drill press. About the packing, the outer box is nearly totally damaged when delivered by UPS; and contents inside were exposed, lucky for me, nothing inside was damaged or lost."
5,Excellent Drill Press,This is my first drill press. It came out of the box and wasn't hard to put together. Set up was easy. Just make sure to give yourself an hour.
1,delta drill press DP300L Junk,I have replaced the worm & pinion gears two months agothey wore out already.would not buy delta drill press again
4,Good tool some small issues,"I am overall satisfied with the tool.It is a little difficult to adjust precisely the depth stop.Same with the laser. I actually found that I need to recalibrate the lasers each time I change the table height slighty if I want them to be dead accurate.UPDATE: I now have used this drill press for almost a year and stick with my original review. The tool is still functionning properly. I had a chance to use the different speeds to bore bigger holes, it is a little annoying to have to move the belt but the operation is overall easy. The tool is working as it did the first time I powered it, there is no noticable play.Overall a good buy."
5,First Drill Press,"Arrived in great condition, took > 30 min to put together, works great. This is my first drill press so I don't have anything else to compare it to, but for my hobby needs it is a great addition to my shop."
1,Bad Packaging,"I ordered this from Amazon. When it first arrived the box was crushed and the chuck/chuck key was on the laying on my driveway about 6 feet from the box. When I opened the box I found that the Styrofoam was crushed and parts were loosely bouncing around inside. When I pulled the head out I found that it had rust marks all over it and the motor appeared to be corroded. There was also sand all over the motor. It was almost like the head was dropped on a beach.So I returned that package and asked for a replacement. The second box arrived in better condition, but when I pulled out the drill press head, it was again rusty, corroded, and had sand sticking to it. This box is being returned for a refund."
1,Delta Drill Press DP300L,"This item was delivered with defective worm gear assembly. Rather than sending the whole drill press back, I contacted Delta and told them that the table and worm gear were defective. The absolutely refused to send the parts and insisted that I contact my ""local"" Delta repair service (about 1.5 hours from my location) I contacted the service center and they said that they no longer stock Delta parts and I would have to bring the drill press into their facility and it might be weeks before they can get the parts. What a load of crap!I will NEVER buy another Delta tool as a result of this issue.I returned the drill press for a replacement from the vendor. I will update this review when I get the replacement."
5,"So Pretty, Pretty!","I LOVE pretty stories with sweet pictures, and vice versa! This is a sweet little chapter book with adorable little pictures. I can't wait to give this to my Godchildren for Christmas. Makes life look like what we all wish it could be...simple, sweet, precious!"
3,Opus Campus,"The Bronislau Kaper score for the (in)famous MGM biblical turkey, 'The Prodigal,' is one massive, over-the-top musical work. The recording is presented in full stereo and it is quite a spectacle by itself, from pseudoreligious incantations to bachanalia, it covers a lot of ground. But it is too much for something that, though fun, is not that interesting. The same themes are played over and over including 2 finales that sound the same to my ears. Personally, I prefer Mr. Kaper's jazzy scores for 'Butterfield 8' and 'Go Naked In The World'. As for ancient times Hollywood soundtracks I think you're better off with Alfred Newman ('The Robe' and 'The Egyptian') - they're both available at the Amazon MP3 Downloads at bargain prices."
5,Great insight.,"If you need more insight into the book of Acts and the life of the Apostle Paul, then this is a necessary addition to your library. In fact, I trust the New American Commentary available on many of the books of the bible."
3,Too Brief,"Polhill's commentary on Acts would be helpful to many students of the scripture. However, it tends to be very brief. Serious students might look elseware."
4,Get Your Classic Jazz Funk Here!,"I agree with Christopher Payne on everything but his response. This album is classic early-'70s cross-over jazz-funk. It is very twangy and crunchy and should most definitely give you the munchies! It is jazz that you can shake your booty to! Squeeze into your platforms and big bells, hang a few medallions around your neck, un-button that polyester print shirt to your navel, pour yourself some brandy, smoke a little ""mother nature,"" and get down!!! Then try -- just try -- to get these exuberant tunes out of your head. You're gonna luv it!"
1,Not a good choice,"I accidentally bought this CD and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. While Ramsey Lewis is fantastic and any number of CD's here on sale are great additions to any collection, this is a horrible piece of history: reconfigured songs using the twangy electric guitars and Moog synthesizers of the late 60's/early 70's. Sounds like a soundtrack to a bad old ""mod"" movie."
2,Well written. Terribly produced.,"I first came across this book at the library and thoroughly enjoyed the read. Well written. Engaging. It's great. However, this paperback edition is so poorly produced I find it impossible to read. The type is uneven -- letters vary in thickness and some parts of the page are darker then others. It's painful and frustrating. I would check your local libary for a hardback edition before buying the paperback. Truly a shame."
2,Not the best purchase ever,"I got a new car that doesn't have a tapedeck and have been struggling to find something that will play tapes and my iPod. I bought an iTrip that didn't work and then I bought this, which is chock full of static on the 4 stations when I use it with the iPod but it works really really well with a Walkman tape deck. It doesn't sit well with the iPod and is very awkward, spinning around, which I think contributes to why it doesn't maintain the connection with the stereo, but it fits nicely with the Walkman."
1,don't make the same mistake i did...,"I bought this thinking I had a sure fire solution to my radio problem. My car only has a cassette deck and it doesn't work. I saw that this was compatible with IPods and portable CD players and thought it was a dream come true. Now I'm wishing I had saved the 26.43 I spent on batteries and this piece of junk. It DOESNT WORK. It offers you four frequencies. 88.1, 88.3, 88.5 and of course 88.7. However it doesn't tell you that on the package. After you spend 20 dollars on it you find this out. Lucky for me only one of those stations is occupied. Too bad the other 3 stations end up being nothing but static. For a second I thought I could hear some of my music but after hours now of tinkering I've come to the conclusion that it must've been my imagination. DONT BUY THIS. If you really want to though, just send me the twenty bucks and I'll send you a tape of static noise, because that's all your getting with this."
1,Garbage,"This little piece of worthless plastic trash does absolutely nothing. Batteries are in, iPod is on, doesn't work on any radio in the house, on any frequency, and does not work in the car. Oh, correction, it worked for about 2 seconds in the car, but was immediately overcome by static, and did not work again. Please do not waste your hard-earned money on this. Maxell, please stop ripping off America. Thanks."
4,Great for the price!,"I just bought this and am now listening to my iPod through my home stereo. Unlike the previous reviewer, I had no difficulty selecting a radio station (all four stations, 88.1, 88.3, 88.5 and 88.7 appear to work fine), or getting static instead of music.The sound is good, and the only time I get any significant static is when I move the iPod a few feet away from my stereo receiver. Considering the low price of the item, I am very pleasantly surprised."
3,Maxell P-13 Stereo FM Transmitter,Overall the product works well. It's a little bulky and the sound quality is slightly less then the radio but besides that it works fine.
2,Awful. Avoid.,"This item does not work well. The sound is poor, there is intermittent static and it drifts in and out while driving. You will find yourself spending way too much time fussing with it while you are trying to drive.In addition, the design is AWFUL. It pivots around on the headphone jack and does not stay stable at all. In addition, the on/off button is placed in such a way that you can virtually guarantee that you will accidentally turn it on if you put this in a pocket, briefcase, backpack. Really embarassingly poor design, you have to wonder how they can come up with something this bad.Don't buy this item."
4,Great but a little thick,"Bowl is large and heavy, but it is a TAD thick, and I wish the bottom were fired so it wouldn't scratch as much. Seems to be built well and is great for cereals, pasta, and even a small side salad."
5,Love Fiestaware!,"I am a new fan of this line - I needed something that I couldn't crack, since my old dishes were all chipped in some form. Fiestaware can hold up to my family's stress! I have clanked, banged, and clinked these dishes and not a scuff on any of them! When I received this piece, it was very well wrapped and protected."
4,Great Commentary,This is a great reference tool for students of serious Bible Study. I have been slowly collecting the series for my library and don't regret any of them.
3,Black?,One of the questions that is delt with many times in science fiction is the enemy so evil that it must be completely eliminated or can some of it be saved. Here the author pointed out how evil some evil is and that it must be rooted out completely.
3,Mediocre at best,"I really wanted to like this book but its almost like the author squeezed a 3 book series into a few hundred pages. All of the encounters were extremely brief, very light on detail, and in the end all seem to magically work out perfectly. The science is beyond vague, nothing is really explained more than in passing, and your left with the feeling that you arent actually reading a book but hearing a brief synopsis from a friend who read it.Its an interesting idea and I think it would make a great book if more time was spent on explaining exactly whats going on, why, how, etc. Give us some details dont just rush all the major stuff in a few pages."
1,The Black Galaxy,"I am going to do the author a favor and recommend that he have his work edited before submission. With major editing, the book might be a readable story. I could go no farther after Chapter 7 and had to give it up."
5,Singing with presence,"The piano part is not without bad moments, the recording is quite bright, but yet there is not a unpleasant hard edge in singers voice one might imagine. Instead there is a lot of presence and maturity of great artist that made me stop and listen wonderful interpretation of familiar songs. If artists like Seefried and Jurinac are your favorites, I bet you'll appreciate Grümmer as well - try Abendempfindung to start. Quality/price ratio is exceptional."
5,A must tool for any who desire to know or follow Christ,"Written with the ""amateurs,"" this book states very clearly how Christ alone makes the most logical option for knowing truth. Also, as an aid to faith, the book details ""apologetics"" (giving an explanation or reason), revealing many ways to make sense of, and to use as a defense ""for the hope that is within us."" If you have ever struggled to answer the most difficult questions in life, this is the book for you."
4,"Excellent for Personal Reading, Small Groups and Sunday School","I purchased this book as part of a Sunday School cirric. and the format, questions and discussions that follow are perfect for what I described in the above title. Also, Norm Geisler is an excellent Christian apologist so this book is not light or weak by any means but well thought through while not dense and foreboding."
2,Elementary answers...,"The answers in this book are way too condensed and simple. Doesn't thouroughly answer the questions that are brought forth and takes snippets from other books on these topics for its' answers, such as ""When Skeptics Ask"" and ""Case for Christ.""If you are looking for answers to tough questions pick up ""When Skeptics Ask"" ""Case for Christ"" ""Kingdom of the Cults"" and ""Evidence that Demands a Verdict""This book leaves a lot to be desired and expected more being that Ravi was the General Editor of this book and also ""Kingdom of the Cults"""
3,Should have been better,"I figured that a book put together by Ravi Zacharias and Norman Geisler would have been organized better. The book is very simple. It might be at a coffee shop philosophy level. I guess I was looking for a book that would give more detailed answers. I guess it might be a good introductory book on apologetics, but it may be too simple for that even. I usually love anything by Geisler or Zacharias, however this book just wasn't good enough."
2,maybe 2 and ahalf stars,"I saw this film awhile ago but remember it pretty clearly. I would have to categorize it as a ""nice try"". It definitely has a visual style and a kind of ominous undertone but the weakness of the script hurts it immeasurably. The characters are one dimensional and hollow and their actions have no basis in reality. It seems to be merely an excercise in style. If something like this is what you're after, check out Danny Boyle's Shallow Grave.and PS, what's with the ballot stuffing? These reviews all sound like they came right out of a press release."
1,the wind BLOWS,"This is quite possibly the worst film. Ever. The acting was dramatically chiche and just plain BAD. The director was attempting artful Quentin Tarantino-like shots, but completely missed. And the soundtrack? I think it happened like this: ""Hey guys, I have a friend who has this keyboard and he could totally score this movie if we gave him 15 bucks.""And the whole, ""If you don't like The Wind, you totally don't get it"" thing doesn't hold water. The script is completely unengaging besides the fact that it doesn't even much sense. So, if you like, rent or buy this movie if you don't mind paying good $$ to waste 2 hours of your life that you will never get back."
1,THIS WIND BLOWS,"To get to the point, THE WIND is just that---a big gust of emptiness, illogical writing, inept acting and imaginative but uninspired direction. After starting off with the apocalyptic wrath of the wind, the movie shows us typical teenage stereotypes doing typically stereotypical things. A real waste of time and/or money. Don't bother."
1,Blowin' in the wind,Young people commit murder in a woods. They start acting strange. Chick gets heavy breathing phone calls. Many Meaningful Looks are exchanged.What does it all mean? You'll lose an hour and a half of a life that you'll never get back if you watch this yawnfest. That's what it means.
