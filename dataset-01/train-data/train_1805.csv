5,The Best Jazz Album of the Year!,"I am not exaggerating. Anthony Wilson (son of Gerald) is the best jazz composer/arranger to come on the scene in years. In Adult Themes, he has put together an absolutely gorgeous album, with top notch musicians (including Pete Christlieb), melodies and arrangements. While innovative in his own right, Wilson seems very influenced by Charles Mingus in his compositions and arrangements, and by Pat Metheny in his (very nuanced) guitar work. If you are a fan of those two giants, chances are that you will greatly enjoy this album. The five-part title piece alone is worth more than the price of admission."
5,"Truly a ""handbook"" for Waldorf parenting","Written to meet the needs of parents interested in Waldorf Education this book has a practical and philosophical basis. This handbook traces in great detail the physical, psychological and intellectual growth of the child from conception through adolescence. Also explains how Waldorf education supports and nurtures the thought, feeling and will forces of the developing individuality.It is easy to read and full of information particularly for families new to Waldorf Education. It covers the full spectrum of development including pre-birth, the 1st three years, temperaments, fantasy play and then gives a description of the grades. The book answers a lot of the ""why do they do it that way"" questions that people often ask about Waldorf Education."
1,This tool failed after 30 minutes of use,"The switch on this Anniversary Edition is flimsey plastic and the tool quit after 1/2 hr of use. Dremel promptly replaced the tool with a 300i free of charge; that one has a real switch and works great. The Anniversary Edition comes with a nice retro tin box and a pocket knife, which are nice touches, but the tool itself was no good (at least in my case). If you are looking for a multi-speed Dremel tool just buy the 300 series and skip this Anniversary Edition."
5,Great Christmas Present,"I bought this for my grandson.He will be so excited Christmas Morning. He will remeber me every time he uses it, long after I'm gone."
4,"Great camera, but flash isn't so great.","I like this camera, it's a little bigger than a credit card and pretty stylish.Pros: Sturdy body, big lcd, easy to use buttons, video mode with sound, great images outdoors, slideshows.Cons: Horrible images indoors at night w/ flash.So far I've had this camera for about 2 days and I love it. It's easy to upload the pictures, but put your camera in the dock and plug in the usb cord and follow the steps on the screen. If you want to play slideshows, just put the camera in the dock and plug in the a/v cords and there you have it. I recommend buying a 512 mb type-m xdcard if you're planning to take a lot of pictures. With the 16mb card it came with, i took about 6 or 7 pictures and a small video. I took a few pictuers at night and sometimes when I turned on the flash, the whole picture would be white. When I turned off the flash, the picture was grainy and unclear. Overall, the Fujifilm Finepix z1 is a easy to use camera with nice picture quality."
5,Great Camera,"I really love this camera. There is no easier camera to use. The thing I like best about it is that all you have to do is press a button to view the picture you just took. It literally takes less than a second. If looks are important to you, this is the camera for you. EVERY time I pull it out, I get a ""wow!"" Not to mention, it has the coolest ""power on"" ever. The front of the camera slides to the side to reveal the lense. AND the screen just really doesn't scratch. The ONLY thing I don't like about it is that there is a very slight pause after you take the picture. But, the quality makes up for that. Love it."
3,Good and Bad,"I'm enjoying the Z1. Picture quality is decent. It has good low-light imaging and I really like the fact that it has the sliding lens cover. What I don't like is that it uses a non-standard USB port and will not charge off the USB connection, so you must lug the cradle and power supply around with you when you travel."
4,love it!,"I love this camera! It's light and little. Perfect for everyday photography.It's easy to use. Just slide the front cover open and you're ready to shoot. It takes good pictures in low light and the macro mode is fantastic!My only complaint is the way you transfer the pictures. The camera comes with a dock. The dock has to be connected to an outlet through a AC power adapter and to upload you have to hook the USB cord to all of that. You have to dock the camera in order for the pictures to transfer. I usually use my pictures for school projects where I have to upload them on to the computers at school. I don't want to have to carry around the dock, the AC adapter, and the USB cord just to upload a few pictures. I going to be getting a xD card reader. It would be so much easier if they made it so you could plug the usb cord directly into the camera.Other than that, I have no problems recommending it to anyone looking for a fun little camera."
1,Grainy Shots,"Buyer beware! I bought this camera and tested it out by taking indoor and night shots. I downloaded them to my PC (which was very easy) and the pictures were grainy and many were out of focus. The picture quality was worse than most compressed .jpg's that receive via email. I have an older Olympus C-3000 which takes terrific pictures (indoors, night time, etc.). I am used to much higher quality shots. The Olympus has a much larger lens, which I think has something to do with it. I took the Fujifilm back and am sticking with my older Olympus for now. I am extremely disappointed, especially since Best Buy charged me a 15% restocking fee ($60)!"
5,"Camera for the ""not-so-picky""","This camera does not have so many features, unlike the ones that a real 'pro' on digital camera is looking for. It is not overpriced and the quality is not the best but I'd say very good. It does not come with a leather case because you don't need one. The lcd display has a thick protective glass like a scratchproof material (just don't drop it for a test or something). It is so small that's why it's called portable. If you have big hands naturally this is not for you. All digital cameras have different features of their own, you just have to read the manual to be able to appreciate fully what you got."
1,"Great Camera, lousy service.","I bought this camera for my daughter. She loves it, but it lost the sound recorder. I took it in to the Fujifilm service center, which happens to be located where I live and they can't even look at it for at least a month. There are no other alternative servicing facilities with a quicker response. It is the worst service time I have ever heard of. I would not buy another Fujifilm camera."
2,"Cute, but lousy pictures","It is a cute little gadget, for the price I thought it would take better photos. Indoor photos look out of focus and grainy, I love my cannon. S-70."
1,Stay away,"Do yourself a favor and stay away from this camera. I returned mine after trying every possible combination of every possible setting and realizing that at best this camera takes pictures that are mediocre. At worst they're unusable, and most pictures fell into that second category. I have an older 3.2 megapixel Canon that takes significantly better pictures than this 5.1 megapixel camera. I bumped into someone at a party who had this Fuji, and they had pretty much the same opinion of it. About the only reason I can even give this camera 1 star is because of its compact size and portability. But, what good is that if the pictures are horrible? If you are considering this camera, I strongly recommend you take a look at the Canon PowerShot SD450 instead. It's very similar in size and price, but takes pictures (and videos) that are in another class entirely. It totally blows this camera away."
4,"Pocket Companion as a good review, esp. before you sleep!!","This pocket companion serves as a concise overview of the most important facts & concepts from the parent textbook (Guyton's Textbook of Medical Physiology). However, it does not contain all the details or some clinical relevances, that's why you have to go back to the parent textbok for furthur info."
4,Much better than the big book!,"Lets be realisitic. In medical school who has the luxury of reading the text book from cover to cover? No one! If your class is following Guyton, forget the big book and follow this instead. It is pointless to read the big book because it is far to dilute. The important points become difficult to pick out. Rather than being dilute, this pocket book is concise and it gives information in a narative, not bullet point, format that makes it a quick read. I will give a warning, however. Although this book is much better than the big Guyton textbook, you may find it, just like the big book, deficient in only a few points needed for USMLE step 1. However, no source is perfect!"
4,Very rhythmic,"My son and I started reading this when he was eight months old. It is just short enough to keep his attention span interested, but the rhyme helps him learn to love his books. (Also short enought to memorize in case you lose it for a day under the couch!) A must for baby's bedtime routine."
3,"OK, not a first choice","This book is cute, up to Sandra Boyton's usual very funny standard, but it is not all that great for toddlers and preschoolers--just before bed they all go out to exercise vigorously which is exactly the wrong message to give kids at that time of day!. I read this to my older daughter when she was 2-4; it never really clicked. My 2nd (a boy) wasn't much interested in books unless they involved anything with wheels or firemen so I don't think we ever read this. Now on my 2nd daughter; it just doesn't excite us. There are so many other wonderful baby/toddler/preschool books out there, choose another, like Boyton's Moo Baa for the very 1st book (ours got completely worn out) Barnyard Dance which is just hysterically funny, or the Sheep in A Jeep/Shop etc series, or The Runaway Bunny or Jamberry or Jesse Bear... Those are truely GREAT. This one is just Ok."
4,one year old not interested yet,"My one year old doesn't like this book, yet. I know she will love it in a year. Right now, she just flips the pages as fast as she can, so she can get another book. I like the book. It is really cute."
4,Pretty good,I usually read this book to my toddler son before bedtime. It's a cute book and I like it more than some of this authors other works but it's not one of her best ones either.
4,going-to-bed-book,"It's cute. My great grandson will be reading it by himself before long. He's 3 and very bright, but aren't they all."
5,A faboo bedtime book,"Another book we got for our daughter as an infant and wore out in the rereading of it. Interesting, relatable (comparing the animals bedtime activities), and calming. Highly recommended."
4,It's a simple story,"I love my infant son and when he gets bigger I'll enjoy reading him stories like huck finn and so on but while he's a baby I tend to put reading to him off, mostly because his mother takes care of it. I like this story. It's rhyming with neat pictures and it's short and sweet. You can read it 3-4 times to your child in a few minutes and if you emphasize the repetitions they really dig it."
5,Going to Bed: Then and Now,"When I was a toddler I requested my parents read me this book so often that they actually had to hide the book! Now as the mother of a young baby myself I can assert that this is one of my son's favorites as well. We read it to him every night as part of his bedtime routine and he's completely engrossed. Not to mention the last two pages especially engender a certain rhythmic drowsiness all on their own! By the time we've finished reading this book to him, all we have to do is say goodnight and leave the room and he doesn't even fuss--just goes straight to sleep.As both the readee and reader, I adore this book! It also comes in a Spanish version--I have both and alternate because I'm trying to teach my son Spanish."
5,Wonderful bedtime book,"I read this book to my infant daughter every night during her last feeding before bedtime. By the time I get to the end of this short book her eyes are heavy and her breathing slow. I love the book's bright colors and sweet, short story about getting ready for bed. I know my baby will come to love it too as she gets older."
5,Great Bed Time Book,"My son loves listening to this book before bed at night. He is now 3 years old, and still loves to read this book along with other longer books, such as Green Eggs and Ham, or Bad Dog Marley. I have read this book to him so many times that I have it memorized "" The sun has set not long ago...now everybody goes below...to take a bath in one big tub, with soap all over, scrub, scrub, scrub."" It's a great book for bedtime, because in the end of the book all the characters go to bed. Nice way to get him to think about sleeping."
4,Part of our collection,"We like most of Sandra Boynton's books. This, is not my favourite but we were looking for bedtime books so this one works well for that. I just hope the baby outgrows it before I have to explain why they go exercise AFTER they get ready for bed - LOL"
5,Boynton never lets us down!,Another great Boynton classic with funny pictures and not a lot of words on every page. Whole family likes this one!
5,Our favorite bed time book!,We love this book (well all of her books!) and this one has been many a gift for friends and family! We read it every night and our older son can quote it word for word now!
5,Fun! Fun! Fun!,"We love this book! It's lots of fun to read: good rhyming and cute imagery for little kids (very young ones). My daughter now recites it back to me! It encourages tooth-brushing, bath-taking and putting on pajamas."
5,Sooo cute!,"Sandra Boynton is one of my favorite children's book authors! All of her books are written well and very easy to read to the little ones! I started reading The Going to Bed Book when my daughter was only a few weeks old and now she picks out this book on her own to read! She also loves Fuzzy Fuzzy...I believe thats the title. If you are looking for good quality books to read to your baby and toddler, you can't go wrong with Sandra Boynton! Even my husband loves her books! Give them a try, you won't be dissapointed!!!"
4,A great chaser...for snooze time,"This is a great snooze-time book, although our child prefers the Margaret Wise Brown classics (Big Red Barn, Goodnight Moon) before going to bed, this whopper-sized book makes for a great chaser. If that doesn't work, I just find an additional book. The reason I'm giving this book 4 stars is that the animals take a bath and get into pajamas before excercising and going to bed. Excercising before going to bed? Taking a bath before excercising? What are these animals thinking?"
4,Sandra Boynton Books,"My son loves Sandra Boynton books and always picks them for his bedtime stories. I love them and enjoy the ease and simplicity of the books. He is not reading yet, but we have read them so many times he can repeat them back to me. Very fun books."
4,"Cute, but I'm not sure what the rave is all about","This is a good book, but compared to many others I've seen I wouldn't call it exceptional. I think the ratings are a bit inflated."
2,"It was great until the ""exercise"" part!","I love the Boynton images, and so does my daughter. We love Blue Hat, Green Hat and Opposites, BUT...The Going To Bed Book is humming along nicely, and then...exercise? Yup. That's one of the things Boynton shows kids to do before bed. Damaging? Of course not. But accurate? I don't think so. And as one is trying to teach toddlers - who take everything literally - what happens before bed...I had to send this one back.Bummer."
3,cute but short,lots of books like this not many ever stand out. This one is cute but blends right in to most other books in my daughters collection. Dr. Suess still hits a home run in my house everytime
2,Much better books available,This book does nothing to prepare children to go to bed. There are much better bedtime books available. This book has no storyline.
1,Exercising BEFORE bed?,"I like the rest of the book but I just can't get passed the idea of exercising right before going to bed. Had the author lost her marbles when she wrote this? Who exercises right before going to bed, especially kids!? The bed-time routine is a winding down and calming experience, not a winding up one! Terrible book!"
5,Charming!,"This is absolutely wonderful and so far the only book my girls really love. It's easy to read the story in an animated way and you can make believe with your kids that you're scrubbing up, brushing your teeth and rocking right along with the characters in the book. It's just short enough and charming enough that I haven't gotten tired of reading it to them yet :)"
5,Love it,I love this book and I love reading it to my nephew. I thing I love it more than he does. It also help to get him use to the bed time process.
4,Great,We love all of S. BOYNTON`s books. Cute short and lots of fun. You can't go wrong with this one.
2,Thrown to the side!,"My 14-month old daughter loves books, but for some reason she lost interest after two pages and hasn't picked it up since (in three months). Disappointing because I think it's cute, but for some reason it didn't hold her attention for more than a minute. The same is true with the other Boynton book Doggies. Her illustrations might be too subtle and busy for this age so we'll try again later."
4,A fun book to read that winds down to put them to sleep,"This is one of our two favorite bedtime books. Sandra Boynton, as usual, writes a book that children and adults both enjoy: it walks the through typical going to bed routine of taking a bath and putting on pajamas and brushing teeth... but then ""when the moon is on the rise / they all go up to exercise."" What? Who goes up to exercise after taking a bath, and right before bed? Exercise right before bed is a formula for staying away more energized, not going to sleep!Fortunately, we don't have to imitate the characters to enjoy the book. The really strong point is the way that Boynton controls the sounds and rhythms here: it has such a flow to it that my wife and I both memorized it in short order, and by the end it has such a beautiful swaying lilt: ""The moon is high, the sea is deep, / They rock, and rock, and rock to sleep.""It's not Shakespeare, but it usually does the trick!"
4,Yup.,"It's cool. It rhymes. The meter's good. It's cute and has animals in it and talks about going to sleep, which is probably what I should do."
4,Lovely Book,"My daughter has had this book since she was a baby and she has now just turned 3 and has handed the book down to my son so it will no doubt be read many, many more times as he gets older. As with many of the Boynton books we own the verse is insanely catchy and my husband, daughter and I can recite quite a few of them without having to actually 'read' the words. This book is fun and engaging, a great, short bedtime story for little ones."
3,Cute but confusing,"I love Sandra Boynton's books for their sing-song verse and adorable illustrations; but my 14-month-old loves only some of them. This one is a bit confusing for her, I believe. Just when her vocabulary is taking off, this book hits her with some animals that even I can't positively identify. The animals are on a boat, which doesn't make sense out of context. After bathing and just before bed, they engage in vigorous exercise, for some reason. The book seems to present a bedtime routine and seems designed to read to your child during his/her bedtime routine, but I'm finally deciding we're better off shelving this one until it can at least invoke a couple of giggles from my toddler, if not genuine understanding."
3,It's just ok,"This wasn't all I had hoped it would be as far as a going to bed book was concerned. Firstly I hate that they are exercising after they've put their pyjamas on. How do you explain that one other than that it's silly?! We've been reading to our daughter since she was born, and she loves books, but this one never really grabbed her attention and she never chooses it of her own accord."
3,my book-loving toddler does not find this interesting,"i am not a big fan of Sandra Boynton's books. this is the only one we bought. my 2 year old daughter loves books, but she is not too interested in this one. she has asked me what some of the animals are, and i can't name them all as they are not well-drawn. she prefers Goodnight Moon and Big Red Barn as her bedtime books."
3,"Better for older kids who ""get"" the story and rhymes","Clever story and rhymes, but my 2-year old has never been interested in this book. We received it as a gift when he was born and it was one of my (Mom) personal favorites. But he has always strongly preferred books with photographs over illustrations, and he's not quite old enough to appreciate the story. Maybe he'll get into it later on."
5,We read it every night,My twin boys love this book. I lost the book and had to order a new one in a fast and hurry because they missed me reading this book. Great for every child under the age of 2!
5,My son's favorite bedtime story!,"I have a 2-year-old son and I got this book for him when he was about a year old. Since then we have read it every single night before going to bed and he never tires of it! It is a cute story about getting ready for bed, and as all of Sandra Boynton's books, it has a good sing-song type of rhythm which keeps younger children attentive. As my son has gotten older he has memorized the book, and while I can't get him to actually ""read"" the book to me, he finishes the sentences on every page and gets mad if I finish the sentence without letting him. We've had to start doing this with all of Boynton's books that he has memorized. He loves his Boynton books the most out of all of his books!"
4,Works well as a bedtime ritual,I read this book each night to my child and have found it very helpful as a before bedtime ritual to help my child fall asleep faster at night. Sometimes she gets a little tired now and asks me to read her book before bed.
5,LOVE LOVE LOVE this book,My little boy loves this book. We read it just about every night and he points to the pictures and squeels with delight. Even my 7yr old will sit down and read this book to him. We all have it memorized and we just love it!
5,A must read every night,We have read this book so many times I have it memorized. I have to recite it every night right before putting my daughter down for the night. It seems to help soothe her and she knows it's time to go to bed. The story is a little silly and doesn't make sense but I don't argue with what she likes.
4,Cute,Cute book. Pictures are colorful. My 17 month old son enjoys it. It's a good size for little toddler hands.
4,Even I have it memorized!,"I got this for my son over two years ago (now 3). I would read this very often even though he didn't know much about reading at few months old. It's one of his favorite books that I even have it memorized! I ""read"" it to him even without the book sometimes and he still likes to listen."
3,Silly and not in a good way,"I ordered this book for my 3 year old who still does not want to sleep in her own room. After reading the reviews, I was excited to read the book but was disappointed once I did. It wasn't my favorite. The book made no sense and was kind of all over the place. My daughter doesn't seem to enjoy it much. Shouldve gone with another book"
5,I wish I'd found this author sooner,"We gave this book to our son for his second birthday which was two days ago. He now has it memorized and is reciting it to me. He loves it because it follows a familiar routine: his bedtime ritual (except for the exercise, but he loves the silliness of that part). Even our three-and-a-half year old comes over when I read this. I also think the pictures really get his attention. Our two-year-old is even throwing in some motions (rocking, scrubbing) when I read it. I'm looking forward to Christmas when I can buy them some more of this author."
2,Order made no sense,I read this book as a child and later as a baby sitter. The order of the events that are done before going to bed makes no sense and I felt that way even as a child. Plus as an adult I know that all the running around is not conducive to sleeping. I could not enjoy this book no matter how many times I read it.
1,My daughter really dislikes this book,"My daughter is 18 months old and she hates this book. I know ""hate"" is a strong word, but she literally closes the book and throws it on the floor every time I open it. We usually read when I sit her down on a potty and my daughter loves this routine. Since I've bought the Going to Sleep book, which was maybe a month ago, she has never allowed me to finish reading it to her.She loves to read. Some of our favorite books are Goodnight, Gorilla, Little Blue Truck, I am a Bunny... I think the reason why she dislikes the Going to Bed book is because it is drawn so unrealistically and with too many lines and details. It is irritating to the eyes. To top that, it is about going to bed which is not a favorite activity on a any toddler's list. Sorry, but this book was just not for us."
2,"Dull pictures, boring characters","I got this book because it was rated so high. My daughter is 16 months old and she shows no interest in this book. The pictures and colors are dull. Nothing pops out at you. The story is ok, but I don't understand why the animals are exercising before bed??? There are better books out there like the Baby Einstein books. For an older child, maybe this book would be better."
5,Fantastic Book!,"I purchased this on a whim as Boynton has amazing reviews, and I was definitely not disappointed. My daughter absolutely adores this book. She is now 16 months old and brings this book to us without fail at night time. Boynton's books naturally have a sing song rhythm to them that is soothing for babies when they don't even understand the words you are saying. For the past nine months, my daughter has adored Boynton's books with this one in aprticular. Definitely worth it!"
4,Favorite Boynton Book,"The Going to Bed Book is my son's favorite book by Sandra Boynton. I received it at a baby shower before he was even born. I've been reading it to him aloud since he was a tiny infant. Now he's two, and we love to read it together.Besides fun illustrations and a cute, simple story, this book has great connections for babies and toddlers at ""going to bed time."" The animals take a bath, hang their towels on the wall, find pajamas big and small, brush their teeth, and then exercise! Tired out, they go back down the stairs, say good-night, somebody turns out the light, and they rock and rock and rock to sleep.The rhythm and pacing is perfect for getting ready for bed. My son has already taken his bath and brushed his teeth, so it's fun to see the animals do the same things as they get ready for bed. The book slows and ends with repetition, like the rhythmic rocking that we do in his glider as we read. It's a great winding-down book for the end of the day."
5,Sweet Story,"This was my family's introduction into Sandra Boynton's wonderful books. We have enjoyed it immensely and always look forward to reading it at bedtime. My four year old loved it when she was younger, and now my older twins get excited when I break it out at bedtime. It is such a treat!"
2,Not Really Worth It,"I rate this low because of problems with drivers from this company who rarely updates them. This is a niche item from a boutique company that doesn't really make a whole lot of differance in actual performance.My experience is it fails to outperform any other 1 Gig card, and I've had problems with drivers when transitioning from Windows XP to Windows 7. Plus, it throws off a lot of heat that your pc may not be able to handle."
2,Made no noticiable difference,I got this to hopefully improve my ping and FPS with WoW and Lord of the Rings Online. There was no noticeable difference vs. the integrated NIC on my motherboard (Gigabyte Nvidia 590 series). I have the most recently drivers for my mobo and I feel that is about the best you can do in that regard. Don't waste your money on one of these - save it for a better graphics card or CPU.
5,The New British Politics,The book is presented in five parts Part 1 reviews the social and historical context of British politics Part 11 explains the complexities of the govermental systems Part 111 & 1V explore the issues involved in citizens participation and part representation in the systems of gevernment Part V gives an overview of the methods adopted by society to control and contain its citizens Part V1 is concerned to illucidate the rational related to the construction of policy Part V11 summaries the new politics required as Britian develops closer links with Europe
5,The music set the atmosphere for the movie,"I always liked watching the movie. However I did not realize how much the soundtrack contributed until I realized it was available. Now you not only have the feel of the movie, but the soundtrack stands on its own for setting atmosphere!A little about the movie:Looks like an accident has happened at the North Pole (Ice station Zebra). The U.S. with Brittan, and the soviets are rushing to the rescue. Both are hampered by a snow storm. The U.S. has sent a submarine to the rescue. However it looks like something covert is afoot. The submarine is being packed with marines and an unscrupulous acting character. What is the secret? Will the sub even make it to the pole? And if so what will they find? Why are the soviets so keen in helping?"
4,Great for a local history,"A little dry at times, like many histories, but overall well researched and detailed. Great for any local Eastern NC history lovers!"
4,The Jewish Children's Bible: Genesis,"My kids (5-1/2 and 8-1/2) love this book. We are in a rural area with not many other Jewish children to share experiences with. This book is very readable, close enough to Book I, yet a little literary license to keep it entertaining and flowing for youngsters."
3,Werewolves,"The movie had an at the most entertaining plot, the werewolves were your typical bloodthirsty killers, but it still was a fun movie. I have to say the special effects were bad. If you like werewolves check our Ladyhawke, An American Werewolf in London, and the rest of The Howling series. END"
3,Quite an enjoyable horror/thriller.,"I'm a semi-fan of horror films, which means I like to watch them though I tend not to devote undying love to them. Werewolf films are a mixed bag for me so I was pleasantly surprised by The Howling. The film began VERY slowly, with nothing truly compelling occuring in the first half hour, but the movie's real suspense hits in around the 50-minute mark and holds you tight for the last 40 minutes, which are filled with suspense, chills, and some good werewolf action.I've heard comments around that this a partial comedy, yet with the exception of a few scenes near the end, I found little humor in it, which I found as a plus. It takes itself seriously, and it's tone is enhanced by some wonderful creature effects. The transformation scenes are still among the best ever and worth watching alone for these moments."
4,THE HOWLING,THE HOWLING is one of the best werewolf movies I've ever seen. The story is about a female TV news reporter who has a traumatic encounter with a rapist and after that she is sent to a group community retreat. Then she slowly begins to find out that almost every one at the retreat is a werewolf. The film has a bizarre story along with some amazing special effects.
3,Keep The Flea Powder Handy,"The Howling is a good but not great werewolf movie as it fails on any real suspense as a reporter uncovers what really lurks behind a doctor and his so-called colony.There are heaps of nods and winks to other horror films and the effects were ahead of there time in 1981.Sadly though the whole thing looks a bit tame now and it's quite boring at times, so fans will still love it but newbies will probably say ""so what's so good about this?""For fans only."
3,Enjoyable werewolf film.,"A news anchorwoman arrives at a peaceful backwoods resort only to discover there are werewolves in the midst. Mostly entertaining horror film suffers from a boring and monotonous opening half-hour, before firmly settling its niche with a suspenseful and scary second half. There are a few other flaws, mainly that Dee-Wallace Stone never develops her character fully and the werewolf effects aren't particularly great, but it's overall enjoyable and has a great setting to boot. Recommended, though I still slightly prefer Silver Bullet."
2,Wouldn't sit through it again...,"I bought this DVD at Wal-mart for under 5 bucks because it was a double feature with the movie Child's Play, which I love. This DVD also had a disk of special features. I had heard really great things about this movie, so I put it in before Child's Play. I didn't like it. I didn't feel any type of connection with any of the characters, and I found myself lokking forward to seeing them get attacked by the werewolves. That was, until the werewolves appeared on screen. There was some tense build up, the only reason I gave this movie 2 stars. The monsters themselves, hilarious in the worst of ways!! I literally couldn't stop laughing!! And the ending....OMG, that was the funniest thing about the movie. This movie was a joke to me, and one that wasn't funny enough to watch again."
2,Bay at the moon...or whenever,"Let's get this out of the way. I'm in love with the werewolf makeup and the adrenaline pumped attacks by the creatures...but notmuch else. This film disregards most of the werewolf mythos, like the pentagram in the hand of his victim and the lunar transformation. In this movie a werewolf changes whenever he takes a notion too. Not only is this stupid, but it damages the pathos we would have for the monster(remember Lon Chaney Jr.?).As to the beastly love-making..yeah. What is this, Anne Rice? For some reason, it worked in the 1992 Dracula but not here. Oh, I know..vampires are supposed to be romantic. There it is. For a far more faithful and consistent werewolf movie, check out ""An American Werewolf in London"" or kick it old school with Universal's ""The Wolf Man""."
4,The Best Werewolf Film...EVER!,"A city is under a reign of terror of a man only identified as Eddie. He is in contact with a TV anchorwoman, and after a terrifying encounter with him, she is advised to take a couple weeks off and go to a retreat that is run by the station's psychologist, Dr. George Waggner. Once there, she realizes the truth about Eddie Quist, and of the rest of the people that are staying at this retreat. This is far and away my favorite werewolf movie, even edging out ""An American Werewolf in London"", which is another classic. The design for the werewolves is the best I've seen. The special effects are awesome, and the acting is tremendous by the entire cast. I don't really know what else to say. If you are looking to watch one of the best horror movies made, or *the* best werewolf movie, go pick up The Howling."
3,Dee Wallace as a big... bad... poodle,"Okay, now this movie was okay. Didn't see many werewolves which is part of the reason I gave it three stars. The other reason... Dee Wallace looks like a cute little dog you would like to snuggle with rather than something you would fear. It was completely ridiculous. The other werewolves were freakin awesome. By far one of the best transformation scenes to date. Unfortunately, the first Howling is the only one worth watching. The other Howling's were just stupid and I couldn't watch the rest of half of them because they put me to sleep. The porn store scene was pretty good it left me on the edge of my seat, but didn't see much of anything. For the lack of the all the werewolves this movie did pretty good. But a werewolf movie is supposed to have just that, werewolves, and this didn't have enough."
3,early 80's werewolf movie..,"After a traumatic experience at work, TV news reporter Karen White (Dee Wallace) takes time away from work by checking into a resort at a California beach. She is to receive therapy there to try to recall in detail exactly what happened to her.While there, she soon discovers that she's in a colony of werewolves and that she and her husband and everyone there is in danger.The special effects are well done, considering they are 30 years old."
3,"Most scariest ""werewolf metamorphosis"" sfx ever !","At the time of writing, this DVD has yet to be available but i will definitely grab it as soon as it's out.Special effects wizard, Rob Bottin has created just about the most gruesome & realistic werewolf transformation scene ever filmed in movie history...you can bet on that!Even Rick Baker's effects from ' An American Werewolf In London 'couldn't match that of Rob Bottin's in this movie. Heck...Rob is the same guy who did those great slimy mutating visual effects of that shape-shifting alien from John Carpenter's ' the Thing '. What a guy!This movie is worth grabbing just for that werewolf transformation sequence ( complete with protruding snout, jaw, fangs, body hair, ripping skull...etc )itself .This is THE DEFINITE Werewolf movie for fans of the genre. Don't miss it !"
2,SORRY JOE DANTE!,Why must you direct such a boring mindless werewolf film? An American Werewolf in London was waaaay better. This movie was so boring I couldent believe it. So mind numbing and utterly pointless and the only thing that is worth anything is the nudity and special effects. Great effects really save this from total meltdown. I hated it.
2,Basic horror movie. READ THE BOOKS!!!,"Compared to the story of the book, the film version was VERY dissapointing.I read both HOWLING and HOWLING TWO in less than a week. I could not put them down. Skip the movie and read the books."
3,Nothing to howl about!,"Ok, this movie is good, but as far as horror movies go this doesn't seem like somthing worthy to add to my DVD collection.It gets points for being a werewolf movie and consideration for the breakthrough special effects of the 80s. However this movie isn't higher than three stars because from early in on the film I guessed what was going to happen, as I'm sure most people will. It was predictable enough. I'm not sure if this movie has just been ripped off over the years but I've seen this story line before, I'm sure most people are already familiar with the 'village of werewolves' plot.Another werewolf film I watched recently which I think is better than this would be ""Dog Soldiers"""
3,"In the mood for a ""funny/scary"" movie?","Definitley fodder for a bad movie party or a group of kids who want to watch a ""scary"" movie but want to be able to sleep afterward.There was nothing that really bothered me about the story although it was as predictable as can be. What really bothered me (and made me laugh until I fell off the couch) was the werewolf. Aside from the fact that it walked upright, which is a matter of taste for horror fans, the giant bunny-rabbit ears were absolutely ridiculous!"
4,"Hee, hee,","Joe Dante kills me. I should have expected a little bit of silliness from the maker of ""Gremlins"". While not all that scary coming off your TV screen, I could imagine a few frights in the theatre. Worth it for the complete, almost five minutes long transformation of man to werewolf, the numerous in joke props (""Wolf Chili"", the appearance of ""Howl"" by Ginsberg on someones desk) and the full frontal of Angelina Jolie lookalike Elisabeth Brooks. It was better than Carrie."
1,Waste of Money,"I should have remembered why I didn't go to see this ""movie"" in the first place. Bad acting, direction, screenplay, you name it and it was bad. Sorry I spent the money. Had I been able to rate this -**** I would have. Don't waste you time or money on this one."
1,THE HOWLING: SICK & FREAKY,I've seen the Howling. It stunck. It made no sense. I didn't understand the parts about the naked ape women in the middle of the film. There seems to be multtiple werewolves. There was a news reporter orsomething. The werewolves were freaky. I don't understand why they made sequals. The movie was bad don't buy it.This Reveiw was posted by the Hammer Film Reveiwer.
3,Damn werewolf slobber!,"At first I didn't give this movie a chance.""It'll never best Lon Chaney Jr.'s Wolf Man."" I grunted. But I'm glad I finally did watch this. It's a very intelligent horror film. Good special effects and the Were wolf twist story works impressively well. The movie also pays homage and respect to the timeless Universal Classics that obviously inspired it. It's a good scare'em up and I'm glad I have it in my collection."
4,Awesome big bad wolf!!!,"As an horror flicks fan I have to say this is not a movie for everyone, but If you're on the full moon mood, this one's for you, It can be considered an 80's werewolf classic beside american werewolf in london and wolfen (recently dog soldiers can be added to this trilogy), the big bad wolf scene is really amazing, (we don't need computer generated images all time), the only complaint about the DVD it's the lack of extra features, it would be nice to see a special edition with some xtra stuff"
4,used book,Amazon should make it very clear these are used and charge accordingly. I could have gotten new one for. I don't care to see someone else's highlighting.
1,Very Simple,Don't trust obese people who write books about fat loss. Enough said. He is ignorant of what it really takes to lose weight and his no-amylose diet is a hoax.
5,Stunning...,"The first Gregorian Album i bought. Fromt he first track ""Moment of Peace"" i fell in love with it. It is so ""atmospheric"" listening to it in the dead of night transports you to a Church, a feeling of being surrounded by Holistic sounds.Babylon is also good, givign an eerie sense o the song.Overall a good album to listen to. It spurred me to buy the other albums as well. =)"
2,Not As Advertised,"This would be a great item if it weren't for a couple of things:A) In order to fit 360 discs in here, you sacrifice the disc itself. The way the slots are configured (there are top and bottom slots on each page) scratches the hell out of discs unless you're using it for 180.B) If you are using it for 360 discs, and can get past the fact that it'll scar your discs for life--the top slots completely cover the disc and make it impossible to know what it is without pulling it out.I am very unhappy with this and they should make it known on the product page that it isn't ideal for 360 discs. It's a variation of false advertising. Something this pricey with credentials so bloated should be the picture of excellence.Needless to say, I'm sending mine back ASAP!"
4,This case is sooo nice.,This is the best cd/dvd holder I have seen and I have been looking at so many different kinds and brands of cd/dvd holders for months at all kinds of different stores. It was delivered quickly three days after ordering. Shipping from this company ANTOnline was quite expensive. But the price of the case was the lowest I have found anywhere on the net so it all evened out and I had to have a good case. Because I carry the case all over the house and back yard. It is so well constructed all sewn. It's not real suede but the material is nice. Each pocket is divided into two sections the front pocket has a clear cover to put the cd label in and the back pocket is for the cd which is so cushy and soft but I have so many cd's I just put the same artist cd's in both sections so it will hold the total number in my case 360. I'm going to order another one for my DvD's.
4,Sleek sturdy case.,I love this case. It is sturdy nice looking and easy to use. I like how wide the pages are. I use this for my son's DVD's and it is easy for him to see all his movies.The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the 360 capacity is a little misleading. It's true you can fit that many but only half that number is visible. I realize that someone who uses this as an album holder for CD's and puts the cover album in the front slot and the actual CD behind would find this perfect. Except it still would only hold half the capacity as well. I do not use the back slot which isn't visible since I need to see all the DVD's at a glance. I wish they would make a case specifically for DVD's that didn't waste any slots.
2,180 CDs not 360,Here is the title of the product: Slappa SL-36001 360 CD Hardbody Case.This case only holds 180 if you are storing the covers as well.I have no idea what they mean by 360. Am I suppose to put to totally unrelated CDs in the same sleeve? Misleading and way to expensive. This is the most disappointing product I have ever purchased from Amazon.
1,EXTREMELY UNHAPPY,It has been almost a year and I have not received the 2nd of the 2 slappa's I ordered. Nor have I received a refrund from Shopilla.
3,"if ,you have only few notion of the market ,after read it","YOU stay as same way,give you idea from various techniques,but detail of the techniques,need buy another books"
5,Great little tie down,"These straps are great. I have had them for a year and have no problems. They are long enough to go around and through the car (windows down) if you don't have the right attachment sights on your roof rack for what you want to carry. I have used them for long and short hauls and nothing moves... including a canoe strapped to a car without any roof rack, just the foam pads from REI."
2,Don't know how to put together,"I know these are strong and all, but I haven't been able to use them. The instructions weren't drawn well, so I feel like monkey trying to ""put a square in a circle"" during assembly. Perhaps, after some searching on the web, looking at some clear photos, and I'll be good to go..."
1,Not Good,"I took mine out west on a trip and the battery life was about 15 minutes (fully charged). I ran it off the power adapter and could not get through a full movie.If your DVD/CD's have ANY imperfections this player won't play them. I finally got a brand new audio cd to play straight from the package, although it still skipped whenever you walked through the room.Not recommended."
1,Stay Away,"I just want to warn you about this companies equipment. They don't stand behind it at all. So far I have owned 2 of their prodects and neither one has lasted 1 year. Unfortunately, their warentee is for 90 days. This Portable DVD players battery never worked (I brought 3 of them back before I got one that worked and that one stopped working after 40 days...and the batteries only warenteed for 30 days). This company does not stand behind their products and their customer service...well I guess they call it that...is useless. Trust me...don't buy anything from them. Save your money!!!"
4,"A Compact, Well-Written Scientific Thriller","Unlike the malevolent invisible man of H.G. Wells, Dirck Bredlinger's protagonist falls innocent victim to a research project gone awry. By contrast to The Invisible Man of a much earlier time, An Insubstantial Man is a credible 21st Century science fiction novel filled with two classic modern sources of greed and corruption--industrial espionage and international intrigue. This work is escapist literature with a basis in reality.-Emily K. Lawson"
3,good ink,"no comment, once has a fountain pen, you need ink to write. the ink's quality is not bad, it is ok !"
4,A fun read,"The book is great for those who want to take a glimpse at the ""behind the scenes"" stuff. It offers commentary, photos and notes. I found it interesting in how original scripts were editted to fit the show's timeline.Though, ""Wormhole Extreme"" was a milestone eposide, it was not my favorite on screen. However the script presented nuiances I missed - leading me to appreciate this eposide a little more."
3,Why so expensive?,"I am getting ready to order my refill kit, and wonder why I can order off the Earthbox website for less than $10 vs this for $25?"
5,Awesome!,"I can't wait to start growing my tomatoes... this product gives us bigger, better and many more tomatoes than anything else! Incredible!"
4,Came with 7-7-7 fertilizer not 6-8-10,"The kits I received did not have the 6-8-10 fertilizer as advertised in the description. Instead they had the standard 7-7-7 fertilizer. I ordered this because the 6-8-10 might be better for vegetables than the 7-7-7. I decided to keep what I got because I don't believe the 6-8-10 is available anymore anyway.Yes you can get fertilizer and dolomite more cheaply, but the Earthbox system is all about kits and simplicity, which I like. This kit is all you need to replant your EB."
3,Where's the storage bag?,"The product is great, actually. But I emailed the manufacturer right after we got it. The box clearly states that a storage bag is included, but it's not. They never replied to my email, so I'm giving it three stars. Would be higher, even if they replied without complete satisfaction, but no reply is just plain lame."
4,Another great Anne Perry Book,"Anne Perry mixes controversial issues of Victorian Times and today in her novels. The issue this time is censorship and pornography. Inspector Pitt is forced to solve a murder without Charlotte this time, and although she is missed, the novel is as entertaining as ever. We get a closer look at Charlotte's mother Caroline and her husband and their world of theater. All in all I would recommend this one as much as all the others."
2,moonless,"This book was a painful read.Ms Perry's attempt to answer her readers' demand for an in-depth approndissement of character development was less than seamless.It is commendable that her strong sense of plot and logical,if surprising denouements,rivet the reader.However, her development as a mistress of suspense should always be a the forefront of her creations.As a major writer,her intelligence should dominate."
3,An OK read for Perry fans.,"I have read every one of Perry's mysteries, and was extremely disappointed in the previous two. Half-Moon Street is OK, but it lacks the punch of Perry's best work, and a plot twist at the end doesn't actually make too much sense.The bottom line: I just wasn't too interested in this mystery, and since Perry's stories ALWAYS have a modern-day moral, it's pretty easy to see the resolution coming."
4,A changing world...,"Excellent entry in the Thomas and Charlotte Pitt series, with Pitt trying to solve the mystery of a man found dead and drifting in a punt on the Thames River. Pitt is more on his own in this book, and Charlotte does not figure as prominently as before, but I did not see that as a drawback. Pitt's investigations take him to the bohemian parts of London, to the world of the theater. Pitt's search for the truth, along with help from Charlotte, shows us how the world is changing, from the Victorian to the modern."
5,The issues don't change; only the players do,"It is particuarly interesting to read this book as the US political conventions get started.First, though, I must admit to being a Perry fan from way back. In Half Moon Street Perry wraps her murder mystery around issues of censorship, women's rights, and what generally are understood as liberal vs. conservative opinions. It is interesting to step back from today and view these issues from a Victorian perspective. While Perry seems to try being evenhanded, I think her stand is clear. One of Perry""s strong suits in all her books is her exposition of contemporary issues from a historical background.Once again she is a master of intriguing plot and well developed characters. A great book to read during a thunderstorm, when political conventions get boring, or both."
2,Definitely not one of Anne Perry's best works!,"I was really disappointed with this book. Perry seems to have departed from her traditional focus on plot and motive here and chosen to focus on her own agenda of advancing the feminist cause. This is good in small doses, but not to an extent where it diverts from the ""detecting"" process. I hope that Perry will revert to her previous inclinations when writing the next Thomas/Charlotte Pitt book."
5,Great Series!,"I love this series by Anne Perry, and I can hardly wait to finish one and start another. She definitely knows how to weave a story and how to make you care about the characters."
2,Missed the bus on Half Moon Street,"I have enjoyed every one of Anne Perry's mysteries, both the Pitt and Monk series, until this one. I was sorely disappointed with the story line. It was weak and predictable. The women's rights thread was interesting and fitting, but the actual mystery was sparse. Not the usual intricately woven tale I'm accustomed to from Ms. Perry. I almost had the sense that the book was written to meet a publishing schedule rather than the natural continuation of a very interesting and entertaining series. Very often I'll think I know who the guilty party is only to find myself, as a result of a unexpected plot twist, to be mistaken in the end. I was disappointed to find out I was right this time. I would much prefer to have to wait longer for the next book to come out and have it be up to her usual standards than to repeat this experience again."
2,Page Skipper,"I had the stack maintainance staff in our library search for 2 days to find this book for me and I wish I had not bothered. I used to enjoy the Thomas and Charlotte Pitt mysteries, but not this one. I found myself running into the soapbox obstacles constantly and skipping the pages trying to find the resumption of the mystery story. I missed the interplay between Thomas and Charlotte and I missed the mystery."
1,Where was Charlotte?,"As a fan of Anne Perry's Thomas and Charlotte Pitt series, I was greatly dissapointed by this book.Firstly, the murder plot was boring and obvious and the mistaken identity ""twist"" was nonsensical.Secondly, the absence of Charlotte Pitt was much missed. She was vacationing in Paris with her sister Emily in this installment. Charlotte is usually a central character in the books and without her this novel fell flat.Thirdly, the focus on Thomas' mother in law and grandmother in law was too much. They are usually perimiter characters and they did not mesh with what we had learned about them in previous books.Overall, the character format of this novel was not as enjoyable as Ms. Perry's other books from this series.Come back Charlotte!!!"
3,"Don't ask, don't tell","This novel is set in London in 1891, with particular emphasis on the theatres and the arts. It relates to a time period when women could be held in virtual slavery by their husbands. It deals with a variety of issues including women's rights, pornography, and perversions. It is more a romance novel than a mystery. While the novel has interesting sub-plots, perhaps it contains too many to be a good novel. The author also seems to be on a soap box, and perhaps does a little too much name dropping...Inspector Pitt and Sergeant Tellman find themselves investigating sleazy shops that sell pornographic photos under-the-counter, sometimes to teenage boys - photos that sometimes depict acts that are illegal. The investigation eventually leads to a solution of the case. The novel deals with the seamier side of people's lives. It has content unsuitable for children. Parental discretion is advised."
2,What was the mystery here?,"This was my first Anne Perry mystery and unless something else by her is more interesting, she is going on my don't read list. What was the real story/mystery here? It seemed like half of the book revolved around Caroline and Joshua and their marraige. I saw only a minor connection of this story with the murder of the photographer. Are Caroline and Joshua really supposed to be the central characters or is it Pitt and the murder. While I do applaud the author for tackling the tough subject of censorship and the right for women to divorce thier husbands, I can not in good conscience give this book any better than two stars, it just didn't flow or come together."
1,More of the Same,"I have vowed that I would never read another Anne Perry mystery again. Then in a moment of weakness and in the absence of anything more appealing, I bought and read Half Moon Street. And it was more of the same tired, worn-out explication of Victorian mores, discussed inthe same dreamy, wordy, uninteresting way that one expects from this author. While billed as a mystery novel, the mystery part takes up no more than 10% of the book. Next time I really will know better."
5,Surprise Surprise!,"A refreshing change from the usual obvious and bland Christian music, this CD has an overwhelming sense of sincerity and depth seldom found in Christian music. Intelligent and inspirational lyrics combined with obvious musical gifting makes a very satisfying listen over and over."
3,"Great for secondary infertility, not as great for primary","This book is charmingly written, but it is definitely about secondary infertility. The author conceived her first child effortlessly, and naturally includes her daughter in the book and is very conscious that she, as she puts it, is ""going back for seconds."" While it is inspiring on some level, if you are suffering from primary infertility, it is a little more difficult to sympathize when she does sound like she's already been extremely blessed. If you aren't too sensitive about reading about her child, you will enjoy this book."
5,This book is a must for anyone dealing with infertility.,"As a homeopathic practitioner, I recommend this book during my first contact with anyone dealing with the issue of infertility. Julia Indichova's warm and straightforward account of her own quest to have a child can bolster the spirits of any woman faced with trying to conceive. I've had my clients tell me that they read the book over and over. I think that's because it's like listening to a kindly and heartfelt voice of wisdom when you are at your wits end. There are many other infertility books available for hard core medical information, but this one is in a wonderful and spirit-filled class by itself. The cover picture tells you a lot about the spark you'll find within the pages. Whether you're dealing with primary or secondary infertility, this book will give you hope and a sense that you are surrounded by other women fighting the same battle."
3,"too little, too late","I bought this book hoping to learn more about how one woman ""beat"" the fertility game. A happy ending, but I was disappointed in the brief chapters, the lack of attention to detail in the author's descriptions of her self-discovery and healing. I wanted more of a model and a guide to someone else's success, but instead the book provides too many choppy little anecdotes of her experiences with New Age healers, bland clinicians and eastern spiritualists. Indichova is still, at the end, someone who hops desperately from one new and exotic treatment to another. I still don't know which exactly ""worked"" for her, although she definitely gives a thumbs down to the western medical establishment for treating fertility disorders."
1,No magic cure,Please don't think that merely reading this book and following the steps the author took will enable you to become pregnant. There are no magic cures here. The pain of infertility can make you vulnerable to any potential solution. I just don't want others to be disappointed.
2,It is a good novel,"The book was interesting in that it told a woman's story and how she successfully won the battle of infertility. However, if someone is looking to this book as a guideline they will be disappointed. This is not a how-to book."
5,A real pick-me-up!,"I didn't really know what to expect but after reading the first few pages I could see myself following this same path of spending time and money on a wild goose chase. Luckily I kept reading - this book totally inspired me to take charge of my body and my health but most of all not to get bullied into procedures that don't feel right. I don't have any children (yet)and I have a high FSH but I am now much calmer and much more confident that I can help myself, regardless of the initially shocking ""IVF is your only choice"" response of the consultant. If you need something to relieve stress and inspire you, this book really did it for me and I hope will do it for you!"
3,Will inspire you not to give up on getting pregnant.,"This book is great if you need an inspiration not to give up trying to get pregnant. Julia's determination is to be admired. The book is written in story form which is fine if you were just looking for a good book to go to bed with at night but most women are desperately looking for specific details on ""how to get pregnant"". It would have been more helpful if she had been more specific and dedicated a chapter alone on everything she used to get pregnant and how much. You have to search through the book for details (and they're not very detailed). I think the book would be more beneficial written a little more scientific (meaning more specific details) and a little less like a good story."
4,Comparison,"I am an avid fan of Gerald Seymour, anxiously awaiting the paperback version of ""Holding The Zero"". I thoroughly enjoyed The Waiting Time and was pleased when I found a new title via internet called Dead Ground.Unfortunately however ""The Waiting Time"" & ""Dead Ground"" are one and the same book - only the titles are different. Very confusing and expensive."
3,Good.,Not an amazing book but it does give you some ideas for how to celebrate each of the summer sabbats.
4,Great Overview,"Great Introduction of the Wiccan/pagan sabbats from Beltane to Mabon which would include, Mabon, Ostara, Summer solstice, Lammas and Mabon. (roughly Spring, summer and autumn) you will have to get its companion book Celebrating the seasons of life.. Samhein to Candlemas to complete the series. It is a good introduction for those of you wondering what a Sabbat is. or for those who feel the Primevil urges calling and wish to explore further. There are alot of better books out there, but theres alot worse ones as well."
2,Huh?,Wow. I was excited to read these books and they were both beyond disappointing. I'm guessing it makes sense to the authors inner circle and that's about it. Returned the books.
3,"Great shave & price, FOIL STINKS...",The price and shave it great but the foil is brittle and dosen't last. This is where BRAUN makes up its money...the replacement foil has to be replaced about every 6-8 weeks of daily shaving (...)
1,Braun not very good,I bought this shaver for my son at Macy's on sale for 58.00It doesnt work very well and we will return it. I tried it also and it doesnt shave close at all . I will buy him a new Norelco like he had before.
2,Not Braun like,"Braun is known for the innovation, technology, and design of its product. I read an article years ago that told a story of how Braun engineers tried to perfect every one of its products, one big honcho said ""if it's a Braun, it must meet all of our standards"". Well, those standards must have changed over the years. I bought this as an emergency replacement while I'm getting my 6525 fixed, what a difference. It looks and feels flimsy, and it is noisy when you turn it on. It doesn't shave close, and the spring-loaded floating cutter is almost totally useless.So save yourself some aggravation, don't buy it."
5,Cake Top!,Exquisite! It was the highlight of the reception. I recommmand it to anyone who has a flair or want to incorporate a bit of an Irish taste to their special day. Thanks weddingstar!
4,Four stars only 'cause of duplicate tracks,"You know, with the exception of the Makaveli album, the R U Still Down album, and the greatest hits album, this is how an album of remixed material should sound. Like others have stated, the rock remix of Hail Mary is raw, straight raw, every song on here is raw, the one drawback is having Picture Me Rollin' twice, but other than that, the How Do U Want It remix is, I think better than the original, I just wish Kci and Jojo were still on it. But I like the new beat, and the video version of the lyrics. What'z Ya Phone # sounds better than the original, Keep Going with Fatal...Pac is so sick on that track, I've never heard him spit like that, I had to play it twice before checking out the rest of the cd.In closing, if you're a Pac fan and dissapointed with the last couple of albums (Eminem 75 percent of your producton sucked...straight up, take a lesson here from people who know what they're doing), then you definately need to grab this."
1,another disgrace to pac,afeni once again continuwes to remix her son's classic songs by updating previous and unreleaesed material again I will not buy this crap I refuse to buy anything released by 2pac that was remixed and corrupted after his untimely demise quit whitewashing pac's music afeni.
4,Superbia,"This CD is such a fabulous listening experience. Highlights are the beautiful ""Whips of Mercy,"" the unique ""Song for Nico,"" and the heartwrenching ""Motorcycles."" It is deeply cathartic, and I love it. I am going to buy their latest CD, Phoenix. Hopefully i will see them in concert one day."
4,These guys ...,are awesome. I have heard that their live performance will not disappoint. The music grows on you with every listen. BUY THIS CD!!
1,Don't buy it!!!,"I bought two of these not knowing that if you fill them completely they will bust the bindings. And, I didn't even do all that much traveling with it. Just back and forth from home to dorm each semester. If you know that you are not going to fill it, this case would be okay, but if you have a ton of CD's like me, go for the Case Logic Brand binders."
1,buy this if you like to be miserable,"After less than one year of owning this binder, which I had filled to capacity, the binding broke. Shortly after, the carrying strap broke. I've noticed my discs getting more scratched during the past year than I'd noticed with other cd binders. I've still had this thing for almost two years and I don't know why. Getting cd's in and out is really difficult and I seriously feel like it is damaging my discs. I'm treating myself to a new binder tomorrow. I've noticed CaseLogic getting good reviews."
5,inspiring!,"My 2.0 y.r. daughter really enjoyed this book. True story based on Amelia Erhart and Eleanor Roosevelt - inspiring! Also, Eleanor Roosevelt is drawn accurately- i.e: not fabulously gorgeous- showing that beauty is not important in achieving success and happiness"
5,Learn history the fun way,"What a great way to learn about two historical icons! This is a wonderful book written about two great American women. Both Amelia and Eleanor are fabulous role models all on their own, but team them up and the inspiration they dole out is double the fun! Read this to your daughters, read this to your sons. Whatever you do, just read it."
4,Dreams Come True,"This is a cute historical novel for young children, although be warned that it is not completely accurate. The end of the book gives the true story at a higher reading level than the book. The illustrations are fun and entertaining. I especially liked that the illustrator used black and white to stay true to the time period."
4,Best Friends and Amazing People,"Before I read this book, I didn't know much about either of these women. I also couldn't see how you could compare them. But after reading it I realized that these women are indeed alike. They both love to be different, and to do out-of-the-ordinary things. The book has them going on 2 adventures together, each doing the things they love. During these adventures they wear their evening dresses. It is a great story about two amazing women."
4,My 9 month old enjoys,"We received this as hand-me-down and our son really likes it. There is a bit of variety to it (switching from the music to the learning) and he loves the colors and things that pop-up. The hammer is enjoyable by itself, but I can see another reviewers point about it being used to 'hammer' lots of things! I do wish the volume control had an even softer setting- they just don't need to be that loud, but it's not as bad as some."
1,Not much to do,"We received this toy as a gift. This toy functions as it is supposed to for us. It seems fairly sturdy but, . . .There isn't that much to do with this toy. Just a hammer with some shapes to hit and push, they don't move very much, the faces pop up and play sounds or songs. A ""measuring tape"" to pull. The hammer itself was too large for my son's grip at the age when he was interested in toys this simple. Not a toy that will last more than a few hours with an inquiring baby."
2,"Cute idea, but kind of boring","This toy is really cute, but failed to live up to expectations.I find the songs catchy and enjoy them, and my son loves it when I sing along for him. He pulls this off of his shelf and plays with it for a couple of minutes, but he doesn't want to play with it very often and I don't think he'll still be interested in it six months from now."
5,Growing with our child,"Our son has actually had this toy since age three months. It fascinated him in the store and we used to press it to keep his attention on the changing table. Through many stages, he can finally actually use it at 11 months as it was intended (though his hammer is his favorite). He has slammed it on the floor, and done endless things to make me conclude this toy is invinsible. I would suggest buying it for a younger child who can grow into it. I wouldn't necessarily find it that stimulating for a three year old."
4,My kid likes it. I don't really like it.,"This thing has the most annoying voice ever. I don't mind noise one bit from my child and his toys but this lady on here ... I want to ring her neck. Very nasal and high pitched and such an over actor! AAAACK!Educational... it's okay. It taught my baby cause and effect. The lights send him in to a fit though. After about 10 minutes of play I have to take it away cause he starts crying.I love the optional modes, one is learning mode, the other is music mode. I love the songs side. The hammer has a tiny rattle in it that stimulates the ears so my infant bangs everything with it now.We could really have done without this toy. We received it as a gift so it wasn't a waste for us. When the batteries die, I will not be replacing them."
3,Not too much to do with it,"I like the songs the toolbox plays, and the pop-up figures are kind of cute, but there's just not enough to do with this toy. It doesn't really play like tools, which is what I was looking for. It's just basically another singing toy, with not much resemblance to a toolbox. Next time I'll get something more that my son can hammer, use a play wrench, screwdriver, etc. like the good old wooden toy toolbenches."
4,fun toy,my nephew just love pounding the hammer on to the buttons on this toy. music is a little loud but it is very entertaining overall. it keeps my nephew's attention for quite some time!
4,Funny but a bit annoying,My son received this as a gift the day after he was born. It sat in the toy box until he was about 8 momnths old. Now he adores this toy. He loves the songs and the lights. He can even make it work by himself. My 3 year old daughter also thinks it's fun and likes to sing along with it. The only draw back is that I find the sound affects a little shrill (especially the little mole that says yippy). Overall it's a nice toy.
2,Does not hold attention!,My son received this for his first birthday. He is now 18 months and NEVER plays with this toy for more than a few seconds. Big waste of money.
5,Cute entertainment,This is a well-made toy for babies 6 months and up. It is fun to hit and listen to the songs and rhymes.
1,Very Disappointed,"If my child learned from this toy, he'd be missing out on half the alphabet! The toy is so cute, but only goes up to the letter P in the alphabet, then starts over. Personally, we think the entire alphabet is pretty important. Sadly, we had to return it."
3,Save your money,"My child had fun with this toy for about 10 minutes and then lost interest. Popping the tools with the hammer is fun for a minute, but there is really nothing to keep a child's interest after they touch every part of the toy a couple times. There aren't many songs or parts of the toy to keep a child entertained past the initial introduction of the toy. As far as learning, there are other toys that teach the same colors, words, and the alphabet that can also hold a child's interest. It just takes up room in our toybox :)."
3,Not All That Great,"I bought this toy for my son and it really isn't that great. It does play some songs, but it is easily boring. There isn't much to do with it. You hit the nails and move the measuring tape that only plays two songs. Its an okay toy, but it really isn't even that educational. It does sing the alphabet and count to ten, but i've seen more interesting toys."
3,Cyndie from Maine,"Over all, I was not impressed with this toy. My grandson, age 9 months, does not play with it much. The hammer is too heavy."
1,"Not a bad toy, but this is a scam.","This is a descent toy, our one year old has it and loves playing with it. However the seller is running a scam, this and most of the other toys they are selling are list at 4x the retail price and easily available at many retailers or other online vendors."
2,Not that interesting,"I originally had the FP Laugh and Learn Birdbath for my 8 mo old. She loved it. She loved the songs, the shapes and the birds. It broke after about 2 weeks though. So I exchanged it for this, because the price was equal in value, it was also a ""laugh and learn"" toy, and they didn't have the birdbath anymore.But....The songs on this are horrible. She isn't interested in it at all. The songs don't get her attention, the only thing that does get her attention is when it lights up. But, that's to be expected. She used to sit and play with the birdbath for about 5-10 minutes. This won't hold her attention for one minute.I'm taking this one back too."
2,My Son Does Not Like It At All :-(,I thought this would be a great toy for my 17 month old when we were in the store he cried to have it when we got home he cried when I sat down with him to play with it I was upset when I found out it only says A-L it could have at least said the whole ABC's and to me that is a heavy toy to carry around and the age on it is 6-36 months the hammer is heavy my son hit his hand and was in tears to me it should have been around $7.99 and maybe even cheaper I am very upset I spent $19.99 for it I wasted my money.
2,Annoying music,"We bought this for our seven month old. She is a little young for the hammer part, but loves to push the buttons. The music is annoying, so we keep that turned off. The other problem I have is that the buttons push down close to the back of the tool bench. Her little fingers have gotten caught between the button and the bench (which leads to a bit of screaming) I would not recommend this toy because of that for younger children."
2,Music is fun but entire toy is not that interesting to child,I got this for our daughter when she was six months old. I gave her a few toys and she seemed more interested in this one at the store so I bought this one. She is now one year and this toy has gotten little play. She had chewed on the hammer but never played with the toy by herself. The only time it is used is when I or her dad are playing with it while she watches. The upside is that the sounds and songs it plays are fun and bright. I would not recommend this toy.
2,Broken After Seven Days....,"My son, now thirteen months, loves this toy. He carries it around and brings it to us to play with him. It seems that banging on the shapes with the hammer helps his motor skills and hand eye coordination. Unfortunately, after only SEVEN days it was already broken. Nothing extrordinary happened to it, he didn't stand on it or drop it on a hard surface - just from normal play, one of the pop-up people just came out. There appears to be no way to put it back in and have it function like it originally did as pieces came off inside as well. We own a lot of Fisher Price toys and this was really disappointing."
2,Why does the alphabet end with P???,"HAHAHA okay- I originally wrote a long time ago that I couldnt figure out why this toy stopped singing at the letter P. So I would never buy it. Well someone bought this toy for my child and low and behold, when you take the thing off DEMO mode it works just fine.So although it wont let me change my star rating- I am able to change my written review.Here goes- its cute and somewhat entertaining but doesnt hold my childs interest any more than anything else. Even singing the entire alphabet song."
4,"Not a bad toy, a bit boring","We got his for our baby and she likes it. It doesnt hold her attention for long, there ae not too many tricks in this bag. I think its better for younger kids 5months-9 months. Afterwards it not too good."
2,Boring!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,In one word BORING. My son is 16 months old and shows not the least bit of interest in this toy and I can see why. When I clean out his toy chest this one will be the first to go. My son played with it a handful of times and he was not at all entertained by it. Skip this one there is better out there.
5,A soldier's Memories,"The collection of poetry is, in Lord Wavell's words, every poem he remembered. All are written down as they come to his memory. The title, of course, is from Montaigne's essays-""These are other men's flowers, only the string that binds them is mine own."" He commanded the British armies in the Middle East during World War II, and presumably jotted his memories down between battles. I believe it was published during that war, because I carried a copy with me in the Royal Air Force. Or did I? That may be a rear screen projection of events-my memory cannot in any way equal Archibald, Lord Wavell. The last quarter of the book comprises scraps of poems half remembered, but worthy of inclusion. I lost my copy a long time ago, so this is a memory of memories"
5,Best English poetry,"At 38yo now, I first found this as a paperback in my mother's books 20 years ago. It is now very definitely mine, I've kept it with permission. An army man, Lord Wavell proudly feels spiritual all the way through the anthology in his comments and editing. The content is the most surprising, consolidated & ""popular with reasons"" I've ever seen. All the classics are here, most of which Wavell could recite from memory. Everything: The owl & the pussycat get drunk on a dull opiate near a pleasuredome while keeping their heads when all around are losing theirs. Donne isn't in it but that's the only omission in the fun of reading it. Vast, diverse and often very funny, certainly beautiful."
1,These are waaay overpriced,Received my order today. Thought I had purchased several packages of the napkins and in fact had ordered only one. Learned the hard way that this is about $5. overpriced. The same item is available from the same vendor for $2.00 less than what I paid for it 2 days ago!?
2,I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED...,"LISETTE MELENDEZ HAS ALWAYS BEEN ONE OF MY FAVOITE FREESTYLE ARTISTS BUT I WAS DISAPPOINTED WHEN I HEARD THIS CD. THE ONLY SONG I FOUND TO BE THE BEST WAS ""TIME PASSES BY"". HOPEFULLY HER NEXT ALBUM WILL BE BETTER"
1,...wow...,"Rarley do you find such a piece of... work.Connie doesn't know what 'Nobility' means. She seems to indicate through her meandering (disjointed, poorly worded, confused) diatribes that she believes that 'Nobility' is the the ability to say to others 'I'm healthy... really... and if you don't believe me, you're probably evil/insane/wrong.'As a Christian, I am offended at her quasi-assertional falsisms (I don't know what else to call them). I feel dirty from her religious claims and viewpoint.The woman needs serious professional help from a good, secular (non-theological) psychologist."
4,"If you love Gary Numan and Punk Rock, you will love The Dragonflies.","A well known Northwest act that sold out clubs for years, The Dragonflies were a band that created an unusually unique sound that was punctuated by nearly flawless live performances. The unit was driven by the song writing of Michael Ormando and featured an instrumental sound that borrowed influences from Gary Numan, new wave, punk rock, and space rock. If you like Jimmy Eat World or Good Charlotte, chances are you will find something you like about The Dragonflies.They may sound familiar to you, their hit single ""Critical Nature"" was featured on the Sugar and Spice Film Soundtrack and their ""Brenda Mars"" was played relentlessly on Pioneer stereo commercials for most of 2002."
5,Awesome Comfy Puma Sneakers,"These sneakers are among the best I have ever had. You should buy them because they are wonderfully comfy, fairly cheap for Pumas and adorably cute to wear."
3,Regular...,It's a rather simple table. Actually if you can invest in something more expensive better make the effort to comparlo. Table functionally serves aesthetic level but lacks a bit.
4,Very good CD!!!,"Juan Carlos es un buen cantante de musica latino americana y venezolana. En este CD el ofrece una re-edicion de su primera produccion discografica, producida por Victor Mendoza (creador de Magia Blanca y fundador de el Trio Venezuela). Muy buenos musicos en esta produccion. El repertorio pudo sido mejor para sacarle mas provecho a las virtudes de la voz de Juan Carlos"
4,"Attractive, Impressive",I am satisfied as the crystal arrived in perfect condition and is large and impressive on its simple brass stand
5,top rated customer service,"Less than a day after ordering this crystal ball I discovered that they offered a quartz crystal ball 8 inches in Diameter, which met my needs more than the 150 mm size. I cancelled the order on a weekend and crossed my fingers.Kevin immediately responded and took care everything Monday morning. Great service and on a weekend, who knew!I was never left hanging.I highly recommend Kevin and his company."
3,bigger then expected,overall very nice but bigger then i expected and the packaging left a mess all over to cleanup i suggest using bubble wrap not what ever you can find
4,awesome for halloween gypsy prop,I needed a crystal ball for a halloween prop and this was just right! It is very heavy and looks great as a fortune tellers ball.
3,M-audio pod casting,"This is a good value start up product that is simple to use for the beginner, the microphone is decent and it is just a matter of connecting it all and recording ."
4,Great Starter Set Up,"If your just starting off in the pod cast arena, this is an excellent place to start! Value, simple to set up, and one great sounding mic. The stand leaves a bit to be desired, but over all, very happy."
5,You are buying this for the hardware,"The hardware in this kit is top notch; the microphone alone is worth almost as much as the entire package. The USB interface is also excellent, as it brings manual controls to you instead of having to mess around with settings on your PC.The software is pretty basic, but most of it is already a little outdated. If you want to mess around with your first steps in podcasting, then you really can't go wrong with this setup."
2,good quality of record sound,"Pros:Easy to install, good quality of record result.Cons:Can't adjust 16K bit or 24K bit from the driver. So I don't know it really does 24k or not.Tech support has no help at all and not polite (Don't want to say rude)."
2,A Quick reminder of a calender you may want to miss.,"Leonard Maltin's publications are usually fantastic. This calendar, however, was a big disappointment.This title offers 366 short one paragraph capsule reviews of Leonard Maltin's favorite films. It is printed in black, white and grey with no photographs. The reviews that I read provide no real insight into the films. It also has a very basic layout which makes the calender even less appealing. (Many calendars which provide black and white text only, present it in a layout that makes it appealing when displayed. This one does not!)"
2,No Photos?,"This calendar provides interesting info, but there are no movie-photos! I was extremely disappointed when I opened the plastic wrapping and saw that each page is All Text, with no pictures of the movies, actors, characters..... There must be another calendar out there for movie-lovers that treats us to some pictures, too! I will keep looking for a better movie calendar. I really expected better from ""Leonard Maltin""..."
3,Not highly sparkly,I expected more from this gloss then what I got. It doesn't go on the best and isn't very sparkly. Not the best quality. If it were cheaper it would be more worth it.
1,waste of money,I bought this to help cover us while we were out in public.....in four words it just doesn't work.I ended up buying a nursing wrap made by the Firts Years it's ugly but it works!
4,Had a few bad luck here and there.....,"Last year I purchased a Bissel and it's been great.... the only problem I've had is/was replacing the rubber strap that sits at the bottom of the vacuum, it's the thing that allows the brush at the bottom to spin. Since the brush from the vacuum doesn't shut off during the use of the attachments, I've managed to pull things into the vacuum and stop it from spinning... which led to the strap breaking. I guess it just shows how good the sucking power is. I've replaced two straps so far, I'm sure I will replace more.... good thing is you can find them at any target or k-mart."
1,This Product SUCKS!,"And not the way it should! Went through multiple belts, dealing with disgusting electrical burning smells, and spotty temperamental service at its best. Avoid this POS...."
3,"This isn't a bad book, but...","This isn't a bad book, but it's namesake _The 50 Greatest Movies Never Made_ does a far better job at similar material. There is almost no overlap between the two books, despite the fact that the former book does cover a good deal of science fiction.Where I think this book fails most is its approach. It's spends a lot of time dealing with production notes on the movies that were made instead (for example, Alien3), instead of the movie that wasn't made (Aliens vs. Predator). Furthermore, it never gets to the key issue -- why would this particular unmade movie have been great?So, I'd recommend this book only as a follow-on if you've already read the ""original""."
4,"Such a great book, film lovers and sci-fi fans will love it!","This is a really fascinating look at sci-fi projects that never made it to the big screen, some of which will leave readers wishing they could've seen the final results in live-action. The book really packs a lot of stories and inside info into the chapters, includes great concept artwork for some projects, and is written with a nice brisk pace that doesn't feel rushed but doesn't linger in unimportant details, either. If you are a fan of cinema, a sci-fi fan, or just generally like interesting reading about art and pop culture, you'll enjoy this book. My copy was reasonably priced and shipped on time, and was in new condition. I'm very happy with it, bought additional books from the author in fact, and would recommend it."
1,Boring!! Don't waste your money on this book.,"I can't believe this book was even published! Reading the book is like reading a very bad personal journal of the author, with trite bulls**t advice mixed in. It is in no way helpful to me in my future career with adolescents nor can I see it being helpful to anyone else. She may be a counselor, but she IS NOT an author."
1,worked for 3 weeks,Timex watch simply stopped working after wearing it three weeks. Not subject to rough use either. Not what I expected from a Timex.
3,too curved ..,you get what you pay for....the watch is simply too curved for my wrist. in profile it almost looks like a half circle. so this would be good for smaller bony-ier people.... but not a bigger 6'1 guy..its a simple inexpensive watch for wet locations
3,Great product for the price,"This is a nice easy to use watch, easy to setup, with a large clear display, and for the price you can't beat it."
5,Great functioning watch,Well made and sturdy. Gets the job done. Band has held up good. Long lasting battery too. Timex makes a good watch for the money. Beats some of the more expensive watches for value and price.
2,meh..,"I excited to replace my older white ben sherman sneakers with these ones only to be disappointed. The shoe feels ok, but definitely runs small, I had purchased my former pair at size 11 and figured it'd be the same for these ones... nope. Should have been 12. Quality isn't as good as I'd like and the design looks better in the picture than in real life."
2,Looks Great...,"This sneaker really looks so great. But, it really does run small. I bought for my husband in his regular size. It cut off circulation to his toes. Unfortunately, had to throw away in the end. If you buy this shoe, definately go a size larger."
5,The best Fear Street book ever!,This is one of my favourite books. It's absolutely excellent and I couldn't put in down! It is told by Nora Goode and follows her story of the Fear Street family and curse. If you haven't read it yet then I strongly advise you to read it now!
1,What case?,"I'm sure I'll love the case . . . when I get it. I ordered it well over a month ago and I still haven't recived it. It was due early august, then august 11, now I just checked and it's Sept! The kicker is I was never notified of a backorder. They said it was in stock.grrr."
2,ratchet is junk,I have had several of these cases in the last two years and the ratchetting mechanism has broken on all of them causing the phone to swivel upside down and open constantly but I don't think there are alot of other options if you wish to protect your phone.
5,extremely helpful!!,"this book is excellent, not only because it deals with interesting subject matter, but also because it deals with the interesting subject matter as it comes up in many different creative media. the labyrinth in music, art, mythology, gardening, religion, and dance is a powerful symbol that still ilicits creativity and excitement today. the chapters concerning music are particularly inciteful, because they discuss the structure of the selected melodies in the text and point out the inherent metaphors that are twisted into them -- rather like the winding mazes they represent."
5,You'll soon have it memorized!,"With colorful photographs of favorite Sesame Street characters and everyday objects to count, this book will be a favorite read for both parent and child. The bright pictures and simple premise make it a wonderful choice for baby, while the sight of familiar friends and the joy of counting may appeal to toddlers."
4,Woman of the West,Great book in great condition. Fast shipping. Good service. If you like books about settling in the West this is a must for woman and men to read. Every book I read about woman crossing the country for a better life I am amazed at how strong we are.
5,"Personal, Yet Professional Account of Women of the Old West","Women Of The West, by Cathy Luchette and Carol Olwell, offers an exceptional glimpse into the lives of women on the American frontier. Well-written stories, coupled with primary source photographs, provide personal accounts of the world that women lived in West in the 19th Century. Readers are drawn to not only the distaff side of pioneering but also to comparison of the usual male world vs. female world of that era. Dates and venues of the West that are familiar to historians are enhanced with personal color details of the lives of women who experienced the hardships that birthed the nation. This book is a must for the collections of those who love the history of the American West. While it is a great coffee table showpiece, it is much more---a marvelous book to pick up to read an account and linger over the revealing photographs."
4,Ferrara one of the best American makers of foreign films,"If you appreciate films by the likes of Antonioni, Lynch, Bunuel and Franju and you enjoy entering the inner worlds of characters then you'll probably find much to admire in this movie... it is unapolagetically dark, meandering, atmospheric, sometimes half baked, but ultimately haunting and utterly poignant. The DVD is bare bones with a decent transfer."
1,gotta have more than misery,"that's pretty much all it is. some good acting, but a pointless film. (but if you're a Beatrice Dalle fan, watch it once; or watch the first few minutes. she disappears after that.)"
1,Gratuitous obcenity and (very) soft porn,"A confusing silly mishmash of soft porn and filthy language topped off with a raving Dennis Hopper, who during a long period in his career appeared in a number of stinkers, apparently to pay the rent.There is nothing of any artistic merit in this travesty of moviemaking - the editing, direction, story, music, photography and acting are all ludicrous and repellent, without exception. Matthew Modine, in his excessive kissing scenes seems to be wanting to prove something...if you make it past the early scene, I suppose you can survive the rest of the movie.Well maybe there is one exception - Claudia Schiffer IS a sweetie and she deserved a better vehicle in her first major film role; she's tolerably competent and nice to look at. Unfortunately, her character is brutalized and abused for caring, and somehow she always comes back for more; maybe she's a masochist."
5,Beautiful fragrances endure,"I always liked the scents from the house of Molinard de Molinard, and this is one of my old time fragrances. I love the scent it leaves lingering in my closet as well as on my skin. It truly is or was an original and I'm glad it is still available. I cannot describe the ""notes"" I detect, but it is a sophisticated scent. I firmly believe that beautiful fragrances do endure!"
5,outstanding indeed,"A very approachable and informative book by a very knowledgeable and kind lady, Gail Faith Edwards of Blessed Maine Herb Farm. I remember when she started the company decades ago and am amazed and delighted at how it has grown. I knew I would love this book, because I love Gail and I love herbs, but my high expectations were actually exceeded! I recommend this so highly. I know it may seem that I am biased, given that I do know Gail, but notice that everybody else reviewing this book says the same thing: IT'S WONDERFUL!"
2,Eisa Okinawa,If you are looking for traditional music this is not the CD for you. The CD is a westernized compilation using electronic intrumentation. It is without any true Okinawan sounds.
4,Liked it !!!!!!!!,Good Movie keeps your attention. A little slow in places and thats the reason why I gave it 4 stars........
3,Peckinpaw,"I have to admit that what I liked about this movie was the fight scene in the kitchen. I am really into martial arts and I think that one reason is seeing Sam Peckinpaw's work back in the 1970s and 1980s, while I was growing up. He was the master of the slow-motion action shot, and we now see it in the films of John Woo and other directors. This is I think a pretty mediocre film, directed by one of the great directors, and like I said, that one scene really stuck in my mind over the years. It is a watchable film overall."
3,i hope this is the beginning....,"it's daft, tired and hollow... But i find this Peckinpah movie quite entertaining, but i've just taken an oppurtunity to say the following:I hope this is the beginning of a 'Peckinpah collection' from anchor bay, a double disc edition of his most neglected masterpiece 'Bring me the head of Alfredo Garcia' would be greatly appreciated. I find 'Convoy', 'The Getaway', 'Junior Bonner', 'The Killer Elite' and 'Cross of Iron' all either tedious, revolting or both. They are all available, but not Peckinpah's last real achievement, strangely a film derided by even some of those that write books about him. It's time this ugly but wonderful, totally unorthodox love story was given a new life on DVD, restored. It's both the most typical and atypical film Peckinpah made."
3,Just OK,"It wasn't at all like the book, which was quite good. Some good suspense at times but the whole was a bit of a letdown. I think John Hurt's character had a legitimate axe to grind, but lost my support through insanity."
4,DVD Re-issue Crusade!,"If it looks like I'm on a mini-Crusade to get certain films reissued on DVD, I am. This is one of the most intriguing action films around with Peckinpah's signature style. A little hard to follow, but so was Mission Impossible!"
5,Intense from start to finish,"Andy Hunter (www.andyhunter.com)'s first release sweeps the listener into a world of his own. Each track reaches a different intensity of sound as andy demonstrates his skill with rhythms, beats, and turn tables. Probably the most climactic song on the album is ""Amazing,"" with sweet, bold, ambient vocals and music that surges through your body. Another hit, ""Translucent,"" offers a sense of peace and tranquility as listeners are whisked away into a dream.This album is a necessity for any music lover, whether or not he's inclined to dance/techno music. It takes one to places of pleasure, and refuses to take you back...Look for andys sophomore release on May 24th, a promised hit."
5,Let The Music Begin!,"""Go"" The first track on Andy's exodus starts off by coaxing you into a false sense of calm before breaking into a high paced Anthem for those in the fast lane. ""The Wonders of You"" was featured in EA's highly popular ""Need For Speed: Underground"". Other noteables on this album include ""Amazing"" (which features the vocals of Christine Glass), ""Sandstorm Calling"", and ""Intercessional"" round out a great album to do just about anything from Dancing to Driving to Relaxing."
2,This is a great album,"I bought this album just because they paired it with Furious Angels by Rob Dougan. And to my surprise it was a great album. I love the track Amazing, and Wonders Of You. The woners of you track was featured in Need for Speed Underground and I loved then and as no surprise the entire album was great. I can listen to the entire album without skipping a track and for me thats very rare."
1,Of Questionable Value,"I am being charitable to have given this book a 1 rating. If you want a reliable book, try to find BACKGROUND OF A BANDIT: THE ANCESTRY OF JESSE JAMES by Joan M. Beamis and William E. Pullen. Otherwise this will have to do. Steele's book has a chapter on the ""Tennessee James Family"" that should be taken with a barrel of salt. There are plenty of James families scattered across the country, but it's a subject of question as to whether there is any relationship with Jesse James of Missouri. I have heard that the errata in this particular book would be substantial."
5,Fascinating Concept and Storyline,"Solid characters and dialogue accent the lavish scenery and exciting storyline. I found this book to be one those you just can't put down-it grabs and holds your attention, entertaining you all the way. The story takes place in the 1960's and the Federal Government is into some exotic test programs to help win the Vietnam War. With much the same ""feel"" as an Area-51 thriller, this story takes the reader into the mindset of the military at that time. Since the author is a retired U.S. Army Colonel, he adds just enough twists to keep a reader wondering ""what if."" The journey you'll take through the pages of this book will provide you with hours of sincere pleasure. I recommend it most highly."
4,Diario della studentessa Jean,"Diaro della studenteessa Jean is an ideal tool for students of Italian wishing to gain confidence in their reading and writing skills. The slim volume is well worth the modest price and is a much-needed accompaniment to standard beginning texts that focus on grammar and cultural readings written in more sophisticated Italian. A workbook (Eserciziario per Diario della studentessa Jean) is also available and provides valuable, structured exercises for developing competency in the language. I highly recommend Diario for its straightforward style that encourages beginning students to write and speak with greater ease about everyday experiences."
2,"Quick read, but a little flimsy","For someone who is starting to learn Italian it is a nice practice story, but it isn't very substantial. It's a very short story and it doesn't include any exercises. You are much better off spending your money on something like ""Better Reading Italian""."
3,40 pages,"To let you know that this ""book"" is 40 pages long and is about 1/8 inch thick.This was not in the description. It may be worthwhile reading but I would not have paid $12.50 for it."
1,incorrect order,"the order I placed was not what I recieved ,you cannot go by the picture shown , I was looking for cleansingbar with lanolin and did not get it , buyers beware,"
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Free the slaves from the alien Alpha overlords. Rise up, with spaceships. That sort of thing.Rose Rico has managed to pull together enough of an effective forceto do something about the situation for the maligned and put-uponthroughout the galaxy.About as unlikely a leader type as you coulud imagine, to begin with."
4,Best solution for iodine-free salt,"This package maximizes your value for money as it is quite economical when compared with the 2,5 grams pouches. And it comes with a handy spoon measuring exactly 2,5 grams. So all you have to do is measuring 250 mL of water (you can use the Nasaline syringe for that (4 times 60 mL = 240 mL + 10 mL) fill up the spoon and mix well. Use tepid water, salt will dissolve quicker. The cover is air tight, so salt is kept without moisture for a long period. Anyway, stroe it at room temperature."
3,No better than table salt and more expensive,"Nasaline is used to make a saline solution for nasal irrigation. As a sinus sufferer, I've been doing nasal irrigation for years, using table salt to make the solution. Nasaline is available in pre-measured packets, which were very convenient to use while I was on vacation recently and I do recommend the packets for their convenience; however, for everyday use, Nasaline is much more expensive than table salt and doesn't work any better."
4,nasaline salt,The shipment and delivery of the product was Ok. I've been using the product for a while and it has worked for me.
2,very cheap!,"The majority of this DVD is minor league stuff and what little NHL footage there is its before 1990 and has no info of the fight, the voice over is quite annoying and a good majority of the fights are just short clips."
1,This 'coulda been a contender',"This, unfortunately, sounds like it was a great performance--both Flagstad and Melchior at the peak of their vocal gifts, Furtwangler gloriously confirming his place in the small constellation of great Wagner conductors--but for all that, the sound is atrocious: dim, murky, hissy, and suffering in dynamic range. One day, sound reproduction technology might be able to salvage this wonderful historical document, but it's obviously too mighty a challenge for modern day sound engineers."
5,Boldness on paper,Harold Pinter speaks his own... dialect... without cliches.As my native language is Greek I usually find the English language plain... not this time!Harold Pinter here attempts to remove the blindfold from most of us and on our behalf...Intelligent and impulsive.
2,The political writings are the turn off,"If Pinter contented himself with Becket- Ionesco- like dialogues of the deaf, poetic renderings of fragmented human inadequacy then it would be possible to appreciate a certain poetic quality in him. But he like a good Stalinist has to dictate for us the nature of our political reality, and in doing so turns out to be a truly one- sided fanatic, choosing what to my mind, are the bad- guys in every conflict in the world. His hatred of America is in my mind sickening and unfair. He makes the best into the worst, and celebrates radical terrorists and other chic dirt.Boo."
5,Fun to play over and over!,"This album has so many different beats and styles, it's great to put on repeat. I think Playdough is extremely talented and versatile. I love his rapping style, he flows with the words like butter. Beats are original and the album has a real underground style to it."
4,"A wonderful, bittersweet, touching story...","This was one book that cannot be put down...this is one of those stories that takes you back to the earlier days when you were six, when you were twelve, when you were fifteen, when you were eighteen, and remembering all those funny and sweet yet somewhat bitter and sad moments in your life, growing up, your first crush, your first real love, etc. The First Sandcastle is one book that will make you laugh a bit yet make you cry..."
3,Characters to care about,"Mr. Delgado has written an interesting first novel that should especially appeal to older teenagers and those who vividly remember the excitement and heart aches of those years. I found myself caring about the lead character Marlo and his friends, hoping that his first love would not end badly, that his dreams would be fullfilled. The book has a momentum of its own, with a believable ending that most of us can wistfully relate to in our own experiences. Congratulations to Mr.Delgado for starting his writing career."
1,a football shouldn't be hard to make,"another reviewer had the same experience i did - it leaked when inflated - right through the hole through which you insert the pin. how that passed quality control, if there is any, is beyond me. whoever is making these should stick to pet rocks or rakes, something as simple as possible. Nerf footballs would also work - no worries about leaks."
2,Bad Ball,I had high hopes for this ball given that it is supposedly an official game ball. The first one I got had a hole in it so I couldn't inflate it to get the dent out of the ball. The second one was super slick- it was almost impossible to throw and catch properly. Wilson makes a sponge called Tac Cube which is supposed to revitialize the tack to the ball but it is impossible to find a place to get it. Either Wilson lacks decent quality control or I just got unlucky twice. I think I'll try a NIke game ball instead.
5,Where's the orginial chapter 20?,"I would like to ask a question or get clarification on one issue I have with this work; Where's the original chapter 20?The back cover says that the chapter is titled: ""Future Possibilities of Mind Power"", however the chapter in the book is titled, ""Now You Have The Power-Use It"".I'm in the process of rereading this wonder and important work that I read and proved in my life over 20 years ago so maybe I'll find that my question is invalid and, if so, please ask for this post to be deleted.Thank you,Raymond"
5,TNT the power within you,"Great book, I read this book years ago and liked it then, and I like it even better now!"
5,Invigorating and refreshing,"Claude Bristol has put in every passion to rouse the general readers from their torpor and frustration and to charge them with certain magnetism. A marvellous book on the workings of human psychology deep down in our inner mind. However things may not be so easy to attain. The power of imagination and visualization referred in the book needs to be followed up by hard labor in any human discipline. That is why God helps those who helps themselves. There is no scientific or empirically verifiable way to establish the power of mind to attain mundane things. Nevertheless, a very useful metaphysical book to lift the spirit in times of depression. Well written and deserves full credit and of tremendous value as a guide book.Gautam MaitraAuthor of "" Tracing the Eagle's Orbit: Illuminating Insights into Major US Foreign Policies Since Independence."
5,A Powerful Punch,"This book was copyrighted in 1954--that will soon be 50 years ago. The public is looking to all this new age material such as ""The Secret"" in the hope of learning what Claude M. Bristol told us almost 50 years ago in ""TNT The Power Within You."" The difference in these books is the obvious hyperbole of ""The Secret"" as opposed to the gripping truth of the words written by Claude Bristol. I don't believe for a minute that Claude Bristol wrote ""TNT"" for a quick sell. I believe he sincerely meant every word he put on paper, words with a power that grips you page after page. The message is so profound that, as you read and even after you have set the book aside, emerging insights are so profound that they are startling. The message contained in this book is dynamic. Scrap ""The Secret."" It hasn't been a secret for the past forty-four years. Do yourself a favor and buy a copy of this book. Then READ IT."
3,it's all about you...,I read this book within a couple of days. It had some great information that I hadn't found in the +30 LOA books I have previously read. Worth it.
2,"Big Stroller, Small Carrying Bag","I bought a brand new Dreamer Design Manhattan Single Stroller for a trip to Jordan. After receving the stroller I decided to buy the carrying bag too, to protect the nice looking stroller from the bad manegament it could received in the airport. This brand makes big strollers, and i preasumed by looking at the picture(the picture show a stroller with the wheels on that fits perfectly in the bag) that the bag should be big enough and the stroller should fit in it perfectly. I preasumed wrong, after 20 minutes trying to put the stroller inside the bag, my husband suggested to take out the wheels. It took us another 20 minutes to put the stroller and the wheels inside the bag and we almost couldnt closed it and the zipper looked like it was going to broke. This carrying bag is design by the same company of the stroller and the stroller should fit perfectly with the wheels on. I really dont know what happens with this one!"
4,"High quality construction, but built wide","I liked the design, so I ordered this hoody. It is made of high quality fabrics, is nice and heavy, and is solidly constructed.My single complaint is it is built for wide people, and the bottom is loose and baggy with no drawstring or elastic to speak of, and so lets cold air in. I would go the next size down, but the arms on the too-wide one I have now are just barely long enough as it is."
3,One of the Most Interesting Bigfoot Stories Ever,"This is a fine piece of work, but too short. Worth the read as it is a classic.I don't know the author and I am not associated with the author in any way"
2,A clever farce,"This is a well written farce, plain and simple. While we all wish something so spectacular would happen to us, we should not let our fascination with such a possibility blind us from objectivity. The author writes well and, in some moments, seems to be describing a real experience. However, the facts just don't add up. It is simply too convenient for the author that: 1) he never told anyone about the bigfoot he lived with, 2) he never photographed it, 3) it died, 4) he had to chop the body to pieces, and 5) he doesn't remember where he buried it. All together, these excuses provide too convenient a way for him to not provide any real evidence that any of this ever happened. A silly book, all told."
3,The Bigfoot Experience,"It is a cute little book and entertaining. I wanted to believe it but just couldn't. I would think that if someone did have multiple encounters with Big Foot he would have gotten a picture, footprint or something for evidence. I don't know if Big Foot exist, but we can keep on hoping. You won't walk away from this book being convinced that Big Foot is out there."
3,Very entertaining but truthful?,"I enjoyed this book for the most part. It was entertaining. I have to admit that I found the sexually related parts of this tale to be just plain repulsive and creepy. As a person who has had an encounter with such a creature I am a believer. I do not, however, have a lot of confidence in the truthfulness of this book. The tale told is so bizarre, wierd and unbelievable. I would give greater consideration if the author's identity was revealed as well as the specific geographic location of the proported encounters."
1,Spend the money for a better item.,This item waited until 3 days post warranty for the LCD screen to drop out. Apex customer service is notoriously unhelpful and essentially useless if you are trying to get assistance. The machine read MP3 disks only sporatically and all and all gave a frustrating performance.
2,Warning Product Description is Wrong!!,"If you are looking for an embriodered sweatshirt, move on. This product does not come embriodered but rather screen printed. Just trying to save someone the hassle."
1,Sinners Lounge,"I am a music enthusiast who enjoys smooth jazz, fusion, and R&B, along with lounge and chill music in particular. I had high hopes for the two-disk compilation Sinners Lounge. Wow, was I disappointed! There wasn't a single tune that was memorable for me; there was no track I wanted to hear twice. In my opinion the best thing about this CD set is the image on the cover of the packaging."
4,"Short but, oh, so sweet","Great television performance from April, 1959, featuring Miles' legendary quintet (including Coltrane, Wynton Kelly, Paul Chambers and Jimmy Cobb) and the Gil Evans Orchestra.They play:""So What""""The Duke""""Blues for Pablo""""New Rhumba""In terms of picture quality, this was the first time I've seen the broadcast (barring the few, bracing moments of ""New Rhumba"" used in Ken Burns' Jazz) so I have nothing to compare it against but it looked fine to me, considering the source.It's under 25 minutes and there's not an extra feature to be found, which is a shame, but this is both historic TV and incredible music. Maybe one day there'll be an expanded edition but until then, this is where it's at."
1,Strike two,"This is the second copy of this DVD I've order. The first one was defective and so is this one. I think it might be the recording was not transfered properly to DVD. It's to bad because it's a great performance of Miles and Coltrane at the peak of their powers, I've seen it before. I am gonna try one more time and see if I get a good copy it's worth it. But 3 strikes an your out!!!"
4,The Good Old Miles,"If you are enamoured by the first fifteen years of Miles Davis' career as band leader, about 1950-1965, and have many of his recordings from that period you've probably yearned for a full video from that period. Well finally they've managed to give us something. Cool Jazz Sound presents the first Miles Davis quintet plus the Gill Evans orchestra. Given that the source of this release is dated I am more than pleased by the quality of the black and white video and also of the sound. What is somewhat disappointing is that it is only 23 minutes long. I am almost certain that enough material exists to issue a DVD twice as long instead of one with only four songs. Still, Blues for Pablo is as beautiful as ever, and I take back one star only for the brevity."
4,"Great music, but a unsatisfactory picture and only 25 minutes long.","Kick ass performance, good for a one time watch but at only 25 minutes and with a less than stellar picture I can't see shelling out 15 clams for it. I did like the way the camera moved around, at one point even showing Miles in the background off stage taking a smoke break while the other guys are rockin' out."
2,Disappointing,"A purchased this because the reviews / summary indicated this would be a good history of Scotland for kids. I needed a book my 6 year old could understand to study Scotland for his school project. I can barely get through it myself, it's so boring. Too many superfluous details. I can't even tell what's true or not."
5,Happy Son-in-Law,Bought this for my son-in-law's birthday. He is a Snoopy fan and this completed his set. If you like Snoopy... this is a great item!
5,Peanuts 1955-1958,Highly enjoyable book.I received it (in Italy) in only 4 days.I already knew this series and thought it could be a brilliant Xmas present for my 18-year-old niece
5,A true gem,"My youngest son has spent hours reading the Peanuts books I got from the Weekly Reader Book Club when I was a kid. So for his birthday I bought him this set. He and I have spent many, many very enjoyable hours together reading these volumes out loud. He likes to read Linus, Lucy, and sometimes Snoopy, and I read the rest. It is satisfying to watch my son get as much enjoyment from these strips as I did when I was his age.I'm sure I'll continue buying these books for him -- and secretly enjoy them as much as he does as we read them together."
4,Completely Awesome... Peanuts 1955-1958,"This series is going to be a regular drain on my bank balance for the coming decade, as that is how long it is going to take Fantagraphics to finish publsihing this collection, if they stick to their published schedule.Both books included in this boxed set are exactly the same as the separately-published volumes with full book jackets. These are the same books as the separate volumes, with an added slipcase.Be warned: The Sunday strips are not in colour unlike the Calvin & Hobbes and the Farside collection in which even the black and white strips are printed on colour pages. This quite pisses me off..."
5,Fantastic,Looks great and so glad to have it. This actually got delivered before another order (also fulfilled by Amazon)that I place almost a week before.
3,Unable to watch it on my dvd player,I received this movie as a christmas gift but have been unable to watch it on my dvd player. So for now it is sitting on my selve until I buy a different player it will play on.
4,Interesting but of limited usefulness,"If you live in the Four-corners region of the Southwestern US and are interested in local plants, this is an interesting read. It is, however, more of an academic work than a practical one. Statements like ""is said to have been used for..."" and ""may have been used..."" dot the text, which are not useful statements for a reader who wants to put the information into practice. Also the medical uses listed for plants are very vague and so generalized that they have no practical usefulness unless the reader is willing to experiment and see what happens (a risky proposition, especially if you're ill!) All of that said, it is enjoyable for historical/cultural information and region-specific information (living in New Mexico I instantly recognize most of the plants talked about and enjoy hearing about them, even if the information isn't of much practical use)."
5,This Book Smokes!,I got an advanced copy at work left in my mailbox.Glad I did. This book smoked from the first page to the last.Jay Marvinauthor of Punk Blood
1,Good writing but dragging plot and unlikable characters,"This is a well written book, and I think Ms. Troy is very talented, but, GAWD! The book does indeed float- the plot drifts all over the place, until my attention is on a much BETTER book. What is this thing about, anyway? I can't tell. All the characters are what I would call trailer park trash. . .uneducated, boring people who are incredibly unlikable. I guess it's fortunate that I can't relate to any of these people. I think I'll go back to James Joyce."
1,Yuck!,This book was horrible with boring characters and a boring story. I hate to say it but I was very unhappy with this book. I want to spare other people the disappointment I went through. Please don't buy this book if you are curious about the story borrow it from the library!
3,An Unnerving Read,"This novel is not for the faint of heart.A ring of kidnappers has been snatching ladies and girls in Europe, then proceeding to get them hooked on herion and force them to prostitute themselves to maintain their dirty habit. Luckily ex-mercenary's Creasy and his adopted 19 year old son have a vested interest in destroying ""The Blue Ring"".The writing in this novel is relatively crisp and clean, perhaps counterpoint to the main plot line. Some of the passages Quinnell pens are indeed very unsettling and disturbing in his description which is almost too realistic. One almost HAS to wonder just how many papers he pulled his plot from, yet paradoxically there are parts where the reader must suspend their disbelief in order for the story on the whole to work.I enjoyed this book even though it almost gave me nightmares as Quinell redefined what and who evil is in this world."
1,Not what I expected.,"This was an older, signed model (signed by some obscure player, who no longer plays) - though it was not advertised as such. It was probably was a publicity unit offered by the team at some point I returned it without problem. 'Just had to eat the shipping costs."
5,"Brillant detail, truly engenious","Featuring sketches that Mr. Hyung had stashed away, he was convinced to make this artbook.I couldn't be happier.His art style isfresh and gives a breath of life into a foreign comic economy that seems to be filled with too many big eyed anime creeps.His style is often harsh, and gives a since of surrealism in it's details. If you are fan of his currently published comic ""Priest"" you will love this artbook.Featuring over 100 pages of amazing art, this is a truly wonderful buy whether you just like Min-Woo Hyjng or just enjoy artbooks."
4,Great for Star Wars fans who are game novices,"As a fifty year old father of an eight year old son fascinated with Taikwondo and Star Wars, I was delighed to find this guide. Much more detailed the the user manual with maps and shortcuts and ways to avoid being wiped out. Some of the images are difficult to see, but it manages to get you through the game. We are only three levels deep in a dozen level game as I write this review, but I have enjoyed having a place to go when we get stuck. There are several walkthroughs on the web, which I also recommed, but none with annotated pictures and all the secrets pointed out. This is our first non-educational game (along with Star Wars Racer) and our first experiecne with gamepads and 3d accelerators (my son catches on so much quicker than I) and we are having a ball. I read and he does the dirty work. Lots of fun. Thanks"
4,Kaltar: a new Jean-Michel Jarre,"Hailing from Aguascalientes, Mexico, Kaltar recently released his album Emotional Backlash. A great work of electronic music, the album reminded me of the greatest of new age and electronic music.There was a definite sound of Jean-Michel Jarre present in most songs, but Kaltar goes beyond his influences and brings in elements of jazz and a use of piano and choir voices throughout the album that gives it a more 21st century feel.For the fans of new age and electronic music, this is an up and coming artist to keep your eye on."
4,Great workout set,"I've been a big fan of Rodney Yee's videos for a while now and this one is no exception. Very gentle but strong work-outs that you really feel the benefits of the following day. There are a couple of editing issues that were puzzling, but fortunately I was looking down before the first time I realized that the action on the DVD was behind the vocal instruction in a couple of section in the Yoga Burn."
3,PoYo,"I love most of Rodney's yoga work. However, this is not one of my favorites. It it broken into 10-15 minutes segments that do not play in sucession but you must select individually. that may workout well for some people but takes the fluidty out of the workout something -in my opinion- you do not want to do when you are in a yoga pratice."
4,Yoga for beginners,"I appreciate the repetition and clear instruction in this video. I saw Rodney in an ad in my Pilates DVD and got interested. I was a bit skeptical because I don't want the ""religion"" or the spiritual side of Yoga. I choose to worship Jesus so I don't say or do some prayer poses. The exercise is challenging and effective!"
4,"Challenging, yet easy to follow","I am a new mom, having trouble losing the baby weight. I am also a yoga novice. This video collection is perfect for my needs--it is challenging physically, even giving me some cardio, yet the moves are easy to understand and the motion is slow and fluid, so that I do not feel overextended. It also works in segments, so that I still feel like I've gotten a work out even if babe wakes up after only twenty minutes.Highly recommended for most fitness levels, though I don't think someone who is totally new to exercise could handle it; you do need some experience with yoga and have good flexibility and core strength."
4,good video,"this is a good collection of videos, I have tried all three videos, but only really like one of them"
3,Not that Challenging,"I don't regret buying this, and I use it often. However, I was looking for a highly physically challenging yoga. There are some moves that are tough in this but not like I thought. Also, it uses the term Slow Burn yoga. I think they could go a lot slower and hold the poses for longer.It is a great stretch though. Like I said I still use it,"
5,Completed book,"It is one of the most beautiful book that I have read and studied before. From beginning to end all valuable ideas are in order.All kind of bridges (arch,suspended...)are avaliable.Spported with nice sketches and photos of bridges from all over the world.Giving an inspritation to an Engineer."
4,Easy to Use,This text does a very good job on demonstrating material with lots of sample problems. It also avoids tedious derivations of formulas that should already be second nature by the time you use a book of this level.
1,Incomplete,"The book came with chapter 11 incomplete. Besides this, chapters 11 and 12 are all mixed up. It's very expensive for me to return the item, so I have to keep it this way."
2,Why doesn't the descriptions state what units are used???,"I still don't understand why these book descriptions don't say what units are used. This entire book is in Metric and is pretty much useless to me other than the basic theory. I also have the Design of Highway Bridges by Barker Puckett and it is metric as well. At least include design examples in English units also! So be warned, if you want an excellent bridge engineering handbook that uses English units then this book is not for you!"
4,a primitive review,"Understanding that opinions are subjective, my opinion is that this is a wonderful book. The pictures draw me in and put me in a primitive, mellow mood. It is also inspiring in that when I'm finished with the book, I want to get started on a decorating project. The pictures are just so enjoyable."
3,Jessie Walkers Country Decorating,"I use this occassionaly when I am considering redecorating. Some of it has more formal approach than I like, but it is inspiring."
1,Piece of junk,"The ad description said ""deluxe"" it was everything but! No back light and no color (other than grayscale). Returned it a month ago and still no credit - had to pay shipping both ways even though item was not as advertsied. doubt anyone at Amazon will read this but maybe some poor prospective buyer might."
4,Rimbaud / Morrison,"Jim Morrison took the time to write & thank Wallace Fowlie for his interpreting Rimbauds works into English, making them easier for Jim to read. You can clearly tell that this was touching for the professor.There are some errors but Fowlie is the first to admit he did not know Morrison or much about him.It was an alright read & I am glad to have it to add to my collection."
4,Solid Guitar Film for Everyone,"I like the film because in addition to giving some interesting history, it showcases new players too. The Strat and the Les Paul are given equal time. This film is great for guitar players and non guitar players alike. Everyone will come away with things they didn't know previously, yet the film isn't too esoteric. A great orientation for new and younger players, with more than a few interesting points for experienced guitar geeks."
5,GUITAR WARS,"I had seen this product offered online several months ago and from what the advertisement said, knew that it was something I would like. What really piqued my curiosity was to find that others were interested in just a documentary over the solidbody vs. the hollowbody! I have always loved the music of the guitar- and although this video does not show any songs being played in their entirety, the focus is primarily in the documentary-style! I can appreciate the beauty of the guitar and approve its form as a work of art! If you see the guitar in the light I have presented, then you too, will enjoy this product for what it is: a documentary!"
5,"Solidgodies, An endless war?","This is one of the best videos ever produced focusing on the world of electric guitars. One either plays a ""Strat"" or a ""Les Paul."" All other guitars just pale in comparison. This video showcases the rise of both guitars in the early 50's till the modern time. There are many newcomers featured in the video that showcase the best of both guitars. After watching this video I just wanted to go to my music room, plug in, and turn up the volume. Hopefully, this will not be the last video from this production company."
4,Good non partial documentary,A great documentary about the history of these two solid body guitars. What good about this is because it wasn't partial at all. Although I would love to see authentic videos of legendary players in the documentary playing the guitars.
3,unexpected,I was expecting a music video with varius artists. Instead got a battle between gigson and fender. I did injoy the video and loaded it on my 400 disc changer.
3,Disappointing,"This topic is fascinating but deserves a thorough historical and analytical treatment, not a series of often disjointed anecdotes and descriptions of personalities of the moment. I expected more from reporters of the Financial Times."
2,Apparently Not A Big Enough Fan,"I purchased three years ago ""Sometimes a Circle,"" but paused time and time again before just recently deciding to purchase ""Kid Blue/Louise Goffin."" I finally took the plunge and realized quickly -- upon first listen -- that this CD should be reserved for big fans only. It is very simple, monochromatic, and immature in both its musical arrangement and well as its lyrical presentation. The production is similarly flat-sounding. To be fair, I gave it at least 10-15 listens in all. In my opinion, ""Kid Blue/Louise Goffin"" is a far cry from ""Sometimes a Circle,"" which, I believe, is an absolutely superb release."
4,Carla Bruni Is On The Soundtrack,Melissa from Washington DC should listen more carefully to the soundtrack as Carla Bruni is track 28 on the CD. It is not listedon the album credits but is listed on the album sticker. The other vocal song by Pamela Peacemaker is also on the album on track 29.
3,"Slow start, but better near the ending","If you like the trailer music, you will not find it on this soundtrack. The first half of the CD is slow and mild, while the second half picks up the pace."
2,"Great soundtrack, crummy cd","The movie's most memorable song--Carla Bruni's scene-stealing ""Quelqu'un m'a dit""--is not on this album. I could also swear there was more cool Serge Gainsbourg jazz stuff in the film than features here. Like the movie's heroines, I feel suckered and bereaved."
1,Cheaply made,"I ordered this to carry our stroller across country on a couple flights. When it arrived one zipper was busted. Hoping that the other zipper would hold out, it came to the airport with me where it promptly disintegrated. The dang thing just totally came apart. At that point it became even more of a burden as the broken thing had to have a place to go.Unless the company starts making this out of significantly sturdier material, do not have high - or any, for that matter - hopes for this product."
3,Good but has some issues,"The TV has a nice menu and colors look vivid. There is only 1 S Video input. However there are two issues with this TV. First, when in compressed widescreen mode, there is a visible gray horizontal line right above the viewable area that stretches across the entire screen. Second, the corners of the TV suffer from blurriness. The blurriness is most noticible when displaying text. This may be an issue for you if you like to watch DVDs with a lot of subtitles or watch shows which have a lot of text like Bloomberg Financial TV."
3,Old-fashioned User Interface,"If you absolutely need a Hebrew word processor, buy this. It uses old technology. Feels like Windows 95 times. You can really do the same thing with Microsoft Word."
4,A Solid Example of Drake's Roman SF,"I was surprised to see some low reviews of this one. It's a good, solid example of the same trademark combination of history (especially military history) and high-tech aliens as Drake's better-known Belisarius series. Theme: war is war, from the ancient past to the distant future, and the human mind is more important than the technology it faces.Drake's been there and knows his stuff, and he writes as convincingly about swords and armor as he does about the tanks he knew in Vietnam."
1,Not Recommended,"While I have enjoyed other of Mr. Drake's works, specifically The Dragon Lord and Killer, this book however was a disappointment. Plodding pacing and thin storyline left this reader cold."
1,Bloody Awful,"This book is a definite disappointment after Mr. Drake's magnificent effort in ""In the Heart of Darkness."" Under the impression that ""Birds of Prey"" would be another gripping foray into alternative history/science fiction, I began ""Birds of Prey"" with great excitment.The book begins well, but the characters lack depth, and the story line positively plods. Moreover, the dry, witty sense of humor that pervades ""In the Heart of Darkness"" is completely absent in this effort. Try the Belisarius series instead."
2,Dry and halting,"Alien threat from another time causes an agent of the Empire to go on a quest to save humanity. Lots of historical and fighting detail, so if you like that sort of thing, this book will probably mean more to you. I thought the characters were generally shallow and their motives for many things either too transparent or totally opaque-- it felt like a larger book that never managed to get fully developed. Too bad, because there were some flashes of interesting plot."
5,Excellent Album,"I first hard about this band through the snowboarding video game series, Amped.I really love listening to it because it just fits with snowboarding.If you're looking for some music to snowboard to, this is it."
4,Good Stuff,"Places to Park are a good band and if you like music that rocks and actually has good lyrics, you should get this album. They sound like Hot Water Music and As Friend's Rust. So if you enjoy those bands, you should definately pick this album up."
3,"Too detail for overview, too shadow in practice","I'm half way through this book. This is a very nice and comprehensive book to overview the history,future and competition development environment. But ,redundantly and redundantly, you will find the same description repeated and repeated all over the book (that's why 1142 pages). With more than 400 pages devoted to VRML, what you can learn is just very introductory, though the explanation is very clear but reduntant. To my frustration,most of the specificaions you need to know are not listed in this book. Instead you need to logon its web site to find out.Though it's quite comprehensive as far as the overview is concerned, it's not worth spending your time through more than 1100 pages to just learn a introductory skills. If you need practical real-world skills, look somewhere else, just like me."
2,Core Wb 3 d,The first 3 chapters are the most accurate and detailedoverview of 3D and the web I have ever come across in print.
3,"Useful, if somewhat suspect","Ambassador Pezzullo arrived in Managua at the end of June, 1979, shortly before the Somoza regime was toppled by a broad opposition coalition led by the Sandinista National Liberation Front. His book recounts the development of the crisis in Nicaragua, and the evolution of U.S. policy toward Somoza. Unfortunately, Pezzullo spends a great deal of time offering his opinions on Nicaraguan history rather than relating his own involvement. His tenure as ambassador to the victorious revolutionaries and, by extension, Carter's changing policy toward them, receives no attention whatsoever.Nevertheless, this is a primary source of significant value. It is not a scholarly analysis, and like any participant's account, it should be taken with a grain of salt. Viewed in this way it does provide insight to the problems confronting the Carter administration in Nicaragua, and to the mismanagement of its already limited options."
1,Picture is not accurate,"The picture is not what you will get. It is completely inaccurate. This is a box of 12 black markers, not 4 of different colors as pictured."
2,Too Many Details with No Focus,"I read ""Stand, Columbia"" with much eagerness, but I discovered that the book is hardly reader friendly. The writer's talent as a historian is strong, and his research into the university's history is excellent. But what's lacking is a sense of cohesiveness and character. What makes Columbia unique? Where do all these facts and details lead us? ""Stand, Columbia"" ultimately appears as if it were commissioned by Columbia University Press to be little more than a sugar-coated celebration of the institution's 250th birthday."
5,Smooth Philly Soul with touches of Jazz.,"Both Lou Rawls and Jean Carn were the most sophisticated and classiest vocalists to record for Philadelphia International Records. Because they both have deep vocal roots in jazz, they brought anew level of elegance and sophistication to Philly Soul. This nice compilation can't be considered definitive in anty way but it does a decent job at spotlighting both artists' vocal talents. For a deeper and greater appreciation of Ms. Carn's work I strongly suggest your buying the CD ""Closer Than Close: The Best of Jean Carn"",however. As for Mr. Rawls, his ""All Things In Time"", ""When You Hear Lou, You've Heard It All"" and ""Unmistakably Lou"" CDs are truly essential albums which are also his all-time best."
2,cute but no story,I generally like the Boynton board books (Doggies and happy hippo angry duck are great!) but this one doesn't have any story to it. It's just ok.
4,Sweet and to the point.,"I find myself changing up my voice (high and low) as I read to my son so he can get the idea of opposites. The pictures are cute, bright and to the point. I didn't give it 5 stars, because there's not a story line. From one page to the next is another set of opposites. If that's what you want, then this book is for you. If you want more of a story to connect from page to page, then you might not like it as much."
4,Not a bad little book on beginning oil work,"I've been working with oils magically for about a decade now and have many books on the subject. This is a nice little beginner's book. The author has a nice conversational style of writing and one can tell she speaks from the heart as well as from the head. What is wonderful about this book is the list of oil properties in the back. This is one of the few such books that one can get on Kindle and it's wonderful to be able to bring up the title on my I-Touch while in an herb shop and check on different oils. If you are looking for a book with lots of recipes then this might not be it, as it's more a how to then a recipe book but well worth the shelf space."
2,Generic rai,"Departures by Cheb Nasro did nothing for me. It is very bland and generic, and also too sentimental for my liking. I didn't enjoy listening to the album as a whole, but if a Cheb Nasro song was played amongst other rai music, it would blend in unnoticed.Stick with Cheb Mami and Rachid Taha, if you like rai."
4,One of the best...,I have read a lot of books on PhotoShop Elements but this is probably the best for my skill level (beginner - intermediate). The 220 pages are packed with great ideas and techniques - all well displayed and simply explained.
5,A WEALTH of information !,"If you love music this is an important book to own.The enormus amount of information here is handy to have for many reasons.Even though this is an essential country chart book,I would also consider it a must for pop collector's as well.Many artists who started in pop, then went to countrynow have greatest hits collections with songs from both genres.For me this country book and the pop book are essential!I wouldn't buy a hit's C.D. without these books to refresh my memory.They've saved me a lot of money and disapointments.If you love music, you should check out this wealth of information.I've owned the 1988 edition country book from 1988 to now.I decided to update, and I'm glad I did.This edition includes much additional information and is still easy to use.The book is also great to use for a check list of your collection,the uses are just about endless!"
4,Nothing familiar about this Arthur!,"Amidst a backdrop of famine and plague, the protagonist discovers the story of Arthur--only to witness the end of the man's great peace in civil war.There's none of the Malory-esque or 19th century noble savage stuff in here. This is the bare bones post-Roman Arthur; if he existed, this might have been his story. Great stuff, and well-researched."
3,Rare look at the Aviator/Billionaire/Madman,"This book may have been conceived as a tell-all after Hughes' scandalous end, but Mr. Dietrich does a surprising job of conveying what it was like working for Hughes, offering insight into the man that, frankly, many higher profile bios (THE AVIATOR film, for instance) fail to provide. It's a slight book, probably flew off the airport racks in the late 70's, and out-of-print now, but if you're a Hughes enthusiast I would recommend spending the day it would take you to read it (full disclosure: I met Mr. Dietrich's assistant once and he confirmed everything in the book)."
2,A so-so book on one facet of Hughes' life,"This book made me wonder where the rest of the story was when I reached the end. Mr. Dietrich's book rather comes off as sour grapes, but whether or not those really were his feelings is also hard to tell. His book covers the many gaffs and unfinished projects indicative of a person with OCD and the selfishness of a trustfund baby -- all of which, the problems resulting from such conditions, were mopped up or smoothed over by Mr. Dietrich. I don't doubt that the things the author mentioned happened, but I wonder where are the stories of the moments of Hughes' genius that one can read about in other publications, or even a hint of humanity as a person and an employer. After reading this book, I still feel the need to read another to get the entire story and not just a piece of the tapestry, as given here."
2,Really Bad Sound,I am a big IG fan however i have been disappointed about this DVD. The only things I have to say is that the sound on this DVD is not Dolby Digital or even properly coded for 5.1 sound in any for. The set list and the show are great however the sound is really a big disappointment. It does not even sound as good as a CD from them.really too bad it could have been great. lets hope the do release a DVD one day that does have good sound along with it.
4,Great on the buns,"Decent video, great on the legs, be sure to watch your form, some compound exercises can be a bit tricky with jerky transitions and can easily lead to injury, so make sure to use a lighter weight first, master the form, then gradually move up and you will definitely fill it in the buns."
5,A great ride,"This is an excellent documentary about the golden age of burlesque, warts and glamour. I was a little embarassed to realize my hometown, Detroit, was known as ""The Vatican"" on the burlesque circuit due to it's micro-managing regulation of how and what to strip. The ladies are all interesting characters."
3,"Decent magazine, and probably the best given the circumstances","A magazine that is written by many National Post alumni, I think Maclean's does a decent job with its Canadian and international content. Considering it is one of the few national magazines in the country, there's little competition, if at all. Its ideology comes across as mainstream, but for the most part it is decidedly right-wing, which is unfortunate because of its position as the virtually lone national political magazine. But Maclean's will never be capable of matching the breadth and talented writing in American magazines like Newsweek or Time, who recently transfered its remaining costumers over to Maclean's. While it is occasionally interesting, most of its articles are rather forgettable. If you're looking for Canadian politics and general interest, than you might be best served here. But if you don't mind foreign publications, definitely look elsewhere."
2,Part 1 of the Atlan saga,"The first in the Atlan series, we are introduced to young princess Cija and her adventure across prehistoric South America. Cija is taken hostage by the half-reptilian general Zerd, of the Kingdom of the North, as he travels across the continent to invade the kingdom of the South. She has a series of adventures with her faithful terror bird mount.The Serpent starts off very interesting but turns into a series of episodes that don't really lead into anything. The story ends rather abruptly with no real resolution- but not a cliff hanger either. I'm not really compelled to find the sequel."
5,One of the strangest adult fantasies ever written.,"Written by a pseudo-goddess emerging into adulthood, this book is set in an amazingly well imagined prehistoric fantasy world. Although much of the the content is exhiliratingly strange, it contains the very human emotions of lust, platonic love, grief and the pain of adolescence."
1,"The picture shows a set of brake pads, but...","The picture shows a set of disc brake pads by Wagner, but the item is definitely NOT a set of brake pads. They look like parts to a drum brake set (maybe). Now I have to figure out how to return these things."
4,The Little Tramp's Evolution,"As silent-film buffs eagerly await Flicker Alley's ""Chaplin at Keystone"" DVD set, this out-of-print Kino video provides the best showcase of the Little Tramp's yearlong tenure with Mack Sennett's Fun Factory. Running nearly an hour, ""Charlie Chaplin at Keystone Studios"" features good transfers of five embryonic shorts from 1914: ""Making a Living"" (the comedian's villainous film debut), ""Caught in a Cabaret,"" ""Mabel's Busy Day,"" ""The Masquerader"" and ""The Rounders"" (a memorable teaming with Fatty Arbuckle). The knockabout slapstick and hints of pathos in these rough-edged Keystone exercises would lead to greater artistic glories at Essanay and Mutual. Recommended viewing for any admirer of early cinema."
3,Different Ways of Film Editing...,"This book will give you a general history of editing. Also you will find in ""Editing for the genre"" section examples of different film editing ""styles"" for different genres. Honestly the principles of editing section is very weak. Also the non linear editing topic is not covered in depth. The name can be confusing for some people: This book is NOT about the technique and There is almost nothing on ""video"" in it. It is about creative and aesthetical sides of editing with examples from well known directors like Kubrick, Hitchcock etc."
1,It doesn't get worse,"I just read a chapter from this book on DMN. Maybe the author has something interesting to say or maybe some new insights - I'll never know. The writing is so poor that each sentence needs to be dissected to be understood.""In the world of the music video, real place is far less important. In fact, they are not as important as references to other media and other forms, to the landscapes of science fiction, and to the horror film."" Huh? I'm guessing that ""they"" means ""real place"" and therefore should been ""it is not as important..."" But I am not sure that is what he meant. I've seen bad writing like this in user forums but never in a book. Did he have an editor?I do have a book to recommend, though for the author, The Elements of Style. When you master that, try again but this time with an editor."
2,Quite terrible...,"I tried this stuff yesterday and tried my best while following the instructions and also reading all the reviews (and their included tips) here. Garbage! It looks absolutely not a single bit better than before I started, and in fact left this obvious film. I didn't saturate, over-use either. I tried paper towels, polish microfiber, regular towel, dry or wet, you name it.Terrible. I learned my lesson, will only hire pros to do this stuff. Not worth my aggravation. Thumbs down. I gave it 2 instead of 1 star in the event that I didn't do something right but I doubt it."
3,"OK, not great","Does an OK job of cleaning our granite countertop, but it typically leaves a visible film if you apply just a smidge too much."
3,ok but not fantastic,"Acts like a simple cleaner. Do not see a difference in the ""shine"". Will probably buy again but overall it is just another cleaner."
5,Stone Cleaner,This product arrived very quickly. Good cleaner. It gives my dark granite a nice shine. I will be buying this again in the future. I also purchased the Dupont Stone sealer.
5,Excellent cleaner,I am so glad a friend of mine recommended this product for my granite. It has made a substantial difference from the cleaners I have purchased at the retail stores.
1,No better than glass cleaner,"This stuff was a huge disappointment. My granite felt and looked no different or better after using than prior. I just don't understand the great reviews on here. You want an awesome granite polish? Buy Somaca Hi-Gloss product...smooth as silk granite after wiping off, and cheaper. No comparison and I don't know why I bothered trying anything else. Do not waste your cash on this DuPont product."
4,good product,Good on granite counter tops. This product cleans and seals. It was recommended to me by a professional stone company employee. We have used one bottle and ordered several more from Amazon.
3,Seems to be nothing more than Windex,"Maybe I am missing something. After using the revitalizer, I come away thinking it is nothing more than glass cleaner. It smells the same, and cleans the same. I do not notice any revitalizing going on with my granite counter-top. The bottle is nice though."
4,Great Demo,"Downloaded the public beta and it runs very well, my kids can't get enough. Graphics are good, play is smooth and realistic a few minor glitches but I'll buy it when it hits the shelves."
3,Fun. Lacks lyrics and rap.,"This is a very fun and entertaining CD which is worthy of buying. It doesn't have the excellent theology like L&C but it is alot of fun. If you are a thick ska lover you won't like it much. If you're a fan, you'll have fun. If you're like myself looking for a good dose of the 'rap' and Morginskyology than you will be a 'lil bit downed. He does hint at his genius from time to time but his skills were definitely more evident in previous albums, esp. Loud and Clear."
4,Turn up the volume- and enjoy!,"While not exactly what the Supertones have done in the past, but it still fits typical Tones profile: Loud, obnoxious and more addictive than any illegal substance. While no longer just ska, the rowdy boys from the west coast put out another great album. Matt ""Mojo"" Morginsky again puts powerful lyrics in a casual package, all with a bit of humor. Don't believe me? Check this out: ""I don't wanna be known as the handsome guy with the attitude."" it runs so fast you almost don't notice it. Emphasizing self-renewal and God's grace, as well as taking bites at pop culture and radio, disguised in punk/ska/rap/whatever, every song gets to you. It isn't a five because the Tones have done much better before, but this album is definately worth it.Jesus-driven punk. Who would've thought?"
2,"""Whatever!""","I decided to give this movie a try despite the many negative reviews. Boy was I sorry! This film is a travesty so save your time (and your money if you're thinking of buying). Milla Jovovich simply doesn't have the acting ability to pull this role off, plain and simple. She portrays Joan as a wild-eyed nut case and somehow it's hard to generate much sympathy for her in the end. Add to that the ridiculous dialogue (somehow I can't see 13th century people using the 21st century expression ""whatever!"") and you have a mess of a movie. The sets and costumes are fairly good and the battle scenes reasonably realistic but that's about all I can say for it.Go elseware for the story of St. Joan!"
5,Great,I loved this movie. The actress did a fantastic job depicting Joan of Arc.I will definitely see it again and again.
3,"I wasn't alive in 1429, but . . .","I thought as far as a movie is concerned, I thought it was pretty dramatic, excellent cinematography (?), and I definitely cried at the end. As far as accuracy, I wasn't alive in 1429, so I can't say for sure whether or not she ever got frustrated and felt terrorized by the voices. Perhaps she did. What 16 yr old girl doesn't have apprehensions when asked by god to lead a country into battle? I'm sure she had moments of weakness, as we all might.Anyway, if you are looking for a movie that follows the history books line for line, this isn't it. But, as far as an entertaining, heart-wrenching story, I would watch it again, for sure."
2,Qualcomm Technical Analysis Thrown Together,"Looks to me like Andy Viterbi pulled together some of the technical papers done at Qualcomm while developing CDMA. Of all the books Viterbi has written (or contributed to) this one seems like it was done in extreme haste. I disagree with other reviewers that claim he introduces the material well. No way.It is true that this book is a tour de force of the performance analysis of CDMA. However, I would not describe it as readable. Maybe, not that Viterbi has made his hundreds of millions of dollars, he take time out to write a second edition that is done right."
4,For mathematicians only,"Deep mathematicians concepts on Spread Spectrum technology. Even when i have only reviewed the first chapter deeply and the rest not too much, i got the impression it's for advanced level students. All my doubts are getting clear, and much knlowedge is still to come. Besides, it's Andrew Viterbi, one of the most important person besides CDMA technology."
1,I didn't find any of the topics that I need.,I thought that the web site was poorly constructed. I had may URL servers not found on topics that were tangabile to what I am researching. I found this web site to be a great dis-appointment and completely useless. All of these facts are sad but true.
3,"Well made, but...","This is a nice, solid ceramic piece. It is heavy, however, and the color (burgundy) was brownish and dull. I returned it. I may try the same item in Ruby, and see if it has better color. The heavy stoneware should hold the coolness necessary to keep the butter at just the right consistency."
4,"A little too big, but cute.","This is well made but a little too big for me. It can fit 2 sticks of butter, which some might find handy."
1,Butter Dish,Item received with dark scuff marks on both pieces which would not wash off. It appears the marks were on the pieces when they were bubble-wrapped and sent. Should have been obvious to the packer that this was not right.
4,Well Built,The design of the butter dish is very nice and my wife thinks that it is pretty and that is all that really matters.
2,Butter dish,"Was looking for something to replace the broken butter dish that came with our refigerator when it was new.This dish is nice, but fairly large for use as a table serving piece. Biggest problem, the dish arrived busted in upteen pieces due to poor packing by Amazon. I returned it for credit."
3,good buy,"nice color as shown. very large but accomodates the larger shorter sticks (two, end to end). wife didnt realize so big. might be considered more cumbersome for one handed moving."
2,butter dish,i was disappointed in the butter dish. It's too big and heavy. You can put in 2 sticks of butter where i only wanted it for one stick. Didn't realize it when i ordered it that it was so big.
1,BROKEN!,"Purchased this as a gift for my father who was longing for a butter dish with texture to avoid accidental breakage caused by slippery fingers. I thought this was the one, but it arrived in sad condition - the base was totally cracked through in multiple places. I could only get a refund, not replacement. The one I purchased was sold by MMP, LLC, so maybe other merchants would have better packaging... they sure seem to have better prices!"
5,Thank you so much,"It is a very nice CD, good interpretation und phantastic choreographie on the bonus dvd. I am happy to have it. Thanks for the quick delivery to Germany!"
1,A Smash!....In a Way...,"As A Huge fan of Fotomaker, The Raspberries and Wally Bryson I bought this album on vinyl the day it came out in 1979. 30 seconds after removing it from my turntable it became a broken Frisbee in the corner of my living room."
1,Woah...,"From someone sported by Nas, I expected better.I think the people below have said it best - Nashawn's CD is about as garbage as his outfit on the disc jacket.And for whoever's saying the NY scene is dead, you're just looking in the wrong places. Look at Louis Logic's ""Misery Loves Comedy"" for some of the best stuff out right now.= J"
4,Great Toy,"My 7 month old daughter loves this toy. The blocks are the perfect size for little hands. She uses them with the barn or alone. She also has the house, and soon to get the wash and wax. The blocks all interact with each toy so it doesn't matter which block she uses it works!!"
3,hard for younger children,"my son recieved this toy for christmas , he was almost 8 months old. he really liked the toy and wanted to play with it but the barn kept falling backwards when he was trying to put the blocks in. he would end up getting frustrated and i would have to take the toy away. i put it up until he was older and a little more cordinated. now at 13 months he LOVES it, but we continue to have problems with the barn falling over. he perfers to stack the blocks or put them in the truck (which is GREAT)and push them around."
5,One Not To Miss,Tom Philpott's skillful writing technique makes the saga of Jim Thompsom come alive. Each voice in this oral history speaks loud and clear. Do not miss this book. I could not put it down!
1,Too discombobulated for me,"I seem to be out of sync with everyone else who has read this book--after agonizing through twenty pages, I finally put it down for good. Having relied almost totally upon taped conversations with more than a hundred people who knew Jim Thompson over the years, the author (or, rather, editor) seemed to cut and paste excerpts from these conversations in a manner that made no sense to me. On one page we meet Jim after his stroke, on the next page he was a teenager, then two pages later his ex-wife pops up--no thanks, not my kind of book. On the other end of the spectrum, however, is ""Ghost Soldiers,"" the book I picked up next. Now there's a book worth reading."
1,Interesting but not typical,"Tom Philpott did a credible job on this book, that was a difficult story at best to recount since very few Southeast Asia POW's were captured in these unusual cirmstances.I'm surprised McCain endorsed it!"
3,Comprehensive but unuser-friendly,This book is an eye-catcher for any professor. It is very comprehensive and breaks down things which seem very logical to someone who already knows French. As a student of French I found this book to be difficult. Consequently I used other books to learn French. Then I referred to this book to get a more comprehensive understanding. This book has some pretty good exercises.
1,echo - don't you dare,TV burnt out in 6 months. No help from APEX for producing this dfective product.
1,Piece of Crap!,"I guess I was lucky in that my Apex tv actually survived through a cross-country move and made it to about the year and a half mark before it started having problems. Now the tv constantly acts as if the Volume Up button is being pushed, so the volume is stuck at max all the time and the volume bar is constantly visible at the bottom of the screen. This makes it so that the tv is too loud to watch and the volume bar blocks everything in the bottom quarter of the screen. To top it off, repairs would cost more than I paid for the stupid thing!"
4,Touchdown,"There's a good reason that Sports Illustrated included this book in its list of the Greatest Sports Books ever: it's a good book. And the movie version is far tamer than the book, and compared to the book, the movie has an upbeat ending.North Dallas Forty, an thinly-veiled insider view of the Dallas Cowboys of the late-1960s. Written by a former Cowboys' wide receiver, the book takes you inside a football franchise struggling to stay on top. After reading the book, your body aches -- you know what it feels to be drilled in the ribs while running over the middle.Watch the team and the NFL go out of the way to protect the stars while throwing aside those pawns that make the greats great. Read this book and become disgusted by the NFL, the owners, the coaches, and the entire league apparatus, but glory in the sheer talent and determination of the players doing the only thing that they know how to do."
4,Great Story....physically flawed book,"I bought this 30th annivesary ""Hall of Fame Edition"", and I just finished reading it. I thought it was weird that the first chapter and last chapter were identical. I didn't find out until just now, that my book was misprinted. Chapter 1 in the book, was NOT the same as Chapter 1 (Monday) in the ""Look Inside"" that's linked above.That aside, I really liked the book. I don't think I missed too much without the first chapter. I've never seen the movie, that's next on my list.Chapter 7 (Sunday) was a really GREAT chapter about a football game, really made me feel like I was IN THE GAME!Go ahead, read the book. But, be wary of the ""Hall of Fame Edition"""
3,Very good football story with a downer of an ending,Very good story just don't read the last 10 pages. An inside view of the pro football that shows the business side of the game.
1,hugely disappointing,"this is the most significant rip-off i have seen in years on amazon - and i buy a lot here. i have never returned an item, but these woodlore premium hangars are a huge disappointment. of the 12 hangars ordered 1 was broken due to pathetic packaging (no cushion?!) and all of the hangars were poorly manufactured - some had splinters, some showed the screws of the cross bar. the cross bar itself has the quality of something you find in a dollar store. you almost wonder whether the cedar color is artificial and eventually stains your suits. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!! (and i do not say this lightly; have never written a negative review before)."
2,Better price than other vendors for flawed product,"Though the price was better at Amazon than on any other on-line site, this hanger is quite disappointing. The pants bar is rough to the point of needing to be covered to prevent damaging contact with jackets or pants and the item does not have any scent of cedar to it. Overall, the hanger is too rough to the touch and sloppily assembled (splinters and imprecise joining)for the purpose intended or price paid. Sorry, but cannot recommend."
1,we want made in usa,when will these companys start selling items made in usa .i will NOT BUY any more things not usa made.
3,just getting started,"nice book,would of like all color pictures to hard to see detail when in black and white,also was hoping for more info on the dates of lamps and ceiling fixtures"
5,Realistic story of Central American refugees journey,"It would be difficult to have a hard heart toward refugees after reading ""Grab Hands and Run"". This book is so well written. Every step along their journey has potential problems and dangers in it, yet somehow they make it from El Salvador to Canada. This book deepened my gratitude for the safety of my own home and the strength of our American democracy. This would be a timely book for children to read, knowing that many people will flee Honduras and Guatamala in the aftermath of Hurricane Mitch."
5,Exactly what I needed.,"Exactly as advertised, and immediately made a difference, cleared the codes I was still getting on this car. The packaging was not excessive. This was all around a great purchase."
1,CRAP,My son used it for a very short time and it broke. It looks better than it plays. This is truly just a toy.
4,Ahead Of The (His) Game,"Ellis Clark's song writing was way ahead of it's time. Where artist such as the Killers and Coldplay becoming popular in the 2000's Ellis Clark was even more creative in the mid-90's. Chicago was fortunate enough to get familiar with him, too bad the rest of the world has yet to do so. Uncle Sam Shot Ms. America is easily one of the most well written tracks I have ever heard."
3,A frenchman's short struggle with the country at his feet,"I stumbled upon this book while looking for more reading on John Steinbeck. This easy read is short and charming. Pippin finds himself suddenly crowned as king after France decides to resort to monarchy. His country does well by him, and eagerly accepts him until he attempts to actually use his power. Not quite ""Of Mice and Men"" or ""The Grapes of Wrath,"" but an unusual look at the French Revolution turned upside down."
2,Probably his most disappointing work,"I have read all but two of the books by Steinbeck that were published. The Short Reign of Pippin IV is by far my least favorite. There is, in my opinion, a decided stylistic shift in Steinbeck's writing following the war, and his books became increasingly bourgeois. This book is the pinnacle of this shift. I had a very difficult time reading this book, and actually had to put it aside at one point out of disappointment and frustration."
3,"It had a good political comedy, and was easy to understand.",It is a book about a man named Pippin who lives in France and has to be king because the French government forces him to.
1,disappointed,I was so disappointed in this book. I had been looking forward to its release. I have read all of Joan Elizabeth Lloyd's books and have always enjoyed them. The sex was cold and rehearsed. There was no variety at all. I felt I had read the story line before in one of her other books.
2,"Smells heavenly, but left me dry and itchy","This soap gets one star for the awesome herbal smell. Another star is for the amount of suds the bar produces, with just a couple of swipes. However, after one use my skin was left so itchy that I finally had to get undressed and smother my skin with lotion from head to toe! My facial skin was so tight that I could see every wrinkle! Even when applying the soap in the shower it burned my facial skin (but not body) and my face was left reddened for hours after application. I do have acne-prone sensitive skin, and think this bar would be more beneficial to normal or oily skin types. I wish the soap would have worked for me, too."
2,Smells terrible and burns,"First off I have very sensitive skin. When a friend recommended this soap to me I thought it would be worth a try. I give it 2 stars because while it definitely cleaned my skin it left it dry, red, and very irritated. It took almost an hour and a lot of moisturizer to get rid of the burning. Aside from that the soap smells absolutely terrible. The best description I can give it is patchouli mixed with every god awful incense you can think of. I'm just glad I didn't try this stuff after shaving."
5,Fun and Educational Product,"This is such a great product. I bought this for my 4-year-old niece. She is learning to spell and she love arts and crafts. She loves them to use these and her parents love them because it shows her the correct placement of letters on kindergarten paper.I am also a special education teacher and can't wait to oder some for my classroom. I have worked with a few students who struggle with the fine motor skill of writing and it is holding them back in learning to spell. This would definitely help! It is unlike anything I have ever seen: they are clear so the students work on correct spacing, the rubber is only on the letter so there is no ink box around the letter, and punctuation marks (period, comma, question mark, and exclamation mark) are included for sentence creation."
5,Easy to use and kids love.,I use this for Daily 5 word work. My students love them. I teach second grade and they still have issues remembering proper capitalization. I like that these are lowercase for practicing sight words.
5,Excellent!,"Excellent book. Well written and refreshingly different. The author brings Regency London alive. Both Nicholas and Sarah are strong characters and Sarah is no simpering Miss, but a vital, intelligent woman who is a good match for Nicholas. Julia Justiss draws an excellent villain, as well. Hard to believe this is Justiss's first book. I'm looking forward to her future ones."
2,This book is not worth the money,"This book shows many cases, gives rarity & tell who madethe cases. There is almost no text at all in this book, it isbasically a picture book. The book is lacking in information on the different companies that made cases & on when the cases were made. For those who do not know about the cases a company name is not helpful without the company background. Without the time they were made they are not helpful in dating the images they hold. The book is lacking in that it does not show a single top folding case from the early years of photography c1839 to 1842/43. You would be better off getting the books 'Union Cases' by Krainik & Walvoord & 'American Minature Case Art' by Rinhart. The two books I recommend give more information on the cases & are not just a bunch of pretty pictures. Do not waste your money."
1,Beware of Non-Original Recordings,"Tracks ""Feels so Good"" and ""Give It All You Got"" are not the original recordings, they are inferior (of course) re-workings. Stick with previous CD releases."
4,"Really good, but not worth the money!","If you already have the songs Don't Tell It's Over and Mother's Day, which you should have First Date, and you know you've seen The Rock Show video, then it's not worth the money you're paying, like me. But I'm a hardcore Blink fan so I got it, and even though I have already heard all these songs, and seen the video, I wasn't disapointed. It was good, this is the better way to get the songs Mother's Day and Don't Tell Me It's Over because there both on two different TOYPAJ'S. So, get this instead if you haven't heard those 2 songs because it's worth it!!!"
1,"Ahistorical, poorly acted, poorly staged","If you want an ahistorical film of Cleopatra get the Taylor-Burton version from the the 50s- the color is better. This one sucks, I have nothing good to say about it."
3,"Watch it for Billy Zane, but read the book","Leonor (sp?) Varela's acting was pretty excruciating at the beginning but I got used to it (or she got better) as the film went on. she certainly did look the part of an Egyptian queen, I will give her that. I am not a big fan of Dalton's - I think Caeser could have been cast better but Billly Zane as Marc Antony ... ooh la la!The sets and costuming are also breathtaking.Margerat George's books are fabulous - read the book for the better story and if there are any directors out there, don't make the books for TV anymore - make them a real movie and spend the money to get talent."
1,The Worst Cleopatra Movie,"The acting was terrible and beside good looking actors/actresses, there was nothing to hope for this movie. Do not buy the movie, just rent it."
1,Disappointment of the Nile,"Because the magnificent Billy Zane was in this movie, I didn't think I would have to expect too much from this crock--now I do. What's sad about this film is that (a horribly untalented) Leonor Varela makes the great and beautiful Cleopatra look like a street whore, and when the scene for the overthrow of Egypt occurs, it seems over inadequate to see her begin to say something intelligent (also, the script is terrible and unrealistic). Timothy Dalton was good, but not for this role: I couldn't see him as Caesar. Billy Zane, although his acting was lovely, it was overdone and hammy. The sets and musical score are beautiful, but it just goes downhill from there-you'd wish it was a silent film! I wouldn't purchase this movie if it were FREE! Don't waste your money (Go see the Elizabeth Taylor version--she can actually act!)."
5,"two thumbs up, informative and entertaining!!!",This movie was so interesting and much better since i saw the movie before reading the book. The movies are always disappointing compared to the book. Since they only had a few hours they did a really good job and Timothy Dalton and Billy Zane are fine! They make it worth it. I recomend this movie to anyone who likes an interesting story with good acting.
1,Read the book instead,"20 minutes into this movie I was disgusted by the terrible acting and the complete disregard for the book on which is it supposedly based. The actress playing Cleopatra protrays her as petulent, spoiled and immature, whereas in the book one saw Cleopatra as highly astute, regal, and concerned first about her country and its people. In the movie she handed Egypt to Ceasar eagerly, whereas in the book she refused to surrender anything to Rome. Likewise, Dalton portrays Ceasar as a complete ****.Perhaps if this were not based on Margaret George's Memiors of Cleopatra, I would be more kind in my review, but it pains me to think of the years of research wasted because of some second-rate film-maker's idea of good story-telling.At 975 pages the book may be too meaty for most, but if you really want to learn about this queen, read the book instead."
3,"This Cleopatra is more soap, than true history","I found watching this version to be too much of a soap opera, than a great victory between Egypt and Rome. Timothy Dalton played a worthy Caesar and was made for the role. Billy Zane made a perfect model for Antony, but his character did not amount to much. For instances, getting drunk and showing so little valor. Leonor Valera made an alright Cleopatra, but she was so childish and was so much a drama queen, than a true potrayal of Cleopatra. Too many disputes and bombastic arguements make the history and story so unreal. And the fleet of ships looked like they were computerized. I did not like that. This film needed some fixing up."
2,Glamorized look at Cleopatra VII,"As a lover of ancient history, I was excited to watch yet ANOTHER film on the life of Cleopatra. This film is extremely glamourous, and seems as if it follows the script of an ancient soap opera rather than the life of the last queen of ancient Egypt. The filmmakers obviously didn't create this to be a factual account of Cleo's life. The acting by Billy Zane (Antony) and Timothy Dalton (Caesar) was very good, and Lenor Varella (Cleopatra) provides a good show, if you like passion and overdone drama. If you want to see a fictionalized and modern televison view of Cleopatra's life, than this is your movie, but the Cleopatra movie starring Elizabeth Taylor is far superior."
3,A definite NO for kids,"The story of Cleopatra is one full of adventure, romance and killing, unfortunately this video shows those things too well. We got this video in hopes it would be educational and entertaining but the results we found were slightly different. The movie contains graphic killing, brief nudity and unappropriate situations. The movie however, is one that was very well made. I just wish they could have rated it and not left it to the viewer's discretion. In my rating system this movie would be between PG-13 and R. This movie is excellent, but just has a few flaws. So if kids are going to watch this make sure they have extreme parental guidance."
5,the most amazing interpretation of the story of Cleopatra...,"I don't think I've ever read or seen a better version of the life of the most erotic queen of egypt. this movie not only told me the story of cleopatra, but sucked me into the past and as i watched it, i felt like i was the great queen herself. Leonor Varela portrayes Cleopatra like no other woman (except MAYBE Liz Taylor) can, and Tim Dalton displays top notch acting ability. combined with Billy Zane, this movie is sure to fulfill your crave for the most infamous queen of the nile ever."
1,Boooooooooooooring,"I did not see this on tv, but rather on DVD. I found it very difficult to follow, with only Rupert Graves and Billy Zane giving any sort of worthwhile performances."
3,"Good for entertainment, an enjoyable movie","I bought this movie for my 12 year old, her history class and her personal fascination with Cleo. I wasn't familar with Ancient history. I feel this is a good version of Cleo., Cesear, and Anthony. Maybe it leaves some things out, but its not a historical documentary, its a movie. I enjoyed it and it will hold my daughter's interest to continue in school work. These reviews don't address this possibility, and this movie serves this purpose well. I don't feel that its in the same class with Gone with the Wind, but it wasn't a waste of money either. Good entertainment on many levels. Romance really clicks, stratedy makes your brain work, plot has things that happens. Not a dull movie."
4,"The sets were eye-candy, but historical accuracy???","I gave this movie 4 stars because of the elaborte sets and costumes. It was a great movie as far as a televistion mini-series goes and it held my interest, however, it was severely lacking historical accuracy. I was a bit disappointed that they did not mention, nor show Cleopatra's children with Marc Antony. Over all, it was a good movie and I will probably buy the video when it is released."
2,"Not historical, seems like lots of scenes are missing","I saw this movie on TV. I thought the costumes and scenerey were great but chunks of history were cut out when they made the movie. I recommend that you read the book it was based on, The Memoirs of Cleopatra by Margret George. It is much better, and captures the truth of Cleopatra as closely as possible."
1,CHEAP!,"In a made-for-Tv miniseries, you sort of expect shabby special-effects, and less than stellar acting, but this one sinks to new lows. Even with credible actors such as Dalton and Zane, ALL the performances here ranged from wooden (Dalton and Zane) to plain awful (Valera). A lot of this I suspect was due to lousy directing coupled with a cartoon of a script. The costumes look like something from a high-school production, and the sets are possibly the worst ever assembled for a period piece. Everything looks like cardboard cut-outs. Save your money."
3,Cleopatra,"The problem with this film, no matter how good the cast is your using, you can't tell an epic story of this magnitude on the small screen! You have the weight of Burton and Taylor on your shoulders in one of MGM's biggest ever productions and your gonna sink if it's done for a cable release before you have even got started. The effects to make it look like they are in Egypt just hamm the whole thing up, and as a result the story is mainly told from tiny sets. Dalton as ever pulls out the stops no matter where he is and he has a good supporting cast to help him do it! However if you don't have the proper financial and production backing, don't mess with epic tales!!"
2,It was OK,"It was ok except some parts were cut out of the movie from the end. I saw the whole movie, but parts were missing from the video. If you want swiss cheese, look here."
2,A beautiful Film poorly acted,"I loved this movie. The costumes were beautiful and the acting was excellent. Maybe not always 100% accurate but that's Hollywood. Unless its a documentary, there's no real need to be nitpicky about historical inaccuracies. Movies are made for entertainment. And this one definitely does that. My only criticism is the acting is really second-rate. Cleopatra comes across as a whiny spoiled brat who would cause a scene if things weren't done according to her wishes. If the real Cleopatra was truly this childish I'm not surprised Octavius defeated her."
4,Good Deal,"This truly is an excellent film. Great acting, battle scenes and quality of filming. It is well-written and depicts a good version of Cleopatra's life."
2,"Nice Scenery, Too Bad About The Cast","The lush scenery and costuming used in this production makes it worthwhile to rent. The choice of Lenora Valera as Cleopatra, however, I had a real problem with. It was widely known that Cleopatra was not only Greek, but not particularly beautiful. It was her voice which mesmerized. I think HBO's Rome Series did a fantastic job in casting for Cleopatra. By casting Lenora Valera for the part, the directors chose to make an unrealistic ""sexy"" portrayal of an ancient story which doesn't need any ""Sexing"" up from Hollywood."
3,Cleopatra and all of her mystique,"It is clear that this film was done for entertaining the network viewer. Beautiful costumes and elaborate settings were the marque of this television event. However, the diologe of Cleopatra herself was lacking. Her words were comanding and childish, and did not exhibit her to be a manipulator, or even a charming temptress of men that she was expected to be. The writing showed her to be a constantly love-sick girl, forever at the mercy of Roman men, rather than a stong leader of Egypt. Although it is a bit difficult to convey her true character over only two-evening specials, it is clear that the historic nature of this pharoah was ignored, and it was broadcast purely for costume and setting design."
1,worst,How these movies were made amazes me. How they were put in a collection that they think people would buy amazes me even more. This is absolutely the worst collection of DVDs ever. Each movie is a new kind of horrible. Each one is worse than the next. Don't waste your time.
2,"For Insomniacs, A Rainy Day Off From Work or Timothy Dalton Fans","The 2 stars are for Timothy Dalton. Honestly, he was the only reason I was able to watch this film. Pure eye candy. As a chick flick, the film failed even in terms of wardrobe. What was with the ugly serpent headpiece Cleo wore through the film? The actress playing Cleopatra portrayed her not as a queen of a nation, but a rich girl with nothing to do but make trouble for family members and sleep around with important men. The worst scene is when Cleo actually asks Ceasar ""Do you love me?"" I expected her to start doing his laundry or making meals for him in the next scene. The other members of the royal family were equally laughable, especially the rotund general/advisor of brother Ptolomey. Please do not spend any money on this film. The writers are truly the culprits of this film. Wait until a baseball game gets rained out and the film gets scheduled as a filler. Unless, of course, you simply can not get enough of Timothy Dalton."
1,Gimme a break,"I made it through about half of this movie before I ejected it and went to the video store to rent the Elizabeth Taylor version. If you like history, you'll find this movie a big disappointment. Cleopatra was not the bimbo this movie makes her out to be."
5,Performance,"Cleoptra with Billy Zane is one of the best performances i've seen in a long time. If a movie holds my attention, it's good. Timothy Dalton was magnificent in his role. His role as Ceaser was powerful,yet it showed that his heart could be won over by Love. Leonor Varela was awesome as Cleopatra. Her acting was awesome. To me, the best of the movie was at the end. The way she cheated her enemy from death by taking her own life was great. This is one of the best versions of Cleopatra since Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor."
4,Heroes is Excellence,"This game is a truly excellent. If you want fun with magic or just pure creature strength, this is your game! BUY IT!!"
4,"Great Game, but Not Challenging","Heroes III is an improvement with respect to everything except its artificial intelligence. It seems to me that the AI could not keep up with the other advances. Consequently, the campaigns were much easier than they were in Heroes II Gold. The concept of carrying some of your best heroes from one level to the next in the campaigns makes the game too easy. In particular, I finished the last level of one of the campaigns within a ridiculously short period of time because I had too many powerful spells, such as the ""fly"" spell. The game is still tons of fun, but Heroes II Gold is much more difficult, so I actually gave my copy of Heroes III to somebody else when I finished it. However, I still play Heroes II Gold."
3,A great game for beginners,"It is great for those new playing computer games. It is a turn-based strategy game(meaning you take a turn then your opponent takes their turns). there is more than enough scenarios to keep you playing this games for two years. Another plus to the game is that it is very simple to play, you can do everything with your mouse. If you like a lot of action and movies in your games, then this is not the game for you. Even without all of the fancy stuff the game is still challenging and entertaining. I recommend this to anyone whose never played a computer game before and has lots of time to waste."
3,Descently Good,"Heroes III: Complete is a pretty good game.If you are looking for a good game with good,fast graphicsThen this isn't the game for you, but if you are looking for a strategy game with mystical creatures and the sort, I would reccomend this game for you. This game is kinda like Lords Of Magic. Only it isn't as boring."
2,Not really a games person,Not being a games person I found this game to hard to feel like a winner. The rules are not clear or easy to discover for a beginner.
5,Differences of versions,"I haven't played this game in a while, but it is great. Does the 95/98 version from 3DO work on XP as well as the XP version from Ubisoft? [...] price difference, so just wondering. Thanks."
5,THE BEST GAME EVER !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Heros of Might and Magic 3 is one of the best games i have ever played..... Excuse me I beg your pardon, IT IS THE BEST GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED. ok now that that is over, I dont actually have the game but I'm getting it for my birthday. My best friend in the world opened me up to the amazing world of Heros3 complete. last year at another friends New Years party we all took turns on the multyplayer option, I wasn't very interested in it then but BOY DID I MISS OUT, then Chris got it and ever since then I've been hooked. thankyou so much for making this game. I owe you one, both my friend and the company that made the game"
4,"Great game, but one annoying drawback","I bought this game thinking that because this is the complete version, I could play over the internet with a friend who has Shadows of Death. Not so. They are incompatible, so now my friend must buy this version as well. It would have been nice to see this printed on the box somewhere.I love playing the game though (albeit on my own)."
5,One of the best computer games I've ever played,"My short list of best computer games I've ever played:SimsHeroes IIIRoller Coaster TycoonI am a 19 year old female who doesn't usually enjoy fighting games, but i do like fantasy. My only complaint for this game is that you need someone's IP address (or vice versa) to do multiplayer, and I've never quite been able to connect and play with someone over the internet. (I always get a message saying it can't connect) Maybe I'm just missing something obvious. But, I have enjoyed countless hours of fun with this game. its a great game to play with a friend or two, or three :) . this is a WONDERFUL strategy game, and has various difficulty levels (great for someone like me who doesnt want to deal with expert level, but doesnt always want it to be too easy). This game is well worth any money I paid for it. I have been playing this game for about four years now, and I still love it. Buy it!! :)"
5,Second time around better than the first.,"I picked this book up again yesterday having read it several years ago. I just finished a few moments ago and felt compelled to leave this review.This book is a true delight. To those of us who have the low country in our blood, this book captures it all. I loved it even more the second time around. And even knowing about the tragedies that Mrs. Peterkin has endured I still cried. She is such a fine example of the indomitable southern woman or I guess I should say ""Lady"". I truly hope that one day I will have the distinct pleasure of meeting her.My only regret is the book just ends too soon and too fast. I wish there were a sequel, I would love to know what she has been up to. And I would so dearly love a print of the watercolor that is on the front of the book."
4,A local's fav,Loved reading a book with so much local history. If you live in the Waccamaw Neck you will enjoy this book!
2,Dictionary?,"I ordered this for our new Brazilian au pair thinking it was a quick reference dictionary. It's this rather large picture book, that didn't really look like a dictionary! Had to return it."
5,"A Good Companion Book For ""The Golden Dawn Tarot Deck""","This book was illustrated with and created by the creator of ""The Golden Dawn Tarot Deck, Robert Wang."" It a wonderful book for both the beginner and the pros. It a companion book for the Golden Dawn deck therefore makes the imagery compatible. A must for ""Golden Dawn Tarot Deck by Robert Wang"""
1,worthless waste of money,"i bought this to make backup copies of DVDs that i burned from my TV and though it did copy the disk it made it impossible to use any of the features that my DVD player offers (like fast forward, rewind, skip chapter, renaming the file, etc) and the copies seemed to only be the first five minutes or so of the TV show, even though it said on the menu that the whole show was there (45 minutes). it would play up to a certain point (like the first chapter of a show) and then freeze. it wouldn't return to the menu. it wouldn't do anything. it just stayed frozen no matter what button i pressed. i had to unplug my DVD player to make it stop. as far as i can tell this product is a worthless waste of money."
1,Garbage,"This is the worse software ever. I only wanted to copy a family video to another dvd. No user support, no online or printed help. The box it came in is more useful. I had to rate it one star but it was not even worth that rating."
1,junk,Useless product. I've tried it on two different computers without any luck. It won't copy any of the DVD's that I tried. Wasted 5 DVD + R DL media so far. I've talked to support services and they were useless.
1,does not work - don't waste your time,"I rip DVDs on my PC so I can watch movies on the airplane. This software takes a long time, and requires multiple steps (first about an hour to pre-process a file, then select output format then another hour or so to convert) instead of one click - so no overnight copy/convert process. It did create output files - one in DVD copy format, and another in MPEG format (I had to try different methods since the first one did not work) - neither worked. My PC was unable to play neither file - about 3 hours I will never get back. I am returning it."
1,A Complete Waste of Money,"I've tried several of the free downloads of DVD copying software until one of them infected my laptop with 19 Trojan viruses. After doing a fix, I vowed never to download this stuff again and go ahead and pay the 50 bucks for the real stuff, and boy, did I pick a loser. Nothing worked. 123 DVD Copy Gold not only doesn't copy and burn DVDs, it doesn't even burn DVD files stored on my external hard drive. I emailed the company, describing the problems I was having, and never received a reply. I tried everything, disabling my firewall, uninstalling/reinstalling, etc, to no avail. I plan on buying 1 Click DVD next, as their reviews and ratings are very good to excellent. Don't fall for this junk. Save your money and look for something else."
1,"absolute nightmare, avoid at all costs","First of all, there are NO instructions anywhere on how to use this product. No matter how hard you try, with any DVD, copied from any other source, you will constantly hit a wall that says there is an error and you will not be able to duplicate a DVD. This is an absolute nightmare of incompetence and an out and out con. Look at the ratings for this product and DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!"
1,123 Junk!,"This might be the worst software I've ever used. I was foolish enought to buy it twice. The first time I did it worked great for about two weeks and then it went on the blink. I tried to uninstall and re-install but with no luck. A year or so later I bough it again and this time it would not work out of the book. Want to try customer support help, you can forget it. This is a awful product and the company needs to stop putting it on the market. Everone who has ever used this product need to let folks know not to buy it. SAVE YOUR MONEY!!"
1,useless junk,"Won't even burn a video that you have saved in a file. Save your money. fyi: I do know more about computers than the average user. There are much better programs out there - dvdfab, Nero."
2,Frustrating more often than not,"I have been using this software to create video files from my owned videos to my Zune. Apparently, Acorn media stuff will not work. I have tried downloading the entire disk then converting also, but still no luck. I have found some work arounds in a few cases, but never with Acorn media items. Despite the problems, I have been able to create several video files and put them on the Zune as long as they were not Acorn. Still, it is very time consuming for someone no too technically oriented (like me). I have several series of new videos I would like to store as Mpeg4 files for travel use, but several of them will not work. By coincidence, they are all Acorn media related items. I never thought to consider who is behind the recorded product before, but now I will avoid anything from Acorn. In summary, I have had a mix of success and frustration, but the frustration seems to lurk at the end of the day..."
4,"If you have children or are planning on having them, read it","I have been studying vitamins and natural remedies for quite a while now and I think I have a pretty good general knowledge on the subject. I am a new mom and I recently got this book from a friend. It's REALLY GOOD, very helpful hints on how to adjust the children's diet to what he really needs without forcing him to eat what he doesn't like. It also has very easy to understand data on why vitamins are so important for our body. I recommend it to any parent, future or expecting parent and aspiring parent."
3,Haven't even unpacked all of it,"I just received it today and noticed they left out the grate. It does not come with it. So better order it also if you want. I look forward to lighting it up. 10/15/08 have it all put together now and there are no defects of any kind as of now. Putting together the required venting maybe tricky since I have not a one Ace Hardware, or a Lowe's, or Home Depot that has the necessary parts to complete the installation I will need to go on-line to find that. I will fill you in as I go. But I Love the looks of this stove in my home, COOL."
3,Very good for the price.,For the price the stove is OK. It needs to be finished correctly after you assemble it. I have not road tested the stove yet. Got it for my sun room.
1,poor customer service,"the details of product are misleading,the piping does is not included and are hard to find. Staff was not helpful in finding required accessories.I am dissatified with product."
1,"Too bad there's no ""zero star"" rating","This is a dumb-sized book that tries to cash in on the popularity of the Alien and Predator movies. Nothing new : go watch the movies instead! No original thought and no really good SF concepts. More for a 13-year-old. Not a very bright 13-year-old, for that matter."
5,Awesome gumball machine!,My daughter just loves this gumball machine! She loves putting the balls into the machine and has learned how to push the lever so that her balls come out of the bottom- then she happily places them back into the machine. This toy occupies her for a pretty long time for a toddler. Plus she likes all of the cute things inside each ball.
2,fun the first few times,"My daughter is now 10 months old. I gave her this toy at 8 months. She used it 2-3 times and since could care less about it. I think she may be too young for it. She tries to put the balls into the bottom even though I keep showing her how to use it. As far as educational.... Cause and effect is where I would say the education comes in, then there is colors but that's about it. As far as durable..its burable but I truly wish it didn't tip so easily. Cute toy over all."
3,"Cute, but not the best","We received this toy as a gift. It's very cute. The tunes are short and fun (not obnoxious).I find my 9 month old does not have interest in it. Plus the balls are always missing (they roll right out, and on a hard wood floor, they are constantly missing). In fact, I have not seen all the balls since the day we opened the packaging.I like the peek-a-blocks much better."
4,Great interactive toy,"First off, do not buy this toy here. I just bought this from Toys R Us for $23.99. I went to find my 16 month old daughter a new toy to play with. She isn't impressed with the ""push a button and lights flash"" toys. She likes interactive toys that require a little challenge. I saw this toy on the shelf and as soon as I pulled it off the shelf she immediately started reaching for it. She started turning the little knob in the front and I thought ""SOLD!"". We got home and she couldn't wait for me to take it out of the packaging. She immediately begun playing with it. She loves that she can put the balls in the top, push the little lever, and they roll out the bottom. So overall I'm pretty satisfied with this toy. I don't think it's the best toy ever, but it's pretty good :o)"
4,"I don't understand it, but my babies love it!","We got this in 2005 for our first son. It was the first toy he really played with and learning to push down the lever to make the gumball come out was the first deliberate motor skill he showed while playing. It took longer to get him to learn to put the gumballs back in, so we needed to play with it with him to re-load it for him. For months he played with this. Now our second son is playing with it, and again, it was the first toy I really saw him action a new and deliberate skill with while playing. Neither child really ever used the yellow clicking turn lever on the front. It has stood up well to being knocked down over and over again, having foreign objects stuffed in it and then knocked back out. We purchased other sets of the roll arounds balls and were able to get a lot of play out of this toy with all of the extra balls too, which I recommend. For the price and 3 years and 2 babies, I am very happy with this purchase."
5,Gumball fun for everyone!,"I first saw this toy on the FisherPrice website a couple months before Christmas and knew I wanted it for my daughter. While in Babies R Us I picked it up and let her play with it and it was a hit!This is a cute toy that simulates a gumball machine. There are clear balls that have items inside that you would find in a vending machine, a lollipop, a ring, hard candy and a toy. When you press a lever the toys swirl to the bottom and out the hole while a happy tune and lights play. The tune is short and not annoying. The toy works also without the sound on in case you have had enough sound.The teaching of cause and effect, put in and take play and the balls themselves are great. I really like these balls better than the ""Peekablocks"". They are easier to handle and are slightly bigger inside so the contents of the balls are in my opinion cuter.Everyone that see's this toy whether adult or child stops to play with it. A great addition for your toybox!"
5,One of the best baby toys out there!!,"My older daughter had this toy and absolutely loved it as a baby, so I just HAD to buy it again for our 5-month-old! She loves pressing the lever and watching the ball come out of the bottom! She does knock it over occasionally when she's sitting up next to it, but it's not a bother to pick the gumball machine back up each time because I'm usually sitting on the floor with her. She enjoys the music and pressing the lever over and over, the toy is fun and educational. When she's trying to flip over during a diaper change, I set this next to her and she'll reach up to pull the lever, so it makes diaper changes easier, too!If you're reading the reviews and debating on whether to buy it or not, definitely buy it! This is a MUST HAVE toy for all babies!"
2,I loved it by neither of my daughters did...,"I thought this looked like such a fun toy, but neither one of my daughters ever played with it! I would show them that it lit up and the noises, etc - but nothing. They did like the peek-a-boo balls, but they never got into the machine itself. The Big Cube is a much better purchase!"
5,Great toy,I bought this for my daughter about a month ago and she quickly figured out how to get the gumballs to roll out. She was trying to play with it before I even got it out of it's box in fact. She loves to make all the balls come out at once instead of waiting for the music to finish but that's ok. She loves anything that lights up and since we live in a small town with only a Walmart to buy toys at these kind of toys are hard to find. She especially loves the ball with the smaller balls inside (she's also obsessed with rattles). This toy is very durable so far and I love it. Fisher Price makes some of the best toys around and I love the Peek a Blocks concept and now the Peek a Balls.
5,Extra Balls At Target,"Hi, my son just got this toy for his birthday yesterday and we realized that Grandma bought it at Costco and it came with 10 balls instead of the just the original 4. My son loves it!!! We opened it first, and he had no interest in opening any of his other gifts after seeing this!!!!"
2,Interactive but not much of activity ..,This toy used to engage my baby about a 15 minutes or so..He played with it in his early phase of 1st year(around his 6th month-8thmonth)..and babies are very intelligent in understanding thefirst in first out surprise of this gumball..This product ENHANCES MEMORY part of the kids!The make is excellent. Colors are bright.
4,Great toy for 6-18 months!!!!,"I BOUGHT THIS TOY AT A GARAGE SALE FOR TWO DOLLARS! MY DAUGHTER LOVED THIS FROM 6-18 MONTHS BUT IS IT IS TOO BASIC NOW. SHE REALLY LOVED IT AROUND 12 MONTHS! I THINK IT IS DURABLE, FUN AND EDUCATIONAL. GREAT BUY FOR A BABY!"
5,My 26 months old son likes it !!,"When I looked up the customer review before I bought the product, mostly it was bought for baby/toddler younger than 24 months. I wondered if my 26 months old son would like it or not. It turned out he enjoys it in a different ways to younger babies do. These are the things he does with the toy :-1) Puts the balls in, pressed the level and then look into the opening to see how the actions take place.2) Fills up as much balls as he could (we have set of 6 balls from previous christmas) and then roll them out as quick as he can3) Presses the level and listen to the music, laughing hysterically at the funny tune4) Sits on the toy as a stool5) Plays with the box the toy came with6) Puts in all sorts of objects other than his balls - toy cars, toy trains, food, etc."
5,Keep finding new ways to play with it.,We got this toy as a Christmas present when our son was three months old. He is now a year and is still enchanted with it. We originally used to have him watch it to hold his attention during tummy time. His interaction with it has increased as his motor skills developed. He loves the gumball machine and the balls work as a separate toy since they are a great size for little hands and bang together very well. I highly recommend this product.
4,Fun but be Careful,My 7 month old daughter LOVES this toy but she did get injured playing with it. The yellow lever on the front of the toy is hollow and she got her finger stuck behind the lever and managed to turn it with the other hand and got her finger and hand stuck in the toy. I called Fisher Price and they want me to mail the toy back and they will send me a refund but my daughter really loves this toy so for now I stuffed the hollow part with some tissues. Just be careful and don't leave your child unattended with this toy!
1,Do not buy!,"Horrible quality of the films, like it was taken from VHS that has sat in the sun for a week!"

4,Eclectic Power Rock Paradise,"With its daring time changes, virtuoso guitar solos, and surreal lyrics, Dimes' premier CD pounds through your speakers like the soundtrack to some midnight cult movie you've heard about, but were always a little too afraid to see. Braver listeners will be amply rewarded by this underground San Francisco band's ambitious compositions, fever dream melodies, and Lynchian sense of humor. Highly recommended."
4,Patti LaBelle,"GOOD STUFF . . .A kind of a sampling . . .""If Only you Knew . . .and I'm in Love Again""are NOW Certified Classics . . ."
2,A good idea with faulty base,"This gauge is great for visibility when it is about 10feet away from your back yard window, but make sure to place it near a tree trunk or pole, as the base is NOT sturdy at all.If you have hard ground, it will not easily push into it for a stable season, and will not last a second if you have kids running around the yard.Only get it if you want to mount it on something using your own ingenuity!It would be a much better product if the base was made of metal.Brent"
2,Should have listened...,"I bought this as a gift exchange gag gift item (the theme was weather related). The person who got the gift liked it at first, but they also complained about its design.Live and learn."
3,Lynch Families of The Southern States,"Overall the author did a good job on this.It does not give as much information as I would have liked to have as the book traces the lineage of the authors ancestor.It only covers a handfull of states,Mississippi,Kentucky,Texas,North & South Carolina and a couple of others.It also includes many letter excerpts that the author received from people she wrote to about certain Lynch family members. The only way to know for sure if your lineage is in the book is to make the purchase and check ."
1,When Good Authors Go Bad,"This text is a nightmare... The authors' PowerPoint 2000 text would have to be given 4 or 5 stars. Beginning with chapter 2 the steps in the various instruction sets provided do not map well to the PowerPoint screen. The reader is left to make extensive use of the software's help system.I am MOUS certified in PowerPoint 2000 and am attempting the newly-named Microsoft certification in PowerPoint 2002... I was disappointed in this text--- I would recommend highly these authors' texts in Word 2000, Word 2002, and PowerPoint 2000.The New Perspectives Series,in general, are superior to the Shelly-Cashman Texts.... but not in this case. Thomson Learning publishes both and has added a third series of texts.It is obvious that the exercises were not worked through thoroughly by the authors--- otherwise these errors would have been caught"
5,Great for hardwood floors,"We have about 300 square feet of hardwood floor space and another 200 square feet of linoleum and this mop works great. It's fast and we have 2 dogs (that shed). Works well dry but spraying the mop lightly with hardwood floor cleaner makes everything stick.The only complaint is that you will want 4 or 5 mop head refills because we wash the dirty mop heads with other ""rag"" type laundry and it's tough to get a full load.I would recommend this mop."
3,Okay - not the best,"After Lowe's stopped carrying the refills I found these online. They are OK, but not as thick or absorbant as the ones I bought in store. Don't know if they are the same brand. Also noticed that 2 of the 3 I bought online are really hard to stretch over the mop base; they seem a little small."
5,Excellent tips for all computer users,"Excellent tips for all computer usersYou must read this book if you:- need protected Internet- need cool Windows- think different :)This book describes the innards of the Windows operation system, as wellas some intristing methods for configuring bothit and the computer. This book describes hacking method, stealing data or monitoring a computer."
2,Great Game,"This game is very fun and exciting that you want to own the next game so you can find out what happens next. If you want it you should get it, this has great graphics."
3,Still love M5 but not crazy about their live cd,"Good, not great live album. I still very much love Maroon 5 and normally I love hearing musician's live performances but this album is eh :-/"
4,A Maroon 5 lover's must have.,This was one of my daughter's favorite Christmas gifts. She loved seeing how the band evolved from Kara's Flowers to the hit making sensation they are today. If you are a big fan of the band you will love this DVD. But some of the footage is really old and hard to make out some of the words.
4,Love it!,"Really love this cd/dvd. We use the cd more than we watch the dvd though. I just like Maroon 5 and their other album Songs About Jane, so I enjoyed the live versions of those songs along with a few other ones."
4,Solid Live Material from a Solid Band,"Maroon 5 more than just reproduces many of their studio tracks for a live audience, they throw in new guitar solos and extend others in order to showcase their musical talents and continue the jam; much like John Mayer, but not to the same extent.These type of performers who actually make every night and every show different from the next one are the ones that will prevail and become the ones we look back upon years in the future. The cover of Oasis' ""Hello"" is noteworthy, and Adam's little ""Ain't No Sunshine"" tidbit at the end of ""Secret"" is pretty nice. The new song perfomed live, ""Wasted Years"", sounds like...Is another great Maroon 5 song that sounds like their taking theirselves in a slightly different direction and adds some insight to what their next album will turn out...I am impatient for whenever they get back in the studio!"
2,Fraco,"Infelizmente, apesar de ter gostado da apresentao do Maroon 5 no Rock in Rio de 2011, no gostei deste produto, porque faltaram os grandes, grandes sucessos do show ao vivo do Rock in Rio."
1,Do not buy this CD!!!!! (DVD is great. The CD is a mess.),"The CD installs software on your computer with out your permission. Google ""Sony Root Kit"". Forget about playing this CD thru itunes or transfering music to your ipod. The DVD is great. But don't put the CD into your computer unless you want Sony's Root Kit to open your PC to hackers. Copy protection! Whatever! They want to stick it to you. So stick it to them. Don't buy this CD."
5,Great little pool!,I am very happy with our 12' Intex pool. We have a small yard and this small pool was the biggest we could fit into our little yard. None less it works out great. My kids enjoy swimming in it. It is big enough for me to sit in it and cool down as well as swim around.My husband bought some foam children's pads and placed them under the pool for added protection from rocks and what not. It feels soft underfoot.
1,"Pool might be great, but packaging extremely lousy","I ordered this pool quite some time ago, it still sits in my garage to this day, it came with the box busting and i can't tell what fell out through the gaping hole in the box. The box was very flimsy and the small parts were not individually packed, so they simply fell out during shipping, obviously I did not get everything to set the pool up properly. Great disappointment to the kids.Intex 12-Foot by 30-Inch Family Size Round Metal Frame Pool Set"
3,"Safe, Moderate Stretches","this is a very basic video, composed of two sections:1)An overview of the back, posture and medical issues, along with proper lifting and sitting instructions2)A series of gentle stretches and abdominal excercises primary done on the floor while lying down.I think it would be a good video for an older person or someone new to excercise with very undeveloped abdominal muscles. I suffer from fairly consistent moderate lower back pain, but was not terribly challenged by this workout."
5,The Green Machine,"This book was my favorite for years as a child. I have yet to find a copy, even the copy I read growing up. Every child should read or have it read to them. Good luck finding it!"
5,The Most Fun Possible With Vegetables & a Green Machine.,"I read this book to my kids when they were little, and they thought it was such a gas! The Green Machine is this little car with no visible driver, that tears around a vegetable garden, and all the veggies talk to each other in rhymes about the car. It's silly, it's green, and it was loads of fun. My oldest is off to college this Fall, and he still thinks it was one of the best kids books he remembers reading. We look it out from the local library so many times it got to be pathetic. I would love to have a copy, if anyone ever finds it."
3,The Green Machine,"The book is great for teaching children about rhyming and vegetables but becomes somewhat redundant. The book was published in 1969 so it is somewhat out of date. There are many more recent books that could teach rhyming just as well with more creativity. The illustrations are extremely plain and lack color. Kids in this generation are going to be more interested in the colorful, luminous illustrations. Overall, it is a good idea to give characterization to nonhuman items but I feel that there are more recent books that will capture the children's interest with more colorful illustrations and creativity."
2,"OK, but does not have the version I wanted","KKDL listeners in Los Angeles and Dallas beware. This CD does not have the version of this song played on KDL. One of the mixes comes close but is missing crucial keyboards and drums that are included in the version played on KDL. The versions on this CD sound like project studio demos when compared to the version I was looking for. Oh well, at least it wasn't too much money wasted...-- Disappointed in Dallas"
1,Where's the rest of the season ?,"This release is a gyp ! They did not include all episodes from Season 2. First episodes of Season 3 refer back to the closing episodes of Season 2, and discuss the things that happened there that we never got to see. What happened?"
1,Is that all there is??,"The deleted and unexposed footage are wonderful. Much of the original music has been replaced in the episodes which makes watching them like watching ""Oklahoma"" without Rogers and Hamerstein. I'm very disappointed."
1,Write to Universal - Let them know we won't stand for this!!,"I too am completely disappointed in this new Northern Exposure set from Universal. The price only makes sense if the studio needs to pay licensing fees which they clearly have not done here. Write to them and demand a change: Craig Kornblau/President, Universal Studios Home Video/Universal Studios/100 Universal City Plaza/Universal City, CA 91608. We all deserve better than this. The studio is making serious money off an inferior product."
1,As Brad Bonner himself says...,"...""What a scam""We've been hadChris says, ""It's 'Love is Pain' day on KBHR. Music to soothe the shattered heart. Dedicated to you, Dr. Joel.""AND THEN THEY PLAY THE WRONG MUSIC?Bait and switch - we've been had people. First season they tell us it's pricey because of music licensing fees. We see second season is just as pricey, but guess what...they didn't pay the licensing fees and we get either no music, some original music, or lots of generic music.As Maurice says, ""you gave your word. And I intend to hold you to that word within the bounds of the law. If necessary, without the bounds of the law.""bummed."
1,Caveat Emptor (Buyer Beware)!,"What a great disappointment! The second season has some of the original music removed and replaced with generic music. Longtime NX fans will find this unacceptable. The music is an integral and very important part of the show. Why Universal thought we would accept this is beyond me. The first season DVD has all the original music in it and is a quality buy. The surgical removal of the music in the second season is my only complaint. But I still have to give this one two thumbs down!Jan. 18, 2005 - Be advised that there are some people on this review list that work for Universal/Amazon. Usually you can tell by their lack of music appreciation and their use of all upper-case letters."
2,Shame on Universal,"How could Universal not understand the importance of the original music for each Northern Exposure episode? I got this as a holiday gift and rushed to my DVD to play my all time favorite episode, "" Spring Break"". So sad to hear phony musack replace the perfect opera piece that originally played when Chris is confronted by Ed about the stolen car radios. The music replacement should at least have been revealed with a warning banner on the DVD case. Terrible. Lousy DVD case documentation, outrageous cost for only 7 episodes: this is a bad joke for Northern Exposure fans. DO NOT BUY THIS DVD! Universal deserves nothing for this."
1,Bad/Missing Music - Contact Universal,"Not sure if this has been posted, but for those who are upset about the lack of original music on seasons 2 and 3 (whether you have purchased it or not) you can contact Universal Studios using their form at: http://www.universalstudios.com/homepage/html/contact_us/contact_form.cgi?email_id=11Also, if anyone knows how to set up an internet petition or form email to send them about restoring the music, I would be very interested in this. It breaks my heart that I can't get the REAL show that I enjoyed as a child, and complaints to Universal Studios seems the best option for now. Let them know that you effect their bottom line. :)"
2,Episode 7 missing from this DVD!,"This grossly over-priced DVD set is clearly advertised as and labeled as The COMPLETE Second Season, but is missing Episode 7 (even though the title for it appears in the index). Instead, they substituted a program-length commercial for Battlestar Galactica, masquerading as a special feature.The other reviews here have covered all of the other ways in which this DVD is very poorly done. Universal should be ashamed of themselves, fire the person(s) who managed this DVD project, and either refund the purchase price, or supply replacement discs which actually contain what the label and advertising claim: The *COMPLETE* second season"
2,It's Not Necessarily All About the Licensing...,"I realize that there are licensing concerns with the 2nd season release of ""Northern Exposure."" I'm a rabid fan of this show, and honestly, I'll probably fork out the $60 regardless of how many or few episodes are on it. However, I think it's necessary to point out that licensing music that obscure can't possibly be that expensive. Look at the show ""Felicity,"" for heaven's sake. There's a song in every single scene - and yet $60 buys you about 14 more episodes for your money than ""Northern Exposure."" You know, on second thought, maybe I won't buy this. It's only going to be on two disks. I can just get it through Netflix for a third of the cost."
2,Seriously overpriced,"I love Northern Exposure but this dvd set and the set for season one were overpriced for what you get. Just recently got the first season of MacGyver, 22 episodes for $30.00 and the dvds are not double sided.What is wrong with Universal or whoever it is that is producing the Northern Exposure dvds. I will not buy them at this inflated price and will just enjoy them from the library."
4,northern exposure 2nd season,The package came as advertised and quickly - the seasons are fun to warch with my kids - a good purchase
3,No parka,"My shipment did not include the ""collectible mini zippered nylon 'parka'"" referred to in the Editorial reviews and shown in the product photos. I ordered mine from one of the marketplace sellers who described it as new. I cannot review the discs at this time because I am awaiting the delivery of Season One and want to watch the series in the original order. I assumed that collectors of TV memorabilia would want to know that the ""parkas"" might not be included."
1,Nothern Exposer - The Complete Second Season,"I had intended to buy this set - but upon reading other reviews realized that I should just live with my old VHS copies from the original programs. How very disappointing to think that we could end up buying something that is NOT the original artists view of the show. I agree with the reviewer who said 'shame on you, Universal'"
1,What a let down!!,"I preordered Season 1 but thought I'd wait for Christmas and see if it turned up in my stocking. Just for grins I was checking for any info. on Season 3 when I started seeing the reviews for Season 2. I love this show. The music was as important as the dialog, sometimes more important. I won't be buying Season 2 unless the music issue gets resolved. I don't mind paying for something as long as I get what I pay for. I believe Universal should be taken to task for [...]. I hope Santa doesn't bring Season 2. It would be a waste of a good present."
3,More Universal Greed,"I must echo what others have said here that this is indeed a GREAT program .. my favorite TV series ever .. and I'm certainly glad to have it finally on DVD .. And I too am disgusted at Universal's greed shown by such things as the flimsy two-sided & therefore unlabeled discs, the effort into promotion rather than quality packaging such as there is no listing of individual programs anywhere .. impossible to refer to a case or disc label or anywhere else to find out what's included on each disc. It could have been packed SO MUCH BETTER!! .. without the cutesy & useless little parka thing. For the high price given the limited number of episodes, Universal should have done it right! .. Still I'm happy to have it at all .. once one actually gets to the episodes themselves they are as exquisite as always."
2,Kathy/outraged in Canada,"I have always been a N.E. junkie. I taped the show on VHS right down to the last 110th, even after Rob Morrow left. The tapes were kept in a cool, dark place. I made a grand gesture in buying the whole new DVD set released by Universal, and suddenly realized, when Maggie opened the door to Chris, to give him his voice back, that the sound track was not the original. The original was a an old French version of ""Beyond the Sea"". I was outraged. Music heightens a scene. Can you imagine ""Dances with Wolves"" with inane scoring? I wonder what David Shwartz thinks??? I think a law suit should be instituted against universal. The DVD covers should have clear statements that the music has been altered. The worst part is that I tossed my VHS tapes in the recycle bin."
1,YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING!!!!!!!,"Does anyone have a list of the music that was removed from season two? How many songs are we talking about hear? This is just ridiculous!!!!! No disclaimer on the packaging? Universal should be offering a refund.Hey, I have a good idea why not remove Fleischman from the second season because he didn't get paid enough?"
2,Season One was not very well put together,"I have to agree that the problems with the season one DVD package makes me reluctant to buy the second season. I'm telling my NE friends on forum boards to pass this one by and hold out for a cleaned up package set.My recommendation for season two is for people to see if the same problems (track navigation, episode sequences on disc etc...) have been cleared up. If NOT, I suggest that you pass this DVD set by and just wait until a better DVD set comes along for a different show. For all they could have done with NE, I was let down by the packaging, price, and presentation. Definitely NOT worth owning!"
5,Most of the original music is there,"Just to set the record straight. Yes, there are some original songs missing. If you turn on the closed caption (no, I'm not deaf), the lyrics are there on print but the sound is way different. Also, they did a lousy job choosing the replacement music. The first and last chapters of the season are the worst in this sense. But, most of the original music is still there. This is a great show. Even with the music flaw and the high price, I am very happy with my set. When are the other seasons coming out on DVD? Can't wait!"
1,A big disappointment,"I was one of the few that rabidly defended the exorbitant price of the Season One set on the grounds that Universal did a good job of keeping the original music intact. Not this time. Season Two is not worth the money. I apologize for getting anyone's hopes up that the Northern Exposure DVD series would be something to treasure. It's not, and Universal should be doing all it can to make amends. Personally, I won't be fooled again."
2,They botched such a wonderful show,"Both Season 1 & 2 are seriously flawed in this release. The original shows always opened with a short ""teaser"" scene, followed by the theme song seqeuence. Then after a commercial break, the main episode would begin, with some credits overlayed during the opening scenes. With this set, they have changed the sequence. Now the theme song opens every episode, followed by the teaser. This means they had to move the overlayed credits to the teaser. Even worse, they changed the typography! Instead of the Northern Exposure font, they changed it some generic block font. This totally upsets the continuity and visual flavor of the show. Add to this the missing/changed music in Season 2, and this set gets a big thumbs down from me."
1,DO NOT BUY NORTHERN EXPOSRE ON DVD,"I am completely surprised at how crappy Universal Studios did in making the second season. A lot of the original songs are edited out, the disks aren't even marked with the episodes. I thought after them screwing up on the first season they would atleast try on the second season, but I was wrong. If you love Northern Exposure like I do then you will be very unhappy with the second season. It is a waste of money & Universal Studios should be ashamed of themselves for cheating us loyal Northern Exposure fans. I will not buy anymore seasons until Universal Studios fixes the problems."
2,Just lacking,First review written but here goes. I WAS TICKED!!! Currently in Iraq and DVD's are our lives here since there is nothing else to do. I remembered how I enjoyed the show and noticed that they always had reruns on TV. Well it's because they only have 8 shows the first season. That's 2 shows per side of 2 disks. It's like your constantly turning over disks and looking for something else. I thought I missed something on the menu and there were more shows. But alas I was jipped. I do enjoy that they put the reviews on the items here so you can get an honest idea of what your getting. This movie is overpriced as is and not worth the buy. I liked the shows but the price and the way you buy are sold the shows on the disks is a rip. HOpe it helps.
2,pathetic,"I hate to captialize on what has already been said but, please, 7 episodes? Again? And full price. I find it egregious that Universal did not combine Seasons 1 and 2 into one parka wrapped DVD. It is flagrant corporate greed. Big business sticking it to the common person. And then to skimp on quality by double sided DVDs--and pathetic documentation.While I am an avid NE fanatic--and have them all on video tape from A&E; reruns--I will wait to purchase the DVDs from the ""USED"" bins at my local music/video store. And while I am certainly not condoning theft--it is no wonder that people are copying and sharing audio/video files via the internet and shareware copy programs. while I know it is against the law and therefore wrong--how different is it really from what the companies like Universal are doing to us? In a moral universe of objective law, both such activity would be prohibited. Becasue both are about stealing. And I KNOW Chris Stevens would agree!"
3,Who messed with the music,Why did someone think they had to screw with the music ? This was one of the major great parts of the series and is very notably missing in your copy. I think there should be a refund offered to those of us who have purchased this DVD.D L Cooper
2,Subtitles,All popular TV series box sets come with Subtitle options. Lack of subtitles/special features also makes you ask what makes this DVD different than a VHS? Just the price tag!No discussion for the quality of the show but it would really deserve a more professional DVD production -especially for that price-.
4,Come On Universal..,"I agree with everyone about the stupid parka. Hopefully this will go away with Season 3. I wish Universal would take some tips from the Seinfeld release on delivering quality at a reasonable price. We all love the great music from NE, but how much is season 3 going to cost ? This is a wonderful show..please Universal...show it the respect it warrants.."
2,Defective DVD,"I totally agree not having the original music takes away from the feel of the show, our DVD's will only play the first episode on each side and then will NOT go to the 2nd, so this was poorly made. Hoping amazon will back up what they sell."
5,If You Are A True Fan...Quit Complaining!!!!!,"Finally, what all REAL northern exposure fans are getting and thought they never would....the DVD's. I don't care about the whole ""parka thing"", we know where the money is going. It's going to ensure that you get the same music in the shows as it aired. Come on people, licensing fees. The music goes with the shows and would never be the same without it. How about the episode with Jesse the Bear, when Holling buries him on the mountain side with the beautiful music of Enya. I don't want that replaced with any generic soundtrack. So do yourself a favor and buy these DVD's and be happy about it. If your not a fan, you should be. Northern is a true original, a classic."
3,7 episodes=bull****,"Eight episodes for the first season because it debuted in the summer, ok thats understandable. But seven episodes for the second season! What a load of garbage. The second season of a TV series would not only have seven episodes. Whats the deal universal? Where are the rest of the episodes? If the first season is only gonna have 8 and the second only 7 then put both seasons together!! Even 15 episodes isn't a full season since a full one has 22 but at least you don't feel completley ripped off. Here is a perfect example of corporate greed."
4,Northern Exposure Collection,"THE DVD COLLECTION I HAVE OR TRYING TO HAVE IS GREAT BUT WHEN I PAID FOR THE SECOND SEASON FROM AMAZON.COM THEY SENT IT WITH OUT THE YELLOW COVER ON IT SO NOW MY COLLECTION IS NOT LOOKING GOOD , I THINK IF THEY SHOW IT WITH THE YELLOW ZIPER COVER YOU SHOULD GET THAT COVER AND NOT JUST THE PLAIN DVD JACKET. I VERY UNHAPPY ABOUT THIS."
2,bummed out by the packaging,"This is a review of the actual DVD I purchased - not the show itself, because last time I checked Amazon had nothing to do with that...Anyway, the selling picture CLEARLY shows the puffy little ""jacket"" that the DVD comes in but when it arrived it was not in a jacket - just the DVD in its' cardboard case."
1,Voting With Your Dollars,"Clearly I'm a NE fan or I would not be in this space. I, and many others, were so smitten by it that we dutifully recorded every episode. After purchasing and viewing the first season set, I must concur in every way with Amanda Johnson's comments. The price is nothing short of ludicrous for what one receives. You will be lucky if the two discs play correctly. No, it cannot be ascribed to my equipment - I have some very high quality players. Even the good Amazon discount cannot make such extreme profiteering palatable. If you pay these kinds of prices, you are encouraging the Universal executives who think of you as cannon fodder for their salaries. Wait until the price comes down."
4,Benefit of the doubt,I'm going to give them the benefit of my doubt and assume that the extra costs incurred by licensing the music are being spread across all five seasons to keep the price below 50 bucks for each of them.
3,Lacking in Style,I must agree with Amanda that the first season was confusing in that the DVD's are NOT labeled to know which episodes are where and very poorly done. I also am a HUGE fan of Northern Exposure and spent many hours taping off the TV and editing and retaping for quality and don't see how they will get all 110 episodes to the public based on the OUTRAGEOUS price of these first few episodes. There's still so much to see and at this rate the cost is astronomical! Let's get professional and realistic here! The only reason I bought the first season is because I am a fan but I WON'T pay the outrageous prices! Still love the show and will always be a fan.
1,Write Universal now!,"If you're interested in telling Universal how you feel about their mishandling of the music in the second season of Northern Exposure, you can contact them via email. [...]Music was an integral part of the effect of this show, and omission of even what some may consider simply ""background music"" has an impact on the mood of specific scenes. Those who charge that viewers are being too sensitive about this issue are missing the point: Northern Exposure's success lies in its sensitivity to nuance and detail. Hard to believe the producers of the original show didn't put up a fuss about this. Looks like it's up to the fans."
3,Martin steals the show...,"I saw this book in the grocery store and bought it for one reason: I'll read anything that takes place in Pern. McCaffrey's work was disappointing, though. A nice enough little character sketch and some gratuitous ""familiar name"" dropping, but predictable and short. Goodkind's work was interesting but far too fantastical for my taste, with a too-happy ending. George R.R. Martin, however, gives a great story with ""The Hedge Knight."" Nicely developed plot, well-delivered. My first exposure to Martin's work, but enough to convince me to buy ""A Game of Thrones."" Lots of confusing names and a somewhat unrealistic ending, but a great read nonetheless. Set in a pseudo-England, with characters you love or hate but always care about. Very little ""fantasy,"" plenty of human drama. Bravo to Martin for putting some effort into his work. The price of the book was worth it just for this story."
3,"Some good, some not","All told, an enjoyable read. Terry Goodkind's story lacked his usual depth of character, but that can be expected in a piece roughly one-sixth the length of a typical Goodkind book. Still, a very good story about one of fantasy's most lovable characters. George R.R. Martin hits a grand slam in his story of the Hedge Knight. Great characters, wonderful storyline, lots of action. That story alone has convinced me to read the rest of his work. However, Runner of Pern was an enormous disappoint to me. If you're looking for a Harlequin Romance type of poor-girl-gets-miffed-at-rich-boy-before-falling-for-him schtick, this one is for you. Otherwise, skip it and read more work by Goodkind and Martin."
1,Why was it made?,"This book, not deserving the name of Terry Goodkind in it is a poor copy of Legends 1. with way less storys they are all quite boring ones. Legends 1 has 11 interesting stories that I actually enjoyed. I would not recomend this book to people though I would recamend Legends 1"
3,Great Read!,"This was a pretty good book. I have the complete version of it though. I liked most of the stories but I think the author's should of written more about, well, their main characters. Most of the stories had nothing to do with the book except that it's in that particular world. I don't know, I don't find that too interesting. It's kind of pointless really. Anyways, I enjoyed the stories anyways because the authors are great writers."
4,"Great come back album, and good song","Or could it of been in the course of a couple of albums, and those being yeild,binuarl and the yet to come ""riot act"". Altogh this will be a fairly short review and only basing it on two songs and one of which I have not heard(down), I thought I just might give my thoughts. Upon listening to this song the first few times it really grows on you, of course if I may be mistaken this might be a live version(what I have been hearding on the radio), and has nice smooth vocals and high rythmic guitars. Of course I myself have not bought the single, I want to do the wise thing and wait till november 12th on the date of it's realese to buy it and hear the whole album. But do what you may, but the single or the album your choice and enjoy."
5,Pearl Jam does it again,"The new single from Riot Act proves once again that Pearl Jam is here to stay. The most creative band in rock today, releases two great songs with I am Mine, and Down. I am Mine is destined to be a hit, and showcases the talents of all the band members. It's a mid tempo song, and as usual is a creative step forward for the band. Down is an upbeat, almost Tom Petty sounding song that can only be found here on this single. I highly reccomend this single to Pearl Jam fans past, present, and future. If you were not a fan of the last couple albums, these songs are probably more to your taste. Very mainstream, but also creative. Riot Act is gonna ROCK!"
2,Anyone of Us,"I would like to point out that Gareth Gates DID NOT WIN POP IDOL in the UK. WILL YOUNG did by 500,000 votes"
3,jemma loves garethgats,i love gareth gates because he is soo good lokin and sexy he he i also think that will is quite good to the cd s grate i love his songs.
5,A Very Serious Basie Fan Reports,"This CD lives up to the very high standard established by Count Basie himself. Grover Mitchell and other veterans of the orchestra get it right in all the ways that the Basie Band is known for. Play it back-to-back with any other Basie issue and it delivers. You will notice some differences, especially at piano. That, of course, can't be helped. The Basie sound pulses through just the same and it's a slice of immortality to hear it continue into the 21st Century."
5,Great introduction to rhythmic training,"I use this book in piano studies to introduce rhythmic training. I have the student keep a pulse with the left hand on alternating roots and 5ths while the right hand articulates the written rhythm on a single note, scale, or arpeggio. The roles can then be reversed. The level of the book is just right for begining students."
2,"Good introduction, but lack in details.","I think this tape shows some good introductory methods, but it lacks in details in dealing with problematic behaviors. The sample dogs they used on the tape seem all being already trained, so everything looks very easy. This tape looks more like a commercial for the training company instead of a teaching tape."
4,20Q Review,"This product is veryy similar to 20 questions produced by Sharper Image. This one is much more entertaining for a small group of people. The Sharper Image model is a small hand held device. The display is pretty clear. It has same sarcasim as the hand held, which is quite funny. The only downside I saw to this product is its response time to come up with the next question. This item is fun and great conversation piece. A great modification would be to add a audio version to also ask the question."
4,"Great stuff, but you can get this and more","Jim & Jesse probably produced the best harmony sounds in Bluegrass, and they were in their prime on these recordings. If you can find it, spend an extra ...$ and get Jim & Jesse 1952-1955 on Bear Family. It has all these cuts plus four more, and the usual extensive Bear Family booklet - 14 pages of information, photos and the complete Capitol discography.You can't go wrong with any J&J; CD as far as I'm concerned.This CD gets 4 stars only because they could have easily included the other 4 cuts."
3,Better suited for older children.,"I was looking for a book explaining Tourettes to a 6 yr old and , although this book is well written, it is better souited for older children."
4,Not Bad!,"The Evolution MIDI keyboard does all that is advertised. Connecting to my computer (iMac G5) was a breeze and it has no problem working in my studio with my software (Logic Pro) . I would give it the 5th star, but I haven't finished a project with it yet.Thanks for a great product!"
5,Most Excellent,"I give this five stars for being a decent entry level controller keyboard at only $163.99 (the Amazon price on 9/24/09). And with free shipping it was delivered in one week. It's got a kewl blue blacklt display and the keyboard keys, knobs, and sliders all have a decent feel. It comes with an install CD, but Windows XP recognized it automatically and I was able to start playing immediately. Unfortunately it looks like the price has gone way up, which would reduce my rating to only 3 stars (at $259 it's still Ok, but not an exceptional value)."
4,Get in the car,"The songs of the universal pilgrim, wandering through time and space in a late model Chevy. Perfect for long trips with your lover, especialy if your ""talking to the hand"". ""Damn it Jack"" eludes to the mythical chain smoking, whiskey drenched days of yore, when men only cried on thier way home from church. These songs creep out of America's lost era of billowing smokestacks and confesions on bar room floors. People searching for folk noir need look no further. I don't know who the emporer of ice cream is but I certainly want to stay on his good side. New music for a gone world."
2,Grizzly G4030 go for a bigger saw,"I have to say I was impressed with the quick ship. I have had several bandsaws over the years and I was impressed with how well made this saw is and the weight of it. I was VERY DISSAPOINTED USING IT THOUGH. The 85 inch blades are an odd size that can only be bought here. I have yet to make a single cut without stripping all the teeth off the blade. ( yes I have read the book on tips to prevent this from happening, but it still does it). I cannot cut any big pieces of steel without the reset button tripping on the motor. As of this time the saw sets in a corner with junk piled around it because I am out of blades. it has made 5 cuts. Buy the bigger saw. I wish I had."
2,"Great Color, lousy shipping","The colors are great. Unfortunately, I was not able to use my mower once it arrived 4 weeks after ordering it. When my mower shipped it was missing half the parts, probably due to the fact that it was shipped it in an improvised box, on which the tape failed. The packer did have a sense of humor though. They wrote on the top of the box, ""rattle OK."" That was probably because they ran out of packing materials. I think you are supposed to use more than one of those little air pillows to pack the item. Well that little rattle was the cutting unit falling apart as it bounced along in transit. Anyways, when it finally arrived, the missing instructions wouldn't have done me any good anyways because one section of the handle was missing along with the screws to put the handle sections together. Also, I doubt the instructions would have told me how to reafix the wheel which had fallen off."
1,just doesn't cut grass,"This looks like a great idea, but it just doesn't cut my grass. If I get a running start, it might cut a few blades before it chokes. Now I understand why Europeans don't have lawns - they can't figure out how to make a machine that will mow grass. Sorry, but scissors would be faster."
5,Brill vs. Scotts,"I've owned a Scotts push reel mower for 2 years now and have seen the potential problems with push mowers. The difficulty with the Scotts is that it doesn't cut all of the grass consistantly and you end up going back over the same areas again. I've even tried the sharpening kit and various positioning the blade against the back edge and haven't seemed to get it exactly right. I have even picked up a yard sale push reel mower that is really old and rusty and it worked better but was heavy.I saw the Brill Lexus 38 go on sale at Amazon for $149 and just had to try it. It cuts like no other. All of the grass gets cut and it is so light. Don't worry about the lack of 4 1/2"" of cutting width because it is more than made up in the precision of the cut it makes."
3,Brill reel mower,"A good product, a bit expensive but received a discount at time of purchase. Mower works well, but sometimes the wheels will slide instead of turning which make the reel fail to turn leaving some grass uncut. This is probably due to the light weight of the unit. Cutting more frequently usually avoids this problem. Since I have a small yard, it is not a problem to mow around an extra time. I wish the maximum cut height was a bit higher, but it works well as is, as long as I don't miss more than a week without mowing."
5,Absolutely the best,"I've owned this mower for about 6 months and I absolutely love it! I've always used a pushmower and this is the easiest, most user friendly mower I've ever had. Assembly was easy & quick. I bought the grass catcher to go with it and I'm really happy with the whole package. This is a high quality, well built product."
4,Good for what it's good for . . .,"The Luxus 38 is light, and it's easy to set the grass height. All of the features are just as wonderful as the company claims. However, I was ridiculously ambitious in trying to be ""green"" with this mower and a .2 acre lawn (which doesn't seem that big until you try to cut the grass with a reel mower). If the grass gets just a little too high, the mower won't cut it well. If the grass is wet, or there's a slope on which the wheels can slide, the wheels won't turn. So, for a small, flat lawn, or for touch-ups, it's excellent. Otherwise, reconsider."
5,Excellent Choice,I was a little apprehensive about purchasing this considering the cost vs. other reel mowers but I must concur with the positive reviews that helped persuade me to make the purchase: this was an excellent choice considering the size of our lawn and the ease of use just as described. It is light weight and a joy to use! Being environmentally friendly is an added bonus and I like the fact that we can mow anytime w/o disturbing the neighborhood.
5,Delightful,"This book is whitty, delightful, and just plain fun. :)It is a great summer book that is hard to put down. It can be easily read in one sitting. Not an intellectual book but certainly a good chic-lit."
2,"Too Much Guidance Counselling, Too Little Austen","As a fan of Persuasion, I was excited to read a modern retelling, but this isn't it. The rekindling of Anne's lost love is practically a side story, while we get description after description of the predicaments of the heroine's high school senior charges and their silly ,status-obsessed parents. One mom is described as always on her way to buy her son tube socks -- what? The novel has its moments, but I wanted more Anne and Ben. Cohen's earlier effort, Jane Austen in Boca, is lots more fun."
2,"Not the best, but alright to pass the time","This book was actually a little boring. There was virtually no character development, and very little interaction between the main character and the long-lost boyfriend. It's mostly just an endless series of case studies of spoiled high-school students trying to get into college, occasionally a bit about the main character that seemed almost forced, and then at the end they just happen to end up together. There wasn't enough information given about the characters to really make me care one way or the other. Overall it was an easy way to pass some time, but only if you have already read every word of the airplane vomit bag."
4,enjoyable Read,"I loved the part with the counselors and the seniors applying for college. It was so true. The ""Persuasion"" story line is handled well. It is one of the best adaptations out there for a Jane Austen book."
2,Not great...but kept me entertained when my flight was delayed.,"I have to say that while it was mildly entertaining when all that was available to do was watch CNN, the book was written pretty bad. The whole thing was about random high school students and their college applications. I kept wondering when the story was actually going to start, and then I realized I was only 20 pages from the end. I think the whole thing with Ben should have been a little more hashed out. It was too tidy of an ending for the circumstances. I had to give it at least 2 stars though because it did hold my attention during a 2 hour flight delay. I probably won't read anything by Ms. Cohen again."
2,Just not that good.,"I really wanted to like this book. When it comes down to it, the book is mostly about the main character's (Anne) life as a guidance counselor. Most of the book is descriptions of the students and their parents as they apply to colleges. In between this there is little about the life of Anne outside of the school and very little to recommend the book as a good romance.As a fairly faithful reinvention of the novel Persuasion it may rank high, but as a stand alone novel, it's just not that good."
2,Meh.,"It was okay.Fairly predictable - and, since it's been a long time since I read 'Persuasion,' I can't even chalk it up to already knowing the plot in advance. But after the third or fourth time a chapter ended with Anne pining wistfully away for her lost love (Seriously! It's been thirteen years!) I just really stopped caring.It seems like 'foibles of the rich and famous' books are a dime a dozen these days. I blame Desperate Housewives."
1,Works fine when it works,"Ok receiver, for the money. Sounds fine and plays all my CDs without any problem. However after a year all the buttons except the eject and the on/off button fail to work. Apparently its a common problem. Other than that its a decent stereo for the money."
1,Didn't work for me,"I've owned this unit for about three years, using it lightly (I don't drive much, and usually listen to the radio). When it worked it sounded decent. After a year or so, it sometimes had problems: wouldn't read any CD (purchased, or burned), and the volume knob wouldn't work and it would go to zero volume. These occurred randomly several times. The CD would work again in a few minutes to a few days. Pulling off the detachable face and putting it back sometimes got it working again (or was it coincidence?) The CDs I played have always been clean and in good condition. The volume knob alsways worked correctly after a few seconds. During the past few weeks the CD player has not worked at all. I gave up and got rid of the Aiwa. I did meet someone who has the same unit and they said theirs has worked perfectly, and he uses it often."
1,Avoid it like a bad dream!,"Like reviewer SRFireside ""ZOOM!"" I wanted an MP3 player with a front panel Aux input. The aux input works, but this thing CAN NOT READ BASIC MP3 TRACKS. Let me be very clear - it does not read 'em It just loads the CD and silently plays track #1 indefinitely. A CD player that can not cope with MP3 is pretty much useless today, but one that claims to do then does not is intolerable. It is going back on Monday with a nasty note to the seller for false advertising.In the plus side, it does read basic ""red book"" Audio CDs but also newer style with alpha text data (the display is block style rather then scrolling longer title data). I have not bothered to test a mixed media CD. The AM sensitively seems better than most. The install is simple and straight forward. I am ticked that I had to install it to determine its shortcomings."
4,Wood set,"They are cheap but functional. For what I paid, i can't expect to get anymore than what i got ."
2,Not up to par,"I bought this set based on a few good reviews, with high hopes. However, the set I received was dry and splintery and difficult to clean. I wound up returning this set. Do yourself a favor and buy the ""burnished"" bamboo tools."
2,I can't believe...,"that the closing song that played during the credits ""Itsy Bitsy Spider"" by Joey Deluxe is not on this CD."
2,What a rip-off,"This sounds very much like a knock-off from Jerry Goldsmith's 'Small Soldiers' - same kind of music and same kind of usage of it. Don't buy this cd, get 'Small Soldiers' instead"
5,Good hard rock tunes,"I saw Brother Cane open for Aerosmith at MSG when they were touring on the strength of their hit single ""Got No Shame."" If you're familiar with the music around the time that these guys were at their peak, you're going to find several familiar tunes here. Their style is in the vein of Black Crowes/Rolling Stones. If you are only a casual fan, this is a great set that will not disappoint."
4,this is a fun way to learn about animals,My son still plays with this at 15 months. He enjoys how it lights up and the animal sounds. This is a great toy.
3,"Nice for the Price, But...","This TV has great sound and picture quality. I love how lightweight it is, and it's perfect for a tight space. The base allows you to adjust the vertical and horizontal angle, so you can angle the TV up & down depending on where you've got it in the room. My biggest complaint is the noisy power supply unit. It makes a consistent high-pitched ring tone when the TV is off. Sharp says this is common with all electronics, but I've never heard it this loud on any of my other equipment. Because the TV is in the bedroom, the ringing keeps me up at night. We've even had it replaced with no improvement, so now I have to unplug the TV every night. If you have sensitive ears, this TV may not be good for your bedroom. I've got a Sony 42"" flatscreen downstairs that doesn't make this annoying noise at all."
5,Why Hasn't Anyone Reviewed This CD Yet?,"This CD came out like 6 years ago, and is one of the truely great trance albums out there. Why then 6 years later do I stumble upon Agnelli & Nelson's Hudson St. with no comments? Anyway, this CD rocks, the first 2 tracks are a little really slow, and had me worried this one was gonna be another snoozer like Chicane's. Track 3 ""Let Love Come"", a vocal trancer, thankfully wakes things up a little, 4 slows down a little more still pretty mellow, 6 - 10 will have you bangin' off the walls though. This CD is filled with anthems, an absolute must own."
4,Powerful characterizations,"A very strong book bringing us on a fast tour of modern life, 365 views draws us into the lives of many different characters, yet manages to strongly characterize each person. Each character develops and suprises. The story is intriguing, and the style also interesting. Reminiscent of Haruki Murakami."
1,dissapointing,I have read and enjoyed many of L.E. Modesitt Jr's books. I got bogged down and didn't even finish this one.
2,Disappointing,"I should have looked at the 1985 copyright date. I have enjoyed many of Modesitt's books and was looking for another to enjoy, but didn't feel this story stood up to the later works. It is well written [as always]- there are places where the plot seems to fall apart."
1,Won't buy at this price.,"Congratulations Macmillan! Yet another eBook that you've priced higher than the physical edition! I really don't understand the reasoning behind this policy, but the bottom line is that this is one potential customer you've lost with it.I guess I'll keep an eye out for a used paperback. I'd rather have an eBook edition... I've bought nearly 200 eBooks in the 18 months since I bought my Kindle, but I just won't buy one that's overpriced like this. There's plenty of other stuff out there to read at prices that make sense.Sorry, L.E. Modesitt, that you're getting the short end of the stick here. I've enjoyed your books in the past and look forward to the day that this pricing is corrected in some way."
2,Not Typical Modesitt,"I've been trying to read all of L. E. Modesitt's novels and this is by far my least favorite. The story is disjointed and feels that much is missing. The would be God main character is hard to connect with and though his motives are sometimes explained, they're still hard to comprehend.Not a book I would recommend, but if you are a completionist like me you will still read it."
4,Hammer of darkness,"This story is very new to me as a long time fan this is one of his earlier works but many elements are the same as his other series. I was confused about the ""gods"" involved with the story, as well as many other factors, that seemed interesting but then just dropped. If your reading this be aware that the story is told almost like journal entries, it skips around quite often."
2,good,It was what I expected. Came on time and in the condition descried. I needed this for school . The book is more of a commercial for his classes.
2,Nicely presented but not all correct!,"The more I got into the book, the less it reminded me of the prickly critters I have grown to love. Much of his information is incorrect (the usage of cedar shavings, the 'nausea' sections, etc) and the rest seems to be based off of his observation of African Pygmies in the WILD. Appearantly our domesticated pets behave a little differently. An alright book in general, but you need to discern the good from the bad and that may not be too obvious for the new hedgehog afficionado."
5,Wonderful Book,"I have used this book so many times, I am surprised it hasn't fallen apart! It is the best cookbook I ever used!"
3,Affiliation to DBZ,Does this CD have any affiliation to Dragon Ball Z (DBZ) the Japanese anime? I'm alittle skeptical because there is no picture of any DBZ character on it anywhere. Because American OST for DBZ is usually done by Bruce Faulconer.
3,Its ok,I got this to clean rims on a car that sheds brake dust like crazy.It seems to work somewhat taking about 60% of grime off rims but rims still need to be wiped after done rinsing.
2,Ok at best,"This prodcuts is no different than the at least 10 different wheel cleaning products that I have tried and have not found one of them that actually ""cleans"" wheels. They do remove some of the grime and brake dust, but they alwasy leave the wheel looking less than clean. I always end up breaking out the chenille wash sponge and rim brush to get the built up gunk off of the wheel. Ovreall I think these wheel products in general are just a waste of money, but I keep trying them in the hope that somebody will eventually create one that works, because I do hate scrubbing rims."
2,Not so good...,I love meguiar's products but this wheel cleaner was a waste of money. It really did not clean the wheels as suggested. Don't waste your money!
1,Terrible Cleaner!,I purchased the Meguiar's All Wheel Cleaner today and the stuff did not work very good at all! I sprayed the cleaner on a water soaked wheel and waited 15 seconds for the cleaner to work as directed on the bottle and barely any of the brake dust came off. I do not recommend this product and am really surprise Meguiars would sell such a terrible product! Do not wasted your money people!
1,Horrible!,"Although worked fine on my rims, it stained my brake calipers and brake disc behind it. There is no way to spray it on without getting it on the brake parts. It caused it to turn white in some areas where it was sprayed. Given in many cars the brake calipers are exposed, it can make it look very ugly. Ruined my brand new car!"
1,Horrid,"I have not read anyones reviews, but I can tell you I bought a dozen of these, what a waste I ised them on aluminum, plastic and chrome rims, and the brake dust does not disolve, loosen etc...water and scrubbing works better. Find another product."
5,It works,"I just now used this product on a set of rims that had not been seriously cleaned in YEARS and that I had given up as a lost cause. But, as with many things, following the directions really worked. Wet the wheels, apply the product, let sit for 15 seconds, agitate with a (soft) brush, rinse (and repeat). Do one wheel at a time. In about fifteen minutes I ended up with a set of rims that, if they don't look new (they're eight years old), they do look good. As soon as I finish this review I'll be ordering several bottles."
2,Does not clean as well as other brands,"I used Meguiar's All Wheel Cleaner as directed, and the cleaning power is mild to weak. I use it to cover the entire surface and deep down in the crevices for the lug nuts.Meguiar's wheel cleaner removes 50% on the surface and less than 30% inside the crevices for the lug nuts. Spraying the wheels a second time with Meguiar's All Wheel Cleaner has no effect. I had to clean by soap and hand brush.The product that I used before isMothers 05924 Foaming Wheel & Tire Cleaner - 24 oz, and I will be returning to it. Mother's cleaning power is much higher especially around the crevices for the lug nuts."
5,Works great,"I needed to get some brake dust off and decided to try Meguiar's All Wheel Cleaner. It worked, doing exactly what I needed to be done. And whatever it did not get, I just took a wheel brush and was able to get it all off with minimal effort. Great product."
2,Meguiar's Rim's Cleaner,Received item leaking. Did not like product. Does not work that well. Waste of money! Can clean your own rims with regular car soap and water and comes out the same!
5,This stuff simply works awesomely,"Bought this stuff at one time at Autozone. I was changing the brakes out on my car, when I removed the tires, I would spray some on the wheel I just took off. By the time I was done with replacing the pads, all I had to do was rinse off the cleaner. No scrubbing necessary. This was with brake dust that had been caked on for 2 years. (Before I decided to take care of everyhing on the car myself)Now to be fair, I recently also used it on a more aggressive handling car (i.e. I was able to drive it harder and subsequently brake harder when necessary) and it required me to use a brush to work it in. In addition, this car had not had its wheels cleaned for 6 years prior to me getting a hold of it. With the brush, the wheels looked like new."
1,Try again Meguiars,"This stuff might be good for something but not for wire wheels. Yes, I followed instructions under perfect weather conditions and wheels and tires were barely dirty. For one thing, it took nearly half a bottle to cover 4 wheels and tires,but worse yet it left a filmy residue on both. Especially problematic on wires.Best thing is that I only had to throw away a half bottle."
3,umbrella,"i thought it was going to be wider (the tubes). so that it won't blow in the sand, but that is my fault."
3,Little Tikes Market Umbrella,"I read the reviews, and saw very mixed comments. It is the umbrella that goes to the table I bought for my grandchildren, so I ordered it.I ended up with the same problem that someone else mentioned - it did NOT fit! I tried to file inside the hole of the table by hand, but that didn't do it. I finallyhad to get an electric file to allow the umbrella to fit through the hole. This was ridiculous!! I will be writing to the Little Tikes company as well.......The quality is good, and it works great. But, it should not have to be such a problem to get it to fit! It is the one that goes to the table."
3,WAY overpriced,"I haven't purchased one of these items yet, but you can buy the same item from the Little Tikes website for $19.99 plus $10.95 shipping. Even with the highly overpriced shipping, the total is still WAY less than what Amazon has it for."
4,Umbrella with no shade`,This umbrella looks great with the table but it's a little too small to provide adequate shade for my toddler and her friends. I wish it was bigger.
3,A bit annoying...,"I ordered this umbrella to go with the Little Tikes table that we already owned. It was advertised as being the umbrella that went with the specific table. When we tried to set up the umbrella, it did not fit into the hole on the table. We had to use a saw to cut out the oversprayed plastic on the table and then use a board and hammer to get the stand to fit into the hole. Now we can not get the stand back out, so we have to leave the stand in all the the time and just attach the umbrella when we need it. It was not at all what I had hoped for, but I suppose it still serves its intended purpose."
1,It is useless. Does not fit,"I would like to return this product. The picture clearly told that the umbrella fits in a Little Tykes outdoor table set. But when we received both, it did not fit. Table looks good ( took for ever to install- bad design). But the umbrella is sitting there unused. I'm very dissapointed. So are the kids."
4,Really Good Stuff,"This is more like a 4.5 rating - I generally never give fives.One of those rare albums that combine catchy lyrics and melodies, along with keen insights, meaning and playfulness. And you gotta love Jeremy's passion and desire - biking across Canada playing gigs on the road to get his music out there. An artist who truly deserves to be heard more widely, especially here in the States. Snag this one if you can."
1,Not funny at all,"Basically Mrs. Gruen has written a collection of essays for stay-at-home mothers about the trials and tribulations of being a stay-at-home mom. It shows life in a family where the kids are ill behaved and in charge of the house. The mother in the book (the author herself) seems to hate being at home and being a mom.The essays aren't long. But they just don't flow well. It's as if she's trying too hard to be funny.I can't identify with her.Now I will admit that the last few chapters did start making me smile. I don't know if the author had learned to write by then, I was used to her style, or I realized I was almost done.(previous posted on epinions)"
3,Sammy Sosa High Heat Baseball 2001 Championship edition,"The TV commercial for this game has Sammy Sosa saying ""it's so real."" Well, its not. It is impressive with the detailed features such as stats tracking, minor league management, and career mode. The actual game play and the graphics only pars with games that were released 5 years ago. Every player looks and moves the same. It seemed like they are running on air. There are also some issues with rosters in the game. For example, whatever happened to Benny Abayani of the Mets? Where's Timo Perez in the farm system? Sportsline baseball 95 had real players in the farm system, not this one. If most the attention of non-game play details of this game could be combined with the playibility of Triple Play 2001, then that would be the ultimate baseball game."
3,Not as good as the others,"While I'm also quite a fan of Judy Christenberry's Randalls series, this particular story somehow failed to live up to my expectations. Everybody is just a little too nice, the wounded hero and heroine come round practically without conflict, everything is too smooth and superficial. While it was good to meet old acquaintances, it was not entirely worth the wait, or the money, not even for the pretty picture on the cover. ""Randall Honor"" touched me a lot more. Also, I missed a satisfactory solution or explanation about those mysterious criminals who allegedly burned the house and then got away from prison. Or are there some pages missing in my copy?"
4,A little melodramatic ending...,The game itself was pretty good. Its like Final Fantasy in that you select your commands from a menu and still requires some reflexes because you need to be able to switch between players in order to use them. A drawback to this approach is that if you're a little trigger happy you can pass right over the person you want to do something and then have to go through it all over again. I did enjoy the game but the ending wasn't that good. I didn't even know the game would end there - very frustrating for $30.
4,One of my favorite cds,"This cd brings back all the feelings from being a teen: heartbreak, soft t-shirts, and kool-aid.."
3,Bored,"Personally this CD did nothing for me. Nothing special about the music or the lyrics. It isn't horrible, but I would only use it for background music."
2,Dissapointed in lack of detail regarding borders &amp; figures,"Author does not mention Bokharas, a major design for centuries, (copied by many)except in one small picture. Kurdish tribal rugs are not covered, even though they are becoming increasingly rare. (Try to find one and you'll be steered to a Turkish or Afghan rug!)I expected more detail in the Bidjar design, for example. Most pictures are of older rare rugs--not a great help when looking in todays shops.There is no mention of the Pakistan and Indian rugs of today. He should tell the reader that these are also decent ""oriental"" rugs."
4,Jennifer Hanson,"Only 2 songs on the cd, but both are decent. Beautiful Goodbye is quite good. Easy listening."
2,"Lots of potential, but isn't what I hoped for.","When I saw this book at this price I thought that it would be perfect for what I was looking for as a costumer and medieval recreationist. When I got the book I was very disapointed. It has many pictures, but they are poor quality and most are in black and white. The book isn't even worth half the price just based on the pictures. It has a huge bibliography, and I expected it to have a lot of information, but it just seems to skim over everything. It would be much better if it were bigger to allow room for bigger pictures and details, along with information worthy of the bib."
5,One of the Best,"This is one of the best books on Natural History I have ever read. It is thoughtful and precise, while reading much like a story at times. Reading it reminds me of the true beauty of California"
4,Excellent Resource,"This book was an excellent resource for my research papers, and for my CA history classes. The details are wonderful! This book is a must read if you plan on majoring in History (in the state of CA) or if you are planning on teaching in California."
3,"i would never diss incubus, but why bother with this","ok. so i love just about everything incubus has ever put out including fungus amongus, but why buy this? Crowded Elevator is available elsewhere. I Miss you, while a very beautiful love song, is very similar to the album version, adn i think we've all seen the video to Pardon me on MTV. Save your money, and instead track down Enjoy Incubus or Fungus Amongus or (if you don't have it, S.C.I.E.N.C.E. the best album ever)"
2,For the completist,"There is a lot of overlap between singles (both different and same songs released in different countries) so there can be a lot of duplication.I miss you is the only unique track here (kind of like an early version of monuments and melodies.Regardless not a bad single as there is the album version of pardon me and the great bside crowded elevator, however ultimately fails in value."
2,For the completist,"If buying this version for the acoustic version of drive, this can be found on the 5 track aus drive single for cheaper.There is a lot of overlap between singles (both different and same songs released in different countries) so there can be a lot of duplication.I miss you is the only unique track here (kind of like an early version of monuments and melodies.Regardless not a bad single as there is the album version of pardon me and the great bside crowded elevator, however ultimately fails in value."
5,Incubus,This is once again something amazing from incubus. All of their other cd's blow me away and so does this one...it is a must have for any incubus fan.
5,excellent source of information,The book should be a required reading material in medical schools.The truth on paper.
3,Ummm...Where is the Other Author?,"Is it just me, or was the other author's name deleted from this book? I personally own a copy of this book, given to me by a dear friend whose life was literally saved by Dr. James Schaller and his knowledge of mold toxins. My copy of the book has Dr. Shoemaker listed as an author, but not THE author! It also has Dr. James Schaller, MD listed as the co-author! Can they just take a name. Although narcicistic, the book is actually readable, so it obviously has Dr. Schaller's hand in it...for desperation medicine, this is rare...my friend visited Shoemaker's office, and the copies of this book in the office do NOT have Schaller's name on them. Is that even legal? It's certainly not moral!!"
2,the irony of ironies,"I think it's safe to say that a lot of people that buy mold warriors have mold allergies. i wasn't able to even read the book because amazon's warehouse is so musty that opening the book triggered my allergies. I wondered whether Amazon pesticided its premises as well because the book exuded a chemical smell. I called Amazon and they said they would investigate this for me but as of yet, no word back from them. Buy this book if you don't have any mold issues and you're in perfectly good health!"
1,This Guy Is Spamming My Blog With Crap About His Crappy Book,"The author of this book is so desperate for attention that he has taken to spamming blogs with poorly written pieces of spam. My blog is political (it has nothing to do with mold at all), but this weasel has posted no fewer than six messages under various pen names to urge me and my readers to buy this piece of crap. Even if I had a mold problem, I would sooner drink Windex than buy this piece of junk.Quit spamming people! And quit spamming me in particular, you no-talent hack."
4,cool genre fiction,Day after tomorrow stuff - lots of suspense without alot of gore. Good for adults and young adults. Good price.
2,NOT THE COMPLETE SEASON,DEADLIEST CATCH SEASON 4. ONLY COMES WITH 1 DISC. DOESNT SHOW THE WHOLE SEASON. EXP. WITH PHIL HARRIS GETTING SICK. BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU ORDER
2,Rip Off,"This DVD is misleading. At the time that I ordered it there was no mention of a complete season, I assumed that this is what I was getting. Next year I will wait until the complete season comes out. This is just a gimmic to get more money out of the fans of this great show.Be careful what you order."
1,13,REEFER MADNESS & HOMOPHOBIA ON THE HOOF. I FILED MY COPY IN THE CIRCULAR FILE. DO PEOPLE REALLY THINK LIKE THIS? DID THEY? WOW!
2,Just hope it doesn't break!,"We have a small yard and the 380ASM is awesome except for one major issue. Just short of having it a year, it quit working. I believe that the problem is in the contact switch on the handle which is not user serviceable. Since it is still under warranty, we contacted the manufacturer. We were told to find someone to fix it. That person would contact the manufacturer and let them know which part is broken. The manufacturer will send them the part. We pay to have it fixed, send Brill the bill and they will remburse us. What a mess!!! Now for the good part ... we can't find anyone who will touch it! It's a great lawn mower (while it was working), but the lack of a service infrastructure to support it, makes it something you may want to stay away from."
2,poor battery life,"We bought our Brill mower about two years ago. Our problem is with the battery, which costs $120 to replace. It was supposed to be good for 500 rechargings, but after no more than about 50 rechargings, it no longer holds enough energy to run the mower for more than a minute or two. The place we bought it from has offered no remedy, either a discount on a new one or a way to fix the one we have. So we are using the mower in manual mode, which means that we have paid a lot for just a push mower. Buyers beware!"
3,Fantastic mower untill you need it serviced,"The Brill asm-380 does a fantastic job on my lawn which is about 2600 sf. I have had the mower for 2 seasons now and both my neighbor and I use it to mow twice a week. Me at a height of about 2 inches, his much lower, kind of like a putting green. During this time I have made the required blade adjustments and things were fine. (with extra batteries of course) But now the time has come to get the blades sharpened due to so much use and I can't find anyone willing to do it. I called the US distributor and they told me to take it to a local golf for service. Well I went to at least 5 of them with no luck . So when the time comes for service.....well....good luck"
5,Highlights is the key word,"Despite reading a lot of negative comments, I bought it for my 12 year old daughter as a Christmas gift. Maybe hard to condense all two weeks into two hours of video, so the key word is highlights. I thought the camera work was great and my daughter loved it. I give credit to NBC for featuring sports that Americans did not win. Good exposure to other cultures."
3,Just Okay,"From previous reviews I expected this to be terrible, it wasn't. True is goes along at breakneck speed and very little of the excellent opening and closing ceremonies were shown. However it was thorough with a vast number of events covered. commentry and on screen captioning leave you in no doubt as to who the Olympic Champions are.it is slightly US bias, but nowhere near as bad as the 2008 dvd was.One thing I noticed was a facination with Kate Middleton. She was caught on camera far more times than necessary.Overall a fairly decent effort. I do expect far more from the BBC release though. However this will keep me happy in the meantime."
1,OMG! This Sucks,It's crap. Don't buy this bullcrap! Save your money. CTV's coverage was WAY better than NBC. This just sucks. The coverage that they put in this DVD makes no sense. The commentators are annoying and the camera angles SUCK. It doesn't even include Usain Bolt winning! Can you believe this!
1,The writer should go back to school and learn to write!,This is one of the worst films I have ever seen. My nine year old daughter could have written better than Greg Mellott. I am amazed a studio paid him money for this. To make a long review short. I did not care for it.
1,worst movie ever,"i caught the last 30 minutes of this movie on cinemax last night and had to make sure the world knows to stay away from this movie... the acting and dialogue is the worst i ever seen in any movie, no lie... it was so bad, i couldn't turn the channel so i can sit there and laugh out loud at how horrible it was... i'm glad i'll never have to do that again"
3,"Yes, I have to agree with the other reviewers... a ""so-so"" movie with a really lame and improbable plot","Yeah, I, too, found that this movie was rather disappointing overall... the automobile chase scenes were okay, but that is about all that the movie has going for it... I felt that the characters didn't act in a realistic or logical or rational way, and the ending was pretty unsatisfying, also... the story had so much potential, but it really wound up being kind of a ""lead balloon"", in my opinion."
3,these glasses are pretty good for price i guess,"I bought the goggles for airsofting becausethey had a relatively low profile . I was wrong, these goggles are pretty bubbly, so you might get glasses under them.They are made of super comfy foam, but the nose has a seam that hurts after only a minute of wear. Also, the lenses are held on to your face with the force of the strap, so when their not on you face the glass seperates from the frame.In conclusion, these are not the way to go for airsofting, I would suggest the $15 JT goggles they have on this site., I also suspect that theese goggles will let in dust if your woodworking because the frame and glass are not that securely bound. The main reason for the three is that the nose is way lame, and I'll have to do something about that"
2,Could not get into it,I had a hard time getting into it. In fact I may have made it to the third chapter then skipped around when I finally decided it just was not going to keep me interested. I see others really enjoyed it but for me it just didn't have what the spark necessary to hook me.
1,CHEAPLY MADE,"I bought this to go with my son's gladiator Halloween costume. It is VERY CHEAPLY made. The blade is that shiny, metallic plastic. I'm sure it will break quickly on Halloween night. My son is disappointed to. This is NOT worth $11.99, especially with shipping costs of $4.69! The shipping is almost half the cost of the sword! I do not recommend this sword, especially for children. It is plastic, so it is ""safe,"" but there are better quality toy swords available - and better priced toy swords, too."
2,"Tim Sandlin is a wonderful writer, this is a bad book","I think Tim Sandlin is great. I've read every book he's published. I looked forward to his next book, and I'm still looking forward to his next book despite Honey Dont. At a reading, Mr Sandlin made known that this was the first book that wasn't about himself. So perhaps it's a transitional necessity, an experiment, and good for him. Artists need to stretch. I certainly hope he keeps writing. I hope the Honey Dont becomes a movie and Tim becomes rich off it. The characters are unbelievable yet wacky enough that coupled with the plot (it's really plot driven - ug)that a decent movie could come out of it. Anyhow, my two cents, keep writing and best of luck Tim."
5,Perfect addition for my Sansa e250,"I have had good luck with the SAN-360 FM Transmitter I am using from Maximo, so I decided to purchase the S42 sync and charging cable so I could leave my original cable at my desktop on my home computer and use the S42 when I travel out of town with my laptop. The S42 cable works just like the original that came with the e250 and the only way I can tell them apart is the stamp on the connector. The original says SanDisk and the other says Maximo. If you are looking for an additional or replacement cable, I highly recommend."
5,"A great sequel to the first ""Fletch"".","If you liked Erwin Fletcher, played by Chevy Chase, you will find Fletch Lives a sitch as the journalist and P.I. Fletch finds himself deep into the South where he is able to bring forth many more crazy, cut up disguises. There is a plethora of one-liners and it is sure to please."
4,Mark Phillip Stassen on Fletch Lives,"In my personal opinion Fletch Lives is a work of art.It is a true sequel with brushes of witt,irony and good hearty laughs ! In this day and age it becomes increasingly hard to find a comedy of this stature.Chase is a genious who has perfect timing .Their is also an unforgetable cameo by the late Phil Hartman .Fletch Lives desrves more.Lets hope Fletch 3 carries the legend on more wild adventure into the new Millenium .Mark Phillip Stassen.South Africa"
3,Fletch Lives - Review,"This movie is ok, not as funny as the first one, however I still recommend watching this movie after the first one. Chevy Chase is funny throughout both movies."
5,Death Note (live action),"The movie is awesome. I didn't know that they split the series into two movies though, so I was left at a total cliff-hanger. I guess I just need to go and get the second movie now!"
3,"Cool movie, but not better than the sequal","I geuss you can call this movie a bit of a flop, but it all ties together perfectly in the sequal. Both movies are based on the manga instead of the anime, giving it all a greater seince of closure. Overall good movie, but don't forget to buy the sequal."
4,Pretty entertaining.,I ended up watching this movie several months after I got done viewing all the episodes for the anime series. The first thing I noticed is how the english dub version has the same voice actors of main characters as the english dubbed anime version did... A very nice treat for dub fans! The story is very similar but a little different then the anime. A lot of information was skipped and there are some new outcomes. I don't want to spoil much but fans of the show should certainly see this too. I can't wait for the sequel to come out in America.
5,Where it begins,"My son asked me to sit down with him to watch this and I'm so glad I did . I was hooked on this movie within 15 minutes. Yes the dubbing could have been better but the story line was great , makes you look into yourself and ask the question could I write a name in the book knowing what will happen? I had to see the second and third. Totally leaves you wanting more."
3,"Handsome Young pals, beautiful gals only","Having found a Death Note, student started making justice helped by Azrael, an angel of death or whatsoever, an anime character.Easy watched, this movie and next one, ""The Last Letter"", are on my shelf not to return to them any more because nothing but handsome Japanese youths to watch in."
3,"Interesting Story, not the best acting.","Although my daughter was not imediately impressed when she opened this gift as she appreciates the animation, she was quickly drawn in by the story. The dubbed over japanese was kind of a throw off at first, but once you get into the story line it seems to be less distracting. Not the best acting...very cheesy death scenes...."
5,Revitalizer,"For granite and stone, this product is wonderful. Ecnonomic and easy to use. It's the best I have found. Very good."
2,not happy,This product is not worth the money. Warm soapy water or glass plus does just as good or better of a job.
4,Great for Granite,"I've been using this brand of granite cleaner for about 5 years, and I love it. It cleans my granite counter tops perfectly and does not leave any smears or smudges. I also use it on the porcelain surface of my cooktop. This is the first time I have purchased the citrus scent. While it is pleasant, I prefer the cucmber scent that I had used previously."
5,A great natural stone cleaner and revitalizer,"This concentrated product cleans and shines my dark granite countertops and leaves them streak free. I bought it originally for my slate tile floors which the pro's that restored my tile floors highly recommended. They were dull and drab prior to using it, and I love how it cleans and brightens up the colors like new."
5,Great product!,I put in a new kitchen one year ago. The granite installer gave me a bottle of this and I love it. I keep the large bottle in the basement and refill the initial smaller bottle. It leaves the granite clean and smooth.
5,"Tile and Stone, cleaner + sealer","Spent many weeks gleaning grout on our tiled kitchen, dining room, and foyer. Tried this product to maintain a clean grout. Product performs as advertised. Highly recommended. Now I just spray and mop."
3,OK,"This product felt really harsh on my hair. It isn't possible to use this soap without using a conditioner at the same time. The soap is mild and smells good, but not for hair. I bought two and used only half of one. I just couldn't deal with the dryness it caused."
2,"Works great, once it starts working","*Note that I didn't purchase this bulb here, I bought it in my local hardware store*I just thought I'd mention something for curious shoppers. Recently the bulb in my office lamp went out and I picked up this GE bulb to replace it. The bulb is quite bright and clean, however, it seems to take a really REALLY long time to kick in and turn on. I feel sure the problem is the bulb, not the lamp, since my previous bulb never did this. For some reason, when I come in each morning and turn on my lamp, no light comes on for quite a while, until eventually it randomly suddenly lights up. Most days it takes at least 15 minutes; today it has been 42 minutes so far and it still hasn't come on-- which prompted me to add this review. I don't know if I just got a bad bulb, or if this is normal, but I sure wouldn't want it in my home!"
5,Legendary Feel,"I have been following The Eye since their Tribal Ty days in Boulder, CO. I'm glad to see they haven't let me down. That Tyler guy is so hot and the way he handles the mike gives me goosebumps. The key to listening to The Eye is to close your eyes, let the musik flow through your nostrils, down into your yepsac and let it slowly exit in the outback.Just thinking about it makes me twitch."
1,NOT what the description says it is,"This movie is described as being about hopeful Olympic fencers. When I received this movie, it was described on the cover as an old fictional work about aristocrats in England taking the law into their own hands. I wrote several times to the seller to get clarification and was constantly assured that the movie inside was the one I ordered despite what the cover said. It was not the movie about Olympics bound fencers. Don't waste your money and time with this product if you want a movie about real fencers. This movie is a farce."
3,Reina...Anything For Love,"I anxiously awaited the 2nd Reina single with baited breath knowing that Hex Hector was working his usual magic. I was disappointed. The song in itself is fairly on the average scale. It has a cute melody hook and bubblegum lyrics,and perhaps I'm more used to Hex's dark & brooding reworkings to fully appreciate this song...at the same time I love her first single ""Find Another Woman"" so maybe that isn't it at all. The Welcome mixes are not as good as the Hector ones...giving it more of a top 40 feel. <sigh> For those that missed her first single, the remix is also included in this set so for many of you it would be worth it as a 2for1 deal. Stay tuned for her upcoming singles...""I Miss You"" remixed by Razor & Guido and the remake of Jomanda's ""Got A Love For You"" as Heaven featuring Reina."
2,Domestic screws do not fit BMW,Be aware that the screws do not fit the BMW license plate mount.I was disappointed when removing my old license plate frame and trying to insert the new screw with a new BMW license plate frame that the screw holes did not match. Also the wrench used for installing these screws have a bend that is impossible to use with the tail gate of the care in the way.
5,wow! are these good license plate screws or what?,"Thinking back over maybe dozens of license plates I've had to screw over the years I can honestly say that these screws are the best. And, not having worked in a factory as a low level, untrained machinist for such a long time I had forgotten how much fun an Allen wrench could be."
5,Totally ace!,This product is great for protecting my plate and my Jaguar chrome lisc. plate frames. You have to keep the tool handy in the car though or you are screwed and won't be able to get the plates off if you have any body work done.
2,Poor quality control,Unable to use all of the fasteners because supplied wrench wouldnt fit. Pin hole in wrench machined off center and some of the screws had poor internal hex dimensions (too small). Had to put some off the screws in a vice and hammer wrench into place.I would not buy these again or recommend.
1,"THESE ARE ""STAR"" AND NOT ""HEX"" SHAPED AS SHOWN !!","FALSE ADVERTISING !! PICTURE AND DESCRIPTION CLEARLY SHOWS THESE ARE ""HEX"" AND NOT ""STAR"" SHAPED. RECEIVED THE ""SWITCH & BAIT"" PRODUCT -THE STAR. I NEEDED HEX TO GET MY LICENSE PLATES OFF MY CAR. FALSE ADVERTISING !! Even weeks later, the same hex pix is being displayed, RIGHT NOW !! It's a fine product -BUT NOT WHAT I NEEDED NOR ORDERED."
1,Professional Needed,"I purchased the product to go along with a License Bracket I purchased. The screws were too large for the hole in my car and the plastic locks could not be mounted because there is no way to access the rear of the position the licence was to be mounted. Purchased this product before with an older model car. If purchasing this product make sure it will work on the newer model cars that are out. Good Concept locking screws, but the product was useless on my car model and a waste of my money!"
5,Strokework Flowers Step by Step by Margot Clark,"Definitely a must have reference book for the artist wishing to learn to master multi loaded strokework. The drawings and diagrams are very excellent. The photography is great allowing the reader to view the hand/brush position for every stroke. Margot's written instructions leave nothing to guess. She has taken clean, modern color combinations and given the reader an excellent choice of subject material to practice and learn with. Additional information is giving on beautiful, easily executed faux finishes and trim work. Not only a great learning/reference book, but a good source of inspiration for artists who paint to sell! Learn an easy technique to quickly but elegantly decorated very saleable pieces! A MUST HAVE for beginning artists also!"
5,A candid and telling assessment of the bankruptcy of purveyors of popular culture,"This book overwhelmed me when I first read it over 10 years ago. It was prescient in its hard nosed assessment of where popular television was taking America's viewing population and how its false fairyland, esp. the cult of celebrity, leads to a lack of critical thinking and the inability, indeed, unwillingness to grapple with and parse tough issues. Since then we have seen the depressing growth of ""reality"" TV, info-tainment masquerading as news, dance shows and other drivel that anesthetizes the audience. The authors thoughly explain how and why Ed Murrow was right back in the 1950's with his speech to the National Association of Broadcasters (ably presented in the film ""Good night and good luck"" that television would simply end up as ""lights in a box"" rather than a tool for learning and cultural improvement. A must read for anyone interested in modern popular culture."
3,A compromised biography,"Anne Stevenson never had a free hand. Olywn Hughes controlled this book. As a result, Stevenson did get access to some good material, but she paid a very heavy price."
3,The procession to Ariel,"I enjoyed this book-I wanted some background for when I started to read her journals. I found it was mildly descriptive and the climax was the writing of the Ariel poems. It moved quickly and lacked detail in certain areas. This book did not blame Ted, but I would have enjoyed hearing some of his story. After I finished this, I read some of his poems in Birthday Letters, which I highly reccommend. Since this is the only Plath bio I have read, I don't have the ability to rate this one, but only in my view of what a bio should contain. I look foward to reading the new unabridged journals now that I have a timeline established and details piqued in. After reading this, I realize that SP did exagerate and hurt those around her for the sake of her artistry."
4,a sometimes over-winding but lyrical perspective,"Stevenson seems haunted by Sylvia's voice, because she does not carry the average tone of biographer. This is the first Plath biography I've read, but only because it was the only one that caught my attention immediately. My answer to the less-positive reviews...ALL accounts are biased. It is up to us to collect what we can and make some sense of it."
2,One-sided Depiction of a Controversial Life,"I wish I could give this book two reviews--four stars for the author's perceptive criticism of Plath's poetry, and one star for her depiction of the poet's life. I was stung by her condecending portrayal of Americans in general--one would never guess that the author was an American herself! I was infuriated by the weasel-like way that Ms. Stevenson portrayed Ted Hughes's affair--that he ""made contact"" with the woman who became his mistress, and that Plath's jealousy essentially ""forced"" him to be unfaithful. I had always heard that Ted Hughes's sister had a great deal to do with the final book, and I feel that her spectre shadows almost every word. Never have someone who dislikes you write your biography--particularly if she is hiding behind another person! More fuel for the Plath-Hughes controversy, which will rage on into the next century, even though both protagonists are now dead."
3,Portrayal packs details; lacks empathy,"Why would Stevenson, with her apparent lack of knowledge and compassion regarding mental illness, choose Plath as her subject? Stevenson provides great details of Plath's life and adequate criticism of Plath's work, but loses credibility when she begins to blame Plath for behaviors clearly attributable to Plath's mental illness. Many of these behaviors are certainly offensive (i.e. irrational jealousy and rage). But I find Stevenson's attitude much more offensive, when she chastises Plath for her ""sardonic refusal to accept limitation."" In her final struggle with mental illness, Plath reached out desperately to all who could have helped: family, friends, physician. To compare her to the ""Edge"" heroine who ""has freely chosen the perfection of death"" is irresponsible. No one chooses mental illness, or its often dire consequences."
1,Dimwitted and biased; there are better biographies of Plath,"The best thing that I can say about this biography of Sylvia Plath is that it offers previously unpublished letters and interviews with several of her Cambridge friends. As an American student of Plath and literature, I felt constantly misinformed and oppressed beneath the weight of Stevenson's obviously anti-American bias."
3,Not that great.,Don't be fooled with rated / unrated versions of the game. They are identical except the newer versions were tagged with the new rating system.The game itself becomes kind of tedious and dull if you don't have a walkthrough. Usually you spend your time trying to see weird scenes that you previously missed. The 32x version was much clearer than the original Sega-cd one (otherwise the exact same game).
5,Cult Classic,"Night Trap.The game that caused a whole stir of controversy in the early 90's. And for what? ...nothing at all. By today standards this game would be rated Teen. There are games out there now that would make this look like Mario Bros. Does this game suck? Yes it does. But in a good way. The far fetched story...the terrible acting...the funny dialouge....the cheese factor of this game is over the roof,and thats what makes it so great. It's just so bad that its hillarious. It's also a part of video game history that some people remember....and some that wanna forget."
2,Floss too inflexible,"I got a sample of the Reach Access flosser. So, I tried it because I was looking for an easier way to floss. I have tight contacts between my teeth, so it was hard to get the floss in and out. The piece of floss was also too taunt and inflexible, and I could not floss under the gumline with it. I needed it to ""curve"" it around my tooth more, so I tried to put more force on it to bend the floss into the proper shape, but this caused the floss to break. The handle is nice, and the size is good. My biggest complaint is that it was inflexible and felt like it was cutting my gums instead of being able to floss under them. This product may be good for other people, but I'm going to keep looking."
2,Junk...,"I liked the style of this chair, however the fabric looks and feels cheap. It does not have the appearance of real chenille. The pink was too pale for me. This rocker was comfortable, however mine leaned to one side when rocking and did not swivel smoothly. Upon arrival the skirt was unsewn from the seam in the front of the chair, part of the fabric around the arm was unsewn and there was dirt on the front of the chair. I have found a much better pink chenille rocker at Target.com (pink chenille dream time rocker... check it out first...) I am currently having issues trying to get this one sent back. What a disappointment. :-("
5,"Nice size, nice scent, nice price","I buy a variety of Pre de Provence's soaps through Amazon and am always pleased. While this particular scent/bar is my favorite, I will note that my husband hates having 'leaves' in his soap. I like them - consider them mildly exfoliating, but it might not be everyone's cup of tea."
2,Great soap--a bit messy,"Although this is a great soap, the lavendar buds end up all over the place--a bit messy."
3,"Good intro, but not much detail","This book is a good introduction for people who don't know which kind of dog they want, and would like to peruse a book with pretty pictures.The pictures are excellent. But unfortunately it comes at the expense of the text. Each dog's listing is very brief (a few short paragraphs each) and it leaves you wanting more.Also worthy of note: this book is geared towards a reader in the United Kingdom. Weights and measures are listed in metric units first, with U.S. units (whatever they're called) in parentheses. This also means that when a name for a breed is different between the two countries, the authors go with the European name.So I would say don't buy this book if you're looking for lots of detail on each breed, but DO buy it if you love pretty pictures.(I did not weigh the review about the chocolate in this review.)"
2,Misleading photo,"The photo indicates that the 'shaft' portion (i.e the portion without the threads), is narrower than the threaded portion. This is not true. The screw is just as wide in diameter in the 'unthreaded' section of the screw as it is at the 'threaded' portion. This is not what I needed."
3,Helpful -No,"I would have preferred some pictures, and perhaps a more orderly approach. Be aware, this is rearly just a conversation, not a series of steps. The idea is great, but I suggest some DVDs weould be more useful, although they are very expensive."
2,Aluminum Bottle?,"""Engineered by Carmate, Japan"" but proudly Made in China, the ""can"" is a length of aluminum tube with a [flammable?] plastic cap glued into each end. The ""snuffer hole"" is plastic too. The maker warns users to be SURE the cigarette is completely out before closing the lid or leaving the car. Apparently this ""aluminum ash bottle"" is the functional equivalent of a take-out Dixie Cup. Informed car owners will play it safe, and use a Real Steel soup can instead."
3,"Average ashtray with lid, designed for cup holders","The lid does not seal or fasten. There is still a small gap while the lid is closed, which allows air in and spreads the small powder ash particles all over the car or room. If this ashtray is tipped over for some reason, the lid flies open and the ashes can spill out. Small cup size. Hard plastic DOES NOT melt when putting cigarette out on it. Plastic bottom and snuffer. The only aluminum part is the middle of the body."
1,low quality,"lookes well but have a bad cape, have no rubber soleit is usefull but not hermetic! honda genuine cup size ashtray is much better with the quality and much more usefull,"
4,Useful,I purchased this for someone who has a car without an ashtray. It fits in the cup holder. Put a little sand in the bottom and t's perfect.
5,Car Mate,Works great. Fits in cup-holder. Nice and portable so I can bring into house each day and dump and wash-out so there is very little smoke odor in new car.
2,An adequate but overpriced work glove,"The instructions with the glove say that you should clean them after every use but does not say how.I asked the company and they didn't even know of what material the glove is made. FYI, it seems to be leather, a material that does not take well to being washed.There are much cheaper and equally good or better choices out there. I wouldn't buy it again."
3,pretty useless for a beginner,"While Gabriella's execution of the positions is impressive, the dvd is organized in a way that makes it pretty useless. This dvd is more a reference for how to do the perfect position than it is a routine of any sort. Many of the poses go by way too fast, there's little to no discussion about breath and not even a discussion about warm up or cool down.I'm sure this is a great reference for people wanting to see how a particular pose is done perfectly, but if you're looking for a daily routine, or workout, especially if you're a begining or intermediate student - steer clear!"
2,Not a yoga session- just demos,"I was so disappointed with this video. After hearing great stuff from a fellow yoga student I bought this video hoping for great Yoga sessions. The poses or asanas are demonstrated properly and such, but there are no sequences etc. I guess I've set the bar pretty high because of the video I've been using which has 35 different routines based on experience, time, and special focuses. I'd have to be a very experienced video tech person to record and sequence these demonstration into sequences I find useful. On the other hand if you current do your own routines and are just looking for demonstrations of proper form, etc i suppose this dvd would suit that purpose."
3,a demonstration of yoga iyengar,"If you would like to learn the name of an asana you can use this cd. But as a demonstration of a yoga class, it is poorly made."
2,Hard to follow,"This dvd demonstrates a series of yoga poses, but there is no instruction or program to follow. To use it you would need to select poses, figure out how to do them and then design your own program. It might be just what some people are looking for, but it doesn't work for me."
2,not for yoga beginners,"I've been practising yoga for several years, This dvd is for someone who already masters and understands the yoga postures well."
2,Not for someone wanting a beginner video,This video has no instruction and is definately not for a beginner. I have 1+ years doing Iyengar Yoga and it was still too advanced for me.
4,Good surface read on real bears,"Chadwick presents the ursus horriblius (Grizzly Bear) in the closest account true to its real existance. This is not a book of sensational attacks and mystique, or of tree hugging enviro freaks. It is an easy read of the everyday experience of the bear managers of the Flathead in Montana.The only drawback is Chadwick's over zealous use of personification of bears. The names are used in management only as the equivelent of numbers, but Chadwick takes it rather far in depicting what he calls ""bearalities"".Bottom Line... A must read for anyone interested in the ""real"" real bears.tim"
3,true grizz,"Overall, a good book. Chronicles the day-to-day happenings of a team of biologists that scare/chase bears away from the homes of individuals residing near the Whitefish Mountain Range in Montana. A little bit too much on the politics though!"
4,Polished Entertainment from Barney & Friends,"We got this video probably in 2000. It didn't get much use with my oldest child, as it's pure entertainment and I concentrated more on educational videos for her limited TV/video time. I find I limit TV and videos even more now that I have 2 children (2 and 5), but try to do more of the education myself. This is their current favorite! Interestingly enough, it's Shawn's magic show attempts that capture their imagination the most and they now put on pretend magic shows with their hats, toys and mineral rock collection (""magic minerals"" - don't ask me how they came up with it) every evening with their daddy. My older daughter even wants to put on her own show like the kids in the video. My only question mark with this video is, what happened to ""Min's Flapper Song""? There are references to it in the video, a picture of Min's face in her flapper costume on the back of the video and it's even listed in the songs/acts on the back of the box. Such a mystery!"
1,Fake Crowds,When I First watched this video I was very dissapointed because I thought when Barney and his Friends did the talent show there was a real crowd clapping and cheering for them. But when I first saw this video I found out It was just stupid sound effects. Don't buy this stupid video for your child.
4,Solid Effort!,"I've always liked Grave Digger, they just keep putting out good solid metal. This release is no different from any other Grave Digger effort. It's straight up metal with no extra goodies tossed in the mix to make it sexy or appealing to the masses!Judging by the amount of reviews they get when they release something, they must not be that well known this side of the ocean and that's a sad reality of the music industry in general.Grave Digger gives you meat and potatoes metal, no spoon stuff here, it's fork eating tunes all the way. No fluff, just steak and eggs.The production quality is good as are the tunes. The vocals are a little off the beaten path, but that's what makes it special!If you have not listened to or heard of these guys?, you owe it to yourself to check them out!!"
3,A bit disappointed,"I was disappointed with this one after ""The Last Supper"". ""Liberty or Death"" has no killer hooks and the song styles are generally similar to each other. However, I must complement Chris on his lyrics. The themes he sings about are crucial ones in this turbulent world of ours. An interesting addition to the Gravedigger collection, but not one of their best ones."
2,one good album= greatest hits?,this group had a decent album and a few good songs but a greatest hits album? you used to have made more albums and hits.
5,GAY CHRISTIAN PARENTS???? YOU BET!!,"First, let me say that I consider myself to be conservative in most ways. And a conservative would hold to the ""biased"" notion that two gay men cannot and should not be parents. Mike and Jon Gallucio prove that prejudice wrong! In this powerful book the Gallucios prove that there IS such a thing as ""gay christian"" who can raise a family with upstanding moral values, better than most heterosexual families. Their fight to win permanent custody of their adopted children is told powerfully and convincingly. I shed many tears reading this book and I'm proud for the Gallucios. I applaud their convictions, their courage and their ability to fight for what is right in this world. May God Bless them and their beautiful family! By the way, as of this writing, they are grandparents now....their adopted daughter Rosa recently gave birth to a baby girl! Congratulations!"
5,An against-all-odds type book,"I never thought I would read a book like this, much less interview an author of a book of this nature on my radio show, but I am so very glad I took the time to do so. I've never read anything like it, and when you read it, have a box of tissues handy!Jon and Michael went through pure hell to adopt these two (ultimately 3) special needs kids. Never even having changed a diaper, they take on dispensing medication - and machine type medication at that! Forget the fact that they are a gay married couple - they are men! Two men adopting children! What married woman could get her husband to do the things they single handedly did!This is an amazing story - you must read it. I mean it sincerely, have a box of tissues handy!"
3,"great story, so-so telling of it","This story is amazing and I have the utmost admiration for these parents! Their account is inspiring. How it is conveyed is somewhat flat, more of a recounting of activities -- like a diary. The emotionality could be more compelling if it took on a reportage style and less a recollection of events."
3,"A Touching Story, Not Told So Well","This book was a difficult read at first, the reason being that the writing style of the Messers Gallucio left a bit to be desired in the area of style. Still, the heartfelt urgency of the story of their nurturing a sickly baby into a healthy, rambunctious toddler drew me in and kept me interested. Their story is an inspiration not just for gays and lesbians, but for anyone who wishes to have a family."
1,Darkroom Familia: Connected By Honor,"I own the video. I find it to be wack. It has good quality stereo hi-fi sound but the videos are weak. They can't rhyme. I think this video is wack. The only video I liked was the one with the Coup in it. The coup From the CD ""Steal This Album"""
3,not all that,the book is too biology/chemistry related. I was looking for a more practical hands on approach to exercise. This is great if you are already very knowledgable and perhaps you are in the profession of exercise. For your average person it was way too detailed. A whole chapter was on the Kreb Cycle. Who cares tell me what exercises are most beneficial. He also refutes alot of theories that have been long standing in exercise yet he does'nt provide proof of his way.
5,"Fit or fat, I'm skinny",This is a good book for those who are not looking for miracles. I have been a runner and coach for 35 years. This is good info !
5,One of best guides to fitness,"It is a great book. Although this book is not new, it was published in 1994, it will give you an easy understanding of how energy is found in your body to do your everyday exercise. It is a great choice for those starting out and how to really understand how your body works when it comes to finding fuel to do what you have to do at the gym. Of course, it is recommended to talk to your doctor before you start any exercising. If you want you can try to see if your local library has it and if you like it you can come back here and buy it. Good luck."
4,Easy to adjust irrigation unit,"This is easy to adjust both the left and right stops without removing the unit from the ground. It works well. The only reason for four rather than five stars is that it only comes with one nozzle and the nozzle kit is sold separately. They could include a few nozzles with the unit, although the nozzle kit has several and one kit could serve more than one unit."
5,To me it's definitely five star!,"I was looking for clean movies, so hard to find anymore! I searched through older movies and ran across this one. It was so refreshing to watch this series. The moral aspect of the movie as a whole was better than the downside of the occasional drinking of alcohol by Will and Jeff. Each episode is the same but different. Still looking for Jim Sonnett, but new encounters in very town. Walter Brennen is a legend! This series is definitely one of our favorites!"
5,Great series,It's a great series -- we have loved watching it and feel the quality is well worth the purchase. Thanks
4,WALTER BRENNAN'S ONE MEAN HOMBRE!!!,"How great is it to be able to find all these great old shows at the click of a button? This is one of those shows. 1967 western in color with a great premise. GRODIN, NICHOLSON, HOPPER and many more guest stars and character actors from a great era. I can't give the dvd 5 stars because the audio and video could be better but the show is REALLY good! I am buying the 2009 release of season 2 and if the picture and sound has been improved then I will get the 2009 release of season 1- the show is THAT good!!! Try it, you'll love it. PEACE"
3,The front cover can be misleading.,"I admit, I was enticed by the low price. The front cover reads ""Season One"". So I just assumed this meant the WHOLE season. Nope. Tagged at the end of the Amazon title listing for this item are the words ""Disk One"". You'll have to open the case to realise that disk one contains only NINE episodes,roughly one third of a season. How do I get the other two thirds?I guess buy the more expensive version."
5,"SUPERB, anthemic, trance rollercoaster!!","A complilation of the best of what the Sheffield, UK megaclub had to offer in 1999-2000, Gatecrasher-Wet is a glorious ride. Full of unreal highs and devastating lows, the anthemic melodies contained herein seem to bypass the ear entirely, opting instead to directly infect the portions of your mind that cause perpetual bliss and motion. EVERY track is a possible classic, and many already are. Europe, and the Brits in particular, are perfecting the art of modern dance music, and this double CD is one of the finest examples I've ever heard. If you are looking for rich, melodic electronic/techno/club music, with the power to rule your emotions, then DEFINITELY purchase this masterpiece!!"
5,Candy to the ears!!!,"This has to be the best trance cd compilation I've ever heard. I can't stop playing this set as so many tracks are delicious. The second CD is especially amazing, much better than the first."
4,"Smokin', drivin' trance","Ok, I've been through a lot of progressive trance mixes in the past year (Global Underground, Cream, Hooj Choons, etc.) and I've got to say that this one took me by suprise. No mention of the DJ who mixed it (good move! After all, it's all about the music). Really great tracks, although the mix is fast and feels a tad rushed. All together it's got to be one of the best genre compilations of the year."
2,cheesy and dry,thought this cd was simply lousy considering it was release by one of the best clubs in england. the programming sucked and so did many of the 36 tracks
4,"Wet with sweat, I ain't stopped dancin' yet","This is the type of CD that you will leave in your CD player for days at a time. The tunes are awesome and the mix is brilliant. CD 1 is a little tame in parts, but CD 2 is worth the entire purchase price. Like I said, I'm still dancing!"
4,worked as advertised,"I've had this on my counter top and back splash for over a year now. I have what I think is a relatively porous granite - typhoon bordeaux, and it has not stained. I reapply every six months - my third coating will go this weekend (hopefully). It's protected against a variety of spills including coffee, water, sauce splatters from the oven... I'm most impressed that the coffee didn't stain since some of the spills are there for a while (my pot auto brews in the middle of the night, and I've woken up to a couple of spill overs). Application is easy- pour it on, spread it with with a rag (or not- I didn't bother the second time, I just poured it and wiped close to the edges so it didn't get on the floor), let it sit, then wipe it up."
1,three coats and still NOT waterproof,I have applied 3 coats to the marble floor in my bathroom. I have applied it with a roller making sure the surface was well covered with the product. I let it cure for 72 hours with no foot traffic. Still most of the area is not waterproof.Do not care about the $33 I paid for the product. I do care for the time I spent for the application. The product is a joke. Go for the expensive stuff that comes in a green bottle at the home depot. I used it to seal my other bathroom and 1 coat did the trick.
1,Don't bother,"I lugged this stuff halfway around the world to a house I was building on the Mediterranean and smugly announced to the installer that going forward nothing would penetrate the granite countertops, this product came from America!!! So now I have huge grease stains that will not go away and even water penetrates the granite, although the stain disappears after it dryes in the case of water. To any prospective buyer, ask for a sample. Perhaps it will work for you but despite careful adherene to instructions it was a total waste of money in my case."
1,MotelTest,Dupont Bullet Proof only stops mold for a few months. Our old Acrylic Color Tile sealer lasted more than a year until it was discontinued. Also tried TEC Grout Guard Silicone sealer; only lasted a few month. Still looking for a good sealer that lasts more than a year. Don't recall if Color Tile sealer was water based. Best thing has been adding better ceiling fan ventilation.
2,Not so sure...,"Price was good. Easy to apply. My only concern is that after applying 2 coats as directed and letting dry for 72 hours, standing water still cause the granite to darken. That would indicate to me that the water is penetrating the granite. Once dry, color returns to normal but is this typical? I would think once a sealer is applied, nothing should penetrate the stone. I applied this to the granite counters in my bathrooms. I'm glad I went with quartz counters in the kitchen. That looks as good or better, requires no sealing and is maintenance free.Update 7/25/2010I have staining on the granite where the soft soap dispenser dripped. That tells me this sealer is ineffective. I am downgrading the rating to 2 stars."
5,Great seal but need to use it properly,"I love this product but you have to read the instruction carefully before using it. On my first attempt, I brushed it onto the stone and because it dries up so quickly, it leaves an unsightly haze that makes the stone looking even worse than before. So I repeat the procedure and before it has a chance to dry up, I use a towel to immediately wipe off the extra amount, buffing and rubbing it into the stone. This then works out beautifully leaving a nice layer of protection and shine to the stone. So when used properly, it is a wonderful sealant."
1,Changed Formula= Bad Product,"The old formula Stonetech Bulletproof was an excellent product.The new product (now reformulated by Dupont) i purchased was an entirely different sealer and performed very poorly. I don't know if the reformulation was required by environmetal regulations or something else but the change is for the worse.In addition, i made the mistake of using the old formula and new Bulletproof to seal an area of granite. At the intersection of the two where the products mixed, a cloudy mess formed which almost ruined the stone."
5,"Works well, far better than other sealers","We too had White Kashmir granite countertops installed in our kitchen without realizing just how porous they were. Just putting down a wet glass left black stains for a while although they eventually dried out. I tried a few other sealers without any luck. This sealer seems to have done the trick. Plus, this sealer did not have nearly as unpleasant an odor compared with others. I recommend this and will apply it again in a few months."
4,So far so good,"I used this to seal a marble table top a couple weeks ago so I can't give you a ton of perspective on this product, but so far I like it. I've been very careful so far, but drops of water on the table don't lead to any darkening so I'm hoping it is pretty sealed. It was reasonably easy to apply, though to get a shiny finish back we had to do the last recommended step and polish the surface with a small amount of sealant and a lot of elbow grease. It was fine for a table and it looks great now, but it would be a lot of work to do on a whole floor, at least the way we did it."
3,Great Reviews,This product had a lot of decent reviews. I have about 54 sq. ft. of counter top. This worked well for the most part but there are a few spots it didn't work (mostly around the sink).
1,Does not work for me,"I followed the direction, but it did not work for my countertop. It is like water that stayed on the top of my countertop, and when I wiped it out after a day, everything is removed. Nothing left to protect my countertop. How does it seal anything?"
3,clap clap claparoo,"everything went well with the purchasing, but the clapper isn't the greatest thing ever to hit the world marketplace. but hey we are having a great time with it and i believe everyone should own one."
2,not good with kids,it would be fine for a quiet household but with barking dogs and 2 toddlers it is a major pain in the ARSE!
1,Check wattage of appliance,"Didn't work at all for me because the out-of-the appliance I wanted to use with it had to much wattage (a track light) and clapper only works up to 250 watts. Oh well, maybe I can use for my Christmas tree."
2,not worth the annoyance,"I wouldn't buy this thing again. We have it running a lamp next to the front door. There's no wall switch for that outlet, and the switch on the lamp is a bit cumbersome, so I thought the clapper would be a convenient way to turn on the light when returning home at night. It is, but the unit is way too sensitive. Maybe it's the acoustics of the room (hardwood floors), but just about anything will set it off as another reviewer mentioned. Ours does have the adjustable sensitivity and even with it set fully to ""home"" mode (least sensitive) it gets triggered when not desired. It will eventually get scrapped when we get a different lamp with a more accessible switch, although I'm just about fed up enough to do away with it even before then."
1,Major fire hazard,"After owning it for a few months, the clapper died today. As I clapped I heard characteristic buzzing noise of electronic item being shortcircuited, and to my horror when I looked at the clapper it was flashing bright yellow from the inside, it was actually on fire inside and smoking really bad. I unplugged it immediately. I'm glad I was there because this thing was actually on fire (don't they have a fuse or something to prevent this?), and it could have burned down my house. And for the record, all I used with it was a 100W lamp.It's a fun and convenient little object, but after seeing the fireworks today, I would never ever recommend it to anyone. Moreover, I'd actually recommend you stop using it immediately, unless you think $15 toy is worth risking your whole house, and maybe lives of those who live there. This thing is a disaster waiting to happen. Consider yourself warned."
2,More of a nuisance,"This little device was more of an irritation to me that I finally unplugged the sucker. I pluged a lamp that I have in my bedroom to the clapper and it would turn on and off at the slightest noise! If I dropped the remote on the floor, it would go on/off. If my TV made a loud noise, it would turn on/off. If I was talking on the phone, it would turn on/off. I used to joke that I had a strobe light in my bedroom, but it got too much for me to handle that I had to finally unplug it. It didn't come with a sensitivity switch and was VERY sensitive to sound, so in short, don't buy it unless you plan to live in silence."
1,"Clap On (maybe)... Clap Off (maybe)... Clap On, Clap Off, A Crapshoot","What a disappointment! The device just wasn't predictable. Sometimes it would do as expected, sometimes not. It was just a crapshoot. Finally unplugged it and it's in a drawer somewhere. Yes, I played with the sensitivity with no success. Getting up to turn lights on and off was far less effort and aggravation than trying to convince The Clapper to do its thing. Save your money and look elsewhere."
3,A strange problem ...,"After reading the reviews here I decided to order a Clapper anyway, for a floor lamp with a hard-to-reach switch. Like others, we found that the lamp kept spontaneously turning on and off. So we lowered the sensitivity and the Clapper began working perfectly. For a while. When winter came I bought a small stack of firewood that I placed a few inches in front of the Clapper in our living room. The Clapper seems to be sensitive to having objects placed in front of it -- the firewood created something of an echo effect that the Clapper is very sensitive to, and we can't adjust the sensitivity of the thing to keep it from turning on and off by itself at the very softest noise. So alas, I had to unplug the Clapper. But it had worked perfectly well up until then."
1,The clapper caught fire,"I received this for Christmas and it worked fine for 6 months. Then in June 2009, while watching tv with my two young children, the lamp turned off for no reason. I walked over to the clapper and bent over to look at it, when it started sizzling and crackling and glowed bright red. I think the red glow was because it was on fire on the inside of the unit. I unplugged it as fast as I could but the house smelled of smoke for a long time afterward. I am just glad this didn't happen while I was out of the room. I think my house could have burned down and/or my kids could have been hurt. Why hasn't this product been recalled?"
2,The Clapper,"For starters... it was a gift, but in following up on how they liked ""The Clapper"" - we were told that it ""has a mind of its own"" and many other sounds activate it at whim. Apparently, it was turning lights on and off all evening during a recent dinner party. They seemed to get a kick out of the gift, but it didn't exactly perform as intended for their needs."
2,A bit disappointed...,"In theory, this product is great. I used the clapper to activate some rope lighting in my kitchen, to keep me from plugging/unplugging the lights every time I wanted them on/off. Even on the ""3-claps"" setting, my lighting goes on/off every time I use my microwave or do anything in my kitchen, dining room, or living room. You should see the light show when microwave popcorn :O"
3,"hard to use, but fun","I bought this as a joke for my partner. It's fun to play with, but surprisingly hard to make work. If you don't get the clap sequence timing just right in doesn't work. Fortunately the LEDs help train you. Perhaps it would be easier to use if they hadn't added the second socket requiring three claps. I would have preferred to buy a simpler one.Update: two years and out. It gave up the ghost exactly two years after I bought it."
3,Neat but impractical,"The clapper is a neat device, I bought one so that I could turn off a bedroom light from bed (out of laziness not necessity). The clapper had a hard time isolating my clap pattern in even low to moderate noise levels (like an open window or humidifier running). The unit also gets very confused if you don't follow the order of operations as you connect the appliances it will simply blink an error message and fail to work. Since it failed in the bedroom I have yet to find another application, I plan on giving it away."
2,clapper,Product is fine but I can't use it because somehow it affects my dog. My dog will not staly in the room when it is used.
2,did not work,"l did not like it it would not work!,,, please save your money, you do not buy of oder the clapper!"
3,Heats up quickly,It was overpriced and more bulky than I thought. It heats up from remaining plugged in which seems dangerous to me. We stopped using it shortly after getting it.
1,These are a waste of Money do not buy !,"I have purchased several of these over the years, they last maybe 3 months and then you might as well throw them away, in that 3 months, about once a week you have to reset them or they don't work.these are crap. do not buy them"
2,Hit & Miss,"I bought this so that we could turn a light on in our mud room from the garage or the house side since the light switch wasn't near either door. After trying numerous times to get my claps just right, we returned ""The Clapper"". Perhaps it was due to the accoustics in the room, but I had to try about ten different clap versions before I might actually turn the light on, or off.The Clapper Sound Activated On/Off Switch, 1 Each"
2,Disappointed. :-(,"Blew one of the two fuses in the Clapper on day #2, so only one appliance will work in it now. And, we have hardwood floors, and walking with high heels on the floor turns the light on and off constantly. I find myself having to sneak around my own bedroom. :-( That being said, when I'm trying to clap it off from bed, it often takes me 5 tries to get a loud enough clap to shut it off. Definitely not ideal. Will probably go with a remote light switch next time instead."
2,Clap for what,"Was glad to get it, but it no longer works. Have tried everything but it still does not work. opps"
3,Works well most of the time,"There are two settings: two-clap and three-clap. Two-clap works well most of the time, but is a little too sensitive and sometimes goes on or off when you don't want it to. Three-clap is too hard to time right."
1,Ruined my radio,"I had it plugged into a radio, then it shorted out my radio. The radio was dead and had to be replaced. I had wished it was a good product, but it wasn't. :("
4,Cannot clap quickly twice,"the pause for the clapper in order to make it work was a shock. it goes clap-pause-clap-pause-pause-pause. I never in my life thought that was the sequence for the clapper. Otherwise, it was 100% functional, it was shipped on time/in an orderly manner, and it met or exceeded my expectations. Another shock about this product is that it has TWO outlets, not just one as I had expected before I purchased it. I guess I should have read more reviews before buying it, but this clapper stood out different than expectations while still performing well in every aspect it was intended."
5,DIDN'T WANNA START AT FIRST !,"IT'S QUITE SENSITIVE EVEN MY DOG TURNS THE LIGHT ON WITH THIS CLAPPER , HAVE TO BE CAREFUL NOT TO TURN MY STEREO OFF WHIL LISTENING TO MUSIC ANC CLAPPING AS I HAVE THE LAMP AND STEREO PLUGGED INTO THE SAME UNIT ! UPSET AT FIRST CAUSE IT WOULDNT TURN ON BUT WORKS WELL NOW ! OH AND IT HAS TWAO PLUGS I THINK I MENTIONED THAT , I RECOMMEND YOU GET IT OR A COUPLE OF THEM !"
4,Works Great!,I like the clapper. I've always wanted one; don't know why I've waited so long to get one. The product works great! It was super easy to set up and works just like on the commercial.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS,"It took 3 weeks to arrive, it almost never responds as advertised to the double clap but random noise frequently activates it. It's a great idea that needs A LOT of perfecting. Don't buy it. Trust me. This thing is an overpriced piece of trash."
2,Way too noise sensitive,"Bought to plug in a lamp in the bathroom so my preschool age son could ""clap on"" the light when he needed to go. It's way too noise sensitive and would turn on and off constantly due to any noise. I don't recommend this product, it's pretty useless unless it's in a very quiet place. It does, however, make a great white elephant gift at Christmas!"
2,I gave it away,"We used it for a couple weeks as an easy way to turn on hard to reach plug in lamps & a power strip which is behind a couch, which in theory, sounds like the perfect product for those 2 issues. unfortunately, it is difficult to get the correct cadence down to consistently make the clapper work.Also, when watching movies or games, the louder sound effects, especially gun fire, cause the clapper to turn on & off = very frustrating"
2,"Fun toy, but crap for use","Bought this thing a few days ago, was great at first, but now it is so sensitive that sitting down in my office chair sets it off. unfortunately it also does not have an off button, and I dont feel like rewiring my entire desk. As another incentive to NOT BUY this product, I have read many reviews that say it caught on FIRE! The clapper now seems to me like a dangerous toy out of a comic book from the early eighties. To any impulse buyers (much like myself) think for a few more seconds about how useless this product is."
2,Very difficult to activate,I purchased this for my 82 year old mother. It was very difficult for her to activate the device. So if making a loud clap sound is difficult for you - this is not for you...
2,Hmmmm...,great idea poor implementation or maybe my hands don't make right clapping sound... actually these work better when you cough - i realized that when i had cold and was coughing all night and lights were turning on and off... i also might got defective unit since lights would turn on it's own without any sounds just because...
3,Unit is not as easy to use as it could be...,"Getting the clap right is not as easy as it should be. It is also a little too sensitive, even on the lower sensitivity setting. So I will find the light on."
1,Hazardous,I just tried one of these. As soon as I plugged it in it crackled and started to smoke. I would be afraid to trust one now. It is the first and last time that I will plug one of these in. What if this had happened when I wasn't there?
2,Chaotic Clapper,"This model proved to be erratic, responding to incidental room noises sometimes, but at other times ignoring distinctive claps. It does provide some entertainment value, but can be disruptive at night and at other times simply annoying. The sensitivity control seems operative, but doesn't make the operation any more predictable."
1,If I could give it 0 stars...,"...I would. I had high hopes for this device. It was going to eliminate me from having to reach over my couch, very uncomfortably, in order to turn on my lamp. Instead, I plugged it in, clapped a couple times, and nothing happened.Hmmm...maybe I just have to adjust the sensitivity. I tweaked the sensitivity until my hands were raw and I got no response from the device. I decided to try it on different outlets with different appliances. I still got no response. Maybe it will work in the three clap plug! Nope. I promptly packed it back up and returned it to Amazon.com (at which time they graciously provided a refund).I have to imagine this product has worked for someone. That someone just isn't me. You've been warned."
1,Don't get the clap! The one I purchased was just awful. You had to clap so hard and it did not work consistantly if at all.,The one I purchased was just awful. You had to clap so hard and it did not work consistantly if it worked at all.This was a bad choice for me.
2,Not very functional,"This product works great on TV but in real life if very temperamental. You must have 2 claps in the right direction with the right timing in order for it to work, however, if you slam a door it works perfectly. I seems to work better when you don't want it too. I had to disconnect mine. Not a good product. Try a remote control. Much more efficient."
4,The clapper really does work,"It works so good it works too good. I love this product, however, dont put it in your bedroom if you tend to be a noisy sleeper or loud in the sheets.....LOL! It picks up on sounds easily and quickly and the lights can be going on and off......."
4,clap annoying,this product lived up to what was promised but I should warn future buyers that it is very sensitive; i.e. when I cough or my phone rings my lights often go off. if you are patient it is not much of a nuisance but for the rest of you i suggest getting up and walking to the switch.
1,Clapper doesn't respond to claps,"I received The Clapper for Christmas from my husband. I was so excited - I hate having to get out of bed to turn the lights off at night. Well, he finally unplugged it last night. My claps aren't loud enough and it only works sporadically for him. I realized I had to use a pair of hard-soled shoes to get The Clapper to turn on or off. I can get the sequence down for both sides - that isn't the issue. But I live in an apartment and had to hit the shoes together so loudly that my husband could hear them outside and around the corner - I'm sure my neighbors will be just as glad to get rid of The Clapper as I am. We tried each sensitivity setting. We also tried it in another room, thinking the location might have been an issue - it still didn't work. I was very disappointed."
2,less than stellar,"I purchased this for my dad who is 87. He wanted a ""clapper"" in the bedroom so he didn't have to deal with the lamp switch when getting up at night. Problem is that it doesn't work all the time. I wouldn't advise it for anyone to spend the money on."
4,The Clapper Rocks!,I didn't even know that this item still existed. I purchased this for my wife for Christmas this year and it's so far gotten a lot of use. It's extremely reliable once you understand how hard you have to clap and in which rhythm.
2,More of A Pain than It's Worth,"I boughtThe Clapper Sound Activated On/Off Switch, 1 Eachto go on a light that either has to be plugged in/unplugged or the light has to be loosened/tightened in order to use it. It's a small lamp that sits across the room from where we usually sit (less than 6 feet), so it's very inconvenient to have to get up every time we want to turn the light on or off, but there are no tables or shelves to put it on... The Clapper seemed like the perfect solution.It would turn on/off if our dog barked, but we could clap 4, 5, 6... times and it wouldn't turn on/off. Sometimes it would work the first time, but we almost always clapped twice, just out of habit, so the light would turn on the first time and off the second time. Loud laughs would sometimes trigger it, too.Eventually I returned it as it was just too much of a hassle."
1,Just does not work,This thing will probably work if you are in a perfectly quiet room and are capable of perfect clapping.It takes me on average 5 claps to get it to recognize a clap and then it turns off itself when listening to the radio.Its a great concept but mind numbing that it is simply such a bad product
1,Died after only 2 months,This thing died after only 2 months of use. It still detects the clapping sounds and you can hear the switch click but it will not provide power to the device that's plugged in. The clapper is not cheap and I am very disappointed that it failed so soon. Junk!
1,not worth it,"We had purchased this for our Grandfather who had just come home from the hospital. We thought this would make his life alittle easier. It didn't. You have to clap just right for it to work. Needless to say, we were disappointed and returned it."
2,You have to clap just right...,"This product responds to three claps, and all must be just right in intensity and timing. The idea of the clapper is great but in practice it is fairly difficult and frustrating to use."
4,It's not bad as everyone makes it seem,I just got this and loved it. Noise from my TV didnt set the lights off neither did shouting at my relatives. there needs to be a pause between the sound so it doesnt really get set off unless you time yourself clapping. It's great especially for me because i have a light that you plug in on the other side of my room so it was a pain to turn on the lights at night when there was complete darkness.
3,It was Great -- Until it wasn't!,"I don't typically write reviews but I have some serious concerns about this device.I have had mine for almost two years and it worked reliably albeit with some of automatic on/off issues that other reviewers have mentioned.Yesterday, I had what I thought was a blown bulb upon turning the lamp on. However, after replacing the bulb, I couldn't get the unit to work again. I left it unplugged overnight and tried to get it to work again today in a different outlet. As soon as I plugged it in, the unit began to smoke and emit a very foul odor. I unplugged it immediately and it went straight in the trash!I'm afraid to try my luck with another one. Too bad, because I enjoyed the convenience."
1,Just does NOT work,"The Clapper has been around for over 10 years (15? 20?), but I'd never tried one until I was given one as a present a few days ago. Let me just say this: I'm so glad I didn't waste my precious dough on this piece of junk. It's nothing more than a piece of junk, a whimsical piece of junk, a worthless piece of junk. It's frustration upon frustration to no end. It simply does not work. My palms ache from the clapping and this POS just drives me crazy. I'm throwing it into trash, period. Don't bother. (To be fair, I've heard people having better, less random results when they cough or sneeze or laugh funny, but I tried, none of these worked for me at all.)"
2,Random,"Unfortuntately, this has actuated with a door closing, me putting down a book on a counter, practically me farting. You have to live in a very quiet house for this to work."
4,Great for late night reading,"I'm not old..I'm not feeble..but I love this product! This is definitely not your Grandmother's clapper! I bought three of these because I love to read and hate getting up to turn off the light before falling asleep. I was concerned after reading some reviews that it was too sensitive, but there's a way to adjust that on the unit. I have four dogs who love to bark at something around 3 am every morning and the barking doesn't turn the light on and off. You do have to learn a pattern. With the unit that allows for two or three claps you need to be patient if you use only the two-clap option, as it waits for a possible third clap before turning on or off. It's great when I start to doze off...or wake up early and can just clap the light off or on."
1,simply does not work as it claims,"I bought this product about month ago right before December 2011. Although I read some reviews that said the product did not work. I thought Ishould give a shot any way. There is some thing wrong with the mechaniim and when you want to turn a device on or off, you have toclap 3 times not 2 as it states. the two clap side is totaly disabled and not working right out of the box. I would suggest finding anothercompany with similar device. will not buy another one."
2,Not as advertised,The product does not work as it is shown on TV. There are very specific instructions on how it works and it is not so easy. The item was a gift that is now just gathering dust.
4,Haven't used it yet,I have not used it yet but I hope to use it soon and will expect good results - I have wanted a clapper since the 1990's!
1,It Sucks!!!,"It doesn't specify that on the web page that its for 110 volts and its very sensitive to sounds, you can regulate the sensitive level but it still sucks."
2,Clapper,My son used the Clapper to give a presentation. It worked right up until the time he needed it and it wouldn't come on. It ruined his presentation that he was giving at work. He wanted to be able to clap his hands and have a lamp come on. It was embarrassing for him.
1,Clapper,With all this global warming... Everyone should now be using energy saving light bulbs and as it has been stated it DOES NOT turn off fluorescent lights which are fluorescent so then... get up from out of your chairs or beds and turn the light out normally!! the exercise will do you good.
2,"Claps on, but won't clap off","Overly sensitive, no matter how you set it. Coughs, laughs, doors closing, etc., all trigger The clapper. But then you can't ""clap"" it off. Takes a lot of getting used to."
1,Erratic and Dangerous,"After less than three weeks of use on two 60-watt lamps (The Clapper is supposed to be rated to 400 watts) in which the device only operated after multiple attempts and only if it were in the open (not obstructed even partially by anything) it burned out one of the lamps and shorted out internally with great arcing, popping and acrid smoke. Had I not been there to remove the power immediately I am sure a house fire would have been the result.I would advise everyone against purchasing this device even as a gag gift. Someone might actually use it."
4,It works; It's not perfect,"I use my clapper to control a floor lamp with a compact fluorescent bulb. Contrary to what some other people have reported:1) It does work with fluorescent bulbs. At least with my bulbs.2) It doesn't turn on/off often or unpredictably.It does have a few drawbacks. First, sometimes I don't successfully clap it on or off on the first try. Trying again usually works. Also, some sharp repetitive noises set it off. When I had a cold, my coughing would turn the lights off, which was funny and only occasionally inconvenient.If you are close to the clapper case, you can actually tap lightly on the case instead of clapping. In my room, this works very well for me.So, it's useful. It has limitations. If are good at reading directions & you don't cough too much, this may be a good gadget for you."
2,Review of Clapper,"I loved the clapper, however, it only lasted about 2 hours. We followed the instructions, plugged it in. We clapped 2 different times to make sure it worked. I unplugged it until my grandchildren arrived, plugged it in and it blew up. I am not happy about this at all. Now I am stuck with a $25.00 piece of plastic that is no good to me."
1,Rip off.,Only worked for 3 days.Maybe im being harsh on them but i spect a product much more than that even if they offer to change it. For me its like buying a brand new car and after 3 days of usage it wont start.
2,clapper,"product has already quit working which is a problem because i'm handicapped and need this product in order to turn on the lights in my living room. A previous clapper I had lasted about 3 years, this one barely lasted a month."
1,"Sorry, But It Only Lasted A Month","It worked well for a month. Now it's broken, past the return cutoff for Amazon, and the INSURED return will cost half as much as the purchase. Worth it? NAH."
1,Throw the Clapper into the Crapper,"I recently ordered the Clapper. It worked for all of five weeks. Now it doesn't respond to any noises, especially clapping or the many expletives shouted its way. I now have no use for the product. Maybe an expensive, ugly looking, and worthless paper weight? Nah, I think 'The Clapper into the Crapper' is the poem for the day!"
5,"The ""Clapper""",Works great and Amazon was the only place I could find it. I wish I hadn't wasted time running around to every store in town trying to locate it. One click and it was here in two days.
2,Blinking !!,"It Claps on and off OK, but when it's off, the light blinks periodically. So, its a waste for me."
3,clap clapper,"I actually bought this for my Mom and then she and my brother changed their minds. So I have it now. It works quite well, we plugged our Christmas tree lights into it. Only thing it turns lights off sometimes when we didn't even clap. some other noise in the house triggered it. I don't trust it not to turn lights back on in the middle of the nite, so been unplugging it."
3,the clapper sound activated switch,"The basic clapper, seems to be a bit finicky to work with. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't."
3,Not long term,"I received the clapper as a gift a year ago. At first I was extremely satisfied with its performance. Soon, however, the device began to become less sensitive and I had to clap so hard it hurt my hands. I discovered that pounding on a table in the same pattern activates the clapper, but even then I had to hit the table directly over the clapper very hard. This was all totally bearable until one day I began to smell burning rubber and discovered it was coming from the clapper! I had had two devices plugged into it as it is made for but I guess it overpowered the clapper because after the burning rubber smell it stopped working all together. The clapper is a fun and convenient device, but it won't last you long."
4,"I like its functionality, but it only lasts about six months","I like its functionality as I have a hard time with mobility issues and I can turn the lights on from anywhere in the room, but it seems like this device only works for about six months and then you have to buy another one. And when it burns out, you generally have to replace the light bulb in the lamp as well."
1,Doesnt work in the U.K.,"American power amp, and socket, doesn`t work in the UK. Tried everywhere to buy one and didnt think when I found it Amazon U.S.A.."
5,These Things Are Cool!,"Well, I remember when the clapper first came out, must be in the 70's or 80's. I always thought of them as a gimmick and never owned one. Well, this year, my teenage kids started asking for them. After thinking about it, I figured any product that's been around 30-40 years must be worth trying.Since we had no luck locating them at our local home improvement or drug stores ('cause they were sold out!), I ordered them from Amazon. They were waiting for us when we returned from our holiday travels.This may have been my teenagers favorite gift this year. They work great and are fun!"
1,Clapper review,You have to bang on the wall 3 times before a delayed response happens. We have not found anyother combination that works
3,Hard to get the sensitivity just right.,"When I got these I had some fun with it at first, but over time my lights would turn off randomly or the TV would set it off. Also sometimes they would turn on seemingly randomly. I fixed this by switching it to three claps instead of two and now they work just about perfectly. Maybe once every two weeks now I will be watching a movie and three noises will set it off but its pretty rare. It is very nice though to be able to turn my lights on or off while lying in bed so I'd say worth it."
5,I'm impressed,I don't have perfect teeth. I've got pockets around the back molars but I just couldn't maneuver the floss into thse areas effectively. I tried the plastic wedges and they help the outside pockets not the inside ones but I was still just barely breaking even with six month check-ups.I have switched to the Reach flosser with snap-on heads and this thing is really great. I can easily reach all the pockets even behind the back molars. My most recent dentist visit was the first positive experience I have had at the dentist in some time. I'm never going to have perfect teeth but perhaps now I can expect to keep the ones I have for a very long time.
2,work OK but made to soon fail!,"Could the manufacturer make these flossers so they would last far longer? Of course they could. Why won't they? It's called profit. I use them for now, but when they are gone, I'm going back to purchasing regular floss at the 99 cent store. It's a far better deal economically. It's the small things in life that raid our bank accounts, until they add up over time to huge expenditures. They are convenient, but at 14 cents each, I can do without them. So can you! They only last about three days, using them one time a day. I can watch them fail and wonder what I'm doing buying them. And since they aren't available in bulk on line, I suspect the maker is behind that."
2,The hippo needs some real friends.,"This book gets two stars for being well-written, having cute pictures, and being fun to read. However, I am concerned about the content. If you want to bring up your children to resist peer pressure, then this might not be a good choice.I'm sure the author didn't intend anything bad, but when the hippo finally goes along with the crowd to have some fun, some alarms go off in my head.Clearly the hippo's struggle was with shyness, and the other animals certainly weren't doing anything ""bad,"" but when my daughter encounters situations where others are having fun but she's struggling with her moral compass, I want her to have the strength to leave that situation and find some different friends who have their heads on straight.When my daughter's a little older I'll ask her to help me write an alternate ending for this book, in which the hippo will find some real friends who respect his values and like him because of who he is, not because of what he does."
2,"Loved Moo Baa La La La, but not the Hippopotamus!","Cute illustrations cannot hide an unfortunate message of exclusivity. Children should be taught to treat others with kindness instead of ignoring a new friend.While the other animals are not to blame for the hippo's shyness, it is certainly within their power to ask her to join in. Sadly, more than three-quarters of the book (and five opportunities to be friendly) pass by before they do so. Even then, the armadillo is left behind. Instead of ending the book on a positive note, the author apparently planned for a sequel.Even the book's dedication smacks of cliquism. I have no idea who Ash, Kyle, and Paisley are (children? pets?), but to explicitly exclude one is to start the book on the wrong note."
1,Negative messaging,"I first read this when a friend bought a set of Sandra Boynton books for her soon. She and I were both horrified by the ending.There were far more positive ways that Ms. Boynton could have ended this story - the hippo could have returned and invited the armadillo along; the book could have ended with the hippo being invited along; all of the animals could have come back for the armadillo.To me, the message of this book is that someone is always left out and implies that it is OK to leave out someone who is different.It's a shame, because the other books in the collection are wonderful. My children will never read this book."
1,BIZARELY WRONG MESSAGE,How this story was seriously considered for a children's book is beyond me. It is carelessly and needlessly cruel to its characters.
5,So much fun...,We had checked this book out at our local library and liked it so much we just had to purchase it. Great price.
5,Hippos!,"The poor hippo is feeling left out. Everyone else is doing things but not her. (But not the hippopotamus.) She just watches until ""The animal pack comes scurrying back, saying, `Hey! Come join the lot of us!'"" Then- ""'But YES the hippopotamus' But not the armadillo."" The pictures are wonderful, as they always are in Sandra Boynton's book. They are cute, bright, bold, and colorful. The words rhyme effortlessly, and flow wonderfully as well. Besides this, a hippo is the main character, so the book must be good! ;) I must say that my favorite picture is the first one, the one of `a hog and a frog do a dance in the bog.' even if it doesn't have a hippo in it.Loggie-log-log-log"
4,love this book,I love this book. The story is cute and repetitive; perfect for early learners. The pictures are vivid and it is a good sturdy board book.
5,So cute,"I love the Sandra Boynton books, the rhymes are fun, and the pictures are cute. My nearly 1 year old daughter loves books and will grab various books of her shelf for me to read to her. This is one of the books I don't mind reading again and again (and again). The message isn't great if you don't follow up on it- the poor hippo is excluded for the majority of the book by the other animals and it ends with the hippo being invited to join while a poor little armadillo is left out. My daughter is too young to get any sort of message out of a book at this point, but it seems like a really good way to address being left out and how that makes someone feel with a young child. I would recommend to other parents of young children."
5,Great Boynton book!,"I love Sandra Boynton's books - or at least almost all of them. Some are absolute classics, like ""Pajama Time"", and a small few miss the mark, ""Snuggle Puppy"". But this is one of my favorites; very sweet and funny, and my kids laugh along with the book. I highly recommend."
5,Makes My Baby Smile Every Time,"We own a few Sandra Boynton books, and this one is, by far, both my baby's and my favorite. My daughter is four months old, and her face lights up when I read ""But Not the Hippotamus"" to her. I think she enjoys it because of a combination of the pleasing rhythm and the repetition since I read or recite it to her multiple times every day. I've read this book so many times, I now have it memorized but still find it thoroughly amusing. The characters are participating in such delightful activities, and the illustrations are perfect. I plan to buy this book as a gift every time friends or family members have a new baby."
4,But not the two year old...,My two year old shut the book as I was reading and refused to listen. I found this shocking because Boynton's books are usually a hit with my twins. He did bring it to his sister a day or two later and listened 1/2 through...so maybe the two year old...
2,Ehhh.....,I have all the books from Volume I and II and this has to be my least favorite. My baby is too young to understand but I don't like this book. It makes me sad everytime I read it. Poor hippopotamus and then poor armadillo!! The rhymes are good but I don't like the plot.
5,bought for the local library,I bought 2 books and donated to the local library for the early childhood section. I was proud of this book. Thanks
5,But Not the Hippopotamus,A wonderful book to teach babies about reading--charming illustrations. Parents and grandparents will love sharing this with the little children in their lives.
5,But not the hippotamus,"Boynton is the best; her offbeat rhymes, charming illustrations, and positive story lines create books for children that can be enjoyed over and over by both parent and child."
5,"Fun, along with encouragement","In the spirit of Boynton books, this one lives up to her very good works. We enjoy them just for the fun of reading them... any lesson or encouragement that comes out of them is a plus."
5,LOVE IT!!!,"This is one of our favorites by Sandra Boynton. My daughter is into Hippos (not sure where the interest came from), so I bought this one for her. She loves it. Very cute and fun!"
2,Not a good message,"While S. Boynton's other books are well written, I really don't like the message of excluding others in this one. It seems that the hippo is shy and no of the other animals ask her to play until late in the book and then it ends with the exclusion of another animal..the armidillo. My son likes the pictures so I have re-framed the book to include a ""because she is shy"" in a reasonably positive voice and in our house the armidillo gets to play as well (it is ""and the armidillo"" on the last page.)I give this book 2 stars because of the illustrations and pleasant rhyming scheme."
4,Another Winner,"Yet another winner by Sandra Boynton. The kids love it. They are quick reads, but easy for little ones to learn."
4,Great book but . . .,"I LOVE Sandra Boynton's books, but this one made me feel just a little bit strange. Perhaps it's because I was usually left out of things, events. But my 2 year old enjoys the rhymes and pictures, so for him it's just fine. It's not his most favorite book, but he enjoys it just the same."
2,size of book,The story is fine but I htought it would be a full size book and it was a small book. I thought it was a little expensive for that.
3,"Cute, but not my favorite of Boynton's books","Maybe this book will grow on me over time as I read it to my son, but so many of the Boynton books have a joyful tone to them. This one didn't seem as catchy or fun as some of her other ones. My son is 21 months old, so he is mostly entertained my my reading to him and looking at the pictures anyway. But this one doesn't catch his interest as much as ""The Belly Button Book"" and many of the others that are just plain fun to read."
5,"Fun and rhythmic, a great way to get your children reading","This book is bright, simple and has a great rhythm. It is about a hippopotomus who is left out of all her friends activities and, of course, how she eventually joins them. It's easy to get your children to begin reciting in reply to each statement 'but not the hippopomus!'. I found my, then 2 1/2 year old 'reading' this book (from memory) to her little sister after only a few weeks. Excepting the fact that many of the terms used for the animals are hardly recognisable outside the US, it is a great little book. A word of warning though.... it's not a good bedtime book unless you plan to read it 30 times before their heads hit the pillow."
5,very helpful,"This book has been my guide for 40 years, helping me cope with a chronic bad back. I bought this copy to share with a friend. It is the best help I know."
1,"oh my back, its worse than ever","after reading this book, the condition of my back has deteriorated to the point that i can no longer stand, sit, nor lay without a stabbing pain traversing the entire length of my contorted spine. the book, though highly technical, gives no practical solutions for the man or wo-man with back pain. mr root, thank you... for nothing"
5,"A Billly Graham Music Homecoming, Vol. 1",I loved it. Loved the music - Loved the Gaithers. If you like good Christian music - you will like this.
5,This was a cute video,"I used to be extremely fond of this video as a youngster. My favorite part is when they have Baby Bop hiding inside one of the gift-wrapped boxes in the background and eventually we see her come out. Some questions I have are, 1)what do presents have to do with anything that the backdrop is full of gift-wrapped presents? and 2)was this Baby Bop's first appearance ever? I have now handed the video down to my little cousin who has enjoyed it."
4,A GREAT TIME FOR ALL~!!,"Even though I have not watched a regular episode in YEARS, may I say the purple guy puts on quite a show here~! I guess I am hooked now, since our babysitter's 5 year old brought the tape over for she and my sister to watch. One night, i guess she accidently left it here and I watch it every chance I get! I hope she lets us keep it! Oh...and the Backyard Gang....theyr'e cool....but if you ask me, a few of them are a LITTLE hyper~! I think the more mature ones are just a lot calmer~! But all in all, this movie is GREAT~!! Now, for some flaws... besides the hyperness, Barney and yes, some of the Backyard Gang, are trying a litle TOO hard to get the young tots and adults in the audience to play along. Which suprises me, especially reguarding the little kids! But again, in general, GREAT MOVIE~!! ****~!"
1,The Worst Barney Video Ever!,"This video is extremely horrible! No one in our family liked it at the ages of 1, 2, 3, & 4. We really thought that his voice needed some adjustments and his costume was terribly homely. Why we purchased this video, don't ask me! If you like Barney concerts, I reccomend Barney Live In New York City, Barney's Musical Castle, and Barney's Colorful World because this one is awful!"
4,Very enjoyable,"Great sound, great picture, excellent performance. Jagger is in fine form, and his vocals are very good.Sometimes a singer will sound less than enthusiastic when doing a song for the 1000th time, but that is never the case here (well, almost never).This two-hour concert recording includes Keith Richards doing a wonderful ""I Wanna Hold You"" (a non-album track) in a surprisingly strong voice, and a fine set list with ""Satisfaction"" as an energetic opener, as well as several well-executed classics.The band is excellent; Richards' guitar work is tight, and bass guitarist Darryl Jones and the other backing musicians help drummer Charlie Watts keep things in place.A very enjoyable performance. 4 1/2 stars."
3,Great Concert....Average DVD,"The Stones put on a great show and it's captured beautifully on video but this DVD is lacking in a few things that would have really made it special. First of all, why no DTS sound? If you're not sure what this can add to a concert video, watch the DTS version of The Eagles ""When Hell Freezes Over"" and compare it with this or another non-DTS DVD (provided your player supports DTS).The other minor complaint is there are no bonus features (ie. interviews, backstage scenes, music videos, etc) that would have added greatly to the live performance. It's as though the makers of this DVD did not realize the potential of the format they were using. A few little additions would have made this one of the all-time greats. I'd still recommend this DVD to any Stones fan because it's wonderful to see Mick, Keith and the boys in this format and the concert itself is a fantastic performance. I just hope the next time they release a DVD, it has more bells and whistles."
4,"Stones Are Still Great, But Not Excited Enough As Past","When listening to their past live CDs and LPs, it makes me so satisfied with Ronnie's guitar playing which was heavier and stronger, particular in songs of HONKY TONK WOMAN, JUMPING JACK FLASH, BROWN SUGAR. Something to do with their ages and mental hearts ?? This DVD's recording is not good enough as compared with John Fogerty, Fleetwood Mac which I think as Warner's best, hope to improve that! Afterall, it's still good to buy and keep it if you are Stones' fan."
4,good show in dvd the rolling stone,a good show although I had liked a better work as soon as the edition of images but clear in some topics and it would also lack to incorporate some menu of options as for the sound in the rest I insist a very good show of the rollin
3,ok but not the best,this dvd is stones but not up to their best. any stones are great so since this is fairly inexpensive i might recommend it
5,Simply the Best,"This is the best concert I have ever seen, oh and it was from my couch. This was awesome!"
3,Stones in St. Louis,"One of the greatest performances of the Bridges to Babylon Tour. The whole band sounded great, and were full of energy. Great performances of Sympathy, Like a Rolling Stone, and the rest of the Hot Rocks section. My only complaint is that the editors didn't include some songs (3) that aired on the Pay Per View Concert, including a great version of Corina, Corina, with blues great Taj Mahal. Oh well, you can't always get what you want!"
4,Yet to build but ...,"we love these kits! K'Nex Education does a great job with these. Not to mention, they work well into the other K'Nex pieces."
2,Pyle of Junk,"Although the microphone unit itself feels heavy and well-built, the wireless portion is junk. The base of the mic will accept either the included XLR cable or a wireless 'stub.' There is a small base unit with an extending antenna (about 12"" long) which connects to your audio equipment. You'll need to buy an extra 1/8"" to 1/8"" mono cable to connect to a PC sound card.The wireless reception is abysmal. If you move around while singing into the mic, it keeps dropping signal and emitting a loud static 'snow.' Even standing nearby (10 feet) and carefully orienting the microphone with the base antenna, the signal inexplicably fades in and out.At least the unit was very inexpensive...not worth my time to issue a return. The mic may work fine with the XLR cable, but I didn't test it that way (that's why 2 stars instead of only 1)."
2,Good mic.. Bad wireless!,"This microphone is a good,crisp and clear mic. Only when it's wired via XLR cable. Warning...the wireless reciever is not good at all and didnt even work at all! Way to much feedback/distortion but it did start picking up a radio station. Failed ! Not a wireless mic."
1,"At $20, You're Basically Buying a Lottery Ticket","It just happened to be a losing one, for me.I've never heard such muddy audio in my life. I've only tested the wireless functionality, as I don't need another wired mic. I would not recommend this, to anyone, ever.It's possible that some of these units don't make you sound like you're speaking through three feet of wet burlap, but it's not worth the gamble. Avoid."
1,COULD BE BETTER,"I USED THIS MICROPHONE WHILE DJING AT WEDDINGS. THE MICROPHONE IS BUILT VERY WELL IN TERMS OF DURABILITY, BUT THE WIRELESS PORTION IS BAD. LARGE AMOUNTS OF STATIC IF MIC IS HELD UPSIDE DOWN OR SIDEWAYS. ALSO STATIC WHEN THE MICROPHONE IS OFF AND THE RECEIVER IS STILL ON. THE MIC CAN ONLY BE TAKEN ABOUT 3 FEET FROM THE RECEVER. IF IT IS TAKEN ANY FURTHER THEN YOU WILL RECEIVE STATIC. THE MIC AND THE RECEIVER BOTH RUN OFF AA BATTERIES, SO CARRY SPARES. MY ADVICE IS SAVE YOUR TIME AND MONEY AND TRY ANOTHER."
3,so-so mic,not the best mic system but not the worst. this cost half as much as others so that was why it was appealing to me.it was out of the box and set up to use rather quickly though.there is a some buzz feedback at times and the range isn't huge. but it does work for short range/indoor situations and can put out a clear nice sound.
5,really good product,"Don't know why some of the review were bad, but i'm so pleased with my purchase. so far i have nothing but good things to say about it...it works and sounds great...just perfect for what we use it for!"
2,Disappointing musically,"Her voice is, of course, beautiful. The arrangements, however, were blah, bland, and boring. It felt to me like she was just putting in her time, without actually putting any emotion or style into it. I had thought that it was a given for an Anne Murray CD to be good. I was wrong. I wouldn't have bought them if I had heard them first. Very disappointing."
4,One of my favorite Christmas CDs!,"The CD is absolutely beautiful. Just one minor problem, in shipping the case itself was crushed. I would definitely recommend this album to everyone!"
4,Genuine HP inks at prices even HP cannot meet,"I have a rather expensive HP Photosmart printer that requires eight different ink cartridges. The benefit of this product is that I can order individual cartridges when a particular color runs low, rather than a multi-color cartridge that must be replaced when just one of three colors runs out. This review covers all colors of HP 38 cartridges that I have purchased through Amazon.com.Since I paid a small fortune for this photo printer, I refuse to use after-market inks. I only use HP Vivera inks. Eight ink cartridges can be pretty pricey. However, Amazon.com offers these genuine HP inks at prices lower than I can find anywhere else.As genuine HP inks, the color and printing quality is superb and consistent. Amazon.com helps keep the price within reason which allows me to enjoy the photo printer.Thank you."
2,Over Priced & Better References,"This book is quite overpriced relative to similar books. Better titles are available from Dover (Universal Millwork Catalog), Lee Valley (Home Interiors of the 1920s), Linden Publishing (Modern Practical Joinery), Fredionia (Modern Carpentry) that cover the information and provide more information at about 1/3 to 1/4 the price for each book. It looks like that many examples are out of these books commonly available. Furthermore, this book has relatively few examples for each catagory. Before you spend the money on this book, check it out from your library or have them get it through interlibrary loan along with the other books mentioned."
3,"Good book, but overpriced","This is a wonderful book detailing how millwork evolved from the 1870s until about 1940. It provides a good overview, and is more of a history without getting really in depth. It could just as easily have been titled ""An History of Millwork from 1870 to 1940"". There are some molding cross sections and quite a few pages out of catalogs of the time. However there could be many more. On the other hand there are many reprinted catalogs available. If I were doing period work, I would consult this book but definitely have old catalogs on hand to have a large selection of details to pick from. Both the architect and the carpenter can find some use in this book."
2,A Little Disappointing,"Like several other reviewers, I found the book to be overpriced. The book provided neither extensive and in depth narrative history NOR extensive patterns. ...and I don't believe there was one color photograph to be found. Don't buy it until you've had it in your hands."
2,Historic Millwork,"I was expecting to see many more architectural drafted examples along with representative cross sections of the mouldings that Mr. Hull is refering to. Overall, the book was informative but exceedingly overpriced give the content."
2,Puzzled...,I'm trying to replace the air filter for 2 window a/c units. The originals have a plastic frame & crossbars to help it slide into place. Does this new 'cut-and-fit' foam being sold everywhere have the density to slide into place?
5,This Book Will Never Age,"I have had this book so long I am afraid to let it go. Why? It remains relevant even with the changing times. It's a good read and a handy reference. Easy to understand, properly laid out, and full of the right kind of info a grant writer seeks. Can't go wrong for this price."
4,little yellow firetruck,my son loves this firetruck because it's yellow and not red like all the rest of his firetrucks. I was surprised it was so small. but he enjoys it anyway. Quick delivery - no problems
5,A Treasure,"If you have ever had a loss in your life, this beautiful album is a ""must have"". The emotional roller coaster of losing a loved one is captured, embraced and held up for the world to see. I really cannot describe how this music made me feel. It is just one of the very best works that I have ever owned. BUY THIS ALBUM!"
5,An amazing album,"... This is one of the most amazing albums I've ever heard, capturing all kinds of complex emotions in only 10 songs. What could be more encouraging than to hear such an accurate document of how hard life can be that is at the same time profoundly uplifting and beautiful? I'm so glad I discovered Cindy Bullens!"
4,Music for healing from Grief,"I found this music to be very upbuilding while grieving. Especially the song ""Better than I've ever been""."
2,Same old Style,"I've listend to this CD many times. It's good, but it's the same old style. What i mean is it's Lilith Fair material, and lots of people agree that there's too much of that already. I remember going to one of her concerts. The music doesn't match up with the body movin'. What i mean is, she was singing one of her regular songs, and headbanging to it! Headbanging belongs in a White Zombie concert, not a Cindy Bullons. If you like stuff like this, you should buy it. If not, go buy one of Pearl Jams bootlegs."
5,Inspiring and courageous ... just great music,"Cindy's power, courage and passion comes through crystal clear on this CD. I've already bought 3 copies for friends. If you've ever lost anyone in your life (and everyone will, sooner or later) this CD will give you hope and will help you find some peace. The fact that her talent shines through after such an anguishing loss is even more profound. The title track, ""Somewhere Between Heaven and Earth"", has a powerful message and the harmonies with Bryan Adams are uplifting, but my favorite is ""The End Of Wishful Thinking"" because it captures my feelings so well ... Great, Great Music ... Thanks Cindy"
4,bible code,"It is good. I specially like the hebrew and english concordance. The codes can be searched. I found names, but too many words are found to be useful.The matrix forms are interesting. The usefulness is in the hebrew and english bibles dictionaries concordances and databases."
1,Buyer Beware,Don't waste your money on this. I bought this and I can't look up any names or anything and the photo of it is misleading too!
5,Awesome!!!!,"This game is so rad, covers all sorts of mythology, so not only do you play the game, but you get to learn mythology while playing it, awesome job to the game developer of this game!!!!"
3,"Good Game, bad crashes","Over all, if you liked Diablo, you will love this game. However, be aware that a constant problem for lots of users is the game crashing and forcing the need to reboot your machine. I love playing it, but if I go 45 minutes without a crash, I am doing well. I would strongly suggest anyone interested in this game to do a search for the game and crash or freeze, and you will find a lot of message boards discussing this problem. The developer's forums show the company acknowledges the problem, and are unsure what is causing it.It probably plays fine for most people who own it, but I have never seen a game not in beta crash so much, nor have so many people online complaining about it as an unresolvable issue."
3,"Fun, but buggy","The game has ram problems. The longer you play, the slower it gets until any more than 2 enemies on the screen brings the game to a crawl. I have two gigs of DDR2, which should be plenty on an XP machine for this game (and no my computer isn't bogged down with spyware, viruses, etc.)Also, spells linked to the right mouse key won't always cast or won't cast immediately.The AI is pretty bad as well. You can often walk up to enemies before they even turn to attack you. That may be linked to the difficulty level however.Despite all this, I enjoy the game when I have the chance to play."
3,cool substitute!,this game is a good substitute for diablo 3. this is a cool game. specially if your all into greek myth. though i find kinda hard to get around places here. but overall its a good game.
4,"If you're a former dII player, this is it.",I used to play DI/DII/DII LOD. This games remind me of the good times. Very fun !
2,Unfinished and buggy.,"Be advised, this game is extremely crash prone and suffers from some extremely frustrating bugs - like character loss! The company admits to issues, and claims to be trying to fix them, but thus far they've done nothing.To top it off, there are big balance issues later in the game that clearly show the game was not fully play tested. Once again the developer claims to be working to address these issues - yet we see no patches to address them.The final nail in the coffin for this game is that it is short, expect only 3 hours to finish the main quest on normal, then you have to repeat the SAME GAME 2 more times to unlock all difficulty levels.What a stinker of a game."
4,Titan Quest,"A similar style and concept to Diablo. The effects are excellent and the story is fun. Unfortunately, there is so much stuff to pick up and sell and yet so very little to buy. Most of the armor and weapons I used were found rather than bought. I was hungry for more good loot as the game went on. Regardless, if you need a diablo fix, get this one."

3,"New bio good, but not great.","Howard Sounes' new Bukowski biography is much better than Cherkovski's BUKOWSKI: A LIFE, or Steve Richmond's self-serving SPINNING OFF BUKOWSKI; but it's still not great. He does dispel some of the Bukowski mythology (which Bukowski himself was the main promoter of) that has grown over the years. Unfortunately, he dwells too much on Bukowski's sex life, which can be read about in two fat Bukowski books (in every Bukowski book really) WOMEN and LOVE IS A DOG FROM HELL. This would be a good introduction for the uninitiated, but for Buk fanatics it's nothing new. Try Gay Brewer's wonderful CHARLES BUKOWSKI, for a more in depth (though somewhat academic) look at what Bukowski is important for: HIS WRITING! And for Bukowski's publishing history the forthcoming DESCRIPTIVE BIBLIOGRAPHY OF THE PRIMARY WORKS OF CHARLES BUKOWSKI by Aaron Krumhansl, will be indispensible."
2,A Jerry Springer style biography,"Cutting a drunken path, Bukowski shows people how to say ""no"" to the would-be puppet masters that would make them dance.There are, of course, other great writers who have carved their own place in literature but this biography gets so tangled in gossipy shallow stories and drunk escapades that I honestly think Howard Sounes has missed the point. I think he shoots only ankle-high on his subject. Obviously a great amount of research went into this book. Sounes can turn up facts the way some can turn up lawn trimmings. With the magnificent material he had to work with I was disappointed in his fixation with the sensational. Who cares if Bukowski drunkenly plowed it into some guy's rump mistakenly thinking the guy was a woman? I guess this sells books. If you really want to know the life, great humor, and importance of Charles Bukowski my advice is to go directly to the source. In years to come there will certainly be a much better biography than this effort."
1,Simply the worst,"They should have titled it ""Locked in the Arms of a Terrible Author."" That would have been a more fitting title for this aweful book."
4,Pure audio enjoyment,"We like to listen to audio books that are intriguing and/or entertaining without requiring more attention than is safe while driving. Nero Wolfe books are perfect. Michael Pritchard is the voice of these books and is perfect for the job. Not great literature, the Wolfe books are, for lack of a better term, good clean murders. I've had more than enough of the current popular gruesome serial killers, thank you."
3,Not stout's best,"See my review of the large print edition -- basically the solution doesn't make good sense. Still goood for fans of Wolfe and Archie, though.-DES"
5,mmmm strawberries!,"This is thick, but not greesy. I always get compliments on the way I smell. And this tub lasts a long time. I really love this stuff, and it really smells like strawberries! great mosturizer after shaving!"
1,This makes me sad :(,"Smells good in the container but as soon as I rub it on my skin it has a plastic weird smell to it, I do not recommend this product I was very disappointed."
5,Great love it,"I suffer from psoriasis, my new dermatologist directed me to buy a moisturizer with as much aloe vera as I could find. Since I don't like products with a lot of fragrance I opted for this body butter. Aloe is the first ingredient an this product doesn't fight with my perfume of I choose to wear some. It is awesome has really helps with the scaling and flaking, I am also doing light therapy and taking a prescription retinoid. It has done amazing things for my feet particularly my heals they get a little dry this time of year. I find I have to exfoliate less using this butter."
2,"Totally unimpressed, an overly rich and thick product","I tend to have very dry skin on my arms, and it's really hard for me to find a moisturizer because I can't stand how thick, gunky, and greasy most of them are. I got this product for free as a bonus for purchasing a certain amount at The Body Shop. I would have never bought this for myself, but decided to just use it since it was for free and if I didn't like it I would give it away. One night before bed I applied it to my arms and it was SO thick, so GREASY, the residue it left on my skin was horrible and I felt like none of it even sunk in. It was shocking. I tossed and turned all night and felt so disgusting. I can't believe people actually use this stuff! It's like applying lipstick to your skin basically. Do not recommend and will definitely give this away to a friend."
5,Wonderful Body Butter!,"I received this body butter as a promotional offer after buying $35.oo worth product from the Body Shop a few weeks ago (Fall 2009). I didn't expect much, because I have not used body butters in a very long time. But let me just tell you how amazing this cream is!!!! I absolutely love IT! After stepping out of the shower, you just need a dollop on your finger tips to get extreme moisture that lasts. It also has a lovely scent and gives your skin a glowy look. My skin is tight, bright, and super soft. Thanks for creating a wonderful product. I'm hooked!"
5,Perfect for After Sun Moisture,"I took the Moringa Body Butter on a weekend trip to Florida. It seems that no matter how much sun block you use it is never enough. Anyway, the burn was unbelievable. I used the butter immediately after showering and I slept well that night. It gave my skin a moist subtle feeling even after I burned the heck out of it. The incredible smell just adds to it."
1,"""Sweet lemon"" smells nothing like lemon.","So disappointed in the smell. It doesn't smell bad, but it doesn't smell good either, and it definitely does not smell like lemon. Blech. Returning it."
2,Love etc- strong fragrance,"This is too overpowring a fragrance I would like on any cream, lotion. Even my friends started asking what I had applied, cos it gave them a headache! I'm not buying this again ever. The moisturising is good though, probably another fragrance would have been good."
5,A gift for a friend who loves it.,I found this online and ordered it for a friend's birthday. She loves it and I had not been able to find it in a store.
5,"The best moisture for dry, very dry skin ever!","If you are like me who has dry skin to very dry skin and skin itches a little after you had a bath/shower this will definately be the right product for you! I tried so many stuff to get my skin soft and comfy but they didn't work! I even did some peels and used some medicated stuff but honestly still nothing helped! This amazing product made my skin soft and smelled really good after my baths/showers! I use the whole range of the Shea products shower cream, lotion, oil, scrub, body mist and body butter and I really love them all! My baths and showers became enjoyable cuz I can't stop loving the feeling of it on my skinI will cry if they discontinue this product as it is the best product that worked for me after spending a lot of money and time for years on useless products that didn't even help me or get me close to the result I'm getting from the Body Shop Shea Collection! I continue worrying about it being discounted one day!"
4,"Great lotion, but almond scent is VERY sweet","Body Shop Body Butter is a very thick, rich moisturizer. It has the texture of margarine, but ""Body Margarine"" does not have quite the same pleasant ring as ""Body Butter."" :) It absorbs quickly without any hint of greasiness.A word of note regarding the almond scent: it is VERY sweet-smelling, well beyond what I would have expected an almond scent to smell like. I don't mind it, but people who don't like overly sweet lotions should try another scent."
2,Its okay but...,"I use to use the Body Shops Coconut Body Butter. Its okay. But I find the price is too high. Your basically paying for big corp. So now I have found a new coconut butter at Trader Joes. At only 4.99 its fantastic. Smells like cake frosting! My daughter and I not only use it everyday, but we have to smell it too!! Goodbye Body Shop."
5,great product,"This does have a fragrance and I don't like any on my body, so I use this on my legs and it has made my legs feel softer"
1,Body shop love body butter -very dissapointed !,"I was very disapointed in the smell of love body butter, it smells like motor oil. and not like the product scent was discribed to be.I would not recommend this scent to any one."
3,Moisturizing Body Butter,Nice Butter cream but not my favorite scent; wouldn't purchase this again. The price was right and the service was great.
4,Just Short of Brilliant,"As a former Catholic, I enjoyed the original source material, an exhaustive expose of the Church's historically bloody past. In this documentary, the author expands on the book's subject matter with compelling interviews featuring various ""talking heads"" to reveal a Catholic Church and a Christian movement that continues to rival Islam in its militant, aggressive response to those who oppose their respective doctrines. I would like to give the doc five stars but Carroll defaults to his wimpy liberal roots when it comes to the nation of Israel. If it were left to Carroll, Israel wouldn't survive. Sorry, James, you can't support the Jews and not support their historic right and Biblical claim to the land that G-d game them."
2,Constantine's Sword - DVD,"I read Carroll's book and thought it was very informative. I bought the DVD hoping to see him expound on some of the themes in the book, but I was dissappointed to see that the documentary mostly looked at a few religious leaders and Carroll's trip to the Vatican.I loved the book, but the DVD is worth waiting until the price comes down."
2,More personal journey than documentary,"While I appreciate what Mr. Carrol is trying to do here, I think this film is better represented as a personal journey than as a documentary.Part of the problem is that the author tries to address too many ideas at once and ultimately fails to weave the various strands together into a compelling argument. These include family / personal issues, history of church violence, anti-Semitism, Viet Nam, and the infiltration of Christian fundamentalism into the Air Force Academy.As a documentary the film is all over the map, selective and limited in it's documentation, subjective in it's conclusions. The result is a flawed film that I would not be able to recommend.I hope Mr. Carroll is able to make peace with himself and with his God. I think that's really what this film is about."
1,"Indeed ""like the DaVince Code""","This DVD was recomended to me by a friend of a friend, I guess I should have investigated it more before purchasing. I would like to have known that it has very little to do with Constantine and nearly all to do with the Holocaust.With history used as a model for the story as opposed to seeking accuracy, it is close enough for laypeople to see it as accurate. The story comes across to me more as the journey of a single man going from extreme naivite to understanding that there are bad things in the world...and looking to lay the blame somewhere. If someone is looking for a reason to put down the church this is one to buy, if your looking for history of the church to make an informed decision I would suggest looking elsewhere."
5,A Film not to be Missed,"James Carroll's documentary, Constantine's Sword"", beautifully complements his important 2001 book of the same title. Narrator Carroll shows how anti-Semitism developed within Christianity after it became the official religion of the Roman Empire in the early 4th century, how it became lethal from then until the Holocaust, how the Nazis did not invent anti-Semitism but simply built on that toxic history, and how Church leaders did little to undo the damage until Pope John XXIII. Carroll also explores the mindset of the likes of fundamentalist leaders like Rev. Ted Haggard as they sought/seek to make the US Air Force Academy their mission field. This important film, which has unfortunately had far too little theater distribution, merits the widest possible circulation.-- Edd Doerr, President, Americans for Religious Liberty"
4,Excellent dreamy track,"This track, especially when remixed by lange is a perfect start to a good clubbing night. I recommend it for those who like speedy tracks."
3,Don't buy this from amazon,The calendar isn't fantastic and unless you really like the Simpsons you shouldn't buy it from here. Amazon.com charges way too much for this calender. I purchased the exact same calender in a local mall for only $3. It's much better than the 10.99 price that amazon.com charges.
4,Great Little Vacuum,"I bought this because with three cats and a baby, I don't want to be hauling out the big vacuum all the time. It works on carpets as well as bare floors. (I use it to get cat litter and pet hair out of the carpet and off the kitchen floor.) After about a year of use, the rotor brush started to die, so yesterday I bought an Oreck Cord-Free Electrikbroom Quick Stick thinking that might work better and last longer. I returned it today. The debris that it pulls up gets spit right back onto the floor you just cleaned. I am sticking with my Eureka The Boss and will buy a new one when the rotor brush goes for good."
1,Very Unhappy with Amazon,"I ordered this product through Amazon.com on December 12,2007. Should have had no problem getting it before Christmas. I recieved a shipping notification and a tracking number and they charged my credit card on December 12th. I waited and tried to track my item everyday up until Christmas Eve. They would not let me do a lost package claim and still tried to blame the shipper. On December 28, 2007 they changed their story and informed me the vacumn was no longer available and offereed me a credit towards a future purchase. I declined and told them I wanted a full refund or would dispute the charge with my credit card company. I received a credit but would be hesitant to buy from Amazon again. They lied and made up a tracking number when the item never actually shipped. I went to a rival site and got the item by overnight air, but not having the order to wrap for Christmas was wrong on all points. Marjorie Stasko."
5,Dennis Day sings Christmas is for the Family,"I grew up listening to this on an LP. I still have it, with pops and snaps, and last year had it converted to CD. It is a wonderful recording and lots of fun to listen to. It does bring back many memories."
3,O.K. but not outstanding,"If you are a Jackie Gleason fan, this tape may well be worth the purchase. I think Gleason hit his highest moments in the 50s vs. the 60s. Still, it was funny nontheless. I only bought this tape because it included a skit of The Honeymooners. It was funny but not the same; the 60s Honeymooners did not include Audrey Meadows and Joyce Randolph so I did not find the skit as good. (Sue Ann Langdon played Alice and Patrica Wilson played Trixie; note the cover on the video is wrong.) Buy a used copy as I did and you are better off."
5,Correction on cast,Note that Patricia Wilson and Sue Ann Langdon played Trixie and Alice in the Honeymooner's skit not Jane Kane and Sheila MacCrae as noted on the box.
1,Why is this NOT on DVD Amazon?,"This is a crying shame I can't watch Frank Fontaine as Crazy Guganhime & Jackie as Joe the Bartender. Some of the funniest stuff Jackie ever did. That's the ONLY reason I'm giving this a low rating. Otherwise, depending upon the content this would easily gets a 4 or 5 star rating."
2,Not worth the $30,"I expected a whole lot more from this book. The author gives some good advice but doesn't answer questions directly. He states not to do something, but doesn't explain what you should do instead. There is a lot of good basic information. This book has no meat to it though, it's just basic information. An example of this is, he gives you 30+ typical oral board questions, however, he doesn't give you any insight as to how to answer the questions/ what good answers would be. Another example is the typical question, why do you want to be a FF? The author states don't use the ""clone/ soap opera answer"": 'cause I like to help people...however, he doesn't give you suggestions as to a better way to answer or other answer possibilities."
3,beans,knew what I was ordering and the beans were still good but they arrived in dented cans. I believe the company is checking how they are packing for shipment.
2,O.k.,Not as pretty nor as detailed as cameos that I have purchased in the past. Rather disappointing.
5,Great traps,"When setting, the best way is with a rope. I keep hearing of folks fighting these traps and buying tools. They haven't always had tools. What you do is take a piece of rope say 3/8 to 1/2 inch cotton rope about 4 feet long. Tie a loop in one end and insert foot in loop, then run other end of rope through both eyes of one spring then take the same end and repeat that step and run through again the same way, then with foot in loop straighten leg and pull other end of rope and bingo spring is compressed with one hand lol, use other had to set the safety latch. Remove rope and repeat on other spring. That is how you set a conibear trap! And leave the safetys on both sides until your finished."
1,Rusted within a day or two,"My favorite groundhog nuisance has several holes in our acre yard. I put this trap at one of his holes, but he avoided it like the plague. Within a few days, it was rusted to the point that the trap would not even set off when I poked the trigger with a stick. So now it's off to recycling. If, as some commenters suggest, covering it with some primer is a good way to make it last longer, I suggest the manufacturers do so.And unlike some other commenter said, you DO want the setting tool. I'm a decent sized ex-offensive lineman and NCAA athlete, and my intelligence is not lacking. I had a very hard time setting this trap, and eventually went back to buy the setting tool. Now that's off to recycling too...I did catch a groundhog with a live trap a few weeks after I gave up on this one. Took about 5 days with the live trap, after 3 weeks without results with this one."
4,Review of Duke trap,I bought this trap because I have a Have-a-heart trap that the nuisance critters have gotten wise to. I wanted a trap that would offer a new presentation to them. I have two comments: 1) I have been weakened by some recent surgery and hospitalization and have found this trap to be very hard to set. I built myself a tool to set the trap and it is working quite well. 2) I am finding that it requires a very strong amount of effort for an animal to trigger it. The one animal that I trapped with it was a significantly large raccoon. I have had opossums come up to the bait and eat it right off of the trigger prongs without setting off the trap. (Note: I have an IR camera set up on the trap and can see the critters interact with the trap.)
4,Instructions?,"Never used a trap before, but I have a pesky woodchuck family that I can't get rid of. I'm sure it's a great product, and once I'm able to use it, I'm sure it will take care of my problem. It would have been nice to have instructions sent in the package though, that way I didn't have to look it up online"
2,Groundhog Trap,Would have been nice if the product included some instructions for setting the trap. No information whatsoever accompanied the product. Product was packed in a box without wrapping and was covered in grease.
2,We couldn't set it up,I have to admit that I still don't know how to set this tool up after I bought it one month ago. It's very dangerous when I tried to set it up. I guess I will gave it up.
3,not for woodchucks,I bought this trap for woodchucks. The trap is to small a larger one is necessary but I would recommend a foot trap for wood chucks. this trap does not measure up to the spring loaded foot traps when trapping chucks/goafers. I posted a link to one belowDuke Coil Spring Trap
4,A good read,"I really enjoyed this book. There are some typographical errors that get in the way at first, but you just have to overlook them. The story is excellent. It really draws you in and the characters are very well developed."
4,A must for gear heads...,"Apart from being no slouch on bass, John Entwistle (the former bass player with The Who) was a renowned collector of guitars and basses.At the time of his death in 2002 he owned approximately 200 instruments. Some of them were integral to The Who's enduring contribution to rock - song's like ""My Generation"" and ""Won't Get Fooled Again"". Others are rare vintage Fenders, Gibsons, Rics, etc. Of course there are a few Alembics.John had been working with a photographer to catalogue and photograph his collection and had written the introduction and descriptive notes to a book which has now been published.A must for anyone interested in electric guitars or basses. Could be your only chance to see a Gibson Moderne, Fender Swinger or Alembic Narrow V."
5,Electric Bass History in Pictures,"Well, as a bass player, a Who fan and a John Entwistle fan, I don't think it would be too surprising that I love this book. But, think it's the bass player in me that makes it so great. Seeing the evolution of the electric bass in print is very interesting. I really love the picture of one of the original 5 Fender Basses. WOW!!!!As a stand-up player, I own similar books for the double bass. This book can easily compare with them. Only they don't have such great humor in the form of John's notes about the instruments. BTW, I didn't think that the electric bass existed in hell (have to read the book to understand this one)."
2,Not so great ...,"This book was far to autobigraphical and the author's attempts to generalize her experience felt shallow. I lost my only brother to suicide not long before reading the book. It just didn't bring me any solace or increase my understanding.On the other hand, I also read ""No Time to Say Goodbye"" and even though it was not aimed at siblings-only, I found it very helpful. Perhaps it was a matter of not just focusing on one single person's story."
4,Good Info. but hard to read soon after the tragedy,"The book is full of good information for siblings of a suicide victim but is very difficult to read shortly after the tragedy. The first chapter tells in detail the story of a young college student's sister's suicide. It is hard to keep reading the book because of the emotions it evokes. The rest of the chapters are not so hard if you can just get past the first chapter. So don't stop reading, even if it is tough."
4,Do they have bad days in heaven? surviving the suicide loss of a sibling.,"So very little is available about the subject of sibling suicide, I was not aware how big of a problem we are facing until it hit close to home, this books are so very helpful, they have been for me. I am still in the process of coping and trying to understand why, it's all so very raw and sad but the books have helped me a great deal."
4,PUT IT on DVD already come ON,"Yet another great animated TV series that's under appreciated by distributors and creators why? I liked it, and I'm sure that a lot of other kids and adults would still enjoy this series if only creators, and distributors would just lighten up and work something out so people can again enjoy great cartoons like this oneI hope that one day very soon that Noozles, and Grimms fairy tale classics will be released on DVD, and given the proper respect that they deserveIt seems strange that an animated series that was once on main stream cable TV and loved by thousands would not get released on DVD all over as it should beBut to those of you who don't care what format the series is in and just want to see Noozles again you might wanna hurry, and get this because who knows how long the VHS will even be available gee! sigh! makes no sense that so many other cartoon classics are on DVD but not this one."
4,Moonlight Review,"This is a great movie it's excellent in quality, and has an excellent fight scene in it. The fight is with Gina an asassin who uses shino-ipo to paralyze the victaims only to slaughter them. When he finds Kenshin he challenges him to a battle. Kenshin accepts even though he knows he can't beat him since leaving battousai the man slayer in the past, so Kenshin tries to awaken the legendary battousai that is inside of him to kill Gina."
5,Stroke of Luck,"I always have been a big anime fan, and one day I just happened to be at my good friends house, and her sister brought home this DVD for us to watch. Neither of us had ever heard of it before, but we gave it a shot. Lucky thing that we did! We both fell head over heels in love with this DVD, as it flawlessly combines humor, action, a great storyline, and characters you can really share some empathy with! So if you're looking for something interesting and easy-to-follow, I greatly recommend Rurouni Kenshin. If you have Cartoon Network, they play the series on Toonami every weekday."
5,Gotta LOVE Rurouni Kenshin......,This is one of my favorite discs in this very well made anime series! This buyer was very prompt in shipment and notifications...will use them again!
4,Rurouni Kenshin - Great Series,"This is Volume 2 of the Rurouni Kenshin Series. This DVD is one of my favorites ( then again, all of them are my favorites ) because of the fighting sequences and introduction of new, main, characters to this series. In addition to the great stories and artwork, we have a glimpse at the relationship between Kaoru and Kenshin. Plus, the music selection is great. I think the pieces they have really suits the mood of the scene. The DVD contains 4 Episodes: Episode 5 is a continuation of Zansa, fighter-for-hire, Story Arc in which his past is made known to Kenshin. Episode 6-7 is the Kurogasa Story Arc in which Kenshin must come to terms with his past as a manslayer. Episode 8 is the beginning of the Oniwabanshu Story Arc."
5,This is an awsome cd for belivers of Christ!,"I love this album and the rest of his music, but this CD ministers to my spirit unlike any of his previous albums. I think it a wonderful album."
4,When things go wrong....,"Tragic is the key word in this title -- needless might have been another. A good example of how experienced people can make horrible decisions, the contentious expedition to Nanda Devi is recounted here. While not ""Into Thin Air"", there is a quality to this book lacking in Krakauer's Hollywood production that is appealing to me."
4,A self-serving book,"As an avid reader of mountain books, this is one of the better ones. The story of the ascent of Nanda Devi and the unfolding tragedy is a compelling one. That being said, I have read other accounts of this expedition, and of other expeditions that included John Roskelly, and it is obvious that the author has very much climbing skill and very little emotional intelligence. This version is self-serving, and it is doubtful that it represents anything other than his perspective. One thing that is glaringly obvious- Roskelly's complete lack of respect for the Unsoeld family and their values, his distain for women (except the kind he can control), and his lack of interest in anything other than the summit.Who knows what effect this had on the expedition's outcome? I sincerely hope he has grown up by now."
1,very disappointed!,"One of the reasons I'm a huge fan of this soulful group, is the silky smooth soulful falsetto of the lead singer. Clearly, this is not the same guy and definitely not the same vocal style. The group may include a couple of the original members of the group,which might explain the back up vocals, which was not too shabby. I felt like I was in a Karoke bar and could not get past the first three songs. Save your money and listen to the CD, ""If your ready: The Best of Enchantment"" instead. You'll definitely get your money's worth."
4,Real Nice,"I just rec'd this dvd and I realy enjoy it. Even tho the lead singer (EJ) voice is not as sharp when he starded with the group,it's nice to listen to. The vocal background still has that soulful emotional sound.The three orginal members performing are Joe Thomas,Mickey Clanton and Emanuel Johnson.They can sill stirr the soul."
1,flimsy easily got pinctured.,It started leaking within one year. I used it only on carpeted surface. It lasted only for 3-4 uses. I wouldn't wast my money on this.
4,The first level is a lot of fun!,"This game seems a whole lot of fun, but the problem is, I cannot seem to get past the first level. The difficulty is very high on this side scrolling beat'em up, so be warned if you want to see the ending it will not be easy, and you will need to practice the game a lot"
2,Did not work for me,I had this heart rate monitor for 7 days. The first couple of days it worked fine then it just stopped transmitting. I tried everything and it just did not work. The watch itself was fine. I ended up sending it back and paying the little bit extra for a polar.
1,Having difficulty setting this up...,"My wife received this heart rate monitor from me for Christmas 2005. First my wife, them my father in law and then finally I have been unable to get the chest strap to begin transmitting to the wrist watch. We have read the documentation and looked at the Timex web page without success so far. It is now January 2nd and I still cannot get it working. I may change my review later if I find this is all due to operator error, but at this point three well educated people have been unable to figure it out. At the very least there is a problem with either ease of use or documentation.In the Fitness Sensor User Guide there are pieces listed that are not in my box. However, the web page does not mention them. I suspect the guide is an older version. If not, perhaps there has been a shipping error. In any case, I am not happy."
3,Reception Difficulties,"While value priced, I've had great difficulties getting the monitor to recognize a signal from the chest band transmitter. Instructions tell you to wet the receptor pads but even that doesn't work well. I've had somewhat better luck using baby oil but all too often it still takes me upwards of five minutes of trying to get a signal to the wrist monitor -- and then its still sometimes droppped during my workout! Very annoying."
5,Good advice and examples to help you get started.,"Not only does Liz Folger offer good practical advice about starting and running a home-based business, but her sources and profiles are so real and compelling that she also motivates the reader to get started.More than just a ""how to"" book, Folger's use of real world examples helps the first time work-at- home mom better understand the steps required for success.As a 9 year work-at-home veteran, I found this book to ring true. It may not always be easy, but when you hit the right type of business that matches your skills and interests, it is very rewarding.Take her advice to heart and go after your dream as all those in her book have already done!"
2,Chicken soup for the soul is better,"This book is more about feel good stories of people who started a business and they liked what they were doing. If you liked Chicken Soup for the Soul, you will probably like this. I was looking for a book to give some ideas of what good businesses someone could do part-time and make some extra money. These stories covered various set up costs and barely gave an idea of what is needed. The book basically sums up to be: Find out what you like and make a plan. If you already figured that out, don't buy the book."
3,Very little info of what is needed to start a business,Very little info of what is needed to start a business. This book basically told stories of people who started a business and how they liked what they were doing. More on the lines of Chicken Soup for the Soul. The stories covered various set up costs but hardly gave any ideas of what is needed to start a business.
3,This not just for Mom but for every woman.,"This is a great book for someone who would like to start working out of their home. You do not have to be a ""Mom"" to reas, understand and use this book. Liz Folger does dirrect her book at woman who are mothers, but because of the way Ms Folger has written her book, it is very easy to scrim passed all the Mom information . There are some great tips on how to get started, the does, the don'ts and the scams as well as website addresses for a variety of related subjects. There is also an entire section in the book devoted to Home bussiness ideas . This has profiles of people who have started a bussiness and tips on How To start your own bussiness. The book is easy reading for anyone."
3,A helpful and general-based book.,"It's an okay book, I thought it would be more descriptive about building up jobs from the home but it only provides general ideas about various jobs. Fortunately, I purchased it used and got a good deal, otherwise not worth the regular price."
4,Book of knowledge,I haven't gotten a chance to read all it but the book was in good condition and I got it quickly at a great price. What I've read so far its has a lot of information. I can't wait to finish it.
1,NOT for the professional woman,"I agree with the other reviewer that there isn't much here for the degreed professional who wants to do what they've been trained (and love!) to do. I'd love to see a book on how to translate one's degreed expertise into a home-based business. How about a geophysicist who manages to use her science training to do something at home, rather than some craft-y type thing? I'd love to see a book for the professional woman wanting to work-at-home -- this book is not it."
5,"Yes, you can make money from home",This is a great book for those who want to look at various options of making money from home. Very sound advice with samples and guidance to various career options. I highly recommend this book.
2,SAVE YOUR CASH,"After their excellant collection of eps which later became 'road music' this there first album is a real disapointment, having had the cd since it was released and gave it many spins it simply hasn't clicked , the first three tracks are ok 'wheels' being the best , but nothing here is as memorable as 'shadow of a man'or 'tell it like it is' from 'road music' so do yourself a favour and check out 'road music' first."
2,Great Expections,The game stated great however as you went on it became harder and harder till it was near impossible to win.
3,Thriller in cyberspace,"In the not-so-distant future, India Carless, known as Trouble, has left the shadowy world of cyberspace after the American government cracks down on netwalkers like her. A few years later, a new hacker pops up using the name 'Trouble' and begins creating havoc. The original Trouble comes back to clear her name and catch this new upstart, and she reconnects with old friends to do so, including Cerise, the woman she walked out on. Trouble finds a changed cyberworld hiding more dangers than she anticipated. For me the hard sci fi aspects were a bit dry, but Scott compellingly addressed various social issues and created intriguing characters ... that compelled me to continue. And I do agree that it went on too long and the ending is a bit disappointing, but overall I did enjoy the book. I like Melissa Scott's approach, so I'll probably read more by her."
2,Intriguing but unsatisfying and somewhat tedious,"Like Trouble, I finished this book wholly unsatisfied. The denouement left several plot points completely unresolved and screams sequel. Although Scott's characters engage the attention, her endless descriptions of netwalking become quite monotonous. Because the adversaries are not full characters but constructs, when Cerise and Trouble finally vanquish them, it's just not very interesting. This book put me to sleep several times!"
3,didn't catch my interest,"I love sci fi with strong active women, realistic women though, women I can relate, and men I can relate to. However, this book I could not relate too. Perhaps I'm not into computers enough, perhaps the first chapter where ""her friends"" (?are they?) talk about her not being there and about new laws was just too boring, or perhaps the book is too much into telling me what is going on in the realworld compared to showing me what is going on in cyberspace. Whatever it was, this book did not catch my interest, did not make me want to keep reading. But I did read it because it was a gift. If you like cyberpunk or computers please strong women and men, then you might get more out of this book than I did."
5,"A touching story, perfect for loved ones who live far away","Beautiful little book. Each verse is just so sweet. I gave this book to my (adult) best friend when she moved 2500 miles away, and she cried when she read it. It's a great way to confirm your love for your child, but the message is ageless- give it to anyone whom you love. Nice, rich pictures, too."
1,Defective item - No subtitles,"Note: This is not a review of the movie itself.The DVD is advertised (even in its case) as providing subtitles for English, French and Spanish. Yes, the subtitle menu exists but they DO NOT work."
3,"Overrated, Overdone, Overacted and Over the top...","Boogie Nights is a fair movie, but not nearly as constrained and interesting as Anderson's best film -- Hard Eight. Burt Reynolds leads the cast. He is exceptional, I will admit. Many of PT Anderson's usual cast are around -- and most are decent in their roles. The story is tiresome, and the idea that ""porn stars are people, too"" or that ""good people do bad things"" -- is constantly crammed down our necks. It is neither subtle or restrained, but self-absorbed. I will say this, it is not as self-absorbed as Anderson's atrocious ""Magnolia.""See Boogie Nights if you are a film fan - miss it if you are prudish. There were some great moments, but the movie is ultimately bogged down by its vastness.See Hard Eight. See Boogie Nights. Skip Magnolia."
5,Great Movie,This was a great movie. For anyone interested in the life of a porn star from beginning to end. It shows the ups and downs throughout the life of a porn star. Great acting and believable. Mark Wahlberg is excellent.
5,A Must Have On Blu-Ray,"With this purchase, I have a new appreciation for a great movie. Boogie Nights is another solid picture from Paul Thomas Anderson and after this buy, I own all of his movies. It's a plus that I get to own this on blu-ray, since no store I went to carried the movie whatsoever. I highly recommend this product, as well as the seller. Movie arrived fast and in perfect condition."
4,Pretty damn good movie.,"This is the story of the porn industry in the 70's. Many think of this as a Porno movie. But it's really not that bad. P.T. Anderson has done a great job with this. Great acting and everything. The music is awesome too.This is the story of a young man (Mark Whalberg) who is pulled into the porn industry by a porn directory (Burt Reynolds). The world is good to him for a while. Then it turns around on him. This movie is not only interesting and a nice piece of 70's nostalgia. It shows you that money, fortune, fame, sex, and good looks won't get you anywhere. Well it might...but...you see what I'm saying. Also stars Heather Graham, Julianne Moore, William H. Macy (who should've gotten an award for his role in this film), Philip Seymour Hoffman, and many more."
4,Entertaining........to a point,"The first half of this movie is very entertaining, with many memorable and funny lines of dialogue. The problem I had with the movie is that the characters have little or no redeeming qualities to appreciate them for 2 and a half hours! IF you can put that aside, as well as the porno topic in general, the movie succeeds rather well. Having grown up in that era, the music in Boogie Nights is exceptional, and provides a great atmosphere to the movie in particular. What a GREAT group of songs! Had these songs not been a part of this movie, I believe it would not be as well-received as it has been. The music adds SOOOOOO much.The DVD is a real treat regarding the video and audio. Near perfect on both counts truly adds to the enjoyment of the movie.No masterpiece here, but ignoring the subject matter and some of the things that are peripheral to it (re: drug abuse, violence), then Boogie Nights is an entertaining affair."
5,Terrific Period Piece,"""Marky Mark"" Wahlberg (I'll bet he hates that by now) is Dirk Diggler (the man with the 13-inch talent), but Julianne Moore shows off more than just her skin in an Oscar-nominated performance that encompasses all the emotions. Writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson deftly juggles over a dozen major characters in this story of the ups and downs of the minds and bodies behind the adult film industry of the late 70's and early 80's. The also nominated Burt Reynolds finally shows everyone else what many knew--he doesn't always have to play ""Burt Reynolds."" Watch out for Michael Penn (folk-rock singer and the film's composer) and Robert Downey, Sr., in the music studio."
3,Boogie Nights,"Boogie Nights is a funny Movie, I liked it a lot.. walberg was good and the characters were funny,,,,T & A can't go Wrong."
1,Boogie Nights(Region2),"I have seen this movie before and I enjoyed it, that's why I ordered it, to add to my collection. I could not view this when I got it. It says INVALID REGION CODE and would not play, I don't know what that means I've never had the problem before viewing a movie. I just wasted my money on this since I can't watch it."
1,What a lemon!,"Boogie nights. Ñ This has got to be the stupidest story I have ever seen. As a movie, some people claim it has merits. Whatever these merits may be, I fail to see them, and anyway they are totally nullified by the incredible mindlessness of the characters portrayed. How could anyone with a minimum of common sense empathize with people of that sort? Barnyard animals behave better and more rationally. Ñ And so, for fear I might die in an accident and people would find this DVD in my collection, I've taken care to thoroughly destroy it and throw it in the garbage where it belongs, Ñ no matter how heavy the price I had been stupid enough to pay for it."
1,Alas Babylon!,"After many years of knowledge about this movie, I finally watched it. Mark Wahlberg, despite a previous prejudice because of his prurient beginnings, is the only redeeming part of this dubious ""prodigal son"" theme cast in a pornographic movie about the sad human condition that always has and always will be a force to be dealt with in our world. However reviewed or perceived, this was, to me - and I was very much a real part of the era spotlighted here - a far too graphic and overwhelming portrait to be edifying, if indeed this was, at least, one of its purposes!"
1,Definetely Not One I'd see again,"This has got to be the worst film I have ever seen. I can't believe most people are rating it five stars.The films acting is really cheap and some scenes are really long and boring the film just doesn't make sense.Personally, i'd rather go outside and watch the grass grow than see this garbage!"
5,In my top 10 of all time,"I've been waiting for years for this movie to be released on Blu-Ray, and have been counting the days since I found out it finally was being released in high def. picture and sound. Paul Thomas Anderson's darkly funny and disturbing look at the 1970's early porn scene in Los Angeles, is one of his best piece's of work that will make you want to take a shower after you watch. P.T. Anderson pulls out a bag of film school tricks in this piece of art. Great cinematography, dark storyline, and a fun soundtrack make this a must watch for any person that enjoys movies."
5,Greatest Film Ever Made!,"I am a firm believer that Boogie Nights is in fact the greatest film ever made. Every performance is superb; the direction is outstanding; the styling is flawless.But what really makes this odd film work so seamlessly is in the way it portrays community so wholly and so beautifully. For all intents and purposes you shouldn't like these people, but you can't help but love them.The ensemble cast is amazing, the standout being Julieanne Moore, heartbreakingly good as the troubled porn star den-mother, Amber Waves.This Blu-Ray is a must for any fan of the film. The vision and sound quality is fantastic, and the extras are fascinating, particularly the John C Reilly 'behind the scenes' stuff.Get it - get it now!"
4,a great ensemble film,"A fascinating study of the human character, an interplay of a thousand stories, that's really one story, a portrayal of an industry and a parody of the said industry at the same time - this is P>T. Anderson's best movie. Mark Wahlberg is remarkable in it, but so is the rest of the cast. Julianne Moore, Burt Reynolds, John C. Reilly, Philip Seymour Hoffman, and Heather Graham all give outstanding performances."
5,THE film of the 90s,"I saw this not knowing what to expect because of the subject matter. What I saw is possibly one of the most original, funny, violent and sexy movies ever.Mark Wahlberg really can act!!!!! Boogie Nights is EVERYTHING Pulp Fiction TRIED to be. I think Quentin Tarantino should take a leaf out of PTA's book. This is master film-making.I personally love how the end of the 70s and beginning of the 80s is filmed - pure perfection, charting the change in music from disco to rock, and the change in the movie industry from film to videotape. I recommend this to anyone!!!"
4,review,This was a great movie and I like movies that star Mark Wahlberg anyway. It is a terrific story and a good movie to watch
4,"Absorbing to watch, quite poignant at times","It's a touch too long - the movie, that is, not the appendage that made Dirk Diggler famous - but this is a still a movie that keeps your attention throughout. The characters are very realistically drawn and - like those horrid clothes and hairstyles! - evoke the atmosphere of the 1970s extremely well. It is in no way a voyeuristic movie. The measure of its success is that the viewer is compelled to sympathise with poor Dirk. This is also Burt Reynolds' best movie since Deliverance."
3,it had promise...,"...if only the story didn't fall apart in 100 different directions after a tight first hour. It started cohesively enough, but then it started rambling on and on until the end when Wahlberg talked to his privates.5 stars for the first hour, one star for everything after."
5,Boogie Nights:The Very Best,"I have to admit,it doesn't get much better as far as films go when it comes the smash Boogie Nights. Paul Anderson does a wonderful job of writing and directing. As for the acting, it's superbly done. Hats off to Anderson on a well acted and well directed movie. 5 stars. It's fantastic from beginning to end. Bill RObinson,Genius at Work"
5,Hilarious Movie,"I don't know if most people would classify Boogie Nights as a comedy but it is in every since of the word. It is able to take such serious subject matter and make a great comedy into it. My favorite scene is where Mark Wahlberg is trying to cut a record after the demise of his porn stardom. His singing is so bad, you wonder how he could stand to intentional do that, being a former recording artist. There are many of the same great moments which I felt totally made fun of the pornography business. People in that business think they are real actors and take themselves so seriously. That's what is so funny about it all."
5,Outstanding,"This movie, which is partially based on the life and times of John Holmes is a startling and provocative look at the adult film industry in the late 70's and early 80's. OUTSTANDING performances throughout from Moore, Reynolds, Wahlberg, incredible characters they do.If youre looking for a stunning, revealing, and dramatic look at the adult film industry, go pick it up. Its outstanding."
3,The New Boogie Nights DVD!,"The Martin Scorsese of my generation! A ""Goodfellas"" for the Porn industry! What a great movie! I'm going to talk a little about the new DVD. First, if you have the old one, DON'T BUY THIS, rent it! Why, because it's pretty much the same. Sorry folks, the extra commentary and few deleted scenes don't make this worth buying a second time around. The most interesting thing about this DVD is the CAR CRASH/BECKY WIFE BEATER scene..... that itself, is worth a rental.Pleast PTA, release this again with ""Dirk Diggler Story"" and that ""John Holmes"" documentary... especially if you want us to get our money's worth."
5,A film you must see before you die,"One of my favorite films of the last 20 years. Funny, sad, wildly bravevisually. This is brash, bold filmmaking, featuring amazing use ofmusic - both period songs and score.Somehow this manages uses the world of porn film-making to examinefamilies, American politics in the 70s and 80s and all sorts of seriousthemes while also being a flat out blast to watch. It was criticized abit on release for plagiarizing Scorsese, especially 'Goodfellas', butto me this is homage in the best sense. Taking great work done byothers and building on it to create something new. Indeed, theexcitement I had on first seeing it reminded me of my first falling inlove with Scorsese's kinetic work as a young film fan many years ago.I'd suggest you get the Blu-Ray or at least the 2 disc DVD set.The extras are everything extras should be - fun, interesting,informative. A film well worth owning."
5,boogie nights,great movie! a fun look thru the window of time at the 70's and 80's. great acting on everyone's part in the movie.
1,Overrated garbage,"This movie is overrated. Bold, daring - yes. Well done - no.The first hour or so is a so-so movie with a daring topic. It then goes downhill into a complete waste of time. It tries to be arty, but only succeeds in the modern sense that only the ""artist"" can see the art in it.Don't waste your time."
2,Boogie Nights described in one word-- overrated,"I have no idea why this movie is so appealing to everyone. Another reviewer thought the characters in this movie were more likeable than those in Magnolia. I think the characterization in Magnolia is its major strength. In Boogie Nights I'm not sure which character was in the least bit likable even less respectable except for William Macy, Burt Reynolds, and the guy who opens the stereo store(sorry forgot his name). Mark Walbergh's character was pathetic. He's arrogant, shallow, and doesn't have any recognizably good qualities. Walberg's acting isn't anything special either. I was expecting more from the this movie after all the talk I've heard."
4,I gave Boogie Nights a second chance... and changed my mind,"I didn't give it a fair chance. My first review of Boogie Nights was extremely negative. I have since viewed the movie again, paying closer attention, and have arrived at a different conclusion. Boogie Nights is very unique. At first it's a parody of the porn industry and one director in particular, played by Burt Reynolds. The Donnie Wahlberg character is most likely based on the late (and great) John Holmes. As Boogie Nights proceeds, that which was flippant and funny in the beginning gradually turns ugly and dark and violent. I'll say no more other than: yes, Boogie Nights does have ""redeeming social value.""Personally speaking, it baffles me how adult movie stars can be so nonchalant about performing all types of sexual acts in a studio, under the bright lights, with a yelling director and a dozen or so crew members looking on. It must not take long to get over that embarrassed feeling. Boogie Nights illustrates that point quite well."
5,like riding the bus?,"or going to work/school?and i quote:"" I thought that I had fallen asleep during this film and missed some important scenes, but no, I was conscious throughout. If I had the choice I would have opted for the unconscious state of mind whilst this film whirled round my dvd player. The film just did not have any flow, it was just scenes, and boring scenes at that. You did not get to know any of the characters so could not sympathise with what was going on. ""go figure."
3,"Movie great, but beware: there are 2 different DVD versions!","Ok, I loved the movie, but I am angry! The movie surely rates a 5 but the DVD is another thing...A few months after I bought this movie on DVD, a ""Platinum"" edition came out with a load of features at about the same price. Sure, I'm happy that film companies are going all out, taking advantage of the format and offering these super-packed DVDs, but why do they release the bare-bones version? I'm sure many would refrain from buying a given title if they knew that a premium version was in the works. Hmmm, I guess that's what we should all do, hold off on newly released DVDs for a few months until the premium version comes out (or doesn't).So, in conclusion: be careful - get the platinum edition! I probably will, too..."
2,Boggie Nights,"Don't wasdte your money getting the second disc, if you want to waste your time then do so.its a REAL 'B' movie at best. just can't watch it the second time.write must be one from Public SchoolSave Your MoneySeller was FAST on Delivery"
4,It was good,"It was good; not the very best I've seen, but the the worst, there was a few bad reviews but; nope it was okay, it had a few funny part, others were intense, others sad, some happy; had a little of everything. I do not know if I will watch it again; but it wasn't as bad as the bad reviews wrote."
4,compelling,"Although the movie is long, it never drags. The vignettes about the characters' lives are interesting, and the characters themselves are surprisingly likeable. But it does seem like two movies: the lighthearted first part and the second part, when things take a dark turn. Both sides of the story are necessary as they give a more complete picture of the porn industry and the people involved in it. But I think that some of the violence towards the end is unnecessary and not fully explained. Other than that, however, the movie is worth watching."
4,the parable of the bad son played in porn industry of the 70's,"This review refers to the movie and not the dvd productIndeed, there are many sub-plots that fuse into this film. At face value, you may be lost by the fact that is a story of an edowed male porn star that becomes an overnight star in his media and the action style martial art heroe that he manages to create as well... yet the movie is about the collective soul of the group who is united under the porn production leadership played, superbly, by Burt Reynolds... this small little odd group is not ill spirited, but indeed misguided, yet there is respect among its members, there is a sense of honor and Burt reynolds acts as the merciful father (of the gospell parable) as he takes his astrayed son back again... yet the finacer of the movies is accused of pedofile charges, he is cast out of his beneficieries and suffers miserably in jail."
1,Dosent play.disappointed,"Dosent play,some code restriction.not sure what this means I just know its useless to me.I was so dissatisfied with this purchase."
3,querky commedy,"I like this movie. I would say it's a little retro. You can watch it with older family members, too. There's more drug use than actual nudity and sex, so you decide. It's about getting your big chance, taking that ride downhill and getting back up. The storyline is good, not overly complicated. It's a pretty good find."
3,Don't know...,"I enjoy films that depict this epoch and this one relived this period quite and parts of it were very engaging. But I am against all forms of pornography and I do not support movies that show drugs, violence because these do not contribute to a better society and young people who see movies with violence and drugs, etc., get wrongly influenced."
3,"Fast Delivery, Not Exactly What I Had In Mind.","The special edition DVD i recieved is the Canadian version and the title and back are in spanish. I guess this is why i got it on such a great sale, but it would have been nice if the seller mentioned this information. It came in good speed. I really have no complaints except the excluded information from the seller."
4,Good Movie.. Poor DVD information,"What can I say about this movie... This is an excellent movie. The cast, the plot, everything is great. I love this movie!!Unfortunately, this DVD doesn't come with subtitles, neither English, French or Spanish.. Information should be corrected on the box of the DVD"
4,Better than Magnolia,"Paul Thomas Anderson's latest film 'Magnolia' was the subject of Oscar rumors - and deservedly so, with awesome performances from Tom Cruise, Melora Walters and many of the other six billion cast members. 'Boogie Nights', on the other hand, attracted attention for its risque subject matter - but I feel it's a better film, with a tighter structure and a cast of characters you end up caring about. John C. Reilly, Burt Reynolds, William H. Macy and Mark Wahlberg are all excellent. The gorgeous Heather Graham doesn't get a chance to shine as Roller Girl, but she's better suited to this sort of picture than the sublime-but-ridiculous Austin Powers 2. And the use of music is just superb - the pumping 70s soundtrack will satisfy lovers of the Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction OSTs."
1,The most over-rated film ever!,"I can think of no other film that has received so much praise that I hated so much. The goofy dialoge, the empty characters and the gratuitous violence had me enraged. P.T. Anderson rips off Martin Scorcese at every turn, and the story moves at a snail's pace. I felt no sympathy/empathy for any of the characters. This movie is based on scumbag John Holmes, and anybody that knows the truth about him should be seething at the fact that a movie has been made glorifiying his life. Finally, this film is just plain boring. I rented this movie with the highest expectations, but an hour into it, I was watching the timer on the VCR wondering when this abomination of film making was going to end. This is the worst film I've ever seen. Sure, the acting and production values in 'Plan 9 From Outerspace' are infamous, but 'Boogie Nights' left me angry."
1,Boogie Nights Is A Cure For Insomnia,"To be truthful I ordered this film, because I had heard it was roughly based on the life of porn star John Holmes. I doubt there is much about Holmes in this movie, but I can't say for sure, because it is so boring I fell asleep a couple of times.Burt Reynolds won his Oscar for this performance, but I can't imagine how. I can think of several actors who would have been as good as Burt, and many that would probably have been better, because the role doesn't demand much of an actor.Mark Wahlberg was good as the young man in the movie, but he's been much better in several other movies.Save your money. You've been warned. I rate this movie s-s-s-s-s!"
1,bad!,"although I haven't seen any other of J.TT aor whatever the hell his name is films, judging by this I can say that he hasn't an original bone in his body. Scorsese, Altman, and of course Tarantino, there all here in bastardized form. Its almost kind of fun to watch wich director hes ripping of with each scene. I think I even caught a little Steven soderberg in one scene, now that caught me off guard.Marky mark is the cinematic equivalent of watching a guy with a bag over his head bob for apples."
1,Boogie Nights This film would not play.,We tried it on all three of our DVD players and it would not play. I responded to this before but nothing was done about it. I would not order from this vendor again.
4,Good but too bad and weird!,"This was, the weirdest movie i've ever seen, well PT Anderson did a good job, with Magnolia but this was way too gross and weird......."
4,it's porn......AND it's funny - what else do you want?,"Boogie Nights is a movie that combines elements of porn and comedy, while under the pretense of a serious movie. On the whole the movie entertained quite well, but the shlong scene at the end was unnecessary."
4,"Strange, at times dark and often very funny.","If you like watching strange almost circus like people struggle through life than you should enjoy this movie. I find most hollywood 'blockbuster' movies to be trash, poor writing and unsympathetic characters, poor acting and plotting. this is definitely a step above. The movie is really kind of taking the piss on the porn industry by portraying most of the people as a little slow and yet thoroughly convinced of their talent and their art. It's also kind of nostalgic for anyone who lived through the 70's and early 80's. There is a scene where the main character and his buddy are trying to cut a rock record after having a fight with their porno director, very funny. I can't see this as ever being a popular main stream movie, but if you like most so called cult films you should enjoy this. should be a 'cult classic' in no time"
4,"THis movie was good, but lacked something.",The movie was a good one. It displayed the true life of a porn star. We all have our beliefs that porn stars live a 24/7 life of sex. This is mnot true and this movie shows it. I suggest that anyone go and see it if they have bad feelings toward porn stars.
1,Horrible,"What can I say, I can't even open the enclosure to test it! There's something rattling around inside!It's not eSATA, it's External SATA, meaning it's no good with eSATA plugs like on TiVo or my Cosmos computer case. The tiny, blurry ""manual"" which is a single page folded in half doesn't describe how to open the case, so I can't even test it, not that I want to. The product page says it supports SATA II and over 500GB drives while the box says 500GB max and makes no mention of SATA II.Flimsily made, packaging not worthy of CompUSA-branded products, and of course my personal inability to open the case, makes this one a big-time loser."
1,HIRAX MUST BE DESTROYED....,"i felt i must warn the uninitiated here - hirax has one of the worst all-time vocalists.if you can take more than about 20 seconds of it,you are a rare individual"
4,Beautesque!,"I actually bought the CD simply for Lorraine Bowen's hypnotic Julie Christie... the aura it evokes is so pleasantly reminiscent of a David Lynch film... surreal, ethereal, a joyful ribbon of a melody wafting inside a unique dimension that only exists as the song is played."
3,Where is the title song?,"I liked the movie and enjoyed the CD very much, but was disapointed when I didn't hear the title song on the CD anywhere.I'd have given it 4 stars if the TITLE SONG were on the recording.I'd love to know who sang it and if it is available on another CD somewhere."
4,Almost Perfect!,I bought this CD a few years ago and still to this day I love it. Every song is a great reminder of the movie. The only thing that keeps this CD from being perfect is the missing songs such as Ice Cream and Fantastic. Otherwise it's great and always makes me feel great. I love it so much I had to track down the group Feisty (now renamed The Western Investor)and download Fantastic. Again it's too bad it's not on the CD but you can't have everything.[..]
4,good for background or singing along,This CD introduced me to bands I'd never had the chance to enjoy. It has a good mix of artists and genres and even a bit of comedy. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoyed the movie or who supports female singers.
