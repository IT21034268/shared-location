3,Good movie - just enjoy it,"I mainly wanted to see this movie because I'm a Kelly Preston fan. I half expected to not like it because I'm not really a big baseball fan. But as I watched, I couldn't help but enjoy it. Does it have it's share of Hollywood cliches? Maybe. But if you don't over-analyze it, you'll find something in the movie that you can relate to in some way. Relax for a couple hours and enjoy."
4,A terrific romantic drama!,"Costner plays a pitcher that is facing a decision-whether or not to retire. His girlfriend (Preston) dumps him and his team, the Detroit Tigers, tells him to quit or be traded. A great movie, and you'll love the ending."
2,Almost a strikeout.........,"For the Love of the Game is about Detriot Tiger's pitcher Billy Chapel. He is in the twilight of his career. His team is in last place, the owner sold the team, his girlfriend is leaving, and he has to pitch against the hated Yankees.Billy has a difficult decision to make whether to play another year or retire. During the game he reminiscence about the good and bad experiences about his relationship with his girlfriend Heather.This movie was at times unbearable. The story was filled with romance cliches and the ending was predictable. Rent before you buy....."
3,"Okay, but I wouldn't watch it a second time","Kevin Costner pulls a poor performance it this feel good baseball story. The stroyline was filmsy, and hardly entertaining. The only thing that saved it was Sam Raimi's awesome directing."
2,Where's the baseball movie?,"I was ready to watch a baseball movie and a love story broke out! Kevin, puhleeze, one genre at a time. Costner at his self serving best in both sport and love. Seems this guy can't figure out a theme for this film. If you want lots of angst and little curve ball, this film is for you. If not, rent ""The Natural"" still the best fictional baseball movie ever made."
2,boring,"I love Kevin Costner. I hate this movie. I wish this movie was about baseball. Instead it is mainly an extremely boring love story. There is no chemistry between Costner and milk toast Travolta, whatever her name is. Their romance is dull. I didn't much care about what happened to anybody in this movie. The only compelling character was Costner's and everytime he got back around Ms. Boring, I didn't care what happened to him either. This movie is two hours that feel like ten. I was hoping all the characters would kill themselves."
5,As good as a movie gets!,The movie is great itself and it still remains my significant other's favorite. I received the shipment quicker than stated which is awesome and there was not a scratch on the movie. Works great!
3,Baseball movie,Would have been better if the swearing was eliminated. This is more of a story about a relationship than baseball.
5,Costner at his best.,Love this movie. Had it on vcr tape but wanted it on dvd. Kevin Costner is today's Gary Cooper. Excellent show.
3,"Great baseball, useless ending","The baseball is dramatic and realistic and the flashbacks are effective. The idea of the events of his whole life coming together to make for a dream performance against the odds is exciting. But his romance is so shallow and hollow, and to make it all come right at the end without any reason or sense just doesn't cut it."
2,Damaged Case,"I really like this movie and was excited to get it. However, when I received this in the mail the case was super cracked and damaged. Luckily, the DVD was fine. Unfortentely, I paid the money for a damaged product. I was disappointed in the shipping of this item. :("
3,Not a chick flick!,"Men will like this movie....women will find the faults in it.It does a great job of showing baseball and how relationships are handled during a winning season as well as through injuries but it lacks commitment. Which is exactly what the lead character lacks towards the female lead!If I wanted to watch a better baseball movie, I would get The Natural or Field of Dreams."
5,Its a HOMERUN,"This is definitely a movie for your home collection. It addresses both sexes, great sports for us guys and teary eyed moments for the lady in the house. A must see movie for all. Ranks up there with TIN CUP, FIELD OF DREAMS and DAYS OF THUNDER......"
1,Below Average,For the love of the game HD/DVD. We were unable to view this product on any of our three DVD players. This is after we followed the written instructions included in the package. Really feel like this was a gimic.
2,A Disappointment Overall,"For Love of the Game has its moments, but overall disappoints. The love story is cliched as hell, but some will enjoy it. The baseball scenes are good, but the players just didn't seem like major leaguers to me. Also, I found the announcers at the game (Vin Scully and someone else) kind of annoying. Their banter just didn't ring true.Costner's performance is marginal. One of the central plot elements is his character's balance of the two loves of his life--Preston's character and baseball. Baseball has always been the clear number one, but he finally realizes during his final game as a player that, hey, maybe he does have room for a woman. Convenient timing there, Kevin!If the movie was around 1:30 long it would have been a whole lot better. The simple plot just didn't support a two hour plus run time."
1,Don't Do It,"This bleak excuse for a movie should be banned, as should the bulk of Costner's recent ""work."" Bad writing, bad acting. To watch this film is to die a slow and agonizing (and boring) death. Buy or rent The Rookie instead."
3,When's Kevin going to make a good movie again?,"True, I'm not into baseball, but it's like he's the male version of Sandra Bullock, playing the same guy over and over. I didn't care about him and wimpy Jane, and in the end, he was just so glorified that it bugged me."
5,"""For Love of the Game"" HD DVD","Great movie, new condition, great price, shipped immediatly. For some reason I got a message that the vendor was out of the product. Asked to contact seller who responded within 12 hours. Great service. Unfortunatly my state of the art theatre set up wouldn't play HD. Reordered and I am very satisfied with that DVD. Very satisfied!"
5,Outstanding Baseball Film,I love baseball and was thrilled with this movie. It deals with the thought process of baseball and its emotional side. It is more than a stereotyped film. It brings out the child that loved to play baseball in all of us. I would highly recommend this film for the fan of baseball who loves a romantic film. Kevin Costner gives a stellar role here. One can tell he has a love for baseball. The acting is well done and the ending is moving.
5,The Mind of a Pitcher,"I love this film and have seen it several times. One of my favorite running themes is how the ""For the Love of the Game"" takes the viewer into the mind of a pitcher and helps the viewer understand the relationship between the catcher and the pitcher. I still remember that to this day as I watch my favorite team: the Boston Red Sox :)This is a nice baseball flick with a love theme weaved into it and a lot about the psyche of baseball and team spirit. I loved it and recommend it for baseball fans and non-baseball fans alike. There is enough substance for both. I enjoy Kevin Costner as an actor and this movie is one of my favorites.5 stars :)"
1,Got a bad deal on Amazon,"I purchased the cd ""For Love of the Game"" and it would not play iin any of my units so I purchased a new player and it still will not play. Kind of hard to review the movie that should be on the CD when it doesn't play.Sam Rice Hillsboro, TX"
1,Entertainment factor simply because it is so bad.,"That's right, this is one of the movies that is so bad it is watchable, because you can kind of marvel at the sheer cheesiness of if. Some of the dialogue is so bad it belies description. Don't get me wrong, I loved Bull Durham. But this. Adding to the perverseness of this story is that Costner's character is so damned unlikeable. People that give this 5 stars, or 4 are beyond my understanding. I just don't get it."
1,OK...,"Ok, when things are not going well, let's make a good old baseball movie to have good reviews and good cash coming in.. . This is the formula created by Costner, and it is working !"
1,Not Bull Durham or Field of Dreams,"If you're expecting to see another heart stirring Field of Dreams or hilarious Bull Durham performance out of Kevin Costner, then don't watch this film. The movie is less a baseball movie than a relationship movie, and not a very interesting one at that. Although the movie has a few interesting moments, such as a compelling scene where Costner ""gets in the zone"" to pitch and turns off the crowd noise around him, most of the movie was pure oversentimental drivel.As I recall, I fast forwarded through about the last 30 minutes of the DVD, hoping, praying that the film would somehow redeem itself with something interesting to watch. Save yourself the time on this stinker: it didn't improve..."
1,Sports movie at its worst,"How can someone even mention the brilliant 'Field of Dreams' together with this overlong, over-sentimental movie? This is the biggest waste of talent that I've encountered in quite a while - Sam Raimi, Basil Poledouris, those two are among the best in their professions. And what did they do? Well, let me put it this way: They took a popular sport, took every energy out of it (the Baseball-scenes are repeated endlessly, same style, again and again), added some of the worst dialogue ever and put a romance at the center of the story. That ain't so bad, but there's no chemistry between Costner and Wright-Penn. I could go on, but you get the point. At the end, you're happy it's over. No climax, just a needless 'happy end'. Sam Raimi used to be such a good director, and even in his lesser movies, he had his style. There's no style here. A flop, financially and critically, Sam Raimi move on... and give us a good 'Spiderman'."
3,The Ultimate Movie Review! [...],"On the surface, this movie is a cheesy romance flick, but what makes it unique is it's backdrop. An aging pitcher, at the end of his career, looks back on how it all started, while in the middle of pitching what could be his final game. Along with the flashbacks of his baseball memories, come flashbacks of his romance, which are long and lame. The baseball part of it is what attracted me and is great. If this was strictly a sports movie, it would be 5 stars. The story of his career is much stronger than several other films dedicated to just the game. With this film you have to take the good with the bad. At times it seems like two entirely different movies and it really takes away from what is otherwise a great film."
4,"Not Perfect, But Good","Believable, stylish, suspenseful, thought-provoking, vivid but uneven. The baseball scenes are superb. I can't think of any movie that has more authentic-looking and sounding baseball. My favorite scenes are the ones that include the incomparable Vin Scully, but the scene with Billy Chapel sobbing in his room is powerful. The romantic scenes are not nearly as good, but the movie still effectively explores some issues like the emptiness of self-indulgence and the struggle that an aging athlete has in knowing when to walk away. Finally, I love Vince Gill's song at the end. ""For Love Of The Game"" is rated PG-13 for a few sexually suggestive scenes and some strong language."
4,Kevin Costner Was Right,"Kevin Costner was right. He fought bitterly with Universal to release the original cut of the movie, but lost to bean counters that were afraid of an overlong movie. I just saw the DVD and the deleted scenes, that can finally be seen, make for a much more complicated and moving story. Particularly the subplot with his coach's wife's struggle with cancer and when his friend on the Yankees came in to congratulate him and say goodbye. Those were the scenes that made these characters real and took down the wall of ""just baseball"" and made it a satisfying drama. ""For Love of the Game"" is a fine film that will hopefully be seen from now on with these important scenes included."
5,Twisted claw,I loved this book so much! My goal is to read all of the Hardy Boys books!It was so good!
1,The Emperor has no clothes...,"Tracey Emin could be a character right out of Ayn Rand's ""The Fountainhead,"" one of Ellsworth Toohey's 'proteges,' a person of little or no real artistic talent foisted upon a gullible public as an ""art superstar,"" to quote one fashion magazine. I've seen her 'work'...pretentious rubbish that any idiot could do, if his or her pride was sufficiently low. What is gained by lowering the standards of art?"
5,"Build, maintain and repair your own wheels without fear","I have been using Mr. Brandt's book for 19 years now (since its first edition in 1981). It is invaluable. Concise, clearly written. It debunks myths and makes the seemingly complicated matter of the bicycle wheel easy to understand and not intimidating at all. Maintain, repair, rebuild or build new wheels. The results are perfect. Ride without fear. Have pride in what you have done and show it off to others."
4,"No idea how to rebuild your Bikes wheel, this book will help","Having taken apart my mountain bikes wheel thinking it would be easy to fix, clean, and put back together, I found it an impossible task. This book solved that problem almost instantly, two attempts and the wheel has been rebuilt and it's working perfectly. That said, if you only need like I did to build/repair a wheel, thats only one chapter. The amount of technical detail contained is way over the top, and probably unneccessary for most people, not to mention the pages at the back of pure numbers, which I readily admit to having no clue what they relate to."
5,"Wheels are complex, but this book makes simple.","Years ago, I disassembled my father's front wheel and rebuilt it, just to see if I could. Then I noticed that I'd made some mistakes, so I did it again. And again. Days later, when I gave up, it still wasn't right.I bought a copy of this book, and promptly built myself some wheels that I just retired at around 10 years old.Wheels are *complicated* structures. But this book makes it possible for the moderately competent tinkerer to learn to build the most beautiful, efficient, functional structure s/he'll ever put together. And that's pretty cool."
4,The wheel building bible,"Without a doubt, this is the accepted resource for wheel builders. I think the book is a well-written information source for the new and experienced builder. If you want to know how wheels work, this book is for you. The engineering explanations are useful and detailed. Some feel the author is a little old fashioned in his view point on new products and wheel design. That viewpoint is implied in a few places in the book, but I don't feel it is over emphasized."
1,NOT clearly written for average readers,"This is a terribly-written book. Sections of it are utterly incomprehensible for average readers who don't already understand the structural mechanics of a bicycle wheel. Although I agree with the author's preference for traditional wheel-building, I'd prefer it be written in simpler-to-understand language and include more practical concepts. For example: should I build a wheel with 32 or 36 spokes? He never makes this clear. How do I choose proper spoke lengths? He gives an equation on page 127 that seems impractical or unclear how to apply in actual use. (Am I really supposed to measure flange hole diameter and ""effective rim diameter"" and apply an equation using sine and cosine of the ""spoke angle"" when elsewhere he mentions, but never explains, a ""reference table"" of spoke lengths?)I'm an average reader who just wants to learn to build wheels. I don't believe this book prepared me to do this."
3,"Good guide for the basics, but lacking on the ""how to"" fine points.","This was the first book I read on wheel building and gained a good sense of the basics. The book can get very technical at points, but it misses some critical issues such as how to uniformly tension a wheel. Bottom line is that the book comes up short when it comes to actually building or repairing a wheel. A much better book is The ""Professional Guide to Wheel Building"" written by Roger Musson. It available as a download and it is outstanding. Munsson even includes how to make your own tools from a truing stand, to a nipple driver. I already had a Park truing stand, but made the nipple driver and saved close to $50."
4,Want to build wheels? You need this book.,"I am a mountain biker who got tired of taking my bike to the bike shop every time I broke a spoke. But, I live in a rural area and it is hard to find a mentor to teach me the skills needed. I first bought ""The Art of Wheel Building."" I liked the spiral binding and thought it would work well in my shop. But, after reading it I felt that my education was incomplete. I bought this book and read it in an afternoon. I found the engineering data not only interesting but also, important to understanding wheel maintenance and design. I'm glad I have both books and niether takes very long to read and understand."
4,"Good book, most recent edition still slightly dated.","Great book on wheel theory, breaks down complex topics to be understandable by most savvy mechanics. One thing I don't like is that it's a bit dated, to 8 speed clusters/casettes, and while Brandt is somewhat infamous for taking a ""if it aint broke don't fix it"" approach, some of the advances in the last few years SHOULD be considered, especially in hub flange design (new Dura Ace/Ultegra straight pull hubs that still allow tangential spoking come to mind) Would also like to see some info about the R-Sys style ""wagon wheels"" and how that might factor into wheel building. Jobst also barely touches on modern materials like carbon fiber rims, different alloys like scandium, etc. GREAT book for 10 years ago, basically."
5,Bath accessory,Looks great. Elegant. Gives the vanity an elegent look.Goes with any decor. The clear finish will complement any color. Very please with this.
4,Perfect for a small bathroom,"My bathroom is rather small, so I had to find compact accessories - this is perfect for me.It also seems durable and looks nice."
4,Cotton Ball Holder,"Nice product except that lid is a bit difficult to grasp. Other than that, works well (even though we only use it - both cavities - for qtips)."
1,NOT what was ordered !!,"ended up receiving a ""TUNA""-flavored type of this product...and the ONLY reason I added it to my cart was BECAUSE this 'flavor' is not available locally. there was not even a note to explain that ""Minnow"" was unavailable and they did a substitution !!"
2,no no no...only a go for Grieco fans,"This movie has a really abstruse storyline, and not in a positive way. You might like to see Mr. Grieco walking around half naked but that is basically it. Even the female blonde in that movie does not seem to be a good choice. It's all a bit awkward."
2,Richard is on the prowl.,"If you are an ""I can't get enough of this guys bod!"" fan like myself, then this is a must see. He is VERY sexy in this role & it's a thourghly watchable plot (it's been a while sence i saw it but it has something to do with him being geniticly crossed with tomcat genes, he's a catburgler *Ha-Ha* by trade & looking to get down with a female , as tomcats do). But...if you are just wanting to see it for the movie itself, don't bother."
1,Very disappointed...,I got a used copy of this book and was glad I hadn't paid full price. It bothers be when the characters start reciting History lessons as a way of explaining the story.I felt like I was reading a techinical manual and not enjoying the book.One of the few books I didn't even finish.
2,incredible price but,"Easy to order,quick delivery, and incredibly cheap price ($.48) plus shipping but it did not improve the signal (it actually made it worse) to my tv so I resorted to using my old RCA only cable from my VCR to TV. Oh well it may be useful for something else in the future."
5,This really works,I think this really saved me hundreds of dollars. I can see someone charging a lot of money to converting the RCA plug to S vidoe.It works wonderfully and I can use my projector screen
1,Didn't work at all,"This didn't work for me at all. Sometimes it will depend on your particular setup, so your mileage may vary. I figured for the price I may as well try it. My TV and computer just laughed at me. I don't doubt it works fine for some people - there's just so much variation between setups!"
4,Good product,This was exactly what I was looking for and the price was right. Had bought one from a brick and mortar for the cost that I got 5 for here.
1,Terrible adapter,"I wanted an adapter to convert a standard RCA jack (yellow) into an S-Video input. This will do that, but the picture quality is terrible. I don't know if any device upconverts the picture quality from RCA to S-Video, but this did not give me a good result."
5,Simplified my stereo system,My receiver outputs RCA sources as RCA and S-VHS sources as S-VHS. (no cross converting) So I was constantly switching the TV source back and forth between S-VHS and RCA depending on whether I was watching cable or watching a movie. This little adapter simplified it so that all my components are S-VHS now. So the TV stays on S-VHS.
1,Picture quality unacceptable,"Unfortunately, I have two of these. Since both of them result in the same poor picture quality, it doesn't appear that it is a fluke of getting one which is defective.The picture is ""watchable"", but it is obvious there is degradation of the quality. Originally, I bought it so I could connect an old VCR (which had RCA or coax output only) to a flat-screen TV (Sharp Aquos). I wanted to use the inputs in the back which means I couldn't use a RCA video connector since the RCA video input on the Sharp is on the side of the TV. I thought I'd just use the RCA to S-Video adapter... but the picture came out so bad, I couldn't believe it. I thought it might be the output from the VCR but when I plugged the RCA video connector directly into the RCA video input on the side of the TV, the picture looked fine.Perhaps using it as an S-video to RCA works better... Perhaps I'll give it a try, although I really have no use for such an adapter."
1,2Wire modems are junk,"I am now on my second 2Wire modem and, inevitably it seems, they give out within one year. Keep losing signal, wireless or hard-wired! Will never buy 2Wire again!!"
2,Forget it!,"This modem is by now maybe 3-4 years old. I got mine from a deceased uncle and replaced a Speedstream DSL router from AT&T; (at the time SBC). If I had to choose between AT&T; modems, I would consider this one far more dependable, though a bit slower, than the current AT&T; 2-Wire 2701HG-B. Plus the wireless is useless.Even so, my advice is don't buy either of them.You don't need an AT&T; DSL router to connect to AT&T.; Consider an Actiontec GT724WGR instead. It is a far superior modem and much more reliable. In fact, there is no comparison. Don't waste your money on this 2-Wire modem."
3,"Good as modem, not for Wi-Fi","It's a decent modem, but don't buy it for Wi-Fi use. I had the Wi-Fi power up to the max, and my laptop only picked up the signal when it was less than 2 feet from the device. I used this with a Linksys wireless router for a little while to get wireless internet. After a power surge, I couldn't get the 2Wire to work with the Linksys anymore. I just used the 2Wire and went without wireless internet until I broke down and bought another modem (Actiontec maybe) that works well with the Linksys router."
3,Inconsistent reliability,I've had this 2Wire 1000HG for AT&T DSL for 5 years until it died. To be fair Im giving it 3 stars for surviving 5 years. It had an annoying buzzing sound a week earlier before breaking down. I encountered a lot of problems including the Wifi losing signal at least once or twice a month in all my wireless devices and Im unable to connect. So I had to pull the plug of the unit to reset it because it had no power switch. The problem still persisted from time to time. I thought changing my cordless phones to a Dect 6.0 would help but I still experienced the same issue. On occasion the modem would turn orange for days and Im unable to connect to the internet at all. So when it broke I had the option to buy the latest model from 2Wire or Actiontec.(the latest model 2wire supplied by AT&T appears to have horrible reviews too) so I would recommend getting an Actiontec.
1,Eddie Izzard dvd,"It does not work,it will not load in dvd player, it just reopens. I tried it in other dvd players.I did not want to pay to return it. It would cost me more than I paid for it!"
4,"Not bad, though a little aggressively ""multi-cultural"".","So, this girl living in an apartment complex (which may or may not have greenery around it - she goes down to the ""shadow"" to hang out, which is shown as being mostly concrete, but we're also told about the buds swelling on the trees in spring) strikes up a friendship with an older Japanese neighbor over her origami, which she eventually learns to do eventually.It's a simple enough story, though I would've liked it to have been fleshed out a little more - all we know about Janessa is that she practices her origami a lot, and all we really know about her neighbor is that she came from Japan and is arthritic."
1,Not for the faint hearted.,This book is very difficult to read. The sentences are so long that you will struggle to make sense of them. The author goes out of his way to use long complicated words. This is not a good book to read to introduce yourself to the subject.
5,"Awesome, Awesome, Awesome","I happened to stumble upon this band by clicking on their homepage. I liked the name of the band. This duet will not disappoint you. Some people might want to classify Bachelor Girl with Natalie Imbruglia, but they're not even close. They have a more distinct style. It's rock and punk and pop together.I'm just waiting for the day when the radio stations in my area start playing them. Buses & Trains is great. =)"
2,Don't waste your time,"Far better is David Ray Griffin's ""9/11 Contradictions."" This book doesn't dig deep enough, and ends up obfuscating the issue.He is very correct though, in focusing on accountability. For the greatest intelligence failure in American history, (if that's what it was) not a single person was fired or demoted, yet we are asked to believe it was just a series of screw-ups that made it happen.Of course not. It was intentional, so we could do Israel's bidding in the middle east.Over 1,000 pilots, police, 9/11 survivors, engineers, architects, intelligence officers and high level govt officials are calling for a new investigation. Google ""Patriots question 9/11.""If you have children or grand-children and care about their future, find out the truth. Our future does not look good."
5,Great compilation for a band at the top of its game,"The commemorative DVD of Yellowjackets 25 is a marvelous compilation of songs recorded on their European tour. The production respects the musicians, something lacking in many DVDs created from live shows. The sound quality is impeccable, and provides a sense of ""being there"" that transports you into the venues.A tremendous effort."
4,(RAW Rating: 4.5) -- Eye Opening,"Davheed devoids himself of the bitterness and anger that so often travels with children exposed to the foster care system, and channels that energy into something positive. He shares his amazing walk through life during and after his tenure in the system. This is not a story, it is a journey of courage.With poetry and prose he delivers an emotional look at the pain and alienation of foster children, and their efforts to survive in a society that ignores them and often rejects their existence. This is a poignant account of abuse, rejection, racism and atonement. And of Davheed's identification with Judasim which has been his life-line.THROUGH THE EYES OF A FOSTER CHILD is blatantly honest, heart-felt and compassionate. This should prove to be a useful tool to all persons involved with childcare or childcare programs. This is an empathetic book that will open your eyes.Reviewed by aNNof The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"
4,The Sound of the 80's,"If you like 80's music you'll like this one. The band has become more known in the U.S. now than in the 80's. Some of the songs you'll recognize from contemporary radio like ""I Got You"". The music is great. If you are overly serious you might beware. Songs like ""Shark Attack"" may sound silly. Overall the whole album is strong. If you want fun and a bit strange this album is near brilliant."
3,no drumstick,"cute little book and alot of fun with my daycare but thought it was odd it said use a pen or pencil for a drumstick inside the book, doesn't seem like that would be a good idea for kids??"
5,Golf for girls,These have been great in teaching young girls to play golf. Whatever it takes to keep there interest in the game. Very easy to clean and reuse.
4,Works on HD radio!!,I got this product for my HD radio and it works great. I recommend this product to anyone looking for better and more consistent reception with there HD radio.
1,Don't use for HD radio,Bought based upon another review that claimed the antenna worked well with HD radio. Antenna did nothing to help my Sony HD radio. It performed worse than the antenna system that came with the radio.
1,Zip Zero Nada,"For digital radio, no improvement over the long dipole fm aerial I received with my radio. Which was very disappointing."
1,"Not so good, necessary cable missing","This product doesn't really work well. What's worse, it requires a coaxial cable to work with any modern television. So saying that it ""supports HDMI"" or HI Def or whatever... that's a bit misleading. It's pretty much useless to me."
2,Can't tune in UHF and VHF at the same time on newer TVs,"I bought this antenna to use with a set-top box in order to receive over-the-air Digital TV. The antenna is advertised as being able to receive VHF (bunny ear dipoles) and UHF (wire loop) signals, but the antenna doesn't come with a 'band combiner'. The manual explains that if your TV or receiver only has a single 'ANT IN' connection (and not separate UHF/VHF inputs, as you may remember seeing on some ancient TVs), then you either have to buy a band combiner (at least $7 incl shipping--search Amazon for 'splitter combiner') or manually switch the screw connections when you change channels.Most DTV channels are on UHF, but standard TV is still largely on VHF in my area, so I returned this item to Amazon. I also didn't find that the UHF reception was any better than the single piece of wire I was using before (and will use until I buy a powered antenna)."
3,Decent info,"The information is informative but could be taken with a grain of salt. Also, the book seems to not be absolutely current. I went to a website the book mentioned just to find out it no longer exists."
3,Informative,"Informative simply written and easy to understand for the beginner. Has tips, forms and checklists."
1,Editing Problems,"This book is very informative, but some of the information boxes are missing the wording. It cuts off some of the words, so the information is incomplete and makes it hard to follow what is going on.I want to know who to contact in order to get a better edited copy of this book. I have almost completed reading it, but I would have liked to have received a correctly edited copy of the book that I paid for.Thank you for listening.Chereese Jowers"
1,BEWARE: Wrong product pictured...,"What you see when you're buying is the picture of a spacious bag, what they send to you is a ridiculously small one, that barely holds a small MiniDV camera.I'm only giving it a ""1"" because, even though this bag just can't hold an extra battery AND an extra tape at the same time, it's well constructed after all...I'm trully very disappointed with this trickery!"
2,Let us not make of it more than it is............,"Let's not aggrandize this film; there is not a lot of substance going on here. A sad and youthful death, yes (why do all the pretty ones have to go first?)----and grieving and loss. But there's little to create an emotional attachment to these characters......even prior to the death.This production is NOT a ""Steam: The Turkish Bath"" in that regard, or even an ""His Secret Life,"" both of which got us more ""involved."" To this viewer, the most interesting point was before film's end, in the denoument between widower, Davide, and a come-to-acceptance and grieving, deceased's father.At film's conclusion, there is a tying-up........a coming to terms. I wonder, though, is real life ever as smooth as pictured?PS--Points for beautiful, beautiful photography work (are this man's films ever not?)****"
2,Sub-Titles,The reason I gave this movie only 2 stars is that I hate sub-titles. I prefer to have movies translated in English.
5,fantastic,could not wait to get the book and it was just as wonderful as Peter J Murray said it would be love this book
3,Quick Reference is not so quick,"The book is thorough in its coverage of the main Tablet PC applications. But that's not what I thought a Quick Reference should be. At 264 pages, this book is a bit long-winded.Great section on how the handwriting recognition works though.Being the first Tablet PC book to hit the market, it does the platform justice."
2,"3 sips, not 3 cups. So tiny I laughed.","I have no idea why this product is marketed as a 3 cup. After adding the ground coffee you'll barely get enough water in it to make a standard mug/cup. I don't know about you but a cup of coffee for me is actually a Cup in measure. The quality is good but the rubber base should be removed before microwave heating or it gets too hot (nearly melted).Hugo says this thing is ""Unbreakable"" but I don't want to test it out since it feels like tempered glass. Yes I know what Polycarbonate or Lexan feel like."
3,Not Three Cups,"Maybe three demitasse cups.This is a standard one-cup French Press, providing about 10 oz of brew.It is an adequate French Press - how can you screw that up?(Conversely, what can you do to make one special?)My beef is that this is advertised as 3 cups which I take to mean 24 oz raw capacity.I should have known something was up when the fluid ounce capacity was not specified.The price was good, even at the reduced capacity, thus the 3rd star."
5,Even works GREAT with tea,"I use my Bonjour press to press my loose Earl Grey tea leaves. It does a fantastic job and the measuring scoop you get with this thing is the perfect size for scooping tea. Get this... it even works great for pressing tea bags to get that extra kick of tea. I don't drink coffee (sorry if that is blasphemy), but I am sure it would do just fine with coffee. This press is NOT a standard U.S. 3 cups. You will do good to get 10-12 oz. out of it. Some may complain about that, but even though it is a little misleading, it is perfect for my 15 oz. mug."
2,Too Small,"I have no idea where they came up with 3 cups on this because it will only take about 8 oz. of water. They must mean demi-tasse cups. It is really too small to use if you are making more than just one small cup of coffee. I love the idea of a ""French Press"" coffee maker but after you bring your water to a boil, pour it over the grounds, let it set for about 5 minutes, then press it out, I would like to have more to show for my time and effort."
2,Small like a toy,It is definitely not for 3 cups. It is a mini French Press for 1 cup of coffee. I was shocked to see the size. Other than that it works.
3,3-cup French Press,"I like this French Press. It is said to be 3-cup, however that is not American cups, you will get one mug of drink from it. Also the rubber bottom is too loose and easily falls off. Other than that it is reasonably priced and does the job."
4,Cheap & Very Tiny,"At less than $10, it's hard to have many complaints about this French Press. It's cheap and easy to use, and like most presses makes superior coffee.The one thing that you should be aware of before you purchase it, is that it is EXTREMELY TINY, and has somewhat of an odd design. There is absolutely no way that this press contains three cups of coffee, it is more like one small cup. You should also be aware that the plastic piece on the bottom that keeps the press balanced is also removable. Therefore, it is easy to spill if you are not careful.If you are looking for something small and cheap to leave at the office than this is not a bad choice, but if you're looking purchase a French Press for more frequent home use, I would definitely invest a few extra dollars and go with a larger and more substantial classic glass version from Bodum."
3,Good coffee but SO SMALL!,Great coffee but I wish I would have read more reviews first. I LOVE coffee and this is not 3 cups worth. Even if I filled to the brim it is about 12 ounces. Since you're not supposed to fill it that full it is approx. 8.5-9.5oz. I want more!! I would have bought a bigger one had I known that someone doesn't know how to measure in ounces. Oh well.
4,Love it!,cute and just love it. a little bit pricey for what I expect but I like it. 4 stars for that.
2,Not satisfied,"This item is very, very small. not what I expected. Looks like a dollar store item, not $11. Not happy."
5,looks nice together with my make up organizer!,"bought this with [Acrylic Cosmetic Organizer With 9 Compartment] together, so in match! I put my cotton round in the small side, it fits perfectly."
3,Smaller Than Anticipated,"I was looking for a break resistant container for cottom balls and Qtips. I ordered this item and was pleased with its construction but surprised by its size. It's difficult to tell by the illustration. The larger side is 4 1/2 "" high and 3"" across. Yes, I'll keep it and use it but it's smaller than it looks."
5,"compact, clean and simple","i've been looking for a nice-looking, clean and simple dispenser for cotton balls and q-tips for a narrow medicine cabinet shelf. this looked good, and being one unit, it seemed to be a good size and very serviceable. it's plastic so easy to clean. perfect for my needs."
4,smaller than expected but still love it,"I thought this was going to be bigger, but its still something Im glad I purchased. Fits the qtips perfectly."
5,Very clever,This product is great for those who use cotton balls and Q-tips regularly. I gave it as a gift and the recipients loved it.
4,very nice,"This is just perfect for my salon to keep my cotton items organized and clean. Looks real nice too, almost like glass."
2,Disappointed,the size is way smaller than it looks in the picdoes not look as good as it does in the pic toodoes not worth the moneydisappointed
1,Not made in America,The product appears nice however the discription says it's made in America when in fact it's made in Taiwan. The 'made in America' label is important to me and influenced my decision to buy this product.
3,Not for an advanced student.,"I have studied Russian for three years, but unfortunately, because I am graduating, I will be unable to take the advanced course that my college offers. For the past couple of months, I've been trying to find a good package so that I can learn Russian on my own. Out of all the ones I have explored, Pimsleur looked to be the most promising. While it did help me in that I am able to speak more clearly, I don't see it as being a replacement for an advanced Russian course. For one thing, the vocabulary is extremely limited. It will help you have casual conversations, but don't expect to be having any deep discussions about complex subjects. Two, because the reading supplement is so limited, many problems will arise when you have to write. Three, and most importantly, I feel that the speakers speak too slowly, at least compared to the people in the listening supplement of my textbook."
3,Expensive and limited,"The reader from Tel Aviv got it exactly right. This course is good, but it is extremely expensive and offers only a limited amount of vocabulary and grammatical structures. The result is that you will be able to say a certain amount of things clearly and with good pronounciation, but you will be broke and will have trouble understanding (let alone expressing) even moderately complex thoughts."
1,Really bad,"This IS a bad book. As pointed out in the other review, mechanicaly it is a mess: The main text has been printed in four different type fonts. The pagination usually occurs centered at the bottom of the page, but it also appears at either side--for no apparent good reason. As for the content. . . well, consider: the discription that accompanies the illustration on page 346 is pure nonsense--what are the authors trying to say? It's gibberish. On page 124 they lapse into an involved illustration of how much 1 inch of rain will accumulate on a square mile. None of the figures they arrive at coincide (broken calculator perhaps or just sloppy work?).I also must point out that the one positive review for this book, the one from Swampscott Mass., just happens to be from the same small town in which one of the authors resides. Coincidence? I doubt it."
5,Really good weather book!!!,"I have been looking for a long time for a good and thorough book that explains all about weather and does so in a way that is easy to read for someone who is not a scientist. I am just a weather enthusiast and want to learn more about this fascinating topic. I completely enjoyed reading this book, ""WEATHER BASICS"" by Balsama and Chaston. It made the science of weather ""come alive"". Great chapters on hurricanes, tornadoes, thundertorms, winter weather, etc. etc. Excellent pictures with the chapters as well. I learned a lot. I definitely recommend this book to anyone who enjoys weather and wants to learn more, plus have an excellent reference book on all the various weather topics."
5,Best introductory weather book I've gotten,"Being a weather enthusiast, I own most of the books on weather, and for years had been looking for a comprehensive book on introductory meteorology that explained even the difficult concepts in an undetstandable format. I was terrifically pleasantly surprised when I read ""WEATHER BASICS"" by Balsama and Chaston. This is a very large book and covers ever aspect of weather, including advanced concepts of which I was unaware. I give this book the highest rating and readily endorse and recommend it to anyone who loves weather."
3,"Non-stop, action packed... relatively not enjoyable.","To get this out of the way, I'll first admit my disability to put the book down. It is just over 200 pages and it is brilliantly paced. This, primarily, is the reason I grant the short story a three star rating. Many revenge tales give you something to like about the anti-hero. With Rogan, I found no redeeming quality to grasp on to. Revenge, in this novel, was anything but bitter-sweet. It was painful, merciless, and pitiful. I hopelessly grasped for healing, but it was seldom found.Chapter 12, however, stood magnificently above the rest. This alone was worth reading the rest of the shallow plot.If you can find it for cheap, pick it up, blast through, then collect your thoughts about it. Perhaps you'll find more meaningful bits behind the plot than I did."
3,Cool Find - Quick & Entertaining,"Clearly Puzo's service in the Second World War deeply influenced a great deal of his work including this pre-Godfather effort. This is a tidy little tale that I picked up in a La Guardia Borders and finished before I touched down in Montreal (it is just over 200 pages). It moves with speed and is rife with interesting characters, however, the plot is a touch too fantastic yet highly entertaining. Anything with a revenge plot against evil Nazis cannot be too bad. I also think it may have influenced Robert Littell's The Amateur as there are similarities."
3,Not the best...but ok read.,"Thought this book would be a bit more intense as far as background and dialogue, but it was good...certainly not outstanding like The Godfather, but if you are into reading about a man meting out justice and revenge, then this book is for you. Very disappointed with ending, though."
2,cheap,being that it was only 3 bucks total.. i guess its not that bad... but the button to press so that we can get the charger/connector from the palm would not work.... so the clip on the sides broke..
5,Served its purpose,"Perfect product, really served its purpose well for a nice low price. Read some of the initial reviews, decided to take my chances and it paid off nicely. Was able to pull my data off my old palm and install the data on my new device. Works well, highly recommended, can't beat the price!"
1,Ruined my Palm Tungsten,I ordert his as a replacement for my lost data cable. It is impossible to remove it and it is also impossible to transfer the data to my computer because it doesn't have the button one needs to touch to start the transfer. Has rendered my expensive device useless.DO NOT BUY IT FOR YOUR TUNGSTEN 2E
1,This didn't transfer data to my laptop,I bought this hoping it would transfer my calendar to my laptop. But it did not work. Very disappointing. It was cheap so not worth returning but don't expect it to work.It's back to the drawing board for me.
1,do not purchase,I plugged my Palm in with this cord and I could not get it out. Almost broke my Palm trying.
1,no,"It was unnecessary to buy this product, since the Tungsten E2 (which also turned out to be useless to me) comes equipped with one."
1,Does not disconnect easily,I have a Tungsten E2 and it does not want to disconnect easily like the original one I had. The original has a short in the cord.
1,"only works as a charger, does not hot sync Tungsten E2","This cable is not for the Tungsten E2, it is for a Treo 600. It has no hot sync button and will not hot sync through software despite what they assert. Don't get it."
2,Part 2,I was excited about getting this book since I truly enjoyed the first. Got it. SADLY disappointed! Same illustrations...same explanations...same EVERYTHING except section on Bridge!!! WORTHLESS if you have the first...valuable if you don't. Wish I had saved my money!
2,Average,"Although I just about 1/3 thru of this book, my opinion is this book just average in step by step instructions. This book might show you the results, but it lacks the ""easy to follow"" details of approach."
5,Holy Crap.,"This kit includes(so you don't have to strain your eyes):A Multi speed bullet vibe with a rabbit sleeve(2AA),a Water-proof vibrator with a penis-shaped sleeve(2C),An Engagement ring-shaped cock ring,Anal Beads(roped kind with knots),Duo tone balls,Glow ""love"" dice(better known as dirty dice),Couples coupon booklet,A feather Tickler,and a Satin Blind fold.This kit also includes some lubes.I LOVE this kit. The bullet and the vibe are very high quality and very powerful. The sleeves with them make them even better. The cock ring is just plain cute, and the couples coupons are pretty funny. This is a great honey moon or romantic weekend kit for a very good price. They quickly moved to the top of my 'favourite toy' list."
5,Beautiful Dishes,"I love these dishes! They are not only pretty, but useful for every day. The large bowl is great as a serving bowl for just about anything and the smaller bowls are perfect for individual soup, salad or pasta servings. They are also useful as vegetable serving bowls. I am so glad that I ordered this set. I ordered the 18 piece dinnerware set first, so these 2 sets go perfectly together. Both are great buys!The only thing that disappointed me was that one of the small bowls came broken and that Amazon did not offer to replace the bowl. I did get money credited to my account, but now I am still short one bowl from the set."
5,Used these for years!~......,Used these for years!~......Great pattern nice quality this part of the set is a bargain price....at 60% off!~ Very nice dishes!~
5,Very pleased,Arrived within the time expected;was packed well;good quality;pretty design. We are very pleased with the individual bowls and the serving bowl.
4,A great book for getting started,"Excellent book. The author gives tons of useful techniques and methods and materials suggestions. He clearly knows what he's doing. The reason I only gave four stars is: there are sometimes alternate techniques, now available that are not mentioned. For example Rustall, or Modern Options ""Instant Iron"" and ""Instant Rust."" can be IMHO better ways to create the rust effects. But even so, the book is a must. It practically guarantees success if you pay attention."
1,Um?,"The immediate set-up of this book has a lot of promise. However, when the book itself degenerates into a massively mulitiplayer dialogue, it felt like a fictional account of an election or natural disaster without the luxury of having it play out on TV. I almost get the feeling this was written as a script and repackaged as a short novel. I was less than impressed."
2,Should've been a short story,"The Coming takes place later this century in a world wracked by social change. A scientist in Gainesville detects an approaching spaceship, and the news causes some upheaval, though not as much as might be expected. Nothing new, it would seem, but Haldeman keeps the focus almost entirely within Gainesville: very little of the action takes place outside the university town. The novel feels stretched out: it probably would have made a fine short story, but as a novel it left me thinking, ""This is it? This is all we get?"" Without giving away the ending, it's not a particularly satisfying one. Haldeman doesn't really explain the why of the plot. In fact, the plot feels like just so much baggage while he expounds on a few social themes, like the criminalization of homosexuality and the implications of real traffic control. In the end, Haldeman has many interesting ideas (as always) but it was stretched out far too long. He's a fine author with lots to say - just not here."
2,"Great narrative style, great vision, let down ending","Joe Haldeman is one of the few authors whose books I will buy in hardback without a second thought. ""The Forever War"" remains one of my top 2 or 3 favorite books of all time, in all genres.This book shows him growing still as a writer, not afraid to experiment with style.The story flows from one character to the next in a seamless way: the section transitions are usually continuous with the focus and the action merely shifting to another character in the scene. This is extremely well done, and holds your interest well. It also advances the plot nicely.His vision of life in the near (~50 years hence) future is well realized. It is easy to believe that people will live just like this.Sadly, the ending seems to be just tacked on. It is a letdown. For a book focused on the ""Coming"" of aliens, I expected a bigger bang, but got only a fizzle.Summary: read if you're a Haldeman fan, but wait for the paperback."
5,Superb!,"Once again Haldeman proves that science and fiction can be weaved seamlessly into a single fabric. Few writers have this gift - to write a piece of ""future fiction"" that does not seem forced or contrived. ""The Coming"" is a excellent mix of mystery, science, and a good helping of social satire. It is both interesting and enjoyable to read. I highly reccomend it!"
2,A Letdown for Haldeman Fans,"I've loved a number of Haldeman's books and recommended to them both to friends and strangers, so I am sad to say that The Coming just didn't work for me. While there is some nice detail about the near future world, the novel is very local-centric about events and promises a bigger and better payoff than it ultimately delivers. The passing of point-of-view from character to character as they meet and interact is an interesting experiment, but feels artificial at times and, since some of the characters are quite peripheral to the plotline, provides detail about characters that you don't really need to know and don't really care about. Pacing is slow at the beginning, but picks up quite handily near the end, leading to an abrupt and disappointing conclusion. I would suggest you re-read one of Haldeman's classics instead of The Coming. Donald J. Bingle, Author of Forced Conversion."
2,"Years before she was inflicted upon us, Haldeman predicted Sarah Palin!","At least the pinheaded president of ""The Coming"" seemed to greatly resemble her. It's possibly the most (accidentally) intriguing aspect of this novel.Haldeman is a brilliant writer - I've read The Forever War and the Worlds Trilogy so many times, the books fell apart in my hands. This one isn't in the same league. For one thing, we almost - but don't quite - bond with the characters, in part because too many points of view are offered. The female protagonist's relationship with her husband is left unexplored, though as depicted it elicit too many nagging questions to be left alone. The response of the citizens of earth to the possible approach of an alien craft are quite hollow.Haldeman at his best draw us in with vibrant, lovable characters (like Marianne O'Hara from Worlds and Mandella from The Forever War. He could have done that here with a longer, more detailed book, but it didn't quite happen."
2,DISAPPOINTED!,"Very disappointed. This was supposed to be about aliens coming to visit the Earth. This was supposed to be Science Fiction. This was very boring. This novel is very little about science fiction, (ok it is set in the future), but more about how the city of Miami and apparently the whole world has become utterly depraved and run by minor mafia hit men. The big surprise ending doesn't land with a bang but fizzles before it gets there. Very disappointed."
1,Why?,"I don't think there is much disagreement that this book is a Turkey. (Other than a sprinkling of gushing praise, probably from the publisher). The more interesting question is ""Why?"". Other reviewers have advanced various theories. My guess would be either that it was done on a bet or as a joke for us, the great unwashed herd of SF-consumers. In any case, the characters, plot (such as it is), sub-plots, themes, build-up, ending and ""science"" are a collection of random accidents that go absolutely nowhere. Maybe that's the point? There is a coded message in it somewhere? Or maybe it's the beginning of an entirely new genre and someday will be hailed as an all-time classic: ""Plan Haldeman From Outer Space!"""
2,"I like Haldeman, but not this book","Joe Haldeman is one of my favorites, but this book just never came together. As one reviewer said, it's a short story plot stretched to a novel. The stretching gives the reader all too much time to figure out the ending too early (I guessed it about fifty pages before the end). The characterization is decent, but somehow I just never got motivated to care about the characters that much. It's like they were just going through the motions.If you've read his early stuff and liked it, I recommend ""Buying Time"" or any of his short story collections over this. (I think ""Dealing in Futures"" is the best title for a short story collection ever, and the stories are pretty good too.) Or stick with the Forever X series - Forever Peace is a lot better than this book, and Forever Free is a decent sequel to Forever War."
1,"Awful novel, avoid!","Too many characters, the author should have focused on the scientist instead of trying to create so many useless characters. A real disappointment."
4,"Joe Haldeman's ""The Coming""...","If you're a fan of Joe Haldeman and his style of science fiction, I think you will enjoy ""The Coming"".I am primarily a fan of ""Military"" Sci-Fi, and this novel is definitely not that, but all in all, Idid enjoy it very much. It is very well written, with enough plot twists and turns to keep you readingpage after page."
3,"Interesting, but short, simple, and distorted","This read like a short story stretched into a small novel. The plot was exceedingly simple. While there is nothing wrong with portraying characters in all of their faults, the author seems to have a fairly distorted view of the depth of unusual sexuality and drug use."
2,Does Not Live Up To It's Billing!,"I finished this book tonight, finally. I would have quit days ago, but I hate to leave a book unfinished. The promotional reviews on the book's jacket led me, new to Joe Haldeman's books, to believe that this book ranked alongside Sagan's ""Contact,"" or Tilley's ""Fade Out,"" but it proved most disappointing. The book spends most of its time describing characters, and while I liked Rory, the Astronomer, her husband was a shallow, sexually-frustrated muscician, who yearned for his gay lover...but what is this kind of thing doing in a ""First Contact"" Sci-Fi novel? Another character, a Mafia-type baddie gained prominence early in the book, then died a fiery death, with little apparent relevance to the ""First Contact"" theme, and the book simply moves on to other characters. If you're looking for entertaining science fiction, you won't find it here, no matter what the jacket says. Let the Buyer Beware!"
3,Strong novel let down by rushed conclusion,"First off, the writing in this novel is superb. Haldeman changes the point of view among a dozen characters without ever skipping a beat. Furthermore, he does so without shorting the development of any one character; they are all well drawn, in part because we see them through the eyes of so many other people.That said, this novel gets off to a great start, and really does well until the last twenty pages or so. At that point, much like Haldeman's ""Forever Free"", it begins to feel rushed. The book ends on a note that is more confusing than anything else. You really lose the feel for the character's motivations, and there is a lot of activity that is barely explained.All in all, this is an enjoyable, well written novel, that is somewhat let down by its ending."
1,Where's the SF part?,"I found this book to be more of a cheap mystery novel than the SF book I was expecting. The characters were uninteresting. The plot had potential, but Haldeman never delivers. The ending left me very disappointed. Not worth the time it took to read."
2,A quick easy and very very light read.,"It is difficult to believe that the author of this novel won the Hugo and Nebula Awards and that he won them twice. ""The Coming"" isn't much of a novel. If you are really into science fiction this novel is not for you. It is futuristic to some degree but is very light on aliens and space travel and such. In fact, it is pretty light on story as well. ""The Coming"" is really more about politics, government and relations between people and set in the not so distant future. But it is a quick light easy read, good filler and better than watching TV."
3,Luckily a short book,"The year is 2054. Aurora Bell, an astronomy professor inFlorida, receives a message from outside the solar system that says""We're coming"". The source of the message is heading towardsearth and expected in three months time. During this 3 month period,the story takes you through the social fabric of the times. Designerdrugs are prevalent. There are exotic sexual devices. A war is aboutto break out overseas in Europe.Characters also take on a life oftheir own, though sometimes shallow. Such as Norman Bell and hisillicit sexual history and the extortionist by the name of Willie JoeCapra.I did like the smooth transitions from chapter too chapterand some of the characters, but I thought the ending was rather dull."
5,dictionary,I can just sit and read this dictionary for enjoyment because the pictures on the edges of the pages make all the words so interesting. My 16 year old daughter requested this particular dictionary for Christmas both of us are very pleased with it.
2,I'm sure the most recent hardcover is much much better.,"In retrospect, I should have gotten the most recent edition of this dictionary in hardcover instead of the paperback because it isn't complete enough. It is probable that I will do so at a later date. I recommend that anyone considering purchasing either who can afford the hardcover spend on it instead of on this, because I think this one may well be sure to disappoint."
2,More American than English,"The key word in the title ""American Heritage Dictionary"" is American. This is a parochial and biased dictionary aimed at the American audience, and cannot be considered a definitve dictionary of the English language. For example, it calls ""colour"" a variant of ""color"" - when in fact the American spelling is the variant.It also attempts to be a mini-encyclopedia, with miniscule biographies of mostly American personalities, illustrations and photographs and little tidbits of information. This diffuses the work, rather than complements it.What it lacks in etymology and usage, it tries to make up in presentation. The result is disappointing. As a dictionary, it lacks the substance and authority of either Oxford or Merriam Webster.On the plus side, it is reasonably ""up to date,"" and has some useful appendices. If you collect dictionaries, add it to your shelf as an intersting secondary source. Otherwise wait for a new Oxford for a truly definitive dictionary."
2,um its a little different from my imagine,"its a little different from my imaginebut its really cool, so professional and beautiful"
3,It's like a cyclopaedia not a dictionary,BADS1.heavy:7.9 pounds(3.58KG)2.pronunciation symbol not KK or DJ3.a few example sentence
2,American Heritage Dictionary,I made a mistake with this purchase. I should have purchased a collegiate dictionary; I did not need the pictures!! I will give this book to my preteen-age nephews; they will benefit from its use.
2,Gift for a Graduate,"I wanted to give a dictionary that would serve not only a high school student but would be useful for a whole lifetime. This was my choice after checking out many offered at Amazon at a real live bookstore, after which I came back to my computer and took advantage of both the special pricing and the direct shipping to my graduating granddaughter. She was delighted."
5,World Class Dictionary,"Awesome dictionary with loads of picutures and various definitions. I would highly recommend this for anyone, especially those with children."
3,Glitzy but Unspecialized,"I was looking for a dictionary to replace my 40 year old one. And one the kids would like. This is it for the kids, but not for me. Being a musician I found almost every other dictionary to be more specialized. The Webster's Unabridged was poor as well for music. Shorter's, Chamber's and the New Oxford Dictionary were much better. That's all if you don't have the Harvard Dicitonary of Music, a must for serious musicians. For the kids it is great. Just what the need through high school. But not a college dictionary. Certainly not for music."
4,Several pages damaged on corners,"Don't get me wrong, I love this dictionary. However, I'm only giving it four stars because Amazon shipped me a ""new"" copy that actually has several flawed pages. I suspect this is a copy that was supposed to be rejected but somehow slipped through a hole in the quality control and ended up being shipped to me. The defect is annoying and makes me feel like I paid a new price for a damaged product. Otherwise, the defect does not interfere with the use of the dictionary."
2,too politically correct,"This dictionary is too politically correct. It short-changes the great American leaders - minimizing their contributions, while going into great detail about other historical figures."
1,Boring.,"""You can't judge a book by his cover."" Wow. Wish I'd heard that before I wasted my money.I'll admit, I walked into this endeavor with high expectations; the book's cover is fascinating yet misleading. Instead of an intriguing story with a rich plot and interesting characters, I found myself reading a bunch of boring words (some of which I doubt even exist) in what seemed to be a chronological-type order.The book, which seems to have a very weak, loose story, also contains several inappropriate words, including both the female and male anatomy and some very naughty words that I find incredibly appalling, including ""sixty-nine."" My wife caught me with this book and grounded me for several days. I could not go out and play with my best friend Estabon, which was really terrible. Then I began to have uncomfortable bowel movements from being stuck inside for so long.Long and short: It's boring, useless, and a waste of your money. Get ""Goodnight Moon"" instead."
5,Awesome Dictionary!,"I received this as a gift from my husband. I love it so much that we bought a special table just for the book so I would never have to put it away! It comes in such handy. This book is especially wonderful because of its many color photographs and illustrations, as well as the numerous biographical references. Before I got this book, I thought ""A dictionary is a dictionary."" Now I know the difference between a dictionary and an excellent reference book and source of knowledge."
2,Appears to be comprehensive....,"The print is way WAY too small! There are a lot of entries. However, they are sparce on information. Some very nice extras - pictures, tables, etc. if you need that kind of information."
5,American Heritage Dictionary,"I've always enjoyed using (and just browsing) the American Heritage Dictionary, and this new edition is better than ever with all the color photos! The usage notes are very interesting and informative. I like it so much that I'll be giving this beautiful dictionary as a gift to some family members."
1,Frustrating and disappointing,"The fourth edition hardcover version of The American Heritage Dictionary is my favorite desk dictionary by far. But the paperback -- which I bought for reading in bed -- does not measure up. At least three quarters of the words I look up are not in the paperback. I've almost given up trying. Too bad the hardcover is so heavy and my bedside table is so small. Otherwise, I would have two hardcovers and happily dump the paperback."
4,-Buy One Now-,"If you do not own a current version of this dictionary, you are an idiot. This is an absolute must-have and no home/office library is complete without one. Highly Recommended!!"
2,Nearly worthless edition; false advertising,"This edition of AHD4 is essentially worthless. It is severely edited down, so you're not getting the full dictionary. Plus it's missing the appendix on Indo-European roots, which is the feature of the full American Heritage dictionary that distinguishes it from its competitors.You can get everything in this dictionary and more from free websites like [...]and [...].To publish an incomplete dictionary under the same title as the full dictionary is disingenuous and deceptive marketing. There is no point in paying good money for this edition."
1,The American Heritage Dictionary,This small edition is a bummer. The print is much too small to be of any practical use. Don't try to save money. Get the regular-sized one.
1,Beware!,"This is unacceptable! Print so fine a magnifying glass is a ""must."" Definitions at an elementary-school level. Flimsy greyish paper makes reading in dim light impossible. Refuses to lie flat. I cannot think of a single good thing to say about it."
5,Good Dictionary.,"Very complete dictionary, with contemporary words and dialects, and for the price it's a great buy, you can't go wrong!"
4,It is a dictionary.,Great dictionary. It helped me in class a good amount. Needed it for an etymology class. It is a Dictionary. Can't really say much else. Clear to read.
5,A GREAT dictionary. But it is heavy.,"I got tired of looking up words in my pocket dictionary, and not finding them. Maybe, I took a step too far in the other direction, but I'm finding all of the words now. This dictionary is great, with many interesting color pictures that catch your attention. The risk is, that I'll set aside the book I was reading and start browsing this dictionary. Note that it is very heavy."
5,The Dictionary Dilemma Is Over,"This dictionary is a gem for use at school, at home, at work. The color plates make this particular dictionary reader-friendly to any age from 12 years and older. The entries are complete enough for use by a sophisticated reader, but yet in language that is understandable to a younger reader. I have used lots of different dictionaries in the classroom over the years, and this one is certainly my favorite."
3,Buyer Beware: The Handsome Book is Flawed!,"After using ""The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language"" (4th ed.) on a daily basis for three weeks, I have discovered that there is a potential defect in it that prospective buyers need beware. The paper used for the pages of this dictionary is very thin, almost like tissue paper. When I turn pages in searching for a word, the bottoms of the pages become very easily chipped (small tears occur). I am very concerned that my new dictionary will become shredded within a few months. I have not had this problem with the same dictionary in the third edition; my copy is several years old. (Publisher please take note and use better paper in subsequent printings.)I still recommend ""The AHD"" (4th ed.) as a very good reference dictionary, but if one plans to use it a lot as I do, then ""handle with care."""
5,International Intrigue! Suspenseful! Dynamic!,"A female CIA analyst uncovers a possible traitor within the organization and contacts her supervisor. He instantaneously recalls a female operative - Code Name: Blue - the best ""wet"" operative in the field, to assist the analyst in uncovering the traitor. Totally unaware of her co-worker's true identity, one woman is blindsided by attempts on her life. Who is trying to kill her and why? Forced into playing bodyguard for the analyst, the operative finds herself staying at the analyst's apartment - in close quarters. Will ""Blue"" be able to find out who the assassin is before it's too late? Can both women fight the growing attraction to each other? Do they even want to? What happens to a budding relationship when Blue's true identity is discovered? And what if she's proven to be the traitor?Travel along the path as the writer weaves an intriguing tale of drama, suspense and romance in the world of government spies."
4,This is one ot pass on to a friend,"I wasn't sure what to expect from Paradee. So many fan fic writers of the Xena genre who gone on to publish their writings fall flat on their faces. Unable to make cutsey references to the show, or go on and on about eternal soul mates and all the crap. Paradee has done a nice job of avoiding this.It's only with the physical description of the main characters that I found negatively distracting. Every lesbian hero is 5-10 and up and her love interest described as 5'6 - please."
1,Don't waste your money....,"This game requires the CD to be inserted to be able to play the game. We bought our son a little netbook that does not have a cd-rom drive. I tried to copy the files onto a USB drive then onto the netbook, but it didn't work. If anyone has a good solution, please let me know.Also, I tried the game on my other computer and it was okay at best. A little advanced for my son still so I can't comment on how he likes it yet. Based on comparing it to other preschool software I've bought it doesn't rank very high. Also, an annoying feature, you have to click 5 screens or more to get out of the program which is completely unnecessary. I'm disappointed because we liked the BTB Can Do Zoo."
5,A lovely book,This is a lovely book and I always enjoy reading it to my children. The illustrations are beautiful and the words are truly encouraging and uplifting for little hearts.
2,"Nice illustrations, good idea, but kids were not interested.","While the sentiment of this book is sweet, it's really not the message that I wanted to give to my children about God. Fortunately they were completely uninterested after the first reading at ages 6 and 8. The message is seems to be God is in all things although it only focused on God being present during positive things in life."
4,You mean to say you thought it was a childrens' story?,"There's sooo much more down the rabbit hole this time. _The Annotated Alice_ is liberally spiced with glosses which illuminate hidden allusions and parodies Carroll makes on politics, logic, and nearly everything else. Some of these are so obscure they were an inside joke of only a few of Carroll's friends and colleagues. A story we always believed to be a charming childrens' fantasy turns out to be much less innocent but so much richer. This is an entertaining and eye-opening read that will appeal to anyone who loves literature"
5,Miles Davis in a blue haze,Blue Haze is another Miles favorite of mine that I have on the original two sided 45 record and wanted on the CD. Great on the originak record and still great on the CD.
2,There are better books if you are thinking about an affair,"I breezed through this book in about 90 minutes. There are three worthwhile chapters: Mistakes, Masters, and Contemporary Affairs. The other 30 percent of the book is entertaining, but not particularly enlightening. The cartoons did not add anything to the content. If you are contemplating an affair, the author provides some good common sense rules of thumb (don't leave receipts for sexy lingerie lieing around) but does not provoke thought or insight. This book is more suitable in the bathroom of a single person for entertainment, than as a reference. It was the first one that came up on my search, and the first one I read on the subject. I have since ordered two more in hopes of something more substantive."
1,Semiliterate and grossly overpriced,"If you're looking for a pamphlet's worth of dull, sketchy anecdotes padded with the author's shallow, self-absorbed musings and lots of blank white paper, trying to pass itself off as a ""book"" at inflated expense, then this is for you. If you're looking for worthwhile information (whichever way you stand on the topic) told with humor, then pass this ripoff item by and try Wirsch & Milot's ""Gotcha!"" instead."
1,Only for the scum of the earth.,Anyone contemplating or in a relationship that involves unfaithfulness and betrayal to and of another deserves to get caught and face the appropriate consequences and anyone who would encourages others to do so is sick and dysfunctional.
5,Great Gift Book,"This book is beautifully illustrated, designed and written. It is a perfect book for anyone who likes birds and an equally perfect book for those who love beautiful things. The latter might find that they love birds after reading the book. Overall, a very well done book."
5,"Perfect, Brava, A+, Awesome","this cd is amazing, it is perfect. I used to listen to alternative rock, but his cd is so good i've switched to country if you can belive that."
1,L A PutDown,This was a really cheap version of Heat. It really was disappointing and I'm glad Deniro and Pacino didn't see it. It really sucked.
3,Gorgeous but unreliable,"My wife and I love the look of this line, which we used throughout our entire house, but I was very disappointed to find them a little unreliable. I would say that 1 or 2 out of 10 just didn't work. Either they were completely dead or they flickered when installed. The rest worked perfectly. We initially bought them at Lowe's but then turned to the internet for extras when Lowe's suddenly stopped carrying the line. (I wonder why.) If I had to do it all over again, I would consider other options first."
2,Nice Looking but Faulty,"My Lowe's still carries Aspire's full line. I bought 4 of these, two of which just simply did not work. What a pain. Don't they test these things before packaging them?? I took the two that didn't work back and don't plan on buying another cooper product."
3,"Movie Great, DVD NOT","I love this movie and my criticism has nothing to do with it. The dvd was a disappointment. First, it bothers me that a widescreen version is not even offered. Second, the film seems to have been stretched vertically either to make it fit the screen or to make Pacino look taller. Check out everyday items like the wall phones to see how obvious this is. I found this distracting even though I think this is a great, and steamy romantic thriller and that Pacino and Barkin have great chemistry."
3,Good Pacino flick,"Pacino's magnetism is magnificent, and John Goodman actually lovable as an older Bronx cop teaming with Manhattan cop Frank Keller (Al Pacino) to track down a serial killer stalking lonely hearts. The plot centers around Pacino's undercover surveillance, torrid love affair, and eventual complete infatuation with suspected serial killer and steamy seductress Ellen Barkin.As in the film Fatal Attraction, suspense and eroticism are set at ""high"". But in Sea of Love, instead of malice and jealousy, there is blossoming love, respect, and devotion between the two lovers. (One's reminded of the novelEndless Love.) Slowly, Detective Keller's passion overwhelms his sense of duty, and even his instinct for self-preservation, as the suspect-seductress becomes the steamy lotus Keller can no longer live without - or go to sleep without.This lovably deadly film is superbly acted, well scripted, well filmed, and plot twists are few until the blindside climax.Good film."
1,Beware - full screen version cropped to fit widescreen,"This version (Collector's Edition)is worse than the previous pan & scan full screen version. Here the studio cropped the top and the sides of the full screen version to make it fit anamorphic widescreen format, so you lose more of the picture than the full screen version.Universal is deceptive in not saying it is a matted widescreen version Buyer beware!This is not a true widescreen and doesent even say that the original apect ratio was modified to fit 16x9 tvs."
2,"Great Movie, Terrible DVD Quality.","Great Pacino film, but the DVD has the worst picture quality I have seen on a DVD! I have both the old video and DVD of this film, I would have to say that the video release has a better picture quality than the DVD! The DVD looks grainy, washed out, faded colors and to top it off it is in full screen, and is single layered. Shame Universal Studio's for putting out a DVD of such substandard DVD quality."
2,Where is scene with Lorraine Bracco?,"In the network TV version of this film there is added footage showing Lorraine Bracco as Pacino's ex-wife confronting him at the police station. She is sick and tired of his harassing her and her new husband, and the information she gives Pacino is a release for him. It changes his actions toward them and makes him emotionally free to pursue Ellen Barkin.Aside from Bracco's terrific performance in this small role but important scene, there is definitely a gap without this footage. Why not add it to a new release? I would buy it in a second and rate it 5-stars without a doubt."
4,Another great Pacino film,"Pacino was at his best, right up there with Dog Day Afternoon and Serpico. Has a great twist to the story line."
1,So So,I don't even remember what it was about. Some type of detective/love story that was very slow and hard to follow. Would not recommend it.
1,Only Roland Green and L Sprague de Camp topped this for horrible effect,"All right, so let's get some lizard people, some shark people, a wizard who randomly becomes incorporeal, superpowerful electric eels, a city built on a sargasso reef (!), a nearly indescribable monster (apparently Perry found it so), a Conan who's apparently below the australopithecus on the intelligence level, and some hippy tree people. Mix all this with an incomprehensible plot and a lizard woman who screws anything male and two-legged, and you have this book. It's every bit as bad as it sounds."
3,middle of the raod for Perry,"Steve Perry writes another fast pace Conan adventure. Perry has injected some humor again into the Conan series. But it is not the barbarian that is funny, but the circumstances he and his companions are put in. But there is still plenty of action to go around. Perry story is a quick read, that doesn't leave one bored, but it does start to stretch out at the end. A good ending for the post part, but the killing of the wizard was predicable along with the toad creature. The book was a like a summer block buster, quick, a lot a bang for the buck, but a little short on characterization.-ERIC"
3,Just is ok.,"It works good, but when I was mounting it, the holder for the brake line, it was to small, so I needed to use a file to fix it. A little extra work."
1,OUCH!!!,"OMGosh: I saw this on Dr, Oz and while I know he is always clear that he is not endorsing any products on his Show, I assumed SAFE. I am now on day 5 of SEVERE PAIN! I purchased the Day & Night Cream both thinking better deal & better results. WRONG!! It burnt my Face so badly I am on Day 5 of recovery. I used the Day Cream, and then that evening the Night Cream. Well' I awoke to very red, tight, and irritated skin. It then went from that to turning to blisters, puffy swollen Red. So this is day 5 and the Blisters have now turned to raised very Red Welt's. I have spent the last several days just blotting Ice cold water to my Face to try & stop the burning. Day 2-4 I was not recognizable it is so bad. There is something VERY Toxic in this Product and I am going to e-mail Dr. Oz to try and get him to break it down like he just did on the Vitamin Weight Loss Scam. Please Ya All be Careful this is very Painful Stuff. Many BlessingsReviva Brown Spot Nt Cream/Skin Lght 2/1.5 oz"
2,Dark spot skin lightener,"I saw this on Dr. Oz. Thought that I would give it a try. So far, I have not seen a change in the brown spot. Maybe it takes more than a month??"
3,Who knows?,"who knows what the outcome of using this product is. maybe it will work, maybe it will not. time will tell."
5,A must for designers,"Even though there are many books as there are about digital imaging, none discuss in detail the relationship of designers and art directors with the process (and people) involved with creating digital images.This book covers a great many of the complexities of digital imaging with a clear, casual style that does a great deal towards clearing up many misconceptions people have about digital photography. Not only does it cover that, but the book goes further into aspects such as pre-press, proofing, editing and printing, and and does so with a very enjoyable, non-technical narrative. Anecdotal writing, along with supporting photography (beautifully printed) helps lend creedence to this book. A necessary text for anyone in graphic design and/or advertising."
5,Digital Photography for Graphic Designers,"This is a must have book for designers and photographers, especially designers of the old school who have been more then a little afraid of going digital and there are many out there. For the beginer designer, this book puts on the page what they will be told about the digital work flow as it exists today.Lee Varis takes the reader on a digital ride explaining more then enough to get the reader to appreciate the digital workflow."
4,Great for the Design Student,"Just fininshed reading Lee Varis's new book. It's a great overall treatment of digital photography for any student of graphic design or even the seasoned art director that may be new to digital technology. The technology discussed is current, and in common use professionally. The discussions of critical concepts of resolution and color are presented in a user friendly, easy to grasp manner.This book should well prepare the designer going into their first digital photoshoot. It can help in understanding how to achieve all the technology is capable of, and how to get the most from the shoot."
1,Waste of Money!! Don't BUY,This is the worst book. The recipies are like: Crushed Garlic. Peel clove of garlic and crush. What the !@#$%^ who needs a book to do that!!
1,Disappointed,"I was quite disappointed with this book. The recipes were not anything new or remotely engaging for a regular in the kitchen. Nothing stands out as inventive or as ""yummy-sounding."" In fact, I'm giving it to a friend who never sets foot in the kitchen."
2,Not entirely raw,"I find that there is a bit of misinformation on some things.Some recipes indicate ingredients need to be cooked which makes the food not entirely raw.I was sort of disappointed in his book.I have read better, and have many in my library.This is a good one to have though.There are many wonderful recipes and tips for the beginer on the road to Raw...."
4,"Easy, but",Her recipes are easy but a lot are very simple or start out like her ar the ingredients oh but 1 or 2 of the ingredients are another recipe in the book so now go find this one and also make that. It would be easier if she did not break them up as much.
1,Disappointing,"If you're a person who loves pictures in a cookbook, this is not for you. A lot of the recipes did not appear easy, but more time consuming. Definitely not suggested for those who are newcomers to raw."
4,Great accessible book for beginning raw eater,"I'm still exploring the recipes in this book, but so far they've been easy and tasty. I'm thrilled to have info on basic raw food prep including what tools and ingredients are needed. I am now learning to soak oats and nuts and gathering my tools such as a food processor, julienne peeler, collander, knives, etc. Lots of fun and I'm already noticing the energy from eating lots of raw!"
4,Great for Beginners!,"My favorites are the creamy avacodo soup, not tuna pate, stuffed bell peppers and the raw marinara is awsome! Some recipes are simple enought to prepare at my desk at work. The spiralized squash with raw marinara was a big hit!Thank you Jennifer!-BillDallas, TX"
4,Good effort,A well-presented work with some good alternatives. A good supplement to your raw food library.
2,"Good ideas, mediocre presentation.","I was rather disappointed with this book. First and foremost, a recipe book should make a person salivate as they look through it. The pictures lack clarity and good lighting, and the book's design is almost too simple. That being said, the author does have some really good ideas and tips for making up your own recipes. Think of these recipes as very rough guides, just waiting to be tweaked to your own personal tastes. Her dips, pates, and marinara sauces are delicious though, and in my opinion they make buying the book worthwhile. Just don't rely on it to be your main sourcebook. I should also probably mention that the author isn't as picky as other raw chefs about most of her ingredients being raw. One of her soup recipes is actually cooked. On a sidenote, most of her dessert recipes call for avocados, so if you're allergic to them, like me ( oh, the pain!), you'll have to do some adjusting or just find different recipes."
5,really yummy and really easy!!,"I am very new to raw food eating and so far the books I have found have been full of strange, hard to eat and hard to prepare foods. I have really enjoyed this book so far - I have already made about six of the recipes and all of them have been delicious (my husband loves them too). It also has great tips on how to make things like cabbage and brocolli easier to eat raw plus heaps of yummy deserts - none of which are boring at all! And I've appreciated not having to buy all kinds of hard to get ingredients or appliances - especially as I live in a small town with limited fresh grocery shops!!"
4,Very good but not everything is raw,"So far I have enjoyed many of the recipes from this book. They have been fast to make and have tasted good. I have, however, run across a couple of recipes that are not raw. I am sure they are good but should not be in a ""raw"" cook book."
3,"Nice but basic, not complete","This book is nice, with color photos (helpful when you don't know what something is supposed to look like). It is very basic, which is great when you are starting out, or simply want to add a few more raw things to your diet. However, it has no information on food combining, an important piece of the raw food lifestyle, and therefore many of the recipes are not properly combined. If you are a more advanced raw foodist, this book is not necessary. If you are just beginning to explore the lifestyle, you may want to buy some other books along with this one to get more complete information. Natalia Rose's The Raw Food Detox Diet is the best I've found. That being said, the chocolate mousse and cheescake pudding are wonderful, and better than other dessert recipes I've made from other, more ""advanced"" books."
3,Too basic,"Although I am new to the raw food world, I found this book too basic and not well organized. While the recipes are acceptable, I found only two that I wanted to use: Key Lime Mousse Pie & the Coconut crust. Other than that, I was very disappointed."
2,Lame & unneccessary recipes,"This book has some good recipes for salad dressings and pates, but otherwise not that great. Many pages devoted to things like Orange Juice. REALLY? Like I needed to buy a book telling me how to squeeze oranges? Let's not forget the equally compelling recipes for Lemon Juice, Lime Juice, and Crushed Garlic. Definitely buy this book if you are too stupid to peel garlic and run it through a cuisinart without instructions. I feel honestly frightened at all the 5 star reviews. Is the world full of people who can't squeeze an orange without directions?I also bought Ani's Raw Food Kitchen and Raw Food for Complete Idiots. Both books are bettter-written and have better recipes."
5,raw food made easy,this book really does make it easy and I liked her list of equipment. She doesn't make it seem like raw food is so hard you're whole life and kitchen have to change drastically to do raw food.
3,Common Sense Diet,"This is a good very basic raw food cookbook, if you are just beginning try this out. Simple and basic."
5,Best Buy for your Dollar!,This is by far one of the best raw food cookbooks on the market. Receipe after receipe I've tried has been fantastic! You won't be disappointed in buying this book.
1,Uninspiring,"I realize that the title of this book is Raw Food Made Easy, but I guess I didn't realize just how simple the recipes would be. To me, the recipes are all just common sense... like almost to the point of being insulting. I looked through the entire book and didn't find one thing that I don't already make (like apples juiced in my juicer), or that I found even remotely inspiring. Sending it back for sure.That said, maybe if you are not comfortable in the kitchen or have never juiced or made raw foods before, it's possible that this book would be a source of comfort to you? It's gotten really high reviews, so I have to think that maybe this book just isn't a good match for my husband and I."
2,Waste of paper,"The ideas and recipes are fine, but so many of them are way too simple to warrant a full page. Why does it take a full page to say: ""wash, chop, eat"" or for the more complex recipes: ""wash, chop, blend, drink""?Reader friendly with lots of white space...yes.Ridiculous waste of paper...yes."
2,just look in your fridge,"I've become curious about a raw food diet and this is one of the first books I've looked at. Most of the recipes are standards that any comprehensive cookbook includes. There are a few nice gems, but nothing that makes me thrilled to have bought the book."
1,Not what I expected!,I was dissapointed with all the recipes in the book. I thought it would be kid friendly but it wasnt. I was hoping to make food for my vegan baby but my ideas are better than what's in the book plus it seems like you have to buy more special ingredients to make the food from the book. :0(
4,Easy and yummy recipes - Great for the beginner,"Most raw food books offer tasty recipes, but they are just too complicated and contain hard-to-find ingredients. I liked that the recipes in this book were easy to follow, delicious, and contained common ingredients. My favorite is the Marinara Sauce and the Walnut Pate. I deducted one star because when I attempted a few of the entrees they did not turn out like I thought they would. However, maybe as I get better at preparing raw food the entrees will come out better too! Still, I highly recommend this book."
2,"Easy Recipes Made Easy, Because They're Easy","I cannot believe I paid money for a recipe book that includes recipes for carrot juice (4 carrots, juice) and orange juice (slice oranges, juice). Thank goodness I don't have to figure out those gourmet treats on my own... There are also one ingredient recipes for lemon juice and crushed garlic (take garlic, crush). I have never seen stuff like this included in a recipe book before. Did the author only have 20 real recipes and was asked to just wing it the rest of the time?I feel like I was ripped off. She could have at least helped me out with making ice."
5,Great for beginners,"I took a raw foods class at the Whole Foods Market in Ft Lauderdale, and the instructor recommended this book.I am good around the kitchen, but had no experience with raw foods preparation before, and this book was great. As a single guy, I was able to create quick and easy raw food meals that I enjoyed and did not have a lot of extra stuff around.Try the Mock pad thai, or the flourless chocolate cake. Great stuff!"
4,great for a novice raw foodie,"This cookbook is pretty simple, but I gave it four stars because I think it's a superb raw food book for beginners.It was one of the first raw cook books I ever purchased, and it made the preparation of raw dishes seem less foreign. However, I am an accomplished chef, so I did find many of the recipes to be way too easy. Even if you are new to raw food, if you have a lot of cooking experience you might want to find something a little more challenging."
2,Easy does it,"""Raw Food Made Easy"" is VERY easy--if you can cut up an apple, you are halfway there! In the grape juice recipe, for example, one only needs grapes, water, and a powerful blender. Jennifer Cornbleet's work is considered a seminal vegan work for some reason.""Raw Food Made Easy"" is poorly formatted--few pictures, it can't stand open on its own, and to make matters worse, the recipes aren't all that good. When it comes to raw food, go for the Blossoming Lotus Cafe's ""Vegan Fusion World Cuisine"" and Cafe Gratitude's ""I am grateful"" instead."
1,Kindle Edition Frustrating To Use,"""Locations"" are not the same as the quoted ""page numbers"", so cross references and the index do not help you find things. This is not a real e-book; there are no hyperlinks for cross references. There is also no formatting for Kindle edition; new pages display continuously instead of starting at the top of the screen.And many ""recipes"" are not recipes, as many reviewers have noted."
3,Not too impressed,"This is my first Raw food cookbook, and I felt that a lot of the reciepes were a waste of pages, like ""Fresh orange juice"" --Juice 3 oranges and serve. Duh, we all know how to do that, as well as carrot juice, and make apples and peanut butter. There were a few pictures in the book, not enough for a new raw diet book. Some of the reciepes I am going to try, the desserts looked great, and not too complicated."
4,Raw Foods Interesting,Great book with plenty of easy to make recipes. This book also explains everything quite well so that you have a better understanding of the foods and types of ingredients used. Just wish it had a calorie and nutrition guide for each recipe as well.
4,Easy raw food recipes,"Great little ""non"" cook book. Quick easy recipes to have on hand if you have a ""raw food only "" friend or just want to try out some new recipes."
5,Raw Food for everyone,"Jennifer Cornbleet's Raw Food cookbook is a great way to add variety to the Raw Food lifestyle. Her recipes are easy to follow and make and I've enjoyed several since I went RAW! She does a great job of explaining what to buy, how to prepare it, what tools are needed, and how long the prepared foods will keep if you make them ahead of time."
5,"Yes, it is Easy and Tasty, too!","I recently purchased this book and really appreciate the fact that it lived up to it's title!!! Of the raw food recipe books that I have (now nearing close to ten, a few of which were expensive), this is one of the easiest. I appreciate the fact that I can look many of the recipes up and prepare them in real time.Not to mention the fact that my husband LOVED the flourless chocolate cake and it was so easy to prepare! It will be a regular in our house"
4,It Delivers!,"This is the 3rd raw prep ""cook"" book I've purchased & the only one I use regularly. The recipes all use familiar ingredients, common kitchen utensils & short prep times. Before this book, raw food prep intimidated & exasperated me. Who wants to spend hours in the kitchen dehydrating, sprouting and soaking? This book definitely makes raw food easy & accessible. The recipes are yummy, my favorite so far are the Not Peanut Butter Cookies, and actually fun to prepare. The recipes can be simply adjusted to expand for more than 1 or 2 people.I also really liked the raw prep basic info that prefaces the recipes. The author tells you why & how to soak nuts & seeds, how to store & ripen produce, and how to follow the recipes in addition to other info. I especially like that the bulk of the recipes can be prepared using appliances you probably already have: a food processor & blender.This book is a great addition to the healthy home chef's library!"
5,A great book for Raw beginners,"Easy, quick recipes for beginners in the raw lifestyle. A must have for people who are starting on this journey."
4,Easy recipes for the beginner,"I was really pleased to find this book as I have been learning how to prepare raw foods. Most books I saw required a dehydrator and a lot of expensive equipment and hard-to-find ingredients. Primarily, the recipes in this book require a blender and/or a food processor, and the ingredients can be found in any decent supermarket or health food store. My favorite is the Zucchini Hummus so far. I can't wait to try the other recipes, including the desserts!"
4,Great Starter book for going raw,"One of the basic books for going/being on a raw food diet, even if you don't ""go all the way""Get this if:You interested in eating more healthy unprocessed foods if""you are thinking about going on a raw diet.you are bored with current recipes on a raw/whole foods dietyour limited on time.you don't want to spend a fortune on new appliancesyou don't want to spend a fortune on crazy foreign fruits and veggies even Whole Foods can't pronounce or get in stock.Even if you hate the cover, it's worth the contents!Be prepared to spend some cash if you don't already own some appliances like a juicer or blender and some odd items in the book (that I still don't have but I improvise)Note: The author sparingly uses spices for added flavor and recommends you find what works best for your palate, i.e salty, spicy, zesty. So be prepared to add some of your own ingredients for more flavors."
5,Great guide for raw food newbies,"I am new to the raw food world and found this book by Jennifer Cornbleet to be a fantastic introduction! The recipes were enticing, instructions were simple, and the previously daunting task (for me!) of making interesting food in the context of a raw diet was made not only effortless but delicious with the help of this book. The chocolate mousse and marinara sauce became immediate favorites of mine. The not-tuna pate in sushi is another meal I really look forward to. I have continued to be inspired to incorporate more and more raw meals into my diet from this book and recommend it to anyone else who is getting started in this healthy way of eating!"
3,Kindle version,"I downloaded the Kindle version. The recipes look great, but the pages aren't numbered so it's hard to find a specific recipe. It's fine if you just want to read it but not if you want to make a certain recipe tonight and you are on a hurry. You have to pay attention to the order so you know if you are getting close or if you passed it up. Also, the name of the recipe is at the bottom of one page and the ingredients are on the next. I wish I bought the hard copy or downloaded a different book. I would give it five stars if it was easy to use. I've read many raw food books do I was interested in finding the recipes, not reading it like a novel."
2,Okay if you are a beginner,A good start book but nothing to inspire you here. I bought it but never use it. Grab an Ani Phyo book instead. You will be thrilled.
3,Like the content but not the quality,The book is well written and has some great recipes but I would stay away from getting it as an ebook which is what I did for my kindle. It looked like it was scanned at home meaning poor quality and I couldn't print anything which is why i went with the download in the first place. I would recommend the book but they should remove the download option until they change the quality.
1,Very Easy......,"I was very disappointed with this book. The number of ""recipes"" having only one or two ingredients was ridiculous. I mean, Lemonade: 4 lemons; Carrot Juice: 6 carrots. I would think a professional could get a little more creative than that. I also found it annoying that the photos in the book were placed no where near the recipe they depicted. Bottom line, I was so put-off by the number of ""non-recipes"" in the no-cook cookbook that I returned it. I also just got The Raw Food Detox Diet and Rawvolution and both of those are excellent so far and are much more creative and helpful to a newbie raw foodie."
2,hum,"I'm bemused by the stellar reviews for this book. Some of the recipes are so obvious it's difficult to imagine why they are listed, such as one of the cereal recipes - place some (specified) nuts, seeds, and fruit in a bowl and pour on almond milk. Sorry that's not a recipe, it's just common-sense. That said, I will be trying some of the dessert recipes, although even with those there are some easily picked-up themes that happen repeatedly so the multiple recipes seem a bit redundant, like blending nuts and medjool dates to make a crust for tarts. But I guess the author has experimented a lot and I can trust the quantities she specifies. I would recommend taking a look at this book in a bookshop if you can, before buying it."
3,It has some good recipes..,"..however, there are some real throwaways too (a recipe for lemon water? Really?)On the plus side, the ingredients are very accessible, especially to people that already eat raw. Most raw cookbooks I've looked at are full of time-consuming recipes for overly complicated dishes with hard to find ingredients. This one is not. These are actually possible for those of us that lead hectic lives that don't revolve around the kitchen. I also really dislike having to buy an exotic ingredient for a dish that I can't/don't use in other dishes.All in all a good addition to the cookbook collection for raw foodists and dabblers alike."
5,CD,I have been looking for a CD with these songs. Packaged arrived promptly and in good shape. Would purchase again from this vendor.
1,Wow...just....wow,I got this link from adequacy.org . That should tell you something right away. This book is a waste of money and time. The only thing it's good for is beating your friends with.
3,way better than expected,"From the start there are plenty of signs that the painful nonsense is ahead: we have a young extremely good looking multi-millionaire cop surrounded by strikingly beautiful women, old buddy suddenly materialized from nowhere, sinister government plot etc.However, it proved to be a semi-decent mystery with semi-decent characters and even some food for thought."
2,a real disappointment,"I loved his/her first two books so couldn't wait for this one and couldn't wait to finish it (or plod through!). There was little suspense. Loosely tied together and what did come together, one said, ""Yeah, well so what...?"" Too busy, too many characters that gave little to the continuity or substance to the story. Wonder what else he/she writes under other name(s)?"
3,Relevant,The issues raised are even more interesting post 9/11. Some interesting characters will make me look for earlier entries in this series.
2,Can be hard to follow.,"This third book finds Conrad Voort tracking a list of names given to him by a childhood friend, Meechum Keefe. As Conrad tracks down these people he finds that so far all but one is dead. In digging a little deeper, Voort finds himself the target of some very dangerous and unsavory characters. This particular book didn't hold as much interest for me as his first two because it was focused largely on military/government, but as far as the actual storyline and plot, it was a little more intricate than Black's other books and very well written. Black is proving to be a top-notch novelist. I will definitely continue to read books by this author."
4,So sorry I missed this show!,"Awesome players, just as advertised. I live locally and I'm very sorry I didn't get to be there that night!!!I don't know much about the technical aspects of music reviewing but this disc is vibrant and emotionally charged in my opinion. I had never heard of the guitarist before this recording but found him to be very fluid on this set and look forward to hearing his own recordings.Tony and company are a precious commodity here in Columbus and are probably under appreciated!Steve Ealy"
1,Avid Romance Fan,"I agree with the comments of the reader from Boston. I only gave this book a one-star rating because there was no option for no star. This book was so boring I finally threw it down in digust, unable to finish it. That is rare for me as I feel compelled to finish what I begin. The characters are one-dimensional; the dialog is trite. The writing is simplistic, to say the least. There was nothing to hold my interest. It almost seems that the author created this as an outline, and then forgot to fill in the details with character development, an interesting story line, etc. This is the first book I have read by this author, and suspect it will be the last."
5,The parrot was my favorite part,This book was an easy and enjoyable read. I read it all in one weekend. The storey line had a good pace to it and I loved the parrot. Ms. McMasters must be an animal lover.
5,Truly thought provoking,"This is one of the best mangas ever written. With beautiful detailed artwork and a very deep storyline. Cry of the worm presents very important points in the world. Who protects the little people, is it truly great to be immortal, and what is the value of life?In the first half Rin discovers the owner of a sword that was stolen from her father's dojo and Manji means to get it back, but can he take it from one of the best sword fighters the Itto-ryu has. In the second half Manji meets up with another Immortal. Shizuma Eiku of the Itto-ryu. And he has a very important question for Manji."
3,In a dancehall style,"Good example of the dancehall bussines the Rebel is used to create, but this time with lower quality than other albums. Not a bad choice."
3,Instrument is Lacking,Psaltry has a good sound but very hard to tune. Strings seemed very fragile and there were no instructions or tuning guide.
5,brain-tagged fan,"great album, wish I would of heard of this band 15 years ago. I just purchased ""Dust Bunnies"" and also ""Pharmacy of Love"" simply said friggin great...Van dyk remindes me of Hynes.Got to love it!"
1,When authors are paid by the pound.,"The Wheel of Time saga is an uninspired, hardly original, badly written pile of junk. It is difficult to see a plan into its development, and the story sounds like a free association of words at the psychanalist's office. If The Lord of the Rings had not been around may be the Wheel of Time would have had a shot...but, to be honest, if the Rings had never been written, Robert Jordan would have had nothing to (badly) copy."
3,More about legislative policies than personal action,"A convincing and thorough manifesto offering plausible legislative policies or regulations that might effectively address the ""sweatshop problem"" in the garment industry, but lean on data for the personal consumer. It presents a theory on what those in power ""could do,"" and not much about what we consumers *should* do."
5,Studio and Live,"I got this CD and was totally mesmorized by most of these tunes. Lupri is making something new here and the space created between the vibes, Kurt Rosenwinkel's guitar and Mark Turners saxophones, tenor and soprano, really is something.Kurt is playing his acoustic guitar too at times and you can hear his signature vocalizing on a few tunes, which really adds to the dimension. Reuben Rogers and Greg Hutchinson are pulling it all together in the rhythm section and kicking it.I saw the group's CD release party at The Regatta Bar in Boston with all the players, except Greg Osby was playing sax. Totally smoking and a very exciting live show."
3,Is this a lounge act in Vegas?,"As an avid fan of the Spanish rock pioneers Soda Stereo, and a big aficionado of his first solo effort ""Amor Amarillo"", I found myself wallowing in the melancholy world of Gustavo's drunken stuper. Though it is obvious that Cerati has a wide range in music making ability, it seems that he simply tries to do too much, which in turn, results in a final product that simply isn't enough. Where have all the guitar leads gone? As far as his use of keyboards, I really miss the live flavor of such songs, such as ""Persiana Americana"", for instance. If you are open to hearing new sounds and experiencing new sensations, than go ahead and purchase Cerati's latest effort. After all, it may just have a Chia Pet affect, and grow on you."
1,Non Beautiful,"He sido uno de los más grandes fans de Soda Stereo desde 1987, sé que cada nuevo disco de Gustavo y/o de Soda es muy dificil de entender al principio, esto me ocurrio especialmente en Colores Santos, Amor Amarillo, Dynamo y Sueño Stereo, pero después de 4 semanas de escuchar este disco día y noche, tengo que decir esto con el corazón en la mano: este disco son 12 baladitas y unos soniditos midis insoportables. Qué te paso Gustavo ? Acaso evolucionaste demasiado que ya no te podemos entender ?"
5,Bocanada para el Espiritu,"Excelente, material, el cual recomiendo bastante para todas las personas que deseen escuchar musica llena de inspiracion y de propuestas interesantes, con una excelente produccion y un sonido bastante cargado de bass este disco es una verdadera joya que no puede faltar en la coleccion de las personas que gustan del rock en español."
5,"Exelente, muy bueno.","Este es uno de los mejores discos del año sin duda alguna, el nivel de musical y de composición de este disco es bastante alto. Este disco muestra a un Cerati reinventado, un Cerati que mustra su dedo medio a su pasado y sus ojos y mente enfocados hacia el presente y el futuro de su carrera."
5,Una Bocanada espectacular de Gustavo Cerati,"Tras haber escuchado el disco una y otra vez llegué a la conclusión que es el mejor de toda la discografía de Gustavo. El tema que más me gustó fue ""Paseo Inmoral"" aunque en general no hubo ninguno que no me gustara. Objetivamente le recomiendo este cd a todos los que estén leyendo esto. Saludos, Silvana Carla Cerati Clarke."
3,"Bocanada: Not as good as I expected, buy still buyable","Being a Soda Stereo fan, I anticipated the release of this solo album by Cerati; but it was somewhat of a dissappointment. I expected it to be better. I like the concept of it, the programming, the sampling, the coordination, the sound fx, the vocals, but it lacks good songwriting. I know he can write better songs than those in BOCANADA. Also, the sound quality is not that great. It sounds like it was rushed in order to meet a deadline. The songs aren't catchy like in his Soda Stereo days. His guitar chops are minimalistic (I've heard better from him).It is dark but pop at the same time. AMOR AMARILLO, his first solo album while he was with Soda Stereo is way better. All in all, I would still buy the album , but could live without it. Songs that I personally like: Tabu, Engana, Bocanada, Puente, Beautiful, Verbo-carne, Raiz. The rest of the songs, in my opinion, are just filler."
5,Bocanada is a masterpiece,"Gustavo Cerati's Bocanada is a masterpiece. It offers an engrossing and ambitious collage of musical influences done with consummate artistry. Lyrically it is mysterious and poetic. The album is a sonic departure from Cerati's work with Soda Stereo. Gustavo Cerati is Latin-America's finest Rock-Pop exponent and this work, Bocanada is a musical landmark. Buy it now!"
5,Amazing,The songs on this cd are amazing. Not only recorded but live as well. Cerati continues to amaze me. The lyrics are beautiful and really fit with the mood of the songs. Even the electronic songs seem to speak through the leading melody. This cd is amazing!
1,Disappointed,"I was very disapointed with this keyboard mouse combo. I specifically bought it because I need PS2 keyboard/mouse. The thin clients I use have the PS2 connectors close together therefore the usb to ps2 adapters don't fit.Not only wasn't this a PS2 keyboard/mouse, but it only contained a single usb to ps2 adapter, so even if the adapter would fit, I would need to go out and purchase another.A terrible example of false advertising."
3,"At times, wonderful. Important book...",I wish I liked this book more. Some of the seven stories were wonderful and rambly. Others just left a lot to be desired. I did like the story with the drama students. All 7 stories follow different parts of Rocio Esquibel (the main character)'s life...told in a unique voice.
4,Unexpectedly surprised,"I bought this CD in thinking it would be harder edged like Godsmack but I was extremely surprised to find it more along the lines of a modern day Alice in Chains. My friend was trying to say it was like a Nirvana meets Green Day but I think that is only due to the fact they do a marvelous cover of ""In the Pines""For my money this album has been well spent. I would reccommend it for all those people tired of main stream rock that radio has beaten all the fun out of."
2,yeeow.,"harry pussy not exactly up to par on this one. basically just overdriven room noise and tape hiss. conceptually fine, just not much to listen to. new comers would be better off with '1992-95' on siltbreeze i think. better still that brilliant LP i never knew the title for, perhaps the small line of text on the cover was a title: ""in an emergency you can sh*t on a puerto-rican whore"". still, a blast to pull out at parties and a must for any DJs who want to screw with people's heads."
5,The Complete Hamburger,"This is a Great Book, written by the REAL Ronald McDonald from the family that started McDonalds. I found it funny, entertaining and very informative. The reciepes will astound you and I am not a good cook. The History part was very interesting. Mr. McDonald is truly the Worlds Expert on Hamburgers and it shows in his book."
1,Poor customer support .Be prepared to pay to get their programs to work.,"Symantec is trying to produce better products this year.However their tech and customer support is very very poor out of India. Symantec is set up to charge first and talk later.This has cost symantec customers much grief,and many failed installs,to boot!!.I have a copy of 2007,but uninstalled when my computer crashed.They tried to charge me,but i refused.When you have a failed install or older versions on the machine,you need to use Their special clean-up tools.I would wait a few months for symantec to iron out this years bugs.Thank you Stewart L."
1,Fatal Incompatibility Problem,"I've been a loyal Norton anti-virus & utilities software customer since the stone age, but like several other reviewers, I'm deeply disappointed that Norton Internet Security 2007 is incompatible with ZoneAlarm Pro, Sunbelt CounterSpy, and Microsoft AntiSpyware, and even more deeply disappointed that I had to crack the shrinkwap to find that out. Once upon a time, Norton was the epitome of well-designed, thoughtful, customer-centric software, but they've degenerated into outsourced hacks trading on a well-established name. I'll be returning Symantec's software if I can, and buying ZoneAlarm's A/V package instead."
1,WARNING!! Will not install over Norton 06 Internet Security,"WARNING!! This was the worst experience I ever have upgrading software from the same co. I have Norton Ghost, Partition Magic, and 06 Internet Security on my laptop. After instructed to remove 06 IS, I installed the 07 Antivirus. Afterward I kept getting a pop-up Runtime Error msg and the product will not work. I went to the support site and follow the instructions to use their Autofix tool to completely remove all of 06 IS and LiveUpdate. I did so and reinstalled the Antivirus. STILL GOT THE SAME @#$%^ ERROR! I went back to the support site and was told to remove the old IS and upgrade to a new LiveUpdate first. I did so and reinstalled Antivirus. STILL GOT THE SAME @#$%^ ERROR! I called support and waited 30 mins. Finally was told I needed to pay $29 fee for live help. I returned the product and vow to never buy from Symantec again. I purchased CA Internet Security and installed without any problem."
4,Does what it says...,"I have been using the Norton AV for a while now....does what it says. Got a good price for 3 systems license, the rebate came on time. The only little gripe is that Norton products hog a lot of memory and they need to do something about it. For this particular version, after reading all the reviews and elsewhere, I contacted Norton and they also suggested to uninstall any previous versions and then install fresh. Followed that and did not get any problems. They even have a uninstall utility for the previous version. Beats me why they cannot have a clean upgrade path but thats how it is."
1,you can't use this product on a 64-bit system,"Even though there is absolutely NOTHING on the packaging to indicate this software is only compatible with a 32-bit system, it would not allow us to install it to our 64-bit system. Customer-no-Service was an absolute joke.The individual we dealt with did not have the best grasp of English and it took several tries to explain the situation to them. Their final suggestion was that we purchase Symantec's 64-bit software version. Well...we will purchase someone's 64-bit virus protection software, but I am fairly certain this is the LAST Symantec product we will purchase for quite sometime."
4,good buy,"norton 2007 is good but it is not as compatible as 2006. i love norton but sometimes, they get over their head as far as revisions and inclusions are concerned!"
2,Norton Antivirus 2007 Incompatible with ZoneAlarm Pro,"Upon attempting to upgrade to NAV 2007 from NAV 2005, I discovered that it wanted me to uninstall my spyware and firewall programs. I am quite happy with ZoneAlarm Pro and am unwilling to do that. I gave my 3-pack away to my cousin (2 of the three licenses will go unused)and simply renewed my license for the existing version of NAV. When that expires, I am going to go with ZoneAlarm's security suite which includes both antivirus and firewall support. When I have done this, all the computers in our household will be Symantec-free, and I intend them to stay that way. Symantec's poor support and incompatability are inexcusable ."
1,Terrible Antivirus Software. DO NOT BUY IT!,"Norton Antivirus 2007 is a terrible software. I tried to install it under Win XP. It is extremely unstable. There are so many ""unexpected error, please bala bala ...."". Everytime there is an red-x error sign on the icon, I can't figure out if it is working or not. If there is a time to consider buying NAV 2007, DON'T CHOOSE NAV!"
5,A great addition to our train set,I bought this bridge because the one that came with our train set was always falling down when my 2 year old played with it. This one is much sturdier and easier for him to fix if it becomes disconnected to the rest of the tracks. He loves sending his trains up and down the hill!
3,Not as nice as a Thomas bridge,"We have 2 bridges for our train set, this one and one that is an actual Thomas brand. It's a little short, but we don't have issues with the trains my daughter has getting stuck under it like I've seen others say. Her trains seem to derail more going over the top of it than they do with her Thomas bridge. I do a new layout for her every few days, I often leave this piece out, though we always use the Thomas one."
3,Not good as a tunnel,"This product makes a fine bridge, but you CANNOT fit Thomas or Chuggington trains through the tunnel. We wanted trains to be able to fit underneath and they were all too tall."
4,Good Tasting Darjeeling,"I bought this because Amazon was out of the Two Leaves & a Bud Assam (which is my favorite). This has a good clean flavor - slightly earthy, smokey, with some lighter notes (flowery?). Since it's whole leaf tea, I find it less bitter and has a fuller flavor than most bagged darjeeling tea. If you like a bold morning cup of black tea, this might not be the one for you. However, it is lighter than the assam (or English/Irish breakfast types) and I prefer the darjeeling as an early afternoon tea."
1,Many unrealistic Receipes,I am returning this book because I feel the receipes are too unrealistic for me. I usually watch T.V. show and find receipes easy to follow and practical. However this cookbook is filled with too many exotic receipes and ingedients. .
1,Dust Collector,"I am a novice cook and when I received this book, I thought it would be user friendly with the all time favorites. With the exception of Marinara Sauce, I never heard of any of these weird extremely complicated to make dishes. Her instructions are not for the beginner and neither is this book. I have not used this book at all and it is simply a dust collector. I have not been able to learn how to cook Italian food and think I am going to try one or two of the male written Italian cook books which seem to be designed for people like me."
5,Lidia's Italian Table,A great cookbook which my wife uses on a frequent basis. Both my wife an I love italian food and have always enjoyed watching Lidia on PBS. We just had to have her cookbooks and were not disappointed.
3,I love Lidia but...,"this book is a little too ""involved"". I come from a big italian family, first generation here. The recipies are incredible, but a little impractical for every day. Try Lidia's Italian American Kitchen, that book is much better."
5,the perfect cookbook for those that already know how to cook,"This book is perfect for italian-americans who already know the basics of real italian/italian-american food: garlic, olive oil, parsley and often a little pepperoncino. Another reviewer complained that there were few pictures in the book -- well the audience that this book best serves already knows exactly what a kale bruschetta looks like; the beauty of the book being that it's inspirational, and a little different than Southern-Italian cooking. Lidia's from the northeast of Italy, but this is not austrian nor croatian food -- take what you know and use it to make ""gnocchi with butternut squash sauce,""""garganelli with pheasant in guazzetto,"" and panna cotta. Lidia's recipes are extremely easy to follow and are well-organized. They look like a well-educated female italian relative wrote out her best stuff for you. Expand your reportoire in a way that's easy and suitable for your cooking style -- buy this book."
3,A Good Resource For The Italian Cook,"I enjoyed reading Lydia's book, and have made several of the recipes. As the webmaster for my own Italian cuisine site Italian Food Forever, and a collector of over 130 Italian cookbooks, I think this one is a good choice. I found the recipes easy to follow, and the finshed dish always lived up to it's description. My only real complaints were that perhaps there were too many unusual recipes that the average cook would have no use for such as Wild Boar, or Pheasant. I also would have liked to see more photographs. The ones included were great, but in my opinion there weren't enough!"
3,AN OKAY BOOK IF YOU CAN FIND THE INGREDIENTS,"While some of the recipes here were superb, there were others that were wild and wonderful but not practical. In addition, some of the ingredients contained in these recipes were impossible to find in my little corner of the world. You can substitute some ingredients for others that are available but the end result will not likely be the same. Another disappointment was the lack of photography. After all, from a strong marketing perspective it only makes common sense to show what you are selling - in this case the recipes. People like to see the end result and presentation is half the enjoyment of the meal! While this book did not rate at the top of my list, the author's newest book, ""Lidia's Italian-American Kitchen"" did. It contains absolutely delicious recipes and the ingredients are not as difficult to find."
3,A great book to have,"Even though this book is made for the PC, it works for the game consoles that Tomb Raider is in. It does explain each level, although some are a little hard to understand. I notice that they missed one secret in the City of Khamoon. The pictures are good to look at, but because it is in black and white, it's hard to see them clearly. It is a good book to have in case you are stuck."
4,"IT KEEPS GETTING BETTER AND BETTER, AND MORE ADDICTING.","I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT WE AS A GAMING AMERICA CAN FINALLY APPRECIATE A HALF NAKED LARA CROFT RUNNING AROUND, SHOOTING UP AND SOLVING SOME PRETTY DIFFICULT PUZZLES. BUT I'M GLAD THAT A GUY OR A GIRL CAN FIND THIS GAME VERY ENTERTAINING TO PLAY. THE BOOK HELPS, BUT IT WON'T DO THE FOOT WORK FOR YOU, SOME BOOKS MAKE IT TOO EASY TO PLAY GAMES, BUT THIS ONE GUIDES YOU ALONG JUST ENOUGH TO KEEP YOU GUESSING. THE ONLY THING IS, THE WRITING IS IN RED, WHICH MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT TO READ AFTER FOUR HOURS OF PLAYING.ALSO WHERE ARE THE CHEAT CODES TO MAKE LARA RUN AROUND NAKED?!!! IT'S HARD ENOUGH TO GET MY BOYFRIEND TO WATCH THE GAME LONGER THAN TWENTY MINUTES, SO IT WOULD BE GREAT IF HE HAD SOMETHING MORE INTERESTING TO LOOK AT. BESIDES IT WOULD BE NICE TO SEE AN ALREADY PHYSICALLY CHALLANGED FEMALE TO RUN/SWIM AROUND BUTT NAKED. IT GIVES THE REST OF US FEMALES THE INCENTIVE TO DO THE SAME, WELL MAYBE. SCREEN NAME SELUNA77"
3,Helpful toward completing levels but poorly written.,"This book obviously reduced the hours I would have spent searching for secrets and solving puzzles. Unfortunately, it is poorly written which can confuse as much as help in many cases. It's inconsistent descriptions and gaps in thoroughness pose their own challenges. More precise narration would have improved this product."
1,THIS BOOK REALLY STINKS,ON LEVEL LONDON - Aldwych there is suppose to be 5 secrets and the book only list 4. I've also notice other area of problems as well. I'm wondering how many other problems will present themselves from this half baked book.
1,An Embarrasment to Reggae,"I bought this disk on the strength of the reviews here at Amazon. What a major disappointment this disk is. Embarrasingly amateur, with keyboard loop drums and keyboard basses, it is difficult to believe that these are well-known professional reggae singers as well. Another case of ""dumbing-down"" music for children, something definitely not required to fully engage kids with music (the outstanding Putamayo series for example is presented no frills, no dumbing-down). Good ""children's music"" inspires both parents and kids, and kids react positively to that in their parents. A shame to pay $... for this disk."
5,A great change from the 'ordinary' children's music choices.,"We keep this CD in the car and I look in the rear view mirror to see my 19 month old bouncing back and forth in his car seat to the beat! His favorite is This Old Man by Yellowman! These classics get you movin'! Makes a great gift, too!"
1,I returned this,"I returned this item - something I rarely do. I was very disappointed in this chess set, even though it was purchased for a child. The playing surface is heavy grade paper, but not coated in any way. It is sure to be damaged in no time since it also serves as the exterior of the case. The cheapest checker/chess sets come with coated paper surfaces. The pieces were plastic, the wood box itself was pretty cheaply constructed. Although I only paid $30, I've seen beginner sets in much better quality with wood pieces on wood boards for the same price. Overall, not at all worth the $$. Skip this one!"
2,MOR at Best,"Perhaps Crave has some nice moments, but it is too Middle of the Road to be gripping television."
3,Different... but good.,"I wasn't sure what I was expecting when I purchased this. It is different. It is not a movie. It's a documentary type film that covers stories of others lives in short story form, (hence the series). It gets its point across. It's got a good message. I did like it okay. I wouldn't want to watch it again though."
1,Disappointingly Short and Cliche,"The preview looks much more interesting and original than the stories actually are. While all the stories had potential to go interesting places, each was over in what felt like about three minutes. They weren't even digitally remastered (the preview was). While I found it interesting, I don't see it provoking much conversation in Bible groups, and the pastor's filmed introductions were just boring and redundant.C'mon, Christian film industry! I still believe in you! Try harder!"
5,I love this book,"I adore this book. It has helped me to understand my body's response to sugar. Since I have been following the book, I have not only lost weight, but also really benefited from less energy highs and lows. I wake up feeling more energized. The one thing that you should know going into this type of eating plan is that planning is key. It does take more time to plan the meals that I eat, but it is worth it for the energy that I have gained. Great great book. I recommend it to all my friends."
5,Great challenge for young puzzle lovers,"My son requested this puzzle because he has other ""see inside"" puzzles and he loves it. The pieces are not traditional ""puzzle shapes"" and that makes it just a little more challenging."
1,Ripoff!!!,"Even though I knew this was only an Audio Course, it is the worst I have ever experienced. The instructor rambles on and on - very boring and no supporting materials like pictures - it is just a CD. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!"
3,Classic pen knife .. But the USB drive.,"The twist is the USB drive. It works great but the plastic sleeve on the drive is not worthy if being in this knife. It is flimsy and will break. Mine did after only a handful of removals from the knife. It still works after some super glue and I just use it separately as a thumb drive. I now have a nice pen knife with a big hole in it. If your are not going to ever remove it from the knife it is fine. An aluminum or steel sleeve with a steel hook instead of plastic would make all the difference. Plastic=Cheap/Flimsy, Not what this brand is known for. Just buy them separate."
3,Enjoyable Read,"This book was entertaining, humorous, witty. Light reading. A good mystery. I will look forward to reading more by Jane Tesh"
3,"Enjoyable, but light","I enjoyed this light mystery, it was a nice read. I feel that this author will grow as she matures in her craft. I would like to see a sequel in the future."
3,"Enjoyable, Easy Read","A Case of Imagination is a light read. Perfect for a plane trip or while snuggling on the couch on a rainy day. It isn't super involved and remains lighthearted throughout.The characters are enjoyable, if a tad neurotic. The mystery is not hard to unravel, but the book is worth the journey anyway.Harder to figure out than the mystery is why the heroine, Madeleine, would be so hung up on Jerry. Although nice and supportive, he is a flake of the highest order and kind of a weak sister to boot.I guess you can't help who you love, but better her than me!"
1,This book fails because of a Weak Main Character.,"A hard read. I generally like light, comedic detective stories but I didn't like Madeleine because she's just too dumb. She got into just too many scrapes that could have been avoided by any person of ordinary intelligence. It seems like the author tried to prevent Madeleine from being a ditzy beauty queen, but she didn't quite succeed. I may try other books by Jane Tesh, but this is the last and only Madeleine Maclin book for me."
2,Not worth it.,"This book just wasn't worth the time. Find a book with a real mystery. At times I forgot what the mystery even was because of the number of background characters and mini-mysteries (none of which were intriguing or attention capturing). I think the story and characters could have been better developed to pull the reader in. This book was lackluster and non-memorable, which is why I am having trouble with this review."
2,Just could not get into it,I have tried a number of times to start this book but the first chapter does not hold my interest
3,It was OK,I'm not much into beauty pageants plus thought the whole indecision about her love interest was annoying because nothing was done about it.
3,Fun Cozy,"If you like pleasant cozies, filled with amusing small town characters, you'll like Jane Tesh's books. There's romance but no sex, no graphic violence, and no gut wrenching fear. I'm reading the third in the series right now. This book is followed by ""A Hard Bargain"" and ""A Little Learning."" There is some lack of detail that annoys the reader from time to time. For example, I'm on the third book and still can't tell how small Celosia is, or how big Parkland -- the two towns in all the books. However, they have a little of the Jan Karon ""Mitford"" flavor sans some details. You'll like the characters, and want to visit again if this is your genre."
4,Good easy read,I enjoyed reading this book. Was easy to follow and kept me interested. Looking forward to reading the next one!
4,Cute story,There were plenty of predictable moments but it didn't completely follow the standard love mystery. Good flow. And nor long winded.
2,Need a lot of filters to bother putting this in your camera bag,"I bought this when I brought my new camera and I think I used it once. I like to keep my filters in the hard plastic cases they come in as it seems safer. This might be a great tool for a pro shooter, but I really have no use for it."
5,Worked Great To Fix An Old Drawer!,The track on an old dresser drawer was broken and so the drawer would fall out every time I opened it. This part worked great as a replacement for the track and keeps the drawer from falling out.
3,The Cat Creeps,"cats are wonderful creatures especially when they are young, playful cute kittens, they chase their littermates, attack catmip filled toys, play with string and bite through telephone cords. Yes, they do or at least mine did. I lost the two landlines within hours of each other, not the line from the jack to the phone, easy to repleace, oh no, the handset line. Handset lines are hard to find, cost way too much and last about twnety-four hours around those cute little furrballs. So I got the end plugs and a crimping tool and haven't had a dead phone in weeks. It takes a try or two to get the crimp right and you do have to be aware phone lines are crossed between the handset and the phone base, so be sure to look at the wires before you crimp, but after that you can use the phone just like a real person. And now there's no excuse for not calling Aunt Fern in Winnamucka."
4,Great versions of great songs,"With the talent here (Grisman, Jim and Jessie, Hot Rize, Skaggs) and the legendary songs, there's almost no way this could fail. And it certainly doesn't. From Tony Furtado and Tim O'Brien on ""Constant Sorrow"" to Vern Williams hearty ""You'd Better Get Right"" this is a great collection. Good mandolin picking too."
2,"Not so ""Natural""","It turns out that several recipes call for some rather unnatural ingredients including ammonia, turpentine, gasoline, and chlorine bleach. I'm returning my copy because when I label something as 'natural', that means it doesn't mess with the environment after it goes down my drain. A major disappointment."
5,Absolutely beautiful cleaning book!,"I first picked this book up while perusing in my local bookstore and then had to purchase it from Amazon right away. It is not only beautifully laid out and designed, but it gives a sense of beauty to the whole concept of natural cleaning. While everyone has their own ideas of what comprises ""natural"" cleaning, Casey's recipes are by far less harmful than most of what we American's can buy in the supermarket today and also considerably cheaper in many aspects. Overall a wonderful book and one which makes me want to check out all the books this author has produced!"
2,fania allstar cali concert,I have seen better I hoped to see something deferente but I guess wrong lost of my money I do spend I lots of money with amazon. It was the same thing with the Fania same old thing !!!!!!
3,The Sandy Bottom Orchestra,"IF I was a teenager I'd probably enjoyed it, but alas those days are gone and could be why this GK book is towards the bottom of my favorite's list."
3,A So-So Collection of Diamanda's Live Recordings,"This collection paled in comparison to Diamanda's 1998 release ""MALEDICTION and PRAYER"", which I can listen to non-stop. There are bright moments in this cd, which being in the intro for ""BABY'S INSANE""(which she penned), she says how a critic gave her a bad review on this song while performing it in San Francisco. She had me giggling. She reprises three songs that appear on some of her other cd's such as: ""SEE THAT MY GRAVE IS KEPT CLEAN,"" ""MY WORLD IS EMPTY WITHOUT YOU,"" and ""I PUT A SPELL ON YOU"". I'm assuming some of the other songs are her interpretations of blues songs. My picks in order if you want more of ""singing"" Diamanda as opposed to speaking, shreiking, moaning etc., performance artist Diamanda are as follows: ""MALEDICTION and PRAYER"", ""THE SINGER"", ""LA SERPENTA CANTA"", her rocking out album with JOHN PAUL JONES- ""THE SPORTING LIFE"" and ""DEFIXIONES, WILL and TESTAMENT."""
5,Very happy with my purchase,These blocks are very well made. For a block 'starter' this is perfect. I would recommend this brand of blocks to anyone interested.
1,Beware - You don't get everything in the picture!,"Look very very carefully at the picture. See that small arrow? That rectangle piece its pointing too? Ya, that is the only piece you get. For 9 dollars that's ridiculous. The small part that I di getd is just super cheap thin plastic.I gotCosmetic Holder (Clear) (11 3/4""W x 3 1/2""D x 3 1/2""H)at the same time too see which I like better and it's SOO much nicer and only 10 dollars more."
5,YOUNG REN SICCNESS AS ALWAYS,"This album is a masterpiece. There are no other words. THIS IS ONE OF THOSE ALBUMS YOU CAN PLAY WITHOUT SKIPPING A TRACK. SICC MOBBSTYLE LAIDBACK KINDA FLOWS TO SICC ASS BUMPING BEATS. LIKE STRAWBERRIES WITH CREAM, A STR8 CLASSIC. FROM TRACKS LIKE SMALL CITY, TO SERVIN' EM UP, TO LIVIN IN DA STRANGE, AND ROOKIE TO THE GAME. ALL OF THEM ARE SICC. Extremely rare to find as are all of Doja Clik's albums, get it if you can and if you don't have this album, YOU MUST BE AS BUSTA or in other words, YOU'S JUST A SUCKAA. PEEP GAME."
3,Does the job,so far it works good. Does its job. Its very light in weight. Made out of the cheapest plactic. So be careful when using it and store it in a safe place.
3,"cheap plastic, slow speed, but still lasting","purchased this product about a year ago. It's basically like other cheap stuff made in china. Very cheap plastic, part of the plastic inside broke with in a month, but it's been functional. Still using it. Does what it should.."
1,Mini All in 1 Card reader,Bought 3 of this a while back and they were all working for a month or so. One I left it plug in to my desk top for a couple of hours then it got warm so I unplug it. I waited for to cool off and then plug it back in then it wasn't working anymore. The other two didn't work after two months. They are cheap and convenient to use but it's not worth it to buy.
5,my customers love them,bought for my customers who did not know what to do with thier camera cards. these work well I like the LED in it
1,just say no......,"i plugged it up, it lights up, i put in thirteen different cards and it didnt read a single one. took those same cards and put them in the laptop card reader and had no issue, then i tried them on my hp dekstop, no problem, junk."
1,did not work,did not work as expected I was really disappointed with the reader as it did not work as intended no go
1,Garbage,"Garbage, worked 3 times.I believe that I left mine plugged in like some other users. It doesn't work anymore. Someone in China is laughing at us all the way to the bank :)"
1,My Fault for Being Cheap,"Within the first 3 weeks, the plastic cover came loose so I had to use tape to hold it together.About 2 weeks later, my computer no longer recognized the usb reader. I looked through the plastic and could see all the parts inside coming apart.Please consider spending a few more dollars for a better quality product."
2,Bad construction,"It works pretty well as a card reader. However, the cover is really fragile, and is easily to break out. Besides, the USB cable coming with the card reader stops working after just a few weeks. I have to get another cable to work with it. Anyway, its quantity is reflected by the price."
1,Performance is very slow,"I would not recommend this item at all, This items performance is very slow, probably because of the wire it uses to transfer the data, buy the one which does not use any cord."
2,Not recommended,This item physically broke the third time I used it. The Compact Flash slot was not big enough to acommodate the card well. Took a lot of pressure and wiggling to get it in.
2,NEED SOMTHING THAT WORKS WITH MINI SD,"it is hard to get the mini sd card to fit in right, but you know you did it when the light goes on. After that my computer never recognizes it. I have ordered numerous amazon products to do this and i cant find one that works, even on my pc. i had one that broke during use, and thats the best i have gotten. does anyone know of one that works for mini sd, especially on a mac?"
2,Wrong cord!,"This card reader became extremely hot on it's first use and actually caused my computer to shut down a USB port due to too much power being pulled by the reader. That said, this was easily fixed by using a thicker cord of the same type. Those of you that have Blackberries, you can simply use the usb cord that came with your Blackberry and this unit will work fine. So all in all this unit gets barely 2 stars!"
1,BROKEN,Speedy Shipping. Easy To Work With. But The Item Came To Me And NEVER worked!!!Well It Was Cheap So I Really Didnt Bother To Hassle Them For A Refund!
1,"Junk, Worth less than your time to read this review",USB port is not good enough to work with front panel ports. USB cable is too short. Memory device must be plugged in prior to plugging in the device. Wife is not happy. I am not happy.
2,recommend larger reader,not good quality . you pay a little and get little. san disk makes a better unit. lead data makes a good product.
2,Not compatible with Win XP?,"Firstly, this memory card reader is not sold by Brilliant Store, as the description suggests. Mine would not work, and I contacted Brilliant Store who said they could not trace my order, I should contact Eforcity. Eventually I got feedback from Eforcity, saying that it only works with Win '98. Yet the Technical details say that it works with Win XP.This is bad !!! I returned mine. I suggest you buy one that plugs directly from the body into the USB slot, without the cable. Also the cable was very short, so if you have a tower pc on the floor, the cable is not long enough for the reader to sit on your desk."
3,Almost thrown away.,"I almost threw this away, until something told me that try another USB cable. Once I replaced the cable, smooth sailing."
3,NICE LITTLE CARD READER AT AN AFFORDABLE PRICE,LOOKS LIKE YOU CAN ONLY USE ONE CARD AT A TIME WITH THIS AND IT'S NOT EASY PLACING IT SO IT WILL GET READ BUT THEY ARE BETTER STYLED AND LOOKING THAN THOSE ALWAYS BREAKING FOOTBALL COVERED JOBS THAT SELL FOR ABOUT AS MUCH AND READ ONLY ONE TYPE CARD. I'D RECOMMEND IT!
3,"Entery level, buy a better one","Locks up some times but I have not lost any data. If you can live with the lock ups then get one. I still use it, just pay attention"
4,Good product for the price,"Good product so far. I have only used it for two or so weeks, and has serve its purpose. Plastic case seems a little fragile, though. For the price, however is a good buy. Hope this helps."
1,If you're willing to wait a lifetime . . .,If you think it's reasonable for a seller to wait 3 weeks to ship you'll love these folks!
2,Short-lived,"This device worked the first couple times to read a CF card from my camera. Today, however, the plastic parts in the slot to guide the CF card into place broke and bent the pins used to read the card. Bent pins = useless card reader. I think it was only $2-4 anyway, so I guess I got what I paid for. I'm stepping up to a more solid Kingston reader for about $13. Should have saved the time and purchased a better one right away."
2,"Works, but slow 2MB/sec","I have this card reader but only get 2MB/sec read speeds off of a CF card compared to 17MB/sec on a different reader as tested with the ""steelbytes HD speed"" freeware program. It works and has worked for me for a few years, but my gosh it's slow!"
4,You get what you pay for,"For the price, you get what you pay for. Not the highest quality, but it gets the job done, granted i just received it earlier today, i can tell, its not meant for the long haul."
3,Well worth the cost.,"This little thing is great! I've been looking for a simple to use port to download my SD cards of all sizes. To date, I have not had any problems, nor do I expect any."
1,Junk,"Windows 7 cannot find a usable driver, so it is therefore useless. It was cheap in the first place so it's not worth it to send it back so in garbage it goes..."
4,Simple & effective little card reader,No fancy bells or whistles but a nice little inexpensive card reader that gets the job done. Probably would not stand up to a lot of wear and tear but for everyday use it works just great.
5,I loved every minute of it!,This book really made me feel like I was right along side the main character doing what he was doing. It made me trust in the Word of God more than I every had. It is a really touching and emotional book that everybody will love. Read it for your own good.
2,Avoid,"I wanted to like this book. The author set the main character in a very exciting time frame- Hitler's occupation of Poland. I was anxious to see how this character's faith would be stretched and deepened as a young man. But, alas, it is not well written. Character development is poor and large gaps in the narrative. I could go on. Read ""The Hiding Place."""
2,Foot tapping & Head scratching,"These songs are from Candi Staton's three pre-Disco Southern Soul albums [1969, '71, `73] recorded at FAME studios in Muscle Shoals, Alabama.The music is good, but the packaging is lacking. There is an essay, but no track information is provided (no years or personnel or even the titles of the three albums from which the songs are taken). The sound quality is decent, but leaves much to be desired"
1,NOT GOSPEL,I was surprised to see this in the Gopel Section let's not get it mixed up with Gospel or Christian music nothing close to it you can tell by the titles.
4,Nice and Simple,"This book was nice and simple. A good summary of what you need to know. The section on agency was great. I think he got a little carried away in the partnerships section when he compared RUPA and UPA. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who wants a comprehensive summary of the law of agency, partnerships, and unincorporated entities."
4,good not great,heavy on the UPA and RUPA rules etc. not a lot of the common law cases that we read in class. overall it did help me to better formulate a concise understanding of agency - partnerships.
3,Commonality between Jews and Buddhists,"Rodger Kamenetz is invited to follow a group of Jews and Jewish converts to Buddhism to visit the Dalai Lama to discuss interfaith issues. Kamenetz has an engaging writing style, and I've always respected the Dalai Lama, but oddly enough (as I am Jewish), the parts of this book that I actually had the most trouble connecting with were those relating to Jewish mysticism and kabbalah. I felt as if the book was arguing that Jews and Buddhists had to find common ground in their beliefs systems to understand and appreciate each other, and I don't think that's the case - I think that each of us should be able to respect others, whether they share our beliefs or not. Kamanetz does write well about an interesting gathering of people, making this a perfectly acceptable read, even if I didn't think it was anything special."
3,"Good, but...","This book has two main aspects. One, where he describes the conversations he has with the other members of the delegation that went to see the Dalai Lama, including his observations. This is overall, pretty interesting, even though I find his conclusions way off, and I don't like his judgements.The other part are the discussions, where first of all, he really does seem like a third wheel in this delegation, which makes his comments less relevant, if more objective. But the observations he makes here, and the way he presents the conversations are pretty boring."
3,Assimilation,"LAST YEAR I SAW Mr Dershowitz AT THE TRENDY TEMPLE WHERE RABBI IS A ""JEW IN A LOTUS"".I MEAN THE WELL KNOWN BOOK ABOUT JEWS FLIRTING WITH BUDDHISM BY RODGER KAMENETZ.ALAN DID NOT ASSUME A LOTUS POSE HIMSELF THOUGH HE PRAISED THE RABBI AND PROCEEDED TO LAMENT THE LOSS OF THE YIDDISH WORLD IN EUROPE.AH, ALAN, ALAN, WHY DID AMERICAN JEWS LOSE THEIR Yiddish LANGUAGE AND CULTURE? NOBODY THREATENED THEM WITH DEATH OR PROSECUTION.PERHAPS THE ANSWER IS IN THE NAME, ""ALAN"".THERE WERE NO ALANS IN THE PALE OFEASTERN EUROPE.THE BLACK SEA LITTORAL:ALANS BECOME OSSETIANSALANS BECOME HUNGARIANS"
3,Index needed.,A very detailed book that would have benefitted the reader with an index. Still its conclusion of Jewish renewal was heartening.
4,So enlightening!,"Truth be told, I found this book to be a slow read. I had to use more of my brain that usual. The concepts were, (and I hate to use this term), deep. So I had to read carefully instead of skimming. But I was so, so blessed! The sweetest thing is the way it captured my heart, just thinking about it gives me a sense of peace-- I found a shul I love because of this book (P'nai Or), and I fell in ""love"" with Blu Greenberg because of this book. It lovingly showed that we are all on a path to G-d, regardless of our ""differances"". This is the book I grab when I feel estranged from the G-d. I cannot recommend it enough."
3,pretty good,"Although _The Jew in the Lotus_ offers a wide array of opinions, it doesn't cover them entirely evenly. While I am not Orthodox, I was disappointed to find Orthodoxy over-simplified, usually in a denigrating way. If this book aimed at pluralism, it certainly failed, as it perpetuated the same misconceptions every non-Orthodox Jew learns about their stricter brethren.Still, it did offer a well-deserved commendation of the Jewish Renewal Movement, and was overall an interesting book, though I do wish that it had offerred a deeper look at Buddhism.Stylistically, it was decently written, but tended towards the chatty."
5,"Jews, Buddhists and Spiritual Seekers alike will greatly benefit from this book.","I try to write only positive and good reviews. If I don't find anything good or positive about a product I chose not to review it at all. I guess I am always hoping there is still something positive in it for the next person. Having said that: I cannot begin to tell you what this book did for me. Opening my mind on many levels it helped me to redefine my Jewish Spiritual journey. Up to this point I was spending a great deal of energy in multiple directions.On the learning level I did not really expect much. But it seems the combination of, what should be documentation about, an historical event conveyed as it was experienced by a poet, reaches out to the reader. There is so very much to experience here for every level of Jewish and Buddhist commitment.Open the cover and wade on in!"
4,Even better the second time around,"I read this book twice, and in the intervening years I had learned more about Jewish mysticism and meditation. As a result, I got a lot more out of the book the second time around. I suspect I would find it even better if I knew more about Buddhism.Rabbi Yitz Greenberg, one of the Jews who met with the Dalai Lama, perhaps summed up what was most important about this meeting between two ancient religions:""All religions,"" he said, ""not just Judaism, are now being placed in a new situation. At first I thought the culture was forcing us. But I've come to believe this pluralism is God's will. Can you learn to propagate your religion without using stereotypes and negative images of the other? If we can't. all religions will go down the tubes-and good riddance-because we're a source of hatred and demolition of other people."""
3,Oral-B Pulsar Toothbrush,"I have been using the Oral-B Pulsar toothbrush for about three weeks. I probably brush longer than the norm, but after three weeks use, the battery has played out. The handle opens to allow access to the battery. It is a standard AAA alkaline battery. According to product documentation, the battery access is for ""disposal"" purposes. I have tried replacement and clearly they have designed it so that replacement is impractical or difficult at best. It should be redesigned for battery replacement. Otherwise, I like how it works.Oral-B Pulsar Toothbrushes, Head Size: Regular(40), Type: Medium - Each"
3,"LOVE it, but battery life WAY TOO SHORT","I was so excited after using this toothbrush that I was like a walking commercial, telling people about it. My teeth have never felt so clean. But after only 3 1/2 weeks, the battery died. Too bad, because I really wanted to keep using it. It should last 3 months when you should replace your toothbrush in general."
5,Perfectly ergonomic,"I bought a second one of these keyboards. Not that the one I've been using at home for 8 years had a problem, but I wanted to make sure I had a spare in case they stop making them.The keyboard is comfortable, and the touch is just right. I have one at work and at home.If you are considering this keyboard, give yourself a few days to get used to it. You'll find yourself hitting the wrong keys for a day or so until you get used to it.Price on Amazon is very good also. This keyboard is something that Microsoft actually did right."
5,this keyboard takes the work out of typing its very comfy to use,My first one died after spilling water on it. It lasted 5+ years. I started using my backup keyboard which is a standard layout and it is very uncomfortable and does not feel user friendly at all. The new one I received is identical to my old one and feels great! If you type a lot this is the keyboard for you. There is plenty of room between your hands when using so there is no crampiness at all. Once you get the hang of it you will love it. Excellent packing by amazon product came in shrink wrapped microsoft retail box. Best price around from a reputable merchant. Thanks.
2,"Decent, but for two major problems",The problem with key layout (the ones to the right of the enter key) are covered in other reviews. Another issue is that the rubber bumps on the bottom of the keyboard are poorly fastened. We've got two at my office and both had the same one fall off -- making the keyboard unusable until we glued them back on. Unacceptable.
1,Never again !!!!,I had one of these and sold it because of the key arrangements that are mentioned in other reviews. If you like swearing a lot then this keyboard is for you! If you are a touch typist then my advice is to stay away from this one and get a PRO version. The best advice is to test drive a new ergonomic keyboard at a computer store before buying it.
1,Keys rearranged,I went and got this keyboard after the first one broke. I found the keys were re-arranged. Instead of hitting home - I wound up deleting my work.This is a keyboard I cannot work with. Model Number 1 and 3's were better.
5,spacious and easy,"I love this keyboard. I have had this brand/style for 5+ years and go back to it every time. I recently changed jobs and tried to use the dell flat keyboard that was issued. I soon realized that everyday I wished for my ergo keyboard back. I finally broke down and asked our IT person for one yet was given an Adesso 208W, which does not have leg stands and has many other (in my opinion)useless add-ons which waste valuable desktop space. The MS Natural Elite is basic and to the point. Granted you do have to use a 6pin to USB adapter but that is not difficult to hitch up. :) And ahhhh, your hands now have room! Also, the keys are responsive and right where you need them. My hands and wrists never felt so good. Don't waste your money on the rest, this keyboard will do the trick. You won't be sorry."
5,Microsoft Natural Keyboard Elite,I started using these keyboards at a former job. I now work at home and I wouldn't use anything else. My fingers can spread out over the keyboard and type with ease. No pain or cramping in the fingers or wrists. It's the greatest!
2,Noisy and loose space bar,"I have an old white version of this keyboard and wanted the same one for a new computer set up. However, the one I just received in black had a very loud space bar that was also too loose, especially compared to all of the other keys. I was unhappy with this new keyboard and had to return it."
1,Microsoft Natural Keyboard Elite for Business,"I bought two of these keyboards. The first one I received, the delete key kept sticking and deleting a run of things in my documents. Yikes! So, since I had one of these in the past and enjoyed it for years, I returned this keyboard and ordered another one. It too did not work properly. I think they don't make things like they used to - my only explanation. I don't know where to turn next as all the other ergonomic type keyboards are too big for my roll out tray on my desk."
5,I have this KB for work and home...,"I thought about getting 2-3 more just in case it breaks and they stop making it. Love it. The price is so right! Style, perfect.It's perfect."
4,Still getting used to it,"I purchased this due to high reviews and due to pain in my right arm. I have only used it for a couple of weeks and now I feel some tingling in my left hand/wrist. I think the upper arm pain is better, but I am concerned that the wrist tingling is new."
1,For UNIX?,"I really regret that I brought this junk. I was deceived by its stylish look, and when I started using it, immediately I found that the cursor keys and the page up/down, home/end keys are so awkwardly placed, making the keyboard virtually useless in OS where you absolutely need those keys -- like Windows. I doubt if Microsoft has made this keyboard for UNIX users, those who are used to vi or Emacs, where you type Ctrl+F to move the cursor to the right, etc."
2,keyboard,"This is not the keyboard in the picture, however, i kept it because I was in dire need. These are hard to find in retail stores."
5,This keyboard is excellent,"As an author, I use this keyboard because I experience it to be easier and more comfortable to work with than a conventional keyboard. It definitely has an ergonomic design. At first it might feel a little odd working with the keys, like this. However, after a short time, one will feel more comfortable with this type of keyboard. I think the design of this keyboard puts one's hands at a better anatomical position verses a conventional keyboard.Peace and Happiness,Patrick Leonardi"
5,Keep it classic,"I've used variations of this keyboard for many, many years. No matter what else I try, I always go back to this particular form and layout. I just purchased this black beauty for my new Linux system and I couldn't be happier. Quiet, precise, comfortable, everything you could ask for. I do wish Microsoft would make a wireless version, but otherwise this keyboard is a keeper."
4,Watch the height if using on a computer desk with slide out keyboard drawer,"Watch the height if using on a computer desk with slide out keyboard drawer. Didn't think about this and since the height of the keyboard(2.6 according to manufacturer) is different from the regular flat keyboards(1.5 inch). When sliding the drawer in and out the keys rub the bottom of the desk even though I have a 2 and 1/4 inch gap between drawer and bottom of desk which is probably a pretty standard gap on computer desk, measure first. Other than that it is great."
1,Evil key layout!,"My experience parallels a previous review. I also used the older Microsoft Natural keyboard (now the Natural Pro) and it relieved my persistent pain. When I accidentally killed my keyboard, I ordered the Elite model without thinking. Within a few days I was desperate enough to go back to a conventional keyboard. The arrangement of the Home/Page Up/Page Dn/End/Delete/Insert and arrow keys may allow the keyboard to fit in trays, but otherwise it is insane. I never realized how much I use those keys until I was swearing at this keyboard. The arrows keys are nearly impossible to use, especially for gaming. Unless you truly need the keyboard to fit in a tray, please stay away from this annoying, frustrating, and unusable keyboard."
3,Ergonomic Keyboard with one drawback,"I bought this ergonomic keyboard hoping to replace my old beloved Microsoft Natural Keyboard Pro. Unfortunately, I did not look closely enough at the displayed pictures before purchasing it. If you look closely at the arrow keys, ""Insert"", ""Home"", ""Delete"", and ""End"" keys you will see that the keys are smaller and arranged differently than a standard keyboard. I tried using it thinking I would get used to it, but it drove me nuts. I did not realize how often I use these keys. The numeric key pad and the regular typewriter keys are fine.In summary:Pro:Ergonomics are goodTypewriter keys and numeric keypad are fineCon:arrow keys and navigation keys are too small and in a non-standard positionkeyboard is wobbly and little flimsykeys are a little mushy when pressed."
5,Good ergo keyboard,"This was definitely worth the purchase. It was easy to install, and works great. The ergo setup of the keyboard is just as comfortable as a more expensive keyboard we had previously that broke. All in all this was a very good purchase for the price."
2,"Worked OK for about 6-months, but some keys no longer work","Moving from the original Microsoft Natural keyboard (which worked great for over 15 years), took a little adjustment - the original was built like a brick, whereas this is lighter and cheaper. It also has the newer, more compact, arrow key layout. Otherwise, it's was a functional, ergonomic keyboard, that is, until the ""1"", ""4"", and ""7"" number keys stopped working.Three-year manufacturer warranty, so have to decide if it's worth the shipping costs to get another one (who knows how long that would last)."
2,doesn't hold up,"just didn't hold up for me. the keyboard response was weak and just felt cheap. i have a similar one at work, microsoft but different model, and it is 10x better. i guess you get what you pay for with this one."
2,Microsoft is not making split keyboards well anymore. Ergonomics must not be making them much money.,"I've been using split keyboards since 1995, all Microsoft.I could tell the current keyboard (of 8 years) was beginning to skip letters as I type -- warning signal!So I purchased a new one which has now moved to storage until I am simply forced to use it:1) Keyboard clicks are sharp or tinny -- I think due to the thin materials used for the housing.2) The keyboard speed is maddeningly slow. I have tried the new keyboard on both XP and Win 7, set both OS's at the highest speed and still the keyboard creeps until I want to throw it out the window. Regular typing is OK, but if you want to move the cursor to somewhere else on the page that has no keyboard shortcuts, take a long deep breath. Deleting, whether forward or back is also annoyingly slow."
2,Better choices available,"I'm writing this review on a Microsoft Natural Elite keyboard. I bought it for the price and soon learned you get what you pay for. I've used ergonomic keyboards for years because they are much more comfortable to my arm angle and hand placement. The problem with the Natural Elite is the key action. Stiff and jerky. After an hour or so, my finger joints are sore. The adjustable height is an advantage, but virtually every keyboard has it. Only because I broke my Adesso (better, but not great) am I on the MS Elite. Spend a little more. Let this one go."
2,Broke!,"I purchased one of these on amazon.com a while ago. I never used it too much because I preferred to just use my laptop's keyboard for the longest time. When I got a desktop again, I pulled this one out of storage. After only a few days of use, the spacebar stopped working, and the number keys were either broken or typing strange combinations...I have never had this happen with a keyboard, nor have ever heard of it happening. I can only assume that these are constructed *very* poorly. I even unscrewed the back and looked inside the 'board. Nothing seemed wrong. Also, that arrow key arrangement is just as annoying as everyone has ever said it was. You *never* get used to it..."
3,NICE KEYBOARD BUT.....,"I do not like the bubble!!! If it was split but FLAT I would buy three & stash them away. I'm currently using a Belkin which is not as good, but it's the only one I can find that's FLAT."
1,"Old stock, been sitting around","This is a real butethe Microsoft tag in the corner of the box says ""Designed for Microsoft Windows NT & Microsoft Windows 98""the keyboard has a PS/2 plug on the end and comes with a PS/2 to USB adapter cord. I could have just bought the adapter...Must have been sitting around since 1999"
4,Fairly ergonomic keyboard,"If you aren't used to the split keyboard then it may take some time to adjust. Capitalizing the ""b"" key is troublesome, but that can easily be accomplished once one gets used to pressing the right shift key to do so. It's limited - it doesn't have quick access buttons for the Internet, for instance - but it is a good purchase if you want comfortable, accurate typing."
3,The arrows are very inconvenient,"I like the overall keyboard layout with the exception of non-standard cursor arrows, after a week I still could not adapt to them, and I use them a lot in my work. I have noticed that newer versions of Natural keyboard use standard layout for arrows."
2,What was Miscrosoft thinking?!,"95% of this keyboard is of a fantastic ergonomic design. It's that last 5% that kills you. Specifically, the arrow keys.Granted, most people won't need them, but if you're a programmer, then having arrow keys chopped in half and shoved into a non-standard configuration is a major shortcoming. Even at a 49% discount, don't buy this keyboard. Buy an ergonomic keyboard with standard-sized and configured arrow keys. Trust me, you'll be happier for it."
2,Flimsy and Delicate,"I have gone through two of these keyboards. I really like the comfort and design of this keyboard, which is why I bought a second one when the first one started acting up.I use the keyboard primarily for writing, so I don't pay much attention to the other keys or their position; although, I think some of the keys are a little too small.My first natural keyboard lasted about 18 months until one day it shorted and stopped typing the correct letters. I replaced it almost immediately with the same keyboard because of how much I liked the style and because I was so used to it.My new one, which I bought in July, shorted out after less than a teaspoon of coffe dripped on it. I've had keyboards that have survived major spillage, cleaning products, and being dropped, yet this keyboard died after such a small injury.I have tried to contact Microsoft to return it. It's not worth a lot of aggravation, but for $35, you would think it would be a little hardier.Not recommended."
3,Ergo Keyboard,The keyboard functions well and is conviently layed out. I did however think it would be more comfortable. The keybord angle I think should be more slanted upward.Maybe a more expensive model would be.
5,excellent ergonomics,"Since my initial purchase of an ergonmic keyboard, I can't type comfortably on anything else. After my first E board went belly up, I had to use a regular board until this one was delivered. What an inconvenience! My elbows felt locked together, and it was very uncomfortable - very tight and constrained. This keyboard is such a pleasure to use. The keys make a great ""tappy tap"" sound and the price is very reasonable. I recommend it highly."
2,lousy build,MS has changed the construction of the keyboard. The space bar does not work when hit on the right side. It is a major PIA. Reading other reviews the same appears to be true of all natural type MS keyboards.
4,Good Ergo Keyboard,"I use one of these at work and home. Programming for too many years, can't use a 'normal' keyboard anymore. This one works great, no carpal tunnel type pains. I bought this one to replace my home keyboard that just stopped working. I had it for 5 or 6 years, and I used it A LOT, so I am fine replacing it. The keyboard action is much better on the new one."
4,MS Wave Keyboard in Black,"I do like the smaller width and attached palm rest. Some keys have a lower quality finish, which surprised me for the cost of this keyboard. Functionally it works fine and matches the rest of the computers/monitors in this office area. Really like the fast free shipping."
2,Mediocre keyboard replacement,"My previous Mac compatible keyboards died after extensive use. I looked for a new keyboard which was Ergonomic and Mac Compatible. I found the Microsoft Natural Keyboard Elite. It looked OK, and was inexpensive (roughly $30). I ordered it and it arrived almost immediately. It is a poor keyboard. The action of the keys are stiff, and what is worse: noisy. I used it for a couple of hours, and gave up. There are much better keyboards which satisfied all of my requirements (ease of use, ergonomic, Mac compatible, quite, etc). They are more expensive (roughly $140), but in my personal opinion, worth the additional expense.Microsoft Natural Keyboard Elite"
3,just ok,I have used this kind of keyboard for years and have used Microsoft the most. But this one by far is the most cheaply made. One of the shift keys sticks. And worst of all no invoice was sent with it so it could be very difficult to return or exchange.
5,Best SImple Natural Ergonomic Keyboard,"I have used an earlier version of this product before and I've that version before about ten years ago. I've gotten used to the plus shaped aligned arrow keys and I love the design and the ease of installation and use, considering that I have the Microsoft Keyboard software (Microsoft Intelitype), which configured this keyboard on my mac. I don't know why the previous forty nine and odd so people have made a big deal of the arrow key size and alignment, but I love the keyboard over all and have learned to touch type with it. Thanks for an updated model Microsoft."
3,Good value for the price,I bought this to replace an older ergonomic keyboard and it has not disappointed. No bells and whistles (which I like) and it looks good with my black computer monitor.
2,Disappointed...,My bad for not looking closer. There are several issues I have with this keyboard:* Keys don't have that nice soft feeling when you press them like other keyboards (including a previous Microsoft model) have - very clunky feeling* Spacebar feels small and hard to hit for touch typing (programmer)* the arrow keys and home/end/page up/down keys are in an unusual orientation so now I have to go look and find the appropriate key where before I could naturally hit the right key without looking.I would NOT recommend this keyboard - it's cheaper than comparable models but if you're a touch typer and used to normal configurations then I'd steer away from this keyboard and spend a few extra bucks on something nicer.
4,my favorite keyboard,"I love this: no carpal tunnel, plus it increased my typing speed by about 20 wpm.My only complaint is that they've changed the design, particularly of the arrow keys. In the past, the arrow keys were as normal.But in Microsoft's latest outing, the arrow keys are all bunched together in a way that makes them hard to negotiate.This is a HUGE DEAL if you're into playing computer games.Thus I wouldn't recommend this keyboard if you are."
4,good old standard,"Still love the layout of this keyboard. I can't stand typing on a standard keyboard for over a few hours, and this one seems to fit me best ergonomically. It's a little pricey for being so loud (clickity click click), but still my favorite solution."
5,Everything I needed... almost!,"This is a great keyboard. I purchased this from Amazon after reading the other reviews. As others had noted, my wrists feel better using this keyboard. I like the slightly sloped keys for more accurate typing. Key sensitivity is good, too. My only issue was that I missed my ""calculator"" hot key on the keyboard, which was something I used frequently before. That being said, I am completely happy with this keyboard so far, and have experienced no issues with it to date."
2,Why make key placement unique?!?,"Why oh why do manufacturers feel the need to change something that's been established as a defacto standard?? In this case the arrow keys are not in their normal positions. Not only that, they keys for the arrow keys are smaller - maybe only 75% of the size of the other keys. If you're at all like me and use the arrow keys extensively, this is NOT the keyboard for you. It really annoys me too - there's plenty of room there to put them in their normal places and make them normal sizes, but no - Microsoft had to go and screw it up."
3,"Comfortable, but unnatural placement of some keys","I, too, find Microsoft's re-arrangment of the Ins/Del set of keys as well as the arrow keys unfathomable. Hmm, maybe the geniuses at Sony designed this one. :) In any case, this is a comfortable keyboard, and affordable, and I would continue using mine despite the stupid key placements. The multimedia version if a little better, at least with the inverted T keys. BTW the pro version is discontinued."
2,Touch typists (and programmers and gamers) beware,"First off, let me say that this is a pretty solid keyboard. No complaints about the quality.However, be aware that Microsoft decided to rearrange several clusters of keys on this keyboard. The arrow keys are in a diamond pattern rather than the traditional (and IMHO efficient) ""inverted-T"". Also, the home/end/insert/del/pg up/pg down cluster has been dissected and rearranged, which causes me no end of grief and mis-keys.As a touch-typist and a programmer, I've come to expect these keys to be in a certain position. I don't see any added value from Microsoft's updated positioning of these keys. However, they definitely do ding my productivity.Your milage may vary."
1,This product is a disaster,The keyboard arrived damaged and I have yet to hear from Amazon about a refund or a replacement. I am totally dissatisfied.
1,Spacebar so noisy it's useless,"This is the worst keyboard I have ever tried. It has the loudest spacebar you have ever heard in your life. I type all day at work and my wrists hurt. This keyboard is very comfortable, and the letter keys are well spaced out and whisper quiet - perfect. However... the spacebar key is so loud it would surely drive everyone in my office nuts, not to mention myself. I cannot possibly imagine how the other reviewers use this keyboard - try it and find out just how loud a spacebar can be.It is really too bad, Microsoft designed the perfect keyboard, then made it useless the spacebar is so obnoxiously loud."
3,"Great keyboard, lousy mouse","The mouse is rather lousy, and chews through batteries really fast. The mouse is so bad I ended up buying a different wireless pointing device."
2,seems defective,"The space bar on this keyboard seems as though it is lacking the spring element,,,it works, but doesn't feel right. I know because I had an identical one that did not feel this way before liquid got spilled on it and I needed to order this replaceement.When I contacted the seller, they said I needed to go through the manufacturer NOT them. That never makes me happy :-(Normally, this keyboard is great! But not this particular unit. If you are one that likes easy returns, don't go this route."
3,"The only game in town, not very durale tho","If there are typos in this message, it is ecause some of the keys on this very keyoard are dead now. However, I have been used to using a natural keyboard (gee the b and the x are back) and this one, aleit (dead again) wired, is the only game in town. Others are either ugly or not curved enough.Yet after only two years of regular use, it stops working properly. If there is another option to my liking, I'd definitely try others first."
5,Fantastic!,"I've used a Microsoft natural keyboard elite for 10 years now, and have wore it out, so ordered another. Before that, I used the original Microsoft natural keyboard. I prefer the elite, since it is narrower, and fits on a standard keyboard tray. These keyboards have saved my wrists. I'm a software engineer, and use a keyboard for 8-10 hours a day, for 20 years. I developed ulnar nerve deviation syndrome (similar to carpal tunnel, but ulnar is one of the other tunnels), which was quite painful. Switching to this keyboard allowed my wrists to remain neutral, and gradually may pain went away (took a few months). I use it in combination with a keyboard tray with the top of the keyboard tilted down (the opposite of what you might think), to keep my hands in a neutral position."
3,Beware the small secondary keys,"I like the overall feel and you can't beat the price. But i didn't notice before purchasing that the Home/End/Delete and arrows keys are smaller than normal size. If i planned to use this as my primary keyboard, this makes things awkward enough that i'd return it and step up to the next model."
4,Love the keyboard,"My fingers are wide and they glide along this keyboard. I like the shape, helps with my arms and elbows when keying my invoices ect. Definately a buy!"
4,Pretty good keyboard,"This keyboard is pretty nice. The keys are relatively soft which is good for your hands. My only complaint is that the arrow keys are configured differently than most keyboards, which is taking me a bit to get used to."
3,Takes a big adjustment to get used to it,My wife really loves this keyboard and didn't have any problem adjusting to it. However I have used a normal keyboard all my life including every day at work and I found this keyboard really frustrating and could never really get used to it.
4,Good product,"My husband likes his new keyboard alot! He is a programer that is also a 2 finger typist. Since buying the Elite keyboard, he has started to type with all 10 fingers, and he doesn't have to look down. He also finds the wrist rest very comfortable."
5,pain free typing,Microsoft Natural Keyboard Elite is a must for anyone who touch types using a computer keyboard. The difference between a standard keyboard and the Natural Keyboard are night and day. I can type for hours using the Natural keyboard painfree; a few minutes using a standard keyboard and I'm in pain.
2,"Comfortable, but horrible layout","As a programmer, I can't stand that they changed the layout of the center row (ins, del, pgup, pgdn), slowing me down considerably, as well as the arrow keys (too small & awkward).NOT recommended if you have to switch between keyboards (at home/work)."
3,MS Natural Keyboard,"I'm a Natural Keyboard fan and like the placement of the keys. Typing is no problem, but the smaller sized Function and arrow keys make it difficult to quickly execute a command or navigate around the page. I prefer the keys on original MS Natural Keyboard."
2,"Felt good, failed quickly","To be blunt, it ""crapped out"" after 4 months and I don't do a lot of typing. I work on electronics for a living and I know how to care for and maintain devices so I tried to clean it. Nothing changed. It simply had several keys quit working. I had to go back to using the keyboard that came with my computer which is especially disappointing because I got used to the feel of the ergonomic keyboard and liked it."
3,Decent but keys get stuck.,The product arrived very quickly and over all I am somewhat pleased. It's obvious that the product is a bit old (purchased used) and the left shift key is very stiff and sometimes gets stuck which slows down my typing speed. I would have appreciated knowing that some keys get stuck as I would have purchased a different item. I didn't bother to return it as it's too much hassle.
1,LOUD so you know it's elite,"Compared to the other quiet keys (and nearly all keyboards), the space key (which is obviously used very frequently) is incredibly clacky. I've found this to be true on multiple MS natural 4000 keyboards in our IT dept. It's a design flaw, and makes the keyboard wholly unusable. I don't want to type on a typewriter all day, and that's what it sounds like."
5,I still love this!,"I purchased this keyboard when it first came out so many years ago. I have found either people love it or hate it. Usually this is determined in the first 15 mins of using it. I have been working in the field for 35 years and have gone through many versions of keyboards. This design has been the best for me. My wrists have greatly appreciated it.I truly miss the white (ish) colored devices. I do not know why everything is done in black these days. Old and tired eyes like mine find it much harder to use. I also prefer to use low lighting in my office. The lighter color is much easier to use. I wish they would bring that back like these. I have gone through about 4 of these keyboards over the years. I use it both at work and at home, and at my friends if I can talk them into it. Having also been an instructor I introduced many students to this keyboard. As mentioned either you love it or hate it."
2,Too Noisy,"I didn't purchase this keyboard, but worked purchased it for me.The key feed back is really loud on this computer. I tend to be a ""heavy"" typer so I prefer quieter keyboards so I'm not driving my coworkers crazy.The caps lock broke with in 2 months of using the keyboard. The base back is very ""hard"" and uncomfortable.I will say that the ""spacing"" was nice, as well as the key layout."
3,"Great Keyboard, With Some Faults","The Microsoft Natural line of keyboards are the best keyboards on the market, in my opinion.That said, there are a couple things about this keyboard that for me take it from a 5-star rating to a 3-star:The wrist-rest is plastic, and short. The plastic part is more offensive than the short length, in this case. It feels awful and cheap, but it's not a deal breaker.The arrow-directional keys are not in the standard position, or like they are on other Microsoft natural Keyboards, which is odd. This is done to make it a diminished footprint, I think. In any case, I don't like it.The Key Mapping is somewhat different from other Microsoft Natural keyboards, but it isn't a big deal.I dig the design-aesthetic of the black model a lot, in how it looks on my black glass desk.I use this as my back-up keyboard and as a keyboard for a second machine. For normal every day use as a primary keyboard I use and recommend theMicrosoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000."
4,Good positive keystrokes,"I use this keyboard at home and a conventional one at work. At first I found the conventional one tight after using this one for a bit. The key angle is good. I like the lights down the middle also.After 5 years or so of use, the keys respond as well as ever with good springback and never missing an action. The same model's been on sale that long in the UK, which actually says something about its popularity.The one drawback is the footprint of the feet is too narrow and its tricky to stop them from sliding. I've used ridged fabric, but a different shape and rubber on the feet would help a lot."
4,It's a keyboard,"Pros: sturdy board with good height adjustment; comfortable split that's not so dramatic to make changing from a standard keyboard difficult, but it has provided great relief on wrist stress; decent resistance in the keys (nothing too squishy); dual windows keys make it easier to continue using both left and right hand keyboard short cuts with a mac operating system (taking the place of the control key); non-skid feet on the front prevent the board from moving from a preferred position without a hard knock.Cons: altered position of the arrow keys and home/end/delete/page/insert keys took some getting used too; ""usb compatible"" is an adapter plug (found much cheaper than the keyboard), not a direct usb plug to the computer."
4,"Simple, Elegant, Functional - and being Discontinued!","I love this keyboard. I've been using one for years, and have one at my office. I recently bought a new one for home after many, many years of faithful service -- a pot of spilled salt water (don't ask) on the old keyboard finally did it in. I highly recommend this product -- my wrists don't ache anymore when I type for long periods!"
2,Lacks,"This keyboard is a decent ergonomic, but I would expect better for this price. Especially from Microsoft. It is nice that the feet to angle the keyboard are in the back as opposed to the front like many ergonomic keyboards. It is more comfortable that way. However, like many others have noted, the key layout of the arrow keys, the 6 keys above them, and the function keys (F1 - F12) are not the standard size/shape. This slows me down considerably. Also, the wrist rest is not removable or replacable. Overall Microsoft could have done a LOT better. Major thumbs down."
5,great keyboard,Wish they would continue to make other keyboards with the 1-2-1 arrow pattern like this keyboard does. Its simple to use.
1,Worst purchase ever,"The keyboard is quiet and keeps my wrist in a good position when it works. Keys: T,R,F,G,V stopped working after four months. I don't eat at my desk, so there wasn't anything to clean when I took the keyboard apart. Stay away from this product."
2,Microsoft Keyboard,"I have been using Microsoft ergonomic keyboards all the time. This one has got a little jinx in it. I wonder why are the arrow keys are placed so. The up and down keys are not placed back to back, but up and down arrows are placed back to back. This causes a lot problem while using the arrow keys. They should have followed the normal standards."
1,The worst of all Microsoft keyboards,"The Elite's key layout is non-standard: the Ins/Home/Pgup and Del/End/PgDn key grouping is rotated through 90 degrees. This means that you have to re-learn your right hand typing behaviour. To make matters worse the reduced-size cursor keys are not in the usual inverted T, but in a cruciform arrangement, which makes this keyboard pretty useless for people who engage in FPS games like Quake 2/3, Unreal etc. They're really only fit for people with fingers like pencils.On the whole, the Elite keyboard is only for those who suffer from restricted space (such as those who use pull-out keyboard trays), but MUST have a natural layout."
1,Frustrating,"This keyboard has had a mind of its own since it got here. When you first open a document or a blank email, sometimes a random key takes off. It can be a hundred 2's in a row or it can be stuck on ESC or it might be the ENTER button. If you're lucky, the ESC button will stop the insanity. I have had the keyboard for 6 months because I hate shopping for them and I'm too cheap to buy a new one since I know how to make this one behave, but now it's starting to just quit working for no reason. I got one with a wire so it wouldn't have to have batteries, but now I'm having the same problem as if I had batteries that were dying. Waste of good money."
2,"Keeps wrist straight, VERY SOFT KEYS","I was given one of these at work. WHile it does keep your wrists straight, the keys are EXTREMELY SOFT TOUCH. Words often blur togheter and I have to spend extra time correcting them bevcause of this soft touch --- especially the most important one - the SPACE bar is so soft. I would never buy one on my own. Not sure I am going to keep it; may just turn it back in."
1,Totally Worthless Rubbish!,"This kit contains 2 tubes of weak rubber cement and an assortment of patches. I tried to use it to patch a bike tube but it won't hold. The patches are think and chunky with square edges, not tapered. I tried gluing one on the tube to patch a hole but it wouldn't stay. The patches are so thick I don't think you could get the tube in without knocking them off but it didn't get that far. I glued one on with the supplied rubber cement and put weights on it to hold it flat until the glue dried but later the corners of the patch were starting to curl up and I found that I could easily pull it off with my fingers so there's no way it would hold against the pressure of inflating the tube. These patches might work to fix a puncture if applied to the inside of a car tire but they won't work at all on a tube. I don't know how a company can get away with selling something so worthless, they should all be recalled!"
1,144 seeded/ approx 36 plants - see seed reviews!,Unbelievable expense when adding in green house expenses for such a poor yield. Very disappointed in the way all has gone so far ........
5,I Love These Starter Discs,"First, I purchased the 100 pack...actually got 3 more than that. My seeds started great except for one type of tomato and pepper which later I read about. I love these things. I love that there are no pots to empty and clean and that these can go right in the ground. I will continue using them as I have for years. Nice to get them through Amazon."
3,Did the Job,"I am not a gardener, but found these to be sort of annoying to use. I was going to buy peat pots, but thought these would be easier to use since they are all in one things. After I hydrated them, they grew to the desired size. It took a bit longer than expected, but not a huge deal. They are covered in a netting to hold them together (it's really tiny and not noticeable, it can be planted and I had to poke my finger through each one to make a hole for the seeds. I also had trouble getting the seeds to stay in. The bigger ones kept popping out. They have all sprouted now, and look good. I think they will be very easy to transfer into my garden, just not quite as easy to use as I had thought they would be. I will probably use them again next year."
5,Best Seed Starter Around,"I have been starting seeds indoors for years. The Jiffy Peat Soil Pellet starting plugs have got to be the best invention ever. All you do is soak the pellets until they swell and then pull back the netting slightly and insert your seed. I have had the best results with these little miracles then any other method around. Just let your seeds grown in these until you are ready to plant, it's as if you bought a six pack from the nursery for only pennies instead of dollars."
4,check this size,bah - i didnt check the size on these before i ordered. they are a bit bigger than the ones the i get to refill the seed growing container i purchased at the store. i had to take out the bottom tray of the container and set these up freestanding. they work just as well though and have plenty of room for seeds.
5,Love Pat Boone!,"These are the most popular hymns I can recall as a child. So inspirational, so calming and just plain what this world needs! Spread the faith and the love."
1,wth,this is obviously a fake the product pictured is no transformer it's a veratech fighter jet from the macross serries
3,about one disc's worth of good stuff,"It was a great idea putting Rod's early solo stuff alongside Faces on a 2-disc anthology... they just didn't do a very good job selecting the songs. You'd be better off with one of Rod's myriad Mercury compilations and Rhino's terrific _Best of Faces_.And if the ""top 500"" reviewer below was as smart as his rating, he'd have realized that most of the bum cuts on here are Rod solo, sans Faces (mainly from the slightly overrated _Never a Dull Moment_ and the god-awful _Smiler_)."
2,Dog,"There are far superior compilations of both Rod Stewart's Mercury recordings and of his Faces recordings. Indeed, a Faces compilation and a Mercury compilation are essential. This is poorly thrown together and serves no purpose."
3,A solid book on consulting services management,"Comprehensive in style yet featuring very to-the-point content, this once was my favourite book about consulting management. Today, I prefer more practical management consulting writers such as Alan Weiss."
3,italy and italian,"A very basic book suitable for 3-6 year olds, with color pictures, some language, and basic demographic info. in an easy to digest format. Some how, I expected more detail. The book did not hold my 6 year old's interest for more than a couple of minutes."
2,Getting to Know Italy and Italian,I bought this book to read to my 7 and 8 year old grand children....I thought it was way too advanced
4,book on Italy,this is to fulfill a wish list for a Salvation army tree tag boy.I hope this is ok for the 6 year old.Lots of pictures anyway
2,Not what I expected,I got this DVD for Christmas and I was really disappointed with it. There are other DVD's which cover the beginnings of the band much better than this one and I would not recommend it. I was hoping it would have more clips of the band and some never seen footage from the earlier days.
3,"If you collect indie labels, and don't own this...wassup??","If close to 50% of a compilation disk makes it to one of my mix tapes, it's a winner. This CD will always stay in my collection. Winners are the tracks by Monkey 101, V-3, Sebadoh, and GbV (some of the others are starting to grow on me). The only drawback is that I wish the CD had more in terms of liner notes and artist info. You won't find these songs anywhere else."
4,Disney's Haunted Mansion,"Having been to Disneyland this past year, I really wanted something to keep that would help us to relive our journey to the States. The Haunted Mansion was one of our favourite rides, and the book is full of amazing photos and descriptions of how the ride came to be and the production that went into the rides and movie. If you are looking for an inside peek at The Haunted Mansion, that is also a beautiful book to treasure, I believe that this is a great investment."
5,Great information I didn't know!,"I loved this book! Having suffered with a chronic illness (now completely well), I thought I knew it all about natural health...but Gina's book really did give me some new things to think about and pursue to maintain my health. It's really easy to read and organized well. I highly recommended it as a well-rounded guide on keeping yourself well!"
1,More information on the book,"Being a systems analyst, I feel this is one of the books I should read. But I'd like to be very sure. Could you provide me with a facsimile of the 'Table of Contents' of the book so I can decide whether I should buy the book after all. Thanks."
5,Patty Reed's Doll,Patty Reed's Doll is an excellent account of the Donner Party and all the other families that were part of the Donner Tragedy.The book describes the families in such detail you feel like you're traveling with them. The Reeds are one of the families that are traveling with the Donner Party. The story is an excellent way to teach elementary school children as well as adults what trailblazing was really like and the severe hardships that went with it. As an elementary school teacher I highly recommend this book. It is an asset to studying California history.
5,No 4th Grade Class should be without,This is a beautifully written book that captures the plight of pioneers traveling west. My fourth grade students really gain a sense of what life was like once upon a time. Great book!!...
5,Excellent murder mystery!,"Wow what a great book! Keeps you guessing on who did it right until the very end, and then you still don't know. Can't wait until your next book comes out Beverly!"
5,Great suspense,"""Righteous Revenge"" first novel by Beverly J Scott will have you on the edge of your seat and keep you engrossed. This is a read-in-one-sitting well-written mystery. There is just enough romance mixed into the plot to entertain most readers. Marvelous first novel."
2,Big let down,"I am a big fan of Michel Thomas' German series (both the basic and the advanced courses.) With those courses you very quickly learn basic and intermediate sentence structure as well as a decent amount of basic vocabulary. However, this course lacks any such direction or structure. It is essentially Michel reading out items such as, ""January is Januar, February is Februar..."" Unlike the first two courses there is no obvious places to pause and come up with sentences on your own. In fact, he really doesn't ask you to. I just didn't know what to do with this course. There were a few nuggets of information in it, so it isn't 1 star, but I wouldn't recommend it."
3,a bit on the small side...,"From the discription I read I thought the plant would a bit bigger. The plant is just barely past being a seedling, the discription said it would be a well established plant in a 3"" pot. Well, yes, it was in a pot & it does have leaves & a root system but it is maybe a 1/4 tall. I don't think that is the ""norm."", at least I hope not, not for $9.99... hind sight being 20/20 I should have looked more on the web & gotten the 1 gallon potted plant from another seller for the same price.Pros: Plant was shipped very nicely with lots of the styrfoam peanuts.Cons: Much smaller than expected, picture are deceiving, you are definitely not receiving a mature plant. (Nice to know what the plant might look like in a year or two.)"
3,Not like the picture,"While the plant that arrived was healthy and robust, it doesn't look anything like the picture or the description. The older leaves are mottled with white and shades of olive green. Pretty. However, the reason I bought the plant was because of the picture with the new leaves a pure pink, then changing to white and on to the dappled color. The VERY young leaves have pink, but it's more of a pink hue over the mottled color on the mature leaves. I has hoping for more of a dramatic difference between the young and new leaves. I'll keep the plant, but I'll be hesitant before buying a plant online that I'm purchasing solely for decorative purposes."
3,A new divide,"As a record, this is pretty good. It features all the classic Dead C 'hooks' we had come to know and love: cardboard box guitar sounds, murky underwater vocals, drear and heavy mood evocations. But it also features some of the techniques that it turned out would characterise the Dead C's subsequent releases: finally, the experimentalism of HoD and Gate infiltrates the Dead C, giving rise to the epic 'Outside' and 'The New Snow'. Seen in the light of the similarly packaged 'Repent', an astonishing tour-de-force of mprov noise-rock, we can see this album as more significantly a transition point for the Dead C. A transition between records filled with tracks like 'Your Hand' and 'bitcher' (the most pop moment here), to 'Repent' and 'Tusk'. Which is not to say it isn't good in itself. Just that it is a little confused about what it is doing as a record."
5,Two seems to be a good starting age for this toy.,"My son was four months old when I purchased this toy and only enjoyed hearing me play it for him. He didn't really start to take an interest in it until he was two when figuring out how to turn the knob in the correct direction. He is also more fascinated in the inner workings when he does it himself. I hold my breath every time he drops it, but so far it has held up well. He plays with it all the time and any buyer's remorse I had initially is gone now."
4,Great book for the collector or highway traveler,"Taking a road trip? This book is a terrific take along for those games of license plate spotting, showing all the variations of license plates for all 50 states. Perfect for solving the inevitable arguments that occur when someone claims that a car from Hawaii just passed on the New Jersey Turnpike. (If it hasn't happened to you, then you've never taken a road trip in your life or you're an only child and I pity you!)If you're a license plate collector, this isn't the most in depth book available, but it has wonderful color photographs and appears to be quite up-to-date. You'll be amazed at how many different plates are in circulation, and the variety of artistic interpretations of these everyday, often overlooked objects.Either way, it's well worth buying and tucking into the glove compartment."
2,Disappointed.,"Owning the 2002 edition of this title, I was very disappointed in the overall presentation of the book. Yes the book does include up to date illustrations of plates, but these are much smaller. Additional pages of info for example at the front of the book have been dropped. The quality of the paper used is also inferior."
4,"Nice earrings, took 4 days, smaller than expected, cheap gift bag","I'm a first time buyer of jewelry online, and overall I was satisfied. I will probably buy online again.The earrings were smaller than expected from the picture, but still a nice size.The free gift bag was cheap and I didn't use it. You get what you pay for.I paid the expedite fee to speed up the shipping, but it still took close to a week. I will keep that in mind next time."
3,bueno para aficionados,"Al comprar este libro pensé que sería más serio, más profesional. Tiene lindas fotos, pero la información técnica sobre, por ejemplo, variedades de rosas en el mundo, no está actualizada, es bastante antigua. Además los tópicos de landscaping alcanzan apenas para señoras aficionadas a su jardín, no más que eso. Es lindo, pero liviano."
5,Powerful. Dynamic.,"I agree 100% with Iron Arrow's review. And I probably can't expand on it in any useful way except to say I love it and I let it blare over and over every day since I got it. But of course I will try anyway.Each instrument (including the vocals), if you were to pick them out individually, is very dynamic alone. And somehow together they do not clash, they enhance and compliment... the writing and arrangement is near masterful in my eyes. The lyrics are delivered with such a range of emotion its insane. Fiery and chilling and touching (to name a couple). What makes this album so important to me is the simple fact that I can feel how personal and important it is to the artist. It inspires emotion in me, the listener. That's my definition of true art. Great!"
1,they're going to throw salt right into your bloody ears,"I'd watch out, because they're going to throw salt right into your bloody ears with their whiney, out of tune vocals and haphazard instrumentation. Almost had me with the heavy riffs, but the mix is just so all over the place."
4,The first book to read on Japanese Nationalism,"There have been many books on nationalism in Japan, but Yoshino's one is the first one which fully incorporate the theories of nationalism which have developed in Anglo-Saxon (mostly LSE) academia. Really well done.However, it remains unclear which type of nationalism the ongoing debate in Japan on the re-interpretation of histry falls into. Even after the nation fully develops itself, re-affirmation and reconstruction of the meaning of the nation never ends. His typology needs some modification.This book is nonetheless a breakthrough in the field of nations and nationalism and strongly recommended."
5,"Good product, solves the problem","Our rural area has crummy and unreliable power delivery. My guitar amp would sometimes go up and down in volume on its own. This power ""conditioner"" seems to clean things up well and make my amp sound even better."
4,"""Built Like A Tank""","The phrase ""Built Like A Tank"" is used too often.While I haven't seen this attempt to curtail a lightening strike, the build quality of this unit is what I'd expect out of Furman and then some.it's large, metal, and heavy. While some manufacturers (Monster Cable, in particular) will claim plastic multi-outlet strips are surge protection, I have much more faith in Furman -- which is a pretty reliable brand in protecting pro-audio rack gear as well."
4,"Works well, if not perfect","I have a Fender Vibrolux/Reverb amp powered from this power unit. I had hoped it would be able to eliminate the ground hum I hear sometimes using the reverb on the amp. So, I will have to look for another solution to the issue as this unit didn't really fix it. But, it works well and is an asset."
4,Great Natural History,I had this book lying around for some time and finally picked it. It was an easy read and highly enjoyable. Anyone who enjoys natural history writing with plenty of science thrown in will surely enjoy Bernd Heinrich. I have several more Heinrich books waiting in the wings and can't wait to get to them.
4,Educational and entertaining.,"Kept me interested throughout satisfying my curiosity regarding the ways in which animals, and some insects, survive the extremes of winter. Mr. Heinrich spends a little more time on Kinglets than other species as they are obviously his favorites. However, there's sufficient variety of information in Winter World to satisfy most everyone."
3,Nature doesn't answer to science.,"Heinrich would better serve Nature and his spirit if he were a naturalist, rather than a scientist. His methods of collecting information are, at times, destructive.Killing life as a means of obtaining knowledge about the individual shows impatience and proves laziness.Also, I find that studying ""wild"" animals in a lab environment is, not only, unreliable, but also inhumane. Information gathered as such, should be disregarded, for animals removed from their natural environments, and subjected to captivity by their predators (i.e. humans) have noticeable changes in their behavior. Any and all conclusions cannot be relied upon.Aside from those two notable nuisances, the book was a good read and very well authored."
4,Where are all the animals in winter?,"I picked up this book because, living in the northeast, I wondered what happened to all of the animals in wintertime. Which ones hibernate? Which ones migrate? Which ones die? And I wasn't disappointed. Heinrich provides ample explanations, in understandable language, of what happens to squirrels, birds, insects, turtles, trees, and others (although there isn't much about fish). He is also a fantastic nature writer, weaving simple but elegant stories in and out of the science, stories mostly set in his two main observation sites, Vermont and Maine. And the overriding theme of the whole book is the battle of animals to regulate their temperatures and metabolisms to avoid freezing, in the harsh food conditions of winter. This is good introductory reading for anyone with questions about winter survival."
2,broke as soom as I opened the package,I was very pleased with how quickly this product arrived (next day). But not at all pleased with how it fell apart the second I opened the package. I got out a screw driver and tried to get the screws back in but they were a little too sort to work properly. It is being held together with tape right now. It does work though. I suppose that's what I get for buying the cheap one.
3,Functional,"This item resets with the knob on the side and advances with the button on the top. This is fine, but not what I was hoping for. All things considered though, I still found a good use for it and am pleased with its performance."
5,Greatest western Christmas music,This is Classic Christmas collection of western songs by Michael Martin Murphey. If I were to own one set of Christmas music this would be it.It is the wonderful old time music sung by one of the finest cowboy singers in the U S>
4,This one is hard not to like!,"Odd Man Out is an excellent blend of suspense and political intrigue. Robert Sutter takes this successful mix and adds historically accurate and realistic military jargon and situations. Sutter deftly incorporates ""fast forwarding/rewinding"" time techniques that reels in and interests the reader, but never loses him. One of the few recent books that I've read that was hard to put down. Don't be surprised to see an adaptation of this on the big screen in the future."
5,A wonderful CDs holder,I have to say that the quality of this holder is great and it looks nice. I am so happy for buying it.
5,Great CD storage,"This CD Holder is perfect for keeping 30 CD's in a clear unit. Package says you can stack them but I probably wouldn't do that unless it was stored against a solid wall or something. It does have nice sticky feet so it won't move easily, but the height of two together might be too much. There is a small ""catch"" at the back so they won't slide on through and the two top slots would hold a 2 disc CD just fine. This is an excellent low cost storage unit that works well."
5,Holds DVD's and XBOX 360 games perfectly,"Ordered 2 to fit inside my media cabinet, fit perfectly. Received before the estimated ship date, very pleased overall"
2,Received damaged items twice...,"The product itself if just as described and worked perfectly. The lower rating was given because of the condition the product was in when delivered. I ordered 3 of these and had to return one because it was badly cracked. I ordered a replacement CD Holder to replace the damaged one and 1 additional holder as well. When those 2 items were delivered, one was fine, the other cracked. I managed to glue the cracked one together so it is usable but, whether the problem is in the packaging (doubtful, since the boxes were not damaged in any way) or simply poor quality control (broken items are packed and shipped out to customers), I will not be purchasing any more of these."
2,couldn't find what I wanted,"Does anyone know where I can find a similar CD Holder that has a larger capacity? I have two Laserline CD Holders that store 90 CD's, and would buy another one, but I think that company went out of business. This CD Holder is okay, but it only holds 30 CD's. I would have to stack them several levels high to equal the capacity of my Laserline CD Holders. This could be unstable! I miss the old days, when album cover art was on a 12"" square piece of cardboard. What do people who store their CD's in high-capacity envelope-style containers, without the individual CD containers, do with their (smaller) album cover art? Throw it in the garbage??!!"
5,Stackable CD Holder,"I ordered a number of these and have been very happy with their ""performance"" -- they are solid and don't collapse as some I've had in the past did. If I needed more CD holders, I would order more of these for sure! And the supplier was prompt, also."
4,A side note,"It should be noted that these cases will hold 30 CDs but there are two slots for double CDs at the top of each case. I have not seen a double CD case in a long time, with the advent of the 2CD standard sized case. It is too bad there are not 30 individual CD slots. However, the cases are sturdy and they were well packaged when shipped."
5,Great service & product. I have ordered another one already.,This product is just what I was looking for. It is compact and fits on the shelf in my cabinet. Since it is so perfect...I have ordered another.The service was prompt and the product arrived in perfect condition.I would recomment this product and seller without hesitation.
5,"Great Price, Great TV","This TV has excelenet picture for the price. It has better picture quality than my friends Sony 32"" TV. Your better off to buy this TV than to spend the extra money for a sony, etc. They may have a little better technical specs, but nothing that the human eye can tell the difference on."
4,SwingSetter by David Leadbetter,"I have been using this swing training device for about a year now and have definitely improved the accuracy of my golf shots. It helps develop a good rhythm, or tempo, and the correct swing plane. Mr. Leadbetter emphasizes the proper grip and that has definitely improved the accuracy of my shots. The instructionsl DVD that accompanies the device is excellent. It give a thorough development of all the elements of a proper golf swing. I highly recommend this device."
4,a fine effort,"Yo La Tengo's Painful CD is reminiscent of a slightly more rocking, slightly more mainstream effort by Sonic Youth, tempered with a lot of Velvet Underground.When this album is quiet, it's intense. And when this album is loud, it's intense too. And YLT never lose their creepy sense of humor.Among the last several Yo La Tengo albums, I like this one the best. This album features better songwriting than any of the early Yo La Tengo albums, and ranks with I Can Hear the Heart Beating As One among YLT's best.I especially like the second version of the song Big Day Coming, which is more of a rocker than the first version. Isn't that a good title for a song? Two versions of this song are included on the album. One is quiet and short, the other is longer and loud and the guitars are more loud and distorted.Yo La Tengo fans won't go wrong by purchasing this. I think it also serves as a good introduction to the band."
5,Painless on the ears,"As far as Painful's place in Yo La Tengo's entire work goes - it is a great example of an earlier album that points to the direction they are currently heading. With an electric edge, enhanced by the perfect amount of feedback and distortion Painful represents a departure from previous indie-pop/rock albums. On this album vocals, take a back seat to the music. Yo La Tengo's Painful has a great flow from start to end. It begins with the slower of two versions of Big Day Coming to ease the listener into the album. It quickly picks up speed into Double Dare followed by a teary-eyed Nowhere Near. The album's mood continues to change until it hits the rougher, but equally great, version of Big Day Coming. Finishing off the work (fitting in almost as if a hidden track), I Heard You Looking leaves the listening wondering where they just spent the last hour."
4,Exquisite sonic ear candy,"This is my favorite YLT album. It contains everything I like about this band: loud but intelligent tunesmithing married with Georgia's exquisite voice in ""Nowhere Near"", possibly the band's finest moment and certainly the most beautiful song they've ever recorded.Wonderful and highly recommended."
4,Yo la tengo best,"I'm not into Yo la Tengo music so much that i'd own all their records. No, that I think they're bad or something. No, i really think their work is very good, and as people i think they are one of the coolest people around in music biz. But they use and recreate some formulas that doesn't touch my innerself and i need that in music. This record does it. That's why i have is this one that i think it their crown jewel. Their Velvet-SonicYouth influences are here but they went ahead of them - they created their own home coziness, typical Yo la Tengo coolness that they make in all their albums but unfornatelly only on a couple of songs, here is the whole album."
3,Reluctantly . . only 3 stars,"I love this band, but am ambivalent about this recording. I was influenced by the raves and grabbed it this past weekend. Maybe it will grow on me - many great albums with depth/complexity often need repeated listens - but I'm a little disappointed early on. Not as melodic as ""I can Hear"" and meanders a bit toward the end.We'll see . ."
3,Not what I expected,"Our marriage counselor recommended a book like this and after finding it on Amazon it seemed like a good choice. I did not recognize the author's name and it seemed like a good place to start, so I purchased it.Once I received the book and started perusing it, it became clear that it is a religious book, written from a christian perspective for christian couples. Had I known that I would have picked another, more ""secular"" book. In hindsight I guess I should have researched the author.If you're looking for something with a religious twist, then this one is for you. If not, then you'd be better off picking another, similar book. I only wish I had known this - because I now have zero use for this book.Hope this helps someone!"
2,dumb questions,"we found the questions to be silly or not applicable to us, and we can't think of any friends we would recommend it to.THe book was also a waste of space because it is one question per page, and they could have fit all of the questions into a booklet less than a few pages."
2,Picture misleading,When I ordered the topper I thought that the product would include everything in the picture. In truth it is just Woody himself that is the topper. I will still be able to use it but am very disappointed by the misleading picture. Will have to completely replan my daughters birthday cake!
4,Children the Challenge,"Even though this book was first published in 1964, it is still an excellent book to help parents, care givers, or anyone who deals with children an insight on how to better deal with children. Putting the advice into practice IS the challenge. It does work though."
2,I don't really care for this book,"This book contains some good advice, but isn't full of it. I was actually hanging my mouth open during some chapters and the suggestions that were given. I feel that the material is a bit dated. However, if you have a problem child (which I do not) you may find some of the advice in this book much more helpful than I did. There a pros and cons to this book. For me, the cons outweighed the pros."
5,a book every parent should read,"I am not going to type a dissertation on why this book is great. My wife and I have both read this and find many of the techniques and themes presented to be accurate and useful. Using this book as a method for finding new ways to approach problems instead of how to get your child to do or not to do something will make this book useful. While it was written for a previous generation, humans are still humans and they are motivated and inspired in similar ways.If you want to take the high road for a better life and care about spending quality time with your children, this is a great addition to your parenting library."
5,Best child rearing book around,I read this years ago and it saved my sanity. Just bought this for my daughter to help her save her sanity. A poroctical guide to child rearing with examples you have or eill experience and solutions. I only wish I had read this 10 years earier than I did. I'd be drug free!
5,Red Rose For Gregory,"Ohh Lord, Gregory Isaacs is sooo romantic. He has such a velvety, rich, smoothe, swoon-worthy voice. Listening to his music and his VOICE is like a warm tropical breeze gently blowing through your hair while you're relaxing in a hammock suspended by two palm trees...."
5,A great resource for those using the PASS theory,"This is a great collection of neuropsychoeducational handouts for those using the PASS theory, or using cognitive strategies for helping children how to use the underlying cognitive processes of learning. A must for school, educational, cognitive psychologists and pediatric neuropsychologists. If you are looking forward to use this practical strategies and you are not familiarized with PASS theory or Luria's works, please review them first. Thanks, J.P.Das, J. Naglieri and Pickering for theses materials."
4,Helping Children Learn: Intervention Handouts for Use in School and Home,A very practical useable book. It is well structured and easy to access information from. It is a handy desk reference for some common and not so common conditions.
4,Pretty handy,"I put this out and rotate my latest most-played CD's... it's handy the way CD's flip, makes browsing easy ... in hindsight it seems a bit overpriced with shipping, like it should be $10 on the store shelf.. but I haven't seen one on the shelf"
5,What You See Is What You Get,This holder wasn't exactly what I thought it was but when I got it and put my CD's in it I found it to actually be better then expected. Don't hesitate to order if if you need a cool CD holder.
4,Cool CD racks,"I bought this CD rack for use in my car. I was looking for something that I can organize my CDs in a rack so that I can view the titles from top and pick them. This works greatly. I have been using this for the last one month and it seems durable and reasonably priced. I have not compared this with other racks available in the market and hence I have given four stars for this product.1.Stackable 40-CD Storage Rack - Bamboo (Bamboo) 17.5"" x 6.5"" x 5.5""2.Acrylic Stackble 12 CDs Holder3.Acrylic Stackble 30 CDs Holder"
4,"Excellent Material, incomplete edition","Seneca reads like a modern, though he is wiser than us. He knows his weaknesses, and ours. Rather than complain about them, he gives us methods for dealing with them, for living as a human being. When I feel I've lost my way, I reopen Seneca and reabsorb the lessons. His knowledge is something that must be read many times, until it becomes an unthinking part of your character.I would prefer a complete edition, however. I like many of Penguin's books, but in this one they've only included a portion of Seneca's letters. I will eventually buy a complete version. Fortunately, since these are meant to be reread, I've in no way lost for having read some in advance."
4,An excellent translation,The letters in this book are full of nuggets of wisdom and quotable passages. Seneca isn't my favorite Stoic philosopher but this book is one of the easiest to read translations of an ancient text I have ever come across. It was worth adding to me library.
4,A very important author,"Seneca was probably not the most original thinker of the Stoic school. His writing style was also not the most agreeable to many. However, Seneca has had a profound influence on many, many later writers. Pliny the Younger, St. Augustine, and Ralph Waldo Emerson all quote, and borrow from Seneca. With Marcus Aurelius, Seneca is one of the most accessible of the Stoics. He is also an invaluable source of information about Stoicism's rivals, Epicurus and his followers. This particular volume is also filled with very helpful notes, and it is a good place to start a journey with the stoics."
3,Good info. Hard to read.,"This is hard to rate because the book is loaded with valuable insights. There are several quotes that will apply to your life today.That said, it was very hard to read. It is boring beyond belief. It took me months to get through it because I could only take a few pages at a time before my mind wondered off.I don't think I got all there is to get from it in one read. This is more of a book that needs to be studied. Perhaps leave is laying on the coffee table and read a page or two a day with a high lighter.I will probably read it many times over to let all the wisdom sink in, but this same information could be easily condensed into another book with fewer words, and better editing to appeal to modern day readers."
4,Very sweet,This is a great read and a great little book about a dog we probably all owned at one time. I enjoyed it tremendously.
4,A story that will grab the heart of animal lovers.,"The story of the enchanting and amazing dog Ginny, and her caring, giving rescuer and author Philip Gonzalez.I loved the first half of the book, describing the bonding of Philip and Ginny, the stories of all the disabled cats adorable Ginny rescues, and animal advocate Philip provides a home for. It's a truly warm, feel-good story.Hats off to people as passionate and giving as Mr. Gonzalez!My only problem with the book is that even though it's short at 160 pages, I got tired of reading about the series of cat rescues after awhile...it began to feel repetitious, as fascinating as it was for the first half of the book."
4,heart warming,"This is a lovely story, written simply but with a lot of character. I like how Phillip is so straightforward about everything; he doesn't whine and beg for sympathy about his situation before finding salvation; he just tells it as it is - a fact of life."
5,Wonderful Book,"This book is amazing and heartwarming. I highly recommend the story of Ginny and her person, Philip to anyone who loves dogs or cats or both."
3,Have to listen to it more,"I have almost all of her discography but this one just didn't click with me. It's pretty depressing, yet presented in a cohesive manner/program. I seem to enjoy ""MALEDICTION AND PRAYER"", ""LA SERPENTA CANTA"" and ""THE SINGER"" more so than any of her other works with the exception of ""THE LATANIES OF SATAN"" and ""ARTEMIS"" and ""DOUBLE BARREL PRAYER"" respectively from ""SAINT OF THE PIT"" and ""WHEN I WAKE UP I SEE THE FACE OF THE DEVIL."" Like I stated in my title, I have to give multiple listenings to fully digest and appreciate it. However, I do appreciate and acknowledge Diamanda's ambition and devotion to this subject matter of the Armenian and anotolian Greek genocides.Juliusl-Allan H.Chicago,Il."
5,Much better,"I was a little disappointed with ""Red Sky at Morning,"" but this book returned Good to my list of favorite authors. I only had 2 problems with the book.1) The scene where Kerry is talking with her group at he church is found in both ""Red Sky..."" and this book. It makes more sense in ""Thicker Than Water,"" so it should have been removed from ""Sky.""2) I think Kyle got off WAY too easy. I would have loved to have seen him get what he deserved."
4,Very Good!,"I have read a lot of reviews of this workout being monotonous but I find it very satisfying. High reps bring great results, no matter how boring they might be. Very athletic and easy to follow which I love. And Greg is pretty funny. It works your core as it says it will and the cardio is high impact but keeps your heart rate elevated. There are a few segments with the band I skip and do my own exercise because I find it a bit confusing, and don't really feel it the next day. But then he says ""if you are not feeling it, you probably aren't doing it right"" and this could definately be true. LOL"
4,Exciting book.,A very good book especially that it was taken place in Cozumel. My family went on vacation there in January.
4,Loved this book.,"Love Nora Roberts anyway, but this book was exceptional. I couldn't put it down, read it in three days. Wonderful!"
4,Good Story,Enjoyed these characters and the story. I actually didn't suspect the real bad guy...I like being surprised and I'm not often am.
4,Great Read,"Nora showed her talent again in being able to keep the characters intriguing and true to themselves. Some have posted they wish it had been updated, but I think it's just perfect the way it is. I very rarely give 5 stars which is the only reason it gets only 4. :-)"
3,Risky Business,I read this book one week ago and cannot remember the plot so I would say it was enjoyable at the time but not memorable.
3,Fun,A thrilling twist with a lots of romance. Coronal sounds like a beautiful and romantic place to visit. A place for true love.
2,A. Good read.,"I have been reading Nora Roberts books for many years, and have never been disappointed. This one was another good read. Thrilling and romantic."
4,Risky Business,"Great book, a little different then her usual story type, found it very entertaining. Look forward to more like it/"
3,"Good, but not good enough to keep me reading through the night.",I picked this book because I have always enjoyed Nora R's books. I will continue to buy and read them.
4,Nora Roberts typical mystery book.,I have read several of Roberts books. Always the same theme strong women but vulnerable. Okay read for a cold or rainy day.
3,Risky Business was just OK.,"This book was definitely just ok. Not boring and kept me reading but I had a hard time getting past some major character flaws. The fact that Jonas smoked seemed odd -- gave it that hokey "" who done it"" feel. Worse though was Liz choosing her love of career over her own child. Even though the author explains her reason for living in Mexico and leaving her daughter in the States with her grandparents -- it was a poor reason. I mean who gives up watching their child grow everyday because she's a tough business women. I am so sick of the overdone ""I am woman -- hear me roar"" theme.Lastly I wish the drug smuggling thing could have been at least partially convincing. It was so bad. The characters were very weak. Overall I have read way worse but I'm good on Nora's books for awhile."
3,Predictable but enjoyable,"Moved fast..completely predictable....but a good read,just not as exciting or mysterious as other Nora Roberts books..I would recommend for a lazy afternoon"
4,Risky business,Another Nora Roberts suspense/romance novel. I've never been disappointed in her work. A couple of good twists to the story.
4,As always,AnythIng by one of my favorite writers. Been reading her books for years. Got this one free. Still a great way to spend a n afternoon.
5,Great ebook for reading.,I love Nora Roberts books and really like the ability to read them on my ipad. Great book and reading!!
3,Nice mystery,I liked the mystery part but didn't like the sexual passages. I skipped over them. I will be aware of this if I get any more of the author's books.
4,Risky Business,"A fast moving story holding my attention from start to finish.Thoroughly enjoyable. Just enough intrigue and a happy ending. For an enjoyable escape from daily routine, Nora Roberts books are the best."
4,Unusual and well developed plot,"Plot holds your attention. Characters come to life, you feel you know them. Good read. I recommend Riskey Businessby Nora Roberts"
3,Interesting,A typical Nora Roberts novel. Some interest in a new story line viz diving. Do not enjoy explicit sex scenes
5,Nora Roberts best author ever,I love Nora Roberts books.this one was as good as I expected it to be. She never disappoints.the characters were very real and appealing
4,Risky Business,Nora Roberts is a very good suspense story teller and I enjoy everything that I have read of her books.
4,NIce reading,"If you just want a good story without a lot of drama, this will keep you relaxed and entertained. Fun."
4,book by nora roberts,"I had read it before, its a very good book. I read a lot of Nora Roberts. And will read more."
3,Risky Business,"I have just started reading this book, but it is good so far. I haven't read the others yet, just building my library. Love my Kindle."
3,Just something to read,"Bought for my wife on her Kindle as she reads 2-3 books a week. She likes enough to buy more @1.99, but not worth more."
2,Risky Business,"If you like Robert's writing, you'll like ""Risky Business."" I am sorry I was taken in by the the book description. Soft porn isn't my thing."
3,Typical Nora Roberts,If you like Nora Roberts you'll like this one. Her writing is crisp leading to a fast read. I would get another.
2,Dated and boring,"I chose this because it was by Nora Roberts, who sometimes writes entertaining novels. However, this book felt like an amateur's version of the last book I read by her. Then I saw it was written sometime in the mid '90's, so maybe she was still honing her craft. I would have appreciated knowing up front it was a re-print or whatever it was because it was a waste of time and money. I give it 2 stars for being written by a woman who can really do good stuff sometimes."
3,Re-release that is a bit dated.,"This was not a bad romance except that it was a bit dated. Lots of smoking and no cell phones, maybe a few other things also that made you think what the heck was going on. I liked the story and the romance was good, being a re-release I wish Nora had edited the story a bit to being it into the current decade, I believe it would have been better received and enjoyed by a wide audience. The story was good and I love a sweet romance that doesn't take long to read, I'm a sucker for the Happily Ever After ending."
3,Just okay,"I am a big fan of Nora Roberts books, and I wasn't crazy about this one. Mainly because I didn't find the romance very believable. The chemistry was wrong, and the transition from rival to all of a sudden attraction and interest and love was not smooth and believable. The book was easy to read, but not fun like Nora Robert's usual. I usually devour her books. My recommendation would be to skip this one. Read her new Inn at Boonsboro series books, they're great!"
3,Not a fave NR book,"I love Nora Roberts but this is not going on my fave list. In looking at my NR library, I much prefer her newer books over her oldest (1980s). If you're like me, then focus on her latest, like the Inn Boonsboro trilogy (which has some roots in real life as she and her family have restored an inn of the same name), the wedding series and books like The Witness.As others have said, this story is dated (smoking, etc). My biggest objection is that the lead female has left home in disgrace, never returning even to the US, because she got pregnant out of wedlock. Given that time has passed, yes, out of wedlock babies was a bigger deal in the 80s but I have trouble with the melodramatic approach to this even more than the smoking. Having said that, I liked the development of the characters - Ms. Roberts is always good at developing characters."
3,Good listen for an afternoon drive,The story was different and interesting. The product was clean and error free and played well in my car CD.
2,Not my favorite Nora Roberts,"I'm a scuba diver, so I got hung up a little on the lack of accuracy. I also was bothered that there was no certification required for divers. I liked the main character, but I didn't like Jonas. Not only did he come of as a jerk, I was so grossed out by his smoking I could never find him attractive. He even smoked in her kitchen where her daughter lives. Yuck. Maybe those details were sexy in the 80's, but I found it nasty. Divers don't want to be around smokers."
2,Boring...,"I've read a lot of Nora Roberts novels, but this is the worst novel I have ever read. Absolutley boring till the very end."
3,Simple book,"It was okay. It was simple reading, didn't hold my attention all of the time lso I took longer than I usually do"
3,Good Light Reading,I enjoyed - not as a good a book as her others but I liked the characters and understood the single Mother
4,Risky Busines by Nora Roberts,I liked the story line in Risky Business. I liked that the end had a different twist. I would recommend this book to friends with similar taste.
4,Risky Business,"Another page turner. I really felt for Liz and although I believed I already knew how it would turn out, it was interesting to read through the details."
4,Risky business,Awesome and not disappointing. Nora melts the interest high through the whole story. Great weekend read or a rainy day read.
4,Amateur review,Loved it!!Nora Roberts never fails to.keep you guessing!!! Great read for anyone who.loves romance and sixpence!!! Keeps you believing in love
3,risky business,I haven't read this one yet you make it had having to write so many words when there is nothing to say
4,Great book,I enjoy reading Nora Roberts book they are always very good. She keep you interest all though the book. I'm sure everyone will enjoy it also.
5,Could not put my Kindle down,It was a very good story. I would read until I couldn't keep my eyes open anymore. Always kept you on your toes. A rather nice ending also. Worth the money!
4,Risky Business,"I love Nora Roberts and I loved this book. I like romantic mysteries the best and this book had it all. I loved the lead characters. They were both very complex, but real. I could barely put the book down. Nora, you rock!"
3,Easy read,"This was a nice easy read over the holidays. It was a good mix of love, suspense and a little scuba diving"
4,Never steers me wrong,I thoroughly have enjoyed all Nora Roberts books. They're always a quick read with enough twist to keep you wanting more. Great book!
1,Fiedhands are good; this is the pits,"Buy the Fieldhands' ""Discus"" lp, or buy their great record on SHangrila called ""Wattle & Daub"". But this Siltbreeze release is putrid."
1,Unstrapping Fieldhands is more like it!,"Oh, I would like the Strapping Fieldhands, my daughter said. Wasn't I bummed that Lonnie Donegan had passed? Wouldn't this pull me out of my year-long ""funk""? I told her, ""Don't ever talk to me again,"" and then I ...But I have this disc in the glove compartment, and every so often I take it out and play it just to remember what an idiot she was. These guys sound like they record in a barn and have to put out their own albums. The whole album has something to do with the Jersey Devil. They sound kind of Appalachian, kind of British Invasion-ish, kind of Weird Al Yankovicky, kind of sea-shanty like, but that's been done to death. Nothing surprises me anymore. I hate it all."
4,movie,this movie is so DUMB its funny I bought this for my daughter for her birthday she just love it.
2,Be aware of Full Screen included,"Off of another site, I got this description:3-Disc Set - Keep CaseFull FrameWidescreenSince Leprechaun is already availble in Full Frame, I'm assuming that's also going to be Full Frame on this DVD release. If they are repacking it, they should all be widescreen.The first movie is enjoyable, but nothing great. I never watched the sequels as I was interested in the idea and seeing the first was enough to satisfy that need; and seeing an early Jennifer Aniston, which is nice."
1,wrong color,My husband got this for me for my birthday because baby blue is my favorit color. I was so upset to see light purple when Iopened the box!
5,really neat,"Mystery Science Theater 3000 is something new to me. But it is fun. It is a movie, a bad one with a couple of guys riffing it. If you do not know what that is, well you know how when you watch a bad movie with your friends and you make fun of it through out the movie... well there you go. That is what a riff is. They say funny things about the mistakes in the movie, and bad acting and whatever else they find that is funny."
2,You had to be there,"This could have been better had it included the original movie ""unriffed"" in high def, but overall this title falls short for it's main purpose... hearing the riffs!!! The audience laughter tends to drown-out much of the riffing and took away from the enjoyment of the film. It seems a bit harder to listen to the film, and the riffs, AND the audience and still enjoy it. The random split screen to see the guys was... meh. The shorts were great, but here is my question; if you cannot watch the entire film in 1080p stand-alone, why buy this on blu-ray? to see Michael J Nelsons' pores on his face? I like the guys, i like their work and enjoy their comedy, but this isn't worth owning over a DVD version."
2,Unfortunately taken from vinyl,"This is a great collection of songs which were poorly mastered from vinyl. There are crackles and hiss which you can expect on any old reggae recordings, but some tracks have that repeating sizzle of a scuffed record. Also there are places where the stereo field gets lost and the whole song pans hard left very quickly, usually on fade outs - not a dubby intentional pan left, but a digital mistake in the mastering. I have some of these songs on other CD's that were mastered from the original tapes, and they have none of these problems, so it's frustrating because the crappy quality of this CD ruins the excellent collection of songs, which you won't find together on any other CD.Never trust a review from someone who does not own the product, this is not a five star CD!"
5,Todd Scott,"This album is not won't grab your ears as quickly as the others, but it grows on you. When I first bought the disc I didn't listen it to it much until one long road trip. I was crossing the Mackinaw Bridg, the sun was setting across the lake, and I fell in love with this music. I put the CD player in repeat mode and drove through the night."
3,Dissappointing Second Album,"Following up one of the best albums in Dutch history is always hard. 'Palomine' in my view was the best Dutch album in the 1990's and hopes were high for Lamprey. A little too high, because Lamprey does not totally live up to their name. It is the best sounding Bettie album however and probably the best produced, unfortunately the quality of the songs is sometimes lacking.Only Keepsake, Tell me Sad and Something So Wild can be added to the great Bettie Serveert songbook worth keeping.Still a good buy though, some people think this is the best Bettie album"
1,Cheap! Cheap! Cheap!,"We needed a doorbell as my husband is with Hospice and deliveries need to be signed for. We are too far away from the door to hear anyone knocking. I researched this and it came with great recommendations; however, from the outset it will only chime when it is good an ready which is mostly none of the time. Have to look for another model. This one is going back."
1,SOUNDS AWEFUL,This thing sounds like someone recorded a real doorbell with a bad tape recorder and embedded it in a cheap digital playback device. AWEFULIt doesn't look bad but sounds so bad I must return it. Seller shipped promptly.
2,NO RANGE!,"Product looks great... sounds great... but if you have dense walls (mine are stone with mortar), the wireless range is next to NOTHING! I'm very disappointed."
2,Limited range in stone/stucco homes,"Nice sound, easy to install but if you have a stone or stucco home beware! The product's range is diminished to about 15 feet max thru stone. Mine worked fine for front door when I moved the chime to 10 ft. What I don't understand is the front door and frame are all wood, with no stone obstruction to chime and still the stone somehow absorbs the signal. The other front door is about 25 ft away and it would not work when up against the house..... fine for holding it in the air, but not up against the house. Tech support suggested buying another chime, I suggest they are more upfront about the limitations. Next purchase will not be from Heath Zenith."
3,What I expected,"Gave as a gift, so do not know how we'll it works. It seemed to be a good buy to me."
4,Solid product,"The Chime has been in for two months, sender and chime working perfectly. What more can I say?"
3,Disappointing Range,"""Range up to 150 feet."" More like range up to 25 feet, and that's without any metal present. We wanted to put the bell button next to our deadbolt wrought iron gate, about 50 feet from the chime unit, but it runs out of range only half way there. Otherwise, it looks great & sounds great, but unfortunately with that range issue it's just not going to work for us."
3,Good Album But Not Jack White of The White Stripes,"While this is a good country album, it is not Jack White of The White Stripes. This is ""Jacky Jack"" White an excellent singer and songwriter in his own right. If you are looking for a good country-roots album, this is it but don't expect The White Stripes."
1,Wrong Color,"I ordered these shorts according to the ""russet"" (brown) color that is shown in the image provided on their product information screen. Instead, I received shorts that are the most hideous olive green imaginable. Subsequently, I am not a satisfied customer."
5,GREAT,I got these in white for both my kids... they have lasted a super long time!! i wash them almost every week and they still look like new... and they are super confortable... i will be getting a larger size cause my girls really like to wear them!!
5,All baby girls should have Pediped shoes,"I purchased ""Katelyn"" and ""Chloe"" as a gift for my Daughters baby shower. The ohhhhh's and ahhhhh's of everyone at the shower were uncountable. The shoes were even more adorable than the cute outfits that went with them. These shoes are very well made and are obviously a quality product."
4,Love these shoes one problem tho,"I love these shoes! Everywhere I go I get comments on how cute they are. They fit my daughter great and seem comfortable. When they get dirty all I have to do is wipe them down with a wet papertowel and they are as good as new!My only issue is the velcro seems to have lost it's ""stick"" and my daughters shoes are constantly opening. I have two pair of pedipeds - both have this problem.Even with the velcro issue my daughter wears pedipeds everyday. I havent found a shoe yet that I would prefer."
4,This Love,"This is a brilliantly written book about love and family. I loved how the author used 'solos' telling the story from many points of view, how she really made you feel for her characters. A great first novel from Jackie Kay."
4,the REAL Joss Moody,"While I whole heartedly agree with many of the accolades afforded to Jackie Kay's novel Trumpet, I am stunned that the author gives no mention in a foreward about the true story of a jazz musician who was born a female but passed as a male, married and adopted children, refused to see a physician and for whom a band named their group after his death -- The Billy Tipton Memorial Band. Certainly Kay does a beautiful job telling the story of Joss Moody -- but much of it is lifted from the real life of Billy Tipton. For more info -- see a book titled Suits Me ( I can't remember the author's name at the moment)."
4,Second edition has less detailed examples than the first,"In working through the examples, I found that Blackburn decided to remove the details for the solutions of the example problems and just state that intermediate steps are ""easily calculated."" The answers are still given, but this caused me a problem when I was working the examples and didn't get the answer he presented. I had to refer back to the first edition to catch my error.I would recommend keeping the first edition if you have it, and purchasing this one since he updates the chapter on generator protection (according to the 2nd ed preface)."
3,Not a coffee table book,"This is a bit of a rough effort, and won't be making the Best Seller List, but how many books on this subject do? It seems like a must-have. I would only urge that unless you already know 3/4 of the material, you go through something smoother, such as Power System Analysis by Gross, to get yourself up to that point, because you're likely to be needlessly uncomfortable otherwise. Aside from that, this book will be greatly valued by anyone with serious interest."
5,A beautiful and horrifying film,"This film depicts the depths of debauchery, cruelty, and inhumanity to which unbridled power will sink if left unchecked. The scenes of excess such as the Empress bathing in asses milk which has been provided by slaves constantly toiling to milk donkeys for her pleasure, and the hideous Emperor, Nero, laughing manaically as the magnificent city of Rome is consumed by flames, are eclipsed by the scenes of gladiators forced to grusomely murder even their friends to save their own lives for the amusement of Roman patricians. However, none of these scenes compare to the visceral horror of an old man who picks up a Christian child and covers its face with a wrap so the child will not see the starved and charging lion that is about to devour them. Although not as bloody as modern day films, ""The Sign Of The Cross"" pulls the viewer totally into a world of horror beyond imagination."
1,The Sign of the Cross,"The Sign of the Cross was too gory for my taste. Would not recommend it to anyone. Love old movies, but not this particular one."
4,Good alternative,"I wanted more reach for wildlife photography wanted so I settled on the this lens for use with my Nikon D90. I find it to be sharp even with the 2X teleconverter. I use it with a monopod mostly except for birds in flight. It is heavy and the only monopod head I could find to handle it is the one from Really Right Stuff. The build quality looks to be excellent. If they ever made a stabilized version, which they will one day, the big boys will be hurtin'."
2,slow to focus and inconsistent,"Attach to a camera and put it on a tripod and photos will for the most part be sharp, although the lens would often hunt for a focus causing a delay in the ability to take the photo. Shooting with a monopod, bean bag or hand held and it took excessively long to focus and more often than not the resulting photo would be out of focus. Not motion blur, but just out of focus. The problem was so bad that I returned the lens."
1,sigma 300mm f 2.8,I have bought a copy of this lens for a pentax k-20 and k-7. It is the worst lens i have in my collection. The international warrenty is completly useless. Do not travel and buy this lens. I have had it for three months and it is a good paper weight. I have tried to get international warrenty on the lens and no one in asia services the lens or does not have the equipment to work on it. The autofocus is so far out it is worthless. Sigma says send it in with camera at my own expense. What a rip off. The IQ is very poor for a lens like this.I suggest buying a paper weight for 5 dollars. And not a 3000 dollar one.
5,BREATHTAKING!,"""Pause, take one deep breath, and go beyond your daily life. Music to awaken your mind and spirit, and inspire you to dream"". That about says it all! It is a soothing work of art and breathtaking in its subtle beauty! All stress just drains out of my body each and every time I listen to it! And Bradley has an elegant and radiant musical voice! I do wish he'd sing more in upcominig albums! I love all the tracks but my personal favorites are ONE DEEP BREATH and WATER VOYAGE."
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought this book through the mail, so I did not have a chance to flip through it before I bought it. The product description above is misleading.I bought the book thinking I was going to read many pages about John Lennon and his work with Jack Douglas. I also heard interviews with the author which made it seem as if the book was full of many juicy Lennon tidbits. I was wrong. Essentially, this book is a semi autobiography about the author and his life as a teenager, growing up, getting married, having children, etc. Apparently he worked for several years as a close associate of Jack Douglas and there is much information there, but from my point of view, who cares?This book sucks most people in because it suggests never before released info about John Lennon. However, there are maybe 5 pages on Lennon in the entire book, much of which we have read before, and they are scattered haphazardly throughout. The book is not even organized well.Save your money."
1,Did not work -- waiting for refund,"The meter did not work. I returned the product per vendor return instructions (I had to pay to ship it back--I'm assuming that I will be reimbursed). I was told that it could take up to two weeks for their processing. It has now been over two weeks since they received the product back, and I have not yet received a credit."
2,Not bad but can be alot better,"For those looking to buy this book because of photo's of old Alpina BMW's, skip this book. However, for those seeking tech info and history about Alpina, this book is good. 2002 owners, skip this book also. It's a book to have if you like to know more about Alpina up to the e36's models, but otherwise there's nothing more. There's no part numbers and production dates of the parts listed and little detail goes into the 2002 (only 3 pages)."
4,Excellent source for general Alpina Information,"A great book full of interesting data about the Alpina production. History, units built, specs, everything is there. The only flaw is that it doesn't contain enough color pictures, just a few in the middle of the book. I wish it had lots of full color pictures. Besides that, the information is excellent and a great addition to the collection of any BMW fan."
5,This Lotion is the BEST,I love this Body Lotion. People always stop me and tell me they like the way I smell. If you use this you won't need perfume. It is a clean smell... not heavy at all.
5,Gift of love,"My husband bought this book for both of us to read the summer before we started homeschooling. It was perfect timing for novices and a great tool. It is very easy to read. I highly recommend it to newbies or ""I'm thinking about it"" parents."
4,My Husband Actually Read It!,"My husband does not enjoy reading homeschooling theory, how-to type books, but he read this one and enjoyed it! I read it too and thought it was very funny! It's a pretty quick read and the cartoons are hilarious!"
3,"It's not rocket science, just common sense.","This book is ok but it didn't provide any unusual insight, at least to me. It spends a lot of time discussing a home schoolers life and encouraging a dad to be part of it."
3,"Do husbands really see homeschooling moms as being that""bad""?","I am a single mom who homeschools two sons. I am also engaged to be married. I came across this book while looking for other ones and I like the idea of a book like this. I'd love to get something like this for my future husband. But, I am actually quite worried to buy this one. If he read the stuff available to read on the ""Check inside"" screen, he may seriously want to forget the whole thing! Maybe the rest of the book is a little more positive, but saying a woman only looks refreshed several times a year, and giving the idea that she puts the school and everything else in front of her husband, isn't always true... Does anyone who has read the whole book feel I am being too hard just going off the preview material?I know homeschooling is a tough gig. But I don't want to open up my fiances thinking about it in such a seemingly negative way."
1,Touch of Blue,I can not review something that I never received. I waited patiently for 30 days but have not received this item. Evidently the post office has lost it.
5,Possibly the Best Yet from David!!,"I am here to buy my second copy of this CD, to send a friend. It's gorgeous, not a single song I'd leave off. I've played it for friends who had no idea David was still around (and he is, most definitely!) and others who hadn't even heard of him. Everyone agrees this is a wonderful CD. You really must try it, if you are considering it. You won't be sorry."
3,"Good for its time, but now it depends...","As of April 2004, the monitor is great for a thrifty budget. However, it is bulky and heavy. Be ready to set aside at least $300 for better manageability and picture."
3,Danny Breaks - Another Dimension,"Danny Breaks lives up to his name on Another Dimension, his first album for the Alphabet Zoo label. Most of the tracks are culled from his 12"" off the Droppin' Science label, but his sensibilities are crystal clear. He loves breaks -- not breakbeats, mind you, but old school, hip-hop breaks. His creations are peppered with samples and some wicked scratching. The samples augment the tracks wonderfully, from the Lawrence Welk-like choruses on ""La La La (Pt. 1)"" and ""Down By Law""; the tinkling bells on ""Junkie for Beatz""; or the harpsichord on ""Spirals from the Mind."" But this release is definitely aimed at DJs, who would find that these tracks are perfect for segues and interludes. As home listening, the tracks aren't developed enough to be called songs."
5,Reflections,"Endesha's story, rich in its southern dialect is a remarkable story of triumph, and a testimony that affirms regardless of our past, our pain, our short-comings that within each of us is a tiny seed waiting to blossom. Her ability to surmount the many obstacles growing up in the Mississippi Delta (a black girl) in the 60's serves as a beacon of light for African Americans who are today experiencing the pitfalls of poverty and injustice. Endesha has shown us how a committed spirit can burst forward to claim all that the Almighty has in store for us. Dr. Lady, thank you for pioneering the way. Keep writing!"
2,this tape is does not stick,"we have other colors, two greens, a purple, etc... all work just fine. for whatever reason, this color does not stick. finding strips of it on the floor minutes after applying it. try the purple and green. they've been removed several times and go right back on."
3,Another Kind of Love by Mary Lynn Baxter,"Description from the book back cover:Arkansas Attraction - Adam Forrest knew his life would always be tied to the Ozark countryside - mountains, trees, and the freedom of the great outdoors were his greatest pleasures. But when city slicker Ali Cameron showed her beautiful face in his neck of the woods, she threatened his world - and his sense of freedom. For love had made a fool of Adam once, and he wasn't about to let it happen again. Or was it already too late?MEN: Made in America. Fifty red-blooded, white-hot, true-blue hunks from every state in the Union."
4,What's Wrong With You People ?!?!?!?!?!,"Sad, so sad to see that nobody has reviewed this lonely little album. The Dead C are, alternately, either one of the most groundbreaking ""rock"" bands of the last couple of decades, OR they are a huge hoax played on the record collector scum of the universe. Either way, they get my vote for BAND of the ERA. Anyone with even the slightest interest in drone, heavy sound experimentation, hypnotic repitition, DIY recording, improvisation, and general guitar and drums clutter and clatter, needs to get their hands on anything this band from New Zealand has produced before they all disappear from this veil forever. TUSK, in particular, is a fine place to start. Sometimes executed with a quiet reserve that is downright ominous, the (mostly) lengthy songs spill over into orgies of feedback. Sheer bliss, but make no mistake, it ain't pretty."
1,Empty anarchy,"Fans of anti-music will be psyched with these noise palliates, but while I am no stranger to atonal texture as composition, these droning odes to unhinged feedback come across sloppily haphazard, with very few nightmare-grade industrial pockets of hypnotic sound to thrillingly freak out to."
1,Expired Sunscreen,"Never buy expired sunscreen, or sunscreen that doesn't indicate the expiration date. Sunscreen doesn't give protection beyond the expiration date!"
4,lik focuc producks,I like it and the spray in condishner but i ment to order the shampo. and would like 2 bottels .thanks shawn hall.
2,Could've Been Better,"Wow!!! Was I disappointed! I think the Disney princesses are adorable, especially Belle, but this doesn't show that they have any personality at all. A couple of the projects kept me from giving this book one star but even those weren't that cute. My advice is to save your money for a different princess book!"
4,Great book for ideas!,This is a great craft book related to anything princess. It has given us a lot of ideas. I just need to hit the craft store for some of the items to complete some of the projects! Just make a list and you and your daughter will have endless fun!
2,slippage,the starnut is great except that it slips out of my scooter bars im not sure why maybe it is an aluminum starnut but i dont think that should effect it that much
2,"Looked good at first, then totally died (see comment)","Just purchased this battery a few weeks ago, and it appears to be identical to the stock battery, with the same markings. It is lasting as long as the stock battery did when it was new, so only time will tell how long it can hold its charge. The original battery started losing its charge slowly after about 1 year, and at 2 years, it only gave about 15 minutes of talk time. If this one can at least duplicate that, we'll be happy to have only spent a fraction of the price that Verizon stores charge for this battery."
4,good price,"The battery price was much better than what I had found in the stores. Was not clear on how they where going to ship and did take 8-9 days. So far the battery stays up about 2-3 days, about the same as it should."
1,These Old New batteries that don't hold a charge,"These batteries have to be old stock. I ordered 2 and only used one to start. The wife and I have the same phone. It charged overnite and did not last 12 hours on standby even without use of the phone. When I complained they replaced the one battery with the same problem in a timely manner, then I tried the original battery I never charged. Well all 3 batteries have some sort of problem and don't hold a charge even for half a day. One of them shows dead on the phone throughout the charge cycle. I was very concerned about it damaging the phone, They offered to take back one. Then i gave up it's not worth returning for what the refund would be. For OEM product it is very poor."
1,Cell Phone Battery,Three weeks to receive it. Does not hold the charge for more than 24 hours.Must charge it up every night. Very disappointing.
2,MAYBE IT'S MY PHONE,"Rather than replacing my V710 phone, I thought I'd just try replacing the battery. I was literally getting about 20 minutes of talk time. So, the new battery, you ask? I don't know. Maybe now I get about 90 minutes of talk time. It still feels pretty pathetically short. As of July 1st, I'll be required to use a hands free device when driving. Maybe that will also increase my talk time. Hope so. For now, the price of the new battery is better than the alternative cost of buying a new phone and having to re-up my provider contract."
5,I love this battery and will cherish it for all eternity.,"I love this battery! It is exactly like the old one, but this one holds a charge all day!Its almost like magic, I mean, I have no idea how they can squeeze so much charge in a tiny little thing like this.Its like a dream come true.I can die happy now."
3,Motorola SNN5695 Standard Li Ion Battery for the V710,"2 out of 3 that I ordered worked fine. For the money, not a bad deal!"
1,Don't waste your money,"Yes, it is a genuine Motorola replacement battery; however it doesn't hold a charge any better than the (several years old and now worn out) original Motorola battery. My opinion: don't waste your money."
1,Not good,I was not able to use the battery at all. It claims to be a new battery. But it cannot keep the change not even a half a day.
4,Battery worked,"The first purchased worked very well. It fit the phone and the phone charged and worked.However, the second purchase I am still working on. The customer service at Wireless Unlimited is working with me to find out why the second purchase is not fitting in the phone and working.thank you."
4,Demigod,"Demigod being Behemoth's 7th studio album and their 2004 releases showcases some of the best blackened death metal that I have heard in a long time. The guitar riffs are insanley heavy, and the singing is dark, deep and powerfull. All the lyrics are included in the booklet along with a lot of photographs of the band and a list of whom plays what on the album. We also get a list of companies that they like for instance Dean Guitars. This reminds me alot of Skinny Puppy in how they mix theatrics and music. Allmusic gave the album 4/5 and I agree with them. 4/5."
5,Awesome Death Metal,"What is it about polish bands??They're almost too good at their craft.I have to hand it to Nergal and co this is a powerful and mighty assault on the senses, the playing is unreal.Behemoth has very much it's own sound and vibe, but there are also traces of Morbid Angel and Nile to be found in the mix(which can only be a positive thing)words don't really do the vibe behind the music justice so check it out for yourself. In short this album rips your head off and sh**s down your neck and you're OK about it!"
4,The Apocalypse....,"Truth be told, this is probably my first true death metal record. Im not a fan at all of heavy growling voices such as this (which xplains the 4 stars). The music I usually listen to are Sabbath, BLS, In Flames(old), Metallica(old), Mastodon, and others. But seeming that I listen to classic rock almost everyday and a dose of real heavy metal sometimes, this was refreshing. While metalcore bands pollute the music scene now (norma Jean, As I Lay Dying), a true blow of brutality struck me... Feeling in the mood for something hevy, I downloaded the album of the net. And lo and behold, it is indeed a musical apocalypse. Start to finish, this album RULES. Sculpting the Throne, Conquer All, Slaves Shall Serve, and The Reign... are the best cuts of the album. Very tight playing, musically complex, and plain brutal, start to finish, you will love this album."
5,Extreme Death,"Before I heard this Album I didn't know much about the band, I just had heard a few of their songs and never thougt much of them. But it was until I read great reviews on their latest album (Demigod). So I went to a concert to see them. ( w/ Suffocation, Cattle Decapitation etc). This concert made me realize how talented this band really is. The drummer has a brutal approach with a machine gun type of drumming that is out of this world. The great thing about this band is that they don't lack the use of diversity in the other istruments, like many death metal bands now a days do. Also the singer has a unique voice, it doesn't sound like the typical death metal, his voice is kind of harsh but fits well. (By the way Cattle Decapitation sucks)Overall: Behemoth might actully be the new polish metal kings with this album.Fav songs: Demigod, Conquer All, Xul"
3,"Um, damn.","The band's name says it all. This album is one nasty mamma jamma, for sure. The triggered / replaced drums are laughable though."
1,wretched filth,"I accidentally downloaded a song off this bands first album, Satanica. The song was ""Ceremony of Shiva"". Are you kidding me? This is not music. This is pure hatred. I went on to see if they really were as awful as they initially sounded by listening to several songs and reading thier lyrics along with them. I don't know why such hate is harvested in people who listen to this garbage, but i feel as though it's just a way of people wanting to be passionate about something. Try listening to the other end of the spectrum. It may surprise you. This end did nothing for me."
2,Sorry but this is terrible.,"This is my first Behemoth CD and I almost find it laughable when others desribe this as ""epic."" Nile does epic, this is just crap that goes nowhere. Boring guitar riffs with random note solos just slapped over top, this reeks of untalented to me. The drumming is just OK (look ma I can do blast beats, woohoo!), who knows what he could do with good music, maybe something. The vocals are the worst, he has got some wierd effect on his voice most of the time and is the most monotone, nasal vocalist in my entire CD collection. Whoever told that mouth-breather he could sing in a band was sadly mistaken. Aside from all that the songwriting is subpar and forgetable. In my quest to find good metal I bouth this album based on the hype and reviews on amazon, don't make the same mistake I did."
5,An excellent guide on thinking,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It provides guidance, logic, methods, tools and techniques in the analysis of decision making. It allows us to look at ourselves in different perspectives as to how we react in various situations. It also allows us to look at our own techniques and makes us better in the decision making process and becoming more proficient in dealing with critical issues. This book provides an ease of reference, it is easy to read and extremely useful for any individual in todays workforce."
1,Solar panel not big enough for fluorescent lit rooms,"These will not work under fluorescent lights!! I thought it was broken at first, but if you walk outside, or stand under a ""regular"" light bulb the calculator (Canon Flashcard LS-716H) comes on and works fine. And if you hold the calculator VERY CAREFULLY to directly face a powerful fluorescent light, it will come on and work. That is a profound flaw!! I bought another random other (slightly larger) solar calculator and it works PERFECTLY in all conditions like fluorescent lights. I usually love Canon products, I own Canon printers and digital cameras, and I am usually impressed by the Canon quality and ease of use -> this was a BIG disappointment.Other than the fact that the calculator won't reliably come on, it's pretty nice. It is *EXTREMELY* compact and has a nice solid feel (about three credit cards thick) and looks pleasant. The keys have no tactile feedback, they are just built into the ""credit card"", but they work Ok."
5,Emotional Chaos,"This is the CD that I can't take out of my CD player. Be careful buying it, you may never listen to anything else. This album is a burst of emotions, dealing with everything happy and sad. The lyrics tell complete stories, some I can relate to, some I cannot. They are all backed by Leo Kotke style guitar with a pop feel."
3,Okay album,"About half the tracks are really good (espectially Rita, Angry Words, and Jesus on the Grille), and the rest are nothing much ... one or two I have to skip every time I listen to it (Boab Tree and Flying, for example). A friend played only the good tracks for me (though I didn't know that, of course), I went and got the album, listened to it in its entirety, and realized it wasn't as good as I was expecting. By the way, if you listen to his later albums, Willy has really cheesed out (he was heading that way on Dog-Eared Dream, but now it's just bad)."
5,Porters Best,"A great cd.. angry words, the first cut was featured on the late great Leak Magazine sampler. This is worth seeking out for the first cut alone."
5,VICTORINOX!!!!!!!,What can you say. Exactly as it should be. Built like a tank. You can't go wrong with Victorinox knives. Lifetime Warranty!!!!!!!!
5,SSC,"This is a great movie about many cute little ""fruit"" characters. There is Strawberry short Cake and her cat custard, plumb pudding,almond tea and her pet duck Marshmallow, Rasberrytart and her monkey rubarb, Lemon Chiffon,Angelcake,banana twirl, Mint tea and her panda Marsa Panda, Blueberry muffin and Elderberry owl, Orange Blossom, and many many more!"
2,Princeton Review of Business Schools,"""Princeton Review The Best 80 Business Schools"" provides information needed to make the crucial decision of a school. The book offers insight for a winning application, gives step-by-step advice on writing a good essay, and helps clarify the admission process. It also contains a student ranking survey."
1,This edition of House of Cobwebs,"Customers please be advised: This edition of House of Cobwebs (ISBN 1419166700) contains ONLY the story titled House of Cobwebs, followed by many blank pages to make up the volume. It is not the collection of stories by Gissing of the same title. Save your money and get one of the otoher editions."
2,No fun for our little ones,"I couldn't wait to buy this for our two toddlers. Not long after I popped it open (it is quite easy to set up, takes about 5 seconds) and attached the two tunnels, my kids were happily crawling through it. Then.......uh oh! With normal movement, the tunnels detached easily, the kids found it cramping to sit and play together under the dome, and they became frustrated that they couldn't freely crawl from one tunnel through the dome and out the other side of the second tunnel without getting their clothing and sneakers caught on the sides or on the velcro.My kids are petite, and still they were clumsy inside. They gave up on it after 20 minutes and we just packed it up for return. I read the age guidelines and figured they'd be just fine, but aside from it folding easily and storing conveniently in a carry bag, this is not the oodles of fun that it's advertised to be. I'd recommend a play tent that does not feature attachable tunnels....they DETACH way too easily!"
4,This one is evergreen,"we ordered this when our daughter was little less than 2 and now she is little over 4.Since then she and her friends have played/enjoyed it thoroughly. Seems like a evergreen toy really.The build quality is good, survived the brutal tests kids put it through.Easy to fold and stash it away."
4,good choice,"This is a fun product for kids. They seem to like to crawl through tunnelsand play pretend. It is a little expensive, and not all that hardy--but it is portable."
4,Glad I bought it!,"My 2 yr old loves her playhut. We've even taught the dog to go inside and out, which cracks her up. I love that it is portable so we can take it places and put it away very easily."
3,daughter loves it,"she ran right into it the first time i set it up. not very easy to fold back up all the way, but she likes it so i do too ."
4,my 1 yr old loves this,i had something like this when i was a kid and now my daughter has one and she loves it and it folds up nicely for travel or clean up
4,My Son Loves This Toy!,"This is a great toy for incdoor use. We don't have alot of extra room in the house, but this works out great as it's easy to put up and take down. My son is 3 and he really loves this toy! :)"
3,It's ok...,"I don't know how long this toy will last. It is very flimsy. My 19-month-old is just ok with it--he's not really crazy over it as what you would see on the ad. If we don't play it with him, he won't play with it much. We could've lived without this toy..."
3,Not good quality.,"We bought this tent for our son fir his birthday. When it arrived, the tent smelled like mothballs. It was also so thin you could see through it. I do not think it would hold up to a lot of play. I would condider something else."
1,Smells like mothballs,"I looked for a toy like this for a long time in many places. I ordered it from Amazon. After opening the package it smelled so badly of moth balls that it made my whole house smell like an old lady's closet. The fabric is a type of thick paper-like substance, not like the older Play Hut toys. The colors are not as bright as a result. I'm going to send it back."
3,It is not exactly what I expected,"This tent does not have a bottom. It is supposed to be for indoor and outdoor use and should have a bottom panel. In addition, some of the holes are low and others are higher and my daughter trips over the higher holes because she has to step over them, they are not at ground level. I don't understand why they are not. The reviews say that it is durable but it is very lightweight and appears as though it could break easily. My daughter is 2 years old and not very interested in it. I bought it for her birthday."
2,Useless,"Since we already have the Spanish 1 book and also the Spanish 1 workbook this CD, which can only be used in your computer, is redundant. The workbook has sections that requires a additional CD that is audio only and unfortunately this wasn't it."
2,Not worth it,"I would not recommend this book as a study aid. It has so many English loanwords (words that are the same in English and Hindi) that it should be called 'Your First 25 Words in Hindi""."
2,Terrible Beginner Book,"I bought this book in order to familiarize myself with Devanagari script prior to tackling my Hindi grammar book. This is a terrible book for learning the script. It may serve as a good exercise book if you are already somewhat familiar with the characters. However, it gives a very brief 4 page explanation on the script and the rules and when explaining rules says, ""This is mostly true in modern Hindi but to keep this book simple...."" and so you are left with a brief explanation that may not even be completely accurate. The rest of the book is just flashcards and exercises where you connect words to pictures except that you were NEVER taught how to write the characters or how to join them into a word. I am buying Rupert Snell's book in order to learn the script. Once I have a decent understanding I will move on to the exercises in this book to test my knowledge."
3,I wouldn't get it again...,"First of all, its not an ABRAMS, its a japanese T-90. Yes it is increadibly fun, until the ""all terrain"" it rides over breaks the spokes in the rear axle, which inevitably leads to the tank turning slightly to the left or right, depending on which side has more broken spokes. Then one of the 2 poorly made motors burns out, and the only thing of use becomes the turret."
2,Dislike,"This tank was a gift for my youngest son, who loves all things having to do with the Army. This tank however was not what I expected. It did not work properly and my son was very disappointed. I wanted to return it, but my son is adamant in fixing it."
2,Equivalent to Product Manual from Manufacturer,This book is very little more than a repeat of the user manual that comes with the E-20 camera. It failed to go beyond the level of information in the user manual and therefor was of little value to me.
4,A workman like how-to guide,"The price seems a little on the high-side for a black & white spiral bound book that has a photocopy feel to it. But the plus side: I found it useful. Its content is clear & a little more detailed than the Olympus manual and it comes with a well-presented CD-ROM edition and compact guide. Both can be formatted for printing. Sometimes forget the details and wish you'd carried some paperwork? At only 4MB, the full PDF guide can be copied to a redundant 16MB smartmedia card (you're bound to need bigger storage cards if you're taking serious pics) for reference via your camera and a USB cable through the first Mac (or PC if you must) that you can find. As the only E-20 specific guide that I've been able to find other than the one that came in the Olympus box, I recommend it."
2,Thank god for sound effects.,"These kids may have a 'look' but trust me. This album is a waste if you liked brushed up vocals and kids without real talent. They seem nice but the only one in this group that has talent is Stacey and the rest are just average. Only about 1,000 kids auditioned for this group and it seems the talented ones stayed at home.Recommended Tracks(or singles):Don't Tell me Your Sorry (Single Mix)Fool No moreTurn the Lights OnLove to the LimitPlease consider buying a different CD, or American Juniors, just because the price is too much for this CD, or try ebay and get one for .10"
1,STUPID FRANKIE YOU FREAK!,"FREAKS!!!! Frankie is so arrogant, i saw her at the mall, and she called me the female dog word. she is such a freak. I hate her, and then jay, and calvin started laughing with her. They are all freaks, they look nice, but they are really mean people, i hate them all, especially frankie, she is a real freak.The songs are plain garbage, they stink, and they are so dumb and babyish"
5,Great Cd,Even through I thought this was S Club 7 Euporean Version of thir American cd that was my fought but S Club 8 is just as great if not better than S Club 7.Rondall Banks
4,Just as promised,"The DVD holders were just as promised. I filled up the four I bought so I will be needing more, and soon."
1,Blue Rays do not fit in this case,"Warning, whoever designed this thing needs to get with the program! BAD! The bottom is part open, the case will hold regular DVD's just fine! Because the Blue-Ray DVD's are smaller than Regular DVD cases they will fall out and not be held what so ever! Worthless. Design change to make both work would have been so simple but this case is outdated! Buyer beware! DO NOT BUY IT UNLESS GOING TO NEVER PUT BLUE_RAY DISC's in them as it does not hold them they will fall out!"
3,Yet another repackage release,"One of the best Southern Rock bands of the 70's gets the repack treatment yet again. All songs in this CD have been on several other discs. I'd really like to see a live release featuring the original members of The Outlaws. 1996's package is your best bet for a ""best of"" set. You most likely have all the tunes on this CD already if you are a fan of The Florida Guitar Army"
3,Beginners?,"Despite what the title says... ""Enochian Magic for BEGINNERS"" I felt that this was too dense for beginners. I was quite discouraged after reading almost half of the book because it was too dense! I also didn't like the author's connection with the apocolypse, true or not. If you are really interested in this book then prepare yourself for some hard work. Me? I don't think I'll dabble in Enochian anymore. Good luck!"
5,Enochian Magic For Beginners,"This is a good book, it gives you a background of when Enochian Magic was reintroduced and the concepts needed to understand it."
5,Necessity,"I thought this book was excellent. It's a must read/great reference for the serious student of the western mystic tradition.My only caution would be to be careful. This isnt really ""paperback"" kind of material, and Im not sure about the wisdom of making it so public."
1,WORSE BOOK EVER READ,"I INSIST THERE IS NOTHING ORIGINAL IN THIS BOOK. THE SAME IDEA HE TAKES IT AN EXPANDS IT TO MANY PAGEs. HE JUST USES GREAT TITLLES TO BUY HIS NO B.S BOOKS.Please do NOT waste your money/Time with this book. Its boring and just like many authors he is trying to make money and nothing new in it(Real Shame). I Bought this book because the original book ""How to make millions with your ideas"" was extremely exciting and great. But then the author has simply used the fame of that book to sell his other books. I bought all the rest and they are all boring and I had to stop in the middle. Conclusion: He uses great tittles but the context is extremely boring and unoriginal and you will stop reading"
5,A must read for any entrepreneur or small business person,I love this book. Chock full of great ideas and techniques for maximizing time effectiveness and productivity for any business person.
1,The Author Writes His Own Reviews,"The one thing I've learned about 5 Star reviews on Amazon is that about 90% of the time they are written by the author of the book. If you want the unbiased truth about any book or product, read a few of the other ones."
5,No B.S. Time Management for Entrepreneurs,"This book is absolutely the best I've ever read on time management. Many books on time management claim to have a method that is different than any other time management book every written, but this book is right on target. As as result of reading this book my concepts of time have been altered permanently for the better. Incredibly effective. I highly recommend it."
4,"Practical, direct - just what you'd expect from Dan Kennedy","I've always liked Dan Kennedy's direct no-nonsense approach, and this book is in the same style. This is a book of tactics, not strategy; and some of Kennedy's advice won't suit your style. Perhaps the most useful idea is to take control and don't let other people rule your time and your life."
4,No B.S Time Management for Entrepreneurs (NO BS),A good book that helps one to get priorities right. Some parts I found a bit over the top.
2,A self described success guru with nothing to show for it,"This book caters well to the authors ego. He spares no effort in indicating his aledged intelligence, insightfulness and wit but presents no verifiable data to support it. Suggestions such as read your email only once a week give a good insight as to the overall applicability of this bus stop reading material.A-V-O-I-D."
2,"Type-A Personalities, Beware","Can you spell A-R-R-O-G-A-N-T? There are some excellent ideas here, and some that you will not find elsewhere. You can tell a lot about the author, though, by his statement that you should get rid of a spouse who does not wholeheartedly support the greed-a-holic focus that he teaches. His arrogant, judgemental, and intolerant stances are terribly simplistic and better-than-thou. (Affirmative action programs do not, as he says, try to create unfair entitlement to priviledges that are not deserved.) Learn what you can from this book, but steer clear of the author's attitudes, righteousness, and disrespect of others."
4,The second book,"While the Nursery Crime series is not as good as the Thursday Next series, it is still an excellent series. The Fourth Bear is one of those book CDs, you sit in the car a little longer then you need to so you can hear more. I just wish they would keep the same reader from book to book."
4,Refreshingly Unique,"I love Jasper Fforde's books and this was no exception. They're fun and completely original. It's astoundingly imaginitive and a pure joy to read. While I prefer his Thursday Next series, these are also worth a read."
5,Love it!,"This is easily one of my favorite books. But then I've read all of his books and I can say that for them all. If you like authors like Douglas Adams and Terry Pratchett, then Jasper Fforde is for you. His books are the type of funny that makes you think and just enjoy keeping up with his nimble mind. One thing- although the Thursday Next books are not essential to reading this one, some of the jokes may fall flat or be confusing if you haven't read at least as far as ""Well of Lost Plots."" All in all, lives up to the promise of ""The Big Over Easy."" This is a delightful read that keeps you thinking and is not for a lazy reader. Part of the author's appeal is that he presents cliches and time tested traditions in a new and thought provoking way that just begs you to laugh out loud while it reshapes your way of thinking. Couldn't be better!"
4,Almost perfect,"If you have ever thought to yourself that ""Goldilocks and the Three Bears"" seemed incomplete, here's a book that will satisfy you. Fforde's writing, funny and sharp as usual, is a star on its own. While not exactly his Thursday Next series, this should appeal to the same set of readers. The plot of this book is not quite as meandering as it predecessor, The Big Over Easy, and is much more satisfying at the end. I would reccomend this to anyone with an appreciation of literature and a sense of humor (if you lack one, don't read this)."
5,Hilarious for the literary type,Sly humor combines references to fairy tales and a parody of mystery stories with an interesting plot. Great fun
3,"A Little Boring, Still So Creative","I absolutely LOVE this author's style. Anyone who can take nursery rhymes and create murder mysteries replete with humor and satire is a major plus in my book.In the second installment of the Nursery Crime series, Goldilocks and the Three Bears are caught in a national conspiracy and the Gingerbread Man is blood thirsty as ever. Obviously this is not a nail-biter (unless you suffer from Mother Goose phobia) but it is certainly clever.My only issue is that there are times when the story was a little boring and nothing irks me more in a mystery than when characters are introduced at the last minute who end up playing a pivotal role in the plot. I feel like it's a cop out and it cheapens the story.In any case, I do recommend this book if anything for the humor and to marvel at the twisted lives of our much beloved nursery rhymes."
1,disappointed,"the item i ordered came, but it doesn't work at all. other ones i have do work, so it IS this one that is flawed. i am very disappointed in this purchase and probably will not waste time or money on doing it again."
2,Disappointed came broken,I bought this bobble head for my friend b/c I had purchased one for myself and she loved it but when this one came the head wouldn't bobble.
3,A good Live raw jam,It's good to hear the Santana Band in a raw jam featuring Michael Shrieve and Chepito Areas. The latter were absent from the Live at the Fillmore '68 CD. S.F. Mission District is a pretty decent live recording which allows the Santana fan to listen to the same band who played at Woodstock '69. This one is a must for the true Collector.
5,Hits the mark,"Sturdy enough, easy to insert and then read cd's, not bulky, stackable. Good size for smaller nook spaces vs the also good tower one, which I lay on its side."
5,good for our use,"bought for granddaughter - not much I can say. It is plastic, the clear is very nice looking, and it works."
5,Wonderful :),It's exactly like the picture. It matches my other desktop items and perfect for my small collection of CD's. I love it! Thank you!
3,Over-Priced But Useful,"CDs may be going the way of the dodo, but those of us older than 10 have collected a lot of them over the years. We need places to organize and store them. This wildly overpriced piece of plastic provides that capability."
2,Loaded With Information,"Depending on your knowledge level in this subject area, these guides are loaded with lots of relevant information but it can be a bit intimidating at first. However, good study aid for the more senior knowledge level person."
5,Excellent Songbook,The Hal Leonard Company really did an excellent job in putting together this songbook. Most if not all of the music in this book is letter accurate. Many of the songs have the solos written out so a keyboard player does not have to work very hard. Light My Fire is a rare exception but I doubt any source would ellaborate on the four minute instrumental solo.What's interesting here is that songs from the Other Voices LP are included in this songbook. Other Voices is the first Doors record that was released after Jim Morrison died. It features the vocals of Robbie Kreiger and Ray Manzarek. Too bad that record is so difficult to find. Also included are stories about the Doors music/recording history as well as an interview with Robbie Krieger.Overall an excellent resource for musicians who like the Doors.
3,Nice book,"its a nice book but the guitar parts are quite minimal, it shows only the chords, no riff tabs. Also this isnt acurate, i didnt try al the song but waiting for the sun isnt correct, and love me 2 times. Its totaly different then ray manzarek plays them. and waiting for the sun has the vocal line notes in the piano cleff, its kinda disapointing that it isnt correct"
3,peace frog-blue sunday,"I did not buy but I saw contents and I do not whY do they seperate Peace frog and Blue sunday,one on mY he Doorsfavorites,which I have a problem to cover by myself. To me they go naturaly together end sound togetehr great much beter then separatly.so I want it"
1,Not at all what I wanted,I still have not received my refund! This is the first time that I am returning something to Amazon and I am very disappointed by how long it's taking to get my refund.
2,just pop,"if you're into real trance such as paul van dyk or tiesto or any of those, dont buy this cd.. it's more like the pop music of trance.. i havent even heard the 2nd cd cuz of how pissed i was by the first but i hear its supposed to be a little better at least"
3,"Poor In Comparison To ""I Can Hear The Heart Beating As One""",I was very disappointed in this recording. Maybe I was spoiled by purchasing I Can Hear The Heart Beating As One as my first dose of Yo La Tengo. If anyone is just surfing around Amazon and you want a great Indie CD try I Can Hear first. Outstanding recording. I promise you won't be disappointed.
2,sloppy and derivative,"I love Yo La Tengo's later albums, but ELECTR-O-PURA is disappointing. I love guitar noise bands, but this album is sloppy, derivative, and boring. Fortunately, the closing song (""Blue Line Swinger"") is so great, that it almost justifies buying the album! :-)"
1,I'm sorry,"Having listened to this record, and no other material by this artist, I am sorry to say that this is the worst so-called attempt at music I have ever heard. Even if it were not music, and just sold as ""noise,"" I would not recommend it to anyone. I might add that as a radio DJ, I have played ""Attack on Love"" before, but always with the disclaimer that it is the worst ""song"" in the world."
5,Best Example of the Style,"Electr-O-Pura is highly musical, expressive, emotive, and somewhat imprecise, even veering into sloppy (in a pleasing way, though). This style has always been a part of YLT (you can find at least an example or two on most albums), but Electr-O-Pura showcases it top to bottom. It's best exemplified by Kaplan's guitar work - this album showcases the guitar more than any other - and Hubley's almost unintelligible vocals. Other albums highlight other aspects of YLT (precision, playfulness, vocal harmony, songwriting), but Electr-O-Pura highlights my favorite aspect.The guitar solo on ""Pablo and Andrea"" is my favorite of all time, from any band.I think I understand where they were going with ""Attack on Love,"" as a musical joke before the finale, but I'd have a much easier time listening to it if if it were 60 seconds shorter.I love almost every YLT album, but this one is my favorite."
4,raw sounds of personality,"I actaully made a point of not re-reading all of the reviews because all i remember of them is ""'And then something...' was much better,"" and in short, I don't agree. I found Electropura to have more emotion, and the songs seemed to have to grow on me more, but once they did they really stuck and I didn't get sick of them. track 2, 4, 6, and 11 are the best in my opinion. Of course, yo la tengo at their worst is, at least, still yo la tengo..."
4,a wonderful mess of an album,"not as sprawling as 'i can hear the heart' nor as cohesive as 'painful,' yet it is abundant with brilliant moments just the same, as well as a few pokey onesit furthers the eclecticism that would later culminate in 'i can hear the heart beating as one''blue line swinger' is perhaps ylt's finest hour georgia steals the show with the aforementioned, along with 'decora,' 'pablo and andrea,' and 'bitter end'a must for all ylt fans, casual and otherwise"
1,Truely hideous artwork,"This is the worst looking tarot deck I've seen in years. I give it 1 star only because that's as low as the ratings go. The artwork is unattractive at best. Major problems I have with it include: 1) the high priestess looks like a man, 2) the Heirophant looks like a woman, 3) the ""humanoid"" charachters have been stripped of their sexuality, 4) a Magen David on every other card (it really gets old fast), 5) lame geographic symbols on the minor arcana suggesting that the artist ran out of ideas and had to beat a deadline. If you are a colorblind Jewish woman hater, then this could be your deck. Otherwise, get a real good look at it before you buy."
4,Worked great after modification,"Had to grind out the metal by the rotor holders to get it to fit around the rotor. Otherwise it sat on top and the holders didn't reach the holes. BTW this was for a 2003 Yamaha YZ250F.. Your application may be a little different. Anyway, a bench grinder would be great, I used a 4"" angle grinder (probably to heavy duty for a dremel). Once I ground it to fit around the rotor, the pins fit perfectly and it worked great! It was very heavy duty which was good because it took a lot of torque to get the holding nut off. Considering the OEM holder is around $120, my particular mod was easy, it is very heavy duty, and the holder is adjustable, I highly recommend this tool."
1,Changed meaning in single verse rates 1 star.,"Take a look at Ephesians 4:6 in the NCV vs. other versions (try the parallel feature at [...] ).The NCV sounds very New Age - ""God ... is in everything.""Other versions have that as ""God ... is in all"" or ""God is in you all."" When you take it in context - Paul writing to the believers in Ephesus, it clearly means God is in all the believers, not in everything."
4,How can there not be a fourth??,"These books were funny, witty, informative, romantic, erotic, and I could identify with them very closely (my online nickname is Bevvie). I can't believe that there won't be a fourth. The ending of Crash was intensely disappointing. It's all very well leaving books with a cliffhanger but I'm a definite sucker for a happy ending. Come on Nan, give us number 4 :)"
5,a modern love story,In these days of the internet world it is amazing what information we are able to obtain. Also amazing is the relationships it allows us to gather. These three books are a delightful read - letting us eavesdrop on a budding romance in cyberspace. Read all three today.
1,I wish I hadn't read this book!!!,"I loved the first two books in this series, and liked this one ...until the ending! It was a huge disapointment, and showed no respect for the characters (or readers) to end in the manner that it did."
5,Delish!!!,A great decaffeinated tea!! Perfect before bedtime or anytime! I add a little cream and sweetener and it turns into a delicious light creamy drink! So flavorful!
3,Calcium Powder,"I was excited to see Rainbow Light Calcium Citrate Chocoalate Chewables available on Amazon, and with a price of only $11.99. I generally pay $17.99 from the Whole Foods across town. But when the item arrived and I opened it up, most of the wafers had been crushed in shipping, leaving me a bottle of pieces and powder. While I'm happy about the substantial savings, I'm torn over whether it's worth it considering the condition the product arrived in... or perhaps this was a bit of bad luck, getting a bottle in such rough shape. I'm not sure yet whether I'll buy again."
2,Don't Be Fooled!,"While these are labeled as ""mini-tabs"" they are the exact same size as my once a day daily vitamin. Also, 5 pills is a serving size to reach 100% daily calcium.So the choice is yours... fewer larger pills of 5 of these."
2,Sweet Chalk,"These are huge, oversweetened, chalk-like wafers, with a bit of cocoa added.Granted, calcium is chalky, but there are two potential improvements:1. Reduce the sweetness.2. Put some good fat in them. Chocolate has to contain fat to taste any good."
5,Great Calcium Product!,"This is a great, high quality calcium product. The taste is great, and it contains the necessary supporting minerals and herbs that aid in maximal calcium absorption. I switched to chewable calcium when I became pregnant and had a hard time swallowing a lot of supplements because of nausea. So this product is also safe during pregnancy as well. This is a great product for a great price."
5,Works for me,I do not have any actual lab results to say this increased my levels but It makes me feel better when I take it. I take only 2 a day. It seems to be one of the best brands out there.
5,Online version available,There is an online version of this book available at http://genloc.com/1887/index.htm.It includes a searchable database that is great for genealogy info.
5,The best ever=(,"Soooooo good! It only comes out on Easter though, *sniff* like a true easter egg=( Now that the Easter season's over, I've been looking for these everywhere with no success. If anyone can help me find them, I will ship you a couple pounds of these bad boys, just to show my appreciation."
5,A class act!,"These guys are really great. they gots the goods when it comes to rockin. Heavy beats, thumpin drums, gives new meaning to the term ""creep beat"". I'd recomend it to any one having a party or sleepover."
4,good,i used these for a baby showerthey are cutetoo many words required to answer this section too many
2,Don't believe the other reviews! Save your money!!,Notice how ALL of the 5 star reviews are by people who have only reviewed products by the author. It is probably the author himself trying to pump up sales.You might want to check out 'Light on Yoga' by Iyengar for a good introduction.
1,salsa fan,"I know I could have a problem when I opened the box and the video was poorly shrinkwrapped. I was so anxious to view the tape, but was very disappointed with the quality of the video. Looks like it was a copy of a video downloaded from some cheap site...should have returned it but I had already thrown out the packaging."
4,Good but Small,The product arrived as promised and was new. My dog loved it! My only complaint is that in the picture they show 2 and you only get one and it is only about 3 inches long. It only lasted about 2 days.
1,Dangerous for strong chewers,"Our 1 year old shiba broke a large molar on these, which subsequently had to be extracted. The dental vet specialist who performed the extraction warned us in strong terms away from any processed bone/antler product - if they don't splinter (which these don't) they are still too hard. We had thought it would be perfect, because Sephy had found a couple of deer antlers himself in the hills near our house, and they were quite soft. The natural supply quickly ran out, though, so we thought these would be the next best thing. Boy were we wrong."
3,Buy Chen's steel wok instead,"Hi, I bought one of Chen's non-stick woks -- and gave it to a friend so I could free up cabinet space to buy Chen's steel flat bottomed wok (for my electric stove). You are not supposed to preheat the non-stick wok too high, and never without oil in it. Well, to stir fry, you want to get it real hot, so the non-stick limitation defeats the purpose.I've had no problem with Chen's steel wok without non-stick coating -- you just have to wash it in hot water only (no soap or detergent), dry it, and rub a bit of oil on it after each use. I've enjoyed using the plain steel wok a few times a week for more than six months.Really, don't be afraid to buy Chen's steel wok instead. You don't need a non-stick wok."
2,what is man review,"Virtually impossible for me to read...print way too tiny, even with my magnifier.Amazon might have mentioned this. Warn readers of tiny print."
2,Expected A Little More,"Don't get me wrong, I absolutely LOVE Mark Farina and I have all of his cds except for one: Seasons. (Hoping Amazon will get this one SOON). Any way, this is one that you either love or just don't feel. Judging from the reviews I've read, this is a correct statement. I don't mind the 'talking' or any of his soundbites. In fact, those were the very things that drew me to Mark in the first place. On this particular cd, it just didn't click for me. Well, that's my story and I'm stickin' to it."
3,Mark Farina - Air Farina,"Mark Farina, best known for his jazzy-house Mushroom Jazz DJ-mixes, finally releases his first album -- and it's not what you would expect. House is still the order of the day, but it's more abstract, with cut-up voices. ""Betcha Do,"" for example, sounds almost like Akufen. ""Talk to Me"" has some more of the jazzy chords and deep house that you would expect from Farina, but with the same cut-up aesthetic. ""Futbol"" does the same, except with Spanish vocals. There's a change of pace in ""Dream Machine,"" which features the watery voice of Sean Hayes (not the ""Will & Grace"" star, though) over a downtempo beat, while ""Travel"" throws in the dexterous vocals of the People Under the Stairs. An interesting, if not entirely successful, album."
1,Nowhere near Farina's usual high standard,"I'm a big fan of Mark Farina's DJ mixes, so I expected a lot from Air Farina. It's a perfect example of why it's easier for producers to move to DJing than DJs to move to producing.The production of this CD is amateur at best. The beats are flat and uninspiring. There's no swing whatsoever... it sounds like it was programmed by a robot. Every other sound on the CD sounds like it was pasted in at random intervals on top of these beats. Every song on the album is exactly the same.It sounds just like the kind of music I made after two months of playing with my gear. The difference was I realized I sucked, and Mark Farina is a world class DJ. When judging your own work it's hard to be critical, especially if you're surrounded by ""yes"" men.Mark Farina is a superb DJ, but he needs a lot more time to develop into a competent producer. This album should have had another producer since the concept was workable."
2,Not a good record! :(,"For quite some time now, I have been hearing great things about Mark Farina. So, I picked up this cd at my local HMV. I was suprised to hear a whole bunch of air traffic dialouge. And the music was very repititious and non enchanting. Although there is one gem on the cd. #9, check out the song on Kazaa. LOL"
1,Lacking the Life and Energy....,"I absoloutly LOVE Miguel Migs. His groovy beats are like none other, and unfortunately in this album are not found to the extent in his other albums. I agree with Phopo in that the beats were very repetitive. Not every album is perfect, he'll hit it next time!"
4,"Lucid, well researched and useful","This book is well organized, articulate and insightful. The only reason why I did not give it 5 stars is because the case law cited specific to stalking was rather outdated. Excellent for a theoretical framework surrounding the issue of stalking."
5,Fabulous companion to the movie,"Peter Jackson's remake of King Kong is a huge movie, and this 'behind the scenes' companion is a wonderful complement to it. The book looks great, it's beautifully designed to tie in with the 30s era, it has great photos and is well laid out.Even better, the writing is wonderful. Flowing, informative, conversational and always engaging, it really tells you about the processes of bringing this story to life.Excellent book, well worth collecting."
2,Does not fit as advertised,"It looks good and is put together well...except that, like another review here, only two of the six pockets really fit my 58mm filters. One other worked if I forced it but I didn't want to damage it before I sent it back."
5,Mundell,"Hugh Mundell captures the tru essence of what the rastafari is about. this album is deep and tru. Hugh's voice explodes with passion in every song. one must have an understanding of the rastafarian to really interpret this album, but it is enjoyable to all levels, very mellow and chill. ""why do black man fuss and fight"" and ""jah will provide"" are ultimate examples of Mundell's talent. His voice is a one of a kind that once heard, will not be forgotten. this album is a must have for anyone who enjoys roots reggae and for those who want to understand what the rastafari is all about...."
5,Excellent,This CD is excellent. The dub version is very uplifting. I would recommend it to anyone. A good collection to have. Especially with the new music that's out there that labels itself reggae.
5,For all those who love roots.,You could see his Rastafarian beliefs through his music. Africa must be free is Mundell's greatest c.d. This album is roots and cannot be understood by everyone except people who understand and know about Rastafari.
2,Read in conjunction with Prince of the City,"Giuliani Nasty Man, is a compilation of newspaper columns by former Mayor Ed Koch about Giuliani. The book is not indexed, there is no table of contents, and it is sometimes hard to follow.I suggest reading this book in conjunction with Prince of the City, by Fred Siegel, a much more flattering (and better written) book about the Giuliani years. It is interesting to read the two books together and see how two different authors write about the same events.Jim Fiorentini, Mayor, Haverhill, Massachusetts"
1,"Recycled whining from a bitter, failed Mayor","As someone who saw how Ed Koch pushed New York to the very brink (and how David Dinkins pushed it over), I find it ironic that the famously prickly Koch could attack Giuliani the way he does. Yelling ""How'm I doin'?"" doesn't constitute real leadership. Cleaning up the streets and making New York livable again, as Giuliani has done, is what being Mayor is all about.Maybe some people are nostalgic for the Koch days -- record crime rates, a city in deep debt, Boss Tweed-style graft and corruption, and a Mayor too indifferent to take on real problems -- but reading this book left me wondering just whom they might be.There are occasional moments of ironic humor -- Koch seems to think that he could have done everything Giuliani has done, only with more grace and style. It begs the question: if Koch was such a great Mayor, why didn't he get the job done like Giuliani has?This book is a bitter, angry little screed. Don't waste your time."
1,Unfair criticism of a good mayor and good man,"Those who repeatedly label Giuliani 'nasty' fail to understand him. It's true that he's a tough mayor, but his toughness has actually been an asset in governing New York City--and he's also genuinely a good man who cares about people. Just listen to his radio show or watch his press conferences (in full--not the media's 10-second excerpts).With crime in New York City cut in half over the last six years, homicides down 70 percent, and something like 350,000 private sector jobs created, Koch's criticism comes off sounding like sour grapes. I like Koch as a man and as a mayor, and am disappointed that he resorts so freely to petty assaults on Giuliani's character. This is a tired drum for Giuliani's critics to continue beating."
1,Notice who's writing this book about whom,"First off, this book doesn't get 1 star simply because I disagree with his opinions. I give it that because it's poorly written with underdeveloped arguements that would lead me or anyone who reads this book to think poorly of Rudy. Notice WHY Guiliani was elected: it was because the City was in need of a good right Wing mayor to set the city straight from all of the horrible democratic mayors' screw ups."
1,what a disappointment!,"I was given a copy of the first Seely CD ""Parentha See"", and I must have listened to it fifty times, each time hearing new things in the dense musical tapestries that make up the CD. When I found that they had released another CD, I quickly ordered it and awaited it with baited breath. When it came, I put it in the player and realized that it was all the same songs as on the first CD, just vastly inferior versions as if they had tried to quickly re-record it. Then I found out from the friend who gave me the first one that that was exactly what they did. Do yourself a favor and get Parentha See instead, it is a mountain compared to this anthill."
3,music for bouncy castles,"Originally formed by a pair of architecture students in Atlanta - though I don't know how their buildings stand up, because there's not a straight line in evidence on this album (I like to think of them designing bouncy castles) - Seely make the sort of noises which give American college radio a good name. The single, Soft City, sets the tone: a chiming love song of the ""your sweet face stays with me all day"" variety. Seconds itself is rich with the sound of guitars washing over melting harmonies: songs like Too Fjord Freedom and Love Letters To Rambler are just the thing for autumn nights ahead; the bassy funk of Adios leaves you wanting more."
4,Desperate for GREAT MUSIC that no longer exists.,Beats the crap outta Lady Goo Goo and Bieber. Todays music sucks so bad you have to go back and pick up everything you missed in the 80s 90s and even 70s.
3,a great R&B dance record,"This cd is hot .I love the singles girlfriend and mercedesboy.I also like take your time,slip away,do me right.ths cd is a mustfor pebbles fan."
3,period piece,"girlfriend and mercede's boys are classic 80's r&b/pop but she was such a janet jackson wannabe but without the moves. Had she been as a good she would have made it big in the 90's, but instead she was managing TLC's career and stealing their money which lead the their bankruptcy."
2,The picture is awful.......,"I got one for Christmas and hooked it up when I got home. The picture on my xbox 360 in 720p mode is beyond terrible, pixels are huge, it's got this weird jaggy thing it does on edges... It's really really awful. I don't know how it fares on dvds because it doesn't support the xbox dvd player in progressive scan mode. I was looking forward to my first hd tv and boy is this disappointing, I'm going to attempt to return it, and if they don't take it back It's going in the closet."
5,kGreat Book,"This book is so captivating a just can not put it down. I just got a week ago, and I am almost done reading it. Then of course I will have to pass it along to my sister to read when I am done with it. Liz Curtis Higgs is a wonderful writter, and this finale to the series is just supurb."
5,Outstanding,"Much like Francine Rivers, Liz Curtis Higgs' stories are able to reveal one's true heart and nourish the soul. Bravo."
5,True Grace and greatness for Grace in Thine Eyes,"This story is a beautiful one where you'll find yourself getting involved with the characters on an emotional level. This seems to happen to me every time I pick up one of Liz Curtis Higg's books. Not being a lover of romance/fiction I was at first skeptical about picking up Liz Curtis' book Grace in Thine Eyes. This book goes much much deeper than that. The characters are imperfect, lively, and very real, you'll love some of them, be intrigued by some and just cringe at some. She writes reality into her stories. You won't be able to put this one down! I promise you'll be moved by this story!"
3,I loved most of it,"I absolutely adored this book until the events two thirds of the way through. I was so upset with it that I skimmed the rest and didn't finish the book. I don't care that it was the retelling of a Biblical story, what happened seemed unacceptable to me, I'm sure others enjoyed the ending though.Other than that, I though Davina was very well developed and the whole thing carried a good story line. As a twin myself, I was pleased to see different personalities develop in the Will and Sandy. I have not read the other books in the series but I might look into it now. If you are not so set on your own predictions of the story, you might enjoy it more than I did."
2,breaks your heart...makes your miserable,"Higgs is obviously a great writer, getting you caught up in the story but this turns to be your downfall as she twists the story to tragedy. It will make you cry. But it is such that I put the book down with less than 100 pages left to read and have absolutely no desire to continue the story...the story is beyond redemption for me. I'm sad I started to read it and got caught up in this fatefully disappointing story."
4,One who could not speak,"Not only was I swept back to Scotland in Grace In Thine Eyes, but I found the character Divinia unique. It must have been hard writing a novel where your heroine could not speak due to an accident. Liz did a great job and I was able to know Divinia through other means of communication. A challenging writing venture. I applaud her for bringing into the series such a unique heroine. I highly recommend the entire series."
4,A much improved - and different - remaster,"If you likeed the Frenzy LP or initial CD, you should get this. The sound is much cleaner and a few of the songs are actually a little different. The intro to ABu Dhabi is longer (and better), but while the title track sounds better, it is a little shorter than the original (not good). A few of the other tracks sound significantly better, but the material reflects a band in transition. The horns and wind instruments are gone, and traces of co-founder Phil Judd are not to be heard. Still a pretty good album, but no where close to Second Thoughts or Dizrythmia."
3,"great picture, lightening magnet","This TV has a great picture, great sound, and I love the PIP features. I like it so much that that twice I've had it repaired after being struck by lightening. (Yes, I bought a surge protector after the first time.) Now it's happened a third time so I'm inclined to think there's something about this particular model that either attracts lightening or is very delicate inside. My last TV, a Quasar, was plugged into the same receptable without a surge protector for more than 20 years and never went out."
4,Murphy's Law,I think this is a really nice CD and I think if u like the St. Lunatics then u would really like this CD cause this is a good one!!!
5,Amazing Solo Debut,"I'm a very picky person. And when I pop in a CD the first thing that has to grab me is the beat. If the beat ain't bangin' the lyrics mean nothing to me. The versatility on this CD is refreshing. NONE of the beats sound the same. Murphy Lee's flow is just off the hook. The music didn't over power him. You got the heavy bangers, some hip hop salsa, and the laid back tracks all on one CD. Anyone looking for simply good music should pick this one up."
5,hotboymont504,"I like the cd murphy`s law one it murphy lee two it a good cd .it has wat da hook gon be ,and love me baby all in all it a good cd. hotboymont504@i-squrd.com"
5,suzys review,this cd was mad good. i bought it as soon as i oculd. hwen i heard what da hook gon be it became my favortie song. The song this goes out that song is off da chain murphy should go big with it.i like same ol dirty alot also. well if you havnt gotten da cd u need to becasue its a tight cd and all the songs are good.
4,Fun.,"If you need a break from the hardcore styles of Westside Connection, or the angst of Eminem, this is the album to get. Murphy Lee is like Ludacris just plain fun."
3,murphy's law cd,c.d. arrived in a timely fashion and in as-stated condition. highly recommend the seller to all potential buyers.
1,Worst!,"Definately one of the worst Rap albums out there, again hurting the south's already bad reputation of weak lyricists. The beats are something left to be desired, while the lyrics suck. Many of the featured artists on the album don't help. Two notables (on the good side) are ""Shake Ya Tail-Feather"" feat. Nelly and P. Diddy and ""This Goes Out"" feat. Lil' Jon, Lil' Wayne, ect. If you were ever impressed with the radio play of ""Shake Ya Tail-Feather"", don't buy Murphy's Law, just download it as it poorly represents the rest of the album."
1,disgrace,music like this makes me feel almost ashamed to tell people i like rap...everyone says hip hop is dead because of people like him. dont waste ur time/money...and the only reason im reviewing this is because it has 4 stars at the moment which is about 4 too many...
1,WHY?,I remember a time when rap music was good. And this album only reminds me of how corney rap music is these days. Please dont support this cornball album. I mean how corny can a album get. It just makes me mad because its just not good music at all. Where's Tupac when you need him?
1,A frustrated hip hop head.,"This is the last straw. Murphy Lee cant rap for gods sake, neither can 99% of the rappers on MTV nowadays. Why did my favorite music genre have to have gone mainstream? Rap is just the next disco or funk, notice how nobody likes those anymore becuase pop culture ruined them for people who liked it. ANYONE who owns a Murphy Lee, Nelly, 50 Cent, Ja rule, Chingy, Lil anybody or w/e is not a hip hop fan but a mainstream loving loser who doesnt know hip hop at all and is just trying to like what everybody else likes so they can pretend to be cool or ghetto. Go home MTV and BET and give us back the hip hop we know and love. Support the underground real hip hop heads and ban the fruity mainstream.Peace"
2,i was expecting better from murph,"nelly is pretty good, ali is alright, and khijuan is alright- murphy lee is my second favorite member of the st. lunatics until it comes to solo. he cant make a hit without nelly and hiz boyz. sorry murph. better luck next time. the only good songs are....................................""Hold Up"" (Featuring Nelly)""What Da Hook Gon Be"" (Featuring JD)""Luv Me Baby"" (Featuring Jazze Pha)""Murphy Lee"" (Featuring Zee)""Shake Ya Tailfeather"" (Featuring Nelly & P.Diddy)"
1,murphy lee,"Don't buy this album, it is weakly put together and it does not live up to the hype. Nelly is the only thing good about this album. The beats suck and the lyrics are not interesting at all."
4,Murphy's Law: dalunatic9 reveiw,"I'm not gonna lie murphy album is hot. The songs I dislike the most are red hot riplets, same ol' dirty, and so x-treme. Other than that the album is fire. The skits are funny, and the music can keep you pumped. I can't wait for second album 2 come out."
5,I Luv it!!,"Murphy's Law is off da chain!!! I luv it!!! A day never goes by without me listening to it, I luv all his songs. You can tell he is a very talented artist and dedicated to his music."
4,The best is yet to come,"Man, when i heard Murphy Lee was coming out with his own album i must admit i said it wasn't going to be as good as Nelly's i thought sure he sounds good on other peoples stuff but a whole album of just Murphy, but boy was i wrong he has the hottest beats and he sure can rap. So i suggest that you go ahead and purchase this album because its worth it!!"
5,A MUST HAVE,"This album shows Murphy Lee at his best. It has some SERIOUS club joints and the skits will have you peeing in your pants. With guest appearances by Lil' Jon, Jermaine Dupri, Lil' Wanye, and Jazzy Faye this album is sure to go platinum in no time.Oh and for the ladies, there are some lovely pictures."
1,The Reason People Don't Like Rap,"People like this Murphy Lee idiot, is what makes people not like rap. Murphy doesn't need a hook, because this CD should've never have been released. His lyrics are pathetic and a joke, he has no wordplay and probably doesn't even write his own stuff.This is a waste of money, if you want a good CD with good lyrics go buy one by, Akrobatik, Mr. Lif, Aceyalone, Atmosphere, MURS, Cannibal Ox, or Talib Kweli."
2,The Law...,"Murphy Lee is an aight rapper to me but not someone I would want to listen to for an entire album. That's the major reason this album gets only a two from me. He has a really good technique but it's just not my cup of tea. The beats for the most part aren't that hot save for What Da Hook Gon Be, which is a straight up Classic across the boards. Matter of fact if it wasn't for that song this album would have went under my radar. But on the real his beats are what really turn me off...they have a 'glossed over' feel and I don't like that I like stuff you can ride to. However I can see how other people may like it...he's a very entertaining rapper with mediocre beats. 2.5 Stars"
1,DON'T BUY,I AMS SO SICK OF THESE WHACK RAPPERS DESTROYING OUR INDUSTRY! GIVE IT UP FOR CHRIST SAKES!
4,**Murphy Lee is on FIRE**,"The cd is tightwork. Luv Me Baby is my absolute favorite. I love how he reaches out to the ladies on this one. I must admit I was a little weary about the cd because it was his first. But Murph came through with some outstanding colabs. The track Murphy Lee is also hot, it samples Marvin Gaye's Mercy Mercy Me. There only one or two tracks that I could not get into which is good because it is hard to find a cd you can listen to from start to end without skipping tracks. Big ups to Murph, keep doing your thing."
4,No Games,"I believe that it is really good CD, for it to be his first CD out. There are songs on there I don't like but there are more likes then dislike. I know that he could of done better then he did. I believe that on your first CD, you should give us something to listen to but to much you run out of ideas, and you come back out with nothing on your second CD."
1,WACK,"I have listened to alot of hip-hop in the past 4 or 5 years and I must say that Murphy's Law may be one of the worst albums I've ever heard. When anyone raps ""I'm like a special cop/I stay undercover"", they are not worth my time or money. Every rhyme is weak and with studio time and a homeless person off the street I could make a better album. But then, what else would one expect from the St.Lunatics?Peace"
4,This album is hott,I like the Murphy lee's cd murphy's law its hott and I listen to it all the time. The song Wat Da Hook Gon Be is of Da hook. that song is got a great beat and its got good lyrics. overall the cd is hott all U people who r thinking of buying it should buy it its hott.
5,Murphy's Law,This album is soooooooo hot!!!!! You can just sit in yor room and just listen to it. You don't have to skip any songs.They all will make you feel like dancin.MURPHY LEE did the damn fool when he made this. There are no songs that you won't like. Take my word for it. THIS ALBUM IS ON FIRE!!!!!!
3,Not Great But not Horrible Either,First of all murphy lee is not a southern rapper u idiots murphy lee is a st.louis rapper so he is from the midwest. duh they made the song midwest swing! but anyway dont get me wrong murphy lee isnt all that bad of a rapper his skills are still devoloping and this cd was made by a immature person so thats just what he needs to do mature as a artist. and im sure his next cd will be better i mean hey it couldnt have been that bad it went GOLD!!!
1,What Is The Hook Gon Be?,"What da hook gon be?Did anyone notice that... that was the fu*king hook?I love rap, just not ignorant moronic rap such as this."
2,2 Stars,"Murphy Lee is the best St. Lunatic hands down, although his album is full of wannabe pimp garbage and I expected better from the only St. Lunatic I had faith in. NOT RECOMMENDED."
2,Murphy Lizzel's a peice of Shizzel,"This CD pretty much sucks. I think there are only 2 or 3 good songs on it. Murphy doens't possess flow like Ludacris does. I wouldn't spend $15 on this, which is better used as a drink coaster than for entertainment. Most of the beats up here don't get your head movin like they should. The cameos from Nelly are what gave this CD a 2 star rating. I hoped for more from Da Skool Boy but he just didn't deliver. Not woth the investment."
1,Season of da sickness,this cd is horrible. there is not anything on here at all. this music sound like some old underground in da kitchen songs.
2,Way over rated,This album was a total dissapointment! There are about 2 good songs on this cd. If you read anything saying that this is album is over 2 stars the person who wrote the review is on CRACK!!!!!!!!!I gave this album 2 stars because of the 2 good songs on this album(and one of them has nelly on it who realy make the song work. MURPHY SHOULD GIVE UP ON MUSIC!!
1,not a rapper,"sellout, mainstream, pop star, mtv/bet killer, cannot rap, only girls wanna bumb this garbage."
4,Nice Start For Murphy Lee,"First off, if u dont like St. Lunatics dont think this album will suck. It is mad hot. Theres a lot of bangers on this cd too. Only reason i gave it a 4 is because i had to skip threw a few tracks. Besides that the junks hott. Go and cop that disc."
3,This is what dababygurl613 thinks,After listening to those samples i think that Murphy's Law y Murphy Lee is an awesome cd! I only rated it three stars but cause i didn't have the opportunity to listen to the whole cd or to buy it yet! I really like the beats if his songs!
4,Murphy's Law is Bangin,"The first time around, I only thought a few songs off the album were hot. But after hearing it again, and really listening to what was goin on, I really enjoyed the CD. Murphy's got the beats and rhymes that everyone likes to listen to and he ain't rappin about negative stuff. Which is usually the Lunatic way. I gotta say, ""luv me baby"" is still the best song on the album. But all the joints on the CD are hot and he keeps me interested. I can't wait to see what he'll do next."
5,MURPH DURPH da schoo boy,"~Murphy Lee~comin out of ST. LOUIS with the LUNATICS >nelly, kyjuan -hiz bro-, ali, & slo down<. This nu albumm of his-MURPHY's LAW- is blazin!!! MurphY uses his sense of humor with his quick rhymin style to hit up each trak with flava. MURPHY'z got skill so cheq this albumm out itz sure too stay rotatin in your cd playa!!"
5,Mom's Christmas Present,"My Mother loves it.It's a beautful shade of green and well made.The fleece lining makes it different from other quilted jackets,making it even wearable in winter months.My mother has paired it with a solid tee,jeans,and tennis shoes,this showing that is great for casual wear and casual dress.You can't find at better quilted jacket at this price.Becky Winfield"
2,Size completely off!,"The jacket itself was very nice, but the size was completely off. I purchased an extra large and it was hanging off of me! I think purchased a large, but the company mailed me the wrong jacket and i was then informed that an exchange could not be done because the maker no longer had the product. Really a big disappointment."
5,EXCELLENT ~ Album!,"This all around good album is due to several strong supportive album tracks ~here are some of McCready's best - ever performance's.All are especially good songs ~ good harmony ~ music ~ clever & passionate ~ 'I'm Not So Tough' ~'Two Different Things' ~ 'Dream On' ~ 'I've Got A Feeling' ~ Over And Over ~ 'Lucky Me' ~and ~ 'Take Me Apart' ~Also one of the best here is the one song that made the country chart.""All I Want Is Everything' is a great up-beat song ~ although it didn't have much chart success.Here's a great set of songs with McCready at her best on these excellent album tracks."
5,Great CD,"I've always loved Mindy McCready's voice, and this CD is a great showcase of it. My favorite song is ""Lucky Me"" because it makes me laugh! Other favorites are ""Thunder and Roses"", ""Hold Me"" I can honestly say that there is not one song on the CD that I don't like, they are all great and I really think that any could go to radio. Radio, needs to play more of Mindy, she's got a great voice, great songs, what more could they want? Not to mention that her voice is natural talent and better than a lot of people that they do play on the radio! Buy this CD, you won't be disappointed if you are anything like me. This CD is great and one of my favorites, but I'd love to see Mindy put a traditional country song on a CD, I would LOVE to see her do a Crystal Gayle song, that CD would get ten stars!"
3,Not a whole-hearted attempt.....,"Mindy McCready did not stretch far from th rules on this one! Honestly, this album is somewhat disapointing. While she tries, there is not enough emotional vigor to make this one worthwhile. This album did not recieve any airplay, and quickly fell off the album charts. This girl better get her act together, or she will see her once promising career fade into nothing. Otherwise, the song' Over and Over' is waht persuaded me to give it three stars."
1,Don't Waste your hard earned dollars!,"If you are looking for the energy of her first album, you won't find it here! I see now why they are giving away her last album free with this one. The two will make a nice pair of drink coasters!"
5,definitely worth it,"I've had this cd player for 3 years now and it still works fine, you CANNOT get it to skip. This player was worth the few extra bucks because I doubt any other player would of lasted this long with all the use and abuse."
4,Go for it!,"This was fantabulous! I loved the unexpectedness and richness of the story, the often-unusual (for Victorian times) costumes, and the superb acting. What a treat, visually and emotionally! If you liked ""The Piano,"" this film is for you. If psychological mazes do not intrigue you, stay away. And I certainly WAS surprised at the ending -- and this rarely happens to me anymore. All in all, this was an exhilarating two hours. Enjoy!"
2,This movie will bug you,"The story of this movie can be summed up in four lines: Man goes to live at mansion. Man falls for and marries daughter of the house. Man learns BIG SECRET. Man runs for it. That's it. For two hours. Did I hear you say the pace is slow?The filmmakers did manage to make Patsy Kensit's face look repellant. That certainly is an achievement. I guess. Shaved off her eyebrows. Colored her lips and face pale--the death-warmed-over look. There is brief full-frontal, but the effect is spoiled by that ghastly face. (To see what she really looks like, get Adam Bede.)To say that any relations between the bugs and the people is strained or far-fetched at best would be an understatement. But I guess people who paid for this movie need some illusion of profundity to justify their wasted time and money.The big surprise at the end can be seen coming from miles away. In the end, your feeling will be the same as the man's--Let me out of here!"
4,Unflinching and colorful --in more ways than one,"Sometimes, the costumes and scenery almost threaten to overwhelm the story. However, the actors and the plot prevent this. In sometimes graphic detail, the Victorian society is turned inside-out to show what lies just beneath the surface, waiting to be discovered in all of its shame."
3,"Good movie, poor quality DVD","The movie itself is great, as the other reviews mention. I just wanted to warn potential buyers about the quality of the DVD.The video quality is horrible and looks worse than many good VHS tapes. There are moire patterns and ringing in each scene. The scenes are out-of-focus.This is very distracting since many of the scenes and costumes involve bright colors and horizontal stripes which only make the problem worse."
1,Don't Buy This,"This is not a review of the movie, per se, since I did not get past the first 10 minutes. The DVD is lousy. First off, it is not a 1.85:1 aspect ratio. It is letterboxed, and the figures on screen come off as being somewhat distorted/stretched, as though one stretched a 4:3 aspect ratio movie into widescreen. The biggest problem, though, is that the video is somewhat out of focus and blurry, and it is so distracting that I could not watch anymore than a few minutes before turning it off. I am sending it back for a refund."
4,Interesting,"Although I wasn't crazy about this film, I will admit that it has fine acting, lovely reproduction of the Victorian era, and a somewhat creative plot (although the ending seemed a little sudden). If you have a taste for the slightly bizarre, you might like this. And in case you dislike nudity in movies, don't worry--it's not so bad, and tastefully done."
5,great,The snagless feature was a lifesaver as we snaked this cable down into our basement and then through existing holes filled with other cables the entire length of the basement to our router.
5,Excellent book,This is a must have book for teachers. It really helps explain how to teach writing. It is organized by type of writing that you would teach. The lessons are easy to follow and adaptable to various levels. Highly recommended!
1,It is a great book,"First I think that this book is really a great book. But, I have a coment on the website I think that you should let your veiwers at least read inside the book to look at the books format"
4,Benchley pulls another monster from the deep blue sea.,"Beast is a simply superb stream lined thriller of a monster novel. The nearly mythical giant squid, now starving from over population, a situation caused in part by man's hunting the squid's predators to near extinction, rises to the surface and begins to hunt man just off the coast of the Bermuda islands. Benchley keeps the plot moving so fast that you can forgive him for simply rewriting Jaws as a better novel (Benchley even throws in a joke or two about his previous sea creature chiller). If you have only seen the horrendously bad mini-series adaptation then you are missing out on a real treat of a book. Highly recommended."
5,Benchley finds a successor to Jaws!,"Peter Benchley, for a long time a favourite writer of mine, didn't disapoint me one bit with this crackerjack thriller in which he replaces a great white shark with a far more terrifying antagonist; the giant squid! Filled with colourful characters, unbarebly tense situations, a strong, none-preachy enviromental message, and some witty digs at the movie version of Jaws, make this a winner."
5,It's the scariest book I've ever read in my entire life.,Beast is about a giant squid coming to Bermuda and attacking people (same concept as Jaws). Whip Darling is the main character and he is trying to stop it with a Navy SEAL and two rich men whose childeren where victims. Will they suceed or will the squid take over Bermuda???
2,If you read Jaws don't even bother with this one.,"I was really disappointed with Benchley's writting in this book. It was just like reading Jaws all over again but not as good as that book. He had characters dying the exact same way they had in Jaws. I was hoping for a little more originality especially since he had done it before, and he had also borrowed these death scenes. From Moby Dick. He went with the same formula that made Jaws a hit, but I really wasn't looking to read the same story twice."
2,"Promised a lot, but lacked more than it promised.","Okay, I like deep sea adventures novels, such as Sphere, MEG, and Goliath and I picked this book, hoping for a somewhat scary novel about a giant squid. I was sadly disapointed at how boring this book is. Even during the most exciting parts of this book, it is dull. I'm just glad I didn't buy this book."
5,Riveting!!!,"This is Peter Benchley's best book ever. An Architeuthis - a giant squid - creates horror and fear off the coast of Bermuda. Whip Darling and his friend Marcus Sharp figure out who responsible for this madness and must confront the huge beast, which knows no fear. Dark, scary, creepy with excellent writing, supern characters and incredibly tight action, this book delivers on all levels. I wish Benchley would write more such classics."
4,Makes you want to forget about that beach vacation.,"This is the first, and as yet only, Peter Benchley book I have read. It won't by any means be my last.This book made me want to keep reading, in a way I now wish I didn't, my fear of the ocean now goes far beyond that of a fear of jellyfish (a childhood incident).This book is truly a good read, it tells the story both from the point of view of the human characters but also the 'beast' itself, what drives it to do what it does and how it is that it has come to be in the situation that it is in.I give this book 4 Stars, I look forward to reading other Peter Benchley titles."
4,dont go near the water.,"this is a great summer read. i read MEG before this and it outshines MEG in everyway. its fun, scary, entertaining and benchley pokes some fun at himself and JAWS. a great read."
3,OK,"I like the author and have read several of his other books. He writes clearly and plainly, and the books are effortless to read, and enjoyable. His research is excellent and his locations are unique and exotic. His characters draw empathy and he keeps the plot simple, yet enthralling. It's a good read."
4,Another great ocean thriller from Benchley!,"In the tradition of ""Jaws"",Peter Benchley writes anotherdeep-sea thriller in ""Beast"".The balmy isle of Bermudabecomes the feeding ground for ahorrific creature that makes theGreat White seem tame.Benchley has a passion fordetail in his writings, lettingthe reader become a part of thestory. His knack for characterdevelopment reveals itself inthe story's hero, Whip Darling,who seems morehuman than perhaps your nextdoor neighbor.Perhaps the author's mostvaluable trait, though, is hisknowledge of life on, and under,the sea. The trivial factoidsmake the book seem almostnon-fiction and therefore, muchmore terrible.If you're in the mood for aspine-tingling thriller with atouch of reality, Peter Benchleyis for you, and ""Beast"" is oneof his best!"
4,surprisingly gripping,The sequel to Desert Flower; it is an amazing story and the continuation of the first adventure. It reaveals how other people live in our world. It is an easy read. I finished it in two days. This book will give you lots to debate at the dinner table.
2,Took Out Gods Name,I really liked the bible but I am disapointed they took Gods name Jehovah out in the old king james it says at psalms 83:18gods name is Jehovah the most high over all the earth. as well as isiah 43:12 which says you are my wittnessess is theutturance of Jehovah. Thats the reason I bought the king james. so I would like a refund and return this book.Thank You
4,Weird Prices on Amazon for this Bible,"I love this little bible. There is enough room to write notes on the side yet small enough to put in my purse or pocket. It's lasted about 5 years now and though the 'bonded leather' wore off at year 4 and the 'snap button' broke at year 3 - I still love it. The stitching/bonding holding the pages together is great, I've had no problems with pages falling out. The font size is super small by the way, I'm farsighted so it works out for me but I know that not everyone would be able to comfortably see such tiny print."
3,"It IS small, but the print is too small","I knew the print would be small, but this is a bit too small in my opinion. But this bible does fit in your pocket and therefore is super portable, which is what I was going for. So I am ok with it, but I just wish it had slightly bigger print. NKJV is my preferred translation, so its nice to have a portable version of that. A lot of them are KJV and that is hard to understand, NKJV is a lot more readable."
2,The Smallest Bible,The Bible was exactly what I wanted but the print was to small to read comfortably for me even with the magnifying sheet. I liked the cover of it. I have returned the Bible to you and I assume you have credited my account.I like the availabilty of ordering from Amazon and having it delivered right to my door.Thank you. Margaret LaFollette
3,Bonded leather,"This Bible format is a great idea, but bear in mind that it is bound in bonded leather, not ""high quality leather"" as the product info states."
1,I would not reccomend this shower chair,"I purchased this shower chair because my back pain makes it difficult for me to stand in the shower or get in and out of the tub. I was pleased with it at first, but then one day I heard a loud crack while I was sitting on it and the legs began to bow inward. I am by no means near the 400lb weight limit it is supposed to have. I can see no visible cracks in the chair, but the legs continue to bow when anyone sits on it. Because it was still under warranty, I called the manufacturer, but they simply referred me back to the seller. I would have thought they would have been interested in examining the chair themselves to find out why it had failed."
5,Positive Review,"I have sensitive oily skin and therefore am catious about putting things on my skin. It's also tough to find things that work with my skin.Body Polish by SkinCeuticals is one that I am so happy with. It goes on easy, and washes off easy. It feels great and doesn't damage my skin. After use it makes my skin feel so wonderful. I use it before doing my nightly skin ritual. It makes the skin a clean palette to work with.Really great product.Fast shipping as usual from SkinMedix's store."
4,Good!,Little long for shipping. Other than that great condition and it was a great present for my mother who grew up watching this show. I recommend this company to others.
2,DVD Regions of the World,"Fast easy trade, the DVDs arrived here promptly and look in good condition but the DVD's are not for our region of the world, so they don't work here in NZ. Unfortunately I didn't see anywhere on the sale that indicated which regions of the world the DVD's were for. Is there anyway anything can be done about my purchase?"
4,Good Reference Book,I'm very happy with alot of this book. It's got some good information that would have taken so much time referencing it myself. I'm not extremely impressed with the way the outfits are displayed or how many were missed. But I'm happy I bought it.
5,Crissy Doll and Her Friends,This is a very good book for anyone collecting the Crissy dolls from 1969 and 70's. Clear pictures in color and very informative.
2,Staged Footage About Cryptid Beasts,"I was expecting an actual documentary on the legendary Thunderbird, but instead was disappointed to find that this was nothing more than a staged act done on purpose for the sake of provoking a reaction of 'what if this really happened?' I gave it 2 stars because I thought the acting was convincing enough, but the 1 star came because this was just a little 'horror' tape about three young boys who sneak out to a remote area to skateboard without their parents' permission, and the youngest kid ends up being taken away by a giant bird that is never seen in the first place. If you want a more 'serious' take on the subject, I would suggest looking at 'Monster Quest' from the History channel."
1,Seriously? You really have to ask?,My kids liked it. The adults tho were bored beyond compare. Don't waste your brain cells! Watch ANYTHING else!I can't believe I watched the whole movie just to realize how stupid it was.
5,LOVE LOST TAPES!,I love the lost tapes show! it is my favorate to watch on tuesday nights! i never got to see all of season 1 now i do! Im watching it as im writing this! im loving it sofar! i cant wait till season 2 comes out! it kinda raises the question what is really out there! i belive that the paranormal exsits and that there are things that cannot be explained.
4,Lost Tapes,Item came intact and in good time frame. Is good to see with others but not if you're scared of the dark!! Will use vendor again as they were prompt and fair priced.
4,I like it!,"Right off the bat, take it for what it is, a collection of fictional Blair Witch type of stories based on the possible existance of creatures like bigfoot, The Chupacabra and other 'Cryptids'. That said, sit back and have fun. The fictional 'found footage' is interspersed with baseline back ground information on the subject creature and is actually far more entertaining than the Monster Quest series that never turns anything up. As with any show some episodes are better than others but on the whole I like it. Favorite episodes include 'The Hell Hound' and the 'Monster of Monterey'."
3,It's Okay,"My Little boy liked this movie. I thought it was okay. The Bigfoot was pretty cool. To tell you the truth, I loved Harry and the Hendersons. This is sort of a cheap remake of Harry and the Hendersons, All-in-all this movie wasn't a total loss, because my little boy really liked it."
1,Meh!,Discovery Channel and TLC used to have excellent educational programming a long time ago.Now they a massive load of useless programming like this and many more.
4,good,I enjoyed these. The stories are good and so is the acting. There's alot of build up but they never really show anything. It just leaves you wondering. But still pretty good.
2,Was this script written by a pre-teen?,"Main characters Percy, Devlin and Cletis; one could give draw a character profile from the names alone. I chose this movie out of my curiosity in cryptozoology and found it was more about loveable monsters. Hokey to start and got Hokeyer as it went on. Perhaps the second half of the movie improved, Hint fantasy painted as reality doesn't work. On the up-side, at liast it is suitable for family viewing."
3,ok,"not bad, a little cheesy but it can be interesting, so I would watch more if there is one I am interested in."
5,This movie rocks!,My daughter loves this movie!! She watches it over and over again. I highly recommend watching this movie as a family.
4,Entertaining enough,"My almost 8 year old and 6 year old daughters really enjoyed this movie. No award winner, but perfect for a rainy day."
3,Just Average,It was too fakey. It wasn't that believable. Even as a kid I expected it to be more realistic. I would recommend this movie only for little kids ages 4 to 7.
5,Close to perfect,"Greatest functionality in a decent pocket knife (vice pen knife) size. Can/bottle opener tool performs both functions well. Scissors are a must. I have actually used the cork screw a number of times. Pen's a little too dinky for me to write with legibly. Pin? Yeah, ok, I think I've used that too. But THE HOOK???? I agree with the other reviewer, replace it with an awl. Otherwise, a superbly designed knife that is with me everywhere except aircraft - THANKS AL QAEDA!"
2,review from a Vietnamese who teaches Vietnamese on Sundays,"I found this book at the local library. I thought I like it because it gives me ideas how use it for my Vietnamese language class. But after I read the other review about errors, I took another look at the translation. The other review is right, in that the some of the words aren't translated correctly.So, do not buy this if you want to learn Vietnamese.I find it useful as a guide in ways I can teach my students."
5,Nora & Mick {Need we say more?},"No, really. Need we say more than the title already does? I love this book series and can NOT wait for the next book. Hoping the author does not take another four years to get the next one out. Read this book or any other in the series and get ready for Mick to hook you in on his trout line along with Nora."
4,Got to Love the Blackbird Sisters.,I have read four of these books so far and they are such fun. If Nancy keeps writting them I will keep reading them. Great mysteries with wonderful clothes and characters.
3,Figured out why I don't like these books,"I don't like the Blackbird sisters as people, plain and simple. They are vain, selfish, and irritating people. Why would I want them in my life long enough to read books about them. I kind of fought this. The books are writen fine. But I kept realizing I didn't want to read about those women."
4,Some Like It Lethal,"What a hoot!!!Nancy Martin's characters are so enjoyable. And Spike!!!I want a dog like him. I laughed until I cried picturing Spike at the Koats for Kids party. And then I reread that section a day later and had the same experience again. Just what is needed on a bad day. To be truthful, the book has a good plot and is a quick read. I didn't guess the killer until Nora approached him at the Christmas party. I hope the author continues writing more of the escapades of the Blackbird sisters, Mick and Spike."
3,Philadelphia society murder,"Nora Blackbird and her two sisters Libby and Emma are from a blue-blood, Philadelphia, upper-crust family. Unforunately their parents squandered the family fortune and left Nora with a large, but crumbling home and lots of debt. To offset some of her bills, Nora writes societyarticles for a local newspaper. While attending a fox hunt, Nora discovers that Rush Strawcutter was killed and her sister Emma was near him when he died. Emma becomes the #1 Suspect and Nora sets out to exonerate her sister. There are some amusing moments in the book, but basically the plot seems to be a murder investigation strung together with parties and other social events which Nora covers for her newspaper. This gets to be a little tedious after awhile and does not really justify 310 pages of reading. Also, Nora's dog Spike is not as funny as he needs to be in order to break the tedium of the rest of the book."
5,The Case of the 3 Little Blackbirds,"A great mystery with well developed characters and ""cozy"" murders among friends and neighbors. I've read the first three books and am anxiously awaiting the next installment of the 3 off beat, but engaging sisters, who fancy themselves black widows."
5,Yoga fun time,I am a kindergarten teacher and I do these poses with my class. They do love them plus it is a good healthy workout for them--and me!
3,Good but poor sound quality,My kids love to do yoga; the quality of the video and sound wasn't great but a fun video nevertheless.
2,yoga dvd,"It was just ok. It wasn't incredibly engaging for my three children (ages 5, 5, & 7). I don't know what I expected, but it just seemed a little amateur in production quality and the teacher wasn't particularly motivating."
5,Great Yoga video for kids & beginning adults!,I bought this video so that my 3 year old & I could do a relaxing activity together while my 1 year old napped. I love Nancy Wile! She has a soothing voice and does poses that are not too hard and does not change poses too fast. My 3 year old joins in every now and then and I am hoping he will try more as he gets older. I would highly recommend this video!!
1,Not worth the money,"Bought this for my active three year old who is enrolled in dance, gymnastics and swim class thinking that she would enjoy doing this at home. Well it kept her attention for maybe five minutes. The sound quality is poor. It sounds like it was filmed in a basement, which it probably was. I would not recommend this to any one and should have saved my money."
3,Ok for the price,Easy to put together. It would work great if the cross member that supports your knees had alot more padding. Maybe use square tubbing and padded plywood to distribute the weight across your knees. And the glue that's used for the foot pad sucks. As soon as I started using it they started to slide off. Put for the price it's ok
1,Short changed on toner,Cartridge was advertised as 4000 page capacity. Received 1500 pages. Will not buy from Amazon again.
2,One of my least favorite travel books,"I am an avid reader of travel books and travel quite a lot. This book was not helpful to me at all for my up-coming trip to Argentina. It was difficult to follow or locate places to visit. Also, the websites listed frequently did not ""work"". I wish I had my money back!"
4,An engrossing read,"I found this book made me feel quite intensely. The language was very real -- after I got through a few points in the first chapter that seemed to try too hard, in terms of phrasing, vocabulary, and setting up for the remainder of the book. After the first chapter, I found myself picking it up whenever I could fit it in during my vacation, despite all of the temptations of a vacation in New Orleans! I highly recommend it!"
4,I Really Enjoyed This Book!!!!!,"It was good to relive alot of my childhood just readng this book. It had my attention and I look forward to his new material. Much Luv, From Sistahs With A Vision"
2,this book is in need of a 'service pack',"This book contains some useful, though poorly presented information. This book attempts to be a tutorial, but often reads more like an encyclopedia. I would not recommend this book until it has been fixed."
3,"Good board, but.....","Very nice board just like the pictures and description, but it appears that they forgot to do a finish sanding of their product. I hit it with 150 grit sandpaper then followed with 220 grit to get it to the smoothness that I had expected. Kind of a pain if you know what I mean."
2,"Euros, please.","An edition from 1994 is really a bit outdated for Business German. Remember, in Germany, one cannot exchange currency in a bank since 2010. Does an edition from the 1990's explain that?"
2,Sam the Sea Cow,"Product reviewBook was suppose to be in hardcover, however we receieved a soft cover."
2,waaaay overrated,"C'mon people, LHP isn't that great, heck it isn't even particularily good. ""Clandestine"", ""Wolverine Blues"" and ""Morning Star"" are much better because on those albums Entombed actually cared to write songs. LHP offers unfocused riffage wrapped by muddy production. All the songs are UNDISTINGUISHABLE. There's nothing memorable about this album. People too often equal historical influence with quality (Led Zeppelin anyone?). It just doesn't work that way."
3,Not bad London gangster novel,"Three young Police recruits are put deep undercover to get close to a key target ( a 'Tango One' as they are called). The story then switches to the Tango One in question as his world starts to fall apart and eventually the characters all link up.Actually not bad, Leather has written some good thrillers and this one moves at a fair pace and does have some unexpected twists.Not sure if it is worth the investment of a hardback but worth a look when in paperback."
5,A very good introductory book,"This textbook introduces the basics of asset pricing theory and portfolio optimization at a level suitable to advanced undergraduates. The mathematics seems to be just right for practitioners: no martingales, no girsanov theorem, but a complete treatment of binomial lattices and a semi-quantitative introduction to diffusion processes and to stochastic calculus. Problems are very well chosen. The organization of the text is standard, except for the last two chapters, related to optimal growth portfolio and to real options. Final remark: the book is excellent for self-study. I learnt the subject from Prof. Luenberger himself, and he was repeating each single word from the book, saying (as a disclaimer) that ""it's not me copying the book... it's the book that copies what I said. After all, I wrote it."" Needless to say, the class was excellent."
3,Useful,"I have read the book and used several of his strategies. I don't think it is anything revolutionary, but if you have never givien a seminar before I would highly recommend it. I like the way he gives you a strategy of how to get the most out of the seminar. For example, creating a feeding frenzy at the end to maximize your leads. I also like his strategy for setting up the room. After several different styles I have chosen the U formation and his insights helped me come to that conclusion."
4,"The Scoop on Planning, and Executing Seminars","The is an excellent resource for Stock Brokers and Financial Planners when preparing seminars. Not doing seminars? You should! A successful professional needs multiple sources of prospects. As cold-calling becomes more difficult due to caller ID and call blocking, seminars are increasing in importance. Good resource!"
1,Worthless!,"Compared to Fred Gleeck's book this is an ABSOLUTE JOKE. This guy lives in an ivory tower. Fred Gleeck lives and works in the real world. Buy Fred's book, NOT this one!"
2,UP 119 Train,"I did not like the size. It said HO on the box but it was as small as an ""N"". I was very disapointed."
5,Read this book!,"In this revelatory, revolutionary book, UCLA professor Donald Shoup persuasively explains why almost everything we are told about parking either by professional planning experts or by ""common sense"" is wrong, and argues that current parking policies constitute the greatest planning disaster in human history. This book should be required reading for every mayor, city council member, urban planner, traffic engineer, and every citizen who is concerned with traffic issues, making cities and towns more livable, or mitigating the damage we've caused by paving over the earth."
4,The End of Free Parking,"The author makes many good arguments against providing free parking for motorists. The basic premise is that everyone pays for the parking anyway - just not directly. The expense is in the cost of rent or goods sold so everyone pays for it indirectly.While free parking is viewed by most motorists as a birth right, it has been a primary cause of unattractive an inefficient development patterns. Since drivers don't pay directly for parking there is no incentive to drive less and walk, bicycle or take mass transit more.This lengthy book is most likely to attract planners and parking professionals. Its got a lot of good information and many references to back up the hypotheses. Its not exactly a page turner."
3,Hit or Miss,"This collection of videos from an excellent band called Low out of Duluth, Minnesota is a hit-or-miss effort. Some of the videos are quite good, but others seem amateurish, relying heavily on stock footage. The poorer videos are especially disappointing, since the music is outstanding. ""Over the Ocean,"" which has the band performing under an indoor storm of falling debris, is probably the best video. But the highlight of the tape has to be an appearance by pro-wrestling's Baron von Rashke in the video for ""Shame."""
5,Nastee' is going to have the industry on lock.,"I also live in the Go-Ill along with Bigg Nastee' and I am definitely feelin' him with all of his lyrics especially on it done been one and ghetto cousins. Nastee' felt that he had to be the don of this rap game, and he came out strong to prove it. I just hope that mercury and all the other labels involved with his project push him enough and have enough promotion behind him so that not only Chicago knows of him, because is album is hot. That's what's up."
4,Captivating book,I was truly amazed by this one man's journey. He shares his thoughts in a very down to Earth fashion. Having Randall share his story gave me great hope. I am sharing this book with others joyfully! His efforts are a wonderful contribution to our world! Spread the word! A must read for anyone searching for answers to the creation of possibilities in their lives.
2,CHEESY...but,"Yes the movie was cheap, and yes it was kind of pointless & unrealistic, but Billy Zane made it worth while. He looked HOT in this movie (not that that's important) and his acting was good, not his BEST, but good! Its a change to see him play this type of role rather than a crazy/jerk/bad guy or whatever... If your not a fan of Billy Zane, or low budget movies then I wouldn't expect too much out of this one...Overall, I wouldn't pay 9 bucks for it, go rent it!!!"
1,Poor quality,"It was a boring presentation of a great talented Cuban singer. No comentary, no color, all in b&w, with lots of old good songs. No concert however and no reaction from the audience, I gave the tape away in Cuba, to an old fan of Benny More."
5,I love this bracelet!,"Every time I wear this bracelet someone asks me where I bought it. The hinge makes it easy to put on and it is standing up great considering I have a very active granddaughter who loves to ""admire"" it!"
1,Poor qualitiy,"This bracelet was a Christmas gift for a 68 yr. old lady and after whe wore it 3 or 4 times, it broke half into. I am notifing seller for a return. We'll see happens."
2,no wheel plugs or removal tool,My daughter told me all her friends have the tool to remove the wheels and the covers that go over the holes when you take the wheels out. These didn't come with either. She was really bummed. If I had known that I would have never bought them.
2,Heelys bummer,we were not pleased with this product. There is no easy way to get the wheels out. Suppossedly there should be a tool to do this. It was not provided with this style.
2,???,"I honestly can not say anything other than this product does not work on new computers. If you have an old one, this may be great for you."
5,A Classic!,"This movie is a classic, particularly if you saw it during the early nineties when it was made. It hasn't lost any of it's poignancy, and may be even be more poignant today. It addresses problems of the early nineties which could easily be the problems of today. Not to mention, this movie ROCKS!!! If you haven't seen it you should."
5,favorite movie?,"This movie is awesome! I saw it many years ago while in high school. Whenever someone asks what my favorite movies are, it always makes the top 5. Very dramatic."
3,"Always loved this movie, the DVD is so-so.","Very basic video transfer on this DVD, to preserve the 16x9 framing, but the quality of the picture is not that great, and up-converting to does nothing to it as it has nothing to up-convert. Having said that, it actually looks OK and kind of works with the grime and grit of the story and the characters, that the image is not-so crystal clear as you might see on Blu-Ray. Still, what a great movie. This set the tone and feel for Hollywood's streets for the 90's."
4,Great early movie for up and coming actors,"This movie is full of actors that you now know at first glance. But when it came out, it was just a little movie full of a cast of actors with potential.It's a moving and engrossing charater study that goes over the top from time to time, but never makes you lose your interest. You care about all the characters, whether you like them or detest them, until after it's over, and you realize how sad their lives truly are. At that point, even the detestable characters evoke pathos.This definitely is a movie that film-lovers should see. If for no other reason, it's great to see the actors before they all broke (and to see the ones that didn't quite live up to potential). But above all, it's a film that deserves it just due, and it's viewing by more people."
4,Where This Movie Takes You,"With an all-star cast and a great premise, Where The Day Takes You takes a hard look at the lives of children on the streets of Hollywood. The cast includes such greats as Dermot Mulroney, Lara Flynn Boyle, Will Smith and Sean Astin, more recently of The Lord of the Rings Trilogy fame. Both realistic and unsettling, Where The Day Takes You is one movie that I am truly glad I took time to watch."
4,Looking forward to viewing this....,"I still haven't seen this, but am looking forward to at the right time. I read the reviews and it seems like it will be an eye-opener."
5,Where The Day Takes You,"Thank you for providing such quality products. My movie was in perfect condition and played with no problems. I will most definately order more movies in the future as well as search for other items that I'm looking to buy. Again, thank you for your service that you provide to people like me that is on a very fixed income. You make buying items possible where if you didn't exist I would be doing without.Sincerely,Barbara Gilbert"
1,Where the Day Takes You,"After about 10 minutes of viewing filthy language, I through this item in the trash can. Who knows if it had a good story line or not. The scenes kept confusingly switching back and forth, but still the filthy language remained. Would not recommend this movie for no one!!"
5,PLEASE DO NOT JUDGE BY THE COVER,The cover of this book defines the word cheezy which is truly sad because the story is pretty good. If you like futuristic or sci/fi romance then you will probably enjoy this book. Strong female lead and a unusual male lead. Definitely worth a read if your a Popp fan.
3,Okay but nothing special,Robin Popp is a fairly interesting writer. This is the first of her scifi that I have read. It was okay for a fast casual read.
4,As good as I remembered,"I first read some of the ""Jill"" books when I was a youngster, probably back in the early 1960's. I was horse crazy and even though I was a good reader, if a book didn't have a horse in it, I was not interested. I loved the Jill books by Ruby Ferguson because they felt so real to me! Even though I live in America, and Jill is in England, I felt she could be my best friend. These books are written in first-person, so you feel as if Jill is talking directly to you, telling you all about her experiences. Things go wrong, creative thinking helps er solve problems, and she even has some of the same prejudices that all of us have. Not to sickly sweet, but still right wins out in the end, like we all like to see happen in a good book.Even though these books were written long ago, young girls reading these books today would still enjoy them."
2,foods to prevent prostrate cancer,Recipes required a lot of ingredients which I did not readily have. Took a lot of work preparing the meals. Food didn't tast all that good.
2,Do not waste your money,The recipes are time intensive and many are tasteless. Health food does not deservice the bad rap.
1,Junk,"Don't know if it is the chipset or the manufacturer, but this board is junk. 1st arrived DOA. -- on the MB LCD. Did an RMA, got a replacement board which wouldn't recognize the EVGA 8800GT graphics card in slot 1. Moved to Slot 3, and got as far as the BIOS once or twice, but kept locking up - This is with a tested 800watt SLI PS, Quad core intel cpu, and one stick of PC2 6400 RAM sitting on the box - bare minimum install - EVGA support agreed it sounded like another bad board and offered to send a 3rd board. No Thanks, returned to Amazon for a refund, and ordered a GIGABYTE GA-P35-DS4. Maybe try SLI another day, for now going for stability. I hope I have better luck with their graphics card."
5,GOOD BUT It; it did not work at first needed rma,"I bought it, worked fine, than pci express brige went and took the ram controllers with it, sent back got new one now it works fine"
5,One tight mobo,I just got this thing in the other day. Installed it in a Cooler Master 690 case. Fastened my Intel Quad Core Q6600 with 4 gig of ram and 8800 GT video card. The Zalman 9700 heatsink fits nicely. What can I say this thing screams.
5,Best board in it's class.,"Great board, good price, easy to overclock; what's more to say.If your looking for the end all be all, this board is it as far as I'm concerned!Core 2 Duo E6750 overclocked to 3.6 and will go more, 2 XFX 8600GT XXX in sli. Will play any game, and it's fast! If your serious about gaming this will do it at a good price! Amazon is the best."
1,a waste of time,"Beware of this mobo. Like other poster said, it will waste more hours than anyone should care to waste. I don't even overclock and I can't keep this mobo running for more than 3 days straight without having it to start flaking out memory wise. Also, if you unplug power to board and replug it in (cold boot), this thing will give you C1 posting errors (which can be recovered actually without RMA'ing board if you're skilled). But honestly, this board must have some serious hardware defects. Constant issues that never seem to be fixed with latest BIOS updates. I suspect there's some sort of voltage problems with this board, but who knows...many theories on the EVGA boards."
2,Chipped dish,Disappointed. One bowl in the set was chipped. I had to return the set. I would reorder if they had more available.
4,Well done,This book gave some very good insights into the business of making and selling candles. And I think it is a useful book to have for anyone who wishes to support thier hobby.
2,Technical Problems,"I agree with other reviewers concerning the technical problems for this release. I, too, tried twice to obtain good copies, not believing that Naxos or Dynamic would release such prints.However, I had gone one step further. I have contacted Naxos directly. They have been most forthright. I do not believe that they were aware of the problems. They have informed me that they are contacting the principle vendors/producers and will rectify the problems.I also agree that the production is more than confusing. But then I am not Russian/Slavic and, perhaps, the gestures, sets, etc. mean something symbolic. Anyhow, it is the ONLY DVD performance we have so, once the technical difficulties are resolved, I will purchase a copy."
1,do not touch this production with a broom stick,"The production is horrible. All the Russian national, local color and flavor are totally absent. The stage is littered with toy-like objects and symbols, ludicrous and ugly. So are the costumes.Russia is portrayed as a bowl of swarming and moving lice. Very good singing and acting do not help the production. The best part of this purchase is the disc box, unusually well made."
3,Quite good...,"But not the best of Rimsky-Korsakov, this version is not flawless...There are many mistakes...The stage is a bit regular, the singers are just ok. Low budget production.Martin"
1,Full of mistakes.,"I read the other reviews before buying this book, but because I had heard some great reviews about the Black Book, I decided to try it anyway. I should have listened to the other reviews. I think it would be a really good book if the examples were not full of errors."
1,The worst... most frustrating... waste of money... errors,This book has to be the most carelessly written book considering its intended readership.The reader should not have to contend with code that is incorrect. Learning VB is difficult enough without the frustration of feeling like you are being sabotaged by the authors.This book is a nightmare. I take back my 1 star.
2,"Yes, it's bad, but....","Even though this book is filled with errors in the printed code, it still has much to show about programming in Access. The Coriolis web site has an errata area for the corrections, and the CD seems to have the correct code for the examples I have looked at. I don't recommend this for a beginner, but, after I looked past the errors, the content is fine. Also, the author has posted an apology for the errors, so I hope the next edition (if it makes it) will be correct."
1,Yuck!!!!,"Yet another desicration of Beatles music to line Micheal Jackson's pockets. Why can't they just hire someone to write little songs for babies? It's not like the kid came and said why I think that I would like to listen to a crappy remake of the Beatles this evening.Kids should stick to Raffi, leave the greatest band of all time's music alone!!"
1,BIG BAD BOB SPEAKS,"This album stinks worse than a diaper full of digested Gurbers strained carrots. I say babies should hear the Beatles at full strength! A little ""Helter Skelter"" at ear-splitting volume is a crucial learning experience for the young or old! Imagine legions of pre-schoolers chanting ""NUMBER NINE,NUMBER NINE, NUMBER NINE....."
2,hilarious and ridiculous,"Of course the originals are far better! Of course they sound somewhat silly without singing! Of course you won't listen to it very often! Of course it is Beatle music molesting!However, it is NOT child abuse. It shows that these silly musical boxes can play real music and make it sound almost real. Definitely not for the faint of heart die hard Beatle fan, but hey! if you love the Beatles you'll want anything anyhow....."
4,Beatles for Babies...,"I first heard this CD in a novelty shop about 3 years ago. Later, when I had a new little one, this was the first album we went searching for. Our 2 year old loves this music and has been listening to it every day for the last 18 months. The tunes are Beatles, but the style is definetly lullaby. If you are expecting rock n roll sounds, skip it. But if you want soothing music with a familiar tune, try this on your babies!"
1,too short,"Collar was far less than 20 usable inches -- measured less than 20"" from buckle to tip. Construction appeared durable, but was too short for my dogs."
5,Beautiful,If you enjoy Cowboy music with a Celtic flare don't miss Prickly Pair. And the fiddle playing is first rate.
2,Won't work with my Phone,I have tried to get this headset to work with my phone but it won't work. I am using the Panasonic Link to Cell. It is not a bluetooth headset. The merchant I used wouldn't let me return the headset. Very dissatisfied with this product and the merchant.
4,Funhouse-Good Times version,"This review is for Funhouse on Good Time's dvd and not by what appears to be a studio version of the film. Good Times is a company that releases cheap dvds and sometimes the picture is not always the best. Halloween 2 for example on Good Times dvd was bad. This is why I want to make sure people know the difference. I bought the studio version and the seller sent me the good time version and I said ""Oh crap"", yet the film is fine and the picture is good.The Funhouse has an excellent atmosphere. The opening credits are creepy and im not even afraid of carnivals. The film follows a good plot and I enjoyed it overall. Not alot of gore but the carnival is creepy enough, isnt it? I'm surprised they did not make a sequel to this film."
5,The Secret Lives Of Carnies...,"I've always known that carnies are creepy! THE FUNHOUSE proves just how nefarious they truly are! Four 25yo ""teens"" decide to spend the night in the carnival funhouse. All is well until they witness a murder! Now, these ""kids"" must fight for survival against the carnival barker and his hideously-mutated son! I consider FUNHOUSE to be one of Tobe Hooper's better films, right along side of his TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE and POLTERGEIST. It's basic, straight-forward plot gets right down to business. If you like Hooper's films, then this one belongs in your collection..."
3,A Movie I Wanted To Love,"I love horror movies from the 1980s, but I was a little disappointed with this film. Tobe Hooper is a great director but this movie just dragged in too many places. The first half of the film was dull, but almost makes up for it from middle to end (almost). The monster isn't scary but the make up is really good and the creature itself is memorable. I remember watching this movie years ago and the thing I remember about the movie is the monster. Overall to me, this movie is worth watching once but I don't think I could sit through it again."
5,No one escapes the Funhouse!,"This movie is awesome. This movie defines exactly what horror was during the late 70's and early 80's. Tobe Hooper directed an instant classic with this one. The movie follows a small group of teens who decide to camp out one night inside the local carnival's funhouse ride. Once inside the ride they realize that the ride's operators are less than desirable. Now that they have become trapped inside the attraction, they must formulate a plan to stay alive and hopefully get out. Every single time I hear about or see a carnival I think of this movie. Remember what ""Jaws"" did for ocean goers? Funhouse did the same thing for carnival enthusiasts. Great horror film!"
2,Rather disappointing,"My best friend and I first discovered the book when going through some old stuff left behind by her sisters when they moved out. We both really loved the book. Then one day we discovered the movie at a rental store, we were really excited when we realized it was based on the book. I can't tell you how disappointed we were. We didn't even finish watching it. If I hadn't previously read the book I don't think I would have known what was going on. I gave it two stars because maybe my expectations were too high after reading the book."
1,L--A--M--E,"This had to be one of the worst so-called slasher flicks ever made. The acting was non-existent, it wasn't scary in the least (except maybe to a 6-year-old), and the four ""victims"" were so stupid and/or useless (your boyfriend's in a fight with another guy who was planning on killing you, so what do you do? Don't try to help; oh, no. Just stand there and scream like an idiot)you almost wanted tehmall to die. A waste of almost 2 hours and God knows how many brain cells..."
3,Pretty good horror film- 3.5 stars,"Funhouse was directed by TObe Hooper , same guy who directed the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. This is in noway as good as TCM but it is a good horror film. I admire Tobe's directing. The movie is about 4 kids who go to a carnival and sneak into a funhouse on a dare. They encounter a freak and his father or master and the freak trys to kill em all, they are locked in the funhouse. This reminded me a little bit of texas chainsaw massacre only in the sense that they had the freak who acted like leatherface , who cowared when the master or father came home ( back to the funhouse). The begining scenes of the freaks from the funhouse and dolls were creepy and so was the atmosphere but like i said this in noway compares to the masterpiece tcm. It is worth owning though if your a horror fan."
4,Family values!,"Learn--the way you invariably do when watching horror movies from this era--what evils await young people who don't listen to their parents, experiment with drugs, have sex, etc. As in Hooper's classic ""Texas Chainsaw,"" there's another family, too: this time, the misfits and freaks at the carnival. Nothing groundbreaking, but the creaking gears of carny contraptions and neon haze really capture a creepy atmosphere."
2,They Tried,This movie well it was boosted up like it was something really great. It had its moments but man. It had its weak times too. The little monster in this movie was just screaming like a girl the whole movie and that was really annoying. You can check it out. I didn't like it too much though. Oh well thats my opinion. Maybe you can find some good in it.
1,movie was so dumb it didnt scare me,when i first seen this movie i thought it be scary but it turned out to be one of the most boring horror movies i seen so far. i seen alot of scary movies but i dont know which is worse. the storyline was really boring and i thought it didnt have enough scares in this one.
2,OVERrated by horror fans,"I don't get what the fuss is about with this one, to be honest. I found it incredibly slow and not worth all of the boring parts once the action starts. It takes the characters almost an hour to get into the funhouse in the first place. On the plus side, the acting is pretty good for a flick like this. The character of the little brother winds up being pointless. It just seemed mis-directed and lame. And I'm not decrying the lack of gore. I am not a gorehound. I just thought it was all set-up and little follow-through."
3,Time passer?,"I don't know, maybe I just had my expectations set too high but I thought this movie would be a lot scarier... And more realistic at a certain ... But yeah, either way, it was good enough to keep on and not change. But I thought with a setting like this, it had the potential to be piss-in-your-pants scary. lol"
3,half and half,"The first half of this movie is brilliant. You have all the ingridients of a classic horror flick: the oblivious parents, the bratty little kid, the sweet virginal heroine, the rebel boyfriend and the sidekicks;the best friend and the goofy guy. You also have a carnival that seems wrong from the minute the kids arrive. Everything moves on a quick, suspense building pace until the second half. Once the monster chase is on the movie starts to slow down and by the time the ending came I didn't care anymore. Later I read the book and was shocked to see how much was left out of the movie. In this case the director should have hired his screen writer and stuck with the novel."
4,Looking for an outstanding horror flick ?,"Welcome to ""The Funhouse"" ! Intensely directed by horror genius Tobe Hooper, this frightening flick has absolutely everything you could possibly ask for ! A scary atmosphereric look, gruesome special effects by Rick Baker, and suspense galore,make this one a winner ! This film also proves that you don't need graphic violence to make a movie scary. Check it out !!"
4,THIS MOVIE WILL LITERALY SCARE THE HELL OUT OF YOU,"As 4 teenagers go to the carnival looking to have a good time, they got more than they bargained for. As one by one they are brutally murdered. You'll see all sort of freaks in this movie , which just add to to its bizzare and twisted setting. I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves to have the day lights scared out of them !!!"
4,decent b flick,"good b flick movie. not as great as others but definitely amusing. remember, it is a b movie so it has that style."
3,good and a half,"If you like lower budget 1980s horror, you'll like Funhouse.A teenage girl is being spied on, first by baby brother, than at a local carnival fun house where she goes on a double date.I won't reveal more plot, but Funhouse is highly enjoyable: a horror film that works on more suspense and fun thrills than violence and gore. This was very early in the Reagen decade, and the film feels more like the late 1970s in style-jocks with collar length hair, a little nudity, a damsel with long straight black locks in distress.It probably won't scare you, but might make you jump. Even if it does not, as a timepiece, Funhouse is in fact a lot of fun"
3,Dissapointing,"Compared to Texas Chainsaw Massacre, this movie is like watching a kitten play with a ball of string. I think it is one of the more overrated horror movies of the 80s and is simply put high on lists because Tobe Hooper directed it. The main problem with Funhouse is that it is simply not scary and none of the deaths are very memorable or creative. That being said, this was not completely horrible. The production quality is relatively high for an 80s horror flick. Watch this only if you are a huge Tobe Hooper fan, there are simply better options out there."
3,A HORROR FILM THAT TAKES PLACE INSIDE A DARK RIDE!,"It is hard to not like any film that takes place inside a dark ride. This is a classic monster on the loose tale with some nice atmosphere. It is slow at times and there are some ""dumb dumb"" moments,but isn't that always the case in these kind of movies? Tobe Hooper has done better,but a creepy trip through this dark ride never bothers me. It would be nice to see a better DVD treament for this film,but at least it is available."
4,Wonderfully creepy!,"The set of this movie is the carnival. Nearly all the lighting is natural, which means it comes from the lights at the carnival and the atmosphere in which it was shot.This is a creepy and fun movie based upon the novel of the same name.Highly recommended."
3,"""Let's spend the night...in the funhouse!""","Tobe Hooper updates his theme from ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" by having four luckless teens spend the night in the carnival funhouse, where they get more than they bargained for. The funhouse proprietors are very strange - even for a carnival - and before long the group is battling evil they don't understand. Not a bad one from director Hooper. Great atmosphere, plenty of suspense and scares, and realistic teen characters. Hooper occasionally apes his earlier films, and rips off both ""Halloween"" and ""Psycho"" - both in the opening sequence! But all in all a neat but overlooked frightfest."
3,Twisted and Scary,"Now this may be a Holloween immatation but I really believe after viewing this movie that this is one of the most twisted scariest movies that I have ever seen. Right from the beginning the movie has a unright feeling to it you can't really explain the spook you get when you watch it. The first hour is pretty light and is the start of things in the movie where you meet all the teenagers and the freaks who run the carnivals, then the last hour of the movie gets wierd when they sneak into the funhouse and thats the true spook of the movie. If you want to be scared just watch this all by yourself in the dark late at night I guarantee you won't be able to turn the tv off because of the fear that this film will bring you. Very low budget but again low budget movies are sometimes better than the 1 million dollar thrillers."
2,Follow the money,"Anyone reading this book needs to consider that the editor, Christopher Phelps, has a lucative contract selling this edition along with Bedford/St. Martin's textbooks. Phelps shamelessly promotes this edition, claiming that it is the only legitimate edition of The Jungle. He relies on statements by Upton Sinclair, which are of dubious value, while ignoring the unbiased testimoney of Frank Doubleday in his Memoirs of a Publisher (1972)."
2,"I wasn't that fond of it, but it had a few good elements.","I have only read through chapter 20 and I don't like it. Our teacher gave us a list to read from and I chose The Jungle not knowing what a bore I was in for. I thought that Sinclair dragged out everything more than it needed to be. Somethings do need extra explaining, but he gave it to almost everything. I can see how some people might like that, but I don't. It's not much of a review, but that's pretty much how I feel."
3,Walking With Freedom - A Hike Along the Appalachian Trail,The DVD was just OK. The music was great. It was just a home movie quality with a lot of handheld jumpy shots. He tended to complain quite a bit in the show about the conditions. The good parts were interviewing other hikers and the soundtrack. I thought Appalachian Impressions was a better and more informative DVD.
4,Best I've seen on this topic,"I thru-hiked in '02 (Hopfrog) and have seen a few of the videos out there. I feel this one does the best job of capturing what its like out there on the AT. At one point Lion King seems to have an epiphany and speaks to the camera about how wonderful his experience is and how it fixes ya. Its worth viewing for that moment alone as he really captured the feeling a lot of us got hit with out there. I did feel the film taper off towards the end and it seemed to me that Lion King was getting more into ""hiking his hike"" than making a film. I can certainly understand that. If your looking for a video that will give you a feel for what it is like out there, I'd highly recommend this film."
4,Watched it over and over,"I've watched this movie at least 4 times since purchasing it in May. Videography is good. Sountrack is excellent (hope that a soundtrack is released on CD soon). Michael ""Lion King"" Daniel does a good job of letting the viewer know the struggles and emotions that a long distance hiker can and often does encounter. Recommended to anyone considering such a hike. Also a nice reflective film for those who have already hiked all or part of the AT."
3,Nice Enough,"This double disc collection of downtempo cuts is perfectly pleasant; although, when listened to from one end to the next, it unfortunately falls into that catagory of ""lo-fi"" collections that lacks enough personality to keep you from relegating it to background noise after the first half hour or so. When you tune back in, you'll probably like what you hear well enough, but not enough to go back and see what you may have missed.I mostly recommend this if you can find a copy on sale. If not, you won't have missed anything that you couldn't afford to.Rating: C+"
5,AT&T 2-Line Switch (White),"Everything works fine, but why did they stop making them? I had to find my third used on E-Bay."
4,Interactive and well made,"This book is a favorite with my almost three-year-old. It is a simple going to bed story, but has movable parts and clever inserts that involve children as the process unfolds. It hits all the high points, such as cleaning up and brushing teeth, and the slots and tabs are very well done -- pushing the ""towel"" in the right place changes the ""soap in the eyes"" face to a smiling one. I would suggest supervision with younger readers, though -- I'm ordering another copy to take the place of our battered, beloved first one!"
2,On our 2nd copy,"I'm having to buy a second copy of this book because the 6 year old is upset that her toddler sister has ripped some of the pockets. While it's clearly geared to younger children, my older one has a strong sentimental attachment to it, which speaks of its impact on kids. It's very simple, but the action/reaction component of the book make it more than just a pop-up book. Surprisingly, most of the the pieces remained with the book for a couple of years (much to my surprise), but now the little one is making quick work of it. Needless to say, it's great at bedtime."
5,A hit....,"I picked up this book (as well as many others) for my now 10 month old daughter. I try to keep all of her books simple at this point, but no matter what book I try to show and read to her...this is the one she always goes for! No other book in her collection keeps her interest through the end. It's amazing how quietly she will sit as she watches me turn the pages, pull the tabs, and move the inserts. I have to read this book atleast three times at each sitting. Sometimes I even have to hide it, so that we can move on to something else! My daughter highly recommends this one!!!!!!"
5,what the ... is a Taxi boy?,"The real kids 2nd album plus the BOMP e.p on one disc you can't go wrong.I prefer the taxi boys e.p though because it isn't as overproduced as the real kids album and rocks much harder.I just read on the net that these guys just played n.y.c and the new line-up has Billy Cole[slaw] on geetar, B- Face on bass,Jimmy Cunningham[No relation to richie] on the skins And of course ""Hippy"" Johnny Felice .If these guy's can keep it together and go into the studio, record and produce it themselves they will have a top selling album {c.d} for 2003.Hope to see it and please put WHO NEEDS YA on it."
2,history,"shipping time agreeable, DVD content not what i expected. If I had to do it all over again, I would not have purchased this DVD."
3,Amina Birkett (South Africa),As a final year student in History and Anthropology I have found this documentary extremly useful and would recommend it to anyone even if they are not history or anthropology students. It also gives on a view from the other side. I have also recommended this to my lecturer and he may get the other sudents to watch some clips from this.
3,not really sayin anything,this movie is ok but its not teachin anything it doesnt tell you sny history really and it just get borning in some parts but it ok to watch if you wont to know some of the problems people fce daily
4,A must see!,"I would recommend people of color view this young and older, especially impressionable teens. Contain a lot of teachable moments."
3,"Nero, Fendi Mamma Zucchino","Bag arrived fast, but was returned due to misrepresentation on the internet. It appeared scratched like it was scraped across the floor and did not appear as a true Fendi bag like on eluxury. I appreciate the full refund that was given."
2,Terrible Spray Function!,"The tanning oil itself is fine, with a nice smell and texture. However, the ""continuous spray"" bottle works poorly if at all! Usually, the first time I depress it, some lotion comes out, but the spray peters out quickly, and subsequent attempts at using the bottle barely even get lotion to trickle out! This would be much better in a lotion form or even just a tradition spray design."
3,Toe Fat - 'Toe Fat / Toe Fat II' (Beat Goes On) 2-CD import,"Another worthy title from the UK label Beat Goes On. I've seen old vinyl lp's of Toe Fat around in used record stores, but this was the first time I've listened to their material, on this 2-CD reissue. Here,you get both their lp's, the self-titled 'Toe Fat' ('70) and 'Toe Fat II' ('71). Had NO idea of their line-up, which was two pre-Uriah Heep members keyboardist/vocalist Ken Hensley and drummer Lee Kerslake. To round it out,their bassist was one-time Tull member John Glascock. Toe Fat,as it turns out is really good blues rock.Some of the tracks that I thought sort of stood out were ""Bad Side Of The Moon"",""But I'm Wrong"",""Indian Summer"" and the rocking ""Three Time Loser""(perhaps a theme song for some?).Do check it out if you can."
1,OLD and Terrible,"Put it this way HORRIBLE..The start of URIAH HEEP...Love Uriah Heep,,but sadly dissappointed.."
5,Small but packed with laughter,"I received this as a Christmas present and was suprised at how tiny it is. Only 127 pages long and it measures just about 3X3! However this small package is packed with Muppet takes on classic Christmas carols (Please Rest Ye Grumpy Gentlemen), stories (The Thrift of the Magi), Muppet letters to Santa and illustrated with charming photos of the Muppets in various Christmas settings. It's sure to bring joy and delight to children as well as adults!"
1,I'm sorry I wasted my money on this book,"An incomplete, factually inaccurate overpriced farce of a book"
5,Wish I'd read this book 5 years earlier!,"A quick read...I couldn't put it down. Excellent book which help me understand my wife (and myself) better. It gives some useful ""techinques"" to improve communication on difficult topics. If you are at an impass in your relationship due to issues related to abuse, but you love the person deeply, this book can help you break through. Everyone's story is different, but you'll think its written just for you...good to know you're not alone. Abuse doesn't just effect the survivor!"
3,great fitting tall boot,"Boot fit very well, more for a casual look. Returned as boot did not look as good as anticipated with casual skirts."
5,What All Beginning Directors Cannot Be Without,"Dean and Carra's FUNDAMENTALS OF PLAY DIRECTING is a step-by-step manual which deciphers the major technical and visual issues of stage directing. It includes specific ""tricks of the trade"" which remind all directors, beginning or advanced, of the mechanics of stage work. While the authors discuss dramatic theory, the book corrects examines technique, addressing the key concepts of stage focus, framing, stage pictures, and the creation of dynamism on the stage. It allows current students of directing to understand the ""fundamentals"" first in order to create new and exciting works later. Though expensive, it is the definitive text for directing students. FUNDAMENTALS OF PLAY DIRECTING is an important investment in a young director's theatrical future."
5,Great intro to CMM,"If you need to understand the CMM, this is the book for you. Don't look for this book to justify why your organization should use the CMM, there are other sources for that.And despite what ""James McGovern"" claims, the CMM is backed up by several years of real world use. Over 1000 organizations in 19 countries have used the CMM. Many companies, large and small, use it. My company has mandated it as a corporate goal."
5,Well done book that promotes understanding,"I like the way Kenneth makes it easy to understand the CMM. You'd be surprised at the misconceptions that abound about what the CMM is and how it's supposed to be used. This book should clear up the misconceptions while explaining what it takes to attain increasing levels of capability maturity. For those who do not know that the CMM is (hence the widespread misconceptions), it's a measurement of how mature a software development organization is that is based on processes and practices. It is NOT a methodology and does not compete with them. I have found that those who have never taken the time to read the literature are those who scream about how bad the CMM is. This book will clarify that."
4,A Good Guide for Understanding the CMM,"If you just get started for CMM Level 2, this is a good book for you to understand the Model. It explains all the KPAs with lots of graphics. I found it help in defining Level 2 processes, as it shows how all the KPAs in each CMM Level link together."
2,Write your own history,"Dr. Waite basically concludes ""if you don't like history, just make something up."" He dodges the fact that the Hebrew that the KJV relies on (Masoretic Text) is much later than than the Septuagint and sometimes is corrupt (Psalms 50/51 and 21/22 are good examples). The Septuagint predates the Masoretic by at least 700 years, and was the accepted version of the Old testament until the Protestant reformation.Don't get me wrong, I like the KJV, and some of his attacks on modern versions are founded. But he completely distorts history to prove his points. Many people have used his ideas as a test of loyalty to Christ -- ""If it ain't KJV, it ain't Bible"" a bumper sticker says."
1,Should be a NO STAR rating available!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Don't let the positive reveiws fool you. Originally the KJV came with a disclaimer because the translaters had trouble translating it. The essence of the disclaimer was ""here it is, we had a little trouble translating it, so you might not want to take our word for it."" Besides the NRSV is closer to the ancient Greek than the KJV could ever be. I recommend everyone get themselves a copy of (The Orthodox Study Bible: also available from amazon.com)"
2,Pick another brush,"Base is extremely lightweight. Whenever you want to pick this sucker up you have to either hold the base down or wedge it against your vanity w/your foot as you lift up or you're going to get the base every time. Also, don't pick white. I couldn't replace this thing fast enough. Eventually found a base w/sea shells & water & such in it at the hardware store. Sexy. The brush now resides in that. The brush is a brush. Tough on poops. The caddy, well just order one w/a better base."
2,KLH dvd221,"This player had trouble reading some dvd's that I rent. Even those that look perfectly fine and that play fine on my computer. It will not read DVD+R/RW or CD-R/RW. When a DVD is recognized and works, the picture quality is fine. I can't depend on the player to read DVD's that I rent, so I am looking for a different player."
2,Don't buy KLH,"This was my first dvd player. It lasted about 20 months before it died. It was OK for the first year and a half, but it paused and skipped more than I would have liked. It also took too long to start back up after I paused it. The picture and sound were good; but, since there are other brands out there at very similar prices, there is no reason to buy KLH."
5,Great Buy,This has been a great soldering station for an amateur solderer. I use it for tinkering with my motorcycle electronics and it's really fast to heat up and it doesn't take up much space! The sponge sucks...but you should get a brass one anyways!
4,Ok for the price,"Pros:PriceHeats quicklyStation and holder have a solid look and feelCons:C only - no F displayIron doesn't fit in holderInstruction manual isn't the greatestNo info at manufacturers websiteBack edge of iron is rough and unfinished with stress marks in the plastic from production.The holder is probably the worse of all of the items I listed as cons. It looks nice, the steel base makes it feel sturdy but the iron just doesn't sit in the holder correctly. I took a file to the inside and ended up snapped one of the ears off the base attempting to get the iron to sit correctly - still no luck. I'm afraid I'll either have to get out the big guns or just throw it away and use a different holder.P.S. The small diameter white piece with wires coming out of one end appears to be a replacement element/sensor. It took me a bit to figure that out since it wasn't labeled at all and I ordered other items at the same time."
4,Good soldering station,"Good station, only issue with it is really that the temperature resets to 200F after every powercycle."
4,Good product and nice price,"There are a lot of soldering stations out there and it's hard to find a good unit at an affordable price. This unit has digital heat settings, it heats very quickly (perhaps 30 seconds to 360 degrees) and it is designed to last. The soldering pen can be disconnected for storage or to repair or replace the ceramic heating unit. The product comes with an extra one included. It works very well on component level soldering that I do and I am happy with my choice."
4,nice soldering station,"I have not used it much yet but so far I like it. It heats quickly, maintains temperature well and the included tip will be great for SMD work. On the other hand, the buttons are clicky and always starts up at 200C (no DegF option). The stand fit well - no problem. Buy it!"
1,Not even used and broken,"I plugged it in and checked it out, later that day i tried to use it and it was broken..."
4,Aoyue 937+ Digital Soldering Station,Works great so far. I bought this unit to replace another unit almost like it. I have not used it but on one solder spot. I only hope it last longer than the one I replaced it with. Then I will be happy.
5,"so far, so good!","I just bought this item, so this isn't a long-term review. However, I have to say that I am VERY impressed with this soldering station thus far.The iron heats up quickly, and the led displays the actual temp of the iron. I had no trouble soldering some heavy gauge speaker wire with this, and no trouble soldering very fine gauge battery leads. This is a very powerful and versatile tool that should definitely be on the list for electronics people who are on a budget.The only drawback I've experienced is that the barrel of the iron gets warm (but not uncomfortably so). I think an extra bit of hi-temp foam should handle that problem.PS I'm am in NO WAY related to or associated with SRA, we just happen to have the same last name!"
4,A Great Iron for the Money,"I have a slightly older model at work - same part# but the newer one has venting holes in the shaft of the iron. The unit heats up very quickly and is fairly cool to handle.The included replacement heating element is a nice touch. I am still on the original one at work. The sponge included is very thin but I don't recommend using them anyway due to thermal shock stresses on the tip. get yourself a nice brass wire tip cleaner. Hakko makes a good one.When done using the unit, lower the temp to the lowest setting (200) and wait for it to reach that temperature before turning off. This will prolong the tip life. Also, before it cools off, apply some solder to the tip and let it harden on there to prevent oxidation.The only real grip is the iron holder - I would have liked to see that designed a little better. Something with a smoother entry to avoid tip damage."
3,"Good iron, poor handle.","I was impressed with this iron at first, good temperature stability, great price, but it wasn't long before the ceramic and tip section started separating from the rest of the handle. It really was not made to hold up to regular usage. I still need to modify the handle to keep it from flopping all over the place. Surface Mount devices can be tricky as it is, and a pencil that doesn't hold it position doesn't help. Aoyue will not be the brand of my next several ""higher end"" irons."
1,Great before it broke...,"When I first bought it I was impressed, It got to the operating temperature very quickly and maintained the temperature. However after three months of very light use (1/2 hour per week) the plastic nut that keeps the heating element in and attaches the tip to the body of the iron cracked. And sourcing a replacement seems to be difficult at best. In any case I wish I had spent the extra money for a Hakko or a Weller. I would not recommend this product."
1,returned it; iron doesn't seat probably,"you may notice that some reviews say the iron doesn't seat properly, and some that say it does seat properly. well i can honestly tell you that the one i received DID NOT seat properly. I tried everything and read all the reviews and look at all of the pictures. this thing is poorly designed, and if i were to keep this thing, it would have been dangerous as just brushing the wire ever so slightly could have cause it to fall out of the holster. like i said, maybe they aren't all like this, but the one that i received was definitely not usable."
2,The Ongoing Regurgitaion of Historical Dross,"I had to read this book for an advanced history class. If you want a good text book for the nineteenth century, this is your guide. But for anything but an index for the industrial revolution, this book is no different than reading binary code. It is a long string of useless facts about things minutely interesting or important to this time period. Granted, it does have some good information, and I applaud the author for his tenacity on sticking to writing this ticking brain tumor, this book is about as fun and interesting as poking myself with something rusty."
1,Version of Therese's writings heavily edited by her sister,"St. Therese of Lisieux's memoir, ""Story of a Soul,"" has set the world on fire. For more than fifty years after Therese's death, the only edition available had been heavily edited by Therese's sister Pauline, Mother Agnes of Jesus, who made about five thousand changes in the manuscript. Michael Day's translation is made from this edited manuscript.Happily, about 1956 the ""Manuscrits authentiques,"" Therese's original manuscripts, were released to the world, and in 1976 Fr. John Clarke, O.C.D. translated them in the book ""Story of a Soul: the autobiography of St. Therese of Lisieux,"" published by the Institute of Carmelite Studies. This is universally acknowledged as the only authentic and authoritative English translation. Mother Agnes's version remains of interest to scholars who wish to compare the two manuscripts, or to study the version which gave rise to the original cult of St. Therese."
2,"Okay, but Could Have Been Better","Mr. Sweeney rewards the patient reader with some good information about the 1911. However, he should have spent more time organizing his topic, hired a proof reader, and used a better spell checker. For example, the word ""form"" is consistently used instead of ""from."" Many other typos and grammar errors abound. This is a 336 page book with no index and the table of contents doesn't list the titles of the chapters.Some photos are used three or four times in different chapters to fill space, and some of the captions have no relationship to the photos. The book could use more pertinent photos and illustrations. For example, the author goes into detailed description of 1911 barrel anatomy but fails to provide a labeled illustration, leaving the non-expert reader confused and unable to follow.Could have been a much better book."
2,Disappinted with both Vol 1 & 2,"Volume 2 repeates much of what is in volume 1. Both volumes seem to assume that the reader only is interested in 1911s for competitionon. Every chapter relates its topic to competition and frequently repeats what was discussed in a previous chapter/volume. Seem to be more of an ""editroial"" than a reference guide."
5,Buy Both Books!,"This is Volume 2 of a two-book set. It has new performance evaluations and different upgrade and function tips... the first volume also has much more information about ammo and the basic function of the 1911... you really need both books to get all the information.For those who want to see a bad review of a gun, the author points out clearly that bad guns were shipped to him for review, if the gun didn't work he called the factory and returned the gun and told them to fix it. If they fixed it, he reviewed it. If they didn't he dropped the gun from the book saying it was not fair to put a bad review of a gun into a book that will stay in print for five or six years... the factory might fix the problem next year and the bad review would still be out there. All in all an excellent book, but like I said, buy both volumes."
2,colt book,I found this book to be a great cup place holder. I can't understand why this book was recommended but to each his own.
4,Much better than the first one,"Unlike Volume 1, this one was actually an interesting read, and the in-depth reviews of a multitude of different factory guns definitely makes one want to spend more money with ones local arms merchant."
3,Good book,"The book is a continuation of volume 1 which I liked, figured if volume 1 was good, volume 2 would be good, I wasn't disappointed."
1,BONK!!!,"If you like paying for advertising this is a must have.Even the table of contents was worthless since it only listed ""Chapter 1; Chapter 2"" and so on; never mind what the chapter is about. The front half has a few good tidbits but the back is a lot of ""I owe it to the gun manufacturer to say good things"" advertising reviews."
3,product works great...but...,"unfortunatly, i don't love the scent. it kinda reminds me of a gramma. i will not be purchasing again. but the oil does work very well and keeps the skin looking beautiful. i just can't get over the scent"
1,Fragrance is intense,"Gardenia is one of my favorite flowers because the fragrance is sweet and delicate. This product however is far from representing the natural fragrance. It is extremely strong almost like wearing an entire bottle of perfume at once. If you are looking for an oil with a hint or light fragrance, this is not the product for you. If you are looking for an oil that has an intense overpowering artificial scent, than you may like this product."
