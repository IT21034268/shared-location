1,As of 5/18/11 Check all 3 photos -- main photo is wrong,"Just a warning that the main photo for this item (showing 6 smaller pics of a u-shaped pillow) is not this actual item. The 2nd and 3rd photos are correct for the Snoogle, which is c-shaped. If you want the u-shaped pillow, you will need to order the Leachco Back 'N Belly - Contoured Body Pillow, which is $10 more. My star rating has nothing to do with the product itself...just want to alert others so you don't buy it based on the wrong photo, like I did!"
1,I'll just stick with my pillow arsenal,"I just didn't care for this at all. The head part was not high enough for me - I am a two pillow sleeper. The curve drove me batty because this pillow did not eliminate the need to toss and turn, just made it harder. Couldn't figure out the belly support feature - just didn't help me. Doesn't come with a case which is $20 and all in all I think just knowing I am sleeping on a $40 pillow makes me uncomfortable! I returned it the next day - just not worth it. I'll stick with my pillow arsenal - it's not ideal but it's free and works just as well as this."
2,Not so comfortable or easy to use.,"It did not help me in anyway, if you use this product, you will not be able to turn one side to another with ease, and I think everyone turns in bed frequently during pregnancy."
1,Just not comfortable...,"I have to be honest, I tried several times and was never able to get used to using the Snoogle body pillow. It was big and bulky, and when my hips would hurt, it took me too long to move it under the covers so that I could roll over. I was personally better off just using a pillow between my knees and one smushed under/into the side of my baby belly. I am sorry that I spent the money on this thing, instead of just making due with what I had already at home."
4,I love my Snoogle,"I give the Snoogle 4 stars because it isn't perfect. But I wouldn't want to be without one now that my pregnant belly is starting to grow. It positions my body perfectly for sleep. My husband and I sleep in a full size bed, so it is a squeeze to have such a large pillow, but it is totally worth it. I am sleeping better through the night than I did without the snoogle, and I have stopped complaining that we need a new mattress. My back doesn't hurt as much as it did pre-snoogle. I don't like that the cover is hard to remove and put back on. If it had a zipper or something it would be much better. I would have also preferred a choice of colors. Other than that I have no complaints. Don't expect to stay positioned in the snoogle all night at first unless you have always been a side sleeper. I found it took some getting used to. I would recommend this to any pregnant woman who is having trouble sleeping."
5,Extreme comfort,"I just bought it not sure if it was going to really work for all my aches, but it DID! I slept like I have not been able to in a while. The ""c"" shape really makes it easy to adjust to your body's need. It is firm enough to handle the extra weight of legs and hips. its shape also allows you to either support your back or front, and the cover is washable wich is very convenient. I am really impressed one pillow can help by body so much!"
3,Good but not great,"It helps for part of the night but not the entire night. I agree with others that it really does not breath well and contributes to feeling hot when you wake up for your frequents trips to the loo. This is my second pregnancy; I thought I was being so smart this time around to have a total body pillow but like the first, I could live without it. With that said, I have consistently used it since I purchased it but only for about half the night and then it is tossed to the floor. I was 6 months along when I purchased it and am now due anyday. For the $, it is not a bad price."
5,Must Have,This pillow is well worth the money. Expecting first child and have history of back problems. Sleep soooo much better with it. Will use after pregnancy. My new best friend!!!!!
3,I have a love/hate relationship with this Snoogle.,"I have a love hate relationship with this pillow. On one hand, it really works. I started using it at about 6 months pregnant because I was having a lot of trouble sleeping due to the changes in my body. And the first night I used it, I slept beautifully. Since then, my body has continued to change and the pillow has continued to really help my sleeping. It is very well designed.On the other hand, the pillow is way overpriced considering the quality. The pillow itself is filled with cheap poly filling and has a cheap cover. In fact, the fabric seems identical to the cheap pillows you get on a plane. The cover that comes with the pillow is also cheap polyester and doesn't have a zipper. So it takes a lot of wrangling and maneuvering to get the pillowcase on the pillow. For $50, this pillow is a total ripoff... but it works."
5,This is a must have!!!!!!,"I recently got this pillow and I cannot tell you how wonderful it is! I can finally sleep! I'm 18 weeks, and I've been using 4-5 pillows a night to try and get comfortable. I haven't been able to fall asleep on my left side like is recommended; I've been sleeping sitting up and after the first bathroom wake-up I could sleep on my side. With this I was comfortable instantly and fell right asleep. I aslo fell back asleep after getting up to use the restroom right away (which is new!) It is incredibly comfortable, and easy to move around with if you like to flip over. It also comes with a sheet that shows you tons of different ways to use it (more than is shown online!) I adore it!!! Worth every penny! **I'd like to add, now that my daughter is 7 months old, that I adored that pillow all through my pregnancy, it was a God-send!"
2,Not fit for everyone,"I am so much trouble getting into a restful sleep position at 6 months...I loved the idea of this pillow & the good reviews. I am 5'6"" & 130 pounds. I have a large belly, yet I am small in size. I am normally a side sleeper.The shape of this pillow did not fit my body correctly(because of the pre-shaped curves) If you put the head curve under your head your arm will fall asleep & I normally sleep with my arm under my head, so I don't get it. My belly was not supported & I still woke up with back pain.It takes up way too much room in a queen size bed, pushing dad 2 be almost to the floor! I still found myself wanting to flip & could not do so without constantly waking my husband.I think this pillow may work for some, yet not for me. I will just stick with multi-pillow props."
4,Great for early pregnancy!,"I got this pillow around the middle of my 3rd month, so the price point wasn't that big a deal for me. I had about 6 more months to go so that's about 10 bucks a month for relief from back pain? Yeah I'm in!People have pointed out that the cover that comes with the pillow is itchy, and while it didn't really bother me, it didn't feel great either. So like some of the other reviewers I also made my own pillow cover out of an old bed sheet. I will say that it does get very warm while sleeping (at least for me) but that's easly fixed by turning a fan on or sleeping under a light cover."
2,NOT for tall women,"Unfortunately, this isn't going to do much for me throughout my pregnancy. I am 6'1"" and this can't comfortably cradle my head AND provide appropriate support between the knees. I'm also not a fan of the hot material - quite surprised by the number of positive reviews. If I could return mine now, I absolutely would."
5,Body pillow,Makes sleeping a dream no tossing to find that comfort zone Especaily when you have an injury I would give this soogly as a present to all my family & friends
4,Good sleep with Leachco Snoogle Pillow,"I bought the pillow with some skepticism as this pillow is not sold in many maternity stores in SingaporeHowever after checking out the reviews on Amazon.com, I decided to try it.It was amazing that I can sleep in my 33rd week without much ado. The unique C shape propped up my neck and I could lie on both sides without problem. I would recommend getting this pillow in your 30th week so you could spend sleeping hours productively and wake up fresh for the day."
3,Makes me to stiff to move,"I got this pillow because of an injury in my left hip makes me unable to lie on my left side. I can only lie on my back, right side and sometimes my stomach if I'm careful. I like this pillow but using it all night makes me to stiff in the morning. I don't roll over when I use it and I feel a bit like I'm lacking something in the front so I have to hug my old pillow as well. I think I'll keep it around but I won't use it every night."
3,Watch Out if You Have Allergies!,I really wanted this pillow for my second pregnancy and my girlfriend surprised me with it. It is very comfortable and would be great except that every time I had it near me I started to have a coughing fit. Whatever the pillow is made of is not friendly to gals with allergies. (And I don't even consider myself that sensitive to allergens). I was very disappointed because now I can't have the comfort that it provides without the discomfort of an allergy attack. I had to return this item. I still give it 3 stars because it is really comfortable to use.
5,THE BEST PILLOW EVER FOR PREGNANT WOMEN!!!,"I got this with my first pregnancy and could NOT sleep without it! I weaned myself off of it after my son was born (it was so hard - I almost cried!) and now that I'm pregnant again, I'm washing the cover & ready to start using it again! I got the best nights sleep after I started using it and my back felt better within a few nights. It easily turns with you as you flip over from side to side. I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I recommeded it to all my pregnant friends."
1,Not for Tall Women!,"After having terrible hip pain while sleeping, I was so excited when this pillow finally arrived. HOWEVER, after sleeping with it for two nights, I have terrible neck pain...in fact, I'm using a heating pad right now...it's that bad. I'm 5'10"" and in order to ""fit"" inside the curves of this pillow, I have to scrunch up a bit, and wind up bending my neck at a weird angle. I will take hip pain over this neck pain any day!!"
2,"Uncomfortable pillow for head, material moves inside pillow thinning it out","I have had this pillow for only a few months now. I got it at the beginning of my 2nd trimester, and now I'm nearing the beginning of my 3rd trimester. Within that time, the stuffing inside of the bottom part of the pillow has thinned out, making my legs too close together. I need more spacing between my knees so that my hips don't hurt when I sleep. Painful hips from sleeping on your side is SO annoying, if you haven't experienced it already, you just might if you are using this pillow. In addition to this, the head part of the pillow is too flat. I struggle with sleeping on this as a pillow because my neck hurts. Overall I do not recommend this product. I read tons of reviews on Amazon of different pillows, and this one was the cheapest with the best review. Don't fall for the same trap I did!!! Shell out the extra bucks and get a better quality, better stuffed pillow.... you'll be happier sleeping if you do."
1,Did not help during pregnancy,"I purchased this pillow early in my pregnancy after reading reviews on the various pillows on the market. It turned out to be extremely uncomfortable almost as soon as I got it and completely unusable later in the pregnancy. It was impossible to sleep on one side all night long without my arm or leg falling asleep. Trying to switch sides became a long process that inevitably woke up my husband and only frustrated me more. Using it as a back support was not at all helpful. I had better back support sleeping on my side on the couch. I ended up using separate pillows to support my stomach and legs. In the end, it was a total waste of money."
3,Mixed feelings,"This pillow helps me sleep better- no more hip pain and the only back pain is due to regular pregnancy stuff, not from sleeping. I love sleeping with the pillow- I actually look forward to going to bed! (And not because I'm tired all the time.)BUT1st: I tend to flip flop when I sleep (turn from hip to hip) and trying to maneuver underneath the covers with the pillow between my legs and under my head is a little awkward. I feel bad that I'm disturbing my husband.2nd: (And perhaps more important)My husband calls this thing ""the great wall of pillow."" It completely cuts out any cuddling before falling asleep or upon waking up. If I flipped the pillow over to have the open side toward my husband, then my exit from the bed makes my trips to the bathroom in the middle of the night quite treacherous. I have to roll over the pillow in order to get out of bed- and rolling out of bed is precarious enough!BUT, when he is out of town, I LOVE this pillow!"
5,Gave in & so glad I did,"I was very resistant to the idea of buying a pillow specific for pregnant women. However, I'm so glad that I gave in. After trying multiple pillows across weeks and sometimes within just one night, the Leacho Snoogle pillow is all I need. Getting a decent night's sleep while pregnant is challenging enough with leg cramps and the baby's acrobatics; the Leacho Snoogle pillow really has helped my back feel more comfortable and keep me from having to chase pillows with my legs throughout the night. When I think about how much a good night's sleep is worth, the seemingly high sticker price is well worth the money. I am only 4'10"" so I wasn't sure if the product would be OK for someone so short v. the average. But it works great for me!"
3,No Pillow Case?,Recieved my pillow today and opened it and there is no pillow case? I thought that I read that it came with one it was just scratchy? Well there is no other case with it just the pillow. I went ahead and ordered another one that cost $30. Oh well I'll try the pillow tonight anyway.
3,Too bulky,Pillow is helpful but bit too large which makes it uncomfortable if you don't have king size bed. Overall it's ok but I might have looked for something else if I knew exactly how big it was...
3,Pregnancy Pillow,It works ok but is to bulky in some areas and that makes it uncomfortable in a lot of ways.
2,Disapointed,"I was under the impression that this pillow already came with a cover but it didn't so I now have to buy a cover for it or cut off all the tags. Then there is the fact that i'm 5'4"" and the bottom curve is between my ankles. It's also not as firm as I thought. The head part is very firm but if you put your arm on it or put it between your knees it goes flat. I would not recommend this pillow."
3,GREAT... at first,"I got this when I was only 3 months pregnant because I'm a back sleeper and was trying to train myself to sleep on my side like everyone says I should. For the first couple of months I wondered how I EVER lived without this pillow, pregnant or not! It was so comfy and lulled me easily off to dreamland. Now, though, it's been 4 months (and I still have 2 to go) and it has significantly lost it's fluff, especially where I put my head and my knees. I still use it and like it, but I wish it would've held up better for the whole pregnancy."
5,No complaints here!,I think the pillow is great ! It's not as big as I thought it would be based on some of the reviews I read prior to purchasing. I bought it while I was pregnant but I use it more now that I'm not! It's really very comfortable!
4,This pillow saved me!,"During my first pregnancy a friend let me borrow her Snoogle - and it made SUCH a difference in my sleep! I didn't have to stay awake to rearrange pillows every time I needed to roll over. My friend is now living in Wyoming, so I went ahead and bought my own Snoogle pillow for this pregnancy ... It's great, although I may end up putting a little more pillow filling in it to make it a bit firmer. Other than that, it's great!"
2,Good in concept but not in reality - for me at least,"I bought the Snoogle because I found that I was waking up each morning with a sore back. The first night I used it, it seemed okay. But from then on, anytime I use it, I wake up even more sore than without it. I think the reason is having the pillow under my head and between my legs but nowhere else - it seems to make me lay out of alignment so I wake up with a sore back, shoulders, neck, etc. I originally thought this one would be better than the J-shaped one (can't remember manufacturer's name) but now I think the j-shaped one would be better because then you can just use your own pillows. I actually think that I may just buy one of those wedges now and use that for under my belly and stick a regular pillow between my knees. So the Snoogle may work well for some people, but for me it actually made things worse."
5,Snoogle pillow,"I am 6mos pregnant and recently my husband started working 3rd shift. I ordered this pillow because I had been using him to support my back and using a pillow between my legs. This pillow is great! I hardly even miss my husband. My back is supported, and I wake up feeling better than when I was sleeping with him."
4,Great Idea,"The snoogle is good overall. It does seems to bother my neck though. Maybe this is because I have fibromyalgia and I am used to a neck support pillow. I still use it but use my own head pillow instead. I push the head part away from me.I also agree with another review that the cover is not great. It's not soft and it easily peels off part of the pillow. Other than that it's a great pillow and I love that you can use make other shapes with it to watch TV, etc."
4,A great pillow for pregnancy!,This pillow was weird at first to sleep with it but after a week I can't sleep without it. It helped my back and give me more support.
5,Amazing pillow - Very Comfortable,"I bought this pillow for my girlfriend in her 5th month of pregnancy. It took her two or three nights to adjust to the pillow; however, she said she noticed an improvement sleeping the very first night. Before she had the pillow she frequently woke up at night to readjust the 4 pillows she used to support her and keep herself comfortable. Now she sleeps all night. I think she will continue to use this product after she has her baby. She absolutly loves her Snoogle!We share a queen size bed and I do not find this product very large. In fact, this pillow seems to keep her more concentrated on her side of the bed. I was worried that the pillow would take up too much space on the bed and crowd me; however this is not true.My girlfriend is now in her 7th month, she has used the pillow every night, and day (for her nap of course!), for over two months and highly recommends this product."
5,LOVE IT!,"I wanted to buy this pillow for a while but thought it was a bit much $$ to pay for a pillow, but when I reached my 6th month I was miserable, so I was willing to try anything. Let me tell you I don't think I would have slept much in my last trimester if it weren't for this pillow! I know it sounds corny but it really helps, and I have chronic back problems. Be realistic this will not solve a your sleepless issues, and all bodies are different but it's worth a try. I just found out i'm preggers AGAIN, so glad I kept this thing. Oh yeah my husband even likes sleeping with this thing, (he would kill me if he knew I told someone!) hehehehe..."
5,A Must Have for Pregnant Women,"I'm a back sleeper so I was having difficulty sleeping on my side while pregnant; however, the Snoogle kept me propped up on my side. Even when I lean back the Snoogle keeps one side of your body elevated so that you never lie flat on your back. It's comfortable, easier than placing 6 pillows each night, and ergonomically shaped. I'd highly recommend it. I'd also recommend getting a Snoogle pillow cover because the one it comes with is hard to take off to wash."
3,It's okay but I'm disappointed...,"I bought this pillow when I was five months pregnant and two months later, I'm not using it...and it's not because I don't want to! Like the other reviewers, I found the pillow case to be of a very low quality fabric. I have to slip one of my pillow cases over the top of it, but they don't stay on throughout the night of course. Also, the part where I rest my head is way too firm and I've woken up with a sore neck because my head has been at a weird angle all night. Basically, I would have to really re-work this thing to make it useful for me and I just haven't had the time so I'm back to using multiple pillows. Wish I had read the reviews here before spending $50!"
4,YES!,"My God I love this pillow! I didn't think that I would be able to sleep with a giant pillow like this but once I tried it, I couldn't give it up. It took my husband some haggling for me to stop using it after the baby was born! The only issue is that it would be very helpful if Babies R Us sold the pillow cases for it. Since it is all white, it shows dirt easily and it is hard getting the white case on and off.It is an awesome pillow though!"
5,I LOVE MY SNOOGLE,"I have never slept so good in all my pregnancy. Its like waking from the most intense sleep ever. i don't even miss my husband when he gets out of bed anymore. It puts my body into a comfortable, safe, stable position. I dont toss, turn, or wake up anymore...rather than a few pregnant exceptions that are unavoidable. I recommend this to everyone and I will be sure to make this my congrats gift to everyone i know that is pregnant as well. God bless whomever invented it. I LOVE YOU!"
5,Great Gift,I bought the snoogle for my pregnant wife as a christmas gift. She loves it and has recently said that it is the greatest gift ever. It definitely keeps her in a healthy position while sleeping. The snoogle gives great support to the back and belly and works well between the legs to aleviate lower back pain. This would be a great gift for any expecting mother.
4,I love to snuggle my snoogle,"My mom bought this for me for Christmas and I am SO happy with it. Yes, the cover is boring and somewhat scratchy, but they sell replacement covers (or you can make your own if you're crafty) and the comfort that I get from the shape of the pillow outweighs the discomfort of the pillowcase. One drawback is that it's so comfy, my dog wants to share it with me, and I'm not really the sharing type so when I wake up the night to roll over or get up to go to the bathroom, I have to fight the dog for the pillow. Seriously though, this is the most comfortable pillow I've used. Prior to receiving the Snoogle, I was using a regular body pillow but it was really bulky. I love the way the Snoogle either wraps around me, or I wrap myself around it. Soooo comfy! I just want to go home now and take a nap with it!"
5,Great night sleep!,"I had an original snoogle that didn't have the removable cover and it wasn't flexible and tore several times. It ended up in the trash. But THIS snoogle with the removable cover has been awesome! It is more flexible, easy to clean, and soooooo comfortable. I suffer from a herniated disc and I also love to sleep on my belly. With this pillow, I've eliminated a lot of the back pain, and reduced my chances of rolling onto my baby belly. It's great because it can be adjusted to fit any position. My toddler son also loves to cuddle up in it. We call it the ""cocoon"" and he wraps it completely around himself and feels secure. It's so comfy! I highly recommend this pillow for all pregnant women. It is fantastic, and you'll be happy to get rid of the 20 other pillows you were using to avoid rolling, etc."
4,Great Product!,"I love this pillow, it has been a life saver! It saves from having to fill my bed with 5 individual pillows, and now my husband can fit! The only thing i found is that when i first recieved the pillow i went to wash the pillow top and it was very hard to put back on, other than that i highly recommend it."
4,It really helps with back support,"I think this pillow is a must for any pregnant woman who struggles with sleep at night. It helps support your back and hips. It is however really large and it took me a few nights to learn how to sleep with it (almost like there is a technique to it). But once I figured it out, my sleeps have been as good as they're going to get while being pregnant. I sleep comfortably with this pillow. My only disappoint is that I wish they made a cover for it so that I can wash it."
2,Uncomfortable,"I would suggest buying a body pillow/bolster instead. It was not comfortable to use as a pillow, so my neck and shoulders would be sore the next morning."
5,Sleep!,After heavy contemplation on this product I went to my local babies r us to see it in person. After seeing it there for 15 dollars more and feeling it through the package I decided to order it here. I am completely satisfied with the pillow.It has medium firmness and is plenty long enough for my 5'6 height. I like it positioned in the front or the back as it supports the belly and the back depending on placement. I would recommend getting a cover when you order (it has a thin white one on)it. I am headed to buy a cover for it now.
4,Very helpful!,"I agree with some of the reviews about the scratchyness. I am not going to spend another $20.00 on a cover. I put a regular pillowcase over the top and it's fine. It is pricy but, if you were to buy the regular pillows that make up this one it would be the same price. I love it. It's not huge like people complain about. My husband has plenty of room in our Queen bed still."
1,"flat, unsupportive and cumbersome","I slept on this pillow for a total of one night and was up most of the night with terrible hip pain even though I was sleeping with the pillow between my legs for support. While it was totally unsupportive for what I needed it for (compresses pretty flat when you lay on it), it was also large and cumbersome and took up a fair amount of space. I decided to return it but have yet to see a refund from the company which shouldn't surprise me since it took them over three weeks to send me the pillow in the first place."
2,Hard to say on this one,"I bought this snoogle to help me sleep but I am not too sure about it really. You cannot use a pillow with it and be compfortable and also you definatly cannot have a down cover on your mattress or the snoogle just sinks into it. It is hard to position compfortably. If you are a person who sleeps in one position all night long then you might like it. I dont know. I try everything to get a nice sleep and nothing workd so maybe it is me...but for 50 bucks, put a blanket between your knees."
3,It's ok,Bought this in hopes of having a better nights sleep. It helps some but not as much as I was hoping for. Maybe a couples more weeks it'll work it's magic.
1,Not worth the money,"I bought this item because I knew a few friends that had used it. They gave me mixed reviews, but I needed to buy something since I'm almost in my third trimester and starting to feel uncomfortable at night. This pillow is stiff and the fabric was rough. I tried using it one night and ended up throwing it out of the bed at 3 AM. I wish I would have bought something more simple that doesn't come up to my head. I prefer my regular pillow under my head. I would not recommend buying this pillow."
3,ITS OK.....,"Im a stomach sleeper, so getting comfortable while pregnant is almost impossible. I got this pillow to see if I could train myself to sleep on my sides. Unfortunately, after about a month, I have tossed it out of the bed and went back to using several pillows. It is great to prop up on and sit elevated if you have heart burn. It is a VERY big pillow, and like most pregnant women, I have to get up numerous times a night and the pillow was always in the way. I am expecting twins and think it will serve as a great feeding pillow. Dont completely hate the pillow but it didnt help me sleep any better either!!!"
5,fantastic,"I ordered this pillow for a close friend of mine who is eight months pregnant. she didn't know pregnancy pillows even exist, so I ordered this one for her. SHE LOVES IT! And even better, the company I ordered it from shipped it out the same day, and it arrived very quickly. awesome seller, awesome pillow!"
2,Rough material,"I returned this item. I was a giant pregnant lady that needed support, but the fabric is really rough on the skin. I am sure there is a cover out there, but that's more $. i ended up buying just a large soft pillow instead."
5,Excellent present for my daughter,It has already helped her and will do more even so as it becomes more difficult to sleep during pregnancy
5,Pregnant wife? if you answered yes than this is a MUST HAVE,"Pregnant wife? if you answered yes than this is a MUST HAVE.my wife used the crap out of this wile pregnant and still does when curled up on the couch watching tv, heck even our Dog love this pillow she will curl up in the middle and lay her head on it..."
4,Love my Snoogle!,"My husband bought this for me before leaving for a deployment. I have to admit, it's really nice to have something body sized in my bed with me. It makes it seem less empty. Not only that, I find that I sleep so much better with this pillow than without. I'm not sure why it works, but it seems to support my back and now I wake up pain free and not as often throughout the night.While most women buy this pillow during pregnancy, I can tell you that you don't need to be pregnant to enjoy this pillow."
3,Decent product...just not for me.,"This pillow is supposed to envelope you and fit under your head but I don't find it a fulfilling neck pillow so I end up using a regular pillow for my head and contorting the snoogle to work for my lower body. Its okay, but in hindsight, a product I could have lived without."
3,Good...But Not Great,"I purchased this pillow hoping that it would allow me back support while at the same time giving me support between my legs. Previously, I had been using a long, body pillow in front, and a regular pillow in the small of my back. I've found that the Snoogle is just too long and not firm enough to adjust to my needs. I'm average height (5'6"") and it is too long--I have to keep wadding it up under my head or between my legs to get support. I also don't think that it is thick enough in comparison to a rectangular body pillow. I just haven't used it enough to justify the cost."
3,Didn't work for me,"I was having sciatic pain as a result of my pregnancy, and I purchased this pillow based on its high reviews. I found that the pillow actually made my lower back pain worse. I tried using it on several nights, and it didn't help alleviate any of my back pain. It's also really bulky and I found it was difficult to shift the pillow and move it around (if I wanted to change which side I was laying on) once I had it in the bed, with a comforter pulled up over myself. I also thought it woudl help support my pregnant belly, but I've found a smaller wedge pillow works much better than this. Good luck to those of you who try it! I hope it works for you."
2,"Cumbersome, Not Helpful","My friend lent me her Snoogle for my pregnancy, swearing it was the most comfortable thing she'd ever experienced. I loved it for the first night or so, but then found myself getting repeatedly tangled up in it and unable to maintain the adjustments I needed to sleep comfortably (since the entire pillow is connected, when you move one part, the rest wants to move with it). I eventually curled it into an ""O"" shape and now have it against the wall behind the bed to prop myself up while I watch TV. I also found that it was stuffed too full to give my belly the under-support that it needed.Now I'm using a belly wedge and a regular flat, rectangular body pillow, as well as a couple of other supplementary pillows where I need them. A million times better than this un-tameable monster. Thanks, but no thanks on this one."
3,"Comfy, yet ineffective","I find the pillow really cradles my upper body. Unfortunately, it's my hips and lower back that need the support. This product does not provide enough lower body support. And the ""opening"" is inconvenient - I still have to put a pillow there to support my belly or back."
3,Not as comfortable as I was hoping,"I purchased this hoping it would help me stay in postition while I sleep and eliminate back pain. So far, I still need extra pillows to get my leg high enough and even though I am only 5'2"", it is not quite long enough to support my whole back without curving, which ends up causing pain after all night. I wish I hadn't spent the money and just used strategically placed pillows."
4,it works :),"I was experiencing shoulder pain from sleeping on my left side, as is recommended for pregnant women during their 2nd trimester. My hips were having a hard time of it as well. This pillow really helped a lot. The only thing that happens sometimes, is my left knee begins to ache - I put another smaller pillow underneath and that does wonders. I also purchased a wedge for my tummy - I look like a cocoon of pillows! It really helps me stay on my side - before I would wake up kinda dizzy and find myself on my back - this helps. I've had it for a month or so and it retains its shape. The only complaint I have is the pillow cover is HOT - I wish it were made of 100% cotton. I found a replacement cover made by the company that is 100% cotton and it cost $30! I thought that was kind of rip.. bringing the cost of pillow to a whopping $80? ... but I'm most likely going to splurge and get it, because being pregnant and super hot at night is not comfy. I still love this pillow though. :)"
4,Leachco snoogle,Very useful item for pregnant women.....can be used after pregnancy as well. It comes with handy instructions to show you how you can use it in different ways.
4,Great pillow for aching backs...,"Really great pillow, I suffer from chronic back pain and sleeping was always a challenge, could never get comfortable. But this pillow really helps, I should give it 5 stars but the pillow case is difficult to pull on and off...but how I sleep really makes up for that one annoying thing.I would recommend for people (even non-pregnant ones) that it does helps."
4,really comfy!! Softer cover would be nice,"I tried a couple of these types of pillows first. The boppy body pillow (UGH!!) and a regular body pillow.My Snoogle is sooooooo comfy, I didn't want to get up! I felt sooo relaxed. All my joints were loosened up and my hip and shoulder pain is gone!! I'm 5'7"" and about 5 months preggo. I'm an average size and this fits me perfectly!The only thing I would change is the cover. It's a poly/cotton blend and it's rough and itchy. I have a friend who sews and is going to make me a new cover out of better fabric. Other than that, this is the best pregnancy product I've come across (and this is my 4th baby!)"
2,Not good for petite moms,"I had heard from a friend that this is the thing to have so we shelled out $50 for the pillow. I'm only 5'1"" and it is way too big. It's just too thick for being under my belly, and it's just cumbersome in the bed. The cover is cheap, extremely low thread count. The back support, however, is nice.I'd only buy this if you're absolutely miserable. Otherwise, I'm going to just stick with a traditional pillow."
2,Not that helpful,I wasn't so happy with this product for myself. It was uncomfortable to sleep with and I tried many times. It was bulky. It didn't fit fit any of my needs.
5,totally recommended!,"My husband just purchased the Snoogle for me, and it is divine! It is so much better then cramming pillows all around me and taking up half the bed. I am 5 '9 and the snoogle fits great. Turning over at night isn't easy, but it wasn't easy before the snoogle either. I can tell you that it is much easier to flip the top of the snoogle over, and then just turn over, then it is to rearrange 3 pillows at 3am. I highly recommend this pillow, even for just laying around. I am on bedrest and about 7 months pregnant and it has really made me more comfortable all around. It is very flexible so you can use the top half for a support when you are propped up in bed. I love it! It comes with a removable cover, but it is white. It is probably a good idea to buy an additional colored cover to keep it clean. Well worth the money for my last two remaining months of sleep before our baby comes!"
2,"lousy pillow, i got a stiff neck","I got this pillow because I have a hard time falling asleep at night. I toss and turn (from my right side to my left side and vice versa), this pillow is not good for those who like to go from one side to the other. It is too big to turn and you have to take off the covers and get positioned again. I did feel support for my back, but I cannot sleep with it around my head. I woke up with a stiff neck both nights I used it! I had to return it. I don't think it is thick enough or wide enough. I am only 5'3 and found it hard to stay comfortable all night. I got it with the hopes that this would be my saving grace and help me get a good night's sleep, but it was not. I am still looking for another pillow to help with my back pain."
3,"Comfortable, BUT quality is lacking","I bought the snoogle when I was only 2 months pregnant. It was super soft and comfortable and an absolute necessity. Unfotunately, after only 4 months use, the pillow ripped in 2 places (at the curves) and the insides began to shift (the fabric also developed pills all over it). I am still using it (I am due in less than 2 weeks), but am very disappointed. Between the empty spots and rips I know that this pillow will not hold up for breastfeeding Ias described on the package) and I definitely cannot forsee spending this much money again on a product that didn't hold up."
4,Doing the Job,"I didn't have this with my last pregnancy and instead bought a bunch of cheap pillows that never stayed where I needed them.The one thing I would change about the Snoogle is the length. I am almost 5'7"" and I feel like the pillow was made for people a couple inches shorter than me. Perhaps in the future they can have size options based on your height? That said, I'm sleeping much better than I was with my last pregnancy."
2,Not easy to use,"I bought this as a friend recommended it as a necessity during pregnancy. It is good quality. But for me this is very hard to use. Once you put it between your leg and back and head, you can't move or turn any more. It is bulky and it is too thick to support under your belly. I ended up using it only once and had such a bad night of sleep that I stopped using it. It is much easier for me to just put a thin pillow under my belly and another pillow between my legs. So while this is not a complaint about the product itself, I think the concept of using it is not something everyone will enjoy, and is an individual thing. So you may want to try it once and see if you even like it before you dish out $50 for it."
3,Just OK,"This body pillow is not nearly as comfortable as my past body pillow, which was the Comfort-U (which I highly recommend!). It's too stiff, although I'm sure it'll soften over time. The stitching in the curves is too tight and therefore not flexible enough. The fabric is a little rough too. I was expecting a much more comfortable pillow and am now regretting I didn't stick with the Comfort-U, which is a little bigger and bulkier, but you feel surrounded by a cloud and it's so much more comfortable."
2,Too complicated,"I used this product for about 2 weeks but ended up returning it as I couldn't get used to it's size. I kept trying different ends for side sleeping but I couldn't get used to it. It was too high. Also, I didn't like the feel of the fabric cover (it is a mix of coton and polyster)..so I covered it in a cotton sheet to use. Also, it being so bulky, it was very hard to move around and took a lot of space in the bed."
3,Nice for Naps,"I got this pillow for my second baby. I found it helpful really for just naps. If you are a ""flip flopper"" when you sleep, it is very difficult to flip over with it. It is good though if you sleep in a double size bed. You don't have 8 million pillows to deal with. I had to stop using it when I got too big to flip easily."
3,HUGE but overall I'd recommend to those in the 3rd trimester,I would recommend this pillow for those in the 3rd trimester. Any earlier and this is overkill. Any bigger and it is total overkill (there is one other version I was considering that is larger & thank goodness I didn't purchase that monster!). I would just recommend a simple boppy for 1st & 2nd trimesters like I used.Pro's:AffordableComfortable but it will take some time to figure out which position is most comfortable.Con's:It is HUGE especially to store when you aren't using.It is a pain to get around and then again back into position each time you have to get up to use the bathroom in the middle of the night.
4,Seems good for the long haul,"I've had this pillow 2 weeks now, that's at least a week longer than past pillows have lasted for me. I have chronic lower back pain that is helped by putting a pillow between my knees. Unfortunately it seems I squeeze their life out way before their time should be over, including medical grade foam. But this pillow seems like it will last the long haul. And when I imagine it will go flat in a year or so, it seems like it will be easy to reinvigorate with additional pillow fill :) I'd say well worth the month spent!"
3,Pricey and not well made.,"This is my second time purchasing this pillow. Buy online way overpriced at Babies R Us, but what isn't overpriced there? The pillow is a fugly plain white, seriously for 79.00 + tax couldn't they make a print or another color? The pillow covers run another $30.00 upwards, please. After 2-3 mos stuffing gets bunched, squashed and sags in curves and at bottom of pillow. Washing it makes it so much worse. Actual pillow inside the case is cheap, cheap material. When your pregnant for a full 9 mos, you want the product to hang in there with you, would be nice if it could go the distance with recovery as well.Not worth department store price, it works for awhile but not worth the price and not too many available alternatives."
3,"Okay, but a bit overpriced","I found this pillow okay. I am 5'10 and it could stand to be a bit longer. The curved ends form a bump under my head when I sleep (I always put a pillow over the Snoogle and still feel the bump). So, I eventually end up pulling the head piece of the Snoogle out from under my head and the pillow ends up being only useful for my legs/lower torso. Honestly, I think you could save your money and just hug up to a king sized pillow instead. I feel a bit confined sometimes when I sleep with this pillow. Am waiting for baby to get here to see if it works well as a Boppy. Overall, for $45 I would probably pass..."
3,Mixed feelings,"I had high hopes for the Snoogle, but it felt cumbersome in my bed. Every time I got up or tried to roll over, I felt like I was wrestling with it. The cover it comes with is stiff and not soft. I wish it came with a jersey cover instead of having to pay an extra $20+ to get one. I haven't given up on the pillow as it might come in handy later in pregnancy, but currently, it's been moved off the bed."
3,Ok in the short term...,"My chiropractor recommended I get a body pillow because I'm a stomach sleeper, and a pregnant friend recommended this one.It's nice and long, and was a good firmness when I got it. But in a few weeks, the stuffing began to clump up awkwardly, and the unlined zipper got stuck in the stuffing when I tried to redistribute it, so now it doesn't open all the way. It's hard to shift the pillow's position without getting out of bed entirely, which is really annoying, and it took me just a few days to rip the thin fabric while trying to move the bottom curved part around with my feet in the middle of the night.I can see a pregnant woman, who can't shift position a lot, using it for a few weeks or months. But for long term use, or use by restless sleepers, the quality just isn't high enough."
4,Great product - helps with back pain,"Comfy, easy to move, helps with hip and back pain. Can be used as a pillow and it feels warm"
4,Leachco total body,+ back/leg support+ keeps me on my sides throughout night- big when sharing a full size bed. Took time to adjust.
5,"Great for neck, back and hip pain!","This pillow is amazing even if your not pregnant. I suffer from low back, hip and neck pain and usually toss and turn all night. This pillow is very supportive and comfortable. It's not too thin or too bulky. I didn't even realize all the positions you can sit/sleep in with this pillow! It was a good buy for me!"
3,"Too bulky, but good shape","The pillow fits into the right spots to make you comfortable. However, it is so big, that I found it hard to change positions during the night."
4,Pregnancy pillow review,I bought b/c i couldn't sleep during my pregnancy. I was also having back pain too. The pillow gives me more options for positions to sleep comfortably throughout the night. It works great in that regard. Would recommend this item for anyone who has trouble sleeping. The only thing i am noticing is that the pillow is starting to loose its fluffiness. Could be also b/c my pregnancy is getting farther along. Make sure you get a cover for this thing as well. Gets dirty fast w/o one.
4,Indispensable,"I bought this on my 2nd trimester and I can't imagine sleeping without it now!I took 1 star because I do advise buying it with the 100% cotton cover with zipper. This pillow comes with a white polyester cover that is as hard to take out as it is to put it back! And after sleeping on it for a while you will want to take that cover out to wash it...Other than that, the product is excellent and I am very happy I purchased it when I did."
2,not meant for a pillowtop mattress,"Let me start by saying this is a really great product. I received it for Christmas while pregnant with our 2nd child. When I was laying on it on the carpeted floor downstairs it was soooo comfortable I almost fell asleep right there (and I don't sleep on hard surfaces). However, our bed is a pillow top mattress cover (really soft!!) and unfortunately when I went to use it in bed, it was comfy at first, but then I woke up in the middle of the night with really bad neck pain. It was because it was pushing my neck too far up while on my side and also on my back. I'm a physical therapist and could easily figure out it was placing my spine in an unnatural position. If you have a firmer mattress, then this is great for you! If you are like me and like a soft mattress, then maybe try one that doesn't also support the neck region."
5,Must have!!,"I purchased this pillow after sleeping became difficult early in my pregnancy and it was nearly impossible for me to keep from lying on my back. And I wish I hadn't waiting until my 2nd pregnancy to do so. The few nights I'm traveling without it, I miss it terribly. Even my husband loves it becasue it keeps me from rolling my big pregnant body onto him for support :)"
4,Works for me!,"Why did I wait until I was halfway through my second trimester to get this?? I tried the Boppy Cuddle pillow first because it was a bit cheaper. I don't recommend it. After one night sleeping with the Snoogle, I was comfortable for the first time in 3 months! It supports me wonderfully. If you turn over a lot, it can be a pain to readjust, but getting a good night's sleep is totally worth it."
4,Very Comfy,The support this item gives allows me to wake up with fewer back aches. I love how it wraps around me.
5,BEST PILLOW EVER!!!,"I'M 7 1/2 MONTHS PREGNANT AND IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO SLEEP ON MY SIDE WITHOUT WAKING UP NEXT MORNING WITH BACK PAIN. THIS PILLOW IS GREAT IT GIVES YOU THE SUPPORT YOU NEED ON YOUR BACK. MY ONLY COMPLAINT IS THAT THE MATERIAL OF THE PILLOW GETS TOO HOT DURING THE NIGHT, BUT I JUST PUT A FAN NEXT TO ME AND THE PROBLEM IS SOLVED. GREAT PILLOW!!! IT HELPED ME TO HAVE A BETTER SLEEP!!"
4,Pregnancy must have,Very comfy to snuggle with on one side but when I flip over during the night (which I do often) the other side is not as comfortable to me. I still really like it and would recommend it. It comes with instructions on several other ways to use the pillow which I haven't used yet but think it is awesome you can do so much- including using it as a breast-feeding pillow. I also like how this pillow doesn't take up too much space in our bed. My last pregnancy I used a big body pillow and I took up 2/3s of our bed but now I am able to use only 1/2.
2,Difficult for new side sleepers; uncomfortable for head,"I'm short (5"") and a new side sleeper with pregnancy, so maybe NO pillow would be ideal. It is thin and tightly stuffed (no give) so it's good for keeping the legs apart/hips in line, though a wider pillow at the bottom would be better. The top is just too uncomfortable--I prefer my own head pillow. So it's a struggle to use the parts I want and shift away the parts I don't. If this were a little fatter, with looser stuffing (with more give) and fewer curlicues it would be a better pillow."
5,Would recommend to anyone pregnant!,I was a belly sleeper and this pillow has helped me get a good night's sleep. It is so nice that you don't have to constantly adjust it through the night as you change position. So great that I take it along when we travel if I can!
5,Happy Wife = Good Buy,"This pillow was highly recommended to me by several friends who recently had babies. My wife was less than thrilled when I presented it (it is, after all, just a pillow and not very romantic). However, since the minute I gave it to her she has been carrying it around the house nonstop.I thought it was a little on the expensive side, but Amazon was the best price I found."
1,good if you have two,I am 5 months pregnant and have not been able to sleep for about 2 months now. I saw this pillow and had next day service hoping this would help. NOT! I think if there was two i would have better support but not for $75.00 each. I would not recommend this pillow. Once you open it you own it it is not covered at all so you are pretty much stuck with it. I strongly suggest if you know some one who has it try it before you waste your money like i did.
4,Makes you sleep comfortably,This is a real good purchase.I'm 5 and 1/2 months pregnant and using this pillow from last 10 days.It comforts you really well and relieves back aches.Only complication is makes it tougher to turn in bed. You need to move the pillow which makes it complicated. occupies some space in bed but its worth it.
2,"Good Movie, Bad Game","I picked up this packed, having enjoyed the two Mummy movies, and thinking it would be cool to play a game where you can either be O'Connell or Imhotep. Unfortunately, the game was just poorly designed. Graphics collision errors abound, resulting in your character being able to partially go through certain objects, or stand in empty space without falling. These things detract from the game and make it frustrating to play. I really did try to look past the downsides, as I am generally easy-to-please video game-wise, but this one just wasn't as much fun as it should have been. The basic concepts were ok...you are exploring an underground temple, your son gets trapped and you must free him, amongst other quests, but the design was likely rushed to coincide with the DVD release, resulting in bugs and design flaws galore. I'd recommend buying the DVD by itself, or at least renting the game before you plunk down all that money for it."
4,Love the Mummy Returns PS2 Game,"I recently purchased The Mummy Returns for PS2. I recently played on PS2 for the first time and the Mummy Returns was the first game I used. I enjoyed it immensely and am still trying to get past the first level. Critics of the game are probably people who spend most of thier free time playing video games and consider themselves ""experts."" If you are a beginner, this game is fine."
2,Good movie bad game...,"The movie included with this pack is an excellent action flick that will show of your home theatre system nicely. It isn't a movie that should be criticized on plot, etc. because in the end it wasnt going for an oscar award and simply trying to be a good action movie which it is. the special effects are very well done and the sound is also above average. Where this movie really shines is the picture quality. The widescreen edition's picture quality is perfect. i cant imagine how good the pan and scan version looks. However this pack does have its down side. and that is the poor quality of the video game of The Mummy Returns. Lets face it there arent that many good video games out there made after movies (exceptions being Goldeneye N64, possibly The World is not Enough N64). So in the end the high price on this pack probably isnt worth it, you should just get the DVD alone and save yourself the money"
4,"Yeaaaaahh, I'm the first one to write a review for this book !!!!!!!!","This is a solid book with great crafting ideas. It's ideal for someone who may want to learn a new craft. There are lots of ideas and instructions for a variety of crafting topics. There are also variations on the ideas that they give you. Some topics are candlemaking, soapmaking, mosaics, jewelry making and lots more. I'm a little surprised that currently Amazon is not offering the book at a cheaper price as that's why I usually buy my books on Amazon. But at least you get $25 worth of tips and ideas. Although my favorite crafts are scrapbooking, cross stitch, wreath making and home decor, I'm always looking for that something extra to learn about. This book is a great all around craft book. Enjoy."
1,Did not receive my purchase although I paid for it,"Attn: Customer Service:I had placed an order thru Amazon.com for the referenced book, Michaels Book of Arts & Crafts. I never received this book although I did prepay for it. I sent an email to the person/company that I had purchased from and received a written reply that it had been mailed to me. I asked for her to put some type of tracer on this and have not heard back. I will never purchase from that company again. I paid my money in good faith yet failed to receive what I paid for. I am very disappointed in her followup and service after the sale. She received payment from my debit card but I received absolutely nothing but a deduction from my checking account and lack of interest on the vendor's part.Thank you for the opportunity to express my dissatisfaction over the transaction I attempted to make and the book I never received."
1,Not if you're calling anyone important,"I bought this because other reviewers had said great things about it. Maybe it works if you are a salesperson who calls 800 random people a week. But when you fewer than 10 named accounts and are in larger sales, this is not the tape you need. His big secret to getting appointments is this: ""Hi Mr/Ms Whoever, I'm so and so from company x. I want to make an appointment with you to talk about [enter product/service here]. You do want [enter benefit here], don't you?"" I can't imagine that most people can't come up with that themselves. The moral of the story is: If you're selling life insurance, this might be of some use, since he lets you know almost everyone you use this technique on will say no, so you don't feel so bad when you're rejected. If you're selling anything else, save your money. Try ""The Power To Get In"" by Boylan."
1,not the right usb cable,this cable looked like it would work with my z525a but it did not. i was disappointed.
2,broke easily,"gotta be fair so i didnt give it 1 star. it was my fault as well, baby played with it, his drooling on it caused water damage, but it's not like my 810i which has been drooled on by my 2 kids and is as good as ever."
4,No Frills,"I was initially sceptical of buying this product, but took a calculated risk because of the low price. The cable does not have the Sony Ericsson logo and work perfectly. Spend the low price, you won't be disappointed.Tip Toe Burgler"
5,Great,Ordered from SFPlanet fast shipping and usb cable Worked on w580iI used it to debrand my phone. Would Recommend to others
1,I didn't get this item.,How I can write a review of that product which i didn't get yet. So sorry i couldn't give any review because i lost all three packages which i ordered on same day.
2,Sony Ericsson USB Cable,I need to return this product because I bought a different phone...the Samsung Slider...please help me with how best to return if it's still available.
1,Unable to review at this time,"I have not had the oportunity to use the product as yet, so I can not rewiew it."
5,"It works, if you need to get data off your phone",Simple product; it does what it's supposed to. I wish I had one of these originally before my phone died. I tried salvaging whatever information was left on it using this cable and was able to save a few things before reinstalling the phone software.
2,Poor Quality after-market part,"I received the usb cable promptly as is normal with my Amazon orders, however I was disappointed because the cable had the outer inoculative jacket split everywhere there was a bend from being wound up and twist tied to ship. I could see right through to the wire inside and it looks dry rotted, however, it does link my phone to the computer via the usb outlet. Forget about charging your phone with this wire. For the price it is hardly worth returning."
1,Item pictured is OEM item received is GENERIC!,"Listing implies you will receive an OEM item. You will receive a generic item.Item is listed as ""Sony Ericsson USB Cable DCU-60."" Link on listing page is ""Other products by Sony Ericsson Mobile."" Item pictured is of a ""Sony Ericsson USB Cable DCU-60."" Everything implies that item is OEM!When contacted, seller's reply was ""it was not advertised as an OEM cable."" Seller suggested I return item for refund, The cost to return would exceed price of item."
5,Great deal for a USB Cable for my Sony Ericsson W518a phone from Original Equipment Manufacturer.,It's a top quality product from the Original Equipment Manufacturer. A rock bottom price for an equipment specific USB Cable. The $5.95 shipping & handling is more than offset by the low cost.
5,generic,"I was surprised how quickly I received it. I was a little hesitant when I opened the package because it was in a small zip lock bag, no manufacturer brand packaging. But I tried it out and it works great and just as the OEM models. I would recommend it. Also, perfectly priced!"
4,Works Great,"This product works great, I was able to download my photos from my phone so I could print them out."
5,Great value on a cable,"When I compared the Amazon price with the price I would have had to pay AT&T, I was at first skeptical. AT&T wanted nearly $20 for this cable. Through Amazon, I paid less than $4! When I received it, I used the cable right away with my phone and found it to work just fine. Thanks for the great value!"
3,You might want to handle this cable delicately,"I used this cable about 5 times until it broke. The head of the cable, which connects to the ""female"" parts of the phone broke in half. I managed to glue the pieces back, and it works albeit with a little difficulty with exposed wires."
1,awful,"threw it out. Didn't fit my phone and I'm out $5, but it was easier to toss it than return it."
5,"As described, fast shipping!",Cable worked perfectly. It was brand new and shipped quick. Very pleased with this seller.
5,"Excellent buy, quick delivery, perfect condition USB cable",This product was delivered to me in excellent condition and in a timely manner. The length of the cable is great and I am very satisfied with the product.
5,Right product at right price,Bought this because my cell phone came without a USB cable for synching with my laptop. This item works perfectly at a much better price than that of the service provider.
2,Sony Z520a,"This product claimed to have the ability to transfer data (pictures and such) from my phone to computer and back. It can't. Also, it charges the phone extremely slowly. Not a great product."
4,Good product,"Fast delivery, good product. But the smell of the cable is not very good in the first week."
2,False Advertisment,"You will get a cheap stiff generic cable, NOT the pictured OEM Sony cable. Even though the seller claims ""Brand New Original Sony Ericsson DCU-60 Data Cable in manufacturer sealed Sony Ericsson unopened packaging"". I gave it 2 stars because it works and didn't fall apart in my hand the first time I plugged it into the phone like the even crappier cable I bought previously from another bogus seller. It looks like if you want a decent cable you will just have to buy it from Sony and pay the $20+SH. Beware, A1 Accessories is not the only seller that lies to their customers about this cable."
3,Didnt Work,"I am sure this is a great product but it wasnt compatible with my cell phone I have Sony Ericsson J220A model and it didnt work. Some sellers may tell you that it will work or should work but it doesnt if you check out Sony Ericssons own site it will tell you that J220a doesnt have USB compatibility, I found this out later, fortunately I got an excellent seller on here who worked with me the whole way and even sent me another product to try but still didnt work, in the end I got a refund so no probs with the seller."
1,"I can't use dough hooks to make dough, and I searched web, no video showed it can make a bread dough","how to use dough hook to make a bread dough, like stand mixer, i am wondering that the dough hooks of hand mixer can't do that. Someone can be help to upload video to show how to make dough using hand mixer?"
5,Thank goodness!,"This is a wonderful attachement to have. I have a cookie recipe that I was never able to mix in my Cusinart (yes I know that is not what it is for) and had to resort to hand mixing. When making large batches it can be so very tiring but no MORE! This worked wonderfully and will get use for every dough recipe I can come up with! If you get the Kitchenaid Hand Mixer for yourself or as a gift, please add these on! :)"
5,A great option that fits all Kitchenaid hand mixers,"Contrary to how myKitchenAid Khm7twh 7 speed Hand Mixer khm7t khm7 white + Dough hookswas described, it arrived sans kneading hooks. Thank heavens Kitchenaid accessories are widely avialable and fit virtually all of of their hand mixers. I'd already purchased aKitchenAid Hand Mixer Stainless Steel Pro Whiskwhich was a delight to use and now I have these kneading hooks. I'd attempted using a Sunbeam stand mixer to whip up pasta dough and quickly realized its limitations. I know now that myKitchenAid Khm7twh 7 speed Hand Mixer khm7t khm7 white + Dough hookswould have been the way to go as it has the ability to work the dough in a way the Sunbeam just can't. These are nice and strong, well constructed, and worthy of the Kitchenaid name. In some respects I don't know why I relied on a lesser stand mixer and didn't opt for the tried and true Kitchenaid. If you have any qualms lay them to rest as these are the real deal!"
5,I want to go,"When I first started to read this book (first page)I thought it might be just to mind boggeling. The first few paragraphs were unclear to me. By end of page 2 I was thoroughly hooked. It is a story about an Aboriginal female who is brought to the son, of a criminal sent to Australia from England, as he is looking for a full time companion during his long days and nights caring for thousands of sheep. She is scared to death, she can't understand his language, and he doesn't understand anything she tries to say. Over a long period of time she learns to speak pidgon english and he learns to understand. They have children of their own, and a long history of the family unfolds in all its glory and excitement. This one of the best books I have read. And that is more than a thousand. Give it a go you'll not be disappointed."
4,outback,"This is a wonderful story about an aboringal girl named Mayrah who was traded away to a white man named Patrick Garrity,how they made a life together through incredible hardship, and eventually raised a family and became land barons of the Australian Outback. It is a sad and heroic novel that will keep you turning the pages as each character unfolds and crosses paths with Mayrah and Patrick Garrity, its a love story and a very compelling look at the life and challengers of living or running a sheep station. I will definately read other books from this author and hope they are as good as this one, well done growing up in Australia and visiting a sheep station in my childhood I especially can relate to the isolation these people endured although today life is so much easier than they ever knew."
5,Great Old-Fashion Family Movie,"This has always been one of my faviorite Lassie movies. The music and senery is beautiful. It is sort of sad in some places and can give you the shivers with all the tension of getting Lassie out of the old-abondon well in time, but otherwise very good movie with exclent object lessons about death, life, love, and God. It is very touching and will bring tears to your eyes. Wish that I could find this one in DVD."
4,Amazing Art Could Be Given More Page Space Though,"I am in awe of Lawrence Alma-Tadema as an artist. His work is simply amazing. My only complaint with this book, and the only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I wish they had given the artwork more page space in general. Some images are large but many times they crowd the art so they can fit in more text. Personally while the text can be very informative I wish that more of the images were 2 page spreads or just generally larger on the page. If you like reading about the paintings as much as looking at them then this might not be an issue for you."
4,Excellent coverage of this Victorian Painter,"I am a big fan of narrative painting. Paintings that tell a story. Alma--Tadema is an excellent painter. Despite that his Romans look like Britons, his historical and Roman era paintings are wonderful vignettes."
5,BEAUTIFUL,"THE BEST MOVIE I HAVE SEEN IN A LONG WHILE. MARLO THOMAS IS SO GOOD, YOU FORGET SHE IS PLAYING A PART. ANY ONE WHO HASN'T SEEN THIS, SHOULD GET IT. YOU WON'T BE DISSAPOINTED"
5,BEAUTIFULLY DONE FILM,Marlo Thomas is heartbreaking as a mentally ill woman who is misdiagnosed with schizophrenia as a teenager but who is helped by a caring psychiatrist and eventually triumphs over her illness. This is a very emotionally affecting movie. The acting is superb by all. I was very moved by Marlo Thomas' performance as someone who struggles & perseveres to overcome under the most harrowing of circumstances where she was so overmedicated with the wrong medication that she was unable to walk or talk. Her progress and recovery is amazing and inspiring. Lee Grant did a remarkable job of directing. Cried a lot during this movie. I highly recommend it.
2,Cut very small,"I can not even use this hat because it is too small. I have a ""normal"" sized head for a female and the medium barely covered the tops of my ears. While running it was trying to jump off my head. Get it if you have a small head or get it a lot larger than you normally need it."
3,Evie,"Evie is a girl that lives in the country that there family raises chickens. In the book Deliver Us From Evie she is a transfer student and now goes to Duffon High School. She lives in Mississippi and lives on a ranch. In the book Evie and her dad are closer together then the rest of the family. I know this because on of Christmas, when Evie's dad and mom were passing out gifts, her dad wanted to wait and her mom didn't. When it was Valentine's Day, Evie was in the shower and her mom said, ""Hurry up"". So when she was still in the shower her mom went to go look for the gifts, and her mom stumbled over a gift that said, ""To Angel from Evie, I love you."" When her mom found this she ask Evie, and Evie came out and said that ""I'm gay""."
3,Not Much Evie,"This story in this book is told from the perspective of Evie's younger brother. The majority of the tale is about how no one in their poor family is really happy in their small town or on their farm, so all three kids are making life plans to leave. About a third of the narrative is actually about Evie and her lesbianism/coming out via a relationship with the local bank owner's daughter.This book is very well written, but I think the author took the lesbian stereotype too far with Evie. Also, because it is told by her brother, the book doesn't deal too well with Evie's own journey into herself. If you are a young person with someone close to you who has just come out (to the world or even to just you), this book is a good place to start learning how to provide support. If you're into your 20's or older, there are far better books available to help you deal with this subject."
2,"GREAT AUTHOR, BAD BOOK","I have a read a few other ME Kerr books and they have been great, but I am sorry to say that book was horrible. There were some good parts in the book but it is simply boring and 95% conversation. The book was lacking plot and excitement. I would have given it one star but I respect ME Kerr too much. Her other books are some of my favorites but this one is definitly her worst piece of work."
3,Not so much about Evie,"While the title would imply that this novel was about Evie, it really is about Parr, a young man struggling with his desire to get off the farm, have a girlfriend and deal with his family. Evie is really a secondary character, and one that is pretty one-dimensional. Evie and her girlfriend fall into the butch femme stereotype and never grow past it. As far as being an accurate portrayal of what it is like to be gay in a small town, I don't think so. Both sets of parents took the affair between the girls pretty mildly and seemed to give up protesting all together when they ""proved"" they really wanted to be together.If you are looking for a good, realistic depiction of lesbian relationships, read something else."
4,A Good Starting Place..,"After reading some of the reviews, I feel I have to defend one of my favorite books, so here it goes:""Deliver Us From Evie"" is one of the first lesbian novels that I've read and enjoyed. I liked Evie as a character and found her intriguing. Though I wish that the book was through her point of view instead of her brother's, I feel that looking at homosexuality through the eyes of an onlooker is a good start for people curious or interested in learning about homosexuality, but not ready to read about it first hand. From this book, I moved on to more in depth books such as, 'Annie on My Mind' and 'Good Moon Rising',but I still look back at 'Deliver Us From Evie' as one of my favorites.P.S. For those who protest Evie being too masculine, well as Evie herself said, some of them DO look it."
4,Definetly 4 Star rating!,"I found Deliver Us from Evie a quick read that gave me a better portrayal of being a lesbian/gay in a typical small town. With many books, I find my mind wandering off to thinking about something else while reading words on a page, and that&#65533;s all it ends up being is words on a page. This book mostly grabbed my attention with only a few times where I found myself getting anxious for the end. I did, however, finish to the last word and I was glad I did. For all those people who are in a similar situation could benefit from reading this book to gain strength they may need. Overall I think the author was trying to send the message of being true to yourself because there will always be a way to find your happiness."
4,Very good.,"One of the things I liked most about 'Deliver Us From Evie' was it's length. I sat down and read it in one sitting, and once finished, the book left me feeling satisfied. I've noticed a couple of the other customer reviews saying there was not enough about Evie in the book. While the title may suggest the book is primarily about her, it does deal with Parr's life as well. Some other lesbian books I've read deal solely with the relationship, and I do enjoy those type immensely, but this book was a nice change. It gave some good insight into the minds of those close to a coming-out lesbian. While M.E.Kerr may have gone a bit far in stereotyping Evie, she was still an enjoyable character."
2,Kerr's Usual Intrigue is Missing,"Deliver Us from Evie, about a mid-western rural family's struggles with saving the farm, kids leaving the homestead, and lesbianism is the story told by first person narrator, 15 year old Parr. His sister Evie, an excellent mechanic and farmer, is useful to the family farm because of her skills, but her sexual preference creates for the family many financial problems including a scandalous affair with the daughter of the town's prominent banker causing a threat to the farm's existence. This story is about stereotypes; I just cannot figure out who is doing the stereotyping--Evie's family members or the author, M. E. Kerr, including the notion that fundamental Christians who are trailer park dwellers are ""holy rollers"" and are likely to show intolerance."
1,Try a different book.,"If you're looking for a coming out story, this is it. If you're looking for a coming out story with a plot and realistic characters, this is NOT it. The characters, especially the main ones, are stereotypically flat. Even Evie, who should be the focal point, is never fully brought to life. Yes, she dresses masculine and she likes mechanical stuff, but who is she? What makes her fall in love with Patsy and Patsy with her? You'll never find out by reading this."
4,A girl named Evie who was different and farmed like a guy,"This story was about a girl named Evie who was different from many others. She got teased about looking like a boy. Her family had a farm and Evie would do mostly all of the work. She would always dress like a boy. Everyone would tell her to dress like a woman, but she really didn't want to. Her brother Parr would get embarrassed from her looking like a guy. The kids at school would call her a boy. Then comes the Duffs family,who owned the majority of the land, and many buildings. As you can see this story includes stereotyping. It is certainly worth reading, and shows you the difference between families."
1,Frightening Tale,"I had this gut of a feeling while reading this book. Although I have nothing against ""alternatives"" this book was just too much for me. I was surprised to find how disturbed about this book I was, I'm one who doesn't find Stephen King, Ann Rice, nor any of the bunch scary...but THIS, was scary."
4,Great 80's Hair Metal with good hooks,"This band had three releases, with this one being their major debut. Their Ep, Cry In the Night is amazing (think Ozzy's Bark At The Moon, where every song is as good as Bark at the Moon), if you can find it, buy it. This follow up is very strong, but more commercial sounding. The bands foundation is based on the guitarist Terry Dunn, who hails from the Randy Rhodes school (as oppossed to the Van Halen school). His riffs are very solid, landing in Ozzy/early Crue land. The solo's as mentioned, are very much Randy Rhodes styled, which is a very good thing. The second foundation is the singer, Tommy Lee Flood. His voice is similar to Vince Neil, but much better. His tone is a lot stronger and his range is greater, without resorting to a nasal falsetto, as Vince does. He also posses an amazing scream, which is where I assume the band gets their namesake. The prices for the CD is a bit high, but this is a great release if you can find it on a d/l."
3,very interesting,"a must for ammatures. a very interesting book, though seemingly simple. ever wanted to be a ""mad scientist"" but didn't know where to start? this is the book for you, though it may seem abstract fromm the mad scientist bit."
1,Don't Waste your Money,"I bought this camera for my daughter. She got one set of pictures from the roll sent with the camera. After that the camera is useless. There is no counter so you don't know when the roll is finished. The film advance stops and the camera won't allow you to take more pictures so you assume the roll is finished because there is no other indication the roll is finished. When we open up back to get the roll out, the film is stuck in the middle and the roll is destroyed by exposure. This camera was a great diappointment for my daughter. Don't buy it."
1,Mine were NOT Lycra,"I ordered three and got them today. I ordered the following, all size small. Black, White, and Royal Blue. This is what I got...Black - ""100% Polyester. Made in China"".White - ""100% Nylon. Assembled in Mexico.""Royal Blue - ""90% Nylon. 10% Elasthan. Made in China.""That was on the labels sewn into the back of each.Although they were thongs and the size and color were correct, they were different styles and NOT as pictured in addition to not being made of Lycra."
1,worest thing i got.,ok the packed said XL. order said XL i got lager. same color shipped late wasn't happy. hand wash if got the time. wasn't happy.
1,Easy to understand for laymen,"The book is easy to understand for laymen. You can read the author's explanation of thermodynamics without any background in science. However, you still will not know if you understand thermodynamics.Consider the vast oceans which cover our planet. Water is H2O. Can you explain why water has not broken down into hydrogen and oxygen gas, which are simpler molecules? If you cannot answer this question is 2 seconds flat, you do not understand thermodynamics."
1,Staggering ignorance,"This book proves much, but not in the way its author intended.Instead of refuting evolution through a decidedly disingenuous ""conspiracy theory"" that all geology and most physical science are contrived constructs to support evolution, this book simply proves that religious extremism continues to be the enemy of knowledge. Any person with a relatively basic background in science can readily decipher the lies and distortions presented.In the place of combatting ignorance, a reading of this book compounds it. The author makes his his mind up at the start, and in a collection of faulty syllogisms and ignorance of reality, simply shows that lack of understanding in a field comprises no basis upon which to explain it. Save both your time and money, and read something productive and logical."
3,Did man pop out of the blue?,"Fisrt of all i dont know that much about science But i do know that scientist can lie to support there beleif. All they have are a bunch of ""THEORIES"". The theory of evolution was proven faulty from 1962-1975. But the average person doesnt know that, so they are easily tricked. the colapse of evolution hits it on the mark."
3,"Definitely not the best apologetics books, but interesting...",Definitely not the best apologetics books...but interesting if your new to Christianity.
1,this book may have cursed me,"i had a conversation about evolution with my uncle last year. he's a fundamentalist/creationist. i'm, to say the least, not. after ranting for about an hour, he gave me this book. i suppose he thought that since i wasn't arguing with him, that maybe i could be convinced. i can't, and especially not with vapid, manipulative garbage like this. i had to decline, and now there's a theological/social rift between us. all because of this stupid book."
1,To July 7 2002 commentator,"The ""why are there still monkeys"" question is one of the most ignorant questions to ask when discussing evolution theory. even those who have taken the time to gain even an elementary understanding of the theory would know that there existed an ape/human progenitor, before humans OR apes. Men did not come from monkeys, but an ancestor which led to the creation of both. This book, which encourages such ideas, is equally full of ignorance and general misunderstanding of the science and theory."
1,Nonsensical garbage,"This book ignores facts and leads you to believe that what it says is right. It doesn't, it ignores what science knows and presents irrelevent arguements, for example, it claims that the mississippi delta could have formed in 5000 years. That's true, but what exactly does that have to do with the age of the Earth? The mississippi could have formed after Earth. see http://wiki.cotch.net/index.php/The_Collapse_of_Evolution for more refutations of this book.Pure garbage, be sure to think critically when reading a book like this, don't just take some author's word as fact! please!"
5,Excellent,A nice summary refutation of the bankrupt philosophy of macro-evolution. The tough questions asked in this book lead to the strong feelings against this book by the followers of the religion of evolution.
1,What was he smoking ?,"What a load of unmitigated tripe !As another reviewer stated, (mis)quote mining at its best.This surely demonstrates the dishonesty associated with these lunatic young earth 'creationist' types.""Lying for Jesus"" at its best.Its not evolution that has collapsed, rather 'creationist' integrity.Whatever he was smoking, its powerful stuff.Save your money and go for a good read - maybe one of Richard Dawkins sensible and properly argued books.The only reason it has one star is that the review would accept unless it had at least one."
2,Not Much Here Except for Algren,"The only things worth reading in this collection are the introduction and the last story, both written by Algren. The other stories as the previous reviewer has pointed out either lack heavier weight or are poorly written. Most of the them have both of those detractors.Algren's ""House of a Hundred Grassfires"", the last story in the collection, is worth reading for the degradation of a priest and a naval officer.Overall, Algren would have been better off selling the story as part of his own collection or as a pamphlet. The other stories in ""Lonesome Monsters"" are not worth your time."
1,"Self serving, shallow","Of course, there is utility value in the practice of lying. Everyone knows that, especially children who have not yet learned they are not the only one on the planet, and their self serving rationalizations for not telling the truth are subscribed to by few. The author seems to think that applying moronic wit to the lies he perceives as being all around him somehow makes them OK, harmless, even essential in the functioning of society. This point of view, based on a level somewhere between an elementary school playground and a middle school boy's locker room, is disturbing, particularly coming from an educator. The alternative view, and, to (hopefully) most of us, is that those who trumpet dishonesty are best paid no mind."
2,ALL KIMONO TYPE CLOTHES PATTERNS,"THIS BOOK SHOWS YOU HOW TO MAKE KIMONO TYPE JACKETS AND COATS,ETC. IF YOU ARE INTO THIS YOU'LL LIKE IT, I AM NOT INTO THIS TYPE OF LOOK SO I FEEL LIKE I WASTED MY MONEY ON THIS BOOK! THEY ARE VERY SIMPLE PATTERNS."
2,As good as my old ones,"All three batteries worked, but they all had the power curve of nearly expired batteries--battery power indicators decreased faster than normal until half gone, then dropped to ""battery dead"" abruptly."
4,Nokia Battery,"The Nokia battery overall works well, and keeps a good charge. It does not keep as good of a charge as the original battery that came with the phone."
4,battery review,i got it as quick as ups goes from CA to AL. so far the one that is being used is working fine. at least this battery is one that is being phased out so it did not cost me $50.
2,"Order not complete, poor customer service","The movie itself is great, my son loves it. BUT, it was supposed to come with a book. I opened the package, no book. OK, maybe it is a small paper back book in the DVD case...no book. I contacted the company and they said I would have to ship back the DVD so they could ship me back the DVD with the book, instead of them just shipping me the book. I already opened it and my son has already been watching it. I was disappointed because he LOVES Noddy."
2,Very disappointed,"My family has recently moved to New Zealand and discovered the Noddy series. My two and three year old children just love it. I was having some stuff sent over from the states and bought this DVD to be sent over. We were so disappointed to start watching it and find that they had replaced the all the characters British accents with American sounding voices.It is just not the same as the original, it lost so much of the charm. Still great stories though."
4,A star is reborn,"I've been a fan of S Club since there were 7 of them. After the split, Rachel came out with a very strong record and I was wondering what happened to the others. Finally Stuart's album is here!The Clubbers have been gone so long I forgot just how happy his voice sounds. Leaving Songs delves into the many stages of love and heartbreak, with some tunes actually co-written by Stuart himself. These beautiful ballads are produced and arranged perfectly, well done son, and hopefully this means you won't have to embarrass yourself in any more Cif adverts."
3,Okay for a while,"We had this toaster for 2 years before the lever stopped working. It toasted okay, evenly most of the time, sometimes burning a little or not toasting enough. Nice looking, good shape taking up little space. Looking for a new toaster now - no consistent reviews on any brand."
2,"not pleased, looking for another","I bought this toaster last year. I really haven't been happy. It takes too long to heat. My son jacks up the setting, then pops the toast early to get the toast to toast. I love kitchenaid, but not this one."
3,"No ""Easy Lift""","As a toaster it works fine; particularly for the long slices of bread from a round home baked loaf.The advertised ""Easy Lift"" feature feature, however, was very disappointing. We envisioned a quiet gentle lift of the toaster bar - instead, once the toast is finished it rises with a ""Clang"" loud enough to wake the dead, or at least people sleeping nearby."
1,Won't pop down most of the time,Not really happy with the unit. Was bad out of the box. Had in box for 3 months so we could not return it. Very unhappy with it.
1,Mixers yes. Toasters NO!,"KitchenAid has replaced our toaster FIVE times. When we get a new (probably rebuilt) one, it works great. Even toasting, etc. After a very short while, the ""up/down"" switch won't catch. It starts by being difficult, then won't work at all. This has been a consistent problem with each and every one. The current replacement started earlier this week. This morning, it won't catch at all. I made my toast in the oven broiler. I am here today to find another toaster."
1,Can't toast an English Muffin,"The only bread that it toasted acceptably was thin-sliced white bread. Would not brown an english muffin or whole-wheat bread, even at highest setting. Tried two toasters---neither one worked."
1,Do not choose this toaster!,"Two major flaws....1- this toaster does not hold 4 regular pieces of bread, unless they are small square shaped slices. To be fair, it will hold two sliced bagels.2- after about a year, the on/off sliding mechanism started to go belly up. Now it will only engage after ~10 attempts, including a lot of superstitious unplugging and re-plugging, pushing the test and reset button on the outlet, and bopping the side of the toaster (as you would an old TV set)."
2,"Nice, but doesn't toast evenly","This could be a fluke toaster, but it doesn't toast evenly from one end to the other. I have had Kitchen Aid toasters before and loved them. But this one needs some help."
2,"Ya Win Some, Ya lose Some ... I lost this one!","I read tons of reviews for numerous toasters and this one seemed to have a 50-50 shot at being one of the best, based on the most current reviews. The negative 50 was uneven browning and burnt toast; the positive 50 was perfect toast.The size and shape met my needs and since most of the negatives were dated some time ago, so I figured (hoped) that KitchenAid had improved the design. I was wrong.Burnt toast (on ONE side). Uneven browning. I guess I got one of the negative models. Would I buy again? Not this model.*UPDATE* I did contact KitchenAid and they very nicely replaced this toaster with a different model, which works just fine. My faith in KitchenAid has been restored (Not my faith in this model ... just my faith in KitchenAid!)"
2,Disapointed with KitchenAid,"The toaster does not seem to cool well between repeated toasting cycles (only 2-3). With the heat control kept the same, the second toasting is much darker than the first and the third will be almost burned."
5,KTT5700B 4 slice Digital toaster,"We took delivery of our toaster several weeks ago. It seems to be operating as described. Actually, for us it does not show the negatives of some of the blogs we had read. We have tried bagels, frozen waffles, and regular toast 2 and 4 slices. All worked well. The digital settings seem consistant and non varying. We like the AC cord storage feature on the bottom of the toaster. Assuming, over time, it has durability, we would purchase again."
1,Lousy Toaster,I had this toaster for over two years. We used it about 10 times each week. The toast was never consistently browned. Sometimes it was burned on one edge and white on the other. And one day it just refused to work. We bought a cheap Black & Decker which makes nice evenly colored toast. What a concept. Wish I could give 0 stars for the kitchen aid lemon.
3,"My favorite author, poorly spelled","I have always loved Dave Duncan, and while this is not his best series, I do still enjoy it. I first read it years ago when I borrowed them from the library. I was excited to see a reprint of the series available (Dave Duncan books are so hard to find in used book stores). Unfortunately, this edition is SO poorly edited I almost returned the books. I could not go more than 2 pages without finding a typo, some of them so jarring that I had to stop and think about what the word was supposed to be (someone must have done a Find and Replace on THE to change it to ME, because in book 3 this typo exists no fewer than 25 times).I guess my review is more a reflection of the general failings of the publishing industry in this day of reliance on spell check. In general, an enjoyable series and a good way to spend a rainy afternoon. Just as long as you don't mind being brought back from your fantasy world to figure out what something was supposed to say."
1,Don't bother starting this series.,"Dave Duncan's wonderful series, ""A Man of His Word"", ended very well. So well, in fact, that one doesn't need this contrived story to continue the storyline. This book starts another 4-book series that picks up about 15 years after the previous series. This book actually deserves 2-3 stars, but the ending to the series is SO bad, that one shouldn't even begin it. Yes, it really is that bad. Book four deserves negative points, were it possible."
4,When R&B was something special,"With the founding father of R&B groups New Edition doing the solo thing in the early nineties and Boyz II Men still a year or so away, Troop was the premire R&B group of 1990. The songs Spread My Wings, All I Do Is Think Of You and I Will Always Love are some of the best songs to come out of early 90's R&B and the boys earned their spot in R&B in my opinion."
5,Talk about MEMORY lane!,"Before there were New Kids, NSync, Backstreet Boys, 98 Degrees, O-Town, there was Troop. These cats gave 120 percent in their performances with two powerhouse lead vocalists and dancing that had you out of breath just from watching.Troop laid the foundation for singing/dancing boy groups of today. While Boyz II Men were more conservative, Troop had a street-flavored edginess that has never been duplicated. (oh groups today are TRYing but they can't hold a candle to Troop)Chuckii Booker produced alot of the funky tracks on this album. ""Spread My Wings"" was a super hit, and ""I Will Always Love You"" was a serious slow jam. The remake of ""All I Do is Think of You"" (also performed by the Jackson5)is a sentimental serenade that will take you even further down memory lane.This is vintage ""old skool"" that will have you reaching for Care Free Curl spray, white socks & penny loafers, and your old parachute pants with the zippers on the side!Peace. CLB."
5,troop,I just feel like dancing! It takes me back to when me and my girlswere hanging out at the club.
3,Troop,I was in college when Troop was big. Their music has held up pretty well over the years. These guys were great!!
4,memories,"this is the beginnig of r&b for me, it really brings back a lot of good memories when i had it on tape and listened to it all day together with guy were these the only two r&b albums on the dutch market......great"
4,"..the fast jams seem out of vogue, now, but....","...four stars for ""Spread My Wings"" and ""All I Do is Think of You"". Great songs."
4,One of the all time greats,"If you like 80's R and B and don't know who these guys are, you are missing out! Highly recommend this album. It's got upbeat R and B and soothing songs as well. Love it. Great buy and better music."
3,Mildly entertaining and funny for PG Martin Lawrence,"I was worried that Martin Lawrence might be a little to unfunny for me considering this was his first PG rated movie. But he actually was quite amusing and had some laughable one-liners. I definitely prefer the R-rated Lawrence, but it's always nice to see an actor pull off something different.He seems to do better at ""transforming"" to PG movies better than Eddie Murphy. I'm really starting to lose interest in Murphy. He just can't do PG movies with the humor I like compared to Lawrence.But anyway...this movie is cute and amusing for the whole family. The kids show off some great physical humor. Don't buy into the critics telling you this is a dopey, basketball comedy. This is a nice, enjoyable movie for Lawrence fans and children alike. It may not be very original, but how many movies are!"
1,i hope people arent buying this,that would mean they have money to burn.funny thing is they would have a better time taking that $20 bill and setting it on fire.mar'in lawrence is done.he was semi funny on tv.that humor never showed up on the big screen.he depends on whatever cool phrase is being said by jr highschoolers and MTV cliches.he is just a horrible actor whose time has passed 15 years ago.RIP mar'in
3,good movie,"good movie, funny, i liked it because it you never knew what was going to happen next. very good movie"
4,Basketball movie for kids.,"Predictable, but heartwarming basketball movie for kids. Pro basketball player with an attitude on leave from team must coach losing kid's ball team."
3,Rebound...,Cute movie. There a few scenes that are unnecessary. Martin Lawerence can be so funny when he wants to be. The only problem is that he doesn't know how to clean up his language.
3,Shoot again...,"If you've picked up this Rebound then you need to shoot the ball again. It's off by quite a bit.I picked up this DVD as a huge Martin Lawrence fan but much of his infamous comedic style was missing. I laughed once, maybe twice and that is unheard of while watching Martin Lawrence.The storyline was full of holes. Of course we know Martin will connect with the kids, as well as Wendy Raquel Welch, as one of the kid's mother's but the journey there is uneventful. I found myself wondering did I blink and miss it when his attitude turned around.It's a watchable movie but certainly not one of Martin's best."
2,Formula Picture,"I'm sorry but my ten year old found this too predictable. Martin Lawrence has his funny moments, but this was kind of too wacky. No believable human relationships in this one."
5,This is a great movie!,"I thought I was the only one that loved this movie, but reading other reviews I see I am not alone. It's a family movie, a bit unrealistic, but so are most movies. Here are a bunch of teen-agers that don't use any vulgar language; no sexual suggestions and it's funny! Steve Martin is hilarious in his part as Coarch Roy and the character Keith is charming with a winning smile. I've watched this movie about 3 times and would love to see a sequel. . . but sequels usually are not as good."
3,Cute Family Tale!,"When hot shot college basketball coach Roy McCormick has a meltdown on the court, he's bannished to coach a group of underachievers at his former junior high school. This was a surprizing funny film that isn't full of foul language or tasteless humor. Martin Lawrence shows he can give laughs without being vulgar. Good entertainment for the whole family!"
3,I got a copy from chinatown,"I got a copy of this movie in Chinatown and it worked well. It was a cute comedy and it made you want to cheer. I love basketball and I saw this and it was okay. Kids like me will love this, well some. I`m 10."
4,1927,"I really like the songs on this cd. As a young child when these songs were mostly played, it shows that some of the older hits are timeless.I still find these songs to be modern in an old way-"
2,Advantage grade parts in a Professional grade package,"This is the second time, from the second vendor (this time Amazon), where I have bought these sleeves only to find out that they are just the cheap ""Advantage"" grade sleeves packaged in the ""Professional"" grade boxes. They don't look like the picture, the sleeve itself is a straight smooth threaded shaft that has no guides for the clamps and a cheap coating that rusts quickly. If you want a good quality sleeve, buy from a brand like Moog, and if you just want cheap, get the Advantage version of this which is the same thing at less than half the price."
5,Extreme and Functional,"What can you really say about a general bowling bag? It works, has enough room for a ball, shoes, and a towel. Its cool looking, turning all those league bowlers heads as I walk by."
4,Jam201,"Very nice cd! Maysa and Phil Jackson are beautiful on Angel. Another favorite is Blow Like The Wind. If you like smooth jazz, you will like this cd."
4,"Man, I miss bands like this!","If you missed out on these guys back in the day and can appreciate good, hard driving chord-based hard rock, then take a chance and go for this. If you dig old Dokken, XYZ, and Hurricane, then you will probably appreciate the fun contained on this disc. I think these guys were way underrated. Trust me, great guitar!"
5,Great service!,I was satisfied with this product and it came on time for when my class started. I also found the review of the book condition to be spot on!
5,Beyond Words--Lucid's talent is unreal!!,"This album is truly beyond words. A mixture of raw talent and music from the heart, a purchase you definitely will not regret."
2,Won't play home made dvd's,At first I was so happy with the unit. I found no problem with set up or using the remote. Playing regular store bought DVD's worked good. On one older DVD it freezed in the middle of a DVD but only 1/2 of the time and the VHS was flawless. Then my daughter was in a dance performance and we got a copy made from a recording company on DVD. First it would play a couple mins then freeze. After trying a few times it wouldn't even read the DVD and would just say error. After calling JVC he tried to walk me through resetting the machine but it wouldn't reset so I sent it back.
1,DON'T BUY IT!!,"I used the DVD player twice, and it no longer will recognize any disc. After going in circles with tech support, I was finally told I need to (take time off from work to) bring it down to the service center and pay $70 for them to fix it (since its 8 months old, more than the 3 months warranty on LABOR). Since I could buy a new DVD unit for $50, I can't see the point. I'm VERY disappointed and unhappy with their product and with their committment to service (or lack thereof)."
1,Pathetic,"So far I'm pretty disgusted with this unit. I think I played one DVD on it. It did sit for a few months without use, and when I came back, the unit will no longer recognize any disc at all. JVC web site is completely useless. Now I have to waste time bringing the unit to a service center. We'll see if they'll cover the warranty. Since its longer than three months, I'm sure they'll charge me labor. What a scam!! Don't waste your money!"
1,I will never buy a JVC product again.,Is the worse buy in my life. The DVD does not work and to get a new one is cheaper than repair. JVC Colombia unable to fix it.
1,Very disappointed - Not a good buy,"After about six months, had the same problems as other buyers - DVD player freezes. Sometimes restarts, sometimes doesn't. Emailed their customer service, but only got a line that my warrenty was up. There must be some systemic problem with how JVC is putting these together - I can't believe they don't know this. In either case, I have given up on using it as a DVD player and I'm in the market for a new one. Of course, I will never again be purchasing anything JVC."
2,A letdown,"Something happened when EBTG was dropped by Sire and went to Atlantic. This disc and Baby the Stars Shine Bright are radio-poppy and seem tailored to European audiences. These discs simply lack the swing feel of the first record and the rock push of the second. Idlewild restored my faith. Save your time and money and try to find a copy of Tracey's record, ""A Distant Shore,"" on Cherry Red, from 1983 or thereabouts."
5,I LOVE THIS ALBUM,"Where Don't let the teardrops rust your shining heart was an introduction to their music, the language of life is where their truths are revealed.Poignant, Sad, Real, and Beautifully crafted: this album is a classic in itself. Tracks like, meet me in the morning, drving, and language of life shows how uch this duo had been so underrated.It remains to this day one of my favorite albums. It stood the test of time years and years later."
5,A Truly Beautiful Work!!!,"When I first decided to explore the works of Everything But The Girl, I was looking for an artist that compared to Swing Out Sister. I was not disappointed with this CD. The songs that I love in particular are ""Driving"",and especially the title song, ""Language of Life."" However, the whole CD is so very beautiful and it is truly comparable to all of the Swing Out Sister works that I so adore. I recommend this artist and in particular this CD very Highly."
2,"Great band, weak record","I love EBTG, and I've loved nearly everything they've ever done - ever since the first album (Eden, or Everything But The Girl here in the States).But this was by far their weakest album. Much of it is adult-contemoporary slop. It's so overproduced that it hides Tracey's magnificent voice.It has the worst song Ben and Tracey ever wrote, the earnest, finger pointing ""Me and Bobby D.""The truly redeeming song here is ""Driving,"" one of their finest songs ever (and a great video as well)."
5,Amazing CD,"I am a big fan of Everything But the Girl. This CD is a great listen. The music is catchy and fun. I especially like ""Driving"" which got quite a bit of radio play on stations broadcasting easy listening songs. Try it... I think you'll enjoy it!"
3,Not for short-haired cats,"I read the reviews prior to buying this item, as well as the product description, and no where did it indicate that it is for long-haired cats. Please note, this product is really not meant for short-haired cats and is very uncomfortable for them. The tines can be quite sharp and if your cat doesn't have a lot of hair protecting the body, it can be very scratchy for them.My kitten absolutely hates it and won't let it near him and he is a fairly mellow kitty who lets me clip his nails and pet him no problem. I only wish that information was made more clear in the product description. If you are looking for a brush for a short-haired cat, check out one of the ones with the rubber nubs/bristles or gloves that use static electricity to draw out excess hair, not these sharp, uncomfortable slickers."
3,The cats tolerate it...,"Actually, one of my cats actually purrs the whole time I brush him. My other cat doesn't much like it, but tolerates a few brushes then runs away. He is a Maine coon though, so it didn't surprise me. I'd like the brush better is it wasn't quite as wide; it's hard to do much but their backs, tummy and sides with this large brush. Now if I can only buy a product that motivates the cat owner to brush everyday."
5,Love This Brush!,"This brush really gets the fur off my cats much better than other brushes or other slicker brushes. The cats love it too, it really is very gentle. Even the ones that don't like to be brushed will put up with this brush. Definitely worth the money!"
4,Better than the Furminator,I tried the FURminator and my cats hated it. Contrary to reviews the Furminator did not work well and I had to use a lot of pressure to make it pick up any hair at all. I was so disappointed. So I bought the Ultimate Touch Gentle Slicker. What a huge difference! The Ultimate touch works great and I don't have to press hard to rake it through my cats hair. Now my cats don't run away from me when I try to brush them.
5,my cat loves it!,"my cat doesn't always enjoy being petted and cuddled since he is the playful type, but he will sit there and let me brush him with this for a long time, he really likes it. This brush is excellent at removing fur, thus reducing shedding, hairbulls, and clumps in his fur. It is a simple brush that has easy cleaning, and the best thing i like about the brush is that it was at an affordable price!"
5,Quite an accomplishment!,"Creating the human figure in art is hard enough with paint or clay let alone 3D software. In his new book, 3-D Human Modeling and Animation, 2nd Edition, Peter Ratner builds the reader up to the task by introducing the concepts with simple, easy to construct models, then simple characters and finally the human figure. By the end of the book your models will be walking and talking. Quite an accomplishment."
1,I HATE THIS VACUUM!,I have about 1000 SF of normal carpet. The auto height adjustment goes UP and DOWN constantly and cannot find the correct height. Its almost impossible to push and pull for my wife. Theres nothing broken. I disconnected the wire to the adjuster at its highest and it still drags SO hard. Its just a POORLY designed OVERPRICED headache and Im throwing it in the dumpster as soon as Im done writing this. This vacuum SUCKS very well
5,Just Magnificent!!,"I am a fan of Anthony Newman, having many of his organ recitals as well as piano and other keyboard works. When I got this one, it completes my collection of the Beethoven Piano Concertos in this series. Overall, I enjoy his interpretation better than any of my other ones, I think. His style brings new pleasure in listening to familiar things. I will not get rid of my other sets, but this sure is at the top.Many reviews find fault with Newman and his playing. I am not a theorist, but just a listener. His playing is magic, and should be sought out."
4,MUST for serious deep sky observer,"This book explains the view of numerious deep sky objects through 60mm, 150mm and 200-250mm scopes. The explanations are helpful in finding the objects in the field. However; although introductory chapters may be helpful for beginners, this book is for intermediate or advanced telescope users."
3,a good subs for wiki and a good summary,"I just finished reading this book to prepare for my tech interview. This book is a very good substitution for wikipedia on summary, and could be used for interview preparation. But that is it. A bit over simplified. The most annoying thing during reading was that, the referred diagrams are always at the next page or two pages after. Some paragraphs seemed written by some students' cut and copy from the net.(e.g. there is this term in short form being explained when it was mention in the second time not the first) Therefore, I recommend this book for interview preparation or very simple college review only."
5,Rest for those who offer rest to others.,"Dr. Jones has given professional caregivers permission to take the personal rest needed in order to help others find renewal and healing. He offers wisdom from personal experience combined with practical tools that offers relief from relational and institutional responsibilities. ""Rest in the Storm"" is a book that should become a requirement in seminaries and other universities that train people to be professional caregivers."
1,Non-existant service - hopefully replacement is good,"Well, I should have read the reviews here and other Haier products before I just submitted to Amazon for a replacement, and should have done a full return of this gift instead. My wife got this for my for Christmas and I just opened the box this morning. Lucky me two things happened this morning with the box: 1) it gets destroyed - there is almost no way not to have this happen, and 2) I tossed the box and all shipping pieces just minutes before my trash guys picked up all our trash this morning.Problem: The door has oil/grease dripping down the glass, between the panes. There is no way to fix this problem since I'm assuming the panes are sealed too for efficiency. [....][....]"
2,I was very disappointed.,"In comparison to the other books in the series, I was very disappointed by Murder in Moscow. The concrete reasons behind the murders were not sufficiently explored and the identity of the murderers were not uncovered. The book was extremely unsatisfying and I myself feeling cheated."
1,Disappointment abounds in this book,"I have found that most of the Murder, She Wrote series books are entertaining, and at times, somewhat believable. However, this one leaves much to be desired. As an admirer of the television series as well, I have a hard time swallowing this one - while fiction always, this one is quite the farce. I'm glad it wasn't the first one I read, it would probably have been the last."
2,NOT UP TO THE USUAL STANDARDS,"I LIKE MURDER MYSTERIES. I ENJOY TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHO THE MURDERER IS AND THEN SEEING IF I AM RIGHT WHEN THE BOOK FINALLY TELLS ME, BUT THIS TIME THEY NEVER DID SAY WHO WAS REALLY THE KILLER. WE WERE LEFT HANGING AT THE END. WHO WAS THE KILLER? DID SOMEONE TRY TO POISON JESSICA? WHAT HAPPENED TO THE GIRL? WAS SHE KILLED? WAS SHE STILL ALIVE? I WAS REALLY VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS STORY, AND I USUALLY JUST LOVE ALL ""THE MURDER SHE WROTE"" BOOKS. I REALLY LIKE JESSICA. PLEASE GO BACK TO THE OLD FORMAT OF STORIES"
2,Falty tale leads to disappointment,"I usually enjoy the MURDER SHE WROTE mysteries, but this one was a let down. I found a lot of incorrect details taking place during unrealistic scenes. While many murder mysteries can be unrealistic, this one was too much to take. I hope the next one is better!"
2,A confusing and frustrating book,"I have read almost all of the previous Murder she Wrote novels and found them very enjoyable, however the newest was a disapointment. The plot was extremly hard to follow and jumped randomly from one event to another. The book was frustrating and did not explian the events that took place in understandible detail. It resembelled a bad Cold War spy novel not fitting in with the usual writing style of this series. Although a would reccomend any other Murder She Wrote book, this one is not worth reading."
3,not up to expectations,"I looked foreward to reading this book very much. I am a fan of the television series and have at least enjoyed the previous books in the series. I was very disappointed with this story. The plot was poor, the situations totally implausible, and the whole thing was just very frustrating to me. I felt like the plot could be expanded in only a few pages and the rest was just filler. I will still look foreward to any new books in the series but I cannot recommend this one."
1,Murder in Moscow Murder to Take,"Having read all of the Murder, She Wrote books in this series so far, I have to wonder WHAT Donald Bain was thinking? This was far from being a whodunnit, and comes closer to a whydoesanyonecare? Bad plot, bad writing, disappointing and unappealing characters, murder victims you don't care about and would like to see the killer(s) get away with it. And last, but not least, Jessica stuck in an embarrassing Mrs. Pollifax rip-off. There are too many other stories in the series which are entertaining. Finally, Mr. Bain or his editors need to do more fact checking regarding series characters, history, names and certainly location."
1,No Closure,"I have bought several Murder, She Wrote books (most from Amazon), but I never felt the need to write a review for these books before, until now. Whilist the other books in the series are great, this one was a huge disappointment. It started out good, but left you hanging in the end. The murder(s) are never discovered. Two murders and and attempted third, and yet no one knows who committed them. I felt robbed, both of my money and of my time. I can always get more money, but I will never get the time I spent reading this back!"
3,Parapsychology review,"This book was pretty middle of the road. It gave a lot of old history about what some unknown scientists did to test theories in the 70s-80s that was pretty boring and dry. It had some good information in it also, but for the most part I could only give it a FAIR score of 3 stars. N. Passage"
2,Hoped it would be better,"I read good things about this toaster but it hasn't lived up to the hype. It doesn't toast consistently. If you toast 2 batches of the same bread at the same setting, one will come out o.k. and the next one will burn. The first toaster that I bought started to make a humming noise after about 2 months, so I called KitchenAid and they sent a new one. The new one toasts the same inconsistent way. Oh well, it looks nice next to my red KitchenAid food processor."
2,"started nicely, didn't last...","This toaster worked pretty well when we first received it, though it had problems with tall slices of bread. Laid on their sides, the tall slices were unevenly toasted. Shortly after the warranty expired, the toaster stopped popping up. even on very low settings, the toaster keeps toasting until it is manually stopped. It is now time to get a new one and it has only been a year and a half. I had my last toaster for six years and it was a quarter the price."
3,10-2 Ohio State vs. 11-3 Kansas St.,"Ohio State follows it's National Championship season with a steller 11-2 campaign completed with a 35-28 win over Big 12 Champ Kansas St.Though the final score indicates a close game it was clear Ohio State bagged this game when Krenzel throws a string tight pass to Santonio Holmes in the back of the endzone for a 35-14 lead 4th quarter lead.Days before kickoff Kansas State QB Ell Roberson was accused of sexual assualt, placing somewhat of a damper on Kansas State's game play and Snyder's only BCS appearence."
2,Redraw,"I was really excited to receive the book Women's Costume and soon was highly disappointed. The illustrations were not well drawn and the pictures were not as detailed as I had hoped. If you are looking just to get a general idea about costumes, this book is not the one for you. Overall, I would not recommend this book"
4,Wonderful Artist!,"I just recently discovered the music of Yulia Savicheva, and it's fantastic. I'm hoping to be able to hear more and find some way to obtain more of her CDs."
5,Simply Awesome!!!,"This item is a wonderful piece to have in any music collection, especially if you are an Atomic Kitten fan. The CD contains songs that were unreleased in the U.S. (then again, almost nothing of AK was released in the U.S.). The DVD containing both their Greatest Hits concert & Greatest Hits videos (all 18 of them) just adds to the overall quality of the product. The concert is delightful to watch, and the music videos... smokin'! A must have for all AK fans!!!"
4,Meow Re-mix,I am a complete slave to everything Atomic Kitten and many of their funnest tracks get an enjoyable jolt. ''Right Now'' and ''The Tide is High'' are spiffy and you need to own ''Locomotion'' but the real standout is the surprisingly tough''Eternal Flame''
5,A great album!,"This is one of the greatest albums of the 80's! Favorite songs: ""Everything that comes around"" and ""Write tonight""."
1,Disappointed,I bought this album (vinyl) shortly after it came out. I taped it and put it away. I don't think I listened to it more than a few times. I am currently digitalizing my LPs which are not offered by Yahoo Unlimited and was looking forward to giving this record another listen to. What a disappointment! The songs were weak and his voice is very thin and hard to listen to. I can't believe some guy said he has a great voice and compares him to David Gilmore. No way!! This album sucks.
1,It's just uninspired and forgetable,Mick Jones seem to put little effort in writing these songs. It's just uninspired and medocre. The songs goes right through your head without leaving any trace what so ever.Buy something else.
5,"Educational, fun toy",It's a great educational product suitable for grade schoolers. It may need some adult guidance during assembly and punching the pinhole. I recommend using a small cut up piece of aluminum can as pinhole section rather than the included foil. It's a fun introduction to film photography for all ages!
2,Not that great.,"The design is pretty good and the quality is not bad at all, however, the instructions for making the actual pinhole are not very detailed if you are a kid. They should specify the exact size of the required hole. Instead, they just tell you to take a needle and prick a hole through the center."
2,treats gospel of Thomas as authoritative,"The Gnostic gospel of Thomas is not in Protestant Bibles and is not in the Canon of Sacred Scripture established by the Roman Catholic Church. It is not even considered a good second tier historical writing because it includes Gnostic type sayings that are not consistent with Jesus.Yet, Craig Evans includes the Gospel of Thomas version of the parable of the wicked tenants (on page 217) and implies that it is more reliable (authentic) than the version in Mark 12 that he is commenting on."
5,The David Steinberg Show,"David Steinberg was one of my favorite comedians and when he got his own show I never missed it. Having the opportunity to watch the show now with my grown children and grandchildren has been such a treat. You can't believe how good it is to hear, ""Booga Booga"" coming from the living room while we are all cooking in the kitchen!"
2,Defective and returned,"I bought this unit to serve as a client to my existing wireless network, which is based on the excellent TrendNet TEW-630BRP. Through 3 days of trial and 50+ attempts in different settings, I succeeded in getting the two Ethernets bridged properly just twice. In both of these cases, the connections were lost within minutes. It then dawned on me that either the hardware or the software has to be defective. So, the unit was returned and I began to shop for a different model.The unit I had was Version A2.2. This might have been too new to have a stable firmware."
1,JVC HRS 5902 U Hi-Fi VCR,"I purchased this VCR on recommendation when my Sony SLV N900 performed like a piece of junk.I have had this JVC VCR for 2 weeks and I am very disappointed with it for the following reasons:1.- The Remote Control does NOT have an ""EJECT"" button nor does it have Hi-Fi receiver ""Volume"" conrtol capability(both, of which, are on my Sony VCR remote control.2.- For some reason, Channel 9 is weak and severely snowy but, JVC Corp. Consumer Service can not help correct the problem or will not!The reason for purchasing the JVC VCR was the fact that the remote control would not activate my Sony VCR. A big problem when using 2 Sony VCRs at the same time.Munufacturers of VCRs seem to be making their VCRs cheaper in quality to force consumers to buy their expensive DVRs,etc. Too bad that the F.C.C. doesn't step in to stop this kind of abuse!"
5,Outland,This CD is just terrific!!!!! Ed Schaefer has put together an amazing mix of instrumentals to reflect and ease day to day stress. This is a must have for anyone's collection!!!!
3,Reilly's Woman,"This is the story about a couple that end up surviving a plane crash in the Nevada desert. Leah is 22 years of age and Reilly is somewhere in his 30's. It is a story about survival, love and understanding about cultures. I liked this story because the hero and heroine don't try to make each other jealous with past or present lovers."
3,Wild Honey,"Nurse Randi Terhune has never had a husband or a lover. But she does have a wonderful son, Matt. She never thought she'd meet the boy's father.Ex-CIA agent Travis McLean has avoided paternity all his life. The Mclean family was virtually dysfunctional. Why would a family of his own be any different? But then he meets Matt, the image of himself as a youngster, and Randi, Matt's beautiful mother. Can he come to terms with the past to give them all a future?"
4,Great Gift,"This is much better than just giving a stuffed animal as a gift. It's got the little something extra. Gave a monkey to my nephew and an elephant to my niece. They both loved the animal, but loved it even better that they could go online and register a star in their name."
4,Haven't named a star yet,"We received this toy for our sons first birthday. The elephant itself is cute and cuddly, my wife was even more excited to name a star for our boy using one of his nicknames. However, the website always says Try Back Later- Out getting more stars. She checks everyday, who knows if that will ever happen. So, if you are looking to name a star I'd start wishing on them tonight."
4,Great 1-2 time costume use,"Very cute, reasonably priced.I was worried that there was no size for it. Currently, I'm between a 12/14 in pants. The elastic was tight, since it's not really for a larger size & was most comfortable up under the breast at the ""true"" waist, so I walked around looking dorky & like I belonged in the 50s.Came VERY wrinkled; had to steam it, as wetting & drip-drying didn't do the trick.By the end of the day, it had started to pill. I could get one more good wear out of it, though."
5,Nice!,Bought this and many accessories from Viv! for Halloween. This skirt was very nice. Full and well-made. I got alot of compliments that night! Thanks Viv!
4,A Cutie!,"This skirt is sooo precious. What acute little poodle. Thank you formaking this where it fits a varietyof sizes also.I will be ordering more products fromyou. As a matter of fact, I previouslyordered some cat eyeglasses from you.Meow...Gina Lee"
4,Excellent Preparation,"The Kaplan SAT II Chemistry book provides excellent preparation for the exam. The extensive information covered details almost everthing that you could possibly want to know for this exam. However, there are several useless pieces of information in this book. The equilibrium equations with natural logs, etc. are all extra useless stuff. Also the extra material for atomic orbitals is not on the SAT II. No one will ask you about the specific name of quantum numbers. This extra stuff means that they didn't put in enough descriptive chemistry review and experimentation, hence only 4 stars. Not perfect, but if you buy either Chemistry the Easy way or the other Barrons SAT II book and read up on the two great chapters on experiments and descriptive chemistry you're all set. I recommend buying the REA book as well for the practice. Nothing improves your score as much as practice."
4,Great Sound for the Price!!!,"Just set my system up and love it! Lots of ways to adjust the sounds on each speaker. Various sound settings make it very configurable. What I love is that I can pipe all of my stuff (DVD, CD, VHS, etc.) through here and it all sounds great.Are there better systems out there? Sure. However, you'll have to pay a lot more money. If you want an inexpensive Home Theater reciever I would definitely recommend this JVC.And one of the things I love more than anything is the remote. I can control my receiver, my JVC TV, my Sony VHS, and my Panasonic DVD/CD player ALL WITH THIS REMOTE."
3,"Looks good, if I get it...","This is just a warning -- I've read great reviews about the receiver, but you might want to know that the ""Availability: Usually ships within 24 hours"" part is a bit off. I've been waiting about 168 hours so far, and I just got notified that there's an even longer delay. If you can actually get a hold of one of these receivers, I'm sure you'll love it, but the 'getting' is the tricky part."
3,problem solved,"like most reviews, the microphone shorted out within a week of use. when the music started skipping, i simply changed the batteries and the problem was solved. my daughter still loves this toy."
4,Barney got beat up quick,I loved this toy and so did my 2 year old daughter A and 10 month old son L. It was her birthday present.But it seemed to not last that long at our house.It plays great songs and has bright colored pictures and lots of buttons. Great learning toy. Happy toy.Here are the problems:The microphone part was awesome but it stopped working soon after A recieved it. Then Barney's voice and singing just kept skipping whenever she turned it on. That as you know is NO GOOD!!!My children may be younger but not that rough to break down that quickly!I'm sad and so are they that it broke so soon. Hopefully if you purchase it it will have alot of a longer shelf life!
3,BARNEY SONGBOOK,"I found this toy to be loud, my son loves it and really enjoys bringing it along in the car and shopping. He received it as a gift. I don't neccessarily believe that I would have purchased it for 21.00 dollars, but am glad he did receive it because it's a hit for him at this stage. ( two and a half years old)"
2,DOES NOT LAST!,"My 2 year old daughter loved this toy...I say ""loved"", because it only lasted a month or so. I thought the skipping was due to the toy being dropped, but other purchasers of this toy seem to share the same problem."
2,Great toy but didn't last!,"My 18 mo. old daughter received this as a gift and absolutely loved the familiar Barney songs. This quickly became her favorite toy, but the microphone broke after a couple of uses. That wasn't a big deal since my daughter didn't really understand that concept anyway. However, the toy itself started skipping after only a few weeks, and quickly got to the point where it can't get past the initial ""hello"". Very annoying and definitely not worth the money."
3,It is pretty,"This is a very pretty drum set. However, it is cheap and came with no manual to put it together. The drum heads are very cheap and are completely beaten and scuffed up after only one light use. The cymbals are of cheap quality as well. The package came with missing pieces because one of the bags of parts came apart. If you have a little extra cash get a better quality drum set. If not this one will do. I hate that I have to be so careful of what I say on these reviews. Several of my reviews have been turned down which makes reviewing difficult if I am not allowed to say what I feel."
4,Judy in Love & Alone on cd can it get any better?,"Finally, Judy ""ALONE"" on cd plus the added bonus of ""JUDY IN LOVE"" what more could one ask ? It was so good to get this cd and reminiece about when I first heard the album. I was 13 and was always scrimping and saving to get my next record album. I joined Capital Record Club and salivated when I received the ""ALONE"" album and placed it on my record player. Gordon Jenkins mournful strains to the beautiful singing of Judy just made it such a special album and I loved listening to it on a rainy day. Not that I'm a depressed person but just the warm, secure feel of listening to a great entertainer making the most of some great songs.I hope a new generation will get turned on to a voice that made life alot pleasanter and fun to deal with. Music gives so much more meaning to our lifes and we have been so blessed to have had Judy in our world to make it alot brighter."
1,Terrible sound and terrible packaging,"Let me rant. This CD has 2 albums on it. 1 is mono and the other stereo!? I have these albums on records and they are both stereo. I feel ripped off. Also, these albums do not sound anywhere like the records in quality. In fact, they sound very boring and lacking of any sort of life. Judy did very big, exciting production numbers and the sound on this CD makes them sound stale and dead. I returned this CD and demanded my money back. The store clerk said I wasn't the only one. Thumbs way down."
1,It's Junk,"I had this toaster for under 3 years when I came home one day and it smoked and died. I have to agree that it didn't toast evenly but at least it looked cool and worked. Now, Kitchen Aid wants me to pay $52 for a pro-rated replacement (which is supposed to be Half Price)and I can buy it here for $63. I always thought people paid more for Kitchen Aid because of the reliability factor. A one year warranty on a $100 TOASTER makes no sense. I wanted something better than the $9.99 drugstore models and got a mediocre (though cool looking) toaster that lasted less than 3 years. I am VERY dissatisfied and will not buy another Kitchen Aid product."
1,Flimsy!,"The item was delivered on time and the package and contents were undisturbed. However, when we removed the item from its box we discovered the latch holding one side of toaster's outer shell to be broken and loose. There were no signs of any damage to the exterior of the product. I can only assume there's a product defect."
4,So far so good,"It seems to work as advertised so far. Its only been a week, but I have been fairly pleased with it."
4,Lazy Days,"I got this product not yet 24 hours ago, and that I have something aside from elbow grease to go into getting the dishes clean leaves me stoked. The instructions are horrible, but for anybody with a reasonable amount of mechanical knowledge and common sense should be able to hook this up without a hitch.The actual cleaning ability leaves much to be desired. Even if it had a second spray arm at the top I wouldn't think it to be of much good. So I highly recommend cleaning dishes prior to placing them in the dishwasher. Not to make the dishwasher obsolete, but enough so that there isn't anything really 'stuck' to the plate like egg yolk or something cause there doesn't appear to be a great deal of water pressure. Aside from that, it seems like a really good thing to have around."
3,haier coutertop dishwasher,"I am bsically happy with this product. I will point out, that it is very imprtant that the water connection be hooked up securely and the cold water on fairly high or all the way. This is my second dishwaher of this type and I believe i burned out hte first one by not turning on the water more than half way whenI ran the appliance. For what it is, it doe a great job, runs quietly and doesn't seem to use a whole lot of energy."
1,Do not waste your time and money,"I bought it on Nov. 27, 2006 and it was broken (water leaking at the bottom) after several months. Then I called in customer service and they replaced it with a new one. I was pleased at that time. But several weeks ago (around May, 2008), it was broken again. Since the warranty period already past, I was told by the representitive that they can do nothing with it. I think it must have design defects since the same problem occured for two new machines. But they said it just due to my bad luck. So before you buy one, think twice."
3,So-So,"I have owned this dishwasher for almost 2 years and occasionally it will fill with water, go through the cycle then drain most but not all of the water before it refills. Bottom lines is it refills before all the water is pumped out and shuts off without finishing cycle. When it works, it works well. I have this problem once or twice a month. Generally a good bang for the buck. I would buy it again if in a pinch."
1,Ugh!,"Well, my dishes are clean, but the stupid thing won't drain all the way. I've checked all the troubleshooting things, and none of them are the problem. I plan on calling customer service tomorrow, but from what I've read on here, maybe I shouldn't waste my time and should instead just enjoy my new 54 lb. paperweight. :("
3,"Arrived broken, working for now.","In a bit of a hurry, I ordered the Haier dishwasher without reading all the reviews. It arrived damaged and clearly it went into the box that way, because the box and packing materials were pristine. I called the company and they suggested I try to fix it myself, if that didn't work, then I could take it to a service center.So, after bending some metal with pliers and a bit of duct tape, I got it working.The unit does work now and quite well, but it is so flimsy that I worry it won't last long."
1,Haier is Complete Junk,I bought a Haier convection oven and it broke after only a few months. I called their customer service department and they said they would send me a new one. I have waited 2 months and made 17 phones and still nothing. DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS COMPANY. Their products are cheap chinese junk and they DO NOT stand behind their products. Don't believe me? Look around on the web and you will see plenty of other people complaining about their cheap products and ZERO customer support.
3,No real pictures of any use,This is probably a good dishwasher but everyone hides the details of how hard or cumbersome it is to hook up and use. Even the so-called user photos are staged to hide the connections and do not show what it does to the usability of your sink after installation. I don't think these photos were submitted by an actual buyer. Probably an employee of Haier. I want to buy one but won't until I find out and see the connections and their design. Is the sink even useable after install? Do you have to disconnect it everytime you want to use your sink? Is there storage provision for the drain hose when not being used or is this thing always hanging in your sink. I would like to see some legitimate clear pictures showing just how well it is designed and how the water is connected. Does it have a pass-thru connection so you can use your faucet without disconnecting it? To much vagueness and not enough worthwhile pictures.
1,Pffftt!!!,"IMHO a piece of junk, it's not user friendly, it did not come with all the proper attachments for my sink and even after getting all the proper attachments I've never been able to get mine working properly. It does nothing more than get dishes wet and as other reviewers have mentioned, if you're not careful with the drain hose it will get everything else wet instead! This is poorly built all around. Save your money and buy anything but this!"
1,Very disapointed in this product,This product worked fairly well for two times. Then it started leaking and also did not clean. I will not buy anything from the internet again.
5,Rave review for space saver,When I saw this small dishwasher I thought it was a wonderful idea. I have a very small kitchen and think this would be a wonderful idea!! Kudos to the inventor.
4,A few things to know,"The pros are that it really gets your dishes clean and you can really get a lot of dishes in there. The cons are that the heat dry feature really is worthless, as stated in other reviews.I like it, it does a good job. It seems like it will last a long time. You do not need hot water, the heating element gets the water hot fast, just like a coffee maker. The quick release is handy. The huge drawback is that for such a large company, I have no idea why the instruction manual is so pathetic. You basically have to guess your way through it.On the heat dry, just open up the door and let them air dry. They are so hot at that point that they dry pretty quick. Overall, I am happy with this purchase. I hate washing dishes in the sink."
4,Great for people who hate doing the dishes,"I have been using this dishwasher for a few weeks and it's great. I didn't have any problem setting it up, except finding all of the pieces of tape inside. There isn't a real soap dispenser, just a notch in the door and it slides to the bottom when you close it, weird but still works.Only problem I have had so far is that the machine tripped the circuit breakers the first time I used it. I share electricity with another apartment and I can't use the blowdryer with the tv on:) If you have a similar set up, keep in mind you'll probably have to turn everything else off for 45 min while this is working. (I turn mine on just before bed, problem solved)I love this thing and my sink has been empty ever since, except the occasional pot and pan that is too big for the machine.Pros: works great, fit's in the tiny kitchen in my apartment. easy to use, even without reading the manual.Cons: Uses a lot of electricity, big bowls and plates hard to fit inside."
4,How to turn vent dry on and off,"You push the button for the wash cycle twice to turn the vent dry on and off. If anyone was wondering where that rinse aid dispenser was, it is the same as the detergent dispenser."
1,Stopped working after 4 days,"We bought the Haier dishwasher for a small apartment after I was diagnosed with cancer. Unfortunately it broke down after only 4 days. The customer service dep't at Haier wasn't really helpful (they could only give me the name of a place where I could get it repaired) so I returned it to Amazon. I was very disappointed -- what kind of machine breaks down after only four days? I ordered a Danby from compactappliance.com as a replacement and it's still going. My advice: don't buy the Haier, it's a headache."
3,disapointed,"I got my dishwasher yesterday. At first I was so excited but then I nticed a dent on the top. I set it up to use anyway becasue the dent was small. Unfortunately I was not impressed by the machine, my friend has a danby which is much nicer and sturdier. When I turned the machine on it made a terrible noise but then proceeded to wash fine. The machine will not drain. I had it right next to the sink and a foot above the drain. The warning beep kept going all throught the wash cycle no matter what I did. I am returning mine(which Amazon makes very easy) and ordering a Danby. This machine has a plastic interior and the Danby is stainless steel. If the machine worked the way it was supposed to zI would give it a 3 but I would ahve to rate the Danby a 5."
1,Failed after 2 month,"I want to suggest any potential buyer to stay away from this washer. It is a crap. I agree that it washes very well, but the drying capability is handicapped(does not dry the plates completely) and the worst part! It failed to work after only 2 month of normal usages. One day it just stopped working, and I am trying to contact the customer support right now, and it appears that the people answering the phone is in India and I have to wait for someone else to call me back in US. Not sure how long it will take.... Wish me good luck! and for thouse of you who has not yet purchased this washer, STAY AWAY!"
5,Great little workhorse,"Well, I've had this thing set up for about a month now, and no problems whatsoever....well, except that I missed the tape holding the lower spray arm still so it didn't do such a great job the first time......The only things I can recommend is be sure to get all the tape off of the parts in the inside, and realize sooner than I did that the plastic ring on the hose slides down for ease of attachment to your sink.....All in all, it's been really great. Doesn't hold a lot at one time, but it's a very convenient appliance and it does a great job (so far)."
4,"Haier HDT18PA, works good","I just received my Haier HDT18PA dishwasher and washed my first load of dishes. The dishwasher worked great and did a very good job. There are some differences between what is advertised and what you get. They say there is a rinse aid dispenser which I do not see on the machine. They also say you can choose vent drying but you have no choice on that. Overall, it does the job just fine if you are short on space."
1,Leaks after less than a year,"I bought one of these machines about 10 months ago. Until it started leaking a few days ago, I loved it. I now know (too late) that a year or less seems to be the norm for a compact dishwasher. What happened to the days when an appliance lasted 20 or 30 years?"
2,Stopped working but Etronics helped get me service,"The Haier product stopped working after 1 week. I could turn it on but it would shut itself off in a few minutes. I called the company twice but their systems were down. They were supposed to call me back but they did not.However, Etronics, the shipper was very helpful. I talked to one of their representatives who contacted Haier and set up a replacement process for me.I hope the replacement product works better."
1,great but short,Great dishwasher for this price and this size.Worked perfect for one year... and broke!
2,only read review's from those has owned more than a year,"I had 2 Haier poartable dishwashers. One broken down 8 month and the other worked about a year. Then no matter what button you push, no action at all. The cost of repair is more than you buy one.Plus, the customer service from Haier is terrible.I am buying other brand after 2 years trying Haier."
1,Does not work,"We bought this product from the manufacturer's web-site, on December 11, 2009. It took almost three months to get to us.Received the product on March 11, 2010. Came with a ""quick fit"" unit that goes on the fauct, no problem, but the unit is shape like a hexagone and the hose is round. So it leaks everywhere and DOES NOT WASH DISHES!!! I've ran it three time, not a single clean dish!Calling customer service is a joke as they do not answer, you have to leave a voice mail and hope the respond soon.Piece of junk and worthless company!!"
1,waste of time and money,"I waited to buy this product because I was really not sure if I had the space for even a portable one. I wish I would have never bought it. I had owned it for less then a month when the 1st problem appeared, then another, then another. Calling customer service is a joke and if your lucky they will call you with 2 weeks. The rinse aid never worked right my dishes were always cloudy. The water pump went out, Then it statred flooding my kitchen. Then water created a huge mess. I called Customer service on fixing this new problem took 16 days to get back to me. They also will not pay for damage incurred by there faulty equipment if any one wants that. Its a very expensive piece of junk. Do not buy. Save your money."
1,Caught On Fire,"I bought this dishwasher for my son.He had it one year and last week it literally ""blew up!"" Sparks flew out the door and back of the machine.Luckily,he was home at the time.Scary part is...he usually turned it on before he went to bed.Customer service at Haier has been a nightmare.Beware of this product and this company."
2,Fine for the Keebler Elves,It will not hold more than two full-sized dinner plates. Forget pots and pans...No way are they going inside. I excpect better from Haier. They normally make good quality products.
1,Broke after two weeks and TERRIBLE customer service,"We bought this dishwasher online and got it three weeks later. It never did work right, and after the fourth use, it broke. Started to fill with water, then just beeped and shut off. We called Haier (HA! what a joke) and went through all of the things to try to get it to work again. Then were told we would have to pay $14.99 if we wanted a new one and it would take over three weeks. No thank you. I'd rather wash them by hand!Don't waste your money, time or sanity on this product."
1,A dishwasher for one-time use,"Our first Haier dishwasher broke down in one month after purchase. After calling them dozens of times, we finally got it replaced. But yesterday, after lightly using for barely a month, the second dishwasher broke down again. I have no energy to call them again and again. We decide to throw it away and get another one from different brand. So, our experience is: if you want a dishwasher for one-time use only, like plastic cups, this is your perfect choice."
3,works,"well it works, doesnt get dishes quite as clean as a full size name brand dishwasher, but it does sufficiently clean dishes. the single biggest problem i have had with the dish washer is there is a cover that comes down about 2-3 inches from the top opening that seems to serve no purpose what so ever besides not allowing full size dishes to go in the machine. i solved this problem by cutting it off."
2,A wee bit better than handwashing,"I live in a small place, and I HATE doing dishes... especially silverware. When I saw this I had to have it.What they don't tell you, and what caused me to return it, is that the drain is ""gravity"" which means it needs to be at least sink high.Well, that didn't work for me because it wouldn't fit under my cabinets, and good luck trying to find a rolling cart that is counter high.I did 2 loads, neither of which I was impressed with. My dishes were not clean. However, I wouldn't write it off so easily since I didn't play around with soap amounts. Also, there is nowhere to put drying agents.I can say it was difficult to load... hardly anything fits like it seems it should.Thus, I give this a ""little better than nothing"" rating, but I took mine back and got an 18"" Kenmore."
2,waiting for a warranty replacement,The unit was defective right out of the box. It cost me 14.99 to have a new unit shipped to me. You would think that shipping would be covered. Buyer beware
4,It works,It works about as well as any other dishwasher. I have large plates that do not fit in well. It arrived at my apt. with a large dent on the side from shipping. The door does not close perfectly. Easy set up.It works. Not amazing but not bad.
1,DO NOT BUY - Terrible product,"This dishwasher is terrible - I've gone through 4 in less than a year, and it's broken again. Good when it works, but I've incurred lots of water damage, etc on this. Bad service, bad product."
3,not what i expected,"it's ok for an old lady or a college kid, not practical for a real kitchen. works as stated, can't fault the seller. just not what i thought it would be."
2,Haier HDT18PA Dishwasher,"Since there are very few dishwashers available in this size and none of them have very good reviews, I continue to buy the Haier dishwasher. When the machine works, it does a great job of cleaning the dishes. However, getting one that works is a problem. I have bought several of these machines. About one in three will continue to work after the first week. There doesn't seem to be much quality control at the factory. I don't bother with the warrenty. The machine is cheap. So, it is cost effective to just buy two or three of them and use the non-working ones for parts. Once you get the sloppy assembly problems fixed, the machine will last a good while. Haier does not repair these machines under warrenty. They just replace them and all you get is another machine that won't work. You have to be willing to do the repairs yourself if you want one that will work and last. Also, they advertise these as two level washing. They are not! But, they do a good job on the dishes."
2,Arrived Damaged,"Arrived seriously damaged; returned it and got my money back. Box looked fine, so who knows whose fault it was....just a hassle for this guy."
1,Machine did not work/Service was Terrible,"I bought this machine, and it did not work. I called their customer service department. They were less than helpful in trying to resolve the problem. I would never recommend the product. I think their service department was the worst I have dealt with."
3,2 in 2 years 3 monthes,"I like this machine when it works. It does everything you may want from normail size machine except its life span. I purchased my 1st one in Aug 2005, and it leakes in Aug 2006, 20 days before the warranty expired. I called Haier, and it sent me a new one and took back the broken one. In Sept. this year, it rejected water with continous beepping. I do not know what it is the problem. After i read some reviews here, it sounds like there is some clog inside. Before I throw it away, I kick it heavly on the back. It works again, but it required me to kick it at least once every week. Now, Nov 8th, the upper fan collapsed. I take the fan out, and throw it. Still, I do not give up, and put the water and force it work. The dishes were cleaned.According to my limited experince of two, its life span is about 1 year to 1.5 year.(I used it everyday.). If the price is $200, it is about $0.5/day. Buy accordingly."
3,"Cleans dishes well, but poorly designed.","My dishes are nice and clean--no issues there. Haier's design, though, leaves something to be desired: The layout of the dish tray is awkward and inefficient, and as other reviewers have mentioned, the wastewater hose should have been attached to the intake hose. My suggestion: buy the Danby instead."
1,do not buy this item,"I purchased this item in much anticipation of not having to hand wash my dishes anymore. When it arrived it was a bit larger than I expected but was willing to sacrifice the counter space for it. The first cycle it worked Beautifully! The second cycle it broke! I had read the reviews that it has a tendency to do this, but I just thought those reviewers were chance happenings. I was VERY disappointed even to find out that the only place to do repairs in the Chicago area was the suburbs, and that they will not come to you, you have to go to them. Anyway, to sum up, don't waste your time or money on this item."
3,Read all review before you buy,"I have some concerns with this product. We have had ours for less than 3 years and it has already broken down. We have an old house built in the 40's, so very limited space to install a dishwasher. The dishwasher should have lasted more than 3 years, but I am buying another one, the same model, only because of the price, and the area that I have devoted to the dishwasher will only fit this model. I figured that trying to have it repaired may cost me as much as a new one, and would still be stuck with 3 years old parts that could fail at any time. If you notice the other review has owned their dishwasher of less than 3 years. I hope that this new one will hold up longer than the first one. I would read the other review and then make an intelligent choice it this is the dishwasher you want to buy."
1,totally disappointing!,We got the dishwasher to wash my new born baby's fomula bottles. It worked fine in the first month and then broke down suddenly. We called them several times in a month and finally get a call back. We were told the part broken was not in warranty. The guy calling us refused to tell us where he is calling from and what the number is. I tried to call warranty department again and no answer since then.We will never buy a Haier product again!
1,Not worth it,"I received the washer right on time, no problems with shipping. It was fairly simple to set up, very straight forward. The problem began when I actually used the washer. It made bizarre sounds throughout the wash cycle, and was very loud. I looked in the manual and it said that the noises were normal. I ran the washer just about every day. After less than a month, the pump quit working. It would get through most of the cycle and then it would stop with all the lights flashing and just beep until it was turned off. When I opened the door, all the water was still in the bottom of the tub. All I can assume is that the pump failed. I drained the washer manually, and tried again with the exact same results. I am extremely disappointed with this product."
5,Andalite Chronicles Books 1 and 2,"These were two very awesome books. I got them yesterday and read them both in the same day. I could not put them down! I can't wait until Death of an Alien comes out, but it might be sad judging from the title."
5,I thought that it was a very good book,I liked this book a lot because now you know what happend befofe the Animorphs. I thought it was dumb when the Ellimist said that he could not interfere but set things straight. Why did they build the time matrix when all is does is cause a problem for all the races in the galaxy?
4,this book is intriguing but complicated,Animorphs fans search no more for the whole story.The Andalite Chronicles is the only chance to find out what happened before the Animorphs.You'll find out the secret of Tobias and read an ending that will surprise you beyond belief
5,The best ever,This book is one of....no...THE best book I've ever read. It made me cry and made me laugh. It's a very well-writen book.
5,THE BEST!!!,"This is the best book ever written. The best book in the whole entire Animorphs series!! This book ROCKED!!!!! The ending is the coolest!!! Can't wait for The Taxxon Chronicles, The Visser Chronicles and The Hork-Bajir Chronicles!!"
5,I love it!,"I have the whole series of Animorphs, and these 3 books are some of the best of all Animorphs books."
5,This is a great book!,"I have read all three Andalite Chronicles and have to say that they are GREAT!!! Elfangor's Journey is good, Alloran's Choice is even better, and An Alien Dies is spectacular! If you haven't read them, let me tell you that in An Alien Dies there is a little surprise in store for you. I won't spoil the surprise, but read the books!!!!!!"
5,No words can describe the sheer excellence,"This is simply one of THE best best books I have ever read.For the most part,it would be a serious,almost tragic story if it wouldn't have been for KA original humor.Of all the books I have ever read,this is truly one of my favorites."
5,It took me some time to read it.,"It is the best book i'v ever read, you havt to read this book if you are to read the Animorphs. It is also a long book, but I would have read it in a day if it wasn't for the fact that I was also playing Riven with my sister. But any ways it is the best book ever. Read it and like it or else I will come and get you, or I'll send my Andalite's after you!!!!!"
3,"This book is neat, but it's really confusing.","This book is pretty neat, but it's so confusing Eglofor uses a thingy called the time matrex and they make fake universis but don't get me wrong. It's a good book"
1,terrible,i only bought this item for the map it comes with. that was a mistake the map was too tightly glued to the page and when trying to remove it the map tore so i promptly ripped it and burned the pieces.
3,not bad but not great...,"the map was pretty good, but i would've liked it better if it also included the locations of the places mentioned in the newer books. also, as someone who read all the redwall books, i think the questions were kind of easy. the riddles are also the same riddles that were in the books, so if you read all the books, this might be kind of boring for you."
3,SMALLER THAN I EXPECTED,"Unfortunately, I did not pay enough attention to measurements when I ordered this & I find it fairly small, albeit quite portable. Will do for the diaper bag when out & about, I guess, but won't be used other than that."
4,Good to put on top of changing pad,"I use this on top of my regular changing pad and it works great - just spray it down whenever it gets dirty and I don't have to wash the fabric changing pad cover so often. It would be a bit small to take for changing a baby on the go, though. Mabye put a burp cloth under his head and use this under the diaper."
5,Decent changing pad,"I was on the look out for a changing pad to have around the house. I don't always want to go upstairs to the changing station. This is a decent sized changing pad. Nothing exciting, but it does the job and has velcro on it to help it close up after."
5,Perfect changing pad when your away from home!,"Small, compact, and folds up. Very convenient and easy to store in your diaper bag. I highly recommend!"
5,Good stuff!!!,I like the conveinence of the gift registry and it arrived safely and promptly and my friend loves it!!Thankyou!!M B-V.(PS-I am speaking about the Kiddopotomus Quickchange Changing Pad-Portable)
5,Great product,This will be great for the grandbaby when he visits.Kiddopotamus & Co Quickchange Portable Changing Pad Waterproof And Padded For Changes On The Go
3,Well created score,"I mainly bought the CD for the main title. I found that all the tracks were very similar, but that's just my opinion. The score really does put across the comedy side as well as the drama of the film."
3,stroller,the wheel fell off when shopping-we are kinda tough on stuff but this was ok for the money-the sender was good though and would buy from them again
1,Never buy This !!!,We bought this -- and boy what a waste of a few hundred dollors !! The back axcl broke at Disneyland !!!
2,"Nice looking, but I DON'T LIKE IT!!!","I love the look of this stroller, but it is bulky, heavy and hard to fold and unfold, because of this I don't like using it. I've used it about 3 times in the last 7 months. The front seat does not recline very much, not good enough for a new born and if the child in the back seat kicks the front it will move the seat, it does not lock good into place. So, besides these things its an ok stroller. oh and when I recieved the stroller one of the front wheels was broken, called for replacement, friendly customer service but I had to fax them my recipt but they sent me 2 wheels, so no complaints will the service.I have recently bought the graco duorider, hopefully it will be before Halloween, cause I'm not looking forward to using this stroller.I wish I had never bought this. A waste of 160 bucks."
2,Not very pleased,"I bought this stroller 1 year ago this week. If I had to do it all over again I would not have purchased this stroller. Two sets of wheels have broken within the first 4 months of use: a [...] and newborn. Now 1 year later the back seat is broken in so much that it sags and does not make for a comfortable ride for the backseater. I agree with a previous post about the front rider being able to lock the wheels, HUGE PAIN! Needed to be designed better.For the price, not worth it."
1,Wheels fall off,"I also have had repeat problems with the back wheels falling off - while my infant is in the stroller. I spoke with a friend of mine who also had this problem with an Evenflo stroller.I purchased this because it was fairly light and folded up small, but there is no point to have those features if the wheels do not work. Don't buy this product."
5,I enjoy this stroller!,"Unlike several of the other reviewers, I really like this stroller! (We even have the matching infant carrier.) I have a 3yr old (weighs 29 lbs) and a 2 1/2 mo. old (weighs 12.9 lbs) and I use this stroller alot. Granted the wheels started to make a tiny noise but it was after getting the wheels wet and WD40 cleared the problem up fast. It's the MOST compact double stroller out there currently. It's comfortable material and very roomy for both children. The adult cup holder is roomy and sturdy. Plenty of pockets & storage too!I'm shocked to see all these wheels falling off!! Since I put this stroller together it makes me wonder if all these wheels weren't put on correct because it was a little complicated part of the instructions.Also, I put my 3yr old in the front or back and either way it still turns and moves good expecially compared to other double strollers I steered and moved around. I hunted for 6months for a double stroller and this is by far the best one!"
4,"Great stroller, but some problems","I got this stroller shortly after my second son was born. My oldest was 1 1/2 and I counld not even go out of the house if it was not for this doulble stroller. I to did have some problems with the back wheels, and I called the company and in a few days recieved new back wheels. Since then I have had zero problems. The step for the child in the back is a great addition to the stroller. My son loves to be able to get into the stroller by himself. I have had this stroller for over a year and had only the one problem. I would recommend this stroller to anyone.As an update, bought the stroller 4 and a half years ago and am still using it with my new son who is 3 months and out 9 month old foster baby. Such a great buy. Almost 5 years of use. Had to replace the tray, but that was because of me throwing it into the back of my van. oops. Easy to replace and did not cost much."
5,A Treasure,"I love this CD -- it hasn't left my CD wallet since I purchased it three months ago. You feel like you're in the same room while he's playing. Favorite cuts are ""It's Comin' Down This Way,"" ""Back Roads and Rainy Days,"" and ""Lightning Strikes Twice,"" but every song is a winner. Believe me, once you give this one a listen, you'll be hunting high and low for the rest of his catalogue."
4,everything is alright! LALA *sings loudly*,"oh. my. goodness.this whole album is the cutest thing i ever heard. generally im more into a lot of older stuff... and more classic style rock... but although this is kinda punk/pop i really like it =) its the kind of music that makes you wanna dance around and sing into a hairbrush. if you sometimes feel like being a sped and you need some music to get you into the whole feel of retardedness then this is your album.... especially everything is alright, when you're around, make out kids and better open the door. totally awesome =) buy it!... make out kids never had a chance to be best friends.... =D"
5,Fond of Twin Peaks afternoons and expensive wine with cordo,"I got the new Motion City Soundtrack cd yesterday and just can't put it down. Its one of those albums that just makes you celebrate everything good about being and forget about your worries. Justin's voice is so unqiue and calming. Constructed through thoughtful, witty lyrics the album is an amazing cake of punk, rock and pop with pieces of everything else throw in for texture. Tracks like ""Together We'll Ring in the New Year"" and ""Let's Get F'd Up and Die"" manifest their originality. Though literally any song could be on a top 40 radio station, I don't think they have to promotion to break through to the mainstream. Regardless this cd grabs hold of you and reminds you exactly why you love music and life!"
1,Pop Punk=Vomit,"Pop punk ties with nu metal(rap metal), 80's hair metal, disco and emo as the worst and most offensive music concievedHow sh*theads like this band can just casually get together in a studio and ""write songs"" with horrible teenybopper choruses and stupid hooks and treat themselves as if they were actual musicians and artists who make art is beyond meFind real punk. Listen to Black Flag, Bad Brains, Rites of Spring, Embrace, Minor Threat and Fugazi. Music that has soul and honesty and has no interest in being ""pop"""
1,THIS IS THE KIND OF MUSIC THAT RUINED REAL ROCK N ROLL,"You guys have no idea what your listening to. This music is horrible. The guys playing it have no skill. It ruined American Rock N Roll and its because of you dumbasses who buy this music that we're never going to have another Rolling Stone or Beatle styled band. Thanks, This music is garbage Dont buy or support it"
1,love the music hate the quality,"I got the music because I like it this band is one of may favorites, but i was disappointing when i downloaded and played the songs they skipped like a broken record."
5,=),"All I have to say is that I heart Motion City Soundtrack. I saw them when they came to Tallahassee and they put on a great show. Commit This to Memory shows that the band has evolved, but hasn't strayed from their unique sound. They've mellowed out a tad, but still uphold their melodic, catchy tunes, and of course awesome vocals by Justin. This album is great, defintely worth the Moo-lah."
5,Please.,"How can you discredit an album such as this? Tell me...every other person that gave this album one star has their stupid brain on one thing ""omg...you like no nothing about TRUE music...do yourself a favor and listen to real XXXCOREXXX like Hawthorne Heights etc."" Please....you are pathetic. First of all, you only like this sort of music cuz you and your stupid friends go at night cut yourselves and other stupid useless thing. Can you not appreciate DECENT music. Learn to appreciate the fact that they work their a.. off to make a good album so unappreciative jerks like you have some purpose?ITS A GOOOD ALBUMBUY IT.Its worth everyhting."
3,what happened to the conviction?,"talk about sophomore slump. i was seriously biting my nails waiting for this album to come out. 'i am the movie' rocked, definitely making the band worthy of all the buzz they got, but this is just another teenie bopper record you can add to the pile. where'd the originality go? i think i heard the same song on this cd like 4 times. hopefully their heads don't get any bigger and they get an experienced producer (no offense to mark cuz he rocks but c'mon). motion city'll be back and hopefully rocking arenas full of angry teens instead of smiling girls."
5,Great album by a great band!,Mr. Big's first album. An excellant 1980's band with excellant songs. This album brings back memories of back in the day!
4,"All That Talent, and What do you Get!?","This alumb itself is alright but after hearing bassist Billy Sheenan with David Lee Roth and Guitarist Paul Gilbert with Racer X, the output on this album was well....not exciting. Sheehan and Gilbert should have just let loose with the ripping solos but they just sold out. All that talent and you get pop music. And if you listen to their other stuff after this album, you know they sold out. The band is not as ripping as I hoped it would be but I like Billy Sheehan and that is why this album gets four stars."
2,Fly Pen Multiplacation and Division,"The problem with this product is that it does not come with any way to hook it up to the Fly Pen--no instructions, it there some other piece of hardware I need to buy etc. Not happy because it's been sitting in my sons room for over 6 months."
1,Garbage,"This was a gift, and I didn't look at reviews before it was purchased. All the bad scores are right. The color keeps flashing on and off regardless of what kind of tape is being played. The display shows the channel whenever it is turned on, which is quite irritating when you have it hooked to a cable box. You see the ""3"" on one screen and the cable box channel on its screen. Give me back my old RCA!"
1,Worst VCR Ever!!!,"1. To record you have to hit play and record like the very old VCRs. It didn't explain this in great detail in the user manual.2. Finding out to setup AUX was also a pain.3. Programming the VCR to record a show is ridiculously hard. Instead of selecting start time and entering in the numbers on the remote you basically have to scroll to the correct time. Also after I succesfully completed the programing I didn't realize I had to hit the timer option and my show did not record. Come on JVC, most VCRs you just finish the programing and then once you close the menu the timer is automatically on.Conclusion: After two days of owning this product I returned it to my place of purchase. It felt like I was in a time warp and this was a VCR from the 80s. I was just suprised it wasn't a Betamax!"
1,Last JVC I'll own,"The unit picks up interference from my treadmill during tape playback and transmits it to the TV. The current JVC that I am trying to replace does not do this. JVC sent a replacement that does the same thing. Now I can't return the unit. JVC customer service says it isn't a defect and will only replace it again. Who wants another unit if it does the same thing? The auto function didn't work correctly - I finally had to manually program the channels. There is no backup battery system like on my current unit. If the power flickers, you have to reprogram everything. The display only show time and channel - you don't know where you are on the tape without pressing the display button and the display goes off after a few seconds. I used to be a loyal JVC customer but if this is the quality of JVC now, I'm finding a new manufacturer."
4,Good buy & quality.,"This is the second JVC VCR I have purchased in the last two years. I am extremely satisfied with the picture quality on playback for this particular model, even in EP mode. The only reaon I gave four stars instead of five is because there is some background noise that can be distracting. If you use the simple tracking method though, I found it could be corrrected in most cases. I have two DVD players which of course are wonderful, but I still have those VHS tapes & of course I like to be able to record programs. I can't quite afford a DVD recorder yet & if you can't either, for the price, I think this VCR is a good bargain--easy setup, remote easy to use, programmed recording easy to learn. It's a good deal. Whatever you do, stay away from Panasonic VCR's. They were great years ago but definitely not the same quality they once were. I had to return one after one week because it ate a brand new tape. Good Luck & happy shopping."
1,JVC should recall this VCR,"This is the absolute worst VCR that I have ever had. Extremely hard to program, no memory during a power outage and it didn't even last through 7 months of use. I thought it was the tapes at first. The picture and sound suddenly started going in and out, and I wound up watching a blue screen most of the time. The warranty may cover parts, but the labor is what costs. I can buy a brand new VCR for $40.00. Quite frankly, I will never buy another JVC product again and will encourage others not to either, unless they recall this VCR, fix the problems or refund everyone's money or give them a replacement VCR of better quality."
5,Saturday Morning Cartoon Junkie turned Dirty Old Man,"The animation is first rate in my opinion. Glad they didn't wait long to put this on DVD. Originally recorded this off of cable, but this is much better."
3,Wanted More but Worthy of Purchasing Season 2,"I definitely wanted more from this well reviewed adult animated comedy. The characters are well drawn up and worthy of superb ratings (especially 6). But quite often I felt as if the depth of dialogue was like watching a children's cartoon with the occassional adult dialogue thrown in just to remind one that it was for adults. This had the potential to be outstanding but fails short with the script writing and any depth of plot. Humor is average at best but with a little more challenge in writing could have been a knock-out adult animated show. In saying this, I often found myself returning to watch it and I just made purchase of season 2. Worthy of total price but could have been so much more. 3 1/2 stars here."
1,This DVD is for fans only.,"I like animation, I like science fiction, and I like to laugh. I don't like Tripping the Rift.It's not very funny, original, or well written. You may see some ""unique"" plots (the first episode gave me a bit of hope) but you've seen almost all of these jokes before, and they were much funnier the first time. Imagine a lame children's show, altered at the last minute to include bad language and cleavage.Speaking of cleavage, don't let the ""adult oriented"" label fool you. It's relatively tame. This show is on the SciFi network, not HBO. The same applies to ""edgy"" storylines - the only thing that's funny is how weak and watered-down they are.The animation is competent, at best. Everything is minimal, simplified, and looks like plastic. Ships, backgrounds, etc. are designed in the most lazy and unoriginal way possible.This DVD is for FANS ONLY. If you already like the show, enjoy. If it's new to you, rent it first. Please."
3,"Good Show, Dumb Episode",I like this show because it breaks rules. This episode it lame. It was free at the time though so I have no complaints.I'd take it for free again... I would not buy it though.
5,The BEST adult animated series ever!!!,"This series is absolutely BRILLIANT! Funny as hell, ""sexually spicey"" and executed in a 3D format that's great. My only complaint is that there's only one season available on DVD, this due to the second season just getting started. This is a series I hope runs as long as Futurama, Simpsons or Ren & Stimpy. If you don't like this wonderful show, then I would expect you to be either a drain-bamaged cretin or a humorless religious zealot with yer head up yer ass!"
4,Living With Green Power,This is a great book! I am a beginner at juicing. The ingredient explanations are wonderful. I especially like the Fat-Melt down recipe. My kids like any of the dessert recipes. I
2,A Good Resource Unless You Have Gluten Allergies,"I bought this book after purchasing my Green Star Juicer. I thought it would give more juice recipes than it did. Also, I have a gluten allergy/intolerance and this book has several recipes using wheat, barley and rye. The whole point of my buying a juicer and a book to go with it was to have lots of healing juice recipes and other healthy foods. Instead, I bought a book that has so many foods that make me sick I can't even use it. The only way I'd recommend this book is if the buyer didn't have any allergies or food sensitivities."
3,"Useful book, smelled very bad of stale smoke","Although the book is quite good, I bought this used. It arrived quickly but it smells so badly of cigarette smoke that I could not stand to read it inside the house. I left it outside for a couple of days. This did not help. Then I sprayed it with a natural scent which did not do much either. So, I am left with using it in a ventilated place or outside. I cannot stress how bad this book smells. Had I known this I would not have purchased this book used. I have purchased many used books and this is the first time I encountered this. The book looked new upon arrival but smelled badly."
3,Good Vendor Service... Product no functional,"The Seller gives me a good service, but the memory doesnt function. Seller returns a cost and shipping of the product."
1,Incredibly bad acting,"Is everybody reviewing the same movie? I've never seen such bad acting. And why did it get an ""R"" rating? There isn't any nudity, and the ""violence"" is a ""PG"" by all standards."
5,A Great First Effort,"Brennen Leigh's first CD leaves me wanting for an immediate second release. The blue grass/country sounds emanate from the past to enhance her own songs. The original tunes such as ""Jesse James"", No Way, Jose"" and ""The Legend of Benny Ambrose"" are solid compositions and blend well with the standards. Her voice is powerful but soft when it requires. Produced by her guitarist brother, I anxiously await a follow-up."
2,Iron Heel bogged down by its own weight,"Jack London's efforts at social novels, such as ""Iron Heel"" and ""Martin Eden"" were failures, because they are very cardboard and unconvincing. Jack London, the master story teller of the juvenile boys adventure novels, had a social conscience, but was not very good with expressing the social issues of the day, issues which usually belong in manifestos, not in literature. Jack London was no Dostoievsky, a true literary giant."
4,Everhard or London: which was the rapid socialist here?,"I did enjoy the book myself though it dragged in many parts and in some parts confusing, especially in the chapter known as ""Mechanics of a Dream"" which was a troulbing chapter. The book was a rapid apporach on socialism and the evantually downfall of captialism which i agree with, with captailsim being the downfall of everything.I would recommend this book to many people who have any views or intrest on communist or socialist history and plus its a great novel."
4,"Politically dusty, but still interesting","Who would have thunk it? Jack London, author of ""Call of the Wild,"" wrote a fantasy novel about a socialist revolution in America at the turn of the century. The tired socialist diatribes that form the bulk of this novel are laughable today, but still it's an interesting story. Perhaps even more interesting is that fact that this book, which glorifies socialism, may have been the inspiration for a book that glorifies facism: ""The Turner Diaries."" And that book, of course, is believed by some to have been the ""blueprint"" for the Oklahoma City bombing. Fortunately, London's fantasy didn't come true in America, but it did in Russia... and millions of lives were lost as a result."
3,"Good read, but - Only buy if you must",THis text is available online for free. Only purchase if you must have a hard copy (paperback).
4,Visionary,"This text is an interesting adventure for Jack London into futurism. Probably his only complete attempt at Science Fiction. He depicts the rise and struggles of Socialism against the Oligarchy in an eerily premonitory way. While this tale predates the Soviet and Chinese actions of the past century, it seems to not only predict them, it actually helps to explain them. I'm told that Jack, who was an avid Socialist for most of his life, actually resigned from the Party not long after finishing this work. In a way, he struggles to answer his own questions about the future of social systems here. After this work, he turns back to tales of adventure and finishes his days sailing the South Pacific."
1,This Edition is Missing a Crucial Chapter!,"This edition is incomplete. The editors chose to cut out London's all-important Foreward, which sets the ""novel"" up as an incomplete manuscript discovered centuries after its writing. Buy the Lawrence Hill version, which has a biting introduction by a contemporary critic of the US and its antidemocratic secret police forces."
3,About the blue light,"FYI - Three stars because I still haven't decided to buy it or something else yet. Anyway, as to the annoying blue light on the tray, some electrical tape and some attentive trimming with a razor blade should fix that problem. It's worked for me on numerous appliances/devices with LED's or other illumination you could land jets by in the fog. Well at least that how it seems when getting up in the middle of the night. So, should remedy the blue tray issue."
5,"It's REALLY slim, yet feature packed","I can't get over how thin this player is. It replaced my dependable 1988 JVC CD player and is 1/3 the height. I'm pleased that JVC still supports ""Compu-Link"" which allows this player to interact with the rest of my JVC stereo system.As for the features, I love the feature that lets you stop the DVD movie and pop it back in later to automatically continue where you left off. The Zoom feature let's you remove the letterbox bands. It's easy to configure the settings and the blue glow is cool.My first real stereo rack system was JVC in 1988 and it still works perfectly. This DVD player is great and I hope it lasts just as long. I think JVC makes quality products."
3,Stutter ruins the bargain,"I was enjoying the unit, but didn't really notice the annoying stutter during panning until I'd gotten rid of the box. Drat. Now I'll see if JVC has fixed the problem and is willing to swap it out."
2,Plays everything but stutters sometimes,I bought this player because I was so satisfied with other JVC products (like my TV). The unit has played all the DVDs I threw at it and without any hesitation loading (my old player had a lot of trouble loading). But then I noticed that during pans and fast action that it appeared as though the image was stuttering... If I stop the player and press play again right away the stuttering goes away for 30 to 90 seconds before it comes back- very ugly 8-(. I don't care about features when the play quality is this bad.
1,Leaves bad taste in mouth for JVC products.,"Bought this DVD player in May and was very happy with it until about 1 mo after it when it stopped playing CD's and VCD's. It still plays DVD's, however. It's features are great and it's look is nice too. When writing to JVC, received bad customer service. Will never buy JVC products again. Also, I encourage all of you to look hard and buy from a place like Circuit City and Best Buy with ESP plan to protect item."
2,The stutter is real,"The picture quality on this inexpensive player is very nice, no doubt about it. But the horizontal stutter is real and it's intolerable. I returned mine. I guess sometimes saving a couple bucks isn't worth it."
2,Heed Jeb6Kids advice!,"I am experiencing the excact same 'stuttering' sproblem as Jeb6Kids below. I do the excact same drill, and it comes back unless I turn the player off completely. The picture (through component-to-HDTV) is quite nice, as is the sound, but this stuttering is intolerable. I'm returning it tomorrow and might give the Panasonic 55 a try."
2,Power Supply Busted - Needs service after 4 months!,"I thought I had a good value from a reputable brand, but all of a sudden the dvd player just shuts down. I need to unplug and re-plug it to get it to start up again, only to have it shut down again. I contacted JVC and will see what kind of response I get to extending the Labor warranty past 90-days? Would hate to pay $50 to fix this thing. This kind of problem should not happen on new electronics, especially from reputable established companies."
3,Disappointed,"I had been looking for an ASV for a long time. I kept hearing how good the translation is. And I particularly wanted a version which uses God's name, rather than LORD, without going to a modernistic version, such as the Jerusalem Bible, or the JW version. It uses Jehovah, which is an anglicization, but that was fine by me. However, the archaic English is as bad as the KJV. And this is a facsimile edition, so the type is very small, and interspersed with pronunciation marks and footnotes. Very difficult to read. The maps are in black and white, and it is hard to distinguish areas by the shades of gray. I wish that there were a combination of this version with the ESV, the completely revised ASV. The ESV with ""Jehovah"" would be my ideal, though just a modern printing of this version would be a major improvement. One advantage of this edition is that it incorporates a small bible dictionary in the back, between Revelation and the concordance."
5,This book is a must-have for Arizona visitors AND residents.,"I like The Arizona Guide because it is different from other guidebooks that attempt to cover every single hotel and restaurant. The subject matter is current and informative. Even my husband, who has lived in Arizona his whole life, told me he was surprised at how much he learned about the state from the first three pages. Filled with both well-known and unusual destinations, written in easy-to-understand prose and organized into eight geographic regions, The Arizona Guide is the perfect reference book for Arizona visitors and residents alike."
2,This book is lacking in features for the average traveler,Although Ms. Wade describes all the sections of Arizona with area maps it is lacking in the amount of where to stay info. I found the book's format hard to follow. An index divided by subject would have helped and detailed maps. I will stick with Fodors travel books.
2,Not Blue Streak!,"Instead of Blu Streak the seller sent me Starbar Golden Malrin fly bait. It's similar to Blu Streak but not nearly as effective. I scatered the bait yesterday, around the dumpsters, and still have a lot of flys today. Blu Streak usually takes care of 90% of the flys within a 24 hour period.I wish I had been contacted about the change in product."
5,Dated yet relevant...,"While this book is a bit dated (original title completed in 1958), the author details many early foundational battles of the AMA against relevant and effective cancer therapies. It's an insider look at the juggernaut machine that is the AMA. If you want a nice background and understanding of why effective therapies are sacrificed at the alter of big pharma & medical profits, read this book.Incidentally, Nat Morris & Maurice Natenberg are one & the same. I bought both editions of the book & figured that out."
4,IT NEEDS PHOTOS DESPERATELY,"I got really disappointed upon receiving this book.I'm not saying that it is no good, I agree with all the other reviewers on the recipies and the information of the book.The thing that really annoyes me is that in this great effort of a book ,to exhibit the Thai cuisine, there is not a single coloured photograph in the book.In fact the only photos there are are black and white ,tiny and have nothing to do with the recipies or Thailand to that matter.Not everybody is familiar with Thai cuisine and pictures of the ingredients and the methods of cooking would have been very helpful.If you are one of those people that like to be challenged by a photograph of a dish so as to try it then this book is not for you."
2,"May Be Authentic, but many recipies are AWFUL","I have used many thai cookbooks over the years, and this one was absolutly the worst. Most of the recipies are rather bland in flavor or way overdone in spices.If you are someone that is looking to make the flavers you find in thai restaurants....this is NOT the book for you.Because of the other reviews I bought this book, but apparently it's recipies are VERY authentic thai.....and what is served in restaurants isn't.My advice.....check the book out at the library and TRY it. Then if you like it, buy one."
3,pretty good,"The red curry is AMAZING, but 4 other recipes I tried were terrible. I wasn't crazy about the pad thai either- it didn't taste like the kind I've bought at restaurants. Because I love red curry, I'll give the book 3 stars. But the other recipes weren't great."
1,Trash,"Really don't like this thermometer. It cost our 3 week old a spinal tap. It is very inconsistent and not very user friendly. The setting for axillary, rectal or oral is hard to read and just getting the thing to work isn't very easy. I would not recommend this product to anyone with a baby. The only positive thing I can say, is that it does give a quick reading in the oral or rectal setting. However, it is hard to know if you are in the oral or rectal setting and you can't trust the reading that you get."
4,"Penguin Love - a review of ""I Like It When...""","Now known as Paz and Big Penguin (from the early morning television shorts), these unnamed penguins appear in bright primary colors and discuss what they like about their day.I like it when you hold my hand.... let me help.... we eat new things.Three and a Half Stars. Attractive book that small fry are bound to like. The fact that the big and small penguins have no names or obvious gender is nice and allows for a caregiver to say 'look, that's me and that is you'."
2,Won't help for AEPA...at all!,"If you have the AEPA in your future this book will not help you at all, and it should not even be listed on the cover of this book! The book also provides a description of the test layout that is completely inaccurate.Other things that bothered me with this study guide were the constant misspelling of words and disorganized sentences. Some sentences either contain words that aren't supposed to be there, or important words are left out leaving you guessing."
4,Really helped with the MTEL!,"Book was great for studying Math, English, Science,and History sections. I never learned American history, but I was able to get everything I needed from this book.My only complaint is that the information provided for the Child Development area wasn't in-depth enough. It covered the basics, but didn't focus on enough theorists. Luckily I was a psychology major, and was able go to my psch books for info.One recommendation is start studying early. There is a lot of information to cover and you don't want to start cramming the week before the exam...like we did :-)Still passed though!"
2,Just took the OSAT!!,"Just took the OSAT subtest one and this book will NOT help you! It's full of great information, but not information thats on the test! Save your money and download the free review from the registration website. This book doesn't match the competencies on the test."
5,1989's BEST ALBUM,"I can't believe that I never heard this album till 16 years after it's release. You owe it to yourself to give it a listen. Definately some of Michael Hutchence best vocal work. The album is great from start to finish but really shines in the haunting ""Concrete"" and ""Monday Night By Satellite"". It is truly a shame we won't get to hear anymore of this collaboration."
1,Appalling waste of money,"Badly written, badly structured, and of minimal practical use. Despite the blurb - it is difficult to believe that the author can have done business in Japan. The information content is shallow and in many cases the author clearly fails to understand what he is talking about. Originally, I wondered if I was overreacting, but having talked to some friends who also bought the book looking for information and insights into marketing in Japan, it became clear that this book is really that bad. Do not bother with this book."
3,A satisfying album,"I think that Trouble Walkin' is a good album. It was released in 1989 and consists of ten tracks. Overall, the songwriting is worthy, the musicianship is tight, and the sound quality is pleasant. The material is in a straight-ahead hard rock musical direction. Ace Frehley and Richie Scarlet do a solid job handling the guitar work. Examples of cuts that I enjoy are ""Shot Full of Rock,"" ""Do Ya,"" and ""Fractured III."" ""Shot Full of Rock,"" the opening song, is an energetic, no-frills one that exhibits forceful vocals from Frehley and cool guitar playing. ""Do Ya""--a cover of an Electric Light Orchestra tune--is catchy and fun, while the closing instrumental ""Fractured III"" is a well-written, nice piece. I recommend this album."
3,A solid piece of hard rock,"This is a solid piece of hard rock, with strong musicians and good production. But some of the songs are simply weak, and nou amount of musicianship can save them. Anyway, it's an enjoyable album, even if you've never heard about KISS. Ace can live without his pals; the problemis that he's too lazy to record albums. TROUBLE WALKIN was his LAST solo effort, and it was released in 1991..."
3,Good Effort,"Can Ace be a solo act.Yes,but it's too bad Ace is such a loser.This album once again shows Ace is a viable talent all on his own.He even pulls off Hide your Heart better than Paul Stanley but Ace continues to fall of the wagon and in turn off the charts."
3,Peter Criss only played /sang backup!,"I have read a couple of reviews on this cd and it should be pointed out that Richie Scarlett sang lead on 2 Young 2 Die. Peter sang backup on a few songs, featured primarily on Trouble Walkin'."
3,Ace still rocks - but not much of a writer,"It's funy that the best tracks on this CD are not original Ace works. Do Ya is a cover that I really enjoy. The straight-ahead riff is very cool - and Ace's vocals are good.Hide your Heart is a bit of an enigma. This must have been a time where Ace, Paul, and Gene were buddies. Honestly, I like Ace's version better than KISS'Overall, this album is average. Ace isn't that strong of a writer but his guitar work is very distinctive."
1,Never again,I bought this cd as a christmas present for my boyfriend and he was so excited. When he opened but when he played the cd it skips. I Don't think I will every buy a cd from this website again
3,"Toasts 2 or 4 slices fine, burns 1 or 3 slices","This toaster works ok, but not nearly as well as I had hoped. You can toast either 2 or 4 slices quite well, but if you try to toast a single slice or 3 slices, the slice that is by itself always ends up burnt. Kitchen Aid would have done much better by making this toaster with four individual slots, rather than 2 long slots. A single slice of toast just can't take all the heat that the long slot puts out. Also, you always have to turn down the heat for subsequent batches by at least 1 notch, even though KitchenAid claims you will not have to. I did time it, and subsequent batches are shorter, as they are supposed to be, but the toast still gets burnt if you don't turn it down. Tried the frozen function with bread and it worked fine. Haven't tried bagels yet."
1,Rate this a negative 3,"I bought this thing from amazon over a year ago, it never worked right. But a least it only caught bread on fire a couple of times. We have gone round and round with Kitchen Aid over getting a replacement. They won't honour the warranty. At the very least Amazon should drop it. RUN!"
2,"""Not so hot"" toaster","I bought this toaster to replace my old Kitchen Aid toaster, expecting the same quality and results. It looks nice, but I was not happy with it at all. As a mom of five children, I didn't want to spend all morning in the kitchen, which is why I bought the large toaster. The consistency of the toaster was not there. My toast would burn even on lower settings. Although it looks great and does have some nice features such as accomodating different sizes of bread, etc. I put it back in the box and bought a Cuisinart instead."
3,Not a good value for the price,"I purchased our Kitchenaid four-slice toaster about four years ago and have found it somewhat disappointing, especially considering what we paid for it. I based my decision to purchase it on the favorable, even glowing reviews some people gave the product, choosing to disregard as aberrations the more negative ones that described uneven browning or projectile toast. Well, we don't experience projectile toast, but we have yet to get an evenly browned piece of toast from this toaster. The toaster does look very nice and is sturdy, but it is not worth the nearly eighty dollar price we paid for it. I would never recommend this product to anyone as a good value. It's not a lemon, but it certainly hasn't lived up to our expectations. My advice is to look elsewhere and save your money."
2,"Snap, crackle and POP!!","I've had the toaster for 3 weeks. I didn't like the fact that both slots heat when I'm only using one - it seems like that should have been easy to change - but it toasted okay until one morning the thing began snarling and then snap, crackle and POP! a flash of light and a smell of sulphur (okay, maybe I imagined that) and suddenly breakfast had turned into a game of Russian roulette. I tried it again on two more mornings but finally had to return the toaster to the store as I've already redecorated my kitchen and am not aiming for the towering inferno decor.I was hoping this was a fluke and had wanted to buy another one, but now that I've read the reviews, I'll look at other brands."
2,"No sir, I don't like it.",The lowest setting is too dark for my taste when making toast. Enough said.
3,Blowing Fuses,"Satisfied with the the toast function although it takes some practice to get it right.It may be the house circuitry, but this toaster has tripped the breaker three times in 4 weeks. Smoke residue noticed on outlet. Not good! Will follow closely."
1,"If you don't believe me, see my photo.","I have the black version, but I'm writing reviews for the white and red as well to save you from buying this toaster model. From day one, it hasn't been able to toast anything evenly - be it frozen / fresh /refrigerated bread / bagel / english muffin - you name it. If you don't believe me, see the photo I uploaded. The toast is burnt and raw at the same time!"
1,Kitchenaid Toaster - Works for 2 years.,"I bought this toaster 2 years ago.Now, when you push down on the handlethe toast won't stay down, and ifyou do happen to get to stay down,the toast doesn't toast.Not recommended, unless you get anew toaster every 2 years anyway."
3,Good looking toaster does an adequate job,I wanted a toaster that could toast any thickness bread or bagel and didn't have a huge footprint on my counter. This toaster looks great on the counter and does an adequate job. I wouldn't give it 4 stars as it sometimes toast unevenly. Depending on the thickness (usually with thinner slices of bread)the edges will be too crispy when the center hasn't reached a nice toast.
3,Multi-functioned Toaster,"KitchenAid KTT570WH 4-Slice Digital Toaster with Bagel, Warm, and Frozen Functions, WhiteIt took the place of a 30 year old 4 slice toaster and a bagel toaster. It's nice to have just one toaster. We have found that you need to adjust the numbers on the toaster depending on which feature you are using. It does a nice job on the defrost/bagels. Providing you put it on the right setting. If it isn't done evenly, put it back in for a little bit more. It does take more work than our old ones. We never had to fiddle with the settings on either the old toaster or the old bagel toaster. It is very hard to find a LONG 4 slice toaster as most of them are wide. This takes up less space on our counter. We doubt that this will last 30 years, but we're very glad to have one that is nice, sleek and does a reasonable job. Just remember, if it doesn't come out evenly browned on all sides, next time you use that type of bread, turn it up a notch and it will be more evenly browned."
2,Not Worth the Price,"Difficult to follow and read; concepts and important points not clearly presented (especially ch. 1). Dry. Not worth the price; they advertise FREE access for practice quizzes etc.(hardcover version). However,the web study tool is ridiculous; it is incomplete, and honestly, useless. The hardcover version is an expensive book, and many cheaper text books offer more supportive web study tools. I was very disappointed for this book."
2,Misguided,"As a textbook, the information is clear and well-laid out. The writers of the books should have stopped there; unfortunately, they instead insisted on threading the textbook with ongoing vignettes about 3 families of ""diverse"" backgrounds. As an earlier reader noted, it is multiculturism gone terribly wrone. It is HORRIBLY cliche - especially in the case of the token fictional African American family. This family, whose members include ""Malcolm and Momma Jo Williams"" and who say things like ""you gon' be one sorry chile,"" represent stereotype and prejudice at its worst. Its surprising that DeHart and her colleagues didn't include fried chicken and watermelons in descriptions of the family diet."
1,Much room for improvement,"I noticed that there will be a new edition of this text - I hope the authors took the criticisms of the old edition to heart. After using this book for a child development course, I was horrified to see how indeed very racist some parts of this book are. And it's the kind of new-age, oblivious breed of racism that is ironically based in a compulsion to be ""diverse"" and politically correct.The depiction of the black family was too stereotypical - and thus offensive - for words. It almost became a satire of middle-class liberal racism, because the story of ""Malcolm and Momma Jo"" is obviously the way that the authors perceive the lifestyle of a typical African American family. Sroufe, et al should be ashamed of themselves.These comments are meant to be constructive. I'm actually passionate about my psychology studies, have a 4.0 and hope to be a psychiatrist. I feel incredibly disappointed, shortchanged and offended to have had this book as our required text."
2,Misguided,"As a textbook, the information is clear and well-laid out. The writers of the books should have stopped there; unfortunately, they instead insisted on threading the textbook with ongoing vignettes about 3 families of ""diverse"" backgrounds. It is multiculturism gone terribly wrong. It is HORRIBLY cliche - especially in the case of the token fictional African American family. This family, whose members include ""Malcolm and Momma Jo Williams"" and who say things like ""you gon' be one sorry chile,"" represent stereotype and prejudice at its worst. With this kind of blatant bias, DeHart and her colleagues might as well have included fried chicken and watermelons in descriptions of the family diet."
2,"Too fast, interpretation is off","A friend loaned me this recording to sample Anthony Newman. Until now, I had not heard any of his recordings.First, something positive. Newman is a technician of the keyboard, he exhibits a lot of ability.Unfortunately, the virtuosity he displays happens to be his downfall. Everything is over the line of being too fast. Although he does not get to the degree Virgil Fox did, he still goes way over the line. Particularly for organ works such as those of Franck, Newman's excessively fast tempi kill much of the artistic value of the composer's works. His registration sounds off a bit too. Finally, the sound quality of the recording is not great either.I recommend staying away from this recording."
1,Does not last long,I bought this for our office and was extremely dissatisfied with it. It stopped working after only 8 months of light use (storing our milk for coffee). Save yourself some grief and get a better known brand.
1,i feel betrayed,"I needed a mini-frige for my home office and saw this little gem at a decent price so I bought it. Little did I know I was buying such a heap. It's loud, freezes everything, ever tried drinking from a frozen milk carton? If you don't get enough junk mail, put an order in for this piece of misery.Never heard of this brand name, but there engineers obviously work ""haier"" than their competition."
5,GO TO BEST BUY INSTEAD!!!,"I have no doubt that this little fridge is going to be fantastic based on these reviews. The only problem is that I paid TWICE as much for this one (120$) when it's being offered at BestBuy for 65 and there's NO shipping!!! Also, be forewarned that if you place an order your window of opportunity isn't more than 5 minutes to cancel it with amazon.com. I found the besy buy offer 5 minutes later, came to my account here to cancel and it was ""already in the shipping process"" and yet I'm going to have to wait a full week for it to get here. Again, I'm sure the fridge is great but the cost and service are not."
3,it's ok,"I bought the Haier Compact Refrigerator &amp; Freezer about 4 months ago. It was difficult to control the temp in the first 2 days of operation. The door shelf is small (it would've been perfect had they not squeezed in another shelf)and hard to fit much into. the freezer does accumulate some ice but I stopped using the item before the ice got thick. the bottom shelf refrigerates nicely while the top shelf outside of and under the freezer, freezes almost everything. Other then that I'd say this freezer is worth the money but I'd recommend it more for more light use. Oh, and according to the energystar label, this particular appliance is not energy efficiant costing about $26 per year to run."
4,Great for the office!,"It's super quiet, I don't even know it's there, and holds all the food I need at work. It's not as roomy as I anticipated - I have to lay my boxed milk container on its side on the bottom, but it works very well overall."
3,works great,"I got this fridge for my college dorm room last fall. It worked great, but I did have a few problems getting the temperature adjusted at first... the freezer compartment is so small and doesn't really keep things frozen. So if you're looking for a small fridge, this is great. My only complaint is that it was too small for my needs - I couldn't even fit a 2-liter in the door, I had to take out the main shelf to fit the 2-liter in there. I just bought the Haier 4.0cf fridge/freezer instead. But this one does work great, I don't know why everyone else had problems with it being too cold, it was just too small for me."
4,Happy I took a Chance,"I needed a mini frig for my office and saw the Haier unit in a target store, then I went to target.com and read the reviews and was alittle concerned. But, when I looked at the unit in the store and then shopped around at the competition, the Haier frig seemed to be of better quality and it appears to be true. Works GREAT!!!Thanks, Jim"
1,Broken before you know it,"I too purchased this refrigerator for my personal office use. It worked fine for 3 weeks, then it started to make a loud humming noise for about 3 days until it completely stopped working. I am very dissapointed with this product."
1,Works great as a FREEZER!,"I took a chance after reading the reviews and purchased this refrigerator. Sadly on the ""warmest"" setting it cools to 22 degrees--nice frozen solid gallons of juice were the results.The refrigerator will be making a return trip and I'll be searching for a replacement."
1,Haier Products Stink and so does their customer support,I bought a Haier convection oven and it broke after only a few months. I called their customer service department and they said they would send me a new one. I have waited 2 months and made 17 phones and still nothing. DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS COMPANY. Their products are cheap chinese junk and they DO NOT stand behind their products. Don't believe me? Look around on the web and you will see plenty of other people complaining about their cheap products and ZERO customer support.
1,Throw it out,"I bought this fridge for my office. Within a couple of months, the freezer part turned into solid ice and then started leaking. I threw it out."
4,Barbie Sng with Me Boom Box,My three year old loves to hear the sound of her own voice and to sing along with the songs. A fun toy. It's a little hard for her to put the fake CD's in the fake player because you have to line then up perfectly in order to be able to close the cover.
3,Love the Canes but...,"This game was the last great bowl victory for one was one of the most dominating college football teams ever. After having been denied a chance to play in the BCS title game in 2001 by a flawed system, dominating college football the following year to win the Rose Bowl and National Championship, and then being robbed of a national championship by an official who threw a flag AFTER the fireworks went off in the Fiesta Bowl in 2003 the Canes settled in to play their Archrivals in the Orange Bowl. This game was low scoring, slow, and in many ways sloppy. It was really the result of two great defenses playing two average offenses. If you like the Canes I recommend the DVD for the 2002 Rose Bowl instead. The best part about this DVD however is that you can see how FSU QB Chris Rix probably still has nightmares about UM safety Sean Taylor.PS I hope the ref who threw that flag in OT of the 2003 Fiesta Bowl gets AIDS."
5,This is a replacement.,"I've worn through 2, one a cassett and the other a CD , so I had to replace them :)"
4,"Interesting prologue to ""Streets""","I always thought Savatage reached their creative peek with ""Streets"" even though they released some excellent albums following that. No matter what, ""Gutter Ballet"" is a very interesting album that serves as an introduction to what was about to come. The songs are not yet fully orchestrated and lack the elements of ""Streets"" and afterwards Savatage but that doesn't make them bad. Very interesting moments on the album are the title track, ""When the Crowds are Gone"", ""Hounds"" and ""Thorazine Shuffle"". I can't say much about this album rather than if you like Savatage you'll probably like this one as well. Again if you're a fan of progressive/power metal, this is one of the best in the genre so get this one..."
5,My favourite Savatage album,"It took me 6 years to find a copy of this disc in Canada I found it at a used cd store for $6can, thats about $3us,to me its priceless. This is most definitely my favourite disc in the world! I now have two copies of it in case I wear one out! Every song on this disc is too good for words to describe. If you dont have it, buy it you wont be disappointed. Its AMAZING!!!"
1,I hate it,"Is ""Of Rage and War"" the only good song that Savatage wrote? If you like the classic roaring riffs of the late 80's, then trust me, you'll love ""Of Rage and War"" and hate the rest!!!!!!!!!"
4,One Of The Finest Hardrock Releases.,"If it weren't for their earlier album ""Hall of the Mountain King,"" this album would be my favorite. It's really a tie. You can't beat this album. Something for everyone on here. The most diverse Savatage album. Try on ""Thorazine Shuffle,"" ""Of Rage and War,"" and ""Summer's Rain"" for size. Musically heavy and grandiose. If you're new to Savatage, this album or ""Hall of the Mountain King"" are the best in my opinion."
4,gutter ballet,"after seeing the transyberian orchestra, i bought a couple of this groups' cd's. a nice change of pace with progressive rock flavor and excellant dynamics."
4,Nice and smooth,"I've found this cd, when I was looking for good sounding cd's.The music is smooth and great, and gives you pleasure even if you are talking with friends/family or only listening to the music.So I'm glad I let it shipped to Europe!"
4,"comprehensive, well-written and entertaining","Sturat Walton's expertise both as a journalist and wine conoisseur shows in thei beautifully produced tour around the world of wine. Each country, and each grape type, is discussed in some depth, with suggestions for tasting and travel. It makes a great gift for someone interested in wine."
3,Wine Encyclopedia,This book was purchased as an addition to my reference library. Provides a basic descrption of the wine market. Many examples but by no means all inclusive. Arrived as described.
2,Nothing there,"I wish this smelled like something on the clothes but really useless. Too bad, i love ms myers...After your clothescome out they smell just the same, no effect"
2,Lifebuoy soap,"This IS NOT the original ""Lifebuoy"" soap as sold by ""the Old Vermont Country Store"". I'll know better the next time."
1,"This was NOT the Original product, I feel the advertisement wasn't totally honest","I buy Lifebouy soap as a preference, this is not the original soap as I feel I was lead to believe.. the original soap is still made in England..this is made in India... nothing like the original....and i won't use it as who knows what it is made of...."
5,Customer,Soap was gift for someone who is unable to obtain. Said was best Christmas gift he received. Better than his thousand plus dollar chair.
1,C++ Primer,"The worst textbook I've ever used. I'm trying to learn C++ and I find this book to be confusing, to say the least. The method of showing three or four wrong ways to do something before showing the correct method is totally exasperating. I have completely lost all faith in this book as a learning tool. A complete and total waste of time, effort and money!"
2,Poorly organized,"You can get by with this book (I own the 3rd edition and was assigned a much earlier one in a C++ class I took in 1995).The book's main flaw is that it relies on examples so heavily that it's very difficult to use as a reference. While I realize the book was not written as a pure reference, the authors could isolate reference text (definitions and so on) from example text and make the book much more readable."
1,What could I say?,"Don't buy this book if you want to be a C++ guru. The examples are too basic and obvious. This book is good for novices, if you have a good knowledge of C++ you will repeat yourself ten thousand times.I suggest Deitel & Deitel, C++ how to program. This book is awesome you'll be amazed (good for novices as well)."
1,A reference and a uncomprehendible one. Pure deceit.,This book is reference and NOT a primer.Not for beginners. Mostly for C software developers who need a reference/tutorial.The Authors of this book got exactly what they wanted .They Claimed their book as a PRIMER for beginners and ripped alot of people off expecting a book just for beginners.The Authors need to be SUED for the title. It's pure deceitful advertising .Buy Stroustrups book if you want to impress your friends or can really understand it. Stroustrups and this book are both unreadable references.
3,Meh.,"A very comprehensive discussion of C++. It has a number of flaws. For example, it advocates the use of certain coding idioms that are just stupid, such as using != in loop counters instead of <. But, it contains almost everything you need to know about the C++ language itself."
4,Excellent In Depth Info,"Excellent thorough book. Not for novice programmers. After reading this book, you know C++ inside out."
3,This book is not comprehesive,"At 1236 pages of text, I would expect that this tome be a fairly comprehesive overview of the C++ language. Guess what? There is no discussion of the keyword ""struct"". While it is possible to program without ""struct"", a discussion of it and the authors' preferences for its use is important, particularly for those coming from a C background."
3,"Excellent for experienced C++ programmers, but no ""primer""","This book is a fine choice for a 3rd or 4th C++ text in an experienced professional's library. For an audience already well acquainted with C++ and object-oriented programming the presentations are clear, the examples are realistic, and the recommended techniques are generally enlightened.However this book is no ""primer"". The strange sequence of topics will confuse the C++ neophyte. Vitally important basic OOP concepts like inheritance are put off for over 800 pages, while highly specialized advanced notions such as certain STL containers and algorithms appear near the beginning, often with insufficient explanation."
5,The Best C++ Book,"This is by far the best C++ book I have ever read. It is comprehensive, explanations are simple and to the point, and, up-to-date. I am referring to the 4th edition, of course. The earlier editions might be a bit outdated."
2,There are much better C++ books than this one.,"This book is horrible. I did not like the teaching style from the begining but wanted to give it a chance. Waste of time. The authors gloss over hundreds of pages of material with very little if any explanation. The first 200 pages are littered with new words, expressions, and concepts with REFERENCES to later chapters.(This gets very annoying due to the frecuency of use) The teaching style is awful. There are way better books out there. To the authors credit they do explain the layout of the book but after experiencing it I can say; it wasn't worth it."
1,One of the worst entry level books on programming,"This book is hardly a ""Primer"". A primer should contain more entry-level concepts. This book seems to be an attempt on the author's part to demonstrate his vast knowledge as a programmer. Ok, we're impressed, but it does not help us learn. He will give a cursory explanation of a concept and present a snippet of code. The code invariably contains some concept not explained in the previous text, but possibly addressed in subsequent chapters. This is not helpful. The text immediately after the code snippet also does not explain the code example, but merely moves on to the next topic. There are no graphics, no full programs examples, and no organization. Full program examples are crucial in a primer. This book should be renamed to ""Advanced C++ Programming"". Do not buy this book!!!"
2,The authors assume too much,"This might have been a good book on C++ programming if the authors did not assume any prior knowledge of C++ on the reader's part. The way information is presented in the book is much too difficult to grasp (and i'm not a beguinner in programming) - the reader is drowned by the complexity (or maybe good explanation) of programming examples. I do understand that the authors know a lot about C++, but the book falls short of trying to explain the language in a clear and easy-to-understand manner. The bottom line is - look somewhere else for a good C++ textbook. P.S. The book that i personally liked reading is called ""C++ primer plus""."
1,"Not for beginners, not for reference.","8 years ago, my professor used it as textbook to teach us computer students C++. I couldn't understand the book. I hated Lippman. I somewhat doubted my intelligence.Having programmed 8 years in C/C++, I can read it all right. But it's not well organized to be used as reference. One thing is for sure now. It's not me; it's the author."
4,C++ Primer 2nd Edition: A review,"Lippman's book contains an introduction into the world of programming in the C++ language. The book goes from simple basics, assuming you know the basic foundations of a programming language, to in depth coverage of C++ programming. It explains both with examples of the programming language and with detailed explanations of what everything in the explanations means and does. This book is an excellent tool for both learning the C++ language and referencing back while you are working on programming something. However, it is not for the every day reader, as it requires a previous knowledge of basic programming language."
4,Do not be intimidated by the first two chapters,"I bought this book a few months ago. I was put off by its girth, and I didn't really pick it up till a week ago. In retrospect, it is really useful. I want to learn C++ in a rigorous manner. The exercises in the book really help me to understand the concepts in the text. I bought Bjarne Stroutstrup's book and I thought spent too much time extolling the language's virtues. We all know that we have to learn C++. Authors should edit out the pontification and just give us the important lessons straight. The C++ Primer manages to do that.Negatives:Source code on supporting web-site doesn't really compile under VC++.Need to buy answer book to get answers on exercises (just got mine).Bottom Line:Buy this book if you want to learn C++ and some have previous programming experience."
2,"Very confusing, shows what NOT to do without explanation","I have used this book extensively and although the authors are well-known C++ experts, I find their method of showing (with code) what not to do a poor teaching and reference mechanism...the code that they demonstrate is often not followed up with corrected code and it is all very fragmented. Please note: this is not in any way a beginners book!"
2,Reader,"One of the more ill-organized programming text I have come across so far in 10 years. Poor examples,very few complete codes in the text and confusing explanations. Concepts are presented throughout the text,amazingly this book shall serve neither an experienced programmer or a beginner to C++. Why did Lippman name it a primer??To convince yourself, flip through the pages that deal with the implementation of a vector and string class and you will recognize why this text deserves, at certain places, a ""1"" star rating.Some codes even crash your system...certainly not an ideal text to begin C++ and possibly even flirting with the ""horrible"", if you are new to programming."
1,!!!THIS BOOK IS HORRIBLE - DO NOT GET IT!!!!!!!!!!!,"I wouldn't give this book any stars if possible, because this is the worst C++ book that I have ever had. The text feels like it is written in another language. The examples are completely retarded. Things that should be very simple to understand are suddenly mind boggling. Whoever wrote this book and is making me use it in this class really sucks, just like this book. I am a second year college student in Computer Science and this book is the worst book that I have had yet.!!!! IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WHATEVER YOU DO -DO NOT GET THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"this book is not a primer, nor a decent reference item","this book is completely useless. it is nowhere near a primer, yet lacks enough substance for a reference book.. instead it lingers somewhere in the middle serving no purpose what-so-ever.i wish i hadn't bought this book, it's a waste of money."
1,Stay away from this one,Unless you are going to write a C++ compiler this is not the book for you. I have 20 years experience programming including Java and C and by the time I was half way through the book I could bearly understand him. Clearly there are better choices.
1,Doesn't live up to 2nd edition,I am an experienced C/C++ programer and I have used the C++ Primer 2nd edition for quite a few years I and think it is excellent. I have owned this 3rd edtion for about a year now and I find it completely useless as a reference. Lippman's examples run on and take too long to get to the point. The book is about twice the length of the 2nd edition and winds up diluting the information and making it less clear as opposed to pressenting anything new.
2,Misaligned,"Start at the end of the book and read it backwards , or take a box knife and rearrange the book as needed. Good luck."
1,Cannot be worse!,This book does not teach but rather can be used as a reference book. I have read a few books that much boring! I do not recommend anyone to buy this book if you want to learn C++. It is also very confusing.
1,"REALLY, REALLY BAD BOOK....","I been programming for about 7 years. (JAVA, VB, PASCAL, C) I knew about 60% of what C++ was about. I took a formal class so that I can learn it the right way. We used this book what a bad experience. BAD organization some old ANSI Standards that do not exist anymore in today's programming. Subjects were not organized at all. On the beginning chapters Lippman was all over the place CH15, CH18... Nothing was from the beginning. TERRIBLE...TERRIBLE...TERRIBLEI try to get just to the style of the book but it was impossible. I end it up buying another book ""SCHILDT"" great book I learned it right. I got an A on my class. Now is all I do C++."
2,Head for higher water....,"I'm quite confused about who the intended audience of this book is for. The book's cover would suggest that its for beginners but it is written in such a way that a beginner would have a tough time with it. And it is not an advanced book by my definition. What really ruined this book is the rediculous layout of the book. Whoever made the decision to write this book this way should be forced to program in Prolog for the next 6 months or read the entire ""War And Peace"" while standing on one foot. You don't present material early in a book and then explain it many chapters later! This goes against the human thought proccess. The material should have been presented with some semblance of logical order! Lippman knows his stuff, he just does'nt know how to write. I would recommend passing this one over for a more clearly written book."
3,not for beginner...,"I found this book hard to follow. Information is so scattered. There is an overview for the whole book, for every part and every chapter! sometime you see something like 'I'll explain later'. but until then I'm already confused. One biggest shortcome of online book shopping is that you can't preview and compare the books with similar topics. So before you hit the 'submit order' button, you had better preview the book from other source. I found 'customer review' sometime not trustworthy."
2,Overall comprehensive,"This books has lots of detailed information. However, I felt that it lacks code examples, explaining the textual descriptions."
1,Be aware from that one !!!,"I'm a C++ expert, used to write a hardcore system programs on Windows NT operating system,I just borrowed this book from the library to revise a solid code to give some C++ course, so my opinion isIt's very poor organized !!!!Thats all"
1,Not the best out there,"While this book does have some useful info, there are MANY books out there that are MUCH better. The best thing I can think of is that the pages have a very nice texture, but that doesn't say much."
3,Kindle Edition Code Examples Illegible,"As a user of this loathsome language - c++11 looks better - for over twenty years I agree with the positive reviews for the dead-tree fourth edition; it's best in 'class'.My concern with the Kindle edition is that the code examples are not only printed in small type, but also printed in a faint gray-scale. Why? This makes the book almost useless under anything less than full sun or a spotlight. I use a Kindle 3."
4,"Very informative, but disorganized","An extremely informative book, in fact far more informative than C++ for dummies and Learn C++ in 21days. I would not recommend it as a refernce as the topics are not well organized. Beginners should read something else first as this book is quite technical. But if you know C programming or any other OOP language, this book beats every other C++ book."
3,"Complete reference, but exteremly disorganized","I use this book all the time as a reference, but if you are learning C++, this is probably one of the worst books you can get. It is highly disorganized and would discourage any student of C++. The authors routinely refer to subjects that have not been discussed or are covered a few chapters ahead.But as a reference to c++, if you are already a C++ programmer, it is probably one of the best ANSI C++ books out there and subjects are covered clearly, that is if you already know C++.For a beginner I recommend Object-Oriented Programming in C++ (4th Edition) by Robert Lafore."
2,a bad book for a beginner,"Although a ""complete"" book on C++, the writing style leaves a lot to be desired. The chapters are in a strange order and the presentation of material is chaotic. I can see how this book would dicourage a beginner."
2,Not for beginners,"This is a not a PRIMER for BEGINNERS.In three chapters the author skims over the basics, providing VERY LITTLE basic information and few examples. Then, in the remaining seven chapters and four appendix, dives into complex and esoteric advanced features of C++. The proper title for this book would have been 'Advanced programming techniques in C++'. There is almost nothing of value her for beginning C++ programmers."
4,Very friendly book on C++,"C++ Primer is very easy to understand but if you are new to C++, don't panic if you get confused by the first two chapters.If you already know C++, you'll learn a lot from this book. But unfortunately it's not as comprehensive as I expected."
3,Original Insights On Fascism(s),"Mosse gives us here a collection of essays published in different journals and over a period of years, yet they are all distinguished by a search for fresh insights into the still-relevant phenomenon of fascism (as with the recent upsurge of the Nationalist Right in several European countries). There are some errors (Brasillach was never married and some historical sequences are unaccountably off), but the small volume is well worth exploring."
2,Width is way too narrow,"I ordered a pair at 6 1/2 WW (EE). For that size and width, according to standard sizing charts, the sole should be 3 3/4-4"" wide at the widest. These are 3 1/4"". According to standard size charts, that would be a C width at most.It's really too bad, as these appear to be very attractive boots otherwise. Why bother advertising and supporting widths if your widest size is so narrow."
2,"Smallest subtance, nicely packaged","I was very surprised by the gap between my expectations, based on the smart title and the well organized table of contents, and the lack of relevant content of this book.If you have some little working experience and you want to enter into a consultancy job, here you may find some basic advice about how to position your role (part I), how to get and organize your sources (part II), how to critically review the inputs you receive (part III).Do not rely on part IV and V, however, if you are looking for a guidance to create value for your client: here you will find just a number of anecdots bringing to very basic advices.My conclusion is that for both, junior consultants or experienced professionals, there are much better reference than this."
2,Don;t be fooled by the title. 3/4th of the book is fluff,I was expecting a lot more from this book (perhaps as it comes recommended by Josh Kauffman). However this book is a lot of fluff. Case in point section about getting organized. It does have some interesting tidbits but honestly you could find those with a little research online.Definitely not worth the money.
2,Highly overrated.,"There is extremely little in this book that (a) pertains to the title and (b) is not plain commonsense.Most of the book is about fluff that could apply to just about any situation (""be curious"", ""be organized"", ""be critical about examining data"").Hrrmph."
5,A Clear and Concise Guide for Critical Thinkers,"Dr. Koomey presents an excellent, concise, comprehensive, and extremely well written compilation of guidelines, common sense, and ""rules of behavior"" for analysts and anyone interested in critical thinking, performing evaluations, and/or engaged in public presentations, written or oral. In particular, this book should be a ""must"" read for those entering the teaching and research professions. I wish it had been available prior to my professional career."
1,Surprisingly disappointing,"I saw a number of positive reviews of this book and thought the book should be good. I was very disappointed after borrowing it from the library. The book rarely offered anything new or challenging. Many of the topics that the author highlighted are just common sense. Thus, a reader will walk away from the book and would not feel as if he/she had learned anything. To be fair, I did not finish the book, I finished 3/4 of it. But completing 3/4 of the book is quite a difficult task; it was quite difficult to stay awake and concentrated on the material. I felt obligated to write this review because I thought that the ratings of this book are very inaccurate and I should help potential readers from wasting their time/money. One star is the lowest rating that can be given here, but given a choice a 0 star rating would be more appropriate."
3,Huh? What am I missing? This is all so basic!,"I bought this book due to the overwhelmingly positive reviews - thought it would really get into the meat of the issue and provide some creative insight. What a disappointment! It is very user-friendly...to the point of being almost insulting at times...very rudimentary. Provides little insight into anything new and is really just a primer. It may be good for college freshment or HS students that need an intro into problem solving via ""numbers"" or those seeking a quick refresher but for anyone who has ever worked with even basic research (of any type...business, science, economics) skip - it will bore you to tears. In places it is downright silly and I honestly can't understand how it obtained the reviews it did."
3,Basic info about numbers,"There were a few good concepts described in the book, but overall there wasn't much that I haven't heard elsewhere."
2,Victim of the 80's,"After recently purchasing this album, not having ever heard of it, I was hoping to hear something familiar from days past from the guitarist that has influenced my playing more than any other artist, but to my surprise this did not resemble anything that I could identify with. Those of us old enough to remember the 80'S realize they were the worst of times for music and I realized that maybe RT was just having to go with the flow on this one! I will say that on a couple of tracks there are some great guitar solos that I found myself skipping to and for those who enjoyed the 80'S style of music would probably like this album."
4,"Better than Passion,",I love this CD. Pattison is a great vocalist. Buy it and you will like every track.
5,great party fun,"everyone brings one pound of a meat (chicken, steak,scallops etc),two cups of veggies (onion, green pepper, mushroom, etc)various cheeses to add to the cooked meat and veggies.add the cheese to the scoop and broil.a fine wine completes the party. the Swissmar providesan evening of friendship and is easy to clean up after."
1,Not fit for European market,"I bought this raclette grill thinking it was the best available on the market. When it arrives in Sweden it has an american plug and needs 110V. The problem is, the power is so high, that there are no commercially available transformers to use. We ended up having to throw the whole thing away without using it. The supplier should know when shipping that there are very few places outside the US where a 110V machine can be used, and I would have expected a thorough warning from them."
5,Excellent product for the price.,Completely satisfied. First night entertaining went really well. Would recommend it. Looking forward to putting a lot more use into this product.
4,Racelette grill works great,"We purchased this grill after using a similar grill in Europe. The Swissair grill is a good buy and the grill works well. The only complaints we had are the little plastic flippers that come with the grill, they are useless to use to turn food and it would be nice to have a few recipes for the grill."
2,Too small for 8 Persons,"I know and love raclette dinners from my home country Germany, so I was happy to find some that will work in the US. I tried to find out what the dimensions of the raclettes offered are, but without success. There was no answer to get anywhere. The dimensions listed on this page are obviously bogus, Amazon can not be contacted and Swissmar doesn't answer to emails. So finally I decided to just order one and was really disappointed: this raclette is much smaller than the raclettes I'm used to from home. The size of the grill plate is just 24 cm x 36 cm. The dishes are just 8.5 x 8.5 cm. The dishes are all lined up to the two sites, you can't turn the handles of the ones at the end to the front sides. If you sit around a rectangular table, the guests at the front ends of the table will have trouble to reach theirs. This raclette might work for 4 persons but is not suitable for 8 as normal European raclettes are."
4,War enters the '90's,"While not their best (""Life Is So Strange"" and ""The World Is A Ghetto"" share that honour), ""Peace Sign"" is a respectable return for the band after a decade of sporadic touring and recording. War's passion for social justice, lean funk and racial integration remains blessedly intact, and such cuts as 'Homeless Hero', 'East LA' and the classic title track suggest that their message is timeless and still vital. A fine cd from funk's best visionairies."
3,"Good,but not the War of old","I was heavily into War in the 70's when they had their classic lineup(the one without Eric Burdon).There are only three original members from that lineup on this album;Lonnie Jordan,Howard Scott and Harold Brown.Lee Oskar does make a guest appearance on 3 songs also.There are some very good songs here that are of the original War sound,some funky and some mellow.The only thing is that the original members do not play together on all of the tracks,and the use of many different musicians makes the chemistry not what it was with the War from the 70's.But it is not a bad album.War's best music in my opinion was in the 70's."
1,Really bad Film,"I did not like this film. I wanted to learn the history of Wrigley Field and was very disappointed. It did not say anything about Wrigley Field, just about people who attended the games. I didnot like the films format and style."
4,great book,this is a great book for anybody to read. it's especially aimed towards high school students. it's true to life with the politics involved in a teenager's high school life and the successes and tragedies involved therein. can't wait to read more from this author.
4,great book,This is a great book. It's true to life and tells the true story surrounding the politics of high school life and relationships therein.
4,Jester's Down,"I really enjoyed Jester's Down. Dan has a great writing style that keeps your attention, with good character development, and evokes emotions. The story progression keeps you enthralled and knocks you for a loop at the end. If you like movies such as ""American History X"", ""Seven"", and ""Fight Club"" you'll enjoy how Dan tells his tale."
2,Good stuff but much too brief,I should have realized that 25 pieces on one CD that normally has 15 or 16 at best would be a problem. All are to short to really enjoy the great musicianship of the artists.
4,Good Deal,"I was sceptical of this product because of the low,low price. (I paid 9.63 plus s&h) I found this product to be high in quality. Basic design and has a nice finish. I did have to give the bottom piece of the micro-clamp a tap with a hammer to break it loose."
3,Additional Adhesive Needed,"The package contains foam darts with rubber tips that glow in the dark, and a sheet of glow-in-the-dark stickers to wrap around the shafts of the darts. The glow quality of the stickers is very good; they are bright and long-lasting once you charge them. However, the adhesive barely sticks to the darts, and the stickers peel off after a few minutes. Should be OK to fix them with Scotch tape."
2,Just Get Normal Darts,"These are just weak, flimsy, old-style darts (which works terribly in new guns) with a cool glow in the dark fea ture. They fire terribly in the Nerf Firefly Rev-8 and fire terribly in other guns. Get the Nerf M icro Dart (orange foam, blue tips) Refill Pack or the Tagger Darts, but the tagge r darts have trouble firing in the Maverick and the Firefly, which is ridicilous and a crue l way to force you to buy the more expensive Micro Darts"
1,They get lost,OK well you have to apply the stickers that make them glow in the dark. And of course they get lost. They were WAY too expensive in my opinion. We don't even know where they are anymore and I know I've thrown some away. The boys just play with the guns without any darts in them. I would not repeat this purchase.
2,"One works, the other doesn't","I ordered 2 of these Lorex DVRs for 2 different stores and both worked well upon setup. But after 6 months, one kept losing time, and pretty soon clock just stopped. It's still recording, but if the clock always says the same day, then you can't really scroll thru previous days recordings (there all the same day to the machine!). So it was still under warranty and we sent it back and they replaced it with a new one. Now, a year later, the same thing! So disappointed that we're getting a different system with a different brand. The other still works (fingers crossed) but still, it's just not a reliable brand."
2,Not worth the out of print price,"Don't spend more than $10 for this book. As it's out of print, you'll see some insane prices for it, and frankly, it's not worth it. It's a nice addition for the South Florida Gardener, but you'll get a lot more practical month-by-month instruction in Tom MacCubbin's book, Month-by-Month Gardening in Florida.I did like the FAQ's in this book and learned some things about pest management, etc. However, I would have been very disappointed with this book if I'd spent more than $10 bucks."
2,Not as comprehensive as I was hoping,"I was hoping for a book explaining the process of creating my own soft sculpture creations. Instead, this is a book full of ""projects"" for sewing stuff like puffy letters and faux fruit and vegetables. I would have liked a more detailed description of what I would find in this book before buying it but page views of the table of contents and etc were not available. I may keep it on my shelf for my daughter to use, but I'm not sure that the instructions are well written enough for a newbie to follow."
2,What a Disappointment,"Based on the previous review, I was looking forward to purchasing this book. What a disappointment! There is no index of projects, but I will include several: cactus everlasting, victorian violet hat, all American pie crust (why not bake one?!), starfish ornament, and so. I own a lot of sewing and crafts books, so I decided to overlook the nonsensical ""projects"" to see if I could extract technique (I own a high end computerized sewing machine like Bernina). There is nothing of value. I will donate the book to our library."
3,OK.....but....,"My search is for soft-sculpture fruits and vegetables to make using my hand-dyed fabrics. This book has a few, along with a number of other projects. But It doesn't have the ""produce"" I was wanting. I will probably make what is offered (autumn harvest veggies), and keep looking for the Perfect Pear!"
3,teeny-tiny,"Cute t-shirt, but insanely small sizes. Anorexically tiny. Don't order this unless you are super skinny."
1,horrible text,"As a graduate student who had to buy and use this book for a class, I strongly discourage using this book for teaching or for beginners to fuzzy logic. The problems created from the errors in problems and theorms causes more difficulty than working the actual problems.I would have given this book two stars, except for the fact that there are not nearly enough examples to complement the theorms. Neglecting examples and leaving the reader with just a long algorithm (which may or may not have typos) is fine for a reference, but not for a book that presents these concepts to the novice.I consider this book $95 not well spent."
1,Terrible Text,"I'd have given it 0 star if that's an option. It's full of errors, ""cryptic"" sentences encoded in the authors' proprietory RSA encryption algorithm, and ""core dumped"" information. Can't believe that Prentice Hall would publish such junk."
5,"Sounds like a sports car, but mileage improves","We bought this mostly to increase mileage, which it does by about 1 to 1/2 mpg. I think it mostly works by encouraging us to keep our foot off the gas - the car definitely has more power, but when you punch it, you hear it, so unless we need the acceleration, we just don't punch it anymore. The filter itself is great - easy to clean, much better performance than stock."
1,BUYER BEWARE-DO NOT BUY THIS TOY,"This was my son favorite toy, but the quality is horrible. It tears very easily and it cannot be patched. The toy does not come with enough balls, so you have to buy more. I bought mine from Target and they dont carry it anymore. DO NOT BUY THIS TOY, NOT WORTH THE MONEY."
1,DO NOT BUY ANY OF THE DORA DEIGO BALL PITS,"Poor quality- top hatch ripped off from first use- with in one week the seam blew, not able to be patched. My 18 month old daughter had fun for one week, and cried when we had to throw it out. Waste of money. Very poor quality. Was easy to inflate."
1,Specs are not clear,"The specs says that will work for Dell PA-4, but the specs for the PA-4 are Output 20 volt, 3.5A, and the specs on your descripcion are Output 19V, 3.16A. Wiii it work like the PA-4?"
1,Unable to get support /answers,"I have now tried three times to get a simple answer from the vendor's tech support, and so far no one has responded to my voice mail messages - apparently you can't get through directly!The article received was not as implied by the headline a replacement for various different models, but was in fact a used version of one specific model (pa-3) which has a different output voltage than the one I am seeking to replace, which is a pa-4. So I have called to confirm whether this will create problems or in fact can be used interchangeably, and if not to arrange for the correct unit to be sent instead."
1,Colossal Waste of Time,"I'm not sure how this book wound up on my Recommendations list, but OUCH. I took a chance on it due to the low price and glowing editorial reviews. I read the first few stories and was surprised by the lack of substance and intelligence, but I pressed on, assuming there had to be a few gems further on. No dice. Usually in a book as profane and perverted as this, there are at least a few stories worth reading for their erotic value, but this collection was devoid of even that.I suppose it might appeal to folks who fancy themselves extreme nonconformists -- the stories certainly don't deliver on the the typical reader expectations of plot, character, or interest. I've certainly learned a lesson regarding the editorial reviews on this site -- caveat emptor, and don't believe everything you read."
1,Advanced Users Stay Away,"This rounter ""CallVantage WRT54GP2A-AT"" and the ""Vonage WRT54GP2"" have the same problem that Roger Simon (Orlando, FL) posted I spent about 12 hours between both the Vonage and CallVantage routers. If you leave the factory settings as is then the router works great. When I tried to add my ssh service and change any other parameters that's when the router would become unstable. It kept dropping the internet connection. Soon as i hooked up my old BEFSR41 everything worked great. Bottom line these routers should not be on the market. It is not worthy of one star."
1,Same problem with dropped connections.,"I have a Linksys 802B unit that works perfectly. The CallVantage unit is another matter. I've rebooted the router 3 times in 4 days to get my connection back. The tech guy in INDIA couldn't comprehend what I was trying to get across. He told me to switch channels. Only problem was I told him I was losing the connection at the router on an ethernet connection. Nothing has changed except the router and my wireless phone. It is a 5.8 gig unit with that frequency on the base unit and the handset. Shouldn't be a problem.I changed my SSID,enabled the WEP, and changed my default password. Oh yeah, perish the thought, I forwarded a port.I think I'm sending this back and getting the AT&T; adaptor. I can always get a little 4 port hub and start at the modem and split into the phone before the router, then have a cord go into the router, then out to my computer etc.Waiting to hear from Linksys web tech now. I'm holding my breath.Regards, Owen"
1,Periodic internet connection losses.,"No firmware upgrades yet available as of 3/19/05. The expert that I chatted with on Linksys was a smug loser who asked me questions like, is it plugged in? After answering his ridiculous questions and explaining the same thing 15 times he finally told me that I should get my router replaced...sounds like the wrong advice, since many people have the same problems. I am guessing with a new unit I will have the same issues. Internet connection will drop out periodically. Until they recall it or update the firmware. Will a firmware upgrade fix the issue? Maybe. When will it arrive?? I will probably be taking mine back. Might give AT&T one more attempt to keep me as a customer by calling their help line. But they may go the way of my former Lingo service."
2,Wireless Signal Strength Sucks,"Firstly, let me say that the wired switch portion, and VoIP components of this hub work very well. I have no complaints there, and signup with CallVantage was easy. Configuration is a breeze for those with previous Linksys routers. But the wireless sucks! This replaced a WRT45G which had excellent signal strenght all the time, with a signal of -50 dBm on average; with this router, in the same location as the other one, I get good-very good signal strength at about -70 dBm. Obviously wireless connection speeds suffer as a result of this. I forked out for some high-gain antennas, which was also a waste of money, as the singal strength didn't improve one bit. Also support is terrible - I don't think any of the Linksys techs I spoke to even knew they have VoIP products on the market."
1,"a lot of talk, little to listen to","I saw BJ Ward read at my local bookstore, and found his reading overly theatrical and lacking substance. I checked out this book and found the reason why. BJ Ward wants to think he giving poetry to 'middle class' subjects, perhaps even thinks he's being the poet of the people, but this is on person who was bored to tears with what he has to say."
5,Another Winner from Another Great NJ Poet,"As an aspiring poet myself, I'm proud to be from New Jersey, which has a rich heritage of fine poets, from Walt Whitman to recent Pultizer-Prize winner Paul Muldoon. And there's this guy, who's blown me away every time I've heard him read his works. I've also had the pleasure of taking one of his workshops. BJ Ward writes about life from an everyguy, working-class perpsective, but with a wonderful command of language, humor and pathos. His poems range from near-heartbreaking reminiscences of a hard childhood, to poems of driving, singing along to Roy Orbison or spotting a groundhog beside the highway. These are highly accessible, but expertly crafted works, and I highly recommend this volume as well as his previous one, ""17 Love Poems with No Despair"". If you like Billy Collins, you'll love BJ Ward!"
1,"ditto--Oh, Come On","I agree with the reader from Princeton. My hope is that this book disappears into obscurity, as just another banal attempt at poetry that desires to mean something more than the poet's woes, and it isn't. I don't know who this guy thinks he is, but he isn't much, I can assure you."
5,Nissan Replacement EGR,"After 10 years my factory EGR went bad. I took a chance & replaced it with this one. Compared to the Nissan brand EGR, this one looked better made. This one was half the price of any Nissan brand EGR's that I could find online. After it was installed, the ECU/Service Engine Soon Dash Light was reset & I have had no problems with it at all."
5,Good contemporary poetry--a rare and wonderful thing!,"What a pleasant surprise to find new poetry that is carefully crafted, intelligent, and genuinely moving. If only more poets writing today took their craft as seriously. I hope Mehigan is working on a second book!"
4,"Great Socks, High Price","I have been wearing Thorlo light-weight hikers as my everyday sock for years.They're great socks and wear like iron...My oldest working pair is now 11 years old and just developed it's first hole.They would be perfect if they were cheaper, but I guess $14 for a pair of socks that will last 10 years isn't too bad."
5,Great Socks for work,"These are great socks for work when you need something a bit dressier. I have always been a fan of the light hikers but recently, my co-workers have been joking with me about how my sock and shoes are just not quite right for the office environment. I bought a pair of these in tan and also in black and love the way they feel and now dont have to compromise comfort for looks. Being Thorlos, they will also last a long time"
5,"Great socks, but expensive","These are by far the highest quality Coolmax socks I have owned. That's good, since they are also the most expensive. I will definitely buy more, however, since I think they will last a long time."
3,They're OK,"My feet sweat and I bought these mainly to help with that. They haven't done any better job than my Gold Toes. I'm only giving them 3 stars because they are good quality and very comfortable. However, I wouldn't buy them again because I don't consider them a good value."
3,"Might work for some, but not for me",I can't give it too low of a star rating because I'm just one person. but I bought these specifically because I have sweaty feet. They did absolutely nothing for me in terms of reducing or wicking sweat away. Not at all.
5,Great Game,"My son loves this game, it is funny and keeps him entertained! He has all four of these games and was hoping a 5th. game would come out for Deer Avenger!"
4,"HORROR CLASSIC, yes even the euro cut","first off, i dont know what the hell the guy below me is saying. RESIDENT EVIL the movie SUCKED. it shouldnt even be compared to dawn of the dead. dawn of the dead is one of the greatest zombie films of all time. unlike resident evil, this movie was full of social commentary and not chicks with guns that can do back flips. the only problem with this version is that its basically the same as the US version. Some scenes are edited out or in. anyway, if you are a collector of zombie films and dont have the dawn of the dead boxed set, buy it!"
1,what is this????!!!!,"Isn't this the european version that all original [1978] dawn of the dead fans have heard so much about the all great and edited to shreds argento version? Well by now most dawn fans have the ultimate edition and if you don't your no true fan but anyway and the argento european version of the flick is included in that very great package so why release ""zombi"" seperatley so people can buy ""zombi 2"" and the zombi box set containing the last 3 zombi films and complete their collection of argentos sequels to dotd but in my oppinion just buy zombi 2 the cheap dvd and the zombi collection and don't shell out your mucho dinero for this sad attempt at anchor bays excuse to make filthy lucre. I am a huge fan of argentos ""zombi"" flicks but I already have the dotd ultimate edition. so don't get this if you already have the ultimate edition just get the last few ""zombi"" flicks."
2,Not so good,"I bought this DVD because George A. Romero is a legend in horror movies, and everybody talk me about this film, and they said it was good. I have to say this movies shows the quality of mister Romero's movies, the way he works and how the scripts are. It's like a movie made by a college student, making it as he learns new lessons about movies. The quality of the images and of the sound aren't good (I know are the 70's). The stunts have their faces painted in gray trying to look pale, and black people have them in white, sometimes the film it's like a National Geographic report with a guy in V.O., explaining what zombies are. And the dialogues are irrtating. I think the new version (2004) it's a little better. For a good zombie film watch ""Resident evil""."
5,No regrets,"This was a very entertaining story. Thought provoking also. The main character, Mary, reminded me of some females that I have had relationships with: stubborn, professional, and sexy. The motive of the killer was believable because the author did a fine job of presenting his background in sufficient detail for the reader to understand how a killer came to be. There are some philosophical themes in the book that deal with race, politics, and society but they all are relevant to the plot. I appreciate that the author did not preach. I'm going to stay on the lookout for this author's next book because his first one was a fine effort."
3,Not A Bad First Effort,"I gave this book three stars out of five because, for me, it fell in the ""not great but not bad"" category. I personally could not get into Mary's character. She bothered me from the beginning until near the end and I also did not feel that Eugene's character was developed enough for me to understand why he was killing people. Yes, I could tell he was ""crazy"" but was it only from the ""Parson Curse"" that they referred to in the book a few times? I also did not care for the fact that Mary was practically handed the killer at the end. She had some evidence but not really enough to put him away so the ending made me feel like she was not the greatest investigator and the killer came off as being stupid. Not a bad first effort, but the plot had some holes that I could not ignore."
5,boyz in the 'burbs,"As a resident of a Detroit suburb, I was very attentive as to how Sterling Anthony portrayed the relationship between Detroit and its suburbs. He was on the money about how every political issue gets a racial spin. None the less, he was fair and honest not to make white people the stereotypical scapegoats. But all of that has to do with the backdrop of the story. The story, itself, was sensational. A sterling effort (sorry, couldn't resist the pun)."
2,"Not Very Lively, Especially for a Thriller","This book should be riveting, based on its premise. Instead, it is clunky and trite. The story isn't so much a reversal of a common theme as a parading of all the usual cliches, done in a slightly different manner. The characters are almost all unappealing or uninteresting, and Mary should have been drawn better. The book is fairly easy to read, but the author's skill is merely adequate, not up to the level of most thriller-writers, let alone Michael Connelly. Read The Poet if you want a story of psychological suspense. Most authors do it better than Sterling, so wait for him to develop into a writer before you spend money on one of his books."
3,My interest has been piqued,"After reading all the previous reviews (those posted here and those offered by the so-called literary authorities), I've decided to give Mr. Anthony's work a try. After reading the first two chapters, I credit him with doing a solid job of setting up the plot and then giving his readers a believable account of what some African-American/female law enforcement officers--specifically, Detective Mary Cunningham--may at times go through while on the job (or off, for that matter).So far, so good."
5,Riveting,"It hard to believe this is the first piece written by Anthony Sterling. The author provides a masterful delivery of character development. The story is tight, the characters are 3 dimentional, and the writing is well structured. Every chapter adds to the suspense and never gets predictable. For those that like suspense thrillers, this is it. I look forward to the movie with Angela Bassett as the protagonist detective, Mary Cunningham."
2,So NOT the REAL deal.,"This is the first of Fern Michaels I've read and I just could not take this book seriously. first of all the whole so called scam in the white house was so ridiculously far-fetched and the dialogues were so jumbled that you could literally forget how it actually started especially when the first lady rambled on and on. the characters of agent Star and Wilson were so not of women aged 40 and who have such serious top-notch jobs, they were so immature. but im willing to try more of her books...lets see."
3,Easy read,"Good book. Enjoyed. Great for a weekend love story. Predictable, but still interesting. Young adults and women would like this book."
3,A cosy read,"There was something about this novel which got me in, but once I was there I'm not sure if it was the little old ladies, the agents - Quinn and Sadie - or the ex-lover, Ezra. The story line was feasible probably a few years ago, but I doubt it would have worked in this day and age. Swapping a look-alike for the real deal and trying to convince the First Lady, who has been married for 40 years, was never going to work! I liked the story, liked the characters and finished the book overnight."
5,Real Deal,"I thoroughly enjoyed it and would recommend it to all! Haven't read a Fern Michaels book that I haven't enjoyed - Loved the Sisterhood Series, can't wait for another one!"
2,Silly,"I was really disappointed in this book. It was not the usual good writing that I know Fern Michaels is capable of. It was about the silliest book I've read in a long time. The first lady came across as flighty and eccentric and the ""real"" president wasn't much better.My suggestion is to pass this one up and seek another one of Fern Michaels."
1,Withholding Opinion,I've just started this book but am having a hard time taking it seriously. It is hard to visualize FBI or Secret Service agents behaving like these have so far. When did men need anything more than their underwear to sleep in? to need to wear a woman's nightgown? Give me a break!. And what's with the dog running the show? One can be a canine enthusiast without having them running the house where ever and when ever they go. It will have to get better before I can give it more stars. I have read several of Fern Michael's books or I probably would not have picked out this one.
3,not suitable for webb cam,"It's a beautiful design, attractive fashion styling digital camera that my cousin gave me last month.Resolution VGA 640x480 pixel with USB port (no serial port) will made you think this camera also can be used for a webb cam, but the focus range (90 cm to infinity) made this camera not suitable for a webb cam. The 8 MB built in memory is the luxurius thing that makes me sure this camera is cheap."
1,Wasted my money,I bought the ViviCam 20 and cannot use on my computer with Microsoft Windows XP. They tell me it could damage my computer now or in the future if I use it.
1,Horrible,"I have had this camera for three years and have never had a picture worth printing. The pictures are always blurring, they are ruined by lighting from the outside. The photos are terrible!! Don't buy this camera. I am online now to find a new camera. This one was a waste of my money!!!"
1,Hate It,"We have had this camera for a year and have yet to get it to work...even after calling tech support. Finally, after reading the reviews on this site I see that the problem is probably that we're running Windows XP.Even if we could work around the software problem, the camera will not turn on any more...even after changing out the batteries.Complete waste of money!"
3,Fun to build and quick fun to launch,"Main issue: Product description says it comes without engines, so I purchased the extra engines pack. It actually DOES comes with two engines."
1,Don't Believe What You See,"I am continuously looking for bargains on clothes since I need large sizes and there isn't much of a choice where I live. The shirt ordered seems to be what I want and I ordered one to test it out. Right size, right material, reasonable price. I haven't even received this shirt so I can't say anything about it, but what bugs me is the shipping cost. The shirt listed at $11.69 and shipping is advertised on the web page for $4.35. Sounds good, I'll try it. Bang! The Final Charge is 11.69 for the shirt (ok), AND $12.78 for shipping! Whaaaat? You got me once. Do you think I'll order from you again?"
1,Make Sure You Want to Eat This Way Forever!,"I know two people who swore by this diet. They did, indeed, lose a lot of weight. They looked great! However, each has ""fallen off the wagon"" periodically and, as soon as they eat just a little bit of carbohydrates (compared to normal eaters), they BALLOON over their original weights. They lose the weight once they return to this diet, but not as much as they did originally. They are both terrified of going off this diet, but, clearly, it's not working anymore.I have come to believe that this is a yo-yo diet that can cause metabolic slowing. Based on the long-term efforts I've witnessed firsthand, I would recommend you follow this diet only if you are absolutely positive you will adhere to it for the rest of your life. Otherwise, you can end up BIGGER than you were before you began the diet. You've been warned!!!!"
3,Carb Addicts It makes sense,"As a carb addict it made perfect sense to me. The authors explained the theory of insulin peaks and troughs leading to carb addiction. There are different plans to follow, starting with ""entry"" level and then 4 other levels depending on how much weight you lose. Basically eat carbs once a day. I would recommend this book to any carb addict."
5,It just seems TOO easy...,"I am nearing the end of 3 months on this diet, and I am 30 pounds down. How MANY times have I tried to diet before? Two kids and 50 pounds over my lightest weight, I've lost count, but I know I have failed everytime.With this diet, I can STILL have my full strength soda at my reward meal, and actually eat that meal with my family and not feel deprived and short-changed. No ""one cracker"" crazy meals. No awful ""pre-packaged"" meals. Just REAL food.It took 3 months, but my results convinced my husband to join me. He is down 12 pounds in his first month. He laughs and calls it ""magic"" how every 2nd or 3rd day, when he wakes up in the morning, the scale moves down another pound.""Thank you"" does not seem enough, but that is all I can give the Heller's.Thank you."
3,PLEASE talk with your doctor before trying this plan!,"I used this diet, and had great results at first -- but in time, it stopped working. Eventually, even the strictest form of the plan had me gaining weight. My doctor told me that she could have saved me alot of trouble because this diet eventually backfires for many of it's users -- so talk with your doctor before trying this. And good luck!"
2,Natural diet-?,"Though I'm not overweight by other people's standards, I tried this diet out of greed (for lack of a better word). It worked for a few weeks- starts are always promising but then trying to control my appetite for carbs until dinner, feeling like I was limited caused me to binge on carbs and my reward meal ended up being one huge dessert. I may have been addicted to carbs but this diet made me be obsessed with them. I got a eating disorder of sorts out of it too. I think Suzanne Somers and Montignac is much smarter and healthier."
4,I love this diet!,"This book/diet is very good and I'm not craving sweets anymore. After taking the ""test"" I knew why I'd had so many problems with other diets (WW, Slimfast, etc.,) I really like the Reward meal as it allows me to eat with my family. By preparing more balanced meals, I can eat with them and still be on the diet. The main problem for me is ....I've been on the diet for almost 2 weeks and haven't lost one pound. So, if anyone out there has any ideas, please let me know..."
4,I've reached a stopping point.,"I've been on this diet for two and a half months now, and I've reached a stopping point. I lost ten pounds in the first month and now I've plateaued. I've been following the guidelines strictly, but am getting discouraged with the results. I'd love to get feedback from anyone else who has been through this diet and had similar experiences. Fell free to e-mail me. Until I learn otherwise, though, I am sticking to the diet. At least those ten pounds aren't coming back!"
2,ok for a while but not for life!,"This diet is ok but it could have been better . If you stick to a lean protein and replace the saturated fat with low glycemic carbs , you might live longer though . Also , if you don't do weight training , you just go from a big pear/apple to a little pear/apple . This book has its merits but the best is Body For Life by Bill Philips ; someone who definatly talks the talk and walks the walk !"
1,This diet is NOT for everyone-even if you are a carb addict!,"I thought I had found it! Most of the book made sense and when I took the test I found out I am a severe carbohydrate addict. I knew that, if this diet worked, it was a diet I could live with forever! That was the downfall though - IF the diet worked. I did it for a week straight and did not even consider cheating. I not only did not lose any weight but I GAINED weight. Only a half of pound but still I was DEVESTATED! I wanted this diet to work so badly. I am debating whether or not to give it one more week to work before giving up. I would definitely recommend trying it. I mean there are far more positive reviews than negative ones. Just don't get your hopes up...for me it was too good to be true."
5,Lost e-mail diet partner,"I just lost my carb-diet e-mail partner's address. Kathy if you see this, e-mail me again so I can save your e-mail address properly. Together we can lose lots of pounds & inches!!!"
4,Great plan so far...,"I have been on this ""eating plan"" now for a week. I have already lost 5 pounds. I am so excited because I have been gaining and gaining for several years, and no other diet has had any positive effect. It is a great alternative to the Atkins, which did not work for me. (Much too tiring, restrictive and possibly unhealthy over the long term). I think that if you are consistant in your complementary meals (NO-carbs), then eat a ""sensible"" reward meal, it will work. I do agree tho that the book is somewhat confusing and even may be contradictory in areas. Some areas say No snacking, yet other meal plans include a snack. Also has some repetitiveness that could be eliminated. I am not too excited about the recipes enclosed in it; I think they could have done a little better job with the choices. But overall I think the plan is a 5 star, I just rated it 4 mainly because of the way the book was written. ...GOOD LUCK...."
4,Adkins Alternative,"The nice thing about this diet is that it, while still being effective, allows you to eat a normal meal each day. It's much easier than the Adkins diet though perhaps it takes a little longer to reach your goal. It is certainly easier to keep up for life and probably healthier as it lets you have more carbs than others."
5,Read this book after every other diet plan has failed you!!!,"I was completely miserable one day, having tried every single diet plan in the world. I came upon this book and it was like a godsend. Once you understand the basics of this plan, you will realize that you can eat everything in the world, lose weight, maintain it, and stick with it forever. I am now back into a size 8 (loose sometimes!) and am happier and more energetic than ever. This book teaches you that being addicted to carbs is NOT YOUR FAULT and it teaches you how to break the cycle. Trust me, I'm a complete carb addict and always will be. But the difference is now, after having been on the plan for almost a year, I can walk down the cookie aisle and not be tempted. And if I am tempted, I can eat cookies at my reward meal and be satisfied with a normal serving size. The plan teaches you that you CAN eat like a ""normal"" person. Never thought I'd be able to do that, ever!!!"
4,A Great Start,"After reading this book, I am off to a great start of a thinner life. I have lost 10 pounds in three weeks, and I am no longer hungry! I have read the new books by Drs. Heller, and I have made the changes to this original diet, but this book is a wonderful way to start your new low carb life!"
2,"May work for some, but I couldn't stick w/ it and gained","I would like to say that I did lose weight at first. I took off 18 pounds in three months...BUT...I then could not lose more and got right back to eating like I was...gained the 18 pounds and another 20! Now I am 50# overweight. I felt hungery on the diet and deprived. So I really ""made up"" for what I didn't eat. Also... I can only eat so many bacon and egg breakfasts. The book was well written and easy to follow. It could work for those folks who can stick with it!"
2,"If you love carbs, you'll hate this book!","I also tried the Atkin's diet and thought this might be different. However, trying to be on this diet -- on, off, on, off, I gained a total of 20 pounds. I can tolerate only so much in the way of eggs, and fat, and ended going on and off in big ways. My cravings for carbs increased, and I would binge for several days, then try again. IF you can stay on the diet, it will work, but a realistic lifetime eating program? NO WAY! Be careful for the high protein low carb diets! I truly believe it does something to your fat burning capabilities and sets you up for weight GAIN if your carb intake goes over the limit. Consistently over the limit with a super sensitive to carbs metabolism and here comes the weight. Like I said, over a period of 6 months, I gained 20 pounds! Watch out!"
3,Great for Meat Lovers,"I had not watched the Oprah show on which this diet was featured, but saw this book and thought that the diet sounded great. Unfortunately, I overlooked the fact that I am not crazy about meat or eggs. I found myself eating my reward meals at a vegetarian restaurant after gagging down fats, meats and eggs all day. I got very nauseated after several days and stopped the diet. If you like meat and eggs, this diet would be a dream come true! Eat foods you like all day and then have a reward meal with everything you like at supper. If you aren't a meat-lover, though, it is useless."
3,good book but....,some of what is said in this book conflicts with what these authors said on the oprah winfrey show.
2,Seems dangerous to me!,"When I began using this diet, it didn't seem too hard to follow and I really loved the idea of the reward meal but it caused me to develop dumping syndrome (sudden diarrhea after eating), which took a while to clear up. Also, this diet seems like it would be dangerous for diabetics. It has been a while since I read the book, maybe they address that topic."
2,A passing fad!,"I tested to be a severe carbo addict and tried the diet for four days. Eating only meat and select vegtables made me feel light headed and sick. I could easily lose weight on this diet because the more I got into it the less I wanted to eat ONLY because it made me nausiated to think of eating some of the foods. My sweet tooth INCREASED because all you are allowed to eat are salty foods. What makes most people succesful on this diet is the fact they are consuming less and eating more veggies. Everyone is looking for the fast and easy way out -- there is none! Since most fat people like me have low self-esteem and little will-power, I'm afraid this too shall pass!"
3,Helped me make my decision,"This was a very good book. I had bought it along with Dr. Atkins book and read them both to see which one I wanted to go with. After careful reading and research, I felt Dr. Atkins had a better diet."
4,SO FAR SO GOOD...,"I'm going into my 18th day and I'm losing weight at a great pace. I started at 180 pounds and now I weigh 170. I'm 5'8"" and now one I've ever met thinks I weigh more then 140 pounds. This has made it hard to stay motivated because my boyfriend, a guy teacher thinks I look great the way I am, and I want to lose 15 more pounds! Anyway, why I'm writing is tell people that as of yet I have been living a ""normal"" day once a weekend, and I have had weddings up the wazoo and have been drinking wine and coolers and eating what I want for as long as I want and I'm still losing! I follow the diet very strictly for 6 of 7 days and It's really working!"
5,ABSOLUTELY FABULOUSLY SUCCESSFUL,"I AM CHEATING HERE -- I AM AN ADULT WHO HAS FOLLOWED THIS DIET FOR THE PAST 7 1/2 YEARS AND MAINTAINED AN 80 POUND WEIGHT LOSS AND 2 YEARS AGO WAS DOING SO WELL, GOD MADE A WAY FOR ME TO BE REMOVED FROM MY BLOOD PRESSURE MEDICINE.THIS DIET WORKS, AND MAY GOD BLESS THE HELLERS!"
1,Not for me!,"I got on this diet seven weeks ago and as of today, I've had it. I lost five lbs in the first week and for the next six weeks not a pound! I got depressed when there was no change in my weight for weeks, but always went back to the pages where they tell you to be patient, the weight will start going down if you just stick to the plan. And that is what I did, but nothing happened.I followed the plan strictly, even went to the plan D where you skip one of your complimentary meals. I was constantly hungry, but stuck with the plan D for three weeks since I thought my weight would actually start going down.But as I said, I've had it. I'll just get on a low fat diet that makes more sense to me than this one.I'm happy for everybody who had results with this diet, but like they said in the book""This doesn't work for everybody"". Whether you're an addict or not,I may add."
2,OK if you have time to cook everything from scratch,"I was excited to get this book, but even the bread is made from scratch...I was hoping for something more practical."
4,Results with Chromium GTF,"I'm just wondering if anyone has tried using the Chromium GTF, that the Hellers also suggested to use? I started using it about a month ago and have noticed pleasing results WITHOUT being on the diet.....I had to go off of it for awhile due to some major surgery, but the Chromium seems to be doing the trick, slowly but surely with a lot of patience."
2,The Carbohydrate Addict's Diet,I found the book to be not helpful at all when learning how to eat a balanced and healthy diet. To see the authors on Oprah even confirmed my suspicions that this is a FAD.
3,Carbo Addict review,"This is an interesting book, for those of us who buy and borrow diet books. I am pretty sure I could be a chapter of this book! I wish they would do an update of this book as it was published years ago and I am pretty sure a lot of things are out of date since they did their research. I'm not sure it would be an easy diet to follow but if you are addicted to carbs I think it sure is worth trying. What have you got to lose? If this works so well and has been around for years, why haven't we heard about this diet lately?"
5,Amazing explanation & resolution of why I have carb cravings,"No more carb lunches and ravenous cravings at 3:00PM for me. Too many carbs & too many pounds go hand-in-hand but no longer for me. I am thinner, happier than I have ever been! Best money spent was buying this book. Thanks!"
4,Need help to understand portions of food that we can eat.,"During a reward meal is there anything that we should know about before we start the hour meal. Like how many calories, carbs, sugars etc, we can have (or) as we understand it is ,that we can eat as much food as we want at one sitting. Can we just sit and graze till we are full. We(my husband and myself) have been following this program for 17 days now and have not lost one pound. The weight stays the same, and we are very discouraged. Please can anyone help and clarify the portions of food we can have at the reward mesl. Also, if Drs Heller have an e-mail address that we can write to please let us know so that we can get first hand information from them. Thanks"
4,"Good, Healthy Diet","After reading through several of the disgruntled reviewers there are a few topics I would like to address. First of all the book is an advocate of exercise, but states that you do not have to exercise to be successful on this diet. Secondly the book is not a high protein, low carb diet. It does endorse limiting your carbs during two meals. It also advocates checking with your doctor before beginning this program as well as eating low fat foods and meeting all dietary regulations. This diet was designed for vegetarians as well as meat lovers, and is meant to improve ones health. If you review the receipes in the book you will see how healthy your meals can be."
2,Don't Buy This Book If You're Athletic,"If you're like me, this might not be the weight-loss program for you. I'm a woman who does at least a good hour of exercise 4-5 times per week. I'm pretty muscular but would like to lose maybe 5 lbs of fat.Two problems with this book FOR SOMEONE LIKE ME: 1) it's really focussed on people who are at least 15 lbs. overweight, and 2) the kind of carb-cutting it requires just isn't enough energy if you're more than moderately active. Just keep it in mind if you're already active, or if you want to do a weight-loss plan that involves upping your exercise."
4,It works!,"This book is no work of literature, but it is THE ANSWER to my weight problems. I never would have believed it before I tried it. I've lost 20 pounds COMFORTABLY, and now consider the plan to be my permanent way of eating."
4,Great book and diet that works!,"I began this diet about 2 weeks ago and have already lost 7 lbs. I am never hungry and feel really good. I never thought that losing weight could be so fun, easy, and the beginning of a new way of eating healthy."
5,This book has been for me as if I have come home.,I started the program in May 1998. I have lost 77lbs and have another 65 to go. This program works exceedingly well with my metabolism. The energy that I have and the satisfaction that I feel keeps me faithful to the goal that I have set. The stories of other addicts have given me the strength to keep going. Therefore I continue to reread the book as an encouragemnet to me. I encourage you to continue and not to lose hope in your goals.
2,Eh...it's okay,"The whole concept of the ""reward meal"" is kind of a tease. You anxiously await your reward meal, as visions of pizza and cookies dance in your head. However, after a full day of eating very little, your stomach is going to shrink. I know mine did. So, you race home, light-headed & starving, and begin shoving in the food as fast as you can before your ""hour"" is up. Only a few bites into your lasagna (or pizza, burgers, etc) you're stuffed. You have to wait 15-20 minutes to digest. But, guess what? The clock is ticking, and you still want to get that precious chocolate cake in.It's hard to enjoy your reward meal, because you can't take the time to really savor it. Generally, people eat dinner, wait awhile, then have dessert. You need a little time to let the food settle. An hour isn't enough time. Just my 2 cents..."
1,"Starved, Stuffed and Cranky","I was very disappointed with this plan from day one. First of all, I was so hungry by the end of the first day that I could not enjoy my Reward Meal: I had developed a horrendous headache for the lack of nourishment. Then the logic kicked in. I realized that I was doing just fine with my exercise routine and by not eating anything after 6pm. Hey, if it ain't broke, why fix it? It might work for some, but not for me. Good luck."
1,Starving by dinner time,"I've only been on this diet for two weeks, but I haven't noticed any signifigant weight loss. The problem with this diet is that during the day I feel light-headed and, as a student, have trouble with my memory. By dinner time, my reward meal, I am starving. For example, I can wolf down a bowl of pasta, a bowl of cereal, a huge bagel, and a peanut butter sandwich within an hour and still feel hungry. I hardly see how consuming over a thousand calories in an hour is going to benefit me. I know carbohydrates are the reason I'm overweight (seeing as how I eat under 1,500 calories a day and jog 5 miles without losing a pound), but it seems as if a fine balance between them and protein is the way to go."
3,Very Good but somewhat confusing!!,"After seeing them on oprah I had to try it. After one week I have lost 2 pounds. I feel great and i'm not moody. But the book I have states soda is ok if it has no carbs/ then I ""hear"" no diet soda is allowed. Can I have sugar subsitute in my coffe in the morning? Should I read all the books. Help. I have a ""Killer"" dress to wear to my Mary Kay Siminar next August, this lifestyle change is the way but I want to do it right from the begining."
2,Talk to your doctor first please,"Tried the diet for two weeks and promptly threw up every day for two weeks. Taking carbs out of my diet triggered my hypoglycemia. Also, was very tired and sluggish. Talked to my doctor and she IMMEDIATELY took me off the diet (I was losing weight however). Turns out a low no carb diet has been causing kidney failure and 75% of all who lose weight on the diet gain it back. Again, this is a diet industry opportunity to make money. Seems to work better for men....please talk to your doctor before going on this diet."
2,Carbohydrate Addict's Diet,"Well, I'm sad to say that this book didn't work for me. I had such high hopes that it would. When I read about this book, I thought, ""They're talking about me!"" I really believed that I'm a carb addict and I was sure that this book would help me break the carb cycle and to lose those stubborn 10 pounds. Unfortunately, it didn't. I may have lost a pound or two, but nothing significant. I did really well during the day, but by the time I got to my Reward Meal, I had a hard time controlling my portions. I seem to do better if I count calories, because I think very hard before I put ANY food in my mouth. Since I didn't have to count with this plan, I know I ate too much at the Reward Meal. Plus, there's only so much protein that a person can handle! I'm a picky eater, which really limited my choices-it seemed like I was eating the same foods over and over. I stuck with it for one month, then called it quits."
3,Try Sugarbusters instead!,"I read this book, Dr Atkins'book and a book called SugarBusters. I didn't agree with the reward meal, not because I loved the idea of gorging for an hour but that is exactly what I'm trying to prevent. I also believe God gave us fruit for a reason and wanted to somehow fit it into my day. So sugarbusters seems to be the answer for me. I will update you!"
2,Can't Eat This Way The Rest Of My Life,"I got very tired of bacon and eggs for breakfast. For one thing, I never ate bacon before so why would I eat it on a diet. This eating plan does not seem to be a plan for changing the way you eat. It only helps to get weight off fast. I lost 5 pounds in about 4 days.I can't imagine eating this way for the rest of my life though. I do have to say that I did feel better, I lost that tiredness that I'm sure all Carb addicts know about. You know the one where you start to yawn during lunch. Anyway, I'm happy for anyone that this diet helps but I don't think it is for me because I am trying to change the way I eat to a healthier way."
3,It's a great plan,"I know myself that I am a carb junkie. I could eat a 5lb bag of potatoes in one sitting and I felt so huge. I started this today and I hope I can keep mself under control. And the american food pyramid tells you to have 11 servings a day of carbs. Who were they making it for a human or a cow? And the reward meal is the greatest thing I ever heard of. No need to avoid, just save it for later.Look out Larry North you have a lot of competition, and this plan works so much better.I saw the entire thing on Oprah just last week and in my opinion why buy the book when the hellers are on tv giving the secrets away."
3,HELP I'M NEW TO THIS!,"I started this diet 5 days ago and I have a hard time with breakfasts, and drinking only water(I love diet coke) all day. I have an active life which includes alot of parties. Does this mean that I can never drink cocktails outside the 60 min mark again? That's depressing to me is it to anyone else? Or is there something that I'm not understanding about this diet? Anyone else having trouble with the 'bread' recipes? Please if anyone can help me I'd love some answers. Please e-mail me :("
4,I'm never hungry,Can anyone tell me if it is alright not to have a reward meal and not eating any carbs will speed up the weight loss process?
1,Go with the Carbohydrate Addict's Lifespan Program,"This is a wonderful concept, and one I believe I shall be eternally thankful to Drs. Heller (and Oprah) for bringing into my life. Don't waste time with this book however: If you are interested in this eating plan read the Carbohydrate Addict's Lifespan Program book instead. The Yo-Yo book predates the larger trade book and if you are reading both together, you may get confused and not get the full effect of this eating system. Many reward meal personal ""stories"" in this book for example are misleading because they are not balanced, and balance is the important concept stressed in the larger, later book. I saw another reviewer noted the ""binge"" aspect this diet's reward meal seems to promote: Again, the Yo-Yo book confused me. Better clarification is provided in the other, later Lifespan Program book."
4,The difference between cravings and hunger,"I have craved carbs for 36 years, since I was 12 and started eating to cover up my feelings. This book has helped me overcome my fear of hunger, because hunger is easy to handle-- the cravings are not. By eating carbs once a day, I feel hunger sometimes the rest of the day, but I can hold on for an hour or two until my next meal. I could never control a craving -- I had to eat, and beat myself up everyday for being ""weak"" and not losing the 30 pounds I gained when I quit smoking. I think this diet is a solution to my problem, and I'm very grateful."
2,Not for me,"This diet might work for some, but I don't think that having a large carb full dinner helps those people who have a true sugar addiction."
1,This book would make a good infomercial,"The book lacks sufficient scientific evidence for its dieting strategy. However, there are more irritating testimomonials in this book than you would find on even the most tasteless infomercial. The book would make a great marketing case study since it avails the reader to identiy with at least one of the profiles presented in the testimonials. I tried the diet, lost weight (about 5 lbs) and then stopped - eventually gained it back. It is interesting to notet that this book follows basically the same premiss for weight gain (carb addiciton)as several other weight loss books, but htey all come to slightly different conclusions. If this works for you - great, otherwise you need not make it gospel."
5,"Not a diet,a new way of life!","I tried Dr.Atkins diet and I lost some weight but I found it too restrictive.On this plan I never feel hungry or deprived because you can eat almost anything you want for dinner.I can have pasta,bread,rice ect.,these are all foods I love and on this plan you don't have to give them up.I never knew why after a big meal I would still be hungry.I would have dessert and had trouble stopping at one or two cookies.This diet has taken away my cravings.I have lost almost 20 pounds in 6 weeks.For me it works,I was a carbohydrate addict.Give this diet a try to find out if you are too. You will be amazed at how easy this plan is to follow."
5,I love this diet,"I love this diet! I have been following this plan for about 6 weeks now and have lost 15 lbs. and it's so easy! one thing that I would suggest to anyone contemplating this is to make sure that you eat plenty of fresh veggies- for the fiber. My weight loss also remains more consistent when I eat lots of veggies. I have been at least 20 lbs.(usually more) overweight my entire adult life and this is the first time I've lost weight so easily, so effortlessly. It's easy to stick to a diet where nothing is forbidden. I feel that I've finally found a way of eating that is right for me. Thank you Drs. Heller!"
3,This one was actually...,"descent. I was way disapointed in the first four books in the series. I am hooked on ""True Blood"" (the HBO series thats based on the books), and I've been giving two stars, but this one deserves a slightly higher rating. Sookie is growing up and not whining as much and I have to say that I love, love, love Eric, he's what keeps me reading!"
3,Not the best one in the series,"I loved the previous books in the series, but I don't think this one measures up to the rest. First, I think the subplot with Charles Twining was kind of silly and unnecessary (and confusing). Second, I am getting tired of Sookie hopping from one guy to the next -- first it's Bill, then Eric, then Sam, then Alcide. My head is spinning. I was disappointed that Harris made Alcide kind of a wimpy jerk in this book, because I really liked him in the last book. Also, how long will Bill have to grovel for Sookie's forgiveness? Yes, he was unfaithful, but he has explained why he had to go back to his former lover. It's obvious that Sookie and Bill should be together, so just let her forgive him and move on with it!"
4,Chills and thrills,"I thought I'd heard of all the ""good"" mystery series with female protagonists... but somehow, this one slipped by me! I was more than pleasantly surprised by this book, #5 in Harris' ""Vampire"" mystery series about Sookie Stackhouse, a ""gifted"" waitress with a penchant for danger and deadly (or should I say, dead) men.Gothic appeal aside, this book was full of interesting characters, inventive plot twists, and out-of-the-ordinary occurrences -- including an Elvis sighting. I love an author who creates a world and pulls the reader into it completely, and Harris does that here. The only complaint I have is that Sookie had a few too many love interests -- including a werewolf, a werepanther, a ""shifter,"" and a few vampires. That's quite a few, even for a paranormal chick."
1,"see sookie kiss -- sam, bill, erik, alcide, calvin...","I've read all the books in this series, and have found all of them a fun read. Dead as a Doornail unfortunately is the exception. There is no storyline, no mystery, no excitement.In the very beginning of the book we discover three shifters have been shot, and then we pretty much spend the rest of the book following Sookie around as the men of her little part of Louisiana declare their love or lust for her. No mystery solving. No feeling of danger. Really nothing at all.If you enjoy romance novels maybe you'll find this enjoyable, but if you are looking for another Sookie adventure then definitely skip this installment of the series."
3,left a little to be desired,"this seems to be the ""empire strikes back"" of the southern vamp series. I felt like I was reading it just to get through the story & on to the next. Has Charlaine Harris lost the magic? I'll read the next book before I decide.Of course, I am not as fond of the shifters & their storylines as I am the vamps, so that could have something to do with me not enjoying this as much."
4,didn't see that coming..,sure didn't expect jason to be a were panther.. this book was pretty good as well fast paced & you learn more about hotshot :)
5,Dead as a Doornail,"Fifth book in the Sookie Stackhouse series. I love this series and this book was a great installment. It had it all--the vamps (Eric and Bill), the Weres (Alcide), the Shifters (Sam, Calvin and the new one, Quinn) and Sookie continues to get herself in some sticky situations. This series is pure fun. Sookie's romantic options are plentiful, though I'm rooting for Eric. I bought this book at a library book sale."
3,True Blood,"I knew that I was buying a used book, but I still didn't love the musty smoke smell. Although, it was a great read."
3,Likely OK but ...,"I purchased and avidly read volumes 1 - 4. Then I was able to find 8 - 11 at the library.8, 9, 10 were great. But 11 was so poorly written (as if author had handed off writing to a teenage ghost writer) that I found when returning to read 5 I have just lost interest. This is probably a decent book, but the series ending is so lame that it spoils the previous plot build up for me."
4,Dead As A Doornail,"This book is a good book in the series. I am now waiting on the next book to hit the stores. I like this series because it is funny and the story is still unfolding. Once I read a book in this series, it just makes me impatient for the next book!"
4,Good Unabridged Audio CD-- Well Worth a Listen.,"For me, audio CDs have ebooks beat all hollow. The only thing is that MP3 players are not so ubiquitous that books are routinely offered in that format. In this case for stance you either have to download the book in Audible.com's propietary format or juggle a box of 8 CD's.Johanna Parker is not a bad narrator but I prefer Christine Marshall who narrated an earlier novel by Harris. The narration, nonetheless, is smooth with good production values.If I had my druthers, I would rather Harris backed off a bit on Sookie's love life-- her sensual assessment of every man who gets near her starts to pall after a while-- I would also like her to tighten up the mystery a bit. The mystery took second place to all the supernatural high jinx and the book was not the better for it."
5,"Vamps, Mystery and Sex!","Supernaturals, Murder Mystery and sexual tension... Need I say more! In the midst of causing more trouble Jason finally grows up! Another great story by Charline Harris!"
2,Chinese Food Book,Poorly written and barely coherent. Full of plot holes. The main character can't decide if she is sexy or a prude. Her ESP only works when it's convenient as a plot point. Lots of people do stupid things. I've already forgotten what this book was about.
2,Left me high and dry,This is my least favorite installment so far out of 1-5 that i've read. I don't like how Eric and Bill took a back seat in this book (come back!). There was practically zero romance (for lack of a better word). The story line was all about finding out the sniper shooter and more development of the Weres (snooze). The ending was surprising though. Random but still surprising. Hopefully the next installment will be better.
5,Great Series!,I love the southern vampire mysteries. Charlaine Harris has created a wonderful cast of characters.
4,"enjoyable as always, but......","if you are interested in reading book 5 in this series than you're a fan and I can leave out a synopsis of the series. I just finished book four, which I felt was the best so far (I'm a Sookie/Eric fan) and I was excited to read the next book. Overall the story was very good, but not great. This particular story seemed more like a zig zagging grouping of side stories than one continuous thread.Also, there not enough sexual tension between Sookie and any one particular male character, in fact yet more male creatures ""hot for Sookie"" have been introduced, which is getting a bit ""odd"". Though my husband, who's read all the books already say's their a method to their madness so I'm willing to overlook that.But, all in all, even a ""so-so"" Sookie Stackhouse mystery is better than most other paranormal mysteries, so I'd still suggest it for other Sookie fans.4 stars."
4,Entertaining,"I became hooked on the Southern Vampire series the moment I picked up the first book. This book was good. I would go so far as to say it was great, but it was not fabulous. I've come to expect fabulous from this author. Not enough appearances by our favorite vampires. I felt as though I had missed reading a book in the series."
5,Sookie Sizzles,"It's hard to believe that this is the 5th in the series, because everything in this book seems so fresh and original that you'll swear you've never read anything like it before. The world that Charlaine Harris has created continues to intrigue and mystify the reader, and the humor and sexual chemistry that run rampant throughout this book make for a terrific combination that will have you, like I did, trying to read at every opportunity (including red stoplights...and some green ones as well).An excellent book, and highly recommended."
4,Good but not her best,"I enjoyed this novel but it wasn't the best in the series. There are many stories going on and Sookie's love life is up for grabs. This book is setting up different serarios for the future. Bill, Eric, Alcide, Norris, Sam and a new man/were all make apperances and confuse the hell out of Sookie. It seems as if they are all potential suitors but the reader gets to know them all a bit better and as far as I am concerned they all have to many flaws for Sookie(except Sam( not my favorite) and the new guy Quinn(we don't know about him yet)).I think this book sets things up for the future and let's face it, we all want her to have romantic situations with all of them but she isn't a slut (like Anita). Sookie needs to pick and choose. If you read this series you have to read this book, to many things happen. Overall it's a good read."
3,3.5 stars - Sookie is always fun!,"For those of us who enjoy paranormals, this is such a fun series. There was less of a mystery in this book, or perhaps it was that there was more of a focus on Sookie and the ""men"" around her. I just hope she doesn't go the way of Laurell Hamilton. But all the characters are interesting and the idea of Sookie's world is intriguing. It's not the best in the series, but still a very enjoyable read."
1,Disappointed,"I love the Southern Vampire Series, and was so excited as I waited for this latest to be released.I read it in 2 days and was so let down I wanted to cry!!!! What happened????????? By far, the worst book in the series. No substance, no fun, no adventure.Save your money on this one. If you must read it, wait for the paperback. I hope and pray the next one will be better, and will redeem this otherwise fun series."
3,mixed review,"First up, this is the first book by Charlaine Harris that i have read, so maybe reading them outor order is the reason I'm not thrilled with it. For the most part, i liked it. The whole, supernatural world is well done and well written. In fact, I enjoyed most of the story line quite a bit.The big problem I have with it is that all of these supernatural men seem to have fallen in love with the lead character. Since that isn't what the story was about, it just became an increasingly annoying group of sidestories that kept making me detach from the story.I like a story that I get so involved with that I feel as if i am there, and all of these supernatural, beautiful, powerful men falling all over our heroine made the story unbelivable (and that's saying a lot when the story is about vampires and shapeshifters). Too many times, I was forced back into reality in the middle of a storyline because of this. I really wanted to love these books, but now I don't know that I will read another one."
5,aw,"I love vampire stories. I am hooked on sookie. I want to vist bon temp. I would like to stop by and see Sam at Merlotts.Another good Vampire book is one i read this week called ""Mississippi Vampires"" by Vicky Renee Johnson.Mississippi VampiresThis book is funny."
3,"Not as good as the others, but I'm still a fan","I didn't enjoy this installment as much as the previous ones, but it's enough to keep me coming back for more. I liked the introduction of the characters Claudine and Claude, but I was able to see many of the twists coming. I'm hoping the next installment returns the focus to the Bill/Eric/Sookie dynamic."
2,A Bit Disappointed,"I am a fan of the Sookie's series but I must say that I'm a bit disappointed with Dead As A Doornail. There's not much of a storyline in this one. It's more like a recap of the past stories and a preparation for what may happen in the latter ones than a story in its own right. While it's understandable that Ms. Harris needs to explain the roles and history of Eric and Bill, and many other characters, in Sookie's life to the new readers the first time each of them enters this story, I simply don't see why this needs to be done over and over again throughout the story. Also, while I like Sookie a lot and hope that she has someone who's deserving to love her soon, it's a bit too much when nearly all the male characters show romantic interest in her. I'm still looking forward to the next book in the series but hope that it can be much better than this one."
2,A former favorite writer,"I am very unhappy with Charlaine Harris. She writes very strong words. I loved her books up until this one. I don't get it what was she thinking? There was no closure, no satisfaction. After wasting $24.00 I was extremly disappointed. I'll wait for her next book to be in paperback."
1,Didn't care to much for this one,This was a disappointment after number 4 so I guess that has something to do with why I didn't like this one as much. I think it is my least favorite of them all.
2,what happened to the romance,"I really liked the previous books in this series a whole lot so was very excited when this book came out. I read it and there was no eric or bill, so no romance involving sookie. That is what I like so I was very disappointed with this book. I hope definately dead is better but it doesn't sound like it will be."
4,"Light, fast-paced, good","Sookie is back and there's more mystery to be solved. I liked this book in the series in particular because the mystery elements and suspense were strong. The only thing I didn't like was there were a few too many men tripping over themselves to be with Sookie. I know, I know, she's special, but it gets a little overdone when ever male creature in the book is making a pass at her.Other than that, it's a very good book. The sniper is in the background--you're worried every time Sookie is in the open.Her brother is in this story also--this family development is a nice growth area and it creates an interesting tie into the Were world. There's also a character in the book that has known Sookie for a long time and Doesn't like her. That was refreshing--to remember that there are going to be some people that feel threatened by her abnormality."
4,"Sookie's got it, doesn't flaunt it","Although Sookie seems to be slowly incresing her past and potential suitors (Bill, Eric, Alcide, Sam, Calvin, and now Quinn), I'm sure I am not alone when I say it is quite refreshing to learn that she doesn't fall into the sack with them as quickly as ""some other main character who associates with vampires in another series that I need not name""! When I read the part where Sookie bursts into laughter at just the thought of bedding two vamps at once, I felt it was a not-so-subtle jab at a once favorite ""some other main character...""! I like Sookie's world for the characters, (some who remind me of people I know), fantastic story-telling, and how nicely everything wraps up in the end. The only reason I did not give this review 5 stars is that I felt there was too much back-story involved. I already read the first 4 books, I didn't need a recap!"
4,Where is Bill?,"I've enjoyed all of the books in the series and this one is no exception. I do find Sookie maddening - she does a lot of illogical things and is still so immature that I keep shaking my head at her while reading. The most interesting thing in the series are the vampires in my opinion so to have them take a back seat was disappointing. Also, has anyone else noticed that Sookie's libido has gone into overdrive?If Definitely Dead follows Sookie and Alcide I'm not sure I'll be able to take it since I am a die hard Sookie/Bill fan but hey what can you do?For people who like light-hearted vampire stories this series is great and I highly recommend it. I've given 4 stars because the character development is wanting and there are many inconsistencies that someone should have caught."
2,Just Passes Time,"If you are reading these books from interest from watching True Blood on HBO, you will probably be disappointed. A lot of superficial story, no depth on interesting characters or relationships. Several ""new"" characters are simply plot devices that are killed off by the end of this story.I'm getting bored with this series. Consider Christopher Moore's Vampire books, like ""Bloodsucking Fiends"" as an alternative."
4,Charlaine is still my girl,"I love charlaine books, however this one is a little...off, I can't seem to put it into words, but I did notice a lot of you had plenty to say about the book. I read them all, and yes, I was happy that sookie and her boss got a little lips action, but Eric and Bill are my top concerns. I like calvin but he needs to move on to some other creature. Bill is kinda weak and Eric well Eric is never anywhere around when the real Stuff hits the fan, he always has someone else to do his bloody work. I still say Eric needs his own story. I lovvvvve Eric. and the Weres well, now that was an excellent story. and I cracked up over the Fairies. Poor Sookie and all the men who want to get with her. who to choose, who to choose."
3,"Scattered, Without Purpose, But Read It Anyway","Sookie is back along with the vampiric/shifter/were gangs.In this book, however, Sookie is never happy, always yelling at others and is generally unlikeable. Ms. Harris has thrown in too many new creatures/people without interesting, worthwhile reason. It needs more vampire and less strange. I look forward to the next book, in hopes that Ms. Harris will help Sookie find a more engaging kookiness in which to live. More southern vampire, please, less random creatures of the night."
3,dead girl Stackhouse [no spoilers],"Less than one month passes and the ""Southern Vampire Mysteries"" fifth installment ""Dead as a Doornail"" provides insight into the Were community including internal politics and brutal traditions when someone begins hunting down the two-natured. Though glad to learn more about another supernatural culture, I was disappointed by the faulty editing and lackluster plot in the first person point of view narration by Sookie.Sookie's witnesses the lingering affects of her brother's horrific imprisonment by a werepanther. The only exciting highlight is a new character named Charles Twining, a pirate vampire; otherwise the uneventful story and plot twists didn't engage me as the prior novels. Sam does demonstrate variety in his abilities too.The series appears to be young adult with tendencies toward action and suspense, not horror per se. I recommend this collection to any fan of the vampire genre.Thank you."
4,Dead as a Doornail Review,Charlaine Harris has written another great book. I could not put the book down. Her description of Sookie. the Vamps and Were are easy to visualize. I look forward to reading the rest of the books in this series.
4,A wicked read!,"The fifth series in the Southern Vampire Mysteries by Charlaine Harris sees main protagonist Sookie Stackhouse embroiled in more otherworldly goings-on. Brother Jason had been bitten by a were panther in the previous installment, and seems to enjoy being 'blessed' by shape-shifting abilities as a result of the bite. Just as Sookie breathes a sigh of relief over this, she finds that a sniper is on the loose, targetting the shape-shifters, and Jason ends up being the prime suspect. Sookie needs to do something to clear Jason's name before the shifters turn on him. Sookie also finds herself unwittingly involved in werewolf politics in this novel.Readers familiar with the series will see known characters from the previous instalments as well as new ones such as shapeshifter Quinn. Sookie, who has always attracted other-worldly beings, seems to have more than her fair share of admirers in this installment! If you like this genre, then I'd recommend sinking your teeth into this one:)"
5,one of my favorites of the series,"I was reading the other reviews and was kinda surprised with the bad ratings. I personally trully enjoyed this book, the misteries, the relationships....everything.I had just finished the Twilight saga when I was introduced to the Sookie Stackhouse series and fell in love with it. I believe what I liked the most about this book in particular was that although Sookie was ""single"" this time around, she wasn't really complaining about it - my biggest issue with Bella in the Twilight series, who apparently cannot function without a male(Edward, that is). I agree that Sookie has a lot of suitors, all very different from each other...good for her. She is considered attractive to the ""Supes"" because of her telepath quality AND her beauty. Oh, and she can be funny too. That added to the misteries surrounding the plot was a big winner for me. I highly recommend."
3,Kindle edition needs better editing,I enjoyed the book - you know what you are getting. However I'm getting pretty fed up to pay more for the kindle version than for a paperback and be presented with random format/font/typographic errors.Message to the publisher: I'm paying a full price for the book - please make sure that you do some editing before releasing the electronic version.
5,Narrator lost the Southern accent!,Johanna Parker has been doing such a good job with the accent up until this book...what happened? She still sounds Southern but not as thick. Also she doesn't put as much into the others characters like she did in the audio books up until this one. I have been listening to the series in succession and the difference is quite noticeable.
2,Boring! Hope the next one is better.,"Buy this one used or wait for the paperback. A real disappointment after the others were so enjoyable. I don't know what happened during the writing of this book because either Ms. Harris was not very focused on it or maybe she's just in a rut with her story line, but this book is dull and Sookie seems to be in a bad mood most of the time. Considering the character of most of the men in her life as written in this book, no wonder. This book focuses more on the shifter community and the politics of that group, and they all want to use Sookie for one reason or another. Hopefully the next book will be better. This is the third new book out this year by one of my favorite authors that was not up to par. Laurell Hamilton's new Merry Gentry book and Nora Roberts' latest In Death books were disappointing too. At least Kim Harrison came through with a really good follow-up to her first book, Dead Witch Walking. The Good the Bad and the Undead is a fun read."
2,Meh,"A very much anticipated read for a major Sookie/Harris fan, and quite disappointing. The main ""mystery"" is weak and resolved almost as an afterthought. The usually charming and sensible Sookie is cranky, frenetic and unlikeable (gasp! I can't believe I just wrote that!), yet mysteriously alluring to almost every supernatural being in Louisiana.The reader is thrown into the complex, yet deeply boring world of werewolf politics for no apparent reason. Yawn.The most enjoyable parts of the book for me were the cameos by Jack and Lily Leeds from the Shakespeare series (and even that subplot just petered away) and the always, always entertaining Pam.I assume all of this ""sound and fury"" is set-up for the next book, which seems more promising. Go library on this one and save up your cash for Book Six."
3,Not quite as charming,"This book was a little off. Sookie did not seem to have her usual down to earth Southern charm. Her relationship with Eric, which had been addressed over the last several books, was underplayed. There was not much of a plot. Wait for the paperback."
2,Disappointing,Lacked the strong developed plots of the previous books with undervelopement of intercharacter relationships. Disturbingly remeniscent of the later Anita Blake books with regard to excessive male attention that is annoyingly distracting of the main plot and its clear development.
2,I believe I will skip this one,"I have read 8 chapters already, It's really sad to say that it didn't start getting exciting until Sookie's life was threatened. There have been new people? introduced without even finishing up the Bill/Sookie/Eric triangle. Which is what makes the book exciting to me. I am not a fan of were, so that is a bore and the fairy well she is interesting enough. I am going to try to read one more chapter and then..that's it. If it doesn't get better in the next book- I'm going to give up."
2,What happened with the narrator this time?,"I've listened to all the books thus far and I loved the narrator's voices for all the characters and her acting capabilities. In this series you here her stop, drink something, swallow, not change voices when a different speaker is being read and it's frustrated. What happened? Overall the story is entertaining, I do miss Eric from the story line, but it keeps moving forward. I wouldn't say it's a ""Classic"" but I do enjoy the story."
2,Dull as a Doornail,"I finished reading Book 5 in Harris's Southern Vampire Mysteries last night. I wasn't too impressed with it. There wasn't much vampire stuff in this one, and I find the Weres and the other types rather boring. The author should stick with the vamps- they're much more dynamic (I thoroughly enjoyed the fourth book, which involved the vamps to a high degree). And what's with every guy wanting Sooky? It's ridiculous!I give the book a 2-fang rating."
5,~*Dead As A Doornail Review*~,"This is the 5th book in th Sookie Stackhouse Series & it doesn't let you down either! After I started reading it I couldn't put it down. Sookie's brother, Jason, changes into a werepanther & he deals with his new life really well. There is a sniper shooting the local changeling community. Sam gets shot in the leg one night while him & Sookie are walking out of the door at Merlotte's. The hotshot community think Jason might be behind all these shootings. Sookies knows that her brother is innocent & that the next full moon will be fatal for Jason if his name is not cleared. Sookie trys to find out who is behind these shootings to clear her brothers name."
5,Dead as a Doornail,"Once I started reading the Sookie Stackhouse series, I just could not put it down. After seeing the HBO made for TV Series, the first book was almost true to the book with the exception, of course, quite a few embellishments and altogether made up stuff. Waiting for the next saga to be released."
5,I Love Vampire Stories,"Sookie Stackhouse is a sexy, telepathic heroine who ventures into the other worldly society of vampires, shapeshifters and more via her relationship with her boyfriend, Vampire Bill Compton. Sookie does paranormal detective work for the vampires. She is quite the adventuress."
3,KINDLE VERSION REVIEW,"Very disappointed that this Kindle edition is not of the same quality as the other e-books I have purchased. There are no chapter markers! Just a percentage complete...I have no idea how close I am to a chapter end. This is the reason why I did not purchase the box set, because the books were all lumped together. I am paying a higher individual price per book, I expect the same standard of quality."
4,Worth Reading--,"Of the series, I thought this one was one of my favorites. With that being said......This version for the Kindle has SEVERAL typo's. A large quantity of the words are jumbled together. It isn't hard to read through them, but it is frustrating at times. There is also a scene where the author (or perhaps whom ever encoded this book) called one of the characters, who was in conversation, by the wrong name. I liked this book particularly because Sookie finally tells Eric what happened between the two of them while he was hiding at her house. There were also a few parts where I actually laughed out loud. There was a lot of repetitive information and the author sometimes lets the story line get away from her sometimes; however, if you have enjoyed the series up until this point, you will like this book and not mind paying $8 for it."
3,The 5th book,"This book was more about the shifters and weres than the vamps. Sookie as always is stuck in the middle. Given at this point of the story we only know she's a telepathe I find it really funny that she has so many supernatural creatures falling for her. In our world she'd be considered a tease, but it's written so well I find it hard that none of the guys have yet to put their foot down and tell her to pick. Sookie is also dealing with the fall out of Debbie's death and Eric not remembering their time together and Tara's got trouble of her own. This may not have been the best book but it is worth the read."
5,Best one so far...,"This was the best in the series so far. All of the plot themes are interesting, fast-paced, and tie together well. There were no lags in the plot at all, and the characterization and world-building was true to the series. The tension between the main character, Sookie, and her love interests was perfect... not too angsty. Sookie has grown stronger, relying on herself more, yet accepts and asks for help when she's out of her depth. I hope the rest follow suit. Well done!"
2,Worked great for 1 1/2 years,"Bought in fall of 2009 and worked for 1 1/2 years before it died. Called Kitchen Aid and because it was outside of the 1 year warranty they wouldn't do anything. I am unhappy with the overall purchase because when you spend $50 or more on a toaster, you do it because you want a quality item that will last. This was not the case for me. Little disappointed that they would not work with me at all."
2,6 months and it broke!,I wanted one of these toasters forever. I got it for cmas and the handle for the crumb tray broke within 6 months! $30.00 to replace :(
1,"KitchenAid, hang your head","The first issue out of the box is the slots are too short for the whole grain bread slices I am partial to. I overlooked that, as it has done a good job of actual toasting and was quite good on bagels. Now, after less than one year of service, it has mechanically failed and the control arm won't even latch down and start the toasting cycle. It's headed to the trash. I have several KA appliances which are great, but they must have sub-contracted this one."
1,Don't waste your money!,I bought this toaster and it was a total waste of money. We had to toast everything twice to get bread to brown. Now only one side of the heating elements work. It is poorly constructed and the handle broke off. We contacted KitchenAid customer service who was unable to help us. Don't buy this toaster.
3,"Does a good job of toasting, if the bread fits.","I does a good job of toasting bread. The adjustment lets you control the degree of toasting, and the results are pretty consistent. But, the slots are too short for many artisan breads or breads that weren't baked in a loaf pan. Longer slices need to be cut in half to fit the slots, so it can only toast one slice at a time. If you only ever toast bread that comes in squarish slices, this is great. Otherwise, be prepared to cope with slots that aren't long enough to hold a full slice."
3,Toasted but not hot?,"We have used this toaster daily for a month. We paid the bucks for a Kitchen Aid after 28 years of non-descript toasters but find this beast to be a rather strange machine. As many have mentioned, the center heater element is lower power than the sides. Since my bread is symmetrical, unlike a bagel, one side gets toasted more than the other. I've never seen such a thing. But the really odd thing is that even though it toasts the bread brown (eventually), it doesn't make the bread very hot. Odd. It's usually cold by the time it gets to the table. Again, we've never seen such a thing. We've had extraordinarily good results from Kitchen Aid mixers, both the heavy duty models and the hand-held model. But I think they missed the mark on this one."
2,Slowest toaster I have ever owned,"It's true - this toaster does a good job on bagels, but it is soooo slow and on regular bread products the toasting is uneven. I would not buy another of these. Normally Kitchen Aid makes better kitchen appliances and tools - they missed on this one."
3,KitchenAid toaster,"Pretty good product for the price; does good job on bagels but less well on thin sliced regular bread because bread clamps are too loose; not well suited to size of bread from larger bread machines; seems well constructed; bread crumb tray above average to use; power cord is short, about 20"", but it does store wrapped conveniently underneath the toaster; easy to clean."
2,What a dissappointment!,"The whole point of browning control is to get toast nice and brown how you like it, right? Even on the darkest setting toast was only light brown and seemingly uneven. Second round produced nice dark toast but, hey, twice is a pain especially at this price! Also, much bulkier than pictured. Not reccomended."
2,disappointed,"We were very disappointed in this purchase - kitchenaid has such a good name, that we usually spring for the extra money - but this one was a disappointment.My biggest problem is that settings are totally irrelevant -when you set it at a fairly high setting, it does not toast enough and then if you repeat, it burns. It was not as good as our much cheaper model. Sorry..."
2,"Bagels yes, Bread, NO","If you prefer having bread that is toasted on both sides look elsewhere for a toaster. Even when it is not on the bagel ""setting"" it does not do any more than barely warm one side of bread.In addition if you are looking for a blue toaster (how I wound up with this one despite the warnings about its inefficiency) don't buy this one--it looks nothing like the picture on the internet. It is purple, so not only does it perform poorly it looks terrible in my blue/gray kitchen.I expected more from a KitchenAid product and if I could return a used toaster (albeit only 3 times) I certainly would."
1,Don't be fooled by the KitchenAid name!,"This is an AWFUL toaster. If you want regular old toast, you need to turn the darkness setting to the highest, and watch it...the top will become somewhat burnt, and the bottom half of the toast will be slightly brown. Any setting less than the highest, the top will be slightly brown, and the bottom will not be toasted at all. The &quot;heating coils&quot; heat extremely slowly, and never seem to get to a very high temperature. For toasting bagels, it's a tad (small tad) better at toasting. Since the slots are so wide, and the bagel is also wide, at least the bagel is up closer to the &quot;heating coils&quot;.This toaster is awful, I am so sorry I got it to go with my other KitchenAid appliances. That's what you get for being concerned with the name brand of a product! If all you want is a toaster that looks nice, but doesn't function at all, you found your perfect toaster!"
1,Broke down after 2 years.,"I bought this toaster to replace my cheap $10 Toastmaster, which held up for more than 10 years [it was still working when I tossed it in favor of this name-brand toaster]. The sliding shelf that holds the bread in place is made of a very thin, soft and flimsy steel. After only 2 years of use, the shelf became bent and no longer remained attached to the sliding mechanism; and it could not be fixed. The shelf is hooked onto the slider by 2 small prongs that ultimately broke off. I am surprised that KitchenAid would sell a piece of junk like this."
5,So Glad I Purchased This!,"This toaster is great! Besides being the perfect color for my kitchen, it has slots that are big enough to allow me to toast bagels in the morning and has a special setting for such an occasion. I also love the warm functions, it is great for keeping thigs warm without burning them! All in all I am so glad I purchased this item, it has been a great investment and it has completed my kitchen (since I have red small appliances) I love it and highly recommend it!"
1,Do Not Buy,"This toaster was a major disappointment! 1) The ""warm"" feature does not work 2) Even with shade control at ""full dark"", it does not fully toast an English Muffin, requiring a second toasting, 3) The slots are too short and will not accept a full size slice of bread. I returned the first one as ""defective"", the replacement performed the same way."
1,not satisfied,"After returning a toaster from another company, we thought this sounded good. It was a bit more expensive but we hoped it would be worth the extra. We were disappointed. It is very slow and tends to toast toward the top of the slice of bread. If you put it back to toast more, it burns. This is certainly not worth the money."
1,Toaster failed in 13 months,"I bought this toaster 13 months ago. It failed today, namely it won't hold toast down. It did this once before a few months ago and then inexplicably the problem stopped. It's done it again today. It may be that many toasters fail in this way. I don't know if one's chances of getting a toaster that will work for more than a year would be better with a different brand."
1,Not the Kitchen Aid I once knew.....,"This is probably the worst toaster I have ever tried to use, but one of the prettiest....To begain with the color selectionknob (light/dark) is backwards, the darker you want your toast the more you turn knob to the little white slice of bread icon etc. With this knob turned completely to dark it takes one and a half cycles just to moderately brown an English muffin nowif you want something as complex as say an eggo frozen waffle you best pull-up a chair......After using this thing for about 6 weeks it mercifully died completely, lever will not stay down , no heat even if you hold said leaver down so I sent it to where it should have gone after manufacturing, in the trash can......Will I buy Kitchen Aid again (I believe blame rests with current owner Whirlpool)I think not, would I recommend HELL NO..."
1,2 of these toasters broke down within 4 months,"We got one of these toasters in May. In July the lever didn't stay down. We returned it and got another. It stopped working in November. Same issue. Although I love the way it looks, it works for s***."
2,Disappointing,Consumer Reports gave this a good endorsement but the user reviews on that site were less than sterling. I should have listened to the user reviews. This toaster is pegged ALL THE WAY to it's darkest setting and the toast only comes out with maybe a touch of color to it. It just doesn't toast. I'm returning it.
1,No warranty and poor quality,"We find this toaster to have all the features two people like us would use. The Bagel feature is outstanding. The controls are easy to use and everything toasts evenly.Another fine product from KitchenAid.WELL, THAT WAS THEN AND NOW WE HAVE FOUND IT TO BE OF VERY POOR QUALITY. AFTER A FEW USES IT NO LONGER WILL BROWN THE BREAD WHEN SET ON HIGH, ONLY LIGHTLY. THE WARRANTY IS WORTHLESS AND THERE IS NOT OBVIOUS WAY TO ADJUST IT."
3,Great Pedigree - Looks Nice - Doesn't Quite Do the Job,"After reading every toaster review I could find, my instinct told me not to spend over $15 on one. It seems that this is one category of appliance that modern technology, alas, has not improved upon. In fact, I have yet to find a toaster that is at least as functional as the ones manufactured 30 years ago. But this pretty toaster won me over. I agree with the other buyers that, after ""guess-timating"" and ""babysitting"" this item while in use, it can ultimately present a good piece of toast; however, not without human intervention. There seems to be a missing link between ""too light"" and ""cremated."" Caveat emptor."
3,OK for toast,"I don't toast bagels, so I guess I'm missing out on a key feature. I like my wheat toast light to medium and this works fine for the color. My concern is that even when I pull the toast out as soon as it's done, it isn't warm enough to melt all of the butter."
1,Why doen't my toaster toast?,"I have never seen such a diverse difference of opinions about the same product as has been made about this toaster. I am now on the second KitchenAid toaster which performs exactly as the first one did. It doesn't brown (even lightly) English muffins when set all the way to the darkest setting. I have to put them in a second time and watch to make sure they don't burn. I think $50.00 is too much money to pay for that kind of performance. From what other reviews state, it sounds as though these toasters have been manufactured in different locations and to different specs. I wish I knew how to get one from the factory that makes them the ""right"" way. I have (since purchasing this toaster) read similar ""bad"" reviews going back several years. One would think that KitchenAid would have fixed this problem. Take your muffins and bagels to the store and test drive this baby before buying."
2,Not worth it!,"I got this toaster as an engagement gift in Fall 2005. It matched my appliances and I was thrilled.It never toasted well from Day One, and completely stopped workiing before 2006 had ended!Total piece of junk."
4,Excellent for Bagels,"This is the only toaster on the market that has a differential heating button (hotter on the inside heaters, lesser on the outside heaters) to be used only for bagels. The cut side of the bagel (inside) will toast nicely, whereas the uncut side (outside) will only warm. The bagel comes out perfect, not rock hard which is often the case when it's been toasted on both sides.My only disappointment with this toaster is how it toasts regular white bread/English Muffins. Since the bread is thin, it is held too far away from the heating elements, and it usually takes two attempts to get the bread actually toasted to anything more than just a light brown. If you want your toast darker, you'll have to adjust your setting, and then toast again.If you are looking for a superb toaster for your bagels, this is the one for you. But if you don't eat toasted bagels that often, you would be better off with a more traditional toaster, without the extra wide slats."
4,Great for Bagels,"I bought this toaster specifically for Bagels. For that, it is very good. The differential heating, where the cut side of the bagel will toast, and the uncut of the bagel will just warm, is a very good feature. The bagels come out well toasted, but not rock hard due to toasting on both sides.I am however disappointed with the regular Toasting feature. It appears that, due to the very wide slots in order to accomodate thick bagels, that regular white bread and English Muffins are held too far away from the heating elements in order to sufficiently toast the first time. The toast setting must be reset, and then you'll need to toast a bit more in order to have your final toast ""well done"" which is how I prefer it.If you are looking for the only toaster on the market which has a ""Bagel"" setting (i.e. differential heating) buy this model. It is superb for toasting your bagels. If you are just looking for an ordinary toaster, or don't do bagels that much, this toaster is not for you."
3,"Acceptable for Bagels, A Disaster for Whole Wheat Toast","If you only eat bagels, then this might be the toaster for you. It is much better made than some of the other products on the market and is easy to use. The bagel function is okay, it does a nice job of toasting the cut side. However, it doesn't heat the whole bagel sufficiently through to keep it from getting ""cold"" quickly and becoming ""rubbery."" If you eat whole wheat toast or homemade breads, then this toaster is a disaster. I turned the thermostat up to maximum browning, but the bread was barely toasted. If you have the time and inclination to retoast everything, then it will probably be fine. The toaster does do a nice job of browning evenly with two cycles. For the money, this toaster just doesn't deliver."
3,Just okay...,"I've also had problems toasting regular bread in this toaster. Continuously, I've had to toast through two cycles to get the toast golden brown. Many times on the second go-around the bread sits in for just a bit too long and I end up with burnt toast. I still have a lot of experiementing to do with the controls to come up with a good, one-cycle toast. But the toaster looks great on my counter!"
2,KitchenAid KTT3400B,Toaster looks good but toasts unevenly. I would expect more from a KitchenAid product. My $9 old toaster does a better job.
3,Just O.K.,The toaster is a nice looking appliance on our granite counter top. My only problem is that to get the toast to look like toast you have to have the dial placed on the max position. Didn't toast English Muffins very well and I don't eat bagels so I can't comment on that. Usually Kitchen Aid appliances are really good but I am a little disappointed in this toaster.
1,Stopped working properly after only 3 months,"We liked this toaster very much to start with, but then after 3 months it has stopped popping up reliably. You can't walk away from it, but have to watch it closely to make sure that this time it isn't going to just stay down and carbonize your toast. Far less reliable than I had hoped for from kitchenaid!"
1,Mediocre...,"Takes two cycles to get bread toasted. Maybe because it is really meant for Bagels? The magnetic ""latch"" just stopped latching after a months use. It is useless now because the latch doesn't latch to hold the bread down. I expected better of KitchenAid."
2,Not so much,"Consumer Reports rates this toaster very well. (I do sometimes wonder about those ratings!) I agree with others - on the darkets setting it sort-of browns my artisan bread and extra-large (Wolferman's) English muffins. However, the pop-up doesn't work so I burn my hand on the metal frame in trying to extract the bread. And, the slots are just as short as my old toaster so I still have to cut a small end off the piece of bread. Maybe it's OK for regular, American, thin white bread but I never eat that. Thankfully the toaster was cheap - and it's red, and matches my other appliances. The slots are wide enough and that is its only saving grace."
2,Matches our appliances and that is about it,"Purchased last year to match the other KitchenAid appliances. If the thing made uniform toast for the 50 dollar price tag, I wouldn't complain.Just purchased a 4 slice Cuisinart and will see how that goes.This toaster for the money makes terrible toast - unless you like one side toasted more than the other."
2,toasts uneven,"I have owned this toaster for quite a while ,it still works but it toasts the bread more on top than bottom.Toast comes out brown on the top part and white on the bottom."
3,Toaster Lite,"Perhaps each one of this model operates slightly differently. Good for bagels if you push the bagel button. Overall, does not toast bread evenly so often reverse bread for second toasting. Not well engineered, I expected better from KitchenAid. Crumb tray plastic connection to aluminum gave out after a year, so now difficult to remove and clean crumb tray."
4,Chord storage,The chord has an awkward storage wrap underneath. It does very well with bagels. Good product design.
1,Don't buy this toaster.,"Worst toaster I've ever used. Doesn't toast anything evenly, not bread, bagels, or English muffins. I hate this toaster."
3,Nothing special,"I bought this toaster because Consumer reports said it was a good buy and that it toasted even, I find that it is not much better than the better model Cuisinart toaster that I had, but I do admit that it did a FAIR job of even toasting, but not worth the price for what you get, very plain and basic! Had I known I would have put up with a little uneven toast and saved 50 buck's"
1,wish I still had my old toaster,"I used Consumer Reports for this purchase. Mistake. The plastic cord holder on the bottom broke off. On ""bagel"" setting it takes forever on the brownest setting & then it is still not toasted brown at all. I have to run it through again on a lower setting. Just very under powered I guess. Better look for something else. I almost forgot the crumb drawer. On mine its taped shut because it kept falling on the floor spilling crumbs when I got the toaster out of the cabinet."
1,Lousy overpriced junk,"In short this item was dead and inoperative in six months. It is a horrible unit with lousy, uneven heating and poorly made. For the price look elsewhere as it is a complete waste of money. Junk made in China."
1,poor quality and function,This product performed poorly. English muffins required toasting twice on darkest setting. Very uneven toasting overall. Bagel and warming functions did not work. I subsequently bought Cuisinart CPT-160. Far superior in every way.
3,Good but not great.,"This toaster does in fact toast bread, but the bagel function seems a little weak. Seeing as how I bought this for the bagel setting is was a little disapointed at how it only toasts part of the cut side. Maybe I have a defective toaster but I can clearly see the heat sources that aren't working and only on the cut side. For the money it's not bad; it does toast very well on thinner breads, but if your buying this for the bagel function only your wasting your money."
1,PATHETIC,"I never knew it was possible to despise a kitchen appliance as much as I do this toaster. Take for example the frozen waffles I just pulled out of this thing and am now eating ~ one is nearly black on one side, nice and golden brown on the other. The second waffle is crisp but not brown at all on one side, and the other side is soggy...it's no longer frozen, just wet.Now maybe if this were a trend in how this thing ""toasts"", and if I really thought it was worth it, I could rotate the items being toasted when the cycle was half way done. BUT, it's never the same from day-to-day...except that this thing consistently fails at the one simple task it is designed to do: toast. Give me a break.This toaster in combination with the problems I've had with my matching blender (bought at the same time) leads me to one simple conclusion: ""KitchenAid"" simply does not mean what it used to. 0 stars."
2,Excellent bread WARMER,"This is a wonderful product in almost every respect. It's attractive, well made, the casing doesn't get hot when in use and you don't need an extension cord if your electric outlet isn't exactly where you want to keep it. It's also easy to clean and the bagel mode is one of those simple innovations that make you wonder why someone didn't think of it sooner. KitchenAid would have a fantastic product here if it weren't for one fatal flaw.Even turned up to the darkest setting, this toaster refuses to add a single brown highlight to bread or english muffins, in one cycle. Bagels do slightly better, but even they need a little more than one full cycle to toast them to my liking.Perhaps if you want a toaster only to warm up pastries and to toast bagels very lightly this might be the toaster of your dreams. But if you're like me and you like your toast browned, keep looking."
3,It's not bad,"I like the Bagel and Warm functions, but this toaster doesn't seem to toast evenly. Some parts of the bread always remain more pale than others. It does look good in black though."
1,If you like you toast brown this is not the toaster for you,It seems that you can't get a toaster that actually toasts anymore. I like my toast brown - to get that using this toaster I need to toast it twice on the high setting.I would not buy this item again.
3,KitchenAid KTT340WH 2-Slice Toaster,"KitchenAid KTT340WH 2-Slice, Two-Slot Digital Toaster with Bagel and Warm Functions, WhiteI agree with other reviewers who state that the toaster does not get toast dark enough. The manufacturer should heed the reviews because it is a good product otherwise: dependable and solid feeling. The ""warm"" function does a good job. It toasts brown bread well enough but on the very highest setting my English Muffin comes out heated enough but with no brown at all. A second toasting should be done manually because the muffin would very soon be too brown even on the lightest setting."
3,mediocre toaster,"for fifty bucks, i thought this toaster would be a little bit better. i'll admit, i wanted it because it was orange. there's no cancel button, and it doesn't really perform better than your average $20 toaster. unless you really want an orange toaster, you could probably get something better for the money."
2,Quality is less than I expect from KitchenAid,"This toaster is more a decoration than anything else. My kids eat a lot of bagels & frozen waffles, and this machine just doesn't do the job without multiple toasting cycles. Even regular bread comes out barely toasted on one cycle. I also had the plastic prongs that hold the crumb tray in place, break off. (How?? it just sits on the counter, no one is playing football with it!) I feel that I wasted $50.00 on this- save your money!"
1,Steer Clear of This Book!,"As a student and teacher of the Aramaic Gospels for several years, I ordered this book in anticipation of perhaps picking up some new insights or information. What I ended up with instead was an extreme, hard-to-read and virtually worthless book in a pretty cover. Take my advice and stay with Dr. George Lamsa and Dr. Rocco Errico instead. Their books are the only works on the Aramaic approach to the Gospels worth your investment of time and money."
2,One of the Translations of the New Testament,"This is NOT the original Aramaic text of the New Testament. It was translated one. If you need the original Aramaic text, do not buy this one."
4,pretty accurate translation,"This book is written in the language that YASHUA spoke during his time in our midst.Some evidence of ""Christian perspective"" is detected.This translation will show a better perspective of the new testament however."
2,Has anybody really tried these patterns?!,"I read rave reviews for this book (and also for her other book)but my question is ""has anybody really tried Ms. McMahon's patterns?!"" because if you have I doubt the reviews would be as stellar as they are. There are mistakes in this book -- very basic is the seam allowance which is 5/8"" or 1.5 cm. This is too large and it does not work! Also, there are steps which are missing in some of the instructions. Either that or she is assuming that we are all experts sewers. Many times, also parts do not fit properly into each other. I just wonder if she used the same patterns to create the outfits shown in the photos. It is really very frustrating to be inspired by the nice-looking photos and not be able to make them properly for yourself."
4,Cool & Feeling Good,"Again, I bought a CD for 1 song, yes I know I can download individual tracks but like to have the whole disc. I especially like Feeling Good, Bend or Break, Reach the Sky (which reminds me of Earl Klugh or George Benson) and some of the other tracks as well as or more than Cool."
2,Sing Song,Singing is not Steve Oliver's strong suit and makes this a lees likely to be played often CD.
2,What happened to Steve Oliver?,"Used to be you could count on Oliver to deliver a solid album of guitar-based smooth jazz, uplifting tunes that made you reach for the volume control, tap your foot, and sing along to the lilting guitar lines.This latest effort is his weakest to date, a mistitled album that seems to have been made on autopilot; the only radiance to be found is in the backlight used in the cover art. There's only one song here that rivals any of the best songs from his 2002 release, Positive Energy, a song called Good to Go that is in fact a pastiche of High Noon.The rest of the album is uninspired smooth jazz. Play it in the background and the only thing that will catch your attention are the three saccharine vocal tracks. I give it a 2, instead of a 1, for being inoffensive background music.If you haven't yet purchased any recordings from Steve Oliver, start with Positive Energy, one of the best contemporary jazz albums of the 00's. Leave Radiant in the bin."
5,Incredible Talent,"Steve Oliver Has so much Talent, He write's his own music, sings, play's and produces great music. Radiant is great addition to anyone's music collection."
4,Unreal II: The Awakening,"I have just returned the game back to blockbuster. I very much enjoyed the game. If you like fast-paced fps's, you'll be sure to like this one. The detail on the weapons was extradinary. The actual levels were a little dull, I didn't really even notice. The multiplayer is only on Live though. There are tons of weapons too. The audio was amazing with the backgrond music making you just a little scared. I was at points a little scared. The audio on the actual person you are playing and the enemies is very realistic. But there is however quite a bit of cussing, but it was never used offensivly. It was primarily used as stuff like &quot;Holy H*ll that is a big monster.&quot; Also there is a little sidekick robot who is very stupid and funny. He is very clueless, he made me laugh a bit. Overall, I think that it was a very good game, for only $39.99 at other stores. I would, for sure, buy the game."
3,Disappointment,"I am a big fan of the original Unreal Championship--even though it did not have a single player game. The original had a huge multiplayer selection of characters, levels, and guns--even if you weren't online. The new one doesn't. It does however, have a good single player and co-op game, great levels and enemies, but it still lost a lot of the great weapons and characters from the original. This was not a happy day."
3,Nice graphics but too short on gameplay,Unreal 2 has some nice graphics and you get to visit some very diverse planets but I found the game way too short for the price . I found my self on a few planets I found were fun to play and battle in but the amount of area you are allowed to visit was sadly lacking.
2,I cant believe this game is real,unreal 2 the awakening has a lot of problems the graphics suck the weapons are very ordinary the mission objectives are at times nearly impossible to complete and the thing that puts it over the top is its poorly written plot line the cut scenes are boring and you have to sit through them avoid this game and get halo or halo 2
1,Tired of stupid boring games...? Then don't play this one!,"I will start this review off by telling you how wrong the description of this game was.First it said it's vastly popular. I had never heard of this game untill I saw it at Blockbuster. It also said it has stunning graphics. Unless you've been playing Pong all your life, these graphics will NOT stun you at all. Actually, it will stun you at how bad they are. The enemies are like 2 frames per second.The ups and downs:Ups: There is Co-operative mode. The one thing that kept this game from being absolutely terrible was this Alien guy who talks funny, and garbles sentences.Downs: Everything about it, from it's graphics, to its stupid enemies, and it's aggrivatingly hard missions (like when you're inside a giant monster and there is goo everywhere that kills you) This is by far the worst game I have ever played. If given the choice to play Pong or Unreal II, I would choose Pong."
1,DONT BUY IT....,"This game looks worse and plays worse than old PS1 games, now I played this on the PC and I wanted to play it on xbox. Boy was I mistaken, the game looks horrible, and it just feels wrong. THe single player is just downright boring because of how it plays. And the mulitplayer, I played XMP (which is what the PC version was) and it was a lot of fun, but on Live with more than 8 people it gets super laggy. And the maps are for probably 16 people at least....They are HUGE. Overall this game sucks, I ebayed mine."
1,The First Doom is Better!,"I dont know if any of you guys remember the first doom on Super Nintindo, but this game is similar to it and that is sad! Today games should be around the level of high-tech. For example halo 2, games need to stay in that level or continue to get better which they are, (PS3, Xbox 360, Wii, and future game systems to come).Back to the reviewGraphics: 2-D things in a 3-D world 1/10Gameplay: bad 4/10Sound: good and bad 3-5/10Story: didnt really pay close attention 0/10Replayable: NO 0/10This game shouldn't have been for xbox at all. Its a discrace to xbox and the unreal series. Save your money for something better unless you really like the old stuff."
4,great horror comed set!,"fido,sundown,boy eats girl and blood diner are killer movies! earth girls are easy and parents are worthless boring movies. but fido alone is worth the price of addmission!"
3,Lot better than Japanese for Busy People Vol. I,"As seen in the title, I really liked this book a lot better than the first. Though I'm still not really fond of it. Grammar sections improved a lot, but the vocabulary learned is not always usefull.Also the way they teach the Kanji isn't great. They start to hard, there is no information about the Kanji supplied and there is no room for practice or reinforcement."
4,Good series but,"Just started with book II after having studied with book I. So far I have found the book series to be quite good; well organized, useful subjects and a logical introduction to the grammar and vocabulary for the most part. My book I was in romanji and although I found it hard at first to transition to the kana version of book II (the only one available for this book), it is getting easier.My major complaint to the editor though is that they should allow more spacing in the text. This is a workbook not just a reading book. There is not enough space for notes and hardly any space to write the romanji translation of all the kana texts and exercises. I end up writing many of the exercises on a separate sheet of paper which makes it impractical to refer back to it later."
4,Useful but more effort required compared to JfBP I,"I personally enoyed learning from this book. It demands a lot more hard work compared to the level I textbook since not only new vocabulary, new grammars but also lots of kanjis come up at the same time. I find it doable because Chinese is my first language but my classmates found it rather difficult. Of course, working harder is always the best way to cope with it. ;P"
5,Excellent Text,This book is excellent for anyone who wants to study on their own. I highly reccomend this series.The grammar explainations are clear and well organized.It also has Kanji!
2,Not for any amount of Masculine Energy,"For a woman who has any amount of masculine energy, this book will want to make you retch. On the other hand if you are entirely made of femenine energy, you will probably be able to relate well, and may find it helpful."
1,yuk!,"I didn't enjoy this book at all,nor did I see any value or sense to what was written. The entire gist eluded me!! I saw no insight or any information to deepen one's understanding of men, sex or love. Deeply disappointing."
2,Book Club Bomb,"This book was not at all what we expected. This was our all female book club choice and many of us were unable to finish the book. Personally, the true substance I got out of the book I found very valuable, but I feel he could have gotten that message out in a newsletter of a few pages. Otherwise, the book was so repetitive and redundant with a few good points and quotes hidden in the midst of a lot of fluff.Many of us are inspired to check out some of his other works, however, which we hope has more concrete exercises of how to achieve the ways of attainment that he delivered so vaguely in this particular book."
2,disappointing,Talked of moving through multiple partners if one is not fulfilling. Did not provide ideas or guidelines for improving relationships.
3,bliss,I found this book to be all a romantic could want. I don't understand why it is so uncommon to hear a man speak about his feelings this way. However after reading a couple of his books I have a better understanding.
1,Total Trash,"Oh, hell no. Deida is a clueless tool and this book is misogynistic tripe. Pass it on by."
3,grandsons movie,This movie my kids watched when they where younger and enjoyed it my grandson on the other hand did not like it at all scared him
4,What muppets in evil form look like,"Haha, this film was more interesting than I thought it would be. It reminded me of a cross between evil muppets, the neverending story, star wars, and an adventure quest movie. Quite well done for 1982 - it's always intriguing to watch old movies and see how special effects were like back then.The cracking of the dark crystal leads to two races appearing - the evil Skeksis and gentle Mystics. Jen, the gelfling, adopted by the Mystics is sent on a quest to find the missing shard of the dark crystal after his Mystic master dies. The film gets more interesting as it progresses, especially after the apperance of Kira. Other strange creatures are also introduced throughout.(Fizzgig is cute!)"
5,dvd dark crystals,was received in great shape.... watched as soon as I got the package and it was received quickly :) more words are needed
3,Enchanting and a bit pretentious,"This is definitely one of those films that define a moment in puppet film history. They were able to carry off an entire movie entirely cast by puppets -- and pretty well. This is the link between Muppets to, say, Farscape. But the story does take itself a bit too seriously."
5,Epic for all,This movie will become a favorite at first site. I love it for the memories. I believe you will too.
2,Not as great as I expected....,"Ok, I guess I'm just weird. I'm a HUGE fantasy fan. I absolutely devour every bit of fantasy related material I can get my hands on...but this movie was disappointing to me.I turned it off about 20-30 minutes into it...I was just too bored to stay awake.While I appreciate the puppet-work and the eerie atmosphere, this move REALLY could have used more dynamic dialogue to pull the viewer into the story.I was able to sit through the entire 12hr extended dvd version of Lord of the Rings without getting bored, but this movie just seemed to drag and drag to me...I couldn't get into it!"
4,"Very odd, but likeable","This movie has the creepiest puppets I have ever seen. Even puppets that are supposed to be creepy are less creepy than the puppets in this movie. Aside from the odd puppets, this is more or less a not too abnormal fantasy plot with symbolic and philosophical themes and a rock that's sort of like a soul prism. As far as movies with puppets go, it's about the best around."
4,What an amazing piece of work,"This film is very original and beautiful to watch I think the work the Hensen company did for this film is simply stunning.I only gave it 4 stars becasue I do feel the story does get a little lost at times but for the most part it stays on track.I would love to see more stuff like this from the Hensen and Co.Brian as the current head of his father's work has just as much talent and drive to do it.I love Kermit and the gang but this film and Labyrinth as well as series like the Storyteller are just so amazing to watch, I never get tired of them."
4,A Nearly Impeccable Edition,"A fantastic transfer of a landmark film. Highly recommended for any fan of Jim Henson and Frank Oz. Includes some interesting making-of pieces, including work prints of a deleted funeral scene that was cut for time. Also has an original version of the Emperor's death scene where the villains speak in their language, which was then subtitled. All in all, a great DVD, except for the glaring lack of a commentary track."
5,The Dark Crystal,"It's a Jim Henson movie, that's really all I have to say. If you havn't seen it, you should. This is a must see."
1,What are reviewers thinking?,"I finally saw the Dark Crystal with my son after I'd heard of it from my youth, but never saw it. The technology was interesting and supposedly ground-breaking for the day, in animatronics and puppetry, but aside from that, it's all downhill. The story was simplistic and uninspired. The characters aren't developed much, the scripting is dull and the presentation is so, so slow. My son couldn't relate to the narrative factor, asking mainly ""when are the characters going to actually talk?"" I was bored to sleep, literally on several occasions during the movie, and by the time it ended, I was relieved that the whole event was finally over. My wife's one comment after sitting through the movie was ""well, that was just horrid."" So, what in the heck do the other reviewers see in this clunker? It's a mystery to me and I have to feel that it's a lot of Jim Hensen is a genius-like feelings without actually taking an honest look at what the end-product really is."
2,"Strange, dark, and unsuitable for children...","I think the title sums it up. I can't believe Henson made this film. It's entirely too dark and strange for my liking. It still scares the hell out of me to this day. I can only imagine the effect it would have on a small child. If you want to watch something of this genre, whether it be by yourself or with your kids, get The Neverending Story or one of the Star Wars films. This isn't worth your time."
2,Oldies,This movie I bought because I had never seen it. If you don't mind squaking bird sounds and nails on a chalkboard- than go for it. I had a headache half way through. This movie has more noise than dialogue.
2,"Disappointing, disturbing, and creepy.","I loved this movie as a child. I remember being tense, scared, thrilled and enjoying this movie at the same time. So did my girlfriend, so I bougth it to see this once-cherished movie.The one good thing I will say about it is, the puppetry work from Jim Henson was really incredible. The movie, sad to say wasn't.The plot was interesting, but weak. The dialogue was non-existant in most of the movie, very little amount of words. It was disturbing, and creepy. There was little substance in the characters, and they were all one-dimensional.I give it one extra star for the puppetry work of Henson. Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend seeing this movie."
2,Dark Crystal,It's kind of scary. Don't get this film for your little ones. I definitely would not recommend it for children below 10.
4,Enthralling in its fantastic realism,"Perhaps not very well-suited for young children, Dark Crystal features several warped and mangled creatures and few, if any funny moments. Nevertheless, that is not the centerpoint of the plot and the entire film. Dark Crystal is good fantasy at the highest point in its evolution. Rather than creating an extrremely complex plot that will ultimately crush everyone's brain stems, Jim Henson created a world. Populated entirely by imaginary races (no humans, not even puppets), the world is so atmospheric and so enthralling in its sheer scintillating liveliness that one has no choice but sit and be fascinated. The craftsmanship is simply divine (I am still trying to figure out how Eugra's orrery, the celestial contraption in her cave, was originally done). This is an excellent fantasy film which does not find itself too high-brow for the average fantasy lover, and does not descend into the fluffy cuteness or simplicity of pseudo-fantasies. I loved it."
4,Masterpiece!,You can not go past theis classic masterpiece by Jim Henson and his pupet masters. Classic.
5,A great movie,This movie is a wonderful blend of a good hopeful story with humor and understated special effects. The animation does not overwhelm the story as in many new movies.
4,"""Collector's Edition"" not worth $50","This movie is one of my favorites, but there just wasn't enough ""extra"" features to justify the Collector's Edition price."
4,An old favorite Newly discovered,"I've always been a Jim Henson fan and I picked up this movie for that reason and for the nostalgia associated with it.This movie is a story told entirely by puppets, though they are lightyears beyond the Muppets. The detail on the characters and in the world itself [all created by Jim Henson] is fantastic. The sets are all alive and vital with just enough movement to capture your eye and draw you into the world without taking away from the story.The plot is driven by simple directives like Good VS Evil on the surface but there is more to the story than that. There are characters in this story that fall somewhere in between in the grey area where good and evil meet. That is the crux of the story. Good and Evil coming together to form one whole being capable of both.It seems very deep, but don't be afraid. This story is packed with action and adventure, mystery and love. Buy it. Watch it...over and over....It's all in all quite wonderful to behold."
5,My whole family loves this classic!!!!,This movie is such a delight. The puppet world is fleshed out with many interesting creatures. It feels like an epic for children.
5,Pure Fantasy,"The Dark Crystal is simply fantasy at it's best. The storyline is enthralling, the characters are highly imaginative and the villains are almost creepy. The ending will totally blow your mind away. All-too rarely do Hollywood's producers surprise an audience with an ending like this. I loved it as a child, and I love it even more as a budding writer. If you like fantasy or even a just plain great story, check this movie out!"
3,It's Missing Something,"A shattered dark crystal holds the fate to an almost extinct species called the Gelflings. The Skeksis another race are bent on the Gelflings destruction and will stop at nothing. It is the prophecy that a Gelfling will merge the crystal shard and destroy the Skeksis. The plot of this movie was pretty deep and good. One thing the movie lacked was humans. It's not that I am being prejudice, but I really had a hard time relating to the charcters because they weren't human. So I sat through 94 min. movie not really caring what was going on. The length of the movie may have had something to do with it as well. Henson may have tried to tackle to big of a plot and not enough time to really do much with it. I highly recommend just renting this movie."
1,A true letdown,"I bought this video because I normally like scifi/fantasy stuff, and the reviews were good. Unfortunately, it stank. The plot was very predictable, which isn't a problem sometimes, because movies have to run a specific way. I understand that. BUT, the journey TO the end of the plot wasn't worth taking! I felt like I was begging it to just be OVER! Not only that, the special effects were ho-hum, there was absolutely NO dramatic tension, the main character is a little brat. Here's an example. He's journeying with a little dog-thing, and it just helped unbury him from a big pile of rocks. It starts barking. He shushes it. It starts barking again. He yells at it, ""Fat lot of help YOU'VE been!"" Starting to get the idea?"
1,Nightmares....,"Call me crazy, but this movie gave me nightmares. The characters (I know, they're fantasy, they're supposed to) look creepy and strange. In one scene when an old skeakse (vulture creature) dies, it's voice is all raspy, and it literally falls apart. That alone was enought to fuel a bad dream :( And since the characters are puppets, the way they would run, I don't know, just looks strange in it's own way. If you're creeped out by wierd looking creatures in a wierd environment, stay away. To those who like the movie, hey, no hard feelings, the plot was good and it was good fantasy, the way it haunts me just overshadows that."
5,A classic from the 80's,"I bought this movie for my daughter for Christmas, I just realized she has turned 18 and not seen it . It is a classic and timeless. Any Sci-fi/fantasy fan or muppet/puppet fan should see it."
5,dark crystal,excellent.....clever animation and a good story line as well...really a lot more than a children's movie...some darker aspects could alarm little ones
5,Good vs. bad in a fantasy realm you can almost feel.,"Animated, but not animation. The Dark Crystal is almost too real to be called animated! It tells a timeless tale of good vs. bad using fantastic ""puppet-like"" characters set in a fantasy land. Only Henson could have pulled off the realistic creatures and detailed settings that send your mind into a fantasy realm that you can almost touch. Great for kids and adults, although it does have monsters and some dark moments. A treasured work in my collection... END"
3,The Dark Crystal,"I bought this DVD off ebay a year or so ago, I was so happy to get it since it was a movie I cherished when I was a child. The only problem is I'm not a child anymore, the movie didn't do for me today what it did years ago, it was hard for me to follow the story. Most of the characters seem creepy now, and I couldn't make head or tails of what most of the characters were saying, although I remember everything making perfect sense to me when I was a child. It kind of makes me wish I would have left it in my memories as this wonderful visualy stunning movie I remembered from my childhood, rather than the way I view it now as an adult."
2,Okay..not great,"I bought this for my twins... We have many movies and dvds. I was expecting great things based on the reviews (I mostly relied on reviews because I don't remember seeing it or people talking about it...now I know why!) My kids didn't like the puppets. I, who grew up with Jim Henson (and Kroft.. and all the other weird 70's stuff) thought it was kind of stupid, too. The themes (save your race/species) were too advanced for young kids and the dialog and characters were too boring for older kids/adults. Bummer. I was really hoping for more than this. I think one of the best things about a kids movie is that it is good enough for the adults to like, too. We don't watch it at all. Stick with Mary Poppins, Toy Story, Shrek, The (original Disney) Jungle Book, Nightmare before Christmas, etc. these are classics for a reason."
2,Don't if you haven't already...,"Let me just say this: I'm not giving this movie this rating because of anything technical -- nothing having to do with color, sound, effects, or otherwise given.Personally, I'm a lover of all things anime, fantasy, and sci-fi, and it amazed me that I had never heard of the Dark Crystal. Well, I went and got this movie expecting to be enthralled like I am when I see ""The Hobbit"" -- based on what these reviews said.Let me just say this: if you aren't already a lover of this movie from seeing it years ago, and haven't already built up years of appreciation for it -- don't bother. In terms of modern fantasy, I saw the ending coming from the first 20 minutes of the movie, and the story was mind-numbingly dragging at times.But, I'm just one viewer, and obviously against the massive tide of ratings. Just another perspective."
3,I may be being too harsh...,"Ok... there were a few idiosyncrasies in this movie that really bothered me. First of all... was the idiotic dialogue which ran through the entire movie. The fact that it incorporated very little feeling... and the awful dynamics and pitch and the background dialogue was stupid, a script written for little kids. Then the unbearable decision to have characters constantly making background noises for no reason, except for the fact that they're there.Then you have the irritating movement of the muppet characters themselves... just the heads twisting and flying everywhere... looking completely unrealistic and uncontrollable. But... this movie had some really good traits to it as well.The originality of the storyline was quite enjoyable... as was most of the humor. It has plenty of interesting concepts incorporated into it. I think this movie, if it were redone today, would completely overblow Harry Potter."
3,"Decent, but not the same as in childhood",I was disappointed in the movie basically because I loved it so much as an 9 year old I thought it would be just as good now. It isn't. Not to mention I felt as if the colors were not very well transfered to DVD.
5,this movie is one of greatest childhood movies made,this movie is a must for young people to watch because it will be a memoray kept for years to come.
3,The Dark Crystal,"During a recent illness, I had a friend recommend two films to me. ""Fierce Grace"", featuring Ram Dass, and this one. After watching ""The Dark Crystal"", which I hadn't seen in years, I realized that my friend was telling me that life has its dark side and its light side; it is only when the two are balanced and working together that we become who we truly are. Thanks, Emery; I owe you one."
5,Must Have,This is an awesome DVD. Jim Henson was ahead of his time. If you don't have do yourself a favor and get it. It is visually spectacular. I have seen it dozens of times and each time I watch it I see something I have missed that just shows the attention to detail.
5,The best Henson film,The dark crystal is by far the best Henson film. There has been great films by Henson but this tops them all. I loved this as a child and still do. I just wish They could make a puppet movie once again instead Movies like muppets in Space. But again Henson's not around anymore and a man comes like that once in a life time
4,The Dark Crystal DVD,"I have seen this DVD before but never had one of my own. I enjoy fantasy and this is one of my favorites. I would have preferred full screen, but the wide screen version is nice. If you like fantasy, I would recommend this this one."
2,An old memory,"I was there in theater when this movie came out. I ordered it to see why it had not caught on the old movie channels, now I know. I remembered it as more interesting. Service on getting the movie was excellent."
3,Frightening,"This movie frightened the living crap out of me when I was a child. In fact, it frightened me up untill a few years ago. These highly disturbing creatures are out of a nightmare, I don't know why anyone would think this was a good children's movie. The plot and characters are also a tad weak. But having said that, it is an interesting and very unique little movie. Worth checking out if you can handle the fear that the horrible Skeksis inspire."
5,I love this movie!,This is a true masterpiece! Our whole family likes this even the 2 year olds like it.It has something for everyone! I bought 2 copies! Good for a gift also.I highly recomend it.
3,A great epic,I final saw this film for the first time. Directed by Jim henson the creator of the muppets. Dark Crystal takes place in the ancient midle evil land. A Gilfling jen must depart on a journey he only has three day to find the missing shard of the dark crystal. If he does not the cruel Skecks will live for ever.He ecounters danger on his journey the Skecks send their Garthun giant lobster like creatures to kill Jin. Full of action an adventure this is a decient movie. If you like this I recomend Labrinth
5,Dark Crystal,"This is a magical fairytale for kids and adult alike. You cannot beat Henson productions for imagination and the wonderful puppetry. The puppets are infused with such character that you forget that they are controlled by puppeteers and see them as living things. The story is the usual triumph of good over evil, but who doesn't like that, especially on a Sunday afternoon with a bucket of popcorn! A brilliant film that has to be seen by all.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
5,Henson reaches new heights of visual artistry!,"In this too often overlooked masterpiece, Muppet-master Jim Henson breathes life into a world of mythic proportions. The storyline only serves to showcase the visual genius of the film. From the evil Skekises to the benevolent Mystics, this film is a childhood memory of mine that remains ""crystal"" clear to this day. It is a shame that this film has not recieved the widespread recognition that it deserves."
3,"Fantastic Movie, but not worth the extra money for the Collector Edition","This is one of my favourite films of all time, which in itself I give a resounding 5 stars. The Collectors Edition however is a disapointment, the only difference being essentially an extra booklet with concept art and production notes.For anyone who owns The World Of The Dark Crystal, paying the extra money for The Collectors Edition is unnecessary. Save your money, buy the regular film, and spend it on the sequel which Brian Froud and the Henson Company currently have in discussion!"
1,"You Call THIS a ""Collector's Edition""??!","Of course everyone already knows ""The Dark Crystal"" is Jim Henson's Masterpiece, but this so-called ""Collector's Edition"" version is probably the biggest rip-off in DVD history! It comes in a cardboard box that looks nice on the outside, but its cheesiness becomes apparent when you open it up. Inside is a little notepad, a piece of film embedded in a card, a little note written by Jim Henson's daughter, and ONE lonely disc. Said disc offers ZERO improvement over the previously released (and MUCH more reasonably priced) ""Special Edition."" Compare this to the FOUR discs you get in one of the Lord of the Rings Extended Editions for significantly less money! My advice: Skip this ""Collector's Edition"" and buy the ""Special Edition"" along with the beautiful Brian Froud book, ""The World of the Dark Crystal: The Collector's Edition"" (available here at Amazon)."
1,Awful,"It's a shame you can't give a movie zero stars. This movie is a union of Lord of the Rings, bad acting, and a terrible screenplay. ""They don't make them like this anymore""? Yes, for good reason."
4,Educational,"This book was interesting, not my favorite by this author, though. I prefer "" A Witch Alone."" This was a leetle too earthy for me, but it did really stress a connection with the Earth, which I truly appreciate. Ms. Green is an excellent author, and you will benefit from reading any of her work."
4,Lifelike look but fairly dim,"Unlike the prior reviewer, everything was included in my package and it worked great right away. The flicker is very realistic, which is what I was looking for. The color is a bit on the orange side, but does not appear like a 1970's flickering orange light bulb. I'm not sure how long the candles will go on a charge, but we had them turned on for 12 hours and they were still going.My only complaint is that these candles don't produce anything close to the light output of an actual candle. Granted, I don't think the intent of these candles is for light output, but rather the ""mood"" that candles create, and these do a great job of that."
2,Liked them while they worked,"I bought these from a shopping channel and was excited when I saw them demonstrated. When I received them one of the candles would not charge. I emailed Viatek and they informed me they would send a replacment which I did receive 2 weeks later. In the meantime, another of the candles quit charging. I sent them all back for a refund. If they had worked I would have kept them."
3,One candle stopped working within a month.,"The candles look great. The person I gave them to loves them, but was quite sad when one of the candles stopped recharging. I havent tried to find a replacment yet. Hopefully replacing the bad candle wont be a pain. I would have definfetly given 5 stars if all were working. Other than one candle not working they are great. The help create great atmosphere/ambience in any room."
2,"Great Idea, BAD Quality","These seemed like a great alternative to setting small fires around the room (real candles). The five of six that actually charged up and work look nice and are great for mood setting (wink, wink). However, try to find a more reliable product for yourself."
4,do the job for me,i bought 30 of them for my wedding dinner event. since the party is host at a historical building so the real candles are not allowed for safty reason. these rechargable ones did a pretty good job. many guests don't even realize they are not real. suggest not to put them next to each other because the light flikers at about the same rate so they will look like x'mas lights. but if you keep them apart they look more realistic.
2,Impossible to tell if more than one candle is charging.,"I bought these even after reading of others' problems with the charger. Everything they said is true - the contacts are fussy on both the charger and the candles, making connections hard to get in the first place and easy to lose if the unit is jostled or sometimes just from vibrations from people walking around, etc.In addition, there is a single red ""charging"" light that goes on as soon as one of the six wells is charging a candle - so you have no idea if one candle or all six (or some number in between) are being charged, let alone which well/candle charges are functioning and which are not.That said, I'm keeping mine because I only ""burn"" one or two at a time and it's not a problem for me to charge them one at a time as they go dead. I think for that kind of casual use it's still better and ""greener"" than having to buy batteries or throw the whole candle away once it burns out."
3,other,"Different than candles, lumens effects are not the same, but not a big deal. Lights are made cheaply and easy to break. One of my lights doesn't light up when charging. Look for another brand before making your decisions. If you can't find any, then go ahead and get these."
2,Viatek does not back up it's products,"viatek rechargeable candles set of 6: I purchased this product and three of the candles did not work right off the bat. I called Viatek and was told they would replace them, I have been waiting weeks and have never received my replacements. I bought a set of 6 from HSN 4 to 5 years ago and ran into the same problem. I thought they would make good on their defective products then and now, but NO, so I will never buy this product again."
1,Returned Product,The item that I received was not the item pictured in the advertisement. I returned the product.
1,poor quality compared to my other flameless candles,"I added this set to my 4 other flameless candles. Compared to my other (much more expensive) candles, these are pretty poor quality. 2 of the 6 don't work at all, and the flame is not nearly as realistic looking. To me, these candles look closer to Christmas twinkle lights than my other flameless candles.I bought these because they are rechargeable which is very convenient; However, my other candles have run every night for months on the same 2 AA batteries.I'll be replacing these with the more expensive brand I purchased before. The lower quality is not worth the money I saved."
2,Didn't feel like a real candle,"My husband bought these for me when he could not find a similar product by Philips that we'd seen in the Netherlands this summer. Unfortunately the Viatek candles aren't nearly as nice. The Viatek candles give a light that is too yellow and flickers too much. They just don't feel like real candles. They're also a pain to turn on and off. You have to remove the ""candle"" from the glass holder and push the button on the bottom. To turn the Philips candles on and off, you simply turn the candle and holder upside down for a moment. Skip Viatek and hold out for something better."
1,dissapointed,Poor performance right out of the box. One candle didn't work and two others would not charge properly...
3,Somewhat disappointing,"Right out of the box, two of the candles wouldn't charge. I've been waiting 2 weeks for the replacements. In the meantime, another candle has started having problems with its on/off button. The only quality part of the set is the frosted glass holders. Everything else seems shoddily made. I had hoped to have a more positive experienc."
3,Viatek Rechargeable Candles,I have several sets of Viatek rechargeable candles. Some of the candles do not hold the charge or the lights are not as bright as others but they are still better than worrying about blowing out candles. I also like being able to turn the candles on/off. I bought this set as a gift for a friend since most of my friends want a set.
2,Disappointed...,"Pros: The LEDs last very long. Once fully charged, some last for 12+ hours. Some last for 2-3 days.Cons: The LEDs flicker too much, too frequently. The color looks greenish. It does not look real."
2,Don't be fooled,Olympus calls this camera a 3x zoom plus 3x digital zoom (9x total). Don't be fooled. The 3x zoom is really a 1x zoom. I don't know how they get away with this. Total zoom is 3x using the digital zoom which distorts the photo. I bought this model only because of the zoom and it is pretty useless. You also must turn the digital zoom on again every time you turn the power back on. The camera shuts off power on it's own very frequently.
3,Hard to huck-up to PC,"I have not got this D-510 too work on my PC, PC will take the USBport from the Camera at all."
5,I'm Impressed,"I love this camera. The pictures are great, it is easy to use, easy to download, and full of features. I love having the choice of color, black & white,or sepia. I also dig the movie feature, it is reminiscient of old 8mm films my dad used to take of us. I like the fact that my 4 and 5 year olds can easily use it with the LCD. The price was really good too. Lots of features and pluses (...)!!!! I recommend this camera to all my friends!"
4,Versatile Camera,"I've used mine for two years so far and gotten alot of mileage out of it. What I really love is that it doesn't require special software to download pictures. When we go to visit, we can just plug in the camera with the USB cable, treat it as a removable disc, and transfer our pictures to our hosts computer before we leave. One downside is that the viewfinder doesn't quite frame the picture accurately. For close-ups, I have to turn on the LED screen or I cut off half of the face..."
3,Loyal customer: disappointed,"I own several Olympus digital cameras, and am extremely happy with them. I recommend them to everyone. I own several versions of the D4xx line, the D620 SLR, the 2500 rangefinder, and the E-10. I have 5 or 6 Olympus digital cameras in total. I recently purchased the D510 because I wanted something slightly smaller, and with USB connectivity.I've been somewhat disappointed with the usability of this camera. I miss the top LCD panel which was removed; the front lens door is difficult to open; and the spring loaded flash which always pops up and requires manual closing is annoying.I have only used this for a few hours, but I'm a little disappointed. It feels like the camera was designed for production cost savings and not an increase in usability.I'll post another review if my experience changes after some more use, but at this point, my recommendation would be to pick up the D490 over the D510 unless you really need the USB connectivity."
4,A Real Battery Hog,"This camera has served me well and takes beautiful pictures. However I spend so much on batteries. Have tried regular, heavy duty, and alkaline and none last. If I don't take batteries out after each use, they won't last overnight. If one buys this superb camera he might want to use an adapter rather than rely on batteries (unless he has won the lottery)."
5,Excelent Camera for the money,"After reading all the reviews, and comparing to other digital cameras, I decided to get this one. It has a compact design and it seems very well built.Picture quality: very good, excelent with natural light (sun), not perfect with flash. There are many options for taking pictures, different qualities. One thing I liked is that you can opt for the TIFF format, which does not compresses the image, very useful if you need to take a picture to work with it then (if you are a grafic designer and don't want to spend more, this is a good option).The quicktime movies are cool, nice to show things on the web.The Smartmedia Card of 8MB is too small, I recommend getting a 64MB Viking which is working ok.The only thing I have to say as a con, is the manual, that it's not very complete.I totally recommend this camera."
4,Shopped around,"I guess in todays high tech society It would be foolish to purchase something without fully checking it out. Well after reading all the reviews posted here as well as a host of others concerning different Digital cameras, I decided on the D-510. I use it constantly for my business and I must say that it was a very wise decision to purchase this camera. Anyone that is thinking about purchasing a digital camera for the first time will be pleased with the quality,functionality and overall performance the D-510 has to offer. I appreciated all the helpful tips when I decided to purchase a digital camera for the first time and offer a few of my own.1) Rechargeable batteries are a must.2) To save even more battery life I purchased a ""SanDisk"" USB downloader which is fast, easy and doesn't require you to use your camera(your camera doesn't even have to be there)...Hope I may have been some help...."
5,very nice little camera,"I purchased this camera as an easy to carry alternative to my Canon Elan. Using the default ""point and shoot"" settings gives very high quality pictures - well focused and lit, with beautiful color. There are enough features to keep most people happy with it for a long time. Just realize that you can't use filters or accessory lenses on it. (I knew these limitations when I chose it.) I am very pleased with camera and picture quality."
4,A Great Camera For Everyday Photography,"Ease of use, compact size and excellant picture quality make this a great choice for the average user. The USB AutoConnect feature makes downloading and printing pictures a piece of cake. You will need to use rechargeable batteries, regular batteries will only last a few hours."
4,Can't put it down,"The D-510 takes great photos, but it goes through batteries like a hot knife through warm butter! Get the rechargables!"
2,Watch out,"I just recently purchased a referbished item from cec-corp and the item malfunction in just a couple of days and i tried to gain information on returning the item but neither cec-corp or olympus would help me, so watch out for cec-corp"
3,Incorrect Directions!,"This is my first digital camera and I wanted something simple since I'm only partially computer literate. The lengthy instruction book got me through the basics of taking the pictures...until I got to the Transferring to Your Computer part. After a frustrating hour or so, I finally called Technical Support. ""Oh...the instructions in the booklet are totally incorrect."" Gee...thanks for letting me know."
5,No he tenido oportunidad de leerlo. Los comentarios excelent,"Quisiera saber si el Sr. Mc Donald tiene experiencia en servicios en la industria eléctrica, especificamente de Mercadeo Directo con consumidores finales de electricidad en el sector industrial, comercial y residencial. Solicito me informen. También me interesa conocer si le libro ya se encuentra en su versión en español."
3,Questions,"i have the questions about this prodect that can you download this cd on to the ipod, only with audio not the visualizing one. please reply back as soon as possible.ThankyouRakhshanda Iftikhar"
2,Joni gets spacy. I lose interest.,"While the poetry is as sumptuous as ever, Hejira doesn't do it for me musically. Jaco Pastorius may be a phenomenal bass player, but here his instrument intrudes where it shouldn't, and Joni seems intent on conjuring up a more obvious darkness than her previous masterpieces. The angel is gone, replaced by a more world-weary and cynical chanteuse. There are a few interesting tracks but they pale compared to what has come before."
4,Wonderful collection of songs,"I already owned Mitchell's 'Shadows and Light' live CD, so most of the songs on here were familiar to me. What I didn't expect was how much more intimate she manages to make each song sound on this studio recording. Each song here is its own journey and Mitchell manages to impart each with a feeling of depth, understanding and wonder. The music itself is a mix of melody and spoken-word, almost like she is reading a poem at times. What reminds you that she's also a truly gifted musician is the rhythm of each song (expertly emphasized by bassist Jaco Pastorius during his many appearances throughout). Her voice soars as each metaphor conjures multiple images and meanings: she's truly painting with words and music here! If you like that sort of thing, buy/download this collection and start enjoying."
4,joni,I'm glad to find Joni Mitchell on AmazonI emjoyed this album I;ve missed thar voice andthosed lyrics Very Happy
4,Jaco Compliments Joni's Work,"Joni Mithchell is a terrific composer, poet, arranger, leader, and musician. But why we should continue love her during this phase of her musical adventures--from ""Don Juan's Reckless Daughter""-to ""Hejira""-to ""Mingus""--is her ear for talent in bringing Jaco Pastorius to the process. If you are a fan of Jaco's incredible bass playing, these albums are ""must haves""!""Hejira"" is a terrific album all around: A sterling recording, wonderful musical direction, deep and intelligent lyrics while broadly appealing, and envoking so many ""on the road"" experiences (huh?). However, and no insult to Ms Mitchell, this album and the others of the era feature and are about Jaco Pastorius' playing, and that's why many of his fans will likley continue to feature these works in the Jaco pantheon of genius."
5,A haunting and ethereal classic...,"Always loved this album, always will. This edition sounds very clean and nice, a bit better balanced and less edgy than the initial CD release."
5,Possibly Joni's Best,"Joni has shed her trilly vocals on this album for a deeper, more mature sound. The bass (Jaco Pastorius, I believe) is also a really nice counterpoint and a very distinctive sound. Her lyrics are excellent as always. It contains the brilliant anthem for the disillusioned everywhere, ""Amelia"". Highly recommended, indispensible."
5,Joni's best...and that's saying something,"A deadly serious record that has aged amazingly well, Hejira is Joni's finest hour...and she's had many fine hours. It's astounding that so much great music and unparalleled lyrics are included in one package...this is a record to savor and one which has stood, and will continue to stand, the test of time.A remarkable acheivement."
5,AMAZING,"This is one of Joni's BEST Recordings because she really opened herself up in order to heal. Any recording she did with Jaco Pastorious is worth having in your music library. When the two collaberated it was pure magic, Joni brought out the best in Jaco and vice versa. One of the best songs on this selection is Song for Sharon. Some other notable songs are Cayote, Amelia and Black Cow. Joni's magical and soothing voice and Jaco's fluid and melodic playing embrace each other well. Do yourself a favor don't leave this page without ordering this selection and when your done here order Shadows and Light a Live recording from Santa Barbara, CA. Definately one of the best LIVE recordings of all time."
5,This album...,"on a cool, quiet, sunday afternoon coupled with a good book of poetry (verses: a book of love poetry) is pure heaven!!!"
5,Timeless,"I purchased this album ( That's correct, no CD's then) the week of it's release. About 2 years later, having worn out the original copy, album #2 was purchased. Even now, twenty something years after it's release, the CD,(Yes, a CD now)is a constant traveler in the changer in my car. Joni's ability to have you picture all elements of a situation, setting, emotions, actions and reactions, with one or two lines of lyrics is what, to me, makes her such a rare talent. Simply one of the finest pieces of recorded music available today."
5,Grows in stature with each passing year,"Joni Mitchell flew into my life in 1970 on the wings of a seagull ( ""Fly, silly seabird, no dreams can possess you"") and has stayed there ever since. The great album in those days, ""Clouds"", has faded somewhat with time. Not so with ""Hejira"". I remember the cool reception and low sales around its issue: ""Introvert egotrip"" was the typical critic`s response in those politicised times. Listening to it through the years, it is one of the select few non-classical works that grows from ""transitory"" to ""good"" to ""great"", till it stands today as one of the masterpieces of popular music, one of the few that deserve the label ""a work of art"". It may not be meaningful to call ""Amelia"" the greatest song in all of popular music, but one of the most perfect statements of the human conditions it must be. The whole album stands as an integrated statement, a journey in itself."
5,A Mercurial Landscape,"Joni Mitchell's great work about the wanderlust and insatiable thirst of the artist is a commanding,existential sojourn about the body as the spiritual being, traveling in delicious discontent. The title piece is haunting and hypnotic, as the subliminal unconcious unveils itself.Mitchell's prose and melodies here create an aching that stirs the heart and the soul.Blue hotel room is a love-lorn blues type of paen. Kayote is a colorful one night postcard of the ""passer through"". ""Amelia"" is a an homage to the great wanderer Amelia Erhardt. The pain and disollution of the self is epitomized in this great landscape recording. It is my favorite Mitchell recording, and I love most of her work!"
5,A classic,"This is one of my all-time favorite albums. All the songs are amazing and have held up well over the many years since it was released in 1976. Joni's voice is in great form, though some may say it is an acquired taste. The songs are often a little on the long side by today's standards, but you shouldn't let that deter you from listening to them. I haven't heard all of Joni Mitchell's many albums she's released during her lengthy career, but I would bet that Hejira is one of her best works -- very individualistic but also accessible."
4,One of her best,For some reason I had not bought this album in the past. After watching a Joni Mitchell DVD I decided to add it to my collection. Not the best in her offerings but up there with Blue and Ladies - almost.
5,Wowee Zowie,"One of my all time favorites. I never EVER get sick of this disc. There's not a bad tune in the lot. Stand outs for me include ""Song For Sharon"", ""Amelia"", and ""Coyote"", with ""Furry.."" and Refuge..."" close seconds. Although Joni always seems a tad obssessed with the opposite gender, especially on this disc, she isn't afraid to say it- which makes for a very self-reflective, personal, and beautifully crafted piece of work for sure. What a classic- positively masterful and a must-have for anyone who is searching for that all elusive ""desert island disc"". Pop it on in your car and drive; just wait-you'll understand."
5,A different sound proves to be surprisingly good for Joni,"It took me a long time to get into this album. It has such a different sound from all of her previous albums. But once I did, I couldn't get enough of it. Her lyrics are so poetical and brillaint. 'Coyote' and 'Refuge of the Road' are extremely catchy, while the rest of the album is more experimental for Joni, but just as good. 'Song for Sharon' and 'Black Crow' are so lovely. It's such an important album for Joni fans. It shouldn't serve as an introductory at all for newbees. I always say one should start with her first album and work their way up. Joni proves here she is a master lyricist."
4,Used it for three years and it's performed flawlessly,"And it's performed as advertised. I free-dive to 30 feet with it and it's never failed.That said, it is difficult to see what you're getting, trying to view the LCD in broad daylight through the glare-prone back of the housing, but that's the nature of the game and not a flaw in the product.VERY satisfied.fp"
4,Good Point and Shoot Underwater Pics!,"Easy to use and gives clear, colorful underwater pictures with a minimum of fuss. All camera functions are accessable in the underwater housing. Minimal lag time to photograph when exposure button has been depressed halfway and autofocused. Lag time is significant when not autofocused and when flash is recycling. Good results in wide angle and macro.I also used the underwater housing out of the water, on the beach and while sailing. I do not notice any difference in photo quality with or without the housing.I have been a certified diver for 10 yrs. The Fuji Finepix F30 with underwater housing is my first underwater camera. I purchased it 2 weeks before going to Barbados and achieved excellent results with very little experience. See photos."
5,The bomb (of staplers),"How many times have you had to pull out mashed staples and mangle the corner of an important document right on deadline? I think the Paperpro stapler means you never have to experience that again.We bought this after similar models received effusive reviews. If it is possible for a stapler to induce delight, this one will do it.It takes a little getting used to the noise = the stapler that snaps with its little spring-loaded hammer action. But it's effortless and a sure thing."
2,Not as expected,This dictionnary might be good for others but it was not what I tought I bought.I wanted the full french english dictionnary in one book.
1,"Cheap, lightweight, sharp - but terrible","Bought these because they appeared to be the best extendable hedge trimmers available for a reasonable price. They arrived today, and I immediately took them out to trim three blueberry bushes. On the sceond bush, one of the handles slipped shorter - when I pulled it back out, it came off! I put it back on but it wouldn't stay, so I duct taped it on. The handles are angled so that you slam your knuckles together when you close it if you have medium to large hands. VERY poor design. (pressed into a pot metal fitting). Heavy and expensive to send back, but I will."
2,Better have duct tape,"Bond 8055 Telescopic piece of junk. One handle literally came off while I was unpacking it from the box. The other within the first 5 minutes of use. However, since it was a gift I duct taped both handles back on and it will last a season or two. Very cheaply made and my last Bond brand product i assure you."
5,This one does not get your goat!,"I like unusual things to make bath time fun for me. The soap is so luxurious with lather I couldn't believe it. The scent is so lovely it perfumed my tiny bathroom as well. I don't think I will ever tire of the smell. It isn't one of those cloying scents, but very fresh and clean. I had always been a believer in milk as a bath item, but I never used it as much as some people I know. Well, I was thrilled after the first use of the soap (and hadn't even put any moisturizer on yet) and my skin felt like a piece of velvet, it was so soft. Needless to say, I really love this product and would buy it again, as a gift or for myself (to pamper me!) I am going to use the pail to plant bulbs for spring, so I will be using everything."
3,Breath of the Swamp,"The Showdown is an awesome and should be heard for those who have not listened to their music. Their first album was all out heavy metal/death metal style music. Temptation Come My Way; they chose a different direction and yes went the style of the ""Black Album"" from Metallica. I knew this was coming because they're from the south and they'll make whatever sound they want and they already have that ""southern sound"" like Pantera and Down etc has. This album is heavy but totally slower than A Chorus of Obliteration. This is a great album and every song is great but I like the aforemention much more though. I would give it give a 3.5 stars 'cause its heavy and the album is great but way different than what they sounded before. They cover a song from the band Kansas called ""Carry On Wayward Son"" in a hard rock style and they did a great job of it. For a limited time, Best Buy offered a free download song with the purchase of Temptation...called ""Snakes In The Grass."""
4,"They pulled a ""Metallica""....","The Showdown used to be metal...now they're Southern dirt rawk....At first I was disappointed, but then I realized the music is actually quite good. Much better than the garbage Metallica has been putting out since ""Load""..."
3,"Good, not great.","This is a decent album, has a few really good tracks on it. Nothing that makes me scream for more, but I'm not disappointed that I purchased it either."
5,Simply Incredible...,"This album starts out totally different than their first effort, actually, the whole cd is a masterpiece. Let me say it like this, If you took Metallica, Def Leppard, Randy Rhodes, Joe Satriani, Eddie VanHalen, AC/DC, Ozzy, Megadeath, Iron Maiden with a drop of Skynard, threw them all in a blender, cranked the volume and ripped the knob off you would have the sound that emits from these guys. They start with Whores and Fanatics and melt every track, including the heavy southern bluesy sound of It Drinks From Me, this is a powerful album with a great message to boot. Their cover of Kerry Livgren's ""Carry On My Wayward Son"" is a great move on their part to show the diversity of this album. This is a must if you are looking for a great Christian Metal Album that will completely rock your socks off. I could continue but get it for yourself, you will not be sorry."
2,Disapointing Showdown album,"If you loved The Showdown's first album ""A Chorus of Obliteration"" you will most likely be disgusted with this southern rock album. The SHowdown steers away from the fanatic death metal sound that made them so awesome and goes with a more Metallica (although not as good) sound. I would not recomend this album to any fan who fell in love with the face-melting music that The Showdown brought to the table with ""A Chorus of Obliteration"" but if you want to hear a lesser talented/more southern Metallica than this album (and The Showdown's most recent album ""Backbreaker"") may be what your looking for"
1,Aww Sh*t,"Well, lookie here, we have yet another band that decided to go ditch their previous sound and make a boring radio rock album. Okay, here's the problem, I picked up The Showdown's first album, ""A Chorus of Obliteration"", because it was a catchy metal album with some excellent leads. It took me a while to get into, but I enjoyed it. But here, with ""Temptation Come My Way"", you might as well be another copy of Avenged Sevenfold's ""City of Evil"", which is just bland formulatic arena rock. I downloaded this CD, because I wanted to hear how it would be. Well, it was deleted from my hard drive after I listened to every track on this album. I am so disappointed with this CD. If you're into southern rock or radio music, you'll cream yourselves over this. Old Showdown fans, don't even bother."
5,AWESOME!,"Here it is... take the best of Metallica, Motley, Black Label Society & Pillar and blend it into musical gumbo. Haven't heard the 1st album yet, but as a stand alone cd it's outstanding. Tight band, good groove, great melodies. The only that could be improved on is the arrangements. The producer got a great songd out of the band (guitar, drums and bass are a MASSIVE wall of sound) but there's no texture & the few harmonies in there are buried in the mix"
4,Great for small jobs.,"Small saw, great for electricians or plumbers. If you plan on using it for hours, get a corded saw. Works fine still after daily beatings on the job site. Only gripe is that the shoe can't move in or out, you are stuck with one depth setting."
4,GREAT SET FOR THE PRICE 11 SHOWS ON 3 DISC!,"Gallagher is funny and smart! He may not be the cutting edge comic,but he has certainly earned his place among the best comics. This DVD set has 11 shows on 3 disc and is a worthy purchase for fans."
3,"A rare find, poorly packaged","It is hard to find much of Gallagher, a physical comedian that I enjoy watching.This is an excellent collection of some of his work, including an early comedy-club appearance (you can tell he is unsure how his messier routines will go over with the crowd).Unfortunately, this package is clumsy in its construction and fit. It will not fit in any normal DVD shelf or rack. Far better that it were in a simple fat DVD box. The outer cover and cap are simply very-thick paper or very-light cardboard. It is certainly not firm enough to keep shape expecpt for the most careful of handling.Overall, an excellent purchase -- but do not have high hopes for the packaging."
2,"Great Gallagher, poor packaging.",The packaging is atrocious. It would be better to just take the DVD out of the original packaging and put it in an after market sleeve.That being said............Gallagher is outstanding!!! Worth the money!e
3,XBR411,This Is A Grate Item For Your Own Use But Not To Take A DVD To Some Other DVD Player. It Just Does Not Work On Another DVD Player. But If You Are Only Using It For Personal Use It Is Just Fine
4,Another great,"Right between The Eyes,Icons last chance offering,came on the heels of 1987's EXTREMELY RARE (possibly only 3500 released) An Even more perfect Union. This is the first cd with Jerry Harrison at the vocals and has a somewhat heavier edge than any of their 3 previous offerings.My personal favorites are the title track,2 for the road,double life,and forever young.There really is not a bad song on this record,as it is in the same tradition of this band's additional releases.If you are interested in Icon,you can contact me at [...]."
5,Icon-Right Between the Eyes Track Listing and Info,"From 1989.Tracks:1) Right Between the Eyes2) Two For the Road3) Taking My Breath Away4) A Far Cry5) In Your Eyes6) Holy Man's War7) Bad Times8) Double Life9) Forever Young10) Running Under Fire11) Peace & LoveProduced by Dan Wexler.Alice Cooper does guest vocals on ""Two for the Road"""
5,Yummy Grooves,"All really good, and flow well into one another. The PUTS song and Rainfall are my favs, when I played it in my car, my passengers were groovin' and all asked who I was playing. Not a fan of the ""Natural Woman"" track - but the rest: A+"
3,Treaty Cruisers,I have a deep love for pre-war crusiers [the so called treaty cruisers]. I bought htis book thinking it was going to open many new doors and give me information I didnt have. I was disapointed..I was hoping for more techinal datea and drawings to be included. If you have a deep love for naval history..itis not a bad book. I would suggest buying it used.
4,Beautiful and fascinating mix of East & West / new & Trad.,"If your exposure to Yo Yo Ma is primarily through his classical performances on cello, Silk Road Journeys is likely to be a shock. However, if you have heard and enjoyed the beautiful soundtrack to Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, SRJ will be a treat. This is not pure traditional folk music, but rather contemporary music inspired by the traditions of the cultures who inhabit what was known as the Silk Road, from China to Europe. I am amazed that such a mix of styles fits together so well. This collaboration of musicians from different traditions reminds me of the West-meets-East recordings of Yehudi Menuhin and Ravi Shankar. Even if SRJ does not have the cultural impact of Menuhin and Shankar, I admire the creativity and boldness of this project. Fortunately it is also very listenable."
3,A fine project that gradually becomes background music,"It seems almost perverse to not register a rave review for Yo-Yo Ma's important experiment WHEN STRANGERS MEET. The idea is refreshing, the premise promising. This CD makes for interesting listening on the first few rounds, but subsequent hearings find the music recorded here as interesting background sounds for an evening of contemplation. Is that bad? No, but the National Geographic stance of this recording ends up taking front row, while the ""music"" is only of passing interest. The vocal pieces are entrancing, the drum works exciting, the solo cello pieces give the impression that Ma has tuned his instrument ""scordatura"" to approximate pitch for maximum authenticity. In the end this recording is more a ""New Age"" experience than a classical music venture. Still, we must be grateful that the ever-inventive Ma helps expand our commitment to the universality of music."
2,A bit self indulgent for my taste,"I thought this was probably a pretty satisfying experience for the brilliant Yo Yo Ma, but it left me pretty disappointed. I was expecting more of a cello-centered experience than was delivered.I found the dynamics maddening...some of the passeges too soft to be heard, other moments too loud to be enjoyed; I couldn't find a happy medium.I think this was essentially an exercise in self indulgence."
2,Dissapointly over-rated!,"As a person who loves classical music, as well as Chinese music, I feel that radio stations seemed to have over-rated this CD. I am not use to the vocalist sense of musicality in track one: ""Mongolian Traditional long song."" It is far too traditional, in that it is very Asian; too tribal Asian. Art is highly prevalent in track nine, ""Franghiz Ali-Zadeh...,"" as it seems to be some kind of abstract music. This CD maybe great if it was created for background music - something to hear, but not for the enjoyment of listening. Aside from tracks 3, 4, 6, 7, 11, and 12, I would have regretted purchasing this CD."
3,"Beautiful music, crappy sound engineering","The music on this recording is stunning, but I have a problem with the sound engineering. It's one of those recordings that require constant volume adjustment - which I despise. Sometimes you have to turn the volume to the max, and then you get blown out of the water and have to turn it crank it down - a constant nuisance! Maybe this is just a quirk of mine, but would have given this recording a five otherwise."
5,Great Musical Adventure,"This is music for the intrepid, for adventurous spirits, who will surely not be disappointed. I felt like I'd taken a virtual journey along the ancient Silk Road and it stirred a great curiosity about the cultures of the region. Perhaps this is what Yo-Yo Ma intended. The rich, haunting vocals stir up powerful mental images of exotic places, especially the Mongolian track. All the musicians are at the pinnacle of their art form. Bravo to Yo-Yo for bringing this marvelous experience to us armchair voyagers. Excellent CD in every respect."
3,"Sad, but...","I love Yo-Yo Ma. I've been becoming more and more interested in Asian music, especially Central Asian music. I thought this would be right up my alley. I don't know why, but it left me cold. I'm the one who has watched ""Genghis Blues"" 47 times! I think I prefer Mr. Ma when he's doing Western music. I feel terrible and small-minded about it, but that's my feeble opinion."
4,Silk Road student,Each story is complete within itself and offers insight into the life and hard times. I found the stories very believeable.
3,Not for the average listener,"I was going to give it 2 stars, but then again i only listened to it once.I was looking forward to this, but the music is plodding in many parts,like a dreary symphony. There are fine moments, but I was looking for something a bit more accesible, rhymic, and lyrical. This is a mixed bag that seems to miss more often than hit."
2,Silk Road Journey,"I saw a performance of the Silk Road Ensemble and was absolutely enthralled. So I bought the CD. But it was a big disappointment. It's not the type of music you can comfortably listen to in your living room - I'm sure it would be much more enjoyable in a concert hall. There was far too much that just sounded like ""screeching"" to me. However, some of the pieces that were much like what we heard at the performance were beautiful. So - a mixed review, but I disliked more than I liked."
2,Hmmm - not sure,"So far this is a little disappointing. Maybe expectations were too high. Maybe one shouldn't burden something with expectations but come to it fresh - difficult with an artist such as Yo Yo Ma. So far it comes over as a bit of a mish-mash - maybe a bit too self consciously ""world music"" - perhaps he listened to John Williams' recent excursion into kwela. If he did he should have realised how risibly sterile that exercise was and not been tempted. Perhaps it had nothing to do with John Williams. Whatever - it doesn't really do it for me."
3,Hate the vocals; Love the instrumentals,"Hard to recommend this CD as the first few tracks are vocals of traditional music so bad as cause pain. Ma's playing is excellent and if you can skip the first few tracks, it is quite memorable."
5,Great Way to Introduce Degas to students!,I used this book after taking my students to a Degas exhibit. They loved Degas and loved to color the pictures. It allowed for interesting discussions on how he painted. There are some great picture books too.
3,"The pictures are amazing, but","The pictures are amazing, but all the shading is done for you. Many of the drawings are pre-shaded, leaving you little option to add your own coloring. Of all the adult coloring books I've owned, this is my least favorite, and I love Degas' work."
3,"Lots of patterns, few instructions",I was looking for more detailed instructions in how to crochet a yarmulke. This book is almost exclusively designs for multicolor patterns...it has one paragraph on how to crochet the basic shape.
3,Good ideas - not complete guide,"The Complete Guide is a great addition to your library if you have the basics of Yarmulka crocheting under your belt. The patterns seem to be good for the personalizing of the yarmulkas, but you do need to know the basics of Yarmulka crocheting first. If you do not know how to start a Yarmulka or how to read a chart or how to do color changes, you may need a hand in getting started. My plan is to learn these things and then make some Yarmulkas for my son's Bar Mitzvah.I do know how to crochet and by no means consider myself a beginner. This book has thrown me and made me question my ability."
5,Great Book,Great Book has many yamulka designs.If you have a problem crocheting or if you tried to crochet and still can't understand it then you need to buy a book specifically for learning how to crochet. I love this book and it works for me.
2,Not so great,"The patterns would be great if it wasn't used for a yarmulka. You can't add stitches during the pattern, which makes the yarmulka look like a hat for a ""conehead"". Also, you'd better be pretty good at crocheting before starting one because the directions are not the best.Good patterns to be used for something besides the yarmulka."
1,Missing Parts,I ordered 3 Burners. One was missing the stainless steel burner kit. Not a real big deal but an inconvenience.
5,Great for learning,"Just like Line Dance 101, this DVD was very well received. My wife and I both loved it. It was a little faster paced than 101, but we felt prepared and could keep up. The dances are fun and presented very well. We like the way Shawn breaks down the dances and then has you learn with him. We liked Essential Line Dances Volume 2 for the same reasons."
2,Somewhat lame,"This video is nice because it shows you many different camera angles, so if you're a person who has a tough time catching on, that is helpful. However, the dances aren't even taught to good country music and it's hard to adapt the dances to real life. This is a good video if you just want to learn to do them at your own house and dance to the video to get a little exercise."
4,Cb4.,"I am not a huge Chris Rock fan, But I enjoyed Cb4 and it's parodying. I thought Kandi Alexander(newsradio) was sexy and Great, I thought the movie was funny, in a silly sort of way.I enjoyed Phil Hartman's(R.I.P.) Role too."
4,Funnier than thought it would be,"Friend told me about the movie and cited some funny quotes from it so i thought i would try it. To tell the truth i was not expecting much, but the movie was pretty funny (funny crazy), and a lot better than i expected."
4,cb4 (cell block 4) amazing and dumbfounding all at once,"cb4 is the most amazing movie of all time. dealing with everything people want to see. violence, sex, music and it's hularious."
4,good film,this is Chris Rock at his best.the spoof of NWA is funny.in a fair world Charles Murphy Eddie's Brother would get more Love.cuz Bro Man is as important to the film as Chris Rock.it's a real cool look into the business.the cast was solid.
2,You laughed at this? ...really??!!,"It's got a vaguely nave feel like an early Spike Lee film, and that's about all I can say good about this turkey. No, that's not quite true: it's got Chris Elliott and Esther in it. Also, it's slightly better than `Fear of a Black Hat,' but I suspect the only reason is the merciful absence of `Booty Juice.'The only other important thing to know about this movie is that it's not a rap Spinal Tap. No one to my knowledge has made a decent rap mockumentary; but then again, I haven't seen the 50-Cent movie yet."
3,Took a Month,"It was probably the post office fault. but, the delivery took exactly a month. There was no Traking Number to find where it was. Also, good service on replying to E-mails and the product was in Good Condition"
4,CB4 is in the house!,"A hysterical almost forgotten treasure of a movie!I hadn't seen this in a long time, and wondered if it was still as funny as I remembered. It IS! And for $10, well worth purchasing. I'd have given this 5 stars, but the complete lack of bonus material kept this from getting a perfect score."
5,Unfailing,"This is a VERY-good representation of one of the GIANTS (although, usually ... unheralded) of jazz - Red, on vibraphone. The late Whitney Balliett had some great insights and columns (the latter, in The New Yorker) about Red, and there's really, NOT a poor performance that some of us know-of (of his), on record. His art was subtle, but very-fluent ... and original."
4,Decent Value for the price - Fabulous Color,"The color of these wash cloths is an adorable shade of pastel violet. I've used and washed them four times now, and they came out soft and fluffy each time and as vibrant as ever. The hand towels are nice too. I also bought some in deep fern and am happy with those as well.If you are looking for a decent wash cloth at a low price that comes in a great color, then I recommend this product for you."
4,whirl out,we were told to use whirl out for our problems with our front loaderwashing machine by LG. it's an easy to use product and helped clean alot of the weird residue behind the rubber gaskets
4,EZ clean time,"Owning a lodging establishment, with three jacuzzi type tubs, any product that makes the cleaning process quicker/easier gets my vote!Put in water, run the pump, dump in the powder, after 3-5 minutes, drain and rinse.Purges all the ""nasties"" out of the plumbing and jets.Cool stuff!"
4,it worked for my HE washer,"My HE washer is stinky. It is under a year old, cost $2500 for the washer/dryer set and it still works great but the washer stinks terribly like sewer water. I've tried everything including getting a repairman, hot bleach water in the tub overnight, affresh tablets, oxyclean overnight, wiping everything out, etc... This item is designed to clean the pipes of the spa bathtub, but someone reviewed it as also working for washers. It isn't perfect but it by far was the best improvement in smell after I used this product."
4,Also for washing machines...,"Used this as part of a cleaning of our front load washer. Worked great, water clean and smell free months later..."
1,Horrible Waste of Money and Time,"I bought this thinking it would clean out the jets in my whirpool bath tub. I followed the directions and it did almost nothing. A few pieces of gunk came out, but the jets were still dirty. What works MUCH better is bleach and powdered dishwasher detergent. Don't waste your money."
2,Whirlout Woes,The Whirlout Pipe Cleaner did not clean my jacuzzi tub as well as I hoped it would. There was a lot of soap suds generated during use which I assume means it cleaned soap out of the pipes but the outer surfaces of the jets that are exposed in the tub did not come clean. It also takes half of the bottle for each use and is recommended that it be used once a week. This can become very expensive. I would not recommend this product.
4,Time-consuming,"I received this product (professionally packaged & in a timely manner). Although, it wasn't difficult to use, it is a process (fill the tub of water over the jets, drain, then refill to rinse). I would have preferred direct application to jets/suction intake w/o so much use of water; otherwise, I would recommend this product (it works) & I would make future purchases from this seller."
3,OK...with a catch.,"The instructions basically say wash,rinse, repeat as needed. Well, the catch is I had to ""repeat"" six times to get good results. I bought a house that had been vacant for a long time and there was a bunch of gunk coming out of the jets when I used this, but I had to do it over and over and over again before I stopped seeing the gunk. Between filling each time, I used my highest pressure with my sprayer to spray out more gunk out of the jets. I wish I would have run them before I used this product for comparison but I didn't. Overall, I am hoping this got the job done, but took an awful lot of time, water and work."
3,Works but doesn't go very far.,"Bought this based on positive reviews combined with competitive pricing. Prices aren't so competitive when the instructions are to pour half the bottle into the tub. Still, did get it nice and clean. But given the price per treatment, I'll be trying a different product next time."
3,STILL DEALING WITH FALL OUT,"Two applications later, I am still getting major hard water deposits coming out of the ports. Might take an additional bottle to get the job done. Kind of costly for the results."
5,Great Sound Track from a great movie!,This is one of the classic movies & music sound tracks in my book. A blast from the past. Check it o u t for yourself. Listen to a few sound bites @ Amazon.
4,It is a decent supplement to learning Spanish,"I use the Instant Immersion series as a supplement to Pimsleur and written materials for reading and writing Spanish. I have completed the first Instant Immersion Spanish series and am starting the Advanced Instant Immersion Spanish series.After completing this series alone, you will not be fluent in Spanish. But for the price, it is a decent supplemental program to learning Spanish.You do learn a lot of useful vocabulary and some grammar on each CD. Then at the end of each CD is a conversation in Spanish. You listen and repeat the conversation in Spanish; every sentence is translated into English. Then you listen to the conversation in English and answer questions.The CDs are interesting and a change of pace in your Spanish language studies. All in all, a good value for the price."
2,Not for the layperson,"I'm not an anthropologist, and I have to think this book is better aimed at that audience than laypeople. I read the book during a trip to Namibia this month. I found it informative in terms of history of the bushmen, but I thought there were some holes in the author's logic. He also seemed to be pretty critical of the Herero tribe. I didn't walk away with any conclusion from the author, other than the fact that common assumptions about Bushmen over time have been erroneous. Better reading for the layperson prior to a Namibia trip would be Colin Leys ""Histories of Namibia"" and his ""Namibia's Liberation Struggle"", best read in that order (though those books don't highlight bushmen).Paul"
5,Tower Stand,The stand came in 2 days. It assembled easily and it enables me to move and access my tower with ease. I am very satisfied with the product and the vendor.
1,Nothing more than a bland personal account,"It's always bemusing to see the medicos who have developed writing/journalism/media as a ""side"", for many of them are very ordinary. Anyone who has been through med school will realise that for the lay reader, this collection of anecdotes isn't particularly brilliant writing. If you are looking for brilliance, try Melvin Konner's ""Becoming a doctor- a journey of initiation through medical school"", or for farce Samuel Shem's book aboout psych. residency, ""Mt.Misery"". I think any med student could have written this short book of drab observations just as well."
3,"15,000 what?","This is called ClickArt Fonts 15,000. But that's just the name of the product, not a description of how many fonts or files that are actually in the package. I'd be surprised if there are more than a couple of hundred. Second, it installs its own software to load the fonts for you. This is convenient if you don't know how to use a computer, but a waste of your hard drive otherwise.But, for $4, what did I expect?"
1,A lot of ugly fonts,"If your into collecting a lot of ugly fonts & many ""handwritten"" style bogus fonts - then this pack is for you. Sorry to say that this wasn't one of my satisfying buying experiences."
4,Very good!,Tousands of great fonts! And you can choose to explore the CD and copy them all to your pc (170MB).
3,,"This band takes a slow, agonizing approach to their music, working on a particular riff and playing it over and over. Through minimalistic passages, sinister atmospheres are achieved. The songs run mostly from slow to mid tempo, and the monotonousness might bore some people. You have to be a fan of raw, doom-ish black metal the way bands like Xasthur play it to be able to appreciate this."
5,Butterly Factor Books and Songs,A friend gave me this lovely little book for Easter. It was so easy to read.The characters are fun and creative. I couldn't believe the music. I was surprised it is not available yet anywhere else!
1,Tantalizing Camera,"You should be ""The Flash"" to use this camera. After you use your fingers 6 or 8 times to set up the flash, it turns off in 30 seconds and you, like Tantalus,must do it again and again...Don't be mislead, we expected good things from Vivitar, but, sincerely. this camera is pure thrash."
1,This camera is awful!,"Whatever you do, DO NOT BOTHER TO GET THIS CAMERA!! I have had 3, and they all work at first, but after a week or so, they have all messed up! At first, i thought it was the computer, but we got a new computer, and have had problems with the camera ever since. Just remember, ""You get what you pay for!"""
4,Great Little Camera,"I bought this camera at a nearby Wal-mart for 79.99 cdn and I could not have spent a better dollar. It is a great kit including case, stand, cord, drivers and wrist strap. It is compact in size and plausable in appearance. It has many options for any type of light amount inside or outside. It includes ArcSoft's Photo Impression 3 which is great photo editing software for any camera, scanner or picture. Some reviews say it is a bad camera, that is only because they either expect alot from a basic camera or they know nothing about digital photography.In total I would rate this 4 out of 5I recommend this camera to anyone that wants a basic digital camera for use like an ordinary camera, as it is great for vacations, occasions or any other activity you would take a snapshot of. It is GREAT for e-mailing and websites and it also doubles as a fine webcam. But remember it is a basic camera that can meet your needs but do not expect a ""super camera!""Peace out y'allandCANADA RULZ!!!!!"
3,vivitar camera,I am surprised at how quickly I received this camera. I was happy to receive it. I haven't used it yet but will soon.
3,love it --hate it,"First digital and for the price I paid at wallyworld ,I would have only gotten 2 disposables with development.Auto shut is annoying ,and no way to over ride.menu scrolling also annoying , no way to save settings.No viewer ,so until you upload pics you don't know what your getting.GOOD THINGS....once you figure it out it takes really good standard photos.easy to upload and edit photos.Being left handed ,it seemed to work better for me ,than for right handed people.very easy ob batterries , replaced once after 6 months of use ,and then after 4 month due to using flash more.close ups are great ,when they work -50/50 success with same settings ,same photo.all in all , despite the annoying features it was a good fist camera for it's time.would be considered a dinasaur by todays standings, but still good for e-bay photos and online photo albums."
3,Loved this camera.,"This was my first digital camera, back in 2002. I liked it cause it would take weird pictures that would make great photoshopped images. The image quality is ok, pretty decent I would say.Nowadays this camera would be okay for kids and such. It's fun and so are the images it develops..."
2,"In this case, cheap just ain't worth it","I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. Not to kids, not to adults who just want a quick-and-dirty way to get images on the web. That was my goal in buying this camera, but it didn't take me long to go after a refund.Indoors, the pictures are way too dark, even with the flash. The power button worked only half the time, but photos came out fuzzy every time.When I took it in for a refund, the woman at the counter said, ""Wow. This must be the one to return."" I asked, ""So I'm not the only one?"" And she said, ""No way.""That was enough for me."
2,Better Bird Identification Desired,"Wonderful information presented very nicely. However, if searching for a book with photos/drawings of birds to aid young potential birdwatchers a buyer may want to make another choice.The illustrations are much too muted/soft for noting distinctions/characteristics which would be helpful for child and adult alike."
5,expected,Was exactly what I have come to expect from Johnson. Perfect fir my quiet times and personal devotions. Ver calming and introspective. Enjoy the Celtic sound and prayerfullness in this project.
4,Concise and Thorough,"This guidebook is kind of an intensive read. To fully benefit from all the knowledge it contains, be prepared to spend a full day or two experimenting with the camera as per the specific ""exercises"" in depth of field, light metering etc. that the book outlines. An absolute beginner in the medium of photography, (such as myself) might be intimidated on first glance, but the info is all there.The only shadow of objection that I have with this book is with the unnecessary and, (in my opionion) gratuitous depiction of semi-nude women throughout in example photos, (lol.)Otherwise... definitely worth the moneyDensely-packed informative guide that adequately explains the idiosyncrasies of the EOS Rebel TI 300V."
4,Beautiful,"I bought four so as to have three kinds of vinegar as well as olive oil on the table. The glass and the shape of the glass, vorh emphasize the colors od rhw xonrwnra, and so it's a very beautiful set on a lazy susan. Minor complaint is that the caps and necks are not tight. I expected a better fit, but by and large that's a minor quibble"
4,"Sound, but dated despite revision","This is a competent example of the many formula based books on leadership, one built round four dimensions of vision, engagement with reality, ethics and courage. Originally published in 1991, much of what it argues is now part of the common currency of the literature. It is well set out and simply written, but does not really engage with the great issues of today's society. Similarly, there is no explicit definition of leadership, the implicit definition used being a traditional one that is under considerable challenge."
2,It's a shame about this record,"I was pretty disappointed when this came out. It just never grabbed ahold of me like the earlier stuff. It seemed like Evan Dando was trying to showcase his singing/songwriting to the detriment of the music. But it could be my personal preference for the harder edge on ""Lick"" and ""Creator"""
1,It's a shame about the lemonheads,"After one reviewer clamed this album was ""Better than Joy Division! Better than the Smiths!"" I was surprised to find that ""It's a Shame about Ray"" was completely unimpressive music. The Lemonheads are not unique in any way; their music is equivalent to hearing a fly buzz. This album could be a soundtrack to a Dawson's Creek episode. Lyrics are neither appallingly stupid nor heart moving. Anyone playing with Fruity Loops on their P.C. could create a more unique sound than The Lemonheads ""It's a Shame about Ray."" If you like unmoving, unimpressive, downright boring music, this album is for you."
4,Worth the price of admission just for this one couplet...,"""she's the puzzle piece behind the couch/that made the sky complete"" from ""Allison's Starting To Happen"". This album is chock full of power pop gems. At turns sad (title track, ""Drug Buddy"") and bouyant (""Allison"", ""Bit Part"") and both at once (""Rudderless""). My only complaint is that it's over in 30 minutes. Truly one of the best early 90 ""alternative"" albums."
5,"defined ""Alternative"" in the 90's.","This is an all time favorite record. It came out just when i was getting tired of Whitesnake on Motley Crue and around the same time i discovered Nirvana and Soundgarden. the 80's were great but it was time for something a little deeper and yet a little simpler. This record did it. I love this record and it sings my memories right back at me and still accompanies me on new ones. That other guy called Pearl Jam, Tool and Radiohead lame?! remind me to scratch him off my Christmas list."
4,good service,"I had a small problem with this order, a slightly different edition was sent, but when I contacted the seller, they made an immediate correction. The service was excellent and rapid and I would certainly order from them again."
5,"Walt Whitman is a talented, visionary writer!","This book is highly entertaining and quaint, and it also teaches acceptance and peace through example. With views that even today are still evolving in America, Whitman almost seems to have written this book in 2050, and just slipped it back in time for us to read now."
5,a must !,For the blues lovers! She recorded almost all of the songs at her place! That's true blues!
4,Good Characters...,"This book has intrigue, romance, and suspense, and while I liked the characters, I found the plot to be a little mundane. I didn't really like the advice Kim's mother gave her, I just didn't buy it, and I didn't like WHEN the mother gave it to her. Couldn't she have talked 'sense' into Kim long before she was seconds away from the altar?"
5,I NEED THIS BOOK !!!!!!!!!!,"Hello to everybody,Where I could find this book please???Thank youMarcello"
4,its a great help,"ive been reading the book and it is a really big help, even to make you feel not that nervous about the exam!.Got a lot of tips and tactics for all question types and a complete answer information. Im glad i bought it!"
3,"Fabulous, if you never need to look anything up.","The order in which material is introduced is fine and the examples and explanations are good. However, except for the wonderful charts in the last two pages of the book, this book is about as poorly organized for finding anything as a book can be. If you have a photographic memory and never need to look anything up, this book is fabulous. But if you need to find something - the meaning of a word or a rule of grammar - plan on looking in three or four places. And don't count on finding the word your looking for in the glossary. For example, there in no mention in the glossary of the word ""when."" This isn't a bad book, but unfortunately it is frequently a frustrating one."
3,Helpful but confused,"I am a native Russian speaker and have helped teach college-level beginning Russian with this book's help. My major complaint is that food, clothing and body parts--essential basics for communication--are left out for the better part of the book. Otherwise, it's a satisfactory textbook, but I would not use it again."
1,Poor Quality,"After assembling the lamp I noticed that the surface of the stainless base was a little wavy. What I didn't know that the bottom was not manufactured properly and that it had a sharp edge that scratched the top of the new wood table I set it on. Obviously, it wasn't inspected before shipping."
1,Don't waste your time,"I was extremely disappointed with this purchase. While the software download was very affordable, I found it to be completely worthless and a waste of the $7 I paid for it. I was hoping to be able to create Christmas cards and calendars with this program and was not able to do either. The selection of Christmas images was very limited and amateur and the calendar selection ended with the year 2010! I will be uninstalling this program; what a waste."
1,I Want a Refund!,I was unable to burn a DVD of my slide show using this PhotoStudio Expressions. I was very disappointed since the slide show was to be used at a conference. What do I need to do to get a refund!!!!
2,jewatso,This software is not very intuitive. Very hard to use and get the results that you want. I would not recommend this software to a beginner.
2,Nothing Special,Nothing in this program stands out to make it any better then the software that comes with a new camera. It's lacks most of the functions of the photo software built into Windows 7 and is not worth taking up the space on a computer hard drive.Any old copy of Photoshop Elements or Microsoft Picture It is a much better program with more features and an easier user interface. My kids were looking for more then this program supplied. I should have read further to see if all the features they wanted were available here.
1,P-U READ IF YOU NEED A CALENDAR,"I now see that I should have read the reviews better. I wanted a calendar program that I could print pictures with. This to keep a feeding schedule for a King and Milk snake. Calendar ended in 2010. Complained by email and was told: ""tough, the rest of it works"". Hey, it may do photo editing great for all I know but that came free with my camera."
2,Similar to a cheese plane,"For some types of cheese, this ""plane"" may work well. Certainly the Profi looks great, is constructed of high quality materials, and has perfect size and heft. But the engineering of the plane is not perfectly level. This imperfection makes it difficult (or impossible) to slice some crumbly cheddars that I prefer. Works well for some kinds of cheese, but not for all."
2,What? Very incomplete...,"Sure, there is plenty about the early life of David Copperfiled in the 19th Century, but nothing about how he used his magic to transport himself to the 20th century where he became the greatest entertainer/magician of all time! Not even a single mention of the Statue of Liberty disapearring..."
1,The Good Old Days!,"Pseudo-scientific drivel. Live like the good old days - when half of children died before reaching adulthood. I'll put my faith in science, thank you."
1,Amateurish,"This guy simply does not know what he's talking about. Having read some of the scientific articles the author sites, I am disgusted with his lack of comprehension. Like other conspiracy theorists, he takes a few out of context factoids and stretches them to fit his ideas."
5,Great,I cannot recommend this book enough. Very well researched and written. Dr. Neustaedter is a true advocate for children.
2,Not biased? Come on!,"One only has to read about a dozen pages of this book to realize that it his heavily biased against vaccination. Almost every page in this book has something negative to say about vaccination despite the overwhelming evidence of the many benefits. People are free to make their own choices, but relying on others being imune to disease because their are vaccinated as an excuse not to get shots will only last so long... At some point, as these proponents of no vaccination grow in number they will see someone close to them get ill or worse die because of their lack of foresight.I strongly recommend reading up on the the myths and misconceptions of vaccination on the CDC or Health Canada website. They pretty much counter every argument found in this book."
5,A potent antidote for the complacent approach to living,"I felt from the beginning that I was there experiencing Admiral Byrd's journey into the outer reaches of our external (and internal) frontiers. I found myself reading some sentences over and over again as they were so poetically striking. How he and his associates expressed dignity and compassion in the face of extreme diversity is a lesson we should integrate into our daily lives. I recommend this book for ages 17 and beyond as a mandatory tool in character development. Written over 60 years ago, the themes are still timeless."
5,Fun for night time reading,I read this book in High School and I loved it then! Just a really great book.
1,Irratating prattle,"The review titled ""Alone"" with his ego - from 2003, said all there is to say about this book. Here is yet another man determined to do what ever crazy idea pops into his head, no matter what other people (or dogs) he has to hurt to do it."
5,The Whiner of the Antarctic,"Richard Byrd's book ""Alone"" captures the first-hand experience of an early but ill-equipped 'slacker' just hanging out, looking at the aurora australis, chippin on some doob and listening to some Wagner records with the wind rattling the stove pipe overhead for the 6 month austral winter.According to the book, Byrd got sick because the stove pipe was leaking and he freaked out and cried like a baby to come home after a couple months and then the radio broke and the rescue tractor broke and he cried some more and then they all got frost bite and saved him, then he cried some more and then he wrote the book.But now they built all these cool places where you can warm up, like apres-ski, and toke some chubba and do kool science.So it's not clear why Richard Byrd even wrote the book, since it's a real downer and he should have just, like, survived better and kept his gloves on.Sorry."
4,Fight For Survival,One mans quest for notoriety and fame almost brings about his demise. A good story of survival in the most harsh environment on earth. Giving you a history lesson in a riveting interesting way.
1,Cumbersome and uncomfortable,"I was really hoping this would work better than it does.I have been using a large changing bag for a couple years. I have started to get back into large format and the regular changing bag is a bit crowded - works OK for 6x7 and 35mm, but trying to load 4x5 film into a processing tank was a chore.What is wrong with this - your hands go right in the middle of the unit. May not seem like much, but you're forced to work with your arms extended uncomfortably high. Also becomes a problem trying to feel around the bottom of the bag.The metal hoops are oval shaped, so you only get about half the useable space that you'd think you'd get from looking at the picture. You don't have corners to put rectangularly shaped things in, so everything is pushed into the middle.It is light tight - no problems with fog the 2 times I've used it. It is well made, but I'm returning this and going back to the changing bag and waiting till it's night time to load my 4x5 tank."
2,Not Worth The Effort,"The book explores some aspects of lawyer marketing but the treatment is superficial at best. Sorry, but I did not find this book helpful"
1,Not marketing but selling,This book is not about marketing strategies but instead a classic book about selling and prospecting. One marketing lesson to be learned though: Newer use false declarations and dont lie about your product.
1,"101 Marketing Strategies for Accounting, Law, Consulting, and Professional Services Firms",Was not happy with the book.Waste of my money
4,"Nice live album, and a fine career overview as well","As good as Phil Collins' solo albums can be, they often contain no small amount of ""filler"", and the slick, glossy production on records like ""Face Value"" and ""No Jacket Required"" makes them seem somewhat dated.But this live album remedies some of that. Although no-one can accuse Phil Collins' horn-laden pop music of being 'gritty', it nevertheless sounds a little more genuine and less over-produced, and the track list is very strong, including almost all of Collins' best songs from the 80s:The spooky ""In The Air Tonight"" is here, as is ""Take Me Home"", ""Separate Lives"", ""A Groovy Kind Of Love"" and several others.There is still too much synth on tracks like ""Against All Odds"" (an otherwise superb ballad) and ""One More Night"", but that's what Collins' music is like, and ""Serious Hits...Live"" remains a good, solid collection of adult pop songs."
5,Time machine for me!,Having seen this set of shows years ago in Denver I was pumped when I ran into it online. Sit back and enjoy this gem - if you grew through college in the 80's you will be transported back in time only coming back home when Phil asks - Awesome stuff.
1,Sucks!!!,"I'd give it 0 stars if I could, although it's small and black it is completely useless unless your directly in front of the Xbox and even then it's glitchy. I bought the actual Xbox remote the white one I don't believe it's made by MS but that one doesn't work any better I recomend stick with the controller or maybe the actual MS brand one works better"
4,Not bad for a follow up,"A very decent addition to my collection of Flash books. The first chapter on Site Design Principles was worth the price of the book alone. Although not definitively project based through all chapters (some are just a few steps), I picked up a lot of valuable techniques that I use in my own career now. Foundation Actionscript should definately be read before this one. I'm having good luck with the Friends of Ed series, hopefully they'll publish a book on Swift 3D next."
4,"Are you designer turned programmer, start here!","Keep in mind that Friends of Ed targets these books to designers, and that the books are written by both designers and programmers!(Programmers already know how to do this stuff, maybe just not in the flash environment.)So if you are a designer who doesn't have a programmer working the ActionScript side of flash for you, this book would be a great desktop reference to complete a range of flash projects!Also, While all sections are not perfectly written or perfectly coded the book is packed full of code and information for the person who is truly willing to put the time in and learn the many aspects of flash!"
2,Sloppy Work,"I have now a total of 5 Friends of Ed book on Flash, but I have been disappointed so much so that now I vow not to buy another one. It is simply getting too sloppy for my liking. Often, codes don't work, or work with errors, and explanations are inadequate. I bought Flash 5 Studio 2 years ago, and recently, I wanted to learn more about Flash and XML, and looked at its chapter 20. I followed the codes and in the end, found that they don't work. Then I downloaded their files on the friendsofed.com site, and still they don't work. When I read through the instructions carefully, I found that they missed out many vital points. They added new lines to an example, but did not tell you all the consequential changes needed to the old code to make it work. Very frustrating and a waste of time."
4,Rug,I recieved the rugs in a very short time and very happy with them. They are comfortable and warm to walk on.
2,Dull!,"Goldmark's Rustic Wedding Symphony is one of my favorite pieces. It is not a traditional symphony, more like a suite. But the music is simply gorgeous, especially the slow movement. Unfortunately, this recording is devoid of any energy or passion. It is simply a reading. I cannot imagine the work was actually performed prior to the recording. The marketplace price is okay but don't waste your money."
4,Folding top hat,"hat folded and worked perfectly but the edges of the hat were frayed, unfinished looking."
3,$ cant be beat,"look all you want, mens hat under ebay or hats are us this is a great value for the money"
1,WMF Profi Plus Stainless-Steel Cheese Slicer,I've been using this cheese slicer for almost a year now. I don't buy sliced cheese so I use it almost everyday. I will say that the tool itself is very solid and well built. However since I have been using this slicer I have broken the wire 7 times! Lucky for me I ordered 6 extra wires when I bought this slicer. I just reordered 12 more wires and have started looking for a better slicer. I hope I find one before I run out of wires.
1,Wire breaks on a regular basis,"I agree with the other reviews, its great but very expensive to run, the wire breaks often and at $10 for 3 its expensive. It appears the knots at the end of the wires undo rendering the wire useless. I have many WMF items and this is the only one I am dissapointed with."
2,I thought this one would last...,"I've been buying the cheap cheese slicers for years, but the last few of those haven't lasted long at all. So I decided this all stainless steel one for $20 would be my answer. The description also said ""replacement parts available"". Great! Where do you order them? I couldn't find them on Amazon, so assumed there would be an insert telling where to order wires... Wrong. Nothing came, but the slicer. So I am returning this cheese slicer. I gave it two stars because the concept is good..."
3,Interesting small B western,"The summary of the plot listed above is reasonably accurate. What makes this movie of interest now, at least to me, is the border part of Border Patrol. People simply riding up the a marker in the desert or a simple cross point for the official crossing spot. Don't know if it was accurate, but it sure is different from today! The story is a simple little one of taming the spoiled girl who gets herself in with a bad crowd. George O'Brien is a pleasant hero and Polly Ann Young, sister of Loretta Young, makes a good leading lady, enough charm to make her spoiled rich girl appealing rather than annoying. It's a small movie but a pleasant way to spend an hour if you are in the right mood."
3,Very American,"So many almost photographic pictures of shiny objects,fruits, flowers and too few real ""Discoveries"" I look forward to each new ""Splash"",but this one seemed just more of the same.The pictures using fluid inks and a looser style are fun, but please thinks of us non-Americans when you use brand names of materials like ""Yupo""plastic paper"
5,Rocky Top,This is the most Outstanding Game in the History of UT.A perfect ending to a perfect season. Thanks TennesseeStephen W. Spry
5,sexy little secret,"I forget how I discovered Desnuda. But I know I did so after Gianni Versace discontinued the original Versace scent, which I had worn for 20 years. Now I wear only Desnuda by Ungaro or The One by Dolce Gabana, and both are great. I find the Desnuda is slightly more nuanced and more on the oriental side. It's sexy, and I like the fact that very few people seem to know about the scent, nor do I ever see it advertised. Thus, I feel as if the fragrance is mine alone. I'm glad Amazon carries this."
4,interdisciplinary melville,"This book has been out for a few years and am finally getting around to reading it. I was quite impressed because of its ability to situate Melville in an interdisciplinary cultural context that includes architecture, political ortaory, ethnological debates, etc. It's a really helpful (though overpriced) volume in understanding antebellum narrative in light of vexing national questions."
4,If you're feeling blue,"Okay, let's get it out of the way- it's not as good as The Doctor Came At Dawn, but what is? If you've never heard Mr. Callahan before you need to take the following steps- remove all sharp objects from your reach; put on your headphones; enjoy!! This is music for the intellectual set. There are no sing along anthems here. Just sparse arrangments, obtuse (at times) lyrics and pure singer songwriter bliss. If you're a fan of Will Oldham (aka Palace Bros, Palace Music, Push, Bonnie Prince Billy) or of Chan ""Cat Power"" Marshall you'll definitely appreciate this album."
3,Somber stoner,These plaintive indie exercises connect a little better than other releases but are still too sleepily repetitive to elicit any real energy.
4,let smog come in,"Smog makes the kind of music that draws life like it is and he knows how to do it. This album is not much like the amazing 'red apple falls', it contains more elements of masterpiece 'wild love'. Knock knock has beautiful songs and contains some kind of unknown power.Songs like 'i could drive forever' with bill's adorable voice make this album to my soundtrack for 1999. Buy it and realize that smog in the air is the best for you!"
3,cold blooded old times is by far the best song,"An interesting album though 'cold blooded old times' is by far the best song in town this week. The other songs are still growing on me but again, I have bought a whole CD for one great song."
4,Magnificent work,"This is a beautiful and valuable book, exhaustive and informative. The dictionary's subject matter in itself is of course quite lovely. There's always a chance that a reference might be missing but for each one that's missing you'll certainly find a dozen others that even your wildest imagination could not place."
4,A wonderful book but...,"This is a wonderful vehicle for the imagination, but I hope the next edition includes Pooh's Hundred Acre Wood. How could the authors have missed this one? Perhaps a copyright issue?"
5,The Dictionary of Imaginary Places,I was very impressed with the condition of the book. It looked new. I received it in a very timely manner. I was impressed with the experience. thank you
4,A fun and interesting source,"I enjoyed ""The Dictionary of Imaginary Places"" very much, and found it an interesting source for maps and summarized information on fictional places. There were some places that I felt should have been mentioned in the Dictionary that weren't, although there are certainly a great number of entries already. One problem I have is that the map of Tolkien's Middle-Earth is not entirely faithful to the original (most likely due to the difference in page dimensions). On the whole, though, this is a wonderful book."
5,You can't get there from here.,"I first came upon this book during my studies of medieval travel literature in Oxford. It was a large, older, hard-bound edition, which gave the fantastic lands inside it almost a magical flavor. I knew then that I had to have a copy of my own.Though only a reference book, this book should be read as anything but. Each entry is a small vacation from this planet, to a place often eerily similar. The destinations described are gathered from throughout the world of fiction and make-believe. This compendium contains all the ""never-neverlands"" and the land of ""OZ"" and ""Xexotland"", complete with illustrations, yet fails to mention small things such as Massachusetts.The creators range from the medieval comic-grotesque to the latest political cynics of our day.As amusement and as a literary reference, this book is worth it."
2,Great until it broke,"This shaker works just great, with a proper seal between the two halves. Unfortunately, the glass broke very easily on mine. I didn't drop it on the floor or anything, but merely knocked it over on the granite counter. It shattered. This is unacceptable."
4,"Nice shaker, albeit overpriced...","A great Boston shaker, but I'm not sure what I had to spend $50 for a pint glass and a thin piece of stainless steel."
3,"Nice, but... wow, expensive","First, this is a nice-quality Boston shaker.But... any bar supply place will sell you a similar-quality 28 oz Boston shaker top (the metal cup) for $10, often less... and pint glasses (with no annoying printing on them) are $1.95 at any Crate and Barrel. The combination works just as well as this thing, and looks exactly the same (again, minus the printing on the glass), for a lot less money. I don't understand where the markup comes from."
3,"Entertaining,but not truthful","I enjoyed the video,but the story reminded me of the comic books that they used to advertise in. I enjoyed it,but I was hoping to see a more realistic biography that dealt with the man and not the advertising created myth."
3,Headblade,"I bought the headblade for my husband. He normally shaves his head with a disposable razor, resulting in cuts. Upon receiving the Headblade, he attempted to load it with a blade and the blade holder broke. It is very fragile, and loading the blade is difficult. We had to order another blade holder and wait for it to arrive. He has been using the Headblade for a few weeks now. At first he still cut himself, but over time has become more adept and the cuts have stopped."
3,Good for a safe shave,This was a neat way to shave my head. In using this product I found it seemed to take more time to get a close shave on my skull than just using a regular hand razor. I did feel like it was a safer alternative however.
3,HeadLess Blade Head,"I had a near-sighted Mohican barber named Quepeg in Syracuse NY usually shave my head with an old fashioned razor axe. Perfect. He eventually retired so I had to look for something else.I used this primarily for shaving my head, as it gives no room for fleas, ticks, protezoa, or miotianta to live in your hair. Hair is also a great fertilizer for Barbary plants so I was conducive to ecological demands placed upon me by my hippy girlfriend who is bald. I have a year's supply of Baby oil too, so I need to use it up with my bald head.That said, I cut myself to pieces each time I used it. I looked like a bloody head stump from a horror movie plus I got dizzy looking at the reverse angle in the mirror every time I tried to shave.Now I just settle for the electric buzzer, which leaves a bit of hair but it's safer, unless you do it while in the shower or in a lighting storm."
1,Bathroom looks like a murder scene,"Horrible,I have two nickle size chunks out of my head! Like many other reviews here I have shaved my head for 6+ years with no major nicks. One time with this; SLICED like a horror movie. Tried one other time and that time I stopped at one injury!!"
1,Just a Piece of junk!,Just a piece of junk that I foolishly paid over $ 12.00 for.It's tiny and that causes a control problem when you use it as directed by your instructions.The blade was cheap and dull.My sink water was so bloody you would think I was cleaning fish!The jell I was using was coming through A slot in the shaver which clogged up the shaver causing you to stop & clean it out. Just using the sink water to wash it off didn't always work. You had to wash it off under the spigot to clean off the blade & backed up shaving jell.I will probably throw mine in the trash & use my old razor.I will try another type of blade first before I throw it away.I would not recommend your product to anyone. On a scale of one to ten it's not even on the scale-000000!
