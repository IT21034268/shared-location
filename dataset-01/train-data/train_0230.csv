1,OH MY GOD!,"What were the directors thinking? This movie was so boring. We have already seen a couple of movies that's just like this like Jurassic Park, The Birds, and Godzilla. But why did they have to make another movie about Bats I mean that's so retarded. This movie wasn't that scary, there are some parts that are but the whole movie is just dumb. Poor, Lou Diamond Phillips he seemed pretty disappointed being in this film. He does a really great job in his old movies like Stand and Deliver and La Bamba but I thought he had terrible acting in this movie. I recommened that if ya'll hadn't seen this movie yet, DON'T! You will be very disappointed."
1,AAIGHT,when i saw this i did not think it would be so corny. i mostly thought it was funny i was laughing so much hey manny got any ketchup?
3,This is a must see,This is a grate movie. It was not all that scary only some parts where more then others. There is only like maby one or two good scary secens the rest or midly scary if not at all. The only thing I dont like is that the storyline was coping two movies BIRDS and DEEP BLUE SEA.
3,Give Bats a fair shake,"It's hardly a great film, but Bats manages to be fun and fairly exciting without insulting the viewer. The movie could have easily gone the horror-comedy route but is, thankfully, played straight. If you are interested enough to seek out a review of a movie called Bats then you probably won't be disappointed in the product. While I would never attempt to pronounce another persons opinion as incorrect the preceding reviews do contain some rather misleading information. Bats bears little resemblance to The Birds aside from the obvious fact that the antagonists of both films have wings. And the heroes most certainly do not simply ""turn on a cooling device, hop in their truck and drive home."" I won't give away the ending but it is certainly more involved than that. There is also a nifty parody on those lame ""Oh! The monster isn't really dead,"" endings we're all accustomed to. I'm looking forward to the director's commentary on the DVD release."
3,bats! you gotta love them,"hey who dosen't love bats? i do and i thought this movie was great. Get the dvd its much better then the tape, the dvd has more features and you can see the bats more better then on the tape"
1,Worst movie i ever saw.,"Bats, how many words are there to describe it.It was probably the worst movie i've ever seen next to Dudly Do-right. IT was a cheap rip off of of the movie ""the birds"" by alfred Hitchcock. The acting wasn't to bad but the story line on the other hand was the worst. The ending was stupid and there was no plot. They just ran around and did what ever, there really was not point except to get rid of the bats, some stuff was taken out of nowhere and just shoved into the movie. Well thanks."
2,"Bad bat, bad! (But fun...)","Scientist Sheila Casper (Dina Meyer) works in rural Texas with the local sheriff Emmett Kimsey (Lou Diamond Phillips, donning a drawl) to stop the spread of genetically mutated bats. Sheila is a bona fide bat-lover, so she does everything in her power to ensure the little bloodsuckers don't come to any harm - but the trigger-happy U.S. Army has very deadly plans for the winged menaces. A guilty pleasure... once.Staci Layne Wilson"
2,Hmm,"It should have been a decent B-grade horror movie. Unfortunately it does not even reach that far. It has an insane premise, no good dialog and even the special effects do not save this sheer waste."
1,BAD AT EVERYTHING!,"This is without a doubt putting ALL of the films even On Streaight to Video movies. This is by far the Worst film of 1999!the acting is horrorble, the premis is totally unorginal. the whole movie is Unorginal. Copys from just about all the blockbuster hits.ahhh horrorble movie, not even worth renting as far as I'm concered. frnakly I saw this in theaters. and it Wasn't worth the time. but I think amatures leave films.. I'm no amature so I didn't leave the film. fact is, if there was any film I would ahve walked out of that year. it would without a doubt be that one.One thing thats even worser is the fact they are ACTULLY planning Bats 2 now. It doesn't diserve a Sequel. and the cast didn't even deserve to be paid for this film."
2,Just Another Monster Movie Not Quiet Worth The Watch.,"Oh, no! Watch out for flying, rubber, killer bats! Ahhhh! Ahhhh! Basically, if you ask me, these bat effects in this movie were totally bogus. They had the face of Spielberg's gremilins, (or so when they have water spilled onto them). It's like, they can't think of anything more origianl. This movie is about a mad scientist, whose experiments with bats goes horribly wrong--(like in most monster movies you see now days). So the bats get bigger and bigger and bigger...Until they escape and start attacking the town. Bats is somewhat in relation to Alfred Hitchock's The Birds. Only with qiant killer bats, that is. This movie has chessy special effects, and just not worth watching again. This movie was just ten years too late in the making."
2,B grade monster movie gets a D from me,"I had read so many bad reviews for this low budget mutant-monster-run-amok movie that I went in expecting to loathe every second of it. To my surprise I found myself liking it in a so bad its kind of okay way. This movie is nothing classic, not even on the camp level. The attack scenes are handled with incredible sloppiness and the bats themselves are not particularly realistic. The director has a better furture with music videos than with horror films. Not worth the effort to rent, much less buy."
2,BATS ARE NOT THAT SCARY,"Bats are not really that scary anyway so I don't see whats the big deal. If they wanted to they could make this same movie with birds or roaches, but the point is that theres not much to it."
4,Where Do You Hide When The Dark is Alive?,"'Bats', a stylish, campy, horror flick, has all the makings of a B grade movie: average acting, pretty decent effects, and a fairly good plot (filled with good, intense suspense & a few clever plot twists). It's good for a few laughs & quite a few scares!"
3,A GOOD BOOK TO THE FINISH!!!,"I loved this book eventhough Manitou was better. This book is great for true horror readers. I have read a couple of Masterton's books and though this is not one of the better, it is still a good story from the Master of Horror!!"
3,Not His Best,"While the songs on You Gotta Problem with Me are tighter than recent indulgences, the lack of a real drummer makes for a drab album. Most songs sound like demos. There is nothing nearly as good as East Easy Rider, Leperskin, I Come From Another Planet Baby, Try Try Try or even Fear Loves This Place.The total time for both discs is only 56:46. There is no reason why this music cannot be on one CD.If new to Julian H Cope, start with Peggy Suicide instead. Then try Interpreter or Jehovahkill.[DW]"
2,"Works, but shoddy design","This works well, but the keyring breaks. If you can't take the thing with you because you are afraid it will fall off, it sorts of defeats the purpose, don't you think? Get another USB drive with the keyring built into the drive end, so if the cap slips off--which it can do--you haven't lost the drive, just the cap. I can't imagine why Memorex would design it this way.Still the drive works fine. It just has to serve as a local transport from a laptop to a desktop. Bummer."
1,Slow and Cheaply made,"This drive is so not worth it. It is slow, compared to the Lexar Jump drive or the sandisk products. It is cheaply made. Looks like something you would get at a Toy Vending machine..Save your money and buy something else"
2,NOTE TO SELF...,"Just a warning to other potential purchasers - this product is NOT water-proof. I went swimming with my Flash Drive and to my surprise, it shorted out - now I can't get it to work!"
3,"Very decent product, poor cap design","The keychain portion of my thumbdrive broke completely off after a mere 4 weeks of carrying it around on my keychain. There are other thumbdrives that have much sturdier cap designs, so if you are planning on attaching this to your keychain, you may consider shopping around some more and paying close attention to ergonomics.Aside from the brittle cap loop, the drive works great and i'm happy with its performance."
4,"Great drive, wish the drive were attached to the lanyard, rather than the cap","I've had this USB drive for about a month and It's been terrific. I haven't noticed any speed issues, but I'm basically managing small files. I've had no trouble with it in Windows 2000, OS X and FreeBSD. My only complaint is that the cap is attached to the lanyard, not the drive itself. I can easily forsee a time when I reach for the drive and find that it has come unattached somewhere. This seems poinless to me, as there's a nice little latch on the lanyard to disconnect the CAP from the lanyard. If I'd looked more closely at the photos, I'd have figured this out. Still, I have no regrets!"
1,crappy,I use this type of flash drive for my research and more than half the time I can never view the images on the computer or get the flash drive to work....not worth buying
1,Slow as molasses,"The ergonomics are good - nice rubber grip, small, keychain ring. It's all downhill after that. I use You Synchronize to keep files current between my laptop at school and my G5 desktop at home. After using the Memorex I bought the SanDisk Cruzer Titanium 512MB, advertised as 3x faster than most thumb drives. Here are my results timing the read time on the same synch with the same files on my desktop with both:Memorex=2minutes 4 secondsSD Titanium=9.3 secondsI guess I'm stuck with the Memorex, as it isn't the seller's fault it's a pig, but my advice is DON'T BUY IT unless speed is NO concern to you. If you don't absolutely have to have 1GB, get the Titanium."
2,No Warranty service,"I have to agree with some of the previous reviews, Cheap outer case and it is slower than SanDisk. But the real kicker is that Memorex does not back up it's so called 1 year warranty. I had a bad USB port fry my flash drive. Sent it to Memorex via instructions emailed to me. Almost 4 months later and a half dozen warranty inquiries, still no replaced Flash Drive. My recommendation, buy a SanDisk."
5,Write-protect is a Plus,"Overall, excellent product.Speed is slows down with very large files, but generally no problem.Especially I like the easy-to-use write-protect switch. In fact, I wouldn't buy a USB flash drive without the switch.Linux ""Live"" distrobutions will run from this device. Copy your favorite flavor (Knoppix, PCLinuxOS, Slax, Kanotix all work) to the flash pen and run from there. This is better, speed wise, than running from the CD, but has all the advantages of a Live CD-based OS. Considering the amount of compression to fit all those applications in 700MB, you'd think that applications would run slowly, but they run quick.If you consider yourself moderately adept with Linux, make two partitions on this drive. Copy Live Linux to the big partition. Set up your configuration, templates and such, and save on the small partition. Flip the write protect switch. Now you have a custom configured, fast, totally rock solid and absolutely secure OS."
2,Good drive but fragile key ring and bad customer service,"I purchased this 7-8 months back and am happy with it for most part. Didn't have any formatting problems as some of the others, but the key hole is fragile and broke off. You can probably buy this thing, but be extra nice and careful with the cap.And be careful if you have Memorex rebates. They ate away a $20 mail-in-rebate which was offered with the purchase. I called the customer service multiple times and each time, they made it harder to get the rebate - I ultimately gave up and feel cheated."
5,EE/amateur,This was probably my favorite book as a child. I am sure I checked it out of the library more than anyone else. Amazon should be rewarded for making it easier to find any book at a reasonable price. More than any thing else it was responsible for my lifelong career and avocation. The book was in excellent condition and a fair price with great service from the seller.
4,great strong brace,Easy to use and very strong. We used it to hold up a heavy butcher block top attached to a wall.
2,NO IDEAS FOR SMALL BUDGETS,"The photos in this book are well done, but there are not many of them. There is no how-to advice This book has alot in common with ""This Old House"" a show I can only watch a few minutes at a time. Both cater to the elites who would say ""I was going to throw this two hundred grand in the sewer, but the Old House crew will build me a salvaged Brazilian Wormwood floor. Great!""If you are budget conscious, you know you are in trouble with this book when the author starts off with a actor's home."
2,Judging an elephant from its foot,To say that you know the entire marketing field having just advertising knowledge is akin to only managing to see the foot of an elephant and knowing the whole.
4,Smartly Designed Reissues of Wodehouse Classics,"This was my introduction to Wodehouse, and I'm sure I'll come back for more. Clever and witty, the book about the soul switching between an English aristocrat, and a bratty Hollywood child star is something straight out of the movie world it pokes fun at.Wodehouse throws in plenty of funny and colorful characters while tying up plot points in neat little bows by the end.It should also be mentioned that the newly designed editions by Overlook Press are beautiful, compact, and a must have for collectors."
3,Ok game for older children,"This game is more fun if you have at least 3 players. Younger players (9 and below) will have a hard time competing, even if they are using the younger rules. It's a little bit of a challenge to remember the three definitions...writing them down is kind of time consuming.We had a good time playing the game, but it's not one that we would pull out of the cabinet first."
5,A unexpected surprize,I was buying this book for a dear friend and decided to read it first before giving it to her. This book was such a quick read.I could'nt seem to put it down. It was light hearted and funny at times and deep and introspective at others. This is a great book about friendship and how it affects our lives.I really enjoyed this book. At times I was laughing out loud.I know my best friend will enjoy it too.
4,Lovely little book,As a living history actor I enjoy having as much little pieces of information to go with the larger picture of my character and the time. This is a lovely book for that cause and it came in fine condition and good time.
1,Sony Style no longer.,"This is definitely a good product, the video quality is good but the low light has made shooting at nights a little less worthy. But that's not what I'm going to share today.I've purchase this on 2nd April, 2007. Today its August 12th and this camera is already spoilt. Yes SPOILT. The screen is black, only able to see slight silloette, and the power shuts down abruptly.This started yesterday and when I did not open the screen fully, the color was still alright.I believe its the connection between the flap which is causing this problem, but this shouldn't happen. Especially when you've purchase this in USA and stationed abroad.I'm not too pleased with the after support either. I'm very dissapointed with the outcome. Maybe mine was a bad apple in the batch. This product is clear of any falls or external influnced such as heat etc but Sony failed.But it still breaks down. That my friend, is not worth the hassle. Sony's products has always been up to standard until now."
3,Great camera when it works,"We bought this camera right when it came out in spring of 2007. It worked great for a little over a year. We loved having both a digital camera and a camcorder in one small camea. After the warrantee ran out we started having problems. First the LCD screen stopped working because the connection had cracked. We hadn't dropped it or anything. After paying lots of money to get that repaired, it worked well for another couple months and then something with the lens stopped working and it was all black. We sent it for repair again and dumped more money into it. We've had it back a couple weeks and now the docking station isn't working. Again, we didn't drop it or anything. It worked one day and didn't the next. So now I can't get the images off the camera. Very disappointed with Sony on this product. Next time I will definately buy an extended warrantee."
5,Good image in poor light conditions,"I'm using my camera to record a festival in the night, and the quality of the image is excelent. It has low level noise and a very detalis scenes."
2,too big of battery,I just got this and returned it the next day. Main reason is that the battery sticks out like soar thumb. The video and still picture quality is great however I could not get over the look and feel of the camcorder .
1,Poor Video Quality,"I bought this Camcorder from Amazon 2 months back and I am not happy with my purchase. Sony should make camcorders with Good video quality, they should understand camcorders are for shooting videos and not still picture. Sony added lot of good features with this camcorder but the video/picture quality is the worst. Daylight out door videos has come out with average quality. The indoor low light videos are very grainy. You can't do much with the software which comes with the camcorder. The one touch burn will work only for once for a specific video clip.I had taken this to India during my vacation otherwise I would have returned it. I strongly advice every one not to buy this product. It is not worth paying around 800$ for this camcorder. I have used old mini DV camcorders 5 years back with better picture quality and with time sony should improve its technology to offer camcorders with better video quality especially the low light performance."
1,broke in two years of usage :(,"I'm giving one star for this product because it was doing very well until it's LCD screan broke with only two years, and with not that much of a usage.I got very disappointed with this product because when I bought a Camera it was to use it for about five years. The LCD screan stopped working in a sudden while I was downloading videos to my computer. I tried to call the customer support and they told me the only thing they can do is to fix it with the cost of 175 dollars plus shipping. I guess I might as well buy another one from a different brand, because I won't be risking another disappontment."
2,nice pictures but delicate camera!,"Pros: Easy to use, great picturesCons: over 3000 meters (9800 feet) can ruin camera. Can't drive the freeway west of Denver!! Owners manual is poor. Camera has no external microphone jack. Can't film from an airplane in turbulence or from a vehicle on a rough road without potentially damaging hard drive.If all you want is to shoot lots of video around home, this is a great camera. However, it is not for the serious outdoors person, and none of the reviews I read talked about that before I bought the camera. Also, there is no map of the features in the owners manual. It has the picture and numbers, but no description! You have to search through the pages to find where that number is discussed."
3,TriWizard Cup,"I purchased this lamp for my daughter for Christmas, as she is a Harry Potter fanatic, as am I. I was expecting something larger and more solid. I don't feel the price should have been so high, but when you have a Potter maniac like I have for a daughter, it was worth the look on her face when she opened it. I do not consider this item a toy."
3,Okay but not a great lens,"I rented this lens for a weekend and found that the focusing on this lens was extremely disappointing in low light.Compared to the 35-10mm f2.0 I felt like I was using a f4 lens and even using the focusing limiter switch found it to hunt a lot.I am sure for outdoor use it is an excellent lens, especially for sports photography, but the pricepoint and indoor problems I experienced are reasons enough to not purchase this lens."
3,Wimped Out,"A pity that the movie wasn't filmed as it should have been. Someone said it's a slap in the face to Anne Rice, who's novel was made into a joke with this movie. I strongly agree.However, it's worth watching--though I roll my eyes through a lot of it thanks to the comedic parts. The book was not written as a comedy, and it shows in this film. A pity the director didn't have the guts to do this film the way the book was written.I strongly suggest to those who enjoy the theme of this movie to go buy the book. Anne Rice's Sleeping Beauty series (written as A. N. Roquelaure) is an incredible read--better then Exit to Eden."
5,Nice Comedy,"The best kinda comedy. Make fun of sex, even the wierd stuff? Who better than Rosie? That and there were some good looking ladies with itty bitty clothes."
5,I love the honesty displayed in this movie,"One of the first movies to Dispute the myths about about bondage. Its about trust. All in all ""exit to eden"" does a good job of displaying an alternative lifestyle. And it does it with a fair amount of humor. If you are unacostumed to viewing things from other points of view, aside from your own, then do not watch this movie. However if you like to explore other lifestyles, and get a good laugh while your at it then this is a good movie to watch."
2,Hummmmmmm!,"Only bought it because it has Stuart Wilson in it. He always makes the movie better! I thought it was rather ridiculous and if it had not been for Rosie O'Donnell, I didn't know she was in it, and Stuart Wilson, I would have given it a ""1""."
3,Good clean fun,"I found the entire concept funny; whether intentional or not, this movie does have some gags going for it, thanks to O'Donnell's wisecracks, Ackroyd's visual hamming, and the situational humor. I was pleased to see that it doesn't take itself as seriously (all the time) as some viewers expected. Lighten up, y'all! Equating a fairly mild fetish (at least as presented here, with glamourized sugar-coating and wink-wink-nudge-nudge abounding) with a serious ""Alternative Lifestyle Choice"" is just pompous. Maybe some people need to get over their preoccupations with their lower chakras? And speaking of which, any movie with the lovely Dana Delany au naturel automatically gains an extra star. Maybe two."
3,Pretty Good,"This movie was different. Is that good, you may ask? I think so. I've never seen a movie similar to it. I actually thought Rosie and Dan's dry sense of humor worked. I fell for it hook, line, and sinker. There is a lot of nudity, so PLEASE do not let the children walk in while you're watching. It had a good bit of romance and that was the lovely part. You have Dan, who was scared of sex, and after viewing the goings-on at Eden, decides to step up his game, so to speak. This is a good movie in my opinion and I think anyone who has an OPEN MIND going into the viewing will enjoy it! Thanx!"
1,Worst movie ever,"Great book, horrible movie. The casting director did a terrible job. The script writer obviously didn't read the book. In the immortal words of Comic Book Guy ""Worst Movie Ever""."
1,NIGHTMARE!!!,"Rosie ""Oh! Donnel"" as a dominatrix! She should be speaking out against THIS garbage and save her pious, self righteous anti-gun hostility for the directors who produce this kind of ""entertainment"". Rosie may do good things for kids, but this ""movie"" was certainly was not one of those things!"
1,When this movie comes on......RUN!!!!!,"Rosie O Donnell running around in black leather and fishnets is not my idea of entertainment. First she had to ruin every man's Betty Rubble fantasy, and now this. Rosie stick to day-time TV so people who work for a living will never have to see you and your big basketball head."
1,This film is pathetic!,Dan Ackroyd & Rosie o Donnell of all people took part in this shameless film about two undercover cops who travel to some sort of exotic lsland with it's inhabinets devoted to gratifying sadomacstic sexual fantasies. Unbelivably bad comedy that will make the viewer wanna make a head start towards the exit. This type of film will only appeal to people who have a sick and twisted personalty.
5,Big thanks to the seller,"The movie was not damaged and functioned well for a VHS. I really like the movie, it is a good romantic/humorous movie."
4,Exit to Eden,"One of my old favorites from Cinemax, it was something new and different back then. And it was funny to see Rosie O'Donnell play straight again."
3,light-hearted sexiness,"In no way is this a heavy or meaningful movie. Rather it is a great light-hearted exploration of a theme, replete with non-stop one-liners from a fun and talented cast. Dana Delany exudes a refined yet casual sexuality that I find irresistible. Favorite [paraphrased] quote of the movie:A male character lusting after Rosie O'Donnell: ""I'd like to make your wildest fantasy come true!""Rosie: ""Yeah? Paint my house!"""
1,Insult to Rice and BDSM,"I am personally insulted that Anne Rice's book was butchered into some schlocky/comedy/keystone cop caper movie this way. This film insults those of us who live (and rather enjoy) the BDSM lifestyle. The overly glib explanation of the male leads bondage fascination was extremely insulting, spankings from a busty maid indeed. Believe me, this fascination with pain and servitude goes much deeper than that; it can't be so glibbly and easily glossed over as the film does.I would have given this film negative stars if it were a possibility. Garry Marshall should be flogged for making this film, and who in the name of all things sacred and profane wants to see the Golden Heifer herself in leather?"
1,I bought this for a friend,This movie sucks! What a waste.I really did buy this for a verry dear friend....I now question her tastes at every opportunity.....
4,Great movie but I wish it was available new on DVD!,The critics didn't like this movie but I did. The actors all offered very solid performances and the movie was very funny. And the concept was great - especially in our politically correct to the point of being pointless and annoying world. I hope the studio re-releases this one! I'd love to buy it but not for the prices they've listed for the used version.
4,A Fierce Young Voice,"Claire Messud's THE HUNTED is surprising work, and what most surprises is that this young writer has mastered a demanding literary form, the nouvella. In ""A Simple Tale"" she enters the mind of a World War II survivor of Hitler's labor camps and traces this woman's consciousness from youth to her older years as a Toronto cleaning woman. All of the characters in this nouvella are fully fleshed out and thoroughly interesting. ""The Hunters"" is set in contemporary London and deals with the psychology of fear and suggestibility. To say that it is a contemporary take on James'""The Turn of the Screw"" is to suggest its creepiness and fascination. not to dismiss the nouvella as trite hommage. The book is a double dose of adventurous thinking and accomplished writing from a writer who has found her voice at a very young age. Highly recommended."
3,"Very good, but....","Not as good as ""The Last Life"", which is so far Claire Messud's masterpiece. I love her fuid, romantic language that effortlessly transports you to her worlds, and it works well in these two novellas; however, there is an emotional hole in these stories that was not present in her other work. I did not feel a connection to any of the characters as I did in her previous full-length books and I don't know if it's because the stories did not have a middle ""arc"" or perhaps Messud is at her best when she is allowed to draw her characters out over several chapters. I enjoyed the stories for what they were but they left no lasting impression on me the way Sagesse from ""Last Life"" did, nor did they offer any new observations on the human psyche that she hasn't already explored. Still, even Messud's disappointments are never fully ""disappointing"" and I would recommend this book for a satisfying weekend read."
1,Huge disappointment,"What happened? Her previous book, ""The Last Life,"" was terrific. The two short novels in this [price] book (big type, too) are awful. They read like five-finger exercises at a third-rate MFA program -- all characterization, no action or development. Omit, but buy The Last Life -- it's great. Hope the author's next will return to her previous level of excellence."
5,If you missed this one . . .,"I see that this album is no longer available. Just wanted to extend my condolences to those who may have missed it. It's a lot of fun. Innovative, upbeat, optimistic, even liberating. But what else would you expect from a great South African band?! My advice: Keep trying to find it!"
5,An Old Favorite,"I love this one! Poor Harry doesn't like the roses on his new sweater from Grandma. He keeps trying (and failing) to ""lose"" it, and becomes depressed. His mood is saved by a bird that swoops in to unravel the sweater for a nest - and Grandma sends Harry a new, better sweater in the end, so everyone winds up happy. Great muted colors and ""retro""-style illustrations, too."
4,A very original story line of a dogs dilemma.,I remember this story fondly from my own childhood. The different strategies that Harry tries to rid himself of the sweater he does'nt like are still very amusing to me today. I'm going to share it with my classroom.
4,A Silly Dog,"In No Roses for Harry, Gene Zion is telling us that if you have a problem you have to try different ways to solve the problem. Harry was a schnauser with black and white spots on him. One day he got a present from Grandma, it was a sweater with roses on it and he does not like it. He tried to leave it lots of places but other people kept giving it back to him. Is he going to be able to get rid of it or will he have to keep it? You will have to read to find out....Rachel C."
5,Favourite childen's book,This book is available in Canada but often is sold out. I am in poor health and ordering from Amazon is so convenient for me. Thing always arrive quickly and in good shape. This was no exception. Thank you!
2,No Roses for Harry! - not what I was expecting,"I was very disappointed with this purchase. Whilst the story and illustrations are exactly as I remembered them from my childhood, I was upset about the particular edition that I received. I was expecting a much larger book in a different format. I purchased Harry the Dirty Dog at the same time as I made this purchase and it came to me in the format I was expecting - gorgeous. Perhaps I did not read the description well enough - but it certainly was not made clear in the photo of the product."
3,"Step in the right direction, but loose the raps.","""Boy"" was a good single for her and the video did well on MTV, but no one is yet treating her as seriously as they used to. She needs to loose all the rappers. While I am a huge Hip-Hop fan, she needs to realize she is not Ashanti (very mediocore), Beyonce, Mya or Nivea. She is a distinguished, multi-platnum selling diva. I mean, listen to Celine and Whitney's recent albums and then listen to ""Boy""! Mariah needs more mature efforts. I do give her props for effectively mixing Cam'rons hit last summer with her tight R&B grooves. However, ""Boy"" doesnt live up to the ""Fantasy"" Remix with ODB or ""Sweetheart"" with JD. Get her earlier stuff instead."
2,"Dance Mariah, Dance","Theer is sometimes where an danced up version of a song, or the actual song can not seem to show the true taste of the talent of the artist. In the case of Mariah Carey, she seemed to have it all wrapped all over again. After her tragic breakdown and gossip columns budging, she was ready. Too bad I wish I could say the same thing about the song. As for the most recent song, Boy (I need you), the song really doesn't seem to live to those expectations you'd see from Mariah. Although it seemed easy to catch at first, it stood still and fell down after the second listen. Still, I think that Mariah should try to go back to those ballads soon, like she did with Through The Rain. Maybe people should be reminded of that reason Mariah made it after all, not here."
5,"LAURA, LAURA, LAURA PAUSINI","WHAT CAN I SAY ABOUT HER? ABOUT THIS ALBUM? FREAKING AWESOME AND POWERFUL, PERIOD. LAURA AND THIS CD ARE THE GREATEST GIFTS, EVER! THROUGH HER MUSIC, SHE HAS HELPED ME IN SO MANY WAYS. SHE IS THE BEST!"
4,one of the best Laura Pausini,Laura's performence is very good in this album...songs are chosen very well too..if you like italian music you have to buy it..
5,Brilliant,"Laura is absolutely brilliant with this latest CD. Her voice is beautiful no matter what she sings, but I do prefer her singing in Italian than English. Tu sei bravissima Laura! Sara' interessante se tu e Eros facciate un ""duet""."
2,Blue spray for green grass?,"Perhaps I'm using it for the wrong type of application, but I found this product to be very ineffective. When purchasing this item, my intention was to spray an herbicide and sufactant over my lawn and mix in this product to tell where I sprayed. I mixed the solution based on the label's recommendation, and I couldn't see the blue color on my dark green grass. This product may work well for fairways or greens on golf courses where the grass is cut very short; but for residential use, it gets lost in the taller grass. It would be much more effective if it was white instead of blue."
5,I like these!,"I bought these from our local health food store (much more expensive...) when I was battling w/mastitis for the 2nd time in a month. These, in combination w/cabbage leaves :) and lots of vitamin C, worked beautifully. I take them to maintain my health in this regard. I do not want to be w/o them! Hope they work for you as well as they have for me. Additionally, I have used many brands of probiotics and was skeptical of these in the beginning."
1,Does not work like probioitcs should,"I tried swithing to this product as an experiment but it backfired. I have used enough probioics products to know that it should calm my IBS symptoms and I should have less cramping and gas.HOWEVER, this product has almost zero effect on me. I dont think it is very good quality. They refused to refund my money also. I am very disappointed and going back to my old brand since it works."
1,Did not work like the others,I did not have luck with this product and my intestinal cramping came back when I stopped my other brand and started using these. I tried them for about 2 weeks and then finally gave up.
2,Rabbit food,"The pills that these probiotics come in are huge. They are about the same size as my fish oil pills. The smell is akin to rabbit food and leaves a nasty after-taste in my throat. Although this is based in ""whole food"" as it does state, I'd rather go with a smaller pill that doesn't smell or give an after taste (I am sticking with Pearls)."
4,Food for thought,"...I found quite a few things to think about while reading this. Many of the guys I have dated make less than me, but (as the author points out) that doesn't make them losers. The author really makes you think about gender roles and gender bias and why women still define themselves through their husbands and consider themselves (and other women) failures if they're not married. Could I handle having to ask someone for money? Could I handle being the primary or sole breadwinner? Could I handle not being the primary care-giver for children? These things - and a few others - are things I really hadn't given a lot of thought to before, but will now."
1,Needs a different title,"This book is lame. And almost funny in its message of an unmarried woman is a failure. Chapter 14, Can You Marry a Man Who Makes Less?I am still laughing at the description Mzzzz. Minetor gives at about how one might react to marrying a poorer man.Whine, nag, moan, and groan.This is ""The Rules"" - remember them? - and the only thing missing is how to get an Underachiever to get down on his knee and beg ya to marry him, as he holds out a Diamond Ring - hopefully bought from a pawn shop."
1,Very Disappointing,Vastly inferior to the 1985 edition. Usually a book has more information in the 2nd edition. This has MUCH less. Huge sections of the background information have been removed. Does the author think this makes the book MORE comprehensible?
5,Pretty much the edition to get.,"A superior edition to the old Recinos/Goetz/Morley version. Just a fine read for anyone interested in Mesoamerican prehistory or world religions in general. My only beef is the lack of information in the introduction, which is mostly just a summary of the Popol Vuh itself, which you bought the book to read anyway. The footnotes involve a lot of page-flipping, but are very insightful and informative."
1,no good for my needs in lighting,"I was very disappointed in these bulbs they were not only very dim and barely lit up my tank, but they created so much heat that my tank temperature rose 5 degrees when they were on! I found other company's here on amazon that sell colored compact fluorescent bulbs which give more lighting, and use the same wattage of power and create zero heat! I suggest anyone who has problems like me using white light which causes a fungal growth in your tank, to try these colored compact fluorescent bulbs! They work for me, no fungal growth and awesome color, I chose the black lights and have a cool purple tank now!"
3,Not bright enough..,I bought these to replace the factory bulbs that came in my 10g tank. They are just not bright enough to light the tank well.
1,Glo Light? What light?,"Wow, these have no light at all and as another reviewer said it makes my tank look maroon and gloomy. Not the ""glo"" I was hoping for!! Do not buy!!"
1,very disappointed,The bulb blew seconds after it was installed and turned on! I am NOT HAPPY! I will not be using this brand again.
3,Modern Japanese,I used this book for a couple of weeks until my sensei changed the texts while I was in Japan. This is a good self learning though and I intend to pick it back up eventually.
1,It was Defective because it leaks gas!,"It was ok during the first fill with carbon dioxide. However, when I tried to refill it, it started leaking gas and became unusable. I am going to ask company to replace it or refund the full amount.Thanks,AM"
1,Armchair Hack,"Wow. Don't know what to say about this crusty old chump's travel book. So he does some travelin' and then writes about it so you can read it and not do it. Pretend to travel? Simulate doing something while never leaving your house?? Sound like something he hates? Oh yeah, smack, knocked up teens, video games."
1,Worthless rantings of a bigot,"Don't buy this man's books.Don't subsidize his mad rantings, or his old-school bigotryand prejudice.I don't know what kind of travel writer he is, but I do knowthat he has nothing to offer we reasonable, open-minded human beings."
1,Caveat Lector,"I don't usually write negative reviews for literature, since a large part of what you enjoy about the written word is subjective. However, I take travel writing as an exception.Sub-par travel literature is inherently dangerous to read, especially for the novice globetrotter. Whittell's books on Central Asia have been a great way to get yourself hurt far away from home. Please do yourself a favor and DO NOT pick this book up when you see it.The Library Journal mentions something about this area of the world being previously inaccessible to western travelers. They must've gotten this mixed up with East Germany, because I've had several absent-minded professors meander their way through the same locations as Whittell (in the early 90's) with half the trouble and none of the bad advice. Find yourself something better to read, even if you're an ""armchair traveler.""There is one positive lesson to take from this book. Don't stop writing. If this guy can get published, anyone can."
1,Please don't take advice from Loonies,After taking this guys advice we were attacked by Mongols and my wife barely managed to escape. I'd say his book rates right up there with teen pregnancy and heroin...stay away.
1,whittell is out of touch,"whittell is completely out of touch with the world around him, bitter and extremely opinionated while being uninformed. He should be reading books, not writing them."
4,igo tip review,works perfect... better price would be good. this tip is also available in other numbers. one of which i already had. IGO needs to show all tip #S available for a certain product.
4,Pleased...,"I'm happy with the igo auto charger and this tip that fits my cell phone. Delivery was fast, product was packed well, and it works perfectly."
5,Even better than the Myers-Briggs,"I love this profile. The DISC styles are so easy to understand and apply. Understanding yourself is powerful...but the DISC framework makes it simple to read others and adapt behaviors accordingly. I use these insights all of the time, whether I'm at work or with my family. I highly recommend this tool!"
2,Can't go along with the rest of you....,"As an 80's rock collector (melodic, hard, idiotic, and otherwise), I have to say I was disapponted upon receiving this cd. I gave it a few months before my review, but I can't say it's anything special. Any comparison to Kansas or especially House of Shakira is unwarranted. Quite simply, this cd is lacking in memorable riffs or choruses. Much of it sounds esentially the same, and there's not much variance in the vocals. My review leans towards 2 1/2 stars, but I can't do any better. I know most of you won't agree with me, but that's ok. That's why we all have different ears. This just didn't do it for me."
2,Dated information,"Not the book and information I was looking for, considering it was written 20 plus years ago and not relevant to getting into t.v. commercials today."
3,Over rated and under whelming,"First it doesn't ""spray"" it sort of blobs onto clothing and you have to rub it into the stain. Second it is less effective than just making a paste out of tide and doing the same thing. If you don't want to mix your detergent into a paste so you save 30 seconds by rubbing the foamy blobs into the stains it might be worth the effort.Perhaps a spray nozzle that is adjustable would make it a better value, but since it only has one setting, the blob setting, its more annoying than effective."
3,"Tom Selleck good, script bad",Tom Selleck is just right as Jesse Stone. The problem with this (and most of the other movies based on the Jesse Stone books) lies in the script. Odd changes that make no sense at all and really detract from the overall quality of the movie.
4,Good Stories made into Good Movies,"I have read and enjoyed every book Robert Parker wrote in the Jesse Stone series and tripped across one of the movies on cable one night. I then searched out the entire series of movies, some from my local library and the ones I couldn't find there I got from Amazon. Selleck does a good job in the role of Jesse and the supporting cast is more than adequate. I particularly enjoy all of the scenes with William Devane. I think the key to these movies being good is that the original stories were good and just like the original books, I end up finishing the series wishing there were more."
5,Jesse Stone series great entertainment,"The Jesse Stone series of TV specials is great entertainment. Tom Selleck has long been one of our favorite actors, and he delivers once again in ""Death In Paradise."""
3,Something Done Well,"John Updike famously said, ""Ted Williams is the classic ballplayer of the game on a hot August weekday, before a small crowd, when the only thing at stake is the tissue-thin difference between a thing done well and a thing done ill."" That's how I feel about Jesse Stone, another Californian transplanted to New England. Ted Williams didn't pay much attention to fielding, but what he did pay attention to, he did very well. The ""Jesse Stone"" movies don't do everything well, but when it comes to producing character-driven, moody, exquisitely paced, hard-boiled entertainment, they do very well. The supporting cast is top notch. My favorite scene in ""Death in Paradise"" is when Jesse reads a book about Harry Simpson to ""Suit"". Satisfying storytelling."
4,All About Selleck,"Great character, great story, great scenery. I love Paradise. I am a Tom Selleck Fan and Jesse Stone suits him. The movies aren't flashy just consistantly good."
5,Jesse Stone: Death In Paradise,"I did not have a single problem in receiving the merchandise ordered .. Amazon is the only logical place to order anything from asthey are ""secure"". If a problem arises with anything ordered through them, it will be dealt with in a timely manner. It'swonderful when companies use Amazon to sell their wares because they have to live up to Amazon's standards.I did not have any concerns .. the product arrived in grade A condition AND it arrived a little earlier than expected."
4,The Ultimate Movie Review! -[...] - @tss5078,"Based on Jesse Stone Novel #3, Death In Paradise, was probably the best Jesse Stone book to make into a movie. On a cold rainy day, the body of a young, abused, teenage girl is found floating in the lake and Jesse gets obsessed with finding out why. As with most Robert B. Parker novels, the story is very solid, and this one was especially good, because it brings Jessie Stone right to the edge, and I feel like you really get to know him more intimately from this story. Tom Selleck, AKA Magnum P.I., once again is in a familiar role and makes the story that much stronger. I can't say much more without giving stuff away, but the ending is quite unexpected."
4,Sellick in good basic mystery,Here is a series made for Tom Sellick with really belivable plots with him providing good polished performances and mystery to the last portions of the movie.
5,Jesse Stone: Death in paradise,Tom Selleck always delivers and this is no exception. Great movie. Great seller. Fast and efficient.
2,Skip this one,"Don't waste your money on this one. The experts are correct, buy two cheap blades every six months"
1,Terrible Transfer to DVD,"I picked up a copy of this DVD for $1 at one of the neighborhood discount stores. The film quality is quite bad, especially for ""Alexander..."", which looks as though it was taken from a third or fourth generation VHS tape. The DVD is grossly overpriced here. The only reason for purchasing this DVD should be if you are eager to see ""Alexander..."" regardless of the picture quality. And even then I would check your local dollar stores for a copy first.My rating is solely for the quality of the DVD and has nothing to do with the merit of either of the two films."
2,Good movies but...,"These movies are both good, although dated. The low star rating is because of the poor quality of the video on the DVD."
2,cheap transfer,"I agree, horrible transfer. i got this for $1. But had to have alexander. My God, when i was a teen this film hit me so hard. Being a gay teen in the 70's was hard and this showed it. I cant believe they want so much for it now. look for it at places like thrift stores."
5,"MY FAVORITE FLIX""S","I REALLY LIKE MOVIES WITH LEE VAN CLEEF, ESPECIALLY WESTERNS. AM STILL WAITING FOR MY SECOND ORDER OF THIS TO ARRIVE, IT IS TO BE A GIFT TO SOMEONE, SO PLEASE GET IT TO SOON ."
3,Lee Van Cleef is one the best western bad guy/good guy ever,I allways liked Lee because of his face.You can tell by just looking athis face and know that you in a lot trouble.I enjoyed him with Clint Eastwood in those spaghetti westerns.
4,Collection,"Vintage Lee Van Cleef acted out his parts well. I always like these type of Westerns, they never date, but then I grew up on them. The stories always have the same theme but, coupled to the acting and stunning western scenery, they always capture me.Having been fortunate enough to visit the scenery in Spain at ""Cinema Studios Fort Bravo"", (""Texas Hollywood"") in the Desert of Tabernas, Almeria Spain (the only desert in Europe), and Andalucía, Spain doubling for the US in Arizona, New Mexico and California, the films give me added pleasure. Hope they go on remaking them so as to benefit from the new technology.I enjoyed these films which I saw on television, but I did see them originally at the cinema long before DVD's or Videos were in existence."
3,Quite Comprehensive for California,"I didn't read the book. However, I can tell you that Yuma is in Arizona, not California. Describing a ""California"" book as including ""Yuma to the Southeast"" is an inconsistency that is unfortunate when it is supposed to give you directions.""Look kids, 'Big Ben.'""I'm sure this is a very fine book. I just find inconsistencies a bit disconcerting. I still plan to buy this book. Just thought you should know."
1,Fake,"I took it with a lot casting,so, I paid for a Luthier to repair it, but the sax still a fake! Today I thrower it in the trash. Does not buy this brand, never, ever."
4,Original thinking,"It is nice to see a book that does not simply trot out the same old arguments all pillaged from other books and other authors. If nothing else, readers will find that Ellis' work is highly original and deeply thought provoking. Yes, it is true that his arguments are not entirely proven, but it is also true that he has systematically taken apart the traditional interpretations placed upon the biblical texts.The central thesis, that the Israelite leaders were actually the Hyksos pharaohs of Egypt, has a distinct ring of truth to it. I, for one, think Ellis is probably right here, but of course this small change changes every aspect of the biblical story."
5,"Logical, concise and interesting.",Very good. More truth than most would like to or be able to admit.
2,"Interesting ideas, but...","Interesting ideas about the connections between Egyptian religious beliefs, pharaohs and the Israelites. However, key supporting elements are not documented as having been researched and bring the entire work into question. But, read for yourself and see what you think. This book is certainly ""food for thought""."
5,"A great, great show","Well, here I am again, speaking about Yes. It can seem protection or even if I just like (and a lot - that is true) of Yes, but we will analyze that cd. Yes is one of the few bands that maintain the rhythm and the energy of the cd in a show. I had the opportunity to see the show and now to hear the CD. Some of the music are already in another live cds of the band , like Yours is no Disgrace, Time and Word, Ritual and other, however the new ones are also there, like Lightining Strikes, Homeworld (fantastic), It'll be a Good Day (wonderful) and another like Awaken. A great cd, should be part of the collection of any fan of Yes, or same who would like of having some CD of the band. It is a fantastic show, where everybody is well, Anderson's voice is fantastic. The keyboards are excellent, Cris Squire is great, like as always. What more I have to say? Just... long live to Yes."
4,no Kaye or Wakeman,"This is not a bad live disc. The sound is decent and it's all one show instead of different shows. Sure, you can find millions of live versions of I've Seen All Good People and Roundabout on other live Yes cds, but somehow, even though there's no Tony Kaye or Rick Wakeman, this cd is worth the money. I feel ripped off, though, because the song 'Hearts' was performed at this concert and they did not include it on the cd or dvd. WHY? That's one of Yes' best songs ever! From what I hear, Billy Sherwood sang Trevor's parts, and Steve Howe did the closing Guitar solo with the slide guitar. THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN INCLUDED ON THE CD AND DVD!!! Anyway, this is a good show that all Yes fans should have. If you're not too familiar with Yes, then you should also try this cd out. It does have their big hits that the non-Yes fans have heard on the radio or whatever. Plus it has a few songs that non-Yes fans have never heard that they SHOULD hear, like Perpetual Change and Awaken."
2,Pass,"Very poor sound mix, songs seem to be played in slow motion very little energy. Stick with Yessongs the seminal live CD."
4,Good live album,"This is a superb live recording that has been recorded, mixed, and mastered by someone who really knew what he was doing. This is one of the best sounding Yes live albums ever. I wish this production had been done on the KTA albums! The material is uneven, with the new album's songs being much stronger and still some work by the oversized band (four Yesmen plus the now-departed Billy Sherwoord and Igor who was in a moraz of keyboard parts he was still feeling out) to arrange the older stuff. Don't be fooled; Ritual is just Jon humming a few bars before the next song begins. Ditto for Time and a Word. They did not perform the whole songs!"
1,Beware when ordering this,In stock does not mean in stock. Ordered this and brake for other side. Get email that this caliper is back ordered and after 3 weeks my order is cancelled and waiting for refund. Recieved the other caliper in the mail and missing parts. Description has changed since I ordered. Originally stated this caliper was with bracket. No bracket recieved with caliper or any mounting hardware at that.
3,Performance Tuning for Linux Servers,"Each chapter is written by a different person, and as result there's a rather disparate feel to the whole book. It's more like collection of scientific paper, authored by stuffy prefessors cooped up in a dusty office somewhere. The words are interesting and well written, and there's plenty to learn, but if you're expecting a group of quick hacks to impress your boss on Monday morning, you'll be disappointed. You will however, be a better and wiser systems administrator.for more book reviews, read <a href=""http://www.street71.com/techbook/2005/12/26/performance-tuning-for-linux-servers/"">Tech Books Reviews</A> on Performance Tuning for Linux Servers."
2,not so good,"I found this book to be uneven, and to have problems getting the details right, even in some simple cases. I really wanted to like this book, and I hope IBM can put together a second edition that fixes the serious flaws this one has."
3,Dark screen,The mirror screen is quite small and unless you have the perfect lighting it is not very clear. The picture washes out in bright sun and if it is night time forget it. I am planning to get a different camera and see if it helps. Not overly impressed at this point.
3,Rear View camera system,"Mirror jiggles when driving even though it feels solid. Camera image is good, quality is good. Auto iris does not close up enough and in bright sun the image is a bit washed out. And the image on the mirror is washed out further. It works best when the weather conditions are the worst or in a public garage."
2,Dell 1700 series Toner Cartridge Replacement,"The price is good. The delivery was fast. However, the quality is not up to par. It leaves toner on the edge of the paper (leakage). I would not purchase this product again."
1,These cartridges don't work,"We initially bought 1 of these cartridges for the Dell 1700n printer in our store. It worked fine. Based on that experience we bought four more. Every one of them is defective. We even tried them in a second printer to make sure that it wasn't a printer problem. I'm not sure what the cause is, but once we bought an OEM Dell cartridge the printer works again just fine. We had them on our supply shelf and didn't find out they were defective until after the Amazon return period had expired. So, we're out $100. Save yourself the grief and don't buy these."
5,Great Game,"I bought this for my grandson he loves it. Plays for hours even though he gets mad at some of the players who won't pass the ball. He still needs to find out how to earn money to buy things during the game. I would recamend this game for all those who like basketball,"
4,good overview,"Warwick Bray is the undisputed expert on the subject. He adds great archaeological depth to an otherwise incomprehensible collection of golden artifacts. Yes, they are very pretty, but without the authors insight and explanations, they are worth nothing, apart from aesthetically. Great plates and photographs. Good for anybody interested in Precolumbian artwork."
3,wrong item,"Before shipment, I changed the item to a Landmark 2 watches automatic watch winder. Amazon was supposed to adjust payment. This has not been done.I received the 2 watchwinder as requested. Please adjust payment."
4,Quick and entertaining read,"I might take issue with how the word terror is used in this story, but I won't. Overall this is readable and not nearly complicated enough to make your head hurt from thinking too much. I finished it in just two sittings, so it was good enough for me."
3,"They don't fit like the older versions, way too big.","I bought a small and they were way to big. I am 5'7"" and they would go 3-4 inches below my knees. Great quality though, I wish they fit better."
4,A comfortable fit,These shorts are made of a silky material that keeps the body cool in hot weather. We live in Australia where the summers are extremely hot and my boyfriend wears these every chance he gets. They also make great lounge-wear for men.
1,What's the point?,There are no pockets on these stupid shorts! I need pockets...everyone does. What a waste. How hard would it be to sew in some pockets under armour?
2,NO Pockets and way too long,"I love the material of this short, its much bigger than normal S size to me but I can live with that, without any pockets drives me nuts. I have to carry my cell phone and keys all the time. When I go to the store, I got to carry my back pack for my keys and phones. I'm 5.11, not a short guy, but the short is as long as a skirt, I had no choice to buy a Small size still looking like wearing a skirt. I'm not those basketball player slim giant."
4,Comfortable Workout Shorts,These workout shorts are not only very comfortable but let you breathe as well. I love them. They are lightweight but very durable too.
2,Wouldn't buy again.,Smell is not strong enough to fragrant my car. Can basically only smell it with nose practically touching the container. Even what little smell there is fades after a very short time. Only plus is the cool looking container. No point in a good looking air freshener that doesn't have a smell though.
1,Not worth the money,I bought this item for my grandson and granddaugter and within one minute of opening it on Christmas it ripped trying to put on the PSP unit. Totally Use Less! There are no instructions or anything on how they should be applied to the unit. It was a total waste of my money. I would not recommend although the concept to protect the unit is great.
4,Daughter LOVES Blue!,"My daughter LOVES Blue and I was hoping this video would help her with her nightmares she keeps having. Love the idea of ""changing your dreams"" so they are not scary. Only wish this was available on DVD! Quick shipping by seller. THANKS!!"
4,An important book...,"...but he blamed the parents, while reaearch has shown that many mental illnesses have a bio-chemicl bases."
1,Not New item,I thought the item I was buying was a new item. The books came with writing in them to another child. As I had bought these as a gift this was a large disappointment.
4,Love Good night Moon,My 15 month old loves Good Night moon and brings it to me to read over and over(He really loves the illustrations and repeatedly points at the red balloon). He doesn't like the runaway bunny -- he won't sit still to listen to the story. I recommend Good Night Moon highly but not the runnaway bunny.
1,"distorted, untrue, a waste of money and time","I read Mr. Harris' book while on the way back from China, after studying in Beijing as an exchange student. Reflecting upon my experiences in China, I was amazed at how Mr. Harris distorts the truth. Almost everything he says in the book is incomplete or distorted. If anyone wants to know more about China and its people, the best way is to go and visit, and see for himself. The worst he can do is read Mr. Harris diminutive lies. I regret my parents wasted their money to buy this book for me."
1,"To See Behind the Chinese Face, We Need to Be Chinese","The fundamental flaw in this book is that it is written by an American. For any Westerner to presume that they can, with authority, describe what makes Chinese tick is ludicrous. The book is all the more damaging because it is written in a style that leads some readers to believe it is based on scientific study by a well-healed professional.I know the author of this book. I have seen him as a client, and was dismayed by his lack of understanding of Chinese people. He is an American who has lived in Hong Kong for over twenty-five years, but has retained his American viewpoint. When his book came out, my Chinese husband and I both read it. There are so many Western-style generalizations about Chinese people in this book that it is an insult to all Chinese. I was very surprised to see it still on the shelves of the foreign language section of Xinhua Book Store the last time I was in Beijing."
1,"Nice idea, but too slippery","These rugs are lovely and feel like velvet, but we slipped so much that we tried putting another rug under it, which was 6 total rugs in 3 bathrooms. A little too much work for a rug."
1,Ligtning Double Strap Sneaker Review,We could not use these shoes. The tongues on these shoes are too short and we had to force them on. They were even a 1/2 size larger than our grandson wore. It was a big disappointment and waste of money. Save your receit.
5,Great Sneakers,"I bought them for my 3 year old Grandson and he loves them. I was surprised at how well they are made for the price. He has a wide foot, but these sneakers fit fine. He loves the way they light up."
4,very nice,Over all I'm very pleased with the product. Read these books when I was younger and just had to have them for my younger cousins. Excellent for storytime! The only reason that I gave it 4 out of 5 stars is because it is a box set and it was wrapped so tightly that the box itself was dented on all corners. Other than that it's a fantastic set of books that anyone would enjoy.
5,Good Clean Fantasy Fun!,"I have loved The Enchanted Forest Chronicles since I was in eighth grade. Cimorine is headstrong and humorous. At times I have to stop reading to laugh. She reminds me of a medieval Harry Potter. Anyone who enjoys the Harry Potter books will love these books. I prefer this book because it is all put together in one hard cover edition, but the individual books are great too."
3,Old favorites stand the test of time,"I loved these books when I was a kid. The first two are fantastic, just like I remembered, but I stopped reading a few pages into the third one--just like I did the first time I read these. I wish the author had stopped after #2!"
4,great series,"this is about a princess who's captured by a dragon, and then chooses to stay with the dragon rather than wait to get rescued by a prince. in fact when a prince comes to rescue her in the first book she turns him away, all of them. the series follows the pattern of a typical 'princess story' and the princess is put in a bunch of stereotypical princess situations, but then she defies the stereotype and takes charge of her own life and makes things happen for herself. basically she beats up her own bad guys, with her brain. there are boys in the series, but she isn't waiting for them to save the day, she takes them along for the ride. the dragon who kidnapped her ends up being one of her good friends.it's a fun series i really enjoyed in elementary school, but it an appropriate read for anyone interested in the plot (as are all stories... age ranges close your mind). a light fun read, i recommend."
5,Perfect for the Punk Princess,"The Enchanted Forest series is a childhood favorite of mine. It's the perfect story for that little girl who knows that its the knights who need to be rescued, and that damsels in distress are some of the best actresses. You meet Cimorene, a strong willed princess who would rather learn how to fence than when to scream during a giant's abduction. When she runs away to keep from being married off, she meets a dragon who accepts her as her princess. This leads her off into a world of adventure where she couldn't be happier in her ""improper princess"" life."
5,Highly reccomended for the young and the young-at-heart,"These books are amazing. I read them in elementary school and now at the age of 20 I can still remember being absolutely inspired by the characters. Humor, romance, adventure, and unlikely heros combine to make these ideal books for any reader. Finding them here has inspired me to go back and read them again."
5,A delightful twist on your average fairy tales.,"The Enchanted Forest Chronicles are an absolutly wonderful set of stories. They take the simple premise of your standard fairy tales (Everything from toad princes, knights in armor, and the standard evil witch.) and turn the stereotypes on their heads. Perfect for children, these books are also a wonderful delight to anybody who enjoys a good read. The writing is witty and smart and the tales move at a wonderful pace that will have you devour them wanting more. The price that is listed above is an excellent deal for all four books, if you enjoy a good book you could hardly do better than the ones here."
5,Magical Joy,This series is one of my oldest favorites. I first read them in elementary school and now in college I still love them. They are classics that you will go back to again and again. Short and sweet I turn to them if I need that fantastical escape.
4,Practical Princess,"This is a fun series for young girls, starring a self-sufficient princess and a coven of dragons of a variety of temperaments. Superficial, fluffy reading, but still fun and relaxing to read. The last book in the series kind of annoyed me because I hate it when there are characters who are in the dark about their history and they just bumble around trying to figure out what's going on. Still, there was a happy ending, of course, and it all turned out in the end."
5,Whimsical and Humourous,"these stories are wonderful. i laughed through half of the books, and then i had some of my elementary age cousins read the series as well. they were able to comprehend them easily, as well as finding them enchanting."
4,Interesting comparisons on military strategy,"Short, interesting, and informative. Enjoyed the comparisons with each other. This will be great for future military leaders to study"
2,Not much good without maps,"If all you want is the text, then this version is fine. But, you really should have the maps to get the most from this work. Better to spend a dollar or two for a version with the illustrations."
2,"OK, but disappointed","I was hoping this book would be a great resource for our upcoming family trip to Hawaii. However, I found it to be lacking many of the fun kid-friendly activities I have found on the internet. I was most frustrated by the lack of ANY waterfall information for Oahu. Especially since the book lists a visit to Manoa Falls as one of the top ten things to do on Oahu (then fails to tell you anything about Manoa Falls)! I haven't read any of the other Hawaii travel books for families that Amazon carries, but I certainly wouldn't recommend this one."
5,a sweet and funny book,"The authors descriptions of relationship conundrums are not only astute but detailed with just the right amount of understatement: ""Yeah. Women Cheat. But generally when a woman cheats, its because she realizes that no matter what she does or how hard she tries, she will never get what she needs from the relationship she is in, so she ends it through catastrophic intervention.""Some of the subject matter is a bit self-depreciating. Some of it just made me laugh until I cried. But overall, some good takes on the give and take of relationships and most importantly, some genuinely good advice!"
1,Pretty narrow view of relationships,"My sense reading this was that the author believed that all men tend to devalue women and treat them badly. I know that not to be the case. The early pages were humorous & fun, but the last half of the book seemed pretty apologetic to me."
5,A GREAT BOOK!,"This normally isnt my genre, but a close friend turned me onto this book and I couldn't put it down. Great dialogue, great combat, realistic relationship between characters. Real enough to frustrate you! Just like real life, ummm, if you lived in 13th century Wales and were caught up in the interclan struggles as good men, bad men, good women and bad women vied to win the day."
4,For my Literature and Medicine class,"Read for Ward No. 6 and Enemies. Some stories easier to get through then others; if you're a Russian lit aficionado, dig in."
1,This book isn't clever or humorous... it's pathetic!!!,"Here is a synopsis: She's bitter, bitter, bitter about her divorce. She considers ""working"" as hosting a dinner party. She thinks that average sized women should be proud, but she's a Size 6... she's a Size 6... she's a Size 6... oh, did she forget to tell someone that she's a Size 6? And her idea of a good time is to have sex with someone whose only qualification is to be slightly above half her age. This woman is ICKY!"
3,Know what you're buying!!,"This book may be wonderful for the person that buys it intentionally. But if you're a beginner like me, you probably don't need a ""price guide"" but rather need the encyclopedia that Edwards has to match this book. At the time I ordered it, I didn't see the encyclopedia and didn't know the difference. If you want a book to identify pieces and patterns, get the encyclopedia. The price guide is just that, a price guide."
1,This is supposed to be what?,"The book title is a bit deceiving. The cover does say, ""Standard Encyclopedia of Carnival Glass"". What part of 'encyclopedia' did I miss? This is nothing more than cheap paper with a long list of designs. If you ever hope to identify anything, this is not the book for you. Personally, I thought an 'encyclopedia' might help me identify, but not a single picture. My book now resides at the paper recycling dump. It really is that worthless."
5,Great Book,"I was not so much interested in the value of the carnival glass since this is an older book..I was more interested in be able to recognize the various companies, designs and know which one are the more rare ones."
3,Not what I was looking for,The cover on the books says it all. It is a price guide but I was looking for a picture book.
1,Confusing!!,"This book is useless if you do not know a lot about carnival glass. I was very disappointed, it was a waste of money for a beginning collector!"
4,"An interesting, yet not perfect, story.","WASHINGTON! is the book that sets the tone for the rest of the Wagons West! series, as it is the book that establishes Toby Holt as the central character. He was wounded during the War, and now must face returning back home to a wife that he hardly knows. He also must deal with a corrupt lumberman that rules the town of Tumwater like a fiefdom.However, too much deux ex machina hurts the book. Acts of nature are responsible for all the death surrounding Toby, nit him himself. Also, there were some unnecessary plot twists that were not necessary, like Toby's dog joining a wolf pack for a while and dealing with Nez Pierce."
2,Stating the obvious,"This book focuses only on identifying the visual, auditory and kinaethetic (VAK) representational systems and applying them to communication, learning and training. The author admits in the Preface, ""Many trainers may read this book and believe that, in my discussions of the various training aids, I am stating the obvious. To a certain extent, that is true."" (p.xii) I'm afraid this is too true. Sally's effort to give more detailed discussions only insults the intelligence of trainers. Do not be misled by the title of the book, thinking that you'll get much help ""through NLP"". The scope is very limited and the content much too basic."
3,Just OK,"I really like the other, spicier beef jerky by B Bill's (Habanero). This one purports to be ""Cajun"", but I couldn't detect a single spice in the bag"
1,One color plastic waste of money,This is such a silly idea. There is nothing holographic about this chunk of plastic with no paint and no details and no excitement. I literally laughed when we opened it.
3,For the collector.,"An unexciting piece. Of value only to the completist collector (like myself). There's nothing wrong with it, it's just that there's nothing ""great"" about it either. The lauching projectiles are unnecessary for a ""holographic"" figure. Hasbro could has done better by choosing another ""host"" sculpt to base this exclusive off of. The ""Phantom Menace"" version was much better!"
2,Very disappointed,This little figure is really a piece of junk. Poor detail and poor packaging. Next springs garage sale item for sure.
4,FUN AND ORIGINAL ...,"This is a fun toy to have around, especially for boys and men who think they're boys!Better get yours from Amazon. I have a hunch Toys R Us will sell out quickly.Here's to the little kid in all of us."
4,"Very practical, very useful","An excellent book with very practical examples, especially for JSPs. Explains the concepts of Tag libraries very well. Not as good strictly for Servlets but overall an excellent resource for JSP's. Hope the authors comeup with new books to cover Java Beans, EJB's Struts etc."
5,Excellent book for the subject,"I used this book as the text for a course in applied client/server computing. This book passed the test: I would definitely use it again.The 'alternating page' format that the authors use is unique. It makes the information in the book very easy to absorb: description on the left page, code example on the right page. It's so simple and so effective it makes me wish I'd thought of it first. ;) And even with so many code examples, I don't recall finding a single error.This is a wonderful, no-fluff, down-to-business, practical introduction to the subject. The authors carefully guide the reader through installation of all the tools needed to start writing servlets and JSPs. This book requires that the reader already have a decent understanding of Java.Great job, Andrea and Joel."
2,Not an advanced book. Disappointed.,"If you are a novice, this is a good book.Without enough due diligence I bought this book based on it's recent publish date, and it's 5 star review. Big mistake. First red flag after receiving the book, no mention of what version of JSP is being documented!? If you are looking for an in depth technical discussion/reference of JSP 2.0, do not go here. This book is basic."
1,Run!,"I am so disappointed with this set. I know that it is a good ""bargain,"" but I had no idea that it would be this cheap. The sheets are like wrinkled sandpaper, even after numerous washes with fabric softner AND the comforter set pieces never release their wrinkles, even after pressing. Finally, the comforter came complete with an ugly snag. I would not recommend this ""buy"" for someone I dislike, muchless someone I don't know. Don't be fooled by the pretty picture."
3,Setup is not so easy.,"I opened my nami chair a few days ago, and the constrution seems solid. I am having problems getting all of the nylon ropes correctly adjusted. The chair leans slightly to one side. Also, correct for height before you sit in it, as the weight tightens the knots."
1,Poor quality control,3 weeks ago I purchased a product of a different brand for installing radio. I t did not work.This time I order a different brand for the same purpose and it came without any instructions.You need to provide better and more comprehensive information about your products.These failure are time consuming expensive. I have over $25 in 2 products th have zero value.
4,Interesting switch of perspectives,"This post-war book is thick with British idioms and terms, and so it was read slowly and deliberately! This is a very well-researched book. It describes a returning soldier's coming to terms with the horrors of war which he had experienced in Burma during WWII. The story opens with his return; very little of it is flashbacks, except when necessary, and only to tie it in to a current happening in the plot. The soldier's wife and young son have learned to be self-reliant while he was away, and their adjustments to his return are slow and painstaking. Well written, yet the ending was too hastily composed, in my opinion. A long, drawn out plot which ends abruptly, toying with one's emotions, is a characteristic of books which some like....I prefer a calmer resolution."
3,No Dramas Here,"When Sam Richardson returned home from Burma after the second World War, nothinkg appreared to have changed in his hometown. However, traumatised from his experience, he found it difficult to adjust. He loved his wife Ellen and son Joe deeply, but having returned almost as a stranger to them, he had hurdles to cross to forge bonds with them. While he desperately wanted to get out of the familiar and routine surroundings, Ellen and Joe wanted to stay put almost as desperately.Unsentimental and almost glommy, this book is not for readers looking for dramatic plots or romance. It simply moves the reader along with the thoughts and feelings of the two central characters, Sam and Ellen"
3,"Read one, already read them all","This book is nice, the action parts are good, but AGAIN? Once more Carlyle is betrayed, once more the Legion suffers, once more they lose their dropships, once more they face unsurmountable odds, just like in "" Decision at Thunder Rift"" and ""Mercenary's Star""."
4,Boice's best,"Boice was the model of scholarly pastor -- BA Harvard; MDiv. Princeton Seminary; PhD Basel Switzerland. He spent his entire ministry at one church (30 years at 10th Presbyterian), in the city he loved and grew it to thousands.I have used his commentaries now in Ephesians, Acts, Genesis, and John, and in my opinion his work in John is his best. For one it is his most thorough -- about 5 times as long as the similarly sized book of Acts. It was also the subject of his graduate work. Lastly, his NT work tends to be less moralistic and more Christ-Centered than his OT work. This is esp. true of this John work."
2,Not impressed,"I bought this CD for ""Go Tell it on the Mountain"" by Brenda Lee to sing with our church choir. I realize that it is not the original artists, but the artists they use are pretty bad. And there is too much background vocals even on the karaoke version. What is the point of it being karaoke if you can't sing it by yourself? So, I feel like I wasted my money. We could have just jazzed ours up with the piano. May not have been as easy as a CD, but results would be better."
5,One of the best books on the history of Islam,I read this book 2 years ago and was fascinated by the detail on the life of Mohammad and the history of Arabs and their conquests post-Islam. I recommend this to anyone interested in history and learning about the events that led to Islam becoming one of the major religions of the world today. Unfortunately this book was out of print for a while and I am glad to see it is back.
4,Beautiful and Informative,"Sandman: the King of Dreams is a wonderful coffetable-eque art book. However, it also contains many insights into the world of the Sandman and the creative process. Alisa Kwitney was a one time editor of the comic series and brings wonderful anecdotes about the writers, artists and characters that I have not heard anywhere else. This bok is clearly written with love for the world of The Sandman.The art is also gorgeuos. images from the comics are replicated here in a wonderful format. also there are many images taken from other comics and trading cards and several that have been hiding in the editorial vault.though this book is not as detailed as Hy Bender's wonderful ode to the series, and the two do cover the same ground on occasion, this is an excellent addition to anyones'sSandman library."
4,Decent...,"I'm a big fan of Outlaw Golf (but that is for the Xbox). This game stands up there, but gets pretty technical and isn't a ""pick up and play"" game for a quick 9 with a group of friends...you have to concentrate quite a bit."
5,Fun golf game,"This game is highly addicting, it can be as easy or hard as you want it to be depending on the golf club you use. Now I'm not the biggest golf fan, but I love this game! easy to play for long periods of time. Please go to [...] for reviews for this game and other games too!"
5,u want another reason to buy this one right away?,well ratchet and clank and jax and daxter are two other playable characters in the game. this game blows away all golf games including the stiff and boring tiger woods game. the graphics are really serene and stunning. the gameplay is easy and addictive as hell.nuff said. xbox sucks
3,Most overated title..don't be fooled,"This game is slow, this game is boring. However, it does have very nice scenary. You only get 2 characters to start with so there is a lot of unlocking to do. But the game just isn't interesting enough to make you want to play it again. SORRY Hot Shots, you're getting traded in for another title."
4,A lost classic!,"When I was a newly converted metal head back in '89, I first heard them (playing Sin Killer) on the California Metal 2 compilation. sometime later, I got the cassette of the album as soon as it hit my local Christian bookstore. In retrospect they sounded just like any southern California hair band at that time, but the skills were there and the songs are strong. They were good, but didn't last beyond the later period of the hairband era."
3,Average book.,"Lots of the material in this book is obvious to anyone over the age of 10. I had to use it in a course on negotiation but got very little from the book. Don't know anything about other books in the field but this is full of cliches. An example:'If negotiators can induce their opponents to make the initial offers, they can bracket their objectives by adjusting their own opening offers to place their goals near the midpoint between their respective opening positions. For example, if plaintiff attorneys hope to get $300,000, they can begion with a demand in the $500,000 range to keep their $300,000 target in the middle.'One would hope that anyone who has gotten as far as law school would not need to be told such obvious things."
5,AWESOME SOUNDTRACK BUT..,A WALK TO REMEMBER THE SOUNDTRACK EXTENDED EDTION IS SO AWESOME. I LOVE ALL OF THE SONGS ESPECIALLY MANDY MOORE'S CRY AND BOTH VERSIONS OF SWITCHFOOT'S ONLY HOPE. THERE IS ALSO MANDY MOORE'S MUSIC VIDEO CRY ON THE DISC AS A SPECIAL FEATURE. BUT I HAVE ONE PROBLEM WHY DO THEY NOT HAVE MISSY ELLIOT'S SONG GET UR FREAK ON ON THIS SOUNDTRACK. BECAUSE THEY PLAY THIS SONG IN THE MOVIE. I WAS AND I AM NOT HAPPY ABOUT THIS. OTHERWISE THEN THAT A AM VERY HAPPY:) GREAT FOR A WALK TO REMEMBER FANS AND MANDY MOORE FANS AND PEOPLE ALIKE. LIKE I SAID IN MY OPINION AWESOME!
4,"Great CD, if you're a fan of the movie","If you didn't see the movie, you probably won't like the soundtrack. The songs don't stick to a theme. It's not exactly easy listening, but Mandy Moore makes it what it is."
5,Why to get this soundtrack!,"First of all, let me start by saying how amazing this soundtrack is! It features:Many BEAUTIFUL picturesA new version of Mandy's ""Only Hope"" songMandys duet with Jonathen Forman""Its Gonna Be Love"" by Mandy Moore""Cry"" by Mandy Moore""I Believe"" by Rachel Lampa.& much more!""Only Hope"" by Switchfoot""Mother, We Just Can't Get Enought"" New Radicals""Track 4"" -sorry[i forget the title!]I love all the Mandy Moore songs on her & the others I mentioned. They are amazing & have their own original thing going on! Its hard to describe, but once you give it a try, you'll see why its 5 stars!"
1,this soundtrack is awfull,"seriouslly bri has never heard the album or seen this terrible excuse for a film. mandy more was terrible as usual and the music is the only thing in this world that is worse. go check out some really good music like ruben studdard's ""sorry 2004"" or montell jordon's ""this is how we do it"" thats some real music. Also jude law is terrible and his movies are awfull. i dont know whether its the movies that are bad or jude law that makes it bad."
5,permanent residence in my cd player,"This soundtrack definelty ranks up with the top CDs I own or listen too. The music selection from the movie takes the listener back to the scenes from the movie and you can relive Jamie Sullivan and Lance Carter's walk in your mind over and over while you listen to Mandy Moore belt out one phenomenal hit after another. Switchfoot is also featured on the soundtrack and is exquiste in both calibar and emotion.The soundtrack is a great buy; especially if you liked the hit flick teenage drama ""A Walk to Remember"" or if you are a fan of Mandy Moore. The soundtrack is appealing to all ages and music tastes and is worth giving a chance."
5,Great Soundtrack,The other review says it all...this is a great soundtrack if you liked the movie. It comes with a couple of extra tracks that aren't on the other version.
1,Never comes to grips with the views it aims to rebut,"Touted as a rebuttal to the Pauline scholarship of e.g. Hyam Maccoby (author of _The Mythmaker_ and _Paul and Hellenism_), this alleged rebuttal never gets around to doing the rebutting. Maccoby is mentioned early on, in a footnote, and then his views are NEVER mentioned again.In particular Wenham never deals with Paul's own claim (in 1 Corinthians 15) to have received his ""gospel"" by direct revelation rather than from the apostles in Jerusalem. This single verse alone would topple Wenham's case -- yet he NEVER ONCE addresses Maccoby's cogent arguments in favor of this reading.In short, this book leaves Pauline scholarship very much where it was: with Paul as the true founder of Christianity. Wenham's work will be convincing only to those who already believe."
2,He needs more citations,"I am still not convinced that Paul is not the great villian and founder of the new religion called Christianity. Just read the book called ""Mythmaker: Paul and the Inventions of Christianity"". I thought this book would be more convincing. I wasted almost $10 on this book. That money could have gone towards better use such a charity donation. I am going to be more careful before I purchase religious books (especially ones that claim the Christian way to be the only way backed up by evidence). I am stupid for making this mistake twice.All I can say was the author needs more citations to back up his findings that Jesus (not Paul) was the actual founder of Christianity. I wasn't amused by all his citations in the back."
1,Cheap quality--don't bother buying this,I returned this right after opening it. Not very solidly built.
4,Beats Microwave Popcorn,"Not especially glamorous, but functional. Nice ""roasted"" popcorn taste that microwaved popcorn can not duplicate. Takes a little practice to get the timing down and of course you need to ""babysit"" the popper while using it. Easy to clean. No complaints."
5,I LOVE THE SPICE GIRLS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,HELLO PEOPLE I HAVE EVERYTHING OF THE SPICE GIRLS THE KEY CHAIN UP TO THE SHIRT SPICE GIRLS KEEP ON ROCKING DONT LET PEOPLE DRAG YOU DOWN KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK!!!GIRL POWER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1 YEAH !!!!!!!!!!!!
2,stupid movie trying so hard to be cool,"watched like reading a comic book. so many murders for so little money. corpses never turned stink in the thailand humid and hot temperature. lousy acting, directing and totally stupid screenplay with twisted to the limit ridiculousness and impossibility. a story so bad that turned into a disturbing watch. boasted with awards and high praises for the primitiveness or roughness of the poor plot and scenario? give me a break!"
3,Dark Comedy From Thailand,"Pen-Ek Ratanaruang's black comedy Ruang Talok 69 (A Funny Story About 6 and 9) is one of those films that owe much to their American counterparts. In fact in plotting and design 6ixtynin9 owes much to the filmmaking of Quentin Tarantino.6ixtynin9 involves the misadventures of recently laid off Thai fianance worker Tum (Lalita Panyopas) who finds a box containing 25,000.00 outside her apartment door on the very day she is fired. The movie essentially shows the lengths that she will go to keep the money as she is pursued by Thai boxers, gangsters and the police.Panyopas does a grat job in her role but the story is just a little too farfetched for my taste. The bodies pile up and the resolution is not as strong as it could have been but the film does usher in a new talent in Ratanaruang who does his best to make 6ixtynin9 a cool thriller.The disc offers a decent transfer but no special features."
5,Good Read,"This book is a great read for anyone who teaches. Multicultural issues affect all teachers in the classroom and influence the learning of children. Even if the climate is homogenous, teachers need to be aware of how to deal with anomolies when students are not learning as they should. This book offers suggestions and details practices that are helpful. The programs can be applied to areas other than reading and writing."
2,Paramount Just Killed Future Purchases For Many,It is obvious Paramount wants to put a nail in the coffin for this series on DVD. We will be paying more for less and it will take 20 years to get every episode. If PARAMOUNT cared they would have released this Season by season about every three months which helps sales. They falter when more and more time passes and now with half season sets this will make it worse for older generations to want to purchase the DVDs. Thanks Paramount for no longer wanting to stand behind the show. You know it I know it and anyone who tries to purchase TV shows knows it.
1,Why?,"Dynasty: Season Three V. 1 (3pc) (Full Dub Sub)Why has Dynasty Season 3 been seperated into Volumes? I have no intention of buying 2 seperate volumes - I will just wait for there to be a complete Season 3 box set.The packaging for Season 2 was excellent - slimline case (the same size as a standard case) containing 6 discs.I could not fault it at all.We had to wait so long for Season 2 and now with Season 3 devoted fans of the series are being messed around given Volumes?Get you act together and give us complete season box sets.I can't see any reason for only giving us three disc and half a series, apart from doubling the cost to the customer."
1,NOT A CHANCE IN HELL!!!!!!!,How dare they??????? How double diddleeiae dare they split a season over 2 volumes? I've been waiting with bated breath for this to be released and what do Paramount do? Split it!!!!! Not a chance in hell will I buy into this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,EXCUSE ME?,"I really can't believe what the owners of the series are doing with it. Do you think a first volume will actually sell? For those of us who saw the actual series on TV this verges disrespect. Come on, guys. Do the right thing. You should launch all seasons as soon as possible and in full!"
1,"Greed, Greed For Ripping Off Fans of Dynasty","As a child, I grew up loving the show but agree with the other reviewers. It is a slap in the face to wait months to release Season 3 and then have it released in parts. I for one will not be suckered into this game. I will buy the dvd use for $10. More than likely, this dvd set will sell poorly due to this greed. If I were in charge at Paramount, I would consider coming out with a revised dvd set which has the complete season 3. Dallas is up to season 9 has always released complete seasons. In fact the first volume had 1 and 2 together. I love you Blake, Krystal and Alexis but it appears Paramount wants to make a Dynasty off of cheating your fans. I say to the other fans let's join together and not buy Season 3 until Paramount can offer this in a complete season on dvd."
1,"DYNASTY: SEASON 3, VOLUME 1 IS A RIP-OFF!!!","If I was rating this series, it would get 5 STARS- JOHN FORSYTHE, JOAN COLLINS, PAMELA SUE MARTIN, GORDON THOMSON, AL CORLEY, JOHN JAMES, HEATHER LOCKLEAR AND LINDA EVANS RULE- but the fact that season 3 is being split up into 2 volumes is just another ridiculous, greedy way to get more money from consumers. WTF?!? If This DVD was jam packed with extra and DYNASTY: THE REUNION, it would almost be understandable. But I gurantee it is not. It's just a greedy, corporate gimmick, designed to screw the fans- and totally screw up how our collection looks!!!! DYNASTY could learn from how DALLAS is realeased. Bam. Bam. Season 9 is on the way- no stupid volumes, lots of interviews and extras- and no lengthy delays!!!"
1,This is a poor release,"How in the world could Paramount release a poor DVD production. I purchased the product and found it a mess. You have to press play on all the episodes, on the DVD it doesn't have play all on the DVDS for the episodes. This was a waste for Paramount to put this out like that considering the other the previous season that they released on DVD."
1,PARAMOUNT CAN GO TO HELL.....,I refuse to buy this as when you buy a drama series you expect to see the season ending in the one boxset and not have to fork out the same money for half as much. Paramount dont care (its all about the money of course) as they are now releasing Melrose Place Season 5 Volume 1. What a load of @#%$...Go to hell Paramount....Everyone boycott them and dont buy anything off them!!!!
2,The End of A Dynasty?,"I don't know why it's taken so long for Dynasty to come to DVD in the first place. I'm outraged that now the releases are reduced to volumes rather than seasons. The show was tops in the ratings and ABCs answer to Dallas for years. So what gives to these slow releases and now volumes. I'll be buying just to have the uncut episodes. I'm not thrilled with the format, hopefully Paramount will shape up."
1,Don't buy and show that you are MAD,"I'll add my two cents..I loved the showed Dynasty and purchased the first two Seasons. I will not buy split seasons, that is taking advantage of the fans of this show. I will wait until the powers that be realize they are wrong or I will simply do without. So sad!"
4,Split season??,It is absurd to split this season into two sets and charge $36 list price each set. There are only 24 episodes this season! Season 2 listed at $39 for all 22 episodes. They've dragged this out already far too long. Paramount also releases Melrose Place Season 4 in April and includes all 32 episodes/9 discs for under $60. ($42 on Amazon) which leaves us all scratching our heads over this.
1,Dynasty Season 3,I will not be puchasing this DVD until V.2 is released. Why take the risk of purchasing V.1 when the studio could turn around and cancel releasing V.2.
1,Greedy,"I'm a big fan of Dynasty, but i won't be buying any of the dvds, especially after they decided to split up the season. sorry."
3,"Buy it used if you want, but dont expect to see Seasons 4-9 on dvd.","Yes, splitting the seasons is annoying. But if its the only way to get the show released on DVD, then we have to deal with it. The low sales of season 1 caused years of delay before Season 2 was released. And with these specialty audience sets that arent as popular, retailers dont like to stock $60 items that will go unbought and collect dust on their shelves.Dynasty isnt the first show to have split seasons, wont be the last. All this buying it used talk will only serve to ensure seasons 4-9 dont get a release if the studios dont make a profit off these sets."
5,squeekswoowoos,Super fast delivery!! Would definetly buy from this company again!!The package was is superb condition!! Great job to the company!!Everything was brand new!!! Super super!!
1,RIPPED IN THREE!,This is being sold in 3 volumes! Screw it. I will no longer contribute to supply ermine toilet paper to paramount or that wax museum Candi Spelling or any of the other carpetbaggers in this rip-off. Thanks for nothin greedy jerk wads! Great show though.
3,Dynasty-3rd season-vol 1,I am from the U.K and I have bought the last 2 seasons and I have been very pleased with the price I have paid from Amazon(u.s) compared to the U.K price.However on reading the reviews on the latest Dynasty offering I agree most strongly that Paramount are attempting to rip off avid fans of this super series in releasing it in separate volumes.Not a good idea.I was about to reserve my long-awaited copy until I read the reviews.I will wait a while and buy it used on Amazon or eBay after it's release-unless Paramount see the light and release the full series 3 as a package.We get ripped off enough here in the U.K and won't put up with the same treatment from the U.S
1,swift kick in the buttocks,"consumers should say NO to split seasons. let paramount learn a lesson so this doesnt turn into seasons that are split even more. of course they have a right to make a buck, but this is over the top. i love the 80's soaps, but you know what? i decided to go for dallas instead.maybe if they made shows nearly as compelling as dynasty nowadays they wouldnt have to ATTEMPT to squeeze every lost dollar out of loyal fans.wait until paramount realizes they have to respect the consumer and then buy it when they re-release them as single seasons. shame on paramount."
1,Do not split up sets,Nobody wants the season split into 2 sets. Release entire seasons entact. I will not buy this split season.
1,Typical,"Here we go again. Yet another mystery to solve. We can speculate why ""the man"" do these stupid things, but we will never get an answer. I love this show, and Knots Landing, but I doubt we will ever see them complete on DVD. After all, why bother? At least we have THE COMPLETE series run of such a stellar classic like Full House to watch. Or Punky Brewster, or for that matter any of the other mysteries out there. Who makes these decisions and why? Why do we even care? Like many I will not buy a partial season. They must think we are utter idiots. No, they DO think that."
3,Interesting Twists,As a mental health professional it was a interesting read. A few theories regarding Schizophrenia have changes since the 1980's but still a fun read. If you enjoy a twisting mystery with a background of old money and mental illness you will enjoy this book.
5,golden oldie,"The copyright date on this Alex Delaware novel is 1987. I had not realized the series was that old ~~ or Dr Delaware, for that matter.Even then, at the beginning of the series, the writing is fluent and well thought out. The plot is carefully planned, with a lot of interesting ideas to ponder as you follow the story.Something that interests me: I really enjoy Kellerman's work, but in the last couple additions to the Dr D series, I have been able to spot the Bad Guy the moment he appears on the scene. I can't put my finger on what it is, but there is something that tips me off right away. (You can probably tell I have read a lot of Kellerman's books. They're all good!)However, Over the Edge kept me guessing right up to the end, with extra unexpected surprises. As I have suggested in another review, maybe the author, like the villains he writes so vividly about, falls into patterns that give him away.Never mind all that, just read and enjoy!"
5,One Of His Best,"I haven't read all of Jonathan Kellerman's books and usually lose interest three quarters of the way through, but I found Over The Edge great right through the perfect ending. The main characters come across as very believeable, although the secondary cops and bad guys seemed stereotpyed. I found myself fitting into Alex Delaware's thought patterns with no trouble and I managed to hang on through all the plot twists without getting lost or bored. I think the only parts I skipped were his long descriptions of people and places. My one real annoyance with the book was that the reader didn't get to know Jamey better, because I would have liked to."
2,Pretentious? Vous?,"Listen, I basically like the plots of these stories and the action. But poor Alex himself is getting so pretentious, he's verging on the insufferable! He has a house in the ""Hills"" with a deck and a koi pond, he cooks like a Cordon Bleu grad, drives a classic (restored by himself) Porsche. He can tell you the designer of any woman's dress he spots on Rodeo Drive, he drops the name of every cool jazz icon known to man, he has a live-in (and perfect, of course)lover that makes custom guitars for rock stars (whose workshop is in Venice!)... I mean, C'mon! This poor ... goes through the gamut of cliched pretense like Sherman through a goose! Sam Spade would dump a beer on his head. Lucas Davenport would toss him in his koi pond. Yikes! What an unbelievable fop!"
1,"May 25, 2010 is not the original release date","After only a few pages into the story it was obviously a much older book than what Amazon states as a release date. There were no cell phones, computers were vastly limited, and smoking occured everywhere including at the crime scene and in the hospital. This was a flash from the past. I hate paying premium prices for an older edition. Common Amazon... get with the program."
4,"Entertaining, Captivating","Complex mystery with entertaining visits to a cross section of LA life. Milo at his moodiest best, so Alex must go it alone for most of this latest adventure."
5,Impossible to Put Down,"This is my favorite Jonathan Kellerman novel so far, out of about eight, perhaps. Let me just give you the reasons why I liked it so much. The plot was well thought-out and there was no ""wasted space."" Slightly out there as far as plausibility is concerned, but still possible. The characters were well-developed and that can be the most crucial thing of all in a book like this with lots of details that eventually need to be pieced together. There were some ""clues"" throughout the book but not too obvious to guess every nuance along the way. There were some ""twists"" at the end that I hadn't expected. More than anything, I was very pleased with the PACE of the book and how well everything was tied together. A lot of thought and planning went into this story. Very satisfying."
3,Ok but not the best from Kellerman,I have been reading all of the Alex Deleware books in order and actually had a hard time finding this one. The story intself will keep you interested. There is A LOT of technical jargon and big words used when talking about different types of drugs. If you can get past all that and get the main point it is a nice little book. Not one of his best but he is still better then most authors.
4,Over thr Edge,"This started out as a different type of Alex Delaware novel , but it picked up toward the latter half."
1,Very disappointed.,"Very disappointed. Final two cassettes did not play. This was for my elderly blind mother who was truly enjoying the novel, only to find the last two cassettes were garbled."
4,Mind catcher of a book,"This was the 4th book I read of Kellerman's. I found it to be very interesting, it kept my mind going. I thought some of the technical lingo was hard to pronounce and understand. I thought the overall book was excellent, but at times I wished I had a medical dictionary to be able to pronounce some of the words. I ran across Kellermans books by accident, but I am hooked on them now."
4,Good detective story - but too much technical shrink stuff,"This is the third in Jonathan Kellerman's series of detective novels featuring psychologist Alex Delaware. So far, this has been a great series, and this book is no exception. I just wish that Mr. Kellerman hadn't gone into so much detail about the psychological information he presents in his book - that put me to sleep REAL fast.This story's been done before - but never quite in this way. The plot was totally believable, although the character of Souza the lawyer wasn't - he seemed to be too pompous to be true. But Delaware does ring very true, as does his policeman buddy, Milo Sturgis.I know that a new Alex Delaware novel has just come out - I look forward to reading it, but I prefer to read series in order, so I don't miss anything. I just hope that Kellerman de-emphasizes the research in the rest of his books. I grant that it's important, but he should know when enough is enough."
3,not as exciting,"It was ok, I have read better books by this author, it started out exciting but then bogged down, easy to figure out the villians"
5,Flats Begone,I cycle approx 100 to 150 miles per week. On average I was having 1 to 2 flats every time I rode. I installed this tire and have ridden over 1000 miles without a flat. The only problem the super fast flat change out skills I had prior to buying the tire have gotten rusty. Great tire...
5,Great tough tires!,"After having 3 flats on a metric century ride in the middle of nowhere I knew I needed to upgrade my older tires. I wanted to get tires that were super tough but still rolled fast. The reviews on the GatorSkins made me select these above other brands I was considering. Someone had described these as bullet proof which after the 3 flat disaster I was more than swayed. I have been riding with these tires for about 3 months and I absolutely love them. I don't notice any loss of speed with the thicker tires and I, knock on wood, haven't had a flat. I did another metric century and have put many training miles on them in the 3 months. I would recommend these for great tough tires. I am very very happy!"
2,"Fast and Light, but Frequent Flats","While these tires are quite light, they lack durability and puncture protection and should be avoided for long distance events. From reading the other reviews, I expected these tires to last longer than the 2500 miles I got out of each. In that time, I experienced 7 flats and sidewall damage due to a branch on the road. From my experience from other tires, I've found the performance of these tires to be less than desired.Considering the main selling points for this tire are the supposed puncture resistance and durability, I found that I had ended up wasting $100 for less than a season of use. I've used Specialized Armadillos in the past and I've gotten 11,000 mi (still going for over 2 years) in the front and 4,500 mi in the rear.The best thing going for these tires is their weight and road ""stickiness."" Therefore, these tires are probably best suited for low to medium distance racing/training rides and should be avoided for randonneurs and touring."
3,Good flat protection; poor cosmetics,"Have been riding on these Ultra Gatorskins for about two years and several thousand miles. Excellent flat protection. Here in Phoenix there are plenty of thorns to worry about and debris on the roadway. But even riding through broken glass (not intentionally) I have had no flats.However, (there's always a however) the sidewalls suck. The cosmetic covering material, the crosshatch stuff, starts coming loose after around a thousand miles. I ended up trimming it off because it literally flaps in the wind and catches on the brake pads. Problem is, the information on the tire such as inflation pressure is now lost. Functionally the tire is still great but cosmetically it bites."
5,Good Tyres,"I've been commuting with these for the last six months or so and they're great.. I ride through industrial areas with gravel, glass, shards of metal all over the road. These tires power through all that stuff. They still can be punctured, I've had goatheads get through them, but they are much more resistant than your average tire. I run the slime tubes too and they take care of the goatheads that have gotten through. Mainly the only flats I've gotten are pinch flats, my fault for underinflating. They also grip the road really well I've rode on really wet roads with them and they do ok for a smooth tire and they roll real nice.. Yeah good stuff.."
2,bad puncture resistance,The tire is grippy on wet asphalt. But it's too fragile. I've got a through puncture after 3 commute rides. It was a piece of glass. While examining I've found a lot of surface punctures. I used 3 different brands among gatorskin. All 3 are better in terms of number of surface defects. May be it's the tradeoff for grippyness -- the rubber of gatorskin is softer and more elastic.I bought pair of gatorskins for commuting in winter when it rains. A lot of debris at expressways shoulders I ride. These ones don't work for me.
4,Good product,I've run some pretty cheap tires over the years and decided to bite the bullet and get something that would be longer lasting. It's too early to comment on the long lasting piece but they ride nice. I have noticed that the rear tire wears more quickly than the front so I will rotate them in the near future. Perhaps this should be a normal maintenance action anyway.
5,Best training tires out there,"If you use different tires for training and racing, these are the tires to have for high mileage training. They're heavy, slightly slower, and don't corner as well as a typical racing tire, but they last forever and I've never had a flat on one. I have 23c and 25c versions of this tire, and the 23c has stiffer sidewalls and corners better, but the 25c feels plush on rough roads by comparison, so choose based on riding conditions, but also check your frame clearance as some newer frames are too narrow to run a 25c without risking it rubbing the chainstay."
4,Durable road tires,"I have 700x25 tires for road bike. I've had these tires for 2 year and have about 2000 miles on them. I've had one flat on the road. I ran over a sliver of something that penetrated the tire. I felt this sliver on the inside of the tire while changing it on the road. I purchased the foldable version which weighs a bit less. Most of my riding is commuting and on roads where there is traffic. They do sweep the roads around here, but there's still a good amount of crap in the road. I've only ridden on dry pavement so I can't attest to wet vs dry performance. I also haven't ridden on lots of different tires to be able to comment on the feel. But overall I'm happy with these tires and would not hesitate to purchase them again. I can't give them five stars because I have not had them long enough to see how they hold up. But so far they are nice tires."
5,Good road bike tires,I've only had these tires for a month but haven't had any problems yet. Like all road bike tires they are difficult to get on. The tires are noticeably heaver then my old road bike tires but that is to be expected for tires that will resist flats.
5,Great tire! Will use these indefinately,"While I only cycle about 1,000mi/yr, everyone hates flats. Not only do you waste a $5 tube, have to stop your ride, get dirty and waste time; flats also add a bit of fear or mental risk to riding. My previous tires are Michelin Krylon Carbons, which are pretty good and about the same price point. I didn't notice a significant weight or ride difference, but the gatorskins are every bit as hard to mount on my wheels.Have not had a flat yet on my 2 gatorskin equipped bikes, roughly 1k miles. Before I averaged a flat every 300mi or so.Remember to fill to 100psi+ to avoid pinch flats. No tire can completely prevent these, it is your job."
5,Totally impressed,"I really didn't need new tires yet, but I thought I might be better off if I replaced my stock tires with an upgrade. I went wider than my original tire (I'm around 200-210 lbs. You know you have a quality product when you get these out of the box. They are a more rugged material so it take more effort mounting than your typical tire, but I think they will be worht it. Supper impressed."
5,Put it on with peace of mind,"This tire is has served me well for three years now. I ride fixed and I went through the whole ""skid to show off"" phase back in high school and this thing still hasn't given me a flat except when I destroyed my back wheel due to a gnarly pothole. I don't really know how many miles I put on this tire but three years of frequent rides to the beach (22 miles round trip), to and from school (college), with only one flat? I'm sold. Rolling resistance is low on this tire compared to the Kenda that was on it before. Very well constructed. I would definitely buy it again if need be but this tire just won't give up. It's starting to show some age because the gatorskin design on the sides are peeling off I don't know if it's supposed to do that but I know the tire has a good amount of life left. BUY THIS TIRE."
1,poor quality,"After less than 500 miles, bead wore through housing and started eating tubes like candy. Such poor quality is surprising from Continental.I also noticed that the tire design is similar but different from another Gatorskin bought in store. Could this be counterfeit stuff? Just speculation at this point.I still think Gatorskin are good tires, but I'll stay away from Amazon for now."
1,Hate em!!,"I replaced my old cheap tires with these rediculously expensive tires ($50 each) hoping to get less flats. I'm a bicycle commuter and ride 28 miles per day on urban streets. Flats just come with the territory on my commute, but honestly I'm getting more flats now than I ever have with these tires and I paid 3 times more. I've had 10 flats in the past 3 months! The majority were from punctures, but now I'm starting to get pinch flats because the bead is now damaged. That leads me into the other thing I hate about these tires, the wire bead is so tight that changing a flat is harder than ever! It's just a matter of time before the bead is damaged. I've even broken a few levers trying to take off these mothers. Avoid these tires like the plague! Take it from someone who has put them to the true test. They're definitely not worth the money! Go with armadillos or shwalbes all the way. I've always had good success with those tires. They're expensive, but they're actually worth the extra money."
1,Worst Tires Ever,"I bought two of these for front and back in addition to tire liners (yes, needed desperate flat protection).First on all, Tire liners did _nothing_. period.The first tire had a large 1.5"" gash in the side of the tire. (QA problem?) But, both are worthless and did less than nothing to protect against flats. I might as well have been riding on tubes!(These flats were _not_ pinch flats, but from unavoidable glass and such). Before each ride I inspect my tread & I keep my bike @ 90-100 PSI (these are rated for 120).Furthermore I was unable to get any English support, only German.Wish I could recommend to everyone some other tire product."
1,Lousy,"They should call this the ""Onion Skin,"" because that's about the amount of protection they offer. I got a thorn flat within 2 weeks of installation.What a joke!!!"
4,bicycle tires,"due to surgery I have not been able to use these tires yet,but I have purchased tires from this merchant before and they have good prices and fast shipment.I now have them in favorite places."
1,My Last Gatorskin,"I used Gatorskins in the past, but after two sidewall blowouts, I changed to Armadillos. A few months ago I decided to try a Gatorskin again as I heard they had fixed their infamous sidewall problem. Yesterday on a ride, another blowout. Yup, on the sidewall of the Gatorskin after about 2500 miles on it. That was number three. No more Gatorskins for me."
2,I still get a ton of flats.,I excitedly bought these tires from my local bike shop after seeing the glowing reviews on Amazon. I'm sad to report that these $40 tires (each!) are only marginally better than the cheap tires I used to ride. I've had three puncture flats in about 800 miles which is about the same as my old ones. These tires are also extremely difficult to mount because of the wire bead.The one thing that I do like about them is that I can run them at 120psi which really lowers the rolling resistance.
4,gatorskins in the desert,Great for desert riding where all the plants have sharp bits that end up on the road...no flats so far this year.
5,Simply Timeless,"Simply timeless, ""Adventures in Odyssey"" continues to entertain and educate children on godly character decade after decade. I remember listening to the show on 88.5FM KLJC. Twenty years later, not only do I enjoy listening to ""Adventures in Odyssey"" with my own daughter, but we also enjoy watching the cartoon together. ""Race to Freedom"" is an epic tale that children will enjoy for years to come."
1,The title is misleading,The music on these 3 CDs has nothing in common with Cuba or the cafe. No Cuban sounds or rhythms here. A lame collection of mediocre music.
5,What a treat!,"Fresh and highly sensitive playing of unknown jewels from the classic period, this recording uses period instruments to great effect and will be a revelation to anyone not familiar with the mandolin and fortepiano.BB"
1,Unqualified,"I agree with C's review. This author is not qualified to offer advice on dating and relationships. Most of the personal examples she uses in this book are about the men who cheated on her when she was still in the dating trenches: and she writes that there were many. However, she didn't adhere to her own ""Dateworthy"" advice to work through these issues. She married a man who leads a double life and cheats on her with multiple women. The author's personal choices aside, she comes across as very condescending in this book. She frequently talks about what she looks like in an insecure way (she seems to have body issues) but then very meanly describes many of the men she's dated in negative physical terms. In conclusion, one has to consider the source when considering the advice inside this book."
1,Author is not credible,It's ironic this author has written this book to help women have better relationships when her own marriage is a sham and her husband has been cheating for years.
2,I need to re read it again,While she does have some incite into what is wrong with women. I do not think it all women who have done the wrong in relationships.... I hate the whole WOMEN fix yourself then a man will want you idea. And this feeds right into it. It seems to zap the power of the women to accept themselves alone. I would love to read one of these books written for men... that tell them that if they fix themselves then women will die for them. I would not suggest any women read this book. You are not single because there is something wrong with you but because you havent met the right man. Just that simple.
3,cardboard frames,"Ordered a pack of ten plain, little frames, but forgot to check the s&h cost. Wow! If you really, really need some of these and don't mind paying an outragiously high s&h, go ahead and get them. But, as I discovered after they arrived, the local 99-cent store has much nicer ones for half the cost I ended up paying per item for these."
4,Stylish & Practical,"All in all this phone does the job.Downside,not bluetooth enabled & picture quality is only slightly better then a pre 90's cheap camera.I use this in construction and have dropped it twice in concrete,once on 3' of water and to many times to count on the ground.Never any problems(even in the water just turned off,dryed out and good as new).If not for the camera and bluetooth features it would easy be 5 stars."
3,cool design - lo battery life/many clicks,did my homework & this phone had very high reviews on cnet...disappointed by battery life and speaker SO sensitive that it seems poor quality. hard to pick up accessories - have to say it's a FUN phone and I haven't been anywhere yet where I can't get a signal.
1,bad,"Kyocera make the worst phone in the world. Don't touch it, otherwise I am sure you will regret as I did. I really admire those Kyocera people who can make phones so bad."
1,Coffee favored water if you only make 4 cups,"What I like: boiling hot water in addition to making coffeewhat I don't like: doesn't make good coffee if you want to get only 4 cupsthe flat bottom filter dramatically reduces the ""retention time"" of hot water in the coffee-filled filter. Although I increase the amount of coffee ground by 100%, the coffee is still not strong. I have tried making 8 cups, and the coffee is getting better/stronger, but I cannot finish 8 cups in half day. I guess I will get a new one with a cone shape filter."
2,MamaO3,"I loved this coffee maker, tremendously! I used it daily for less than 1 yr., and now, it just shorted out. I couldn't be more disappointed. You're better off purchasing a cheaper, more reliable brand coffee maker."
4,Note to Paul T York,Dear PaulI had the same problem with the leaking coffee maker and I called Waring. I was amazed at how helpful they were. I had no proof of purchase and I told them that the pot was probably over a year old. Nonetheless they replaced it for me. I had to pay the postage to have it sent to them but all in all I was delighted with what I assumed to be a total loss. So maybe you ought to contact them if you still have the pot. Otherwise We love it.
1,Leaks like a sieve,"We had this coffee maker for about three months when it began leaking ever so slightly. After six months, pour ten cups in, get eight in the carafe and two on the counter top. After doing a little research it appears this is a common problem with this coffee maker with no evidence of a good fix. Other symptomatic issues include regular tripping of the GFI circuit breaker and the need to constantly refill the reservoir because the little blue warning light keeps coming on. Back to a Bunn coffee maker for us. Waring had a good idea, but didn't seem to be able to follow through with quality."
5,Insightful into the Nature of Prayer,This has been one in a series of books I have read on prayer and found it to be both inspirational and practical. I would recommend the reading of this book to anyone who desires to cultivate a deper awareness of the presence of God in ones life.
2,Quiet Talk on Prayer,"His sentences were so long that I lost my train of thought before the sentence ended. Although I had to make myself stick to finishing the book, it was worth it, because every so often he said something very profound. I think that there might be a book on the subject of prayer that is simplier to read."
2,Not so good,I did not like these. I bought them for a wedding cake and they were too thin and small to support the cake fully.
3,ok,"These dowel rods are great for multiple things, but these were too skinny for what I needed to use them for. The picture is good but I think there should be a few more."
3,Good... . but not as good,"As a very well satisfied reader of Hoffman's two earlier books, I was overjoyed to find this one. Unfortunately she goes too far in the fantasy department for me. I can suspend belief so far as to accept ghosts,magic and presences but when never-antimate things communicate with the living it's too much. If you have not read the other Hoffman books treat yourself to them first."
4,A Magical Read,"I've not read many adult fantasy novels, but if this any indication of what I've been missing I'll read more. Not a lot more, but some. Once I was able to get used to the fact that the bizarre is usual and no one the characters encounter is bothered by this, I quit being bothered and began to truly enjoy the novel. The magic is fun -- wish I had some ""gold"" -- I think!"
5,e book,why isnt this available for the kindle??? the second book is. Why are only some of these author's books available. when the hardware version is expensive and difficult to obtain.... I enjoy all of the books by this author and want to have the flexibility to have them on my kindle.
4,Great contemporary fantasy,"Matt (Matilda) Black has been drifting from town to town, away from home, polite society, and her past, when she meets Edmund, a wandering witch who has a bit of an identity problem. Matt uses her magical gift of speaking with inanimate objects to make friends with a ghost of a haunted house (the ghost happens to be an old friend of Edmund's), who starts Edmund and Matt on the journey to recover Edmund's lost memories. An imaginative, engaging, and well-written urban fantasy that made me seek out Hoffman's other books."
3,What an unexpected treat!,"Normally a mystery fan, I don't know what prompted me to purchase this book, but I'm glad I did. It was one of my first tries at fantasy, and it was totally enjoyable. The main character, Matt, is able to communicate with inanimate objects. She meets a guy named Edmund who happens to be a witch. They travel together to Edmnund's hometown and then leave there to find one of Edmund's childhood friends in order to put to rest something that happened when they were teenagers. I liked the storyline and the characters, and Matt's ability to communicate with inanimate objects was enjoyable. I will definitely try another of her books."
2,i love cardcaptors~*,"I would definitly buy the un-cut japenese verison instead because in this video they cut alot of senes out so it doesnt really make sense...but i love cardcaptors!! best show in the world, but just make sure u buy the uncut videos"
5,great childhood memory,"I must disagree completly with the other reviewer!Did he read this book as a child or an adult?I am 57 and read and loved this book when I read it at 10 years of age.I still have very fond memories of this book , which is why I looked it up on Amazon."
2,Certainly strange!,"Certainly one of the strangest science-fiction juveniles I have ever read. Not only is the science nonexistent, and the narrative (deliberately) chaotic, but also almost all of the illustrations have a kinky and disturbing sexual charge... the ""good"" Martians look like upright baseball bats with clusters of pubic hair in various places, and the ""bad"" Martians look precisely like gigantic, thick phalluses arising vertically out of a huge nest of pubic hair. The three stowaway kids along for the adventure are depicted with completely ambiguous sexuality. There is essentially no plot, and very little action, until a final ""battle"" between the baseball bats and the bad guys. The pseudonymous author, ""Cross,"" was best known, I think, for short stories with a supernatural theme. It's hard to believe that this novel had at least one sequel, THE RED JOURNEY BACK, published about 10 years later. I haven't seen it and am almost afraid to search it out!"
3,Needs Updating,"When this book was first published in 1956, it undoubtedly was one of the best books on the subject. Unfortunately, even though this is called the Third Revised Edition, it is not clear in what way this book has been updated. It contains the preface to the first edition, but no new preface or introduction is added for the third edition.It does include a ""Corrigenda and Addenda to the Second Edition"" after the main body of texts, but the question is: Why weren't these addenda included in the text instead of put outside of the main text, and where are the addenda for the third edition? To make matters worse, the second edition addenda information uses page numbers that do not align with the third edition publication.There is still a lot of valuable information in this book, but it is important for the buyer to be aware of what they are actually getting when they purchase it."
3,dated but useful,"Though professional or student archeologists interested or working in the field of ancient Mesopotamian studies may find much here to be dated, this, one-time, very infuential book is still well worth the read by the academic nonspecialist or member of the educated lay public. As such, I found the book to be a very useful resource when I recently edited my own work about the history of southern Iraq: ""Wetlands of Mass Destruction: Ancient Presage for Contemporary Ecocide in Southern Iraq"""
1,Price Review,"I hoped that this listing was a joke, you can buy a bottle of this for $4.37 at Walmart. How is charging $15 a value?!!"
1,Over priced.,"Had I known this sold for only $5 at the store, I would NOT have paid $16 for it. Live and learn, I guess. I will not buy from here again."
1,The shipping charge is a rip-off,"The price on this item is fair, but the shipping charge is ""easy money"" for the seller. Use google and you will find free shipping with the same price."
3,BLURRY......................,"The book is full of information, but sanskrit is bad on the eyes to begin with, so it doesn't help at all to have micro-print so small that the character's ""blot"" together."
5,F/X 2 The Deadly Art Of Illusion,I have always enjoyed watching F/X 1 & 2. I like the actors and the special effects.
4,F/X 2 is a great ingenious movie with plot and action!,F/X 2 is a great ingenious film with plot and action! F/X 2 stars Brian Brown and Brian Dennehy as Rollie Tyler and Leo McCarthy and they are together for one last adventure to stop Mob from stealing gold Medilians from Vadican embassy in intaly!Great film! Very inventive and well thought out! I Like this movie despite what the movie critics thought about this fim in 1991! I wish there was an F/X 3 but unfortunatly that didn't happen. Despite what others say the movie great and is better then the original movie from 1986. Go find it! It's great movie!
2,Dismal,"If you've seen the superior Diana Rigg Megaset, these early shows might require a clothes pin on the nose. Poor quality (early video tape), poor story lines, little action, little suspense, little entertainment value."
3,Fun for a kids Christmas party,"I purchased this for a Christmas carol sing-a-long party at a local charity. Even though the music is a little cheesy, after all it is karaoke, the kids (ages 3-12) had a good time singing old favorites like Frosty, Rudolph and of course Jingle Bells.The 4 CD was worth it for a party that was about 3 hours long. I would recommend using this particular set with a karaoke machine so the lyrics to the music could be visible to the singer or audience."
4,Almost Close to Perfect!!,"I found this product to be very helpful during the Christmas season. I like the fact that the product had the songs with and without the vocal guides; however, a few of the songs had the back-up singers singing the whole entire song on both of the tracks of the same song."
3,Party Time Karaoke Christmas Party Pack,"This has a nice selection of songs for religious or not events - what I was looking for. The only problem with the CD's by this maker is that at least a few of the tracks where voice should be removed, voice is included."
4,Karaoke Christmas Party,A Fun family way to sing together without having to be a pianist. The kids will enjoy this CD the most.
2,Okay but not great,I wanted to be able to sing along with this -- but it was rather difficult. Bought it for a party where we always sing Christmas songs. It really didn't work and we just used it for background music.
3,"okay, nothing special","The book revolves around its artwork, and this is only passable artwork. The perspective is a little distracting. But, hey, it's not a bad little book, illustrating forms of transportation -- tugboat, rodeo bull, etc."
3,progressive pop?,"These guys can play and sing, but this is NOT a progressive metal album. Though described as prog metal several places on the internet, the album is closer to Air Supply or Journey than metal of any sort. If you like a bright, somewhat tinny sound, and mix emphasis on the vocals, you might like this a lot. The talent is there, but only a few cuts (late in the album) try for a prog metal approach, and those fall short. A boomer who remembers the old, prog band Starcastle would enjoy this band- it sounds SO early 80's. If you are looking for pro metal (with the real emphasis on a European prog sound) try the Polish band Riverside. If you like lighter music, this may be your cup of tea."
5,Fantastic.,"After stumbling upon this band via a popular video site, I felt I needed get on Amazon to pick up the album right away. Was I ever in for a treat. I've had this disc rotating in my CD player since the day it arrived. Great music for: Progressive music lovers, Heavy Metal music lovers, musicians looking for inspiration and anyone who has curiosity in expanding their musical interests. A real Gem."
4,Delving into Mayan Medicine.,"Interesting aspect of Mayan medicine, from a Chicago Doctor who became a shaman in Belize, Central America. For someone interested in natural medicine, this is a must read."
4,very interesting !,Anyone interested in alternative med should read.I have Endometrosis and considering the Arvigo massage. But wanted to get all the background I could before begin another venture of trying to help my pain. This gives me alot of background to work with.I recommend this book.
5,"Well-written, interesting, important book","I picked up this book after visiting Ix Chel Farm and purchasing some ""Rainforest Remedies."" The book was very well-written and extremely interesting, offering valuable lessons about traditions, the environment, and the importance of both."
2,Cue the violins...,"This was some of the most self-serving, melodramtic drivel I've read, well, ever. I usually put garbage like this aside, but I'd just been to Belize and promised a friend I'd read it."
5,Great Cd!!,I saw this the other day when i was shopping and i had to check it out.So when i got home i went to my room and poped it in and it was a very good cd.I loved it great job Kelly!I liked it better than those Destiny's Child Cd's not that they are bad singer but everything revolves around Beyonce.I mean it's a trio and her name is all i ever hear.Next cd they do i hope that Kelly and Michelle get to sing lead on some songs for once.Everyone should buy this this is a great cd.
4,Karen's Review of Simply Deep,"It's official. Beyonce is not the only member of Destiny's Child with a great voice. While this album is not as good as a DC album, fans will be impressed greatly by Kelly's vocals. Highlights on this album for me were her deut with Nelly Dilemma, Stole, (Love Lives In)Strange Places, Everytime You Walk Out The Door and Beyond Imagination. If you're a DC fan, or even if you're not, I definitely recommend this album to you."
4,Simply Outstanding,"When I heard Kelly Rowland was coming out with her own solo CD, i was happy because I believe she has been in Beyonce's shadow. What i love about Kelly is that she sings and doesnt try to outdo herself like how Beyonce just shouts and wails out of her range. This album is very R&B definitely worth to listen to. I love the songs ""Past"", ""Everytime you walk through that door"", ""Cant nobody"", and ""Simply Deep"". I hope Kelly does well on her own, she deserves this. Overall this album is terrific if you love good R&B. On a sadder note, the fact that Matthew Knowles (Beyonce's father)had the stupid decision to put his other daughter Solange's promo picture on the back inside of the booklet in the CD is pathetic promotion for her and makes me loathe the Knowle's family even more."
3,ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT,"While Kelly has shown she can get a number one outside DC, this album might be a bit of a disapointment if ur looking for some RnB with depth. I was excited about getting this album 'cause of 'Stole'. The emotional expression on this makes u want to stop what ur doing and do some expressing of ur own. However, the rest of the album can be described as shallow (just a bit). Too much talk of love, we've heard it all before and it's time for a new angle on. (What is up with Strange Places???) Mind u, Train on A Track, Obsession and Simply Deep have made the effort to do this. The rock edge definitely did wonders for the album where thin lyrics killed it a bit. Perhaps Kelly should try writing a bit more, we always feel it more if it's from the heart. Overall; it's a good one for getting ready to go out, getting ready in the morning, but not when things get REAL bad!!!! (u'll just get annoyed)."
2,i dont know why but....,i really do not know why but even though everyone else likes this album i kinda dont she is really talented and has a good voice but i just didnt like the songs the only song i liked was cant nobody
4,Don't sleep on Kelly!,"First of all, to anyone that thinks that Kelly can't sing, do me a favor-go and cut off your ears and donate them to science, because you obviously have no use for them at all. I am really late on this one, because I just picked up the album, and I am not at all disappointed. While I do feel that the production on a couple of songs fall short, Simply Deep does a good job of maintaining a level of consistency throughout the project. I really can appreciate an artist who is willing to take risks and experiment with different musical styles. Kelly does a good job with the material she was given on this album. I do, however, wish that there were more songs worthy of being singles. That may have helped the album sales a little more. I like most of the material, but my favorites are Love/Hate, and Everytime you walk out that door. The groove of this album is definitely smooth, and I look forward to hearing more from Kelly in the future."
5,simply incredible!,"do yourself a favor and check this record out, hot uptempos, thought provoking mids and ballads that pull at your heart strings! especially the beautiful ""everytime you walk out the door"" put that one on repeat! ""stole"" and ""cant nobody"" also shine! loving this album!"
1,Simply Dumb!!!,"This album should be banded from musics stores!I hated it it.She did a bad job. And should be ashamed.I recommend Michelle Williams and Beyonce CD's, though.Michelle Williams:*****starsBeyonce:****stars"
2,Thoroughly Disappointed,"I can't believe Kelly's beautiful voice was wasted on an album like this. Besides Dilemma and Stole, I liked about 2-3 other songs. I am glad my cousin gave me this and I didn't buy it with those other cds because this one would have messed up my good ratings I had for the other ones. Simply Deep could have been so much more , but it was Simply Trash."
3,the songs aren't equal to the singer,"I've suspected for some time that the most powerful singer in Destiny's Child (just as Florence Ballard was in the Supremes) was Kelly Rowland and this CD proves it. However, except for ""Stole"" and the cute ""Dilemma"" the songs just aren't good enough. This is a nice R&B album if you need pleasant background music for a dinner party or if you want to relax on the couch after work. That's about it. Hopefully enough people will be impressed enough with Kelly's pure, rich vocals that she'll get a second album. She's talented, she's got a real R&B voice, now all she needs are some decent radio worthy songs."
1,SIMPLY MESSY,THIS ALBUM WAS RUSHED AND SHE AINT SINGING TO HER FULL POTENTIAL....... TRY AGAIN KELLY THIS COULD HAVE BEEN YOUR CHANCE
3,"Well, who would have thought it??","It just goes to show. You hear of bands splitting up and the person that you LEAST expected to make it ends up shocking everyone in the process. I don't know whether DC have split up but this album will definitely open doors for Kelly. We should see her doing duets with more mature singers soon. I'm glad that she has done an album. She didn't look capable of breaking out by herself. I thought DC or nothing. i'm glad, she's doing her own thing. I don't care what anyone says (she included) she and Michelle were running the risk of being backing singers. Her album isn't exactly my thing but all power to her for having the courage to do one by herself at all."
4,Kelly's Solo Attempt!,"I like this CD. She has a diffrent vibe from the 'Destiny's Child' regular sound. She is much less Hip-Hop and more R&B/Rock. I think she made her own category insted of doing the whole fall into one catergory. Thius album will appeal to old and young, black & white because of all the diversity. The songs are well written and well sung. Kelly has a good solo voice and does much better without Beyonce's yelling going on in the foreground! I like mostlky all of the songs on here and only a few made me take away one star. Don't get discouraged by the last sentence because you may like the songs I don't like."
2,Can Anyone Say VOCAL LESSONS,"Okay. Kelly is great with Destiny's Child. Her voice blends well with Beyonce and Michelle's but by herself... this isn't good. I bought this CD because Stole is one of my favorite songs EVER and the packaging is nice... I could've saved fifteen dollars and bought the single. Simply Deep is one of the worst CDs I've ever bought. Stole is seriously the only impressive song on here. Of course there's Dilemma but I was tired of that last year. Kelly's voice is so- not there. I mean I could've sang these songs and it would have sounded better. I don't get why this CD received good reviews. Hello? Has anyone noticed that she can't sing? Well, okay, she can sing but her voice is annoying- to me anyway. For example, on her hit Can't Nobody she actually sounds sick. Wait, maybe she was just making me sick with her vomit inducing tone. The point is: don't buy this."
3,A good kind of different,"Kelly's CD is pretty awesome. I really like her style on this one---kind of alternative/rock/r&b all wrapped into one. She turns out a beautiful array of tunes. Though in some of the lyrics, she seems a little confused about love...but at that age who wouldn't be? All in all I thought the album was great. It has a unique feel---a quality I can definitely appreciate, and good for one who's definitely trying to distinuish themself from Beyonce'."
2,1 star 4 STOLE and another 4 the HOTNESS,"thankfully she did something with that hair if only she had it like that for the cd pic. kelly is the best member of dc because she is real not phony like beyonce how she pretends to act nice and fires her tight backup members toya and tavia. kelly sound kind of like monica. i love her personality she is so sweet! i give this one star for Stole because its a great song. i love the message and her voice sounds gr8. the rest is wack beacuse its exec producer is mathew knowles and he forced her to work with him not hot producers like timbaland, the neptunes, p diddy, darkchild even babyface & wtf is beyonces sister doing on there cant we have destinys child stay out of her career for once. i love kelly and want to be her bf because she is so beautiful and has a gr8 personality much better than Beyonce even the late Aaliyah tho Aaliyah is better than Beyonce definately. reccomended"
5,Simply Deep Is Simply Great!,"This is a must own, due to the fact that no one can say that they don't like it. Sure, no one may like the same song but that's what I like. There's a song/style that everyone can like leaving no one unsatisfied.^_^ This is great and if she makes a second album better, or just as good I would be shocked! Personally...I like her way better than Beyonce', but that's just me!"
3,SIMPLY SIMPLY DEEP.,"Simply Deep: Rowland solo debut, was not as mainstream as any Destiny's Child album, but it feature some fine Adult Contemporary Numbers, as well a more deep lyrical clever approach. Of course is obvious that Kelly could do better, we have to wait and wonder for her next solo effort. I felted that the album was oriented in a more ballad-pop way.RATING PER SONG:STOLE ***** (POP)DILEMMA *** (SLOW HIP HOP)HAVEN'T TOLD YOU ***** (AC)CAN'T NOBODY **** (DANCE-R&B;)LOVE/HATE **** (POP-R&B;)SIMPLY DEEP *** (SOUL)LOVE LIVES IN STRANGE PLACES *** (R&B;)OBSESSION ** (JAZZ-R&B;)HEAVEN ** (JAZZ-R&B;)PAST 12 *** (POP-R&B;)EVERYTIME YOU WALK OUT THAT DOOR *** (AC)TRAIN ON A TRACK **** (AC-POP)BEYOND IMAGINATION ** (R&B;)MAKE YOU WANNA STAY ** (HIP HOP)BEST SONG: STOLEWORST SONG: OBSESSION"
4,the only child with destiny,"get this. i cannot stand destinys child as a group because beyonce annoys me and i havent really heard the other girl. but beyonce should get off of her pedestal and learn what its like to be in it for the love of music, and not the fame and fortune. kelly is awesome however and i love this cd because it feels like it was done with heart and soul. i dont think she needs to go back to destinys child because she is awesome all alone."
4,"It's all about ""Stole""","This CD is worth every penny, simply for Kelly's single, ""Stole."" The lyrics make you want to cry, but you just can't stop listening to it. There's been a lot of confusion as to exactly what the stories are about. The three teens are an intelligent nerd who kills HIMSELF at school, a promising dancer/actress who got PREGNANT, and a basketball player with a chance at the NBA who gets shot. A lot of the professional reveiws have been saying it's about teens who didn't put forth the effort to realize their potential...that's ...the song's called ""Stole""...their lives and dreams were stolen from them. It makes you think about your own dreams and how short life can be. If you have a heart, you will love this song. So buy the album."
3,"Is it really ""Simply Deep??""","When I heard that DC was branching off to do solo projects, I, like many thought Bee would ""take over..."" but after I heard ""Simply Deep"", I really thought and still think that Kelly can have Bee a run for her money. I enjoyed the majority of the songs, like ""Obsession"", ""Heaven"" and ""Love Hate""- but most of the songs were a little dry, to say the least. Even Bee's sister, Solange, helped with writing a few of her songs.I think with the right promotion, adn NEW management, Kelly could be a BIGGER star. It's a shame and a waste for her to settle with ""sloppy seconds""- just because she's in a ""group"" with Beyonce'She deserves more recognition than given- I applaude her for her solo debut- and wishes for the best with the future albums...."
5,hotter than beyonce,"unlike beyonce hit and miss solo debut and the disappointing ""destiny fullfilled"" this cd id the best thing to come out of the destiny's child camp since ""bootylicious"".kelly's solo debut is a class affiar from start 2 finish, there isn't 1 duff track here & all deserve the attention of all pop, r&b; and destiny's child fans out there.shame this didnt score higher in the charts or earn kelly as many awards as beyonce, as from the evidence of their solo material kelly truly is the 1 to watch out 4!"
3,Solo Debut,"Kelly Rowland, si bien es una excelente cantante, me parece que en su album ""Simply Deep"" no ha demostrado sus grandes dotes vocales que si se podían apreciar en su participación en Destiny's Child. Rowland ha querido combinar ritmos movidos y algunas baladas, pero ha debido de tratar que en cada uno de sus temas demuestre lo buena cantante que es. Temas como ""Dilemma"" (con Nelly), ""Can't Nobody"" o ""Simply Deep"" (con Solange) solo nos hacen saber que Kelly tiene una voz melodiosa, pero lo que sus fan queríamos es que nos demuestre que tan potente es su voz!Este es un buen disco, ninguna canción es mala, pero en lo que cojea es en ponerle más fuerza a los temas y algo más de sonidos ""serios"" porque ya estamos hartos de melodías cansadas, repetitivas y aburridas.Bien por Kelly por ser un álbum debut."
1,Simply TRASH,Kelly how could you put some mess out like this. I am sorry as much as I love Kelly I can not not believe she would even let them release this trash. All of the tracks sound like filler every last one including the lead single Stole which is also a mess.The only think worth a listen is the song that Solange co-wrote other that that this is mess. Opps and Kelly didn't have a #1 single it was Nelly she was just featured on that song it was never her song because they really wanted Beyonce to do the song. This should have been a bonus CD with Solange or Beyonce album VERY SAD.
5,GReat CD!,"This review is a long time after the release but I did not want to miss out on letting my opinion be written. This CD is quite the crossover CD that I was not looking for. I really didn't know Kelly had that soft rock appeal. Well, she has quietly created a delightful blend of R&B and soft rock with truly meaningful lyrics. Stole, Train on a Track, & Simply Deep, & Love Lives In Strange Places are most noted with this special blend. But this CD definately has staying power and will be replayed many times from my vast collection. She truly made a distinctive presence for herself and I await her second release sometime this SUMMER 2006."
5,Her talent is Simply Deep!!!!!,"I love Kelly on this album. It shows what kind of music she likes to record. This album is relaxing with tracks like, Simply Deep,Heaven,Love lives in strange places,Obssesion, and much more. And her lyrics are deep as well.This album is even better than Beyonce's album. Get this album. I promise you'll like it if you like R&B...peace."
3,Should Of Been Better,"Three of four good songs out of fourteen is not a good album. This could of been better, take out the album fillers and put in more songs like ""Have i Told You"" and ""Obsession"" and you have a bangin CD for Kelly. I think in all the album is listenable ..It can be thrown on an just listened to but not a favorite. I think its not the end for her as a solo artist. If the next one she makes is better..then she is all good.. Its good enough"
3,KELLY SHINES ON HER OWN....3 and 1/2,Kelly has so much talent and she is vershadowed by Beyonce.Her album went a little over gold and it had more potential than that.This girl can SANG..especially now her vocal skills improved even after this was recorded.I cant wait for her to put out another album.These songs..are good..and some of the lyrics are really deep.It is like rock and soul music in the same sentence.A beautiful mixture.Now all she needs to do is learn how to write songs so she can really be making money.The help of Solange was enlisted to write songs.She is cool and shockingly wrote some good lyrics.Every tracks brings something to the table so it creates a beautiful mixture.It really should have gotten more attention than it had.She should have easily sold a good 2 million at the least.MAYBE NEXT TIME...EVEY THOUGH THIS WAS A GOOD ALBUM...I SAY SHOOT IN ANOTHER DIRECTIONOVERALL GRADE 81/100 = B-
4,Short and sweet,This author always gives you a bit of interesting world history as well as a happily ending story. Great for a relaxing read. The book is fairly short and very well written.
1,Get Chakratized!,If you really want to know about ancient Hindu tantra sysytem read The Serpent Power by Arhtur Avalon. The concept of chakra development and use is a very complex and abstract study taken from ancient sanskrit writings. It is an ascetic system that was said to be extremely difficult as well as dangerous. You will get the real story by reading Avalon.
3,Ok Combatives,"To me this manual is ok-not great,but not bad either.There are some good techniques in it that make it a worthwhile addition to your combatives library.The unarmed combat is based on the O'Neal system,which does have some good material,and that alone,makes it worth obtaining a copy."
4,"Nice, compact, hardcover travel journal","The compact size (~5"" X 7"") makes it great for recording any trip. The journal pages are lined, and it has one pocket on the back cover to store mementos of your trip. There are also pages to record your itinerary, and favorite restaurants, hotels, sites."
4,"Wonderful, overlooked film","This is a seriously underrated film, and one which is well worth your time. A group of disparate characters sign up for one of those ""Outward Bound"" type classes, and learn that survival in the wilderness is not about who can get to the top of the heap and win the money, but about who you can rely on to help you stay alive.I love this one. The scenery is incredibly beautiful, and Lance Henriksen plays one of the good guys. Watch for Dermot Mulroney -who met his future wife, Catherine Keener, on this film - looking young and vulnerable as a young punk set on the paths of righteousness by Lance's character. Look for Mark Rolston who played Drake in Aliens as the paranoid leader of the rival survival school. ""They haven't dropped the bomb...yet."" Lots of fun and a nice antidote to all those highly questionable ""real world"" shows."
3,"Grip is ok, batteries are not.","The grip is fine, like other reviewers have said, the plastic feels thinner and cheaper than the Nikon, but, it is a quarter the price of the Nikon so it's to be expected. The batteries simply don't work on a D90. they work fine on a D80, D200, but show up on the D90 as having no charge, even when fully charged. I'm debating weather to keep it and give the batteries to a friend with a D80, or return it and get the Zeikos, which has gotten better reviews as far as feel and build quality."
3,The Jury is still out on this item,"I read the reviews on this item before I purchased it and I have to say that I agree with some that said it adds weight and bulk to the D80 camera (just not sure that is a good thing). I got the one with the 2 extra batterys, so if I end up not using this very much, at least I got some batterys for the money I spent. I did notice that the control wheels on my unit don't always adjust the camera for every click on the wheel, not sure if this will get better with use or not. I tried it just a little, but have taken it off my camera for now. I will probably give it some more time later."
3,A little wide...,"its actually uncomfortable to hold because it is so wide. and it feels cheap. But it gets the job done. And the price is right, plus shipping was extremely fast!"
4,Cheap Plastic but Ga Great Value,"So....this is an excellent value for a couple of new batteries with a grip thrown in for a little bit more money. The trigger shutter button is not very smooth and the plastic feels cheap and light in your hands. But heck, for the money, its a real steal! Like other reviewers have said, ""it does the job you expect of it to do."" Worth it if you need to look cool, have a grip, and do it on a budget. It also works flawlessly with D90."
3,"Good item, awful batteries...",The supplied batteries were dead after 6 months of usage. The item in general is ok and worth the money but you should keep in mind that the batteries are not reliable.
5,Excelent !!!!,Works excelent and is comparable to the more expensive Nikon Brand version for half the cost. Definitely worth the money! Did you see my pictures.
4,surprising how good it is!,"Ok I was skeptical. I thought it would be cheap, but figured it would be worth it just for the batteries. I have not taken it off the camera, I balances very well with the grip on, much better than without with everything except my 50 mm 1.8. (that feels like there is no lens on it at all. The only issues I have with it is that the control wheels are rough feeling, the battery door opens to easy and the on off switch is easy to flip by accident. The battery door not opening is not too bad because unlike the body the batteries are held in with spring loaded tabs. Over all I love it. One thing is that if you have small hands it will be a big thing to grab onto. Batteries seem fine, I had heard of them, unlike Opteka. with the Power 2000 brand so they are what I expected. Life seems to be about the same as Nikon, though I have not actually tested them under controlled tests."
1,How to charge Opteka batteries?,I have not ideas how to charge those two Opteka batteries when I used up the power. it does not fit Nikon charger at all.anyone know how to charge them?
2,it work sometime,"i had this for under two year. use it alot. i got this instead of getting the nikon mb80 because of the price and the extra battery. well i love it. about six month later. i realized that the camera doesn't reconized the battery or unit. maybe both i don't realy know. i had two battery and one nikon battery. sometime it worked realy well other time it doesn't even recognize the nikon battery. everything works quite well without the grip. one other thing is that when i put the opteka on a tripod if i turn the quick release to tight the battery pop out inside the holder. if i don't turn it tight then it be won't be very steady on the tripod. anyway, most of my shotting are done without a tripod. it's working ok right now. very figitty. i'm now willing to spend more for mb80. however, i'm going to keep the battery. the reseason i'm giving it two star is that does work sometime."
1,Back holder not hold battery inside. Battery 40% useful.,Back holder not hold battery inside. Battery 40% useful.I`m very-very upset. Because battery cover dosn`t hold battery inside.And battery REALLY in 40% useful.
1,Batteries,The 2 Opteka EL-EL3s batteries wasn't included and it holds 6 AA batteries not 4.Technical Details* 2 Opteka EL-EL3e 2000 mAh Batteries included* Holds 4 AA Batteries or 2 EL-EL3 batteries
4,"Solid Product, but the dials are stiff","It works as advertised... seems to have taken a little bit of playing with for it to function properly, but once it broke in after a few minutes, all the dials and such registered fine. The only downside is that the command dials, particularly the main command dial is very stiff, which usually requires me to adjust my grip to change it. Not as convenient as it could be, but combined with the batterys included in the package, its a great deal. I charged them both up over two weeks ago, and have yet to see it drop a bar on the meter. I generally use it for an hour or two a day."
5,"Great lift, I wish I had bought it sooner",I'm kicking myself for not getting this sooner. I have a Bosch 1617 EVS and for the longest time used the height adjustment wrench to raise and lower the bits. Changing bits required opening up my router table and bending down to access the router. With this lift I can raise and lower the bit with ease. The crank handle is great! Changing bits is also easy and very time saving now since I can do it above the table. By far this is one of the best purchases I have made for my shop. It saves me time and improves the quality of my work.
4,It's like you're in Baywatch,"I bought this album because I loved the song 'One Sign' and I must say; the album has a lot of songs like it. It's hard to put this album in a category, but if I must it would be dance. It has a nice mid-beat bass, and the ''I'll be ready''-kind of voice that Galleon's lead singer has, makes it feel like you're back in the 90's, watching Baywatch. If you liked that kind of music, you can't miss out on Galleon - So I Begin! Only dissapointment of this album is that the further you progress in this album, the songs get worse. For the overall image of this album, Galleon would have been wiser if they had left the end songs out."
1,"Maybe it was, just, me, but I found the book to be unreadable","I had read the Hobbit and the trilogy of the rings and thought the The Silmarillion would be a worthwhile read. However, I found the book to be unreadable. I am not certain what the author had done differently, but I could not get past the first 40 pages and those pages required serious work to read. It looked as if the author had some very good ideas but he had put it in a manner that was difficult to understand.Perhaps you will do better than I did. However, this was one of only a few books that I could not finish because I had a hard time understanding what the author was communicating.If you are interested in this book, I suggest getting it from a library and trying to read it, before spending money on it."
1,Deep dissapointment,"I will be as terse as possible in the hopes of helping as many others as I can: unless you are looking for the cure for insomnia, avoid this audio book collection at all costs."
1,Yawn...,"Where the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings enchanted me and thirsting for more, The Silmarillion only put me to sleep. What an incredibly boring book."
3,Confusing and confounding,"Certainly a treat for Tolken fans, but hard for the rest of us to interpret."
3,Background,"If you read Lord of the Rings and then read it again, including the appendices, buy this book. If you're looking for a stirring fantasy epic, forget it. I read this 30 years ago; at the time it was billed as JRR's attempt to create the mythology/historical background for his more popular books. It accomplished its assigned task but as far as being great writing in its own right - no. The tale of the two lovers is poignant, but is only a sketch. Not for kids - too boring. Recommended for the Tolkien hard-core fanatic: for them its a must have, obviously. There are two editions floating around with the same illustrator. One has 50+ illustrations, the other 20. I think this one has 50 but Amazon is known to mix things up. Artwork is ok (as stated elsewhere, the landscapes are better)."
3,Too complicated.,After reading the LOTR trilogy and The Hobbit I eagerly went out to read The Sil. The book is so complicated you need to read the book two times just to realize who is who in the book. There are too many characters in the story and many have names so similiar I often found myself so confused. I must commend Tolkien's son for publishing this but he just put too much into one book. This book is only for die hard fans.
5,"The greatest book I've ever read, and ever will read",As many people have said J.J.R. Tolkien's Silmarillion is one of the most creative and imaginative book ever written. The one thing that Tolkien has done that makes the Silmarillion the greatest book ever written is his ability to create an actual world which he supplies with hundreds of characters. Basically he developed a whole history over a world he has created in his mind and has smashed it all into one book. It is the greatest book ever written and the greatest that will ever be written. Everyone should read it.
3,History Book,"I'm gonna have to say that Iiked LoTR a lot better. This is mainly just history of Middle-Earth. People sa it's the Bible of Middle-Earth, but I wouldn't strongly agree with that. This is written completely in the third person, and some of the Bible is first person. Lus the Bible is history, but has a good way of making stories sound interesting. I wasn't too wild with this, unless you need to refer to history because LoTR is too confusing or if you're really bored. I'd try some of his other books first."
4,Excellent book to read to help with background on Lord of the Rings,"This book takes some work to get through. However, it really gives you the back story on the Lord of the Rings. I would recommend it to anyone interested in enhancing their enjoyment of the Lord of the Rings series."
5,One of the best books I've read!!!!!!!,"I was lead to this book after reading LoTR three times!! If you like this, then read the Hobbit, and The Lord of The Rings."
2,Calling all Tolkien Freaks,"Much has been said about the dryness of this book, and it is true; it reads like a cross between a text book and the King James Version of The Bible.With that said, if you loved the Hobbit, the Ring Trilogy and have a particular fondness for elves, you MUST at least skim this book. Even though this is not a page-turner, or a book you will read cover-to-cover, you will probably enjoy getting Tolkien's thoughts (which drive the stories in the above-mentioned books) about the beginnings of Middle-Earth.It's also very handy as a reference book and the pronounciation guide and glossary in the back of it are invaluable. :o)"
2,GOOOOSCH ...!!!!! REALLY HARD READING !!!!,"Tolkien is the master of fantasy. No doubt about it. So, I supose what I'll say below will leave many of his fans upset. The truth is the following: this book is boring. The concept is grandious, the creation of Arda magnific, the battle between the elves and Melkor amazing. But Tolkien's style is typical of some British writers. It is dry. Even when he writes about beautiful moments or beautiful scenarios, it's dry and emotionless, almost if it was just a newsman relating it. So, enduring reading the whole book is already a victory. Please pay attention to the fact that I'm not saying this is not a great book. This would be insane. I'm just saying the writing style is boring."
2,Scholarly Writing on Middle Earth,"Tolkein never intended for this book to go to print. He used it as background information to lend body to his masterpieces: The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings Trilogy. While the Silmarillian may provide information to the die-hard Tolkein fan, don't expect it to evoke the same magic Tolkein's other works weave so adeptly. It contains neither the personal element of seeing Middle Earth through the eyes of the human-like hobbits, nor the redemption of a single coherent plot. This book reads like a history text, which is, in fact, what it was conceived to be."
2,very boring,"If you've read the hobbit and the lord of the rings triology, don't expect this book to be like those. It reads more like a history book than a fantasy novel. If you've ever studied medieval english history, and had to memorize the names of kings, when they ruled, who was related to who, who married so and so, and who their brother's were, then you have a pretty good idea what this book is like. Unless you're the tolkien equivalent of a die-hard trekkie, I would not recommend reading this book. Quite boring."
2,Immensely difficult to read,"Am I the only one who doesn't think this book is the best one ever written? It's not the stories, anyone interested enough in the world of Tolkien will want to know what actually happened in the first and second era, but the style of writing is impossible! I have managed, purely out of my enormous interest in Middle Earth and its inhabitants, to wrestle myself through this book once; the second time I tried I couldn't even reach page 10.This book is clearly a collection of notes which Tolkien made about his world's history, which have never been rewritten in a pleasantly readable style, and which have never been checked to keep things consistent, as there are many given facts that differ from given facts in other parts of the book.In short: only read this book if you are really, really interested in the history of Middle Earth, otherwise it's impossible to get through."
2,Not what I expected..Listen to it on unabridged CD,"This is NOT a continuation of the LOTR/Hobbit story. I rated it only 2 stars not for any fault in the book, but rather the fact that this is really a reference book and not a story. I suppose that if you wish to ferret out specific details and ""historical"" content it would be fine. But I found it a little too dry and disjointed to read with enjoyment.The above review was written in may 2002. This addition to my review was written on 18 Sept 2006.I still find the Silmarillion hard to read. I did listen to it on an unabridged CD and liked it. Part of the problem is that the Silmarillion is disjointed and the place names are hard to keep straight. The audio version obviates that. Please don't think that I am down on printed books. Lord knows there isn't a low priced, durable, simple to use/store electronic device that can hold a candle to a book. But for the Silmarillion, I'd make an exception."
5,Better than either of the others.,"This is an exeptional book that no one else has ever, could ever, attempt. It is better than TLOTR, mainly from the absence of Hobbits. Mind! I like the little fellows, but they are so much like real people that it hinders the true spirit of the elves from coming through. In the SILMARILLION there are no Hobbits, and the true magic of Middle-earth shines through. On the whole, I like the books in this order: The Silmarillion The Two TowersThe Return Of The King The Fellowship of the Ring The Hobbit (Don't get me wrong-- it far surpasses most books, but Tolkein was that rare thing-a genius)"
5,Wow,Tolkien is a genius and this is his magnum opus. LotR was the greatest fantasy series ever and this book (which he never meant to publish) is the reason why. The ammount of thought that he put into the background and history of middle earth is astounding. It will never be matched.
4,A great addition to fantasy,This book is very good and if you enjoyed Tolkien's previous books though this is more depressing and much more romanticand the storytelling is much more detached though overall it is a great book
5,Gorgeous Production!!,The story itself is haunting; the illustrations do more to invoke the readers' imagination than deaden it..
4,Very good,"If you enjoy the LOTR trilogy, as well as The Hobbit, this is a can't miss novel. From everything to the history of the elves and men, to the story of Sauron's master, this book has everything you need to complete your knowledge of Tolkien's universe. Enjoy!"
2,The Silmarillion Christopher Tolkien,"I find this book very difficult to read. really hard to read a book *on my kindle* that has question marks in place of letters in names, places, ext. making it hard to figure out that the writer is writing about."
3,For the determined reader,"While not as gripping as Tolkien's other works, it is definitely worth reading for a deeper, richer history of Middle-Earth. It can be difficult to keep track of the lineages at times. Not for the casual reader, but interesting nonetheless."
5,Amazing,Did not disappoint. All Lord of the Rings fans should read this tale. Everything is explained and elaborated on to the point if all questions answered.
4,A must have for diehard Middle-Earth fans,If The Hobbit in 3D is your major link with Middle Earth - the imaginary world so stunningly created by J.R.R. Tolkien - the Silmarillion is probably not your cup of tea.But when the Lord of the Rings trilogy and the Hobbit have drawn your interest in how Tolkien masterfully invented this world you can't do without The Silmarillion. Don't expect though to read it as a novel or even an epos like the Lord of the Rings. Sometime it's dry stuff. But if you have the endurence to digest The Silmarillion you get a wonderful insight in the consistency and the beauty of the word Tolkien made up so craftedly.
3,for Elve freaks,"As profoundly beautiful as the creation of the world through the eyes of Tolkien really is, this book is for those who *have* to know *more* about Tolkien's elves, or for those who have a passionate love (and attention span) for myths and ancient legends.Where as the Hobbit was a children's story compared to the breath and scope of the Lord of the Rings, the Silmarillion is another step up in the complexity ladder of Tolkien's fictional history books. Interweaving characters and situations together, creating a complicated tapestry of Middle Earth, pre-War of the Rings, this is not light reading - but it's just as fanciful and enjoyable as Tolkien's other Middle Earth works. Brave it only *after* you've read the Lord of the Rings, if you so desire to know more about the origins of many characters and places such as Galadriel, Elrond, and Rivendell.Sorry, the Sil *still* doesn't explain that whacked out Tom Bombadill character though!"
5,One of the greatest stories ever written,"I'm 31 now and I think I first read LotR when I was 12. It's an amazing story I've read at least 10 times. The Silmarillion gives meaning and depth to the The Hobbit and LotR. It provides the historical background for the events at the end of the Third Age, and in itself is a fantastic cycle of tales. While some would say it's ""dry"" or ""boring"", I would disagree. I believe the tone of the book is intended to convey a written (or oral) history, written at a much later date than the events depicted in the text (possibly ""Translations from the Elvish"" as written by Bilbo Baggins in Rivendell) and as such is (for the most part) written in the third person, without much dialog but with plenty of action. The creation of the Silmarils by Feanor, their theft by Melkor, and the trajedy of the Oath of the Noldor is epic fantasy at its peak, and has yet to be surpassed by any other author."
3,Meh...,"To enjoy this book you need to REALLY want to know more of the history of middle-earth. Superbly written, and vivid description, but there is too much to take in in 300 pages. At times it is boring, at others exciting, but quite interesting all the way through. Reommended if you want to learn more about Tolkien's world, but otherwise, I think you should stay away from this one."
3,The 'et al' is important,"This book is a compilation of JRR's notes, with some fleshing out done by his son Christopher. If you want to understand the history and mythology of LotR, you should read this. But don't expect the same consistency of quality. Some of the chapters are superb, others are truly boring. Also, since this is a collection of notes made over a long period of time, don't expect it to be entirely consistent with itself or with LotR. Then again, neither is the Bible."
4,What a story,"Was very detailed. I enjoyed the depth and back story, but certain parts were a little slow when it was talking about who was born to who and so on."
5,Tolkien's Mythology Explained!,"I read the Hobbit as a child, and the LOTR as an adult, but never got around to tackling the Silmarillion. I say ""tackle"" because Tolkien's prose or writing style was a little difficult for me to follow. Eventually however, I got into the rhythm and adored all the richness of the entire evolution of his middle earth universe. Interestingly enough, now I am re-reading LOTR with a renewed perspective and understanding of the arcane references to middle-earth history throughout the tales. Also, since the volumes have been edited and rereleased, I think I shall go back and read the latest edition of The Hobbit.I highly recommend ""tackling"" this important volume!"
2,I love tolkien,"When I read the Hobbit as a boy I had to reread it again and again I even tried to read it to other people and to this day I am urging my children and nieces and nephews and any friends who havent read it to open up the covers and let the magic out. BUT... I can't recommend the Silmarillion, I hve tried to read it many times and rarely do I get past page 200. It reads like the Bible. I am not saying the Bible is a bad thing but it is not an exciting and dynamic read. A fictional Novel should be. It should involve dialogue rather than a recounting of actions of one person or deity and then jump days, years, or centuries ahead to recount others. I love tolkien but I think I will stick to the Lord of The Rings"
5,Must Read For All LOTR Fans!,"Ok this book is different than the Hobbit and LOTR as much as apples are to chopped liver in the way they are wriiten. Very heady and lots of information. Although a tougher read especially in the beginning, the book starts making more and more ""sense"" to LOTR lovers. Lots of great lore, battles, you name it! If you are a Middle-Earth buff you will much enjoy this book. Lot's of names, family trees and geogrpahy make it a bit hard on the brain for casual readers but the more important ones stay with you throughout the book. Exciting tales await the reader of this book if you are willing to tough out the more brain-draining parts of the book."
2,Who needs another Bible,"It took me 10 years to read this book. I'd started with the Hobbit when I was in my early teens and enjoyed it, then read Lord of the Rings Trilogy. I picked up the Silmarillion at a yard sale, not even knowing of it's existance and started to read. I didn't get through 2 chapters. I've read the Bible cover to cover twice and I couldn't get through this book. It took me 10 years to finally read it cover to cover and I couldn't tell you what happens beyond a basic description. It even has pages and pages of begats, just like Genesis. The only reason I even finished it is I set a stupid goal for myself. The book takes you through generation after generation, and gives you the origins of countless Tolkien species. In General, Not that interesting and I wish I hadn't bothered"
3,formatting,"Great book. You cannot enlarge the type, paragraphs are dropped. Must keep smallest type to read totality.Oh well, guess the glasses are on."
3,"Epic, almost Biblical, which isn't entirely a good thing","Tolkien criticized his friend C. S. Lewis's fictional writings for being overly allegorical, but his own work is pretty darn allegorical, too. The Silmarillion opens with a religious creation story clearly based mainly on the Judeo-Christian version, though with elements of Greek and Scandinavian mythology mixed in (which somewhat improves it). He even adopts a quasi-biblical/mythological style. This makes it much harder to get through than The Lord of the Rings, but it has some nice moments, and its epic scale is pretty much unmatched."
3,Good but not overwhelming...,"Great book, but no overwhelmingly good as everybody says. LORD OF THE RINGS is much better. This Silmarillion seems like the first book of LOFR, ""Fellowship of the Ring"", which is the worst and slowest of the three books."
3,unfinished,"Few authors have succeeded in developing and describing in loving detail realms not of this world as well as J.R.R. Tolkien. But the SIMARILLION outlines only the bare bones of the story and is in no way comparable to the LORD OF THE RINGS or even THE HOBBIT as far as the treatment of the environs, the dialog and mood is concerned. What remains is an involved plot in the best of mythological traditions, that recently saw a revival.The Woman and The Raven"
1,Silmarillion is disappointing at best.,"A one star rating is too high for this travesty. I do not believe Tolkien actually wrote it. He is too great an author to have written such disjointed and meaningless drivel. When a book runs 377 pages and then has to have nearly 100 pages to explain what was said is unacceptable. There are 73 pages of names and explanations of those name. The book is hard to read (and I do have an Masters degree in education) for most people just because of the excessive names and places to be remembered and connected.If you like Tolkien, stay away from this discouraging example of prose. Read his other very fine books instead -- The Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings trilogy."
1,A waste of time,This work of Tolkien's pales in comparison with The Hobbit. It is a collage of stories not related to one another and does not portray elves that is consistent with the TLOR.
4,Good buy,"Got this for my dad for Christmas. It came 3 days sooner than stated. It was in great shape, but not perfect. Corners/edges were a little damaged, but nothing more than handling from a good 1 or 2 reads."
5,Best Book I Have Ever Read!!!,this is the best book i have ever read besides the lotr of course. it is so neat to know what happened before the war of the ring.
5,"Wonderful, awe-inspiring work","If you're a true Tolkien fan, this is definetly a book you should read!To find out about the Valar, how Middle Earth came to be, why Melkor became Morgoth, the story of Luthien, I can keep going, but there are many other amazing stories in this book.The one thing is, it's a little harder to read for some as it's a blend of stories, not one big one like Lord of the Rings, and not a light as The Hobbit. But I still believe that people, besides Tolkien fans, should read this book."
5,"First Review, be gentle.","I'm a long time Tolkien fan, and yes that means before the movies came out. If you are reading the Simarillion, then you are most likely a Tolkien fan as well. I'm personally always captivated by the amount of detail Tolkien goes into. We all know that he is wordy, (or better we should call it abundantly descriptive), but that is part of the joy of this book and the rest of Tolkien's works. The Simarillion will give you your first glimpse into the ancestry of the people of Middle Earth. You begin to learn the histories, the tales, the languages, the dialects, the joys, the losses of all the races. some of the questions you had from the Trilogy, will be answered. Just like the rest of his books, it's a wonderful ride and I hope you truly enjoy it as much as I did."
5,An excellent rendition,"Martin Shaw is wonderful in this audio version of The Silmarillion. He has a rich voice, and does an excellent job performing the different characters, and changing his tone when warranted. He clearly researched The Silmarillion before performing it; the pronunciations are correct, and the gravity of the book is maintained. If you've never read The Silmarillion, this is a good way to start, and if you're a fan, you should enjoy this version."
5,Stirringly beautiful,"The beauty of Tolkien's world, especially that of his elves, surpasses anything I've encountered in fiction. I was surprised to enjoy this more than I did The Lord of the Rings. The lives of Tolkien's elves will leave you breathless. This is, in my mind, the definitive ""fantasy"" book. LOTR succeeds brilliantly in building the world of men on top of this foundation, but if you want your fantasy pure, this is the ultimate."
4,"Tough read, but worth the time.","Tolkien spent a good portion of his life writing the stories that went into this book, and the level of detail in them is apparent. A warning to anyone who thinks that this book will be along the lines of The Hobbit or The Lord of the Rings books - BEWARE. This is a collection of stories compiled by Tolkien's son, and there is no smooth progression through the book. Each ""Chapter"" is its own story, start to finish. Also, unless you have a photographic memory, the number of names given in each story is mind blowing. Many of the characters have 2 or 3 names each, depending on the language of the land, and some decide to change their own names halfway through the event being described. A worthwhile read for the backstory to LOTR, but a time consuming book to wade through."
5,"A Wonderful book, but....","THE SILMARILLION is a wonderful book and provides a rich legacy of information which underlies Tolkien's beloved THE HOBBIT and THE LORD OF THE RINGS (LOTR). The author shows the true depth and richness of Middle Earth, creating a beautiful mixture of myth, folklore, and in some respects, scripture.For those who have loved and cherished Tolkien's more famous works, this book will provide great enjoyment. HOWEVER, for the person not familiar with LOTR, the book may be extremely difficult. While beautifully crafted, it may be difficult to follow as it is more reference than story in a sense.I would, as have many others, recommend THE HOBBIT first, followed by LOTR, both masterpieces of storytelling. With sufficient interest and background, THE SILMARILLION can then be truly appreciated for its own great gifts."
4,Good but complicated,"I love Tolkien and have read most works about middle earth. The amount of knowledge, names, and places is without a doubt vast but in this book it can be a little overwhelming in the beginning"
2,Details: You may like them or hate them,"I read the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, The Hobbit, and some of Tolkien's shorter works. When The Silmarillion came out, I was in a completist mood, got it and read it. Part of the way through, I decided that ""I really don't want to know anything more about all this."" I did force myself to finish it, with most details going in one eye and out the other.A lot of details that obviously fascinate some people and bore others. Having recently entered senior citizenship, I will content myself with the goal of re-reading the Trilogy and The Hobbit. This is a goal I have had for the past 39 years, since I first read it in the summer of 1966."
4,Listen before you read!,"I tried several times to read The Silmarillion, but usually became bogged down with the names and lost in the various places. However, after listening to Martin Shaw's wonderful melodic voice, the story seemed to fall into place. Hearing the names aloud makes them all the more real, and for any lover of LOTR I highly recommend hearing this tale at some point (but especially for those who've tried to read it and found it wanting!).It's also a great way to get a clearer picture of the fantastic history of Middle Earth ."
5,GET,"It's Tolkien! Of course you want to get it! This is my first time reading it, and I'm only through the first part, and I'm planning to get his Histories of Middle Earth eventually."
3,Difficult Read,The initial portion of the book is tough to get through. The second half is very good and gives a better insight as to the world of Middle -Earth. A must read for die-hard fans.
3,Not for everyone.,"I think there is a tendency in the world of Tolkien-worship whereby hardcore fans will always say Silmarillion is better than LotR. I think this is due to the fact that only a hardcore fan can actually walk away from this book and say that its a good piece of literature. Most casual readers never get past page 50. It's a set of myths. It is not a novel. The story is pretty boring. The characters are flat, largely uninteresting, cardboard cut-out typed people. Of course, that's sort of the way it happens in myth/legend. As a made up history for a fantasy world, it does its job about as well as it can, but that does not make this an enjoyable read or a good piece of literature."
5,Provides valuable background to LOTR,"The Silmarillion consists of a history of Middle Earth from the creation through most of the period before the Lord of the Rings stories take place. It is written as a history, not as a modern novel (unlike Lord of the Rings); and so do not read it expecting a novel. However, if you are very addicted to the Lord of the Rings saga and plan to read it again, the Silmarillion will definitely provide a lot of key historic information that will enhance your enjoyment of the Lord of the Rings. It will help you understand the origins of the races and many of the names and places mentioned in the songs and tales which may have seemed rather obscure the first time around. Think ""historic background"" and not ""exciting prequel"" and you will not be disappointed."
5,Cool book,"The Silmarillion is, well, Elvish (duh)- it is ""the epic history of the Elves in middle earth"". However, if you are loyal to Legolas only, this book is probably not for you, being as he isn't in here. Galadriel is, and Earendil is, as are Turin, Tuor, Elros and Elrond. Frodo is mentioned on the second-to-last page of the story *grins* , and Sam is indirectly mentioned *cracks knuckles*, but other than that, no hobbits (drat). Includes a rather incomplete Elvish dictionary at the end."
5,Great,"This is much more challenging than the Hobbit! It's a vast, dense history in the fantasy genre. Sort of like a fantasy version of the book of Chronicals. If you can get through this and still like it, I think it is safe to say that Tolkien is your cup of tea."
1,Boring?,"I loved LotR, and I loved Hobbit, and I bought this book, expecting another great story (or collection of stories, whatever). Instead, I find myself with 366 pages of condensed boredom. I dunno, perhaps I'm missing something here, but while I find it fascinating, I just can't see how anyone can *enjoy* it...Nevertheless, if you liked the other two books, don't let my comment put you off buying it, you might be one of the people who does find it enjoyable."
1,Lord of the Rings stands without this volume.,"These stories were written as the history of Middle Earth, and are fascinating in LotR precisely because they are never told completely, like the books described by Borges that never existed. Be content with LotR-- a 20th century masterpiece! Let these tales remain mysterious creatures of the woods, rather than jarred specimens in a biology room... by not reading them."
1,waste of time,"This is supposed too be one of his greatest works but it is probably the lowest point he has ever reached.If you have read anything in the bible you now it isn't even Tolkien who made the charakters, he has just changed the names.Sorry to say but this should have been much, much better"
1,"Dull, dull, dull treatise on Middle Earth","I love Tolkein's books, but as a reader, not a student. Therefore, I look at his books as a reader of STORIES, not an intellectual exercise in world building. Therefore, I have to say, ""The Silmarillion"" is a boring textbook exercise on documenting the bloodlines that Tolkein wrote about so brilliantly in the Hobbit and Trilogy books.The writing style is documentarian, tinder-box dry and dull. There's not an ounce of emotion in the entire volume. It's more like a thesauraus than a novel.If you want an engrossing story for adults, read ""LOTR."" If you are looking for a more childlike adventure, pick up ""The Hobbit."" But don't buy ""The Silmarillion"" unless you'd get excited by looking through a Farmer's Almanac/World Book encyclopedia of Middle Earth."
5,"Tolkien's ""The Silmarillion""","This book is the greatest of all Tolkien's works I believe. It is an epic novel that deals with the very shaping of Middle-Earth and life itself. The book begins with the song of anuir and the shaping of the world and Illuvatar's Children (Elves {The Noldor}, and Men {The Edain}). It shows how Melkor became lustful and greedy and fell from his place of high honour.And how he then desired to rule all. And all the while when this was talking place at one point an elf was born, he was named Feanor. And he was the greatest smithy, and the most powerful elf of all time. He created the silmarils. And Melkor (later named Morgoth by Feanor after ""The Rape Of The Silmarils"") It talks of the elves exile from valinor and their war with Melkor.This Book I believe is a wonderful book and all people who enjoy this type of mythologic book should read it. I feel though that this book should be read prior to the other works of J.R.R. Tolkien because it gives an history of Middle-Earth."
5,Simply splendid,"The Silmarillion is the back story of the epic Lord of the Rings. Tolkien decribes the sundering of Valinor and the epic battles of the First Age from which come the stories and legends of the Third Age. It is not the easiest read, but well worth the effort."
4,"Rough, But Worth It","It's easy to see why Tolkien wanted this appended as a prologue to Lord of the Rings and it's equally easy to see why the publisher rejected that idea. If you're a fan of Tolkien's world-building, then this is worthwhile, but it's a slog. The language is very lofty, the litany of names is challenging, and the prose is... turgid.But if you can make it though the muck, you'll find a rich and tragic story about a world that starts in a state of beauty and perfection and slowly slides into despair and destruction. It gives context to the world of Lord of the Rings and enriches some of the themes of sacrifice that run through Tolkien's works."
5,J.R.R Tolkien's Silmarillion,"I would definitely say this book is a must have companion to the Lord of the Rings series if your a big fan of the books. As previous reviews have stated, the beginning is a bit hard to get through, but once your past it, its really a good story. A friend of mine once said it read like a text book. He was partially correct. It is very text booky towards the beginning, but it really is handy for deciphering all the background legends in lord of the rings."
5,A jewel of a book,"I first read this book in sixth grade. Then, all it did was confuse me. When I had re-read it enough to understand it, I feel in love with it. Tolkien writes so well, I would recommend this book to anyone. The imaginativeness in the book is well-worth the read itself. While I love this book, it is not for one who does not like skipping from story-to-story or the ""olden"" type of english. The only thing that I don't like about the book is the many names of some of the characters, when there's at least a hundred. (most likely more)."
5,The Silmarillion,"This book, while rather confusing (especially with all the names sounding alike, ie: Manwe, Ingwe, Elwe, Olwe, Finwe, Aule), is a very good look at the history of Middle-Earth. It helps you find out who the people are when they are referred to in LOTR, such as Earendil and Varda. However, as my friend puts it, it is the Bible of Middle-Earth. I like it, but then again, I'm odd."
4,Great background.,"If you've wondered about all those ""historical"" references in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, you'll like this book. As with LOTR, the prose is sometimes tedious and the scores of names (as many as five per character) bewildering, but the book's editor -- Tolkien's son, Christopher -- does his best to keep it moving with maps, geneaological charts, pronunciation guides, etc."
3,the title says it,"a bit hard to read, but the background of its creation was told; they are unfinished tales. however, it's a wider view to the history of LoR and others."
4,A must have,"If you enjoy the Silmarillion, then you are a special type of Tolkien fan. I must say that, if you are that special Tolkien follower, you will have a strong idea for yourself of how things are pronounced, how voices sound, etc. The Silm. audio book and it's narrator will probably jar you slightly from your expectations, but in the end I believe you will enjoy the piece, and consider it an important addition to your Tolkien library."
4,The history of Middle Earth,"This book fleshes out some of the characters in the Lord of the Rings. Especially the Elves. It can be kind of heavy (this is Tolkien, after all), but a good read if you wanted to know how Sauron rose to power, why Dwarves don't like Elves or what the Undying Lands are.I found it to be more like a history book than a novel. It really helps the world of Middle Earth feel more real. Almost as if you could get on a boat and travel there for your next vacation.I liked it, but it took a while to read it because I had to take breaks from it."
1,Silmarillion: 5 stars! This recording: ZERO stars...,"I love each and every word of ""The Silmarillion""; no Tolkien education is complete without it and no reading of ""The Lord of the Rings"" is possibly as rich without it (those who think otherwise delude themselves). BUT--this Martin Shaw presentation is DREADFUL: so lifeless, so passionless. The mispronunciations (accepting JRR's own readings as canon) are galling! Now: for a beautiful, emotional, *emotive* reading--do try Christopher Tolkien's own readings. His ""Of Beren and Lúthien"" is simply not to be missed."
2,Silmarillion= least favorite of the works of Tolkien,"This is definatly not what i expected. the first 100 pages are a grueling history of the gods of middle earth and it took me a commited effort to read through them. There were several times i thought the phone book would be a more interesting reading. after that it lightens up a little bit but i still had flash backs of sitting in church as a child being forced to listen to the preacher without falling asleep. I am dedicated to finishing the book, like it or not. In my opinion, this is not the Tolkien we all now and love. this is something totally different. It's not the same style or interesting story as the hobit or LOTR. I would only recommend this to the most serious and dedicated Tolkien fans or nerdy types that enjoy a difficult and long winded geneology of ficticous days of old."
5,The most awe inspiring book I have ever read!,"I think what makes the book so incredible, is that it is not a story or one person, or several people. Rather it is the story of a peoples. It is a whole world essentially created by Tolkien. It is a very difficult book to read, and I had to read it almost three times before I knew who everybody was and how they were related to the other guy. It is a world that is so like our own that we can see the similarities, yet on the other side it is so unlike our own world that it gives it a mysterious air. I would recommend this book to anybody that has any interest in the works of Tolkien. I have tried to convince friends to read it, but it is so complex that some people don't like to put that much effort into their reading, so they get put off by it's complexity."
2,This book is a disapointment,"I loved the Hobit, but the Silmarillion was very dificult to read. It was boring with too many names to remember."
1,Silmarillion,I think the book is boring!!!!I was frustrated with do many differentnames of characters. The only good part of the book was the last section because there was a connection to theHobbit.
1,"Dull, dull, dull.","What is everyone so excited about? I can't figure out what Tolkien was thinking when he wrote this. I loved his other works, but this was difficult to get through. It's reminiscent of the bible, like alot of other people have mentioned, lots of things getting created, and hundreds of names, lists of elves begetting other elves. If you like plot, look elsewhere."
2,it would've been better fully writen by tolkien,"as it says at the top, christopher tolkien compiled the book through his fathers notes, and i loved the plot and ideas... but i found it read to muc like a text book and seemed to drone on through ages without dialog or anything..."
1,Increadibly hard to read,"this book was written like a text book, it has no plot and no character development it just tells the entire history of middle earth. the story spans several ages so you read about many different generations of families. the bad part about this is that for whatever reason all of the male characters have almost the same name thus making it not only boring to read but difficult to understand. Its like reading a history book about that time period in Prussia where every who ruled was named Frederick except your reading it for fun and not a class grade."
5,A Great Read!,"The Silmarillion, in my view, is one of Tolkiens greatest books. It is not because of a great plot,as the book is only loosely linked together. Rather its greatness comes from the view that it presents of the earliest times of Middle Earth, and how it sets the stage for the Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings. Before the Elves learned wisdom, they were arrogant; before they learned self-control, they were over-zealous, anxious to prove what they could do. The crucible of the events of the First and Second Ages tried them and tested them, making them wise beyond any others, having learned wisdom from sorrow. Also, the story of Beren and Luthien, like a gleaming jewel set in a dark setting, stands as one of the greatest love stories I have ever encountered. Tolkien is a master wordsmith and he makes you feel his world. In my view, the Silmarillion provides the essential understanding and background for the LOTR."
5,Silmarillion,I used this book for a college class and it served me well. I got it in great shape for a good price too!
4,the silmarillion ON CD!,"i absolutely love the book, so i figured why not try the audiobook for my holidays. Martin Shaw reads the book brilliantly. And it really helps you focus on the imagination of the book because he does the hardwork for you.I would strongly recommend knowing the book before listening to this collection though, as if you don't know the names and maps etc, you just wont keep up with martin (not that he's too fast, but rather Tolkien constantly creates new characters and locations chapter after chapter).The only downside to the CD collection is that it is in a great box, but has 13 normal-sized CD cases in there, each with no sleeve.It would be better if either the cases had sleeves or they came in slimmer cases or sleeves, thus reducing the size of the box.all in all. a great buy"
3,filled in the blanks of my curiosity of Hobbit/Lord of Rings,"I used to wonder who this Elbereth/Githoniel person was and why only the high elves spoke of her. I used to wonder who Shelob really was and where she came from. But after reading the Silmarilion, all my questions about the Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings were answered."
3,"A good book, but no Lord of the Rings","Don't treat the Silmarillion as a novel; treat it as a history book.It is rather dry in places and definitely does not have any of the characterization, description, or adventure of the Lord of the Rings. It took me several months to read, considering that I read both The Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings in a week, shows that it's really slow. However, I think this is a worthwhile read for anyone really interested in Middle-earth, if only to get the background history to LOTR. It's fascinating and quite informative, but don't attempt unless you really, really want to know the info in it. Or like Elves. There are WAY too many Elves. I have to say I kept wishing a couple of hobbits would turn up to make it interesting..."
5,Breathtakingly Beautiful,"The Lord of the Rings was so wonderful. The Silmarillion has a completely different kind of beauty. It reads more like an old tale of history (like Herodotus without all of the digressions), and it is steeped in the unique magic of Middle-earth. If you ever feel a longing for days that will never return, The Silmarillion is for you. It satisfies that feeling for a while, yet it sharpens the longing all the more."
2,GREAT BOOK -- terrible mass-market edition.,"This is not a literary review. This review is about the MASS-MARKET PAPERBACK printing/edition.I have the version with a gray/silver cover... WASTE OF MONEY. This is a wonderful companion for the Lord of the Rings, but this printing is terrible. It's tiny, stiff, and cheap. The paper is yellowish with tiny, poorly printed font.If you love LOTR and Tolkien, then buy this book -- just DON'T buy the mass-market paperback, keep looking for a better version."
5,Tolkien reveals his genius,"In short, this book showcases the mastermind that Tolkien is. Here he reveals the creation of his world, with almost every detail intact, from the mountains to the seas to the sun and moon. It is fascinating to discover the origin of many characters or legends found in The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. It is true that this book does read somewhat like a history book and it does take some more effort to get through at times because of the huge amount of characters that are presented to the reader, but for any die-hard Tolkien fan this is essential reading that you will thoroughly enjoy. Also, the index and pronunciation guide are very helpful.As for this edition, it is a solid book good for many readings. Those who want something more may want to go for the newest edition illustrated by Ted Nasmith, with a fold-out color map and color illustrations."
5,My favorite of Tolkien's work.,"This book isn't for the novice fantasy reader and it comes with some baggage. However, it is the Genesis equivalent of the story line. Fingolfin's rise and fall is fascinating. The creation of the elves, the calling of the Istar (wizards), man, dwarves, the Valar most all the beings of what becomes Middle Earth (except perhaps the Hobbits) all in one. I really enjoyed this book even if it was unfinished. So many questions were answered reading this book."
4,OVER 999 PAGES!?!,"Yeah I know. It is A REAAAAALLLLYYYYY long book. I did the math using the percentage on my kindle. This book is anywhere from 1200 to 1300 pages long. Luckily, if you know what you are looking for, you can easily just skip to that section. It is like the Bible, you read the parts that you are required or want to, and can easily understand them without reading the entire book."
3,"The version, not the book itself...","I'm not so much rating the book itself, which I enjoyed more on a ""4 1/2 star"" level, but this ""e-version"" of the book through the Kindle application on an iPad. Reading it wasn't difficult, but there were occasional problems with things like spelling, links to footnotes and the general layout. Since I had never read this book and had the application, I decided to give this and another book by Tolkien a try through the Kindle app, but I think I'd have rather added hardcover editions of the books to add to my small library. I think I might choose to save Kindle editions for books I am quite certain that I won't care to keep at all, because the errors in this edition were slightly annoying. It is quite possible that an actual Kindle may not have had the same problems, but I cannot test that out as I only have applications for iOS and Android."
4,Beautifully Written,I truly awe inspiring creation story. Tolkien left nothing on the table creating this story. Every last detail ties to everything he has written in some way or another. Fun to read the story of Sauron and how all of the species came about. Worth the read if you enjoyed the Lord of the Rings series or the Hobbit. It is a bit a difficult read though so be prepared.
5,Fantastic,Great read for anyone even slightly interested in Middle-Earths lore and history. Is right up there with Tolkien's best writing.
4,"A good, not entirely old-fashioned approach to German","Margarita Madrigal has written or co-written a number of introductory language books, all premised on the idea that with some basic structures, good vocabulary associations and a dash of entertainment, you can learn a language. Invitation to German is not the most entertaining, the most challenging, or the most innovative introduction to German ever written. But it introduces some basic sentence patterns and vocabulary fairly painlessly. This is not the only book you'll ever need to learn German - no book is - but if you've learned a little conversational German and want a broader vocabulary and better understanding of basic sentence structures, it's well worth it at its very reasonable cost."
5,I love this soap!,"This soap is nothing short of a miracle! I have suffered with acne since my early teens (I am now 29) and nothing would clear it up. I have had both over the counter and prescription medications, even expensive laser treatements. I tried this soap after reading all the positive reviews and after only a week my skin has improved dramatically. I have no new blemishes and no more blackheads! If you've tried everything with no luck, try this soap."
5,Great Soap,"super product. Used it twice a day in the beginning to see super results in like three days. I wash my face nothing less than three times a day , but you can and will over dry if you use it that much . After you get the clarity you want then only use it every other day."
3,Works for acne not tinea versicolor,"Worked for my bad back acne, but it left a horrid smell percolating on my back. the stench remained on me all day long. Beware if you are using this soap and will be in public"
3,Worked but didn't last long,"The soap formulation itself works well, like several other 3-5% sulfur soaps I tried over the course of several months. It has a 3% sulfur concentration so it's on the milder end. The sulfur smell isn't too bad--you'll smell it, but it isn't as overpowering as some topical sulfur creams. However, the bar itself has a wide and thin shape, which meant that it wore down to a sliver more quickly than the other bars I tried. Consequently, I'd recommend a more compact-shaped 3% sulfur bar or, if your skin can tolerate 5% sulfur, the Derma Klear bar."
3,No clear results,"I bought this because I read that sulfur would help break up keratin (I have keratosis pilaris on my upper arms). After daily use for about 3 weeks I have yet to notice any difference. It may be that it takes longer, but most of the people here that said that they noticed a difference noticed it by this point. It also hasn't done anything for the various other pimples I have.It's not terrible, but for me, it doesn't do anything that a $0.50 bar of soap already does. I'll be looking for a keratosis treatment elsewhere."
1,Not impressed,"I'm not impressed with this soap at all. Doesn't remove make up, leaves skin dry and clogged. Didn't notice any difference in acne improvement either."
3,Not for me but may work for you,This product worked well for about a week. Grandpa's Pine Tar Soap works well for me. The product is great for other types of skin. But I have extremely sensitive oily skin that will freak out if I put anything with exfoliants on my skin. I guess this is too much for me. But with other types of skin it would probably great. Sorry I couldn't be of more help.
4,Better than expected,The soap worked better than I exected it to. My acne has been reduced by atleast 75%. Other reviews and my doctor warned me of how drying the soap was but I didn't find it to be too bad. I used a non-acne facial moisturizer after each wash and have been fine. The only complaint I have about the soap is the smell. I wish it had a nicer scent. When first taken out of the package it smells fine but once wet you can really smell the sulfur. I don't care for the smell of sulfur. I would recommend this product to friends and have.
1,BORING VIDEO!!!!,"This video was a waste of my time after I saw it because I was thinking of doing it with a dolphin but now, after I watched this movie, I don't want to!!!! This movie was a definite waste of my time!! I should have rented something else!!! Also the boto was a screwed up dolphin-man because he had a blowhole on his head and he ate fish by biting them instead of cooking and fileting them!!! I hated this movie!!! FOLKS, THIS MOVIE WAS A WASTE OF MY TIME AND IT MIGHT BE A WASTE OF YOURS!!!!!!"
5,One of the best books ever read,"It is beautiful and inspiring. I can read the first few pages again whenever I feel down, and feel better. It was recommended to me by my favorite Benedictine abbess."
1,One man's perspective,Was too inside the box of parochical standards for my Christian beliefs. I'm glad we can agree to disagree. YEA America.
5,Introspection for any woman,"Simply loved Heartbeats in the Wind: Reflections of an Arab Woman. Not only does Randa's writing serve as a unifier of women but of people in general as emotions, heartbreak, growth and development are something we all can relate to. I found Randa's new website and suggest that you set aside some personal time to visit the site. We learn more about who Randa Hamwi is and have the opportunity to read more of her poetry and stories at her beautiful designed website - http://www.randahamwi.com."
1,"great pictures 5 star, -dangerous info - 1 star","Again, Sherrill has produced a book worth examining for wonderful pictures, and step-by-step techniques. My greatest concern is once again finding the trademarked material TYVEK utilized in craft work. The makers of TYVEK specifically have stated it is never to be heated or used other than for what it is specifically designed for. Deathly toxic, once more it is appalling to find it used with a 'heat outdoors' statement attached. Does the company know this material is being used this way??? As an art educator I must not only be aware of this safety info for myself but for my students. Poor editing let this one slip by."
5,Great Spot Remover,"The product does an excellent job at spot cleaning rugs. It makes red wine and coffee stains disappear after a short length of time, often without even touching the stain. The fresher the stain the better it works. It also does an excellent job on other type stains. I use it to pretreat a dirty rug before steam-vaccing. Make sure bottle says ""Thriple Action"" as this is the improved version that takes the red out. Also, the product deoderizes and puts down a stain preventer. I often use a portable spot lifter to rinse out the stain after letting the product set for a few minutes and then use paper towels to blot it up."
2,Nothing 'Resolved',"Resolve Triple Action, Trigger, 22-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 12)After so much delay that I'd given up ... my order for a pack of 12 Resolve Triple Action carpet cleaner arrived! The first problem? There was only one bottle, so the phenomenal discount was bogus! Next the cleaner doesn't resolve anything; the trigger on the spray bottle doesn't work and the product comes out in tiny dribbles. Woops -- didn't resolve a thing."
5,Resolve Powder Carpet Cleaner,"I have been using Resolve Powder carpet cleaner for over 13 years. We live in North East Texas, and I can no longer find it. The largest city closest to us is Tyler over 50 miles, I have checked Brookshire Grocer, Walmart, and Target in Tyler, Brookshire Grocer in Quitman, Walmart in Sulphur Springs, and Mineola Texas, and to no avail. Please tell me where I can get this without having to order it from the net. This is the MOST WONDERFUL Carpet cleaner I have ever used, It will take out most anything. My dog got into the cat food over 10 years ago, He upchucked on the carpet, I used liquid carpet cleaners of every kind, they only made the spot larger. I bought some Resolve Power and the spot disappeared as though through some magic. Please I need some of this cleaner."
1,Starting to go gray,Starting to go gray. Thought i would try this on the grays that are popping up in the front. It was gunky and it didn't look that good. I like the lipstick one much better and have been using that one with great success. Don't buy this one. It's not worth it- try the lipstick version.
3,root touchup,This product is like mascara but presumably with a little more staying power. It is not much larger than mascara either (which I have also tried). I have used it in front at crown of head and it does cover the growing in light roots and at sides also. It goes on easily and lasts a few days. I don't use it often and only to protect my hair from the drying results of doing a complete hair dye of entire head.
2,Disappointing,"Not the best product. I almost sent it back but it wasn't worth the postage. Coverage was limited at best, and the product was sticky in consistency."
5,"fun book! if you like the tv show, you'll love this",this is a really fun book! i enjoyed reading and rereading it! pure fun
2,Not much space to hold your travel papers,"If you are a lone traveler, maybe it will hold your stuff.It does not have any zipper, so it worries me that my passport or my cards may fall off. The leather is artificial with synthetic texture. I don't think it's worth the money I spent to get this."
1,Passport wallet,"I am not happy. After inserting my passport only a few times, the liner started to rip, thus making it increasing difficult to access necessary documents in a timely fashion at the airport. I bought it just before a trip, went out of the country, and am trying to exchange it only to find out the time has expired to do so. Not happy Amazon. This is the second time now in 3 months with a bad product."
1,Not enough space and the leather feels cheap.,This case wallet is pretty small. it doesn't have enough space for all my travel documents.I also noticed that the stitching are coming off and the leather is feels cheap.I would not recommend this to a friend.
5,Great choice!,"Great fit, great color! Arrived early and in great condition, and just in time for St. Patrick's Day!"
2,too small,"I'm a size 18w, 5 7"", and the plus size would not fit at all, i could squeeze in but it was way short and just looked stretched out and ridiculous"
1,Not original Black Jacks,Black Jacks were my absolute favorite candy when I was a kid and still would be if they were still available. The original candy was NOT brown and had the consistency of high quality taffy. What you sell tastes like a cheap imitation!
5,A Book to Savor!,"This children's picture book was designed for children ages 4-8. The story of creation is told in rhyme. Pictures illustrate each day's creation climaxing with God's creation of the Sabbath, the seventh day, a day of rest. This is a book to savor, to read thoughtfully as God's plan of creation is unfolded."
5,Reads like a Dr. Suess Book,I work in a christian preschool over the summer and found this book in the resource room and I feel in love with it. It reads like a Dr. Seuss Book and is very catchy. Was a little long for younger kids (I had two year olds) but was great when they were falling asleep for nap time. It was so great! I recommend this to everyone!
3,Other Books,"The Lady of Shalott, to me, is a poem of interest because of the Arthurian theme.Another example of the tragic figures surrounding these legends, and how obviously hot that Lancelot bloke was, given how all the girls seemed to desperately want him.When the breaks the magical taboo of actually looking at him, rather than via a mirror, her doom falls, and she sails, in death, down a river."
5,Grandchildren in heaven,Our grandchildren watch this DVD over and over again. Great cartoons in a day when there are no decent cartoons left.
4,The best of the series,"This is the best of the Disney Cartoon Classics DVD series, namely because all these Chip 'n Dale shorts are making their DVD debut. A nice Chip 'n Dale starter collection to have until the evitable Walt Disney Treasures collection comes out."
5,Great cartoon!,I bought this DVD for my 3 year old grandson for Christmas. Chip n Dale were always my favorite when I was a child. We watched it after Christmas and this cartoon is still my favorite. My grandson loved it.
5,TEENNENN!,I used to watch it when I was 4 years old and it was great...what to say and I LoVe It MaN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,"Gene Watson is back, sounding better than ever!","The title says it all.. Gene Watson sings.This guy can sing a country song. There is something missing on country music radio and it's emotion and it's honesty. Good country music is missing. Gene Watson brings all the emotion and honesty to the table with his latest record, a great country record.The guy is like a Ray Price or an Elvis Presley.. his voice just gets better and better as time goes by. ""When A Man Can't Get A Woman Off His Mind"" is an instant classic. The tune was co-written by Bill Anderson and originally recorded by Craig Morgan, but this is clearly a song that only Gene Watson can sing..Five stars for this record because it's very powerful, it's diverse, and there really isn't a bad song on the whole record."
4,"Basic, Sturdy Phone","I've had this phone since July 2000. It has all the basics, but by today's standards it is large. It isn't that heavy. I carry it in the sunglass pouch on my purse.I've dropped the phone countless times, and it still works. All the new phones seem to wear out in a year or two. As long as you don't want color, pictures, and instant messaging, it is a great phone."
1,GENUINE ANTIQUE-DON'T BUY EXCEPT FOR MUSEUM,"This phone is truly ancient and huge and NOT AT ALL THIN by todays standards.. But it is at least 3, possibly 4 years old! It used to be a great phone when it was introduced, but it's huge and terrible now and not worth $50, and probably worth very very little if you're looking for a modern phone."
1,Massively overpriced!,"This book presents very basic info on very poorly printed paper. The print quality is VERY BAD! Another reviewer compared it to poor quality photocopies. They are right!Not only should the author be embarrassed, but so should the publisher.Save your money and search on-line for `View Camera techniques'. This book would be overpriced at ten dollars..."
4,highly recomended,"this book was the only book required for a class i have at a big art school. the teacher said it's great, so im getting it."
3,"Better than most, but not better than the Lucky Star TV series","I adore the anime TV Series with a passion and can re-watch it many times (highly recommended). I was actually expecting the OVAs to be just as good as the TV series episodes but I felt a bit let down. A lot of interesting scenarios occur in the OVAs(Kagami/Konata cosplay situations for one example). But a lot of it felt like they were trying to cater to the fans desires too much and it didn't have the same flow as the anime. All that said...it's Lucky Star which has amazing characters and great references! If you're a Lucky Star fan you should give it a try! So it's good compared to many other things, but does not measure up to the TV Series in my opinion."
5,Best Anime Ever !!!,"Oh My Gosh! Lucky Star is the greatest anime ever!! works great, low cost, everyone should buy this! You won't be disappointed!"
3,Lucky Star OVA,"I really enjoyed the series of Lucky Star and highly recommend it. I was hoping that this would bring back the fun of the series, however the OVA had only the Japanese voice track and although it is a good cast I prefer my anime in English. I felt that the OVA was really well done but wish that the American voice cast was used instead of just using the subtitles. It does not reduce the overall quality of the OVA just made it slightly less enjoyable."
5,Works well.,The lock and chain combo are heavy. This is to be expected. Do not try to wear it like a belt or a sash over your shoulders. Your bones will be crushed in a fall. It is thick enough to discourage most bike thieves from even trying.
4,Overkill?,"Bought this to secure me iZip bike at work. This looks like a piece of chain they used to restrain King Kong in the movies! Seriously, this is a leave-in-place lock, you're not riding anywhere with it! Overall design and execution is nice, and the rotating cover over the keyway is a good addition to a lock that will live outdoors. It comes with FIVE keys, which I guess is an indication that they can not be replaced. One of the keys has an LED light on it."
2,We need a book about TYPICAL triplet pregnancies!,I read this book in it's entirety and it scared me to death. THis woman obviously had many health issues besides being pregnant with triplets. I don't think this paints a picture of a typical triplets pregnancy.
3,SuperShopper,Puppet Unicorn Hat- small in size- good for small heads less than 7 inches cir. Kind of creepy because it has pinky red eyes although it is exactly as pictured. good quality
5,The march toward World Government - In Their Own Words,"This is the ultimate resource (along with his 1st one - Secret Records Revealed) for those who are derogatorially labeled ""Conspiracy Theorists"" to prove that there is indeed, plans for World Government by the powerful in politics, business, and the media. From their own speeches/memos/books/letters - hear the truth about the 'Shadow Government' and who really rules our society.You will never look at government, education, the news media...or churches the same way again.I just hope you can find one.......as the book is out of print."
2,Culinary Crafting a Look at Presentation,If your looking for some vintage garnishing and presentation techniques this book will truly teach you the abc's. This is a great place for any cook to get started and learn about food presentation. the book is well written and edited and could be understood by someone who is reading at a highschool grade level. I think this book would be appropriate for young people that are just begining to learn about culinary arts.
1,A Great Disappointment,"A two-part docu-drama that I remember to have been quite striking when first broadcast. Dramatically, it holds up fairly well, although I found it a bit more heavy-handed than I remember it. Some great performances by Powers Boothe, Randy Quaid, Albert Hall, Levar Burton, Veronica Cartwright, Brad Dourif, Meg Foster, and others. But this print is horrendous! Terribly grainy to the point of being out of focus, colors are over-saturated, and full of dust, dirt, pops, jumps and skips. And the sound is muffled, subject to irregular dropouts, and often distorted. I will not keep it in my library. It's a shame because it would have been worth watching again sometime. I guess the studio didn't think it worth digitally cleaning up the original."
5,guyana tragedy: jim jones story,i think the movie is great and it real great. have not seen the moviesince it aired and glad it is finally on dvd. watched it 3 times over and i just love this movie so i give it a 5 star
2,"Entertaining, but highly inaccurate","Powers Boothe, while obviously talented and provided a strong character, he did not capture the real Jim Jones in any sense. This movie is so full of inaccuracies that it is not worth viewing to obtain any true information regarding the Peoples Temple movement. I would recommend some of the documentaries such as Purple Haze or the A & E Biography of Jim Jones-Journey into Madness. I found this motion picture misleading and almost total fiction as I know many, many family members and survivors of Peoples Temple and have written/researched Peoples Temple extensively."
2,Know what you are watching!...source and context tell the story,"This made-for-TV(CBS) film is a textbook example of the media massaging the message. The Jonestown ""event"" happened in late November 1978, this movie was on TV by 1980--within little more than a year CBS is further reinforcing and shaping the public's image and the very mythology of Jonestown. Although it is a second-rate production with poor acting and dialogue (I image the result of haste) the movie's importance lies in what it does not tell you...seeWas Jonestown a CIA Medical Experiment?: A Review of the Evidence (Studies in American Religion, Vol 35)...among others.Watch this film after having consulted other sources and understand how we are manipulated."
1,Guyana Tragedy: Story of Jim Jones,VHS Tape that I received could not be viewed. Returned for credit.
4,"Great Movie, Bad Quality","Great movie. I've heard of Jim Jones but never knew the whole story. Powers Boothe has also been one of my favorite actors since watching the Deadwood TV series. I understand this movie is over 30 years old, but the quality is really bad. I noticed theres multiple releases of this movie. I dont know if any of them have any better video quality over the rest. I would recommend this movie to anyone as long as your are not expecting great or even good audio/video quality!"
3,Great Movie. Poor Quality.,"This is a tough one to rate. The movie is fantastic. The DVD quality is poor.Powers Booth stars as Jim Jones, the People's Temple cult leader who lead his followers to commit murder and mass suicide in the late 1970's. Casting is excellent, as is the portrayal of Jone's rise and ultimate fall in his self-made Guyana jungle community named Jonestown.My only complaint is with the quality of the DVD. Nothing has been digitally remastered. It's as if a novice recorded the TV-run program onto a DVD. The colors are faded and the sound slightly muted. There are white streaks and snow throughout.There are no extra feature bonuses, no behind-the-scene interviews, nothing we've come to expect on DVDs.Despite the poor DVD quality, this gripping movie is sure to keep the viewer spellbound. Were I rating only the movie I would give it five stars."
3,A Spellbinding Film Though Not Entirely Accurate,"This film is masterfully done and will grab the viewer's attention from the beginning. Boothe does an excellent job of portraying Jones. Though the film has great artistic merit and portrays an overall sense of the life of the People's Temple, it fails to convey the true roots of madness that became the driving force of the Jonestown cult. For a better overall survey of Jones' theological presuppositions and personal history, I would highly recommend a reading of David Chidester's book, Salvation and Suicide. Also recommended is the audio broadcast ""The Last Days of Jonestown,"" available from National Public Radio."
1,5 Star Movie - Poor DVD Quality,"Considering how long the studios waited to release this movie on DVD, I was very disappointed with the quality of this DVD. Scenese were cut in mid sentences, the screen jumped on several occasions etc. It looks like the studio simply transfered the movie from VHS to DVD. Unfortunately, I have this movie in VHS therefore I feel like I was cheated, because my VHS copy is much better than the DVD.Movie itself however, is great. Powers Boothe is at his best. A must see movie."
3,Poor video and sound quality,"The video is great, except for the poor video and sound quality. I wish they'd put out a DVD version with clearer video and sound."
2,Bad Quality,"Wasnt what i thought quality, is not good at all. Just not a good picture at all i wouldnt recommend this movie at all."
1,Fully Restored and Remastered? Yeah Right,"Finally VCI Home Video has released Guyana Tragedy on DVD. Months ago we were promised a remastered copy with improved picture and sound. Even the above poster states that this has been fully restored and remastered. But, sadly it has not. For a film that was only made in 1980, I can't believe that a film would have picture quality that is this bad. Honestly the quality of the picture is that of a bootleg, and its even worse than Reel Enterprises version of the film. The video jumps from time to time, it's murky and the sound is like something from a 1930's film.Shame on VCI for bringing out a title that is this bad. My goodness, how hard is it to clean up the picture a bit? They have really dropped the ball with this release, and because of the extremely poor quality, I will re-think purchasing any further VCI titles. Avoid at all costs!"
1,Terrible transfer! to dvd,"When I saw this was realeased on dvd, I didnt even bother to read the customer reviews because I was so excited to see it finally available. I must say when I started watching the first half of the film, I was shocked! It looked like it was printed in the late sixties! Scratches, jumps, cuts in mid sentences, crucial dialouge was missed because of cuts and pops! It is truly unbelievable that this company had the nerve to release this god awful copy of a some great performances. I remember seeing this on tv not too long ago, and it was perfect! I will NEVER buy another VCI release again."
4,Took about 2 weeks,"Took about 2 weeks to receive the movie, but was satisfied when I finally got a chance to watch it. The movie imaging wasn't perfect but was nothing like some of the reviews I read."
5,outstanding,looked for this movie for a long time.it's one of my all time favorite.it came in a very nice package and right on time.thank you.i'll buy from thi seller again.
1,not good,The quality of the video is horrible.It is like someone videotaped from the tv. It had crackles and breaks.The color quality is so bad you can't see some of the film.I really want to send it back.
3,GREAT MOVIE - lousy transfer,"The only reason this doesn't get five stars is because of the quality. I've been looking for this movie for years so bought it anyway despite the warnings about the lousy DVD quality. I had taped this from TV and the tape basically disintegrated. I'm glad I bought this CD but the quality is just as bad as on VHS. My recommendation is that if you have a decent VHS copy don't buy this. If you don't have it, buy this and wait for the release of a better quality DVD."
2,Say What?,"This is a great movie, but the audio and video from 1980 just doesn't hold up. The audio is VERY distorted and the video quality is atrocious. Think twice before slapping down money for this one (and I bought mine new!)."
2,wanting this movie,Guyana Tragedy: Jim Jones Storyi grew up on hearing my mother talking about jim jones and what happened there...also grew up on the movie recorded off of tv.i thought it was really something.nothing grabbs at me like a true story.the tape is now worn and would probably break the next time i watch it.i would love to add it to my collection and for a minute there i thought i had found it(on dvd)....but after reading the reviews i have decided not to purchace it.if a good dvd is made i will deffinatly buy it.
4,Love Waechtersbach - these run a little small,"Let me start by saying I love Waechtersbach dishes - they are heavy and well-made, durable and their colors are fabulous. I like these mugs, but while most of the Waechtersbach items I have (butter dish, dinner plates, salads, soup/cereal bowls) tend to run large, these run small. I have been accustomed to some Pfaltzgraf mugs and they were much larger. These mugs have a good feel, but they are lighter (relatively speaking) than the other Waechtersbach items."
3,Original band was much grittier and more enjoyable...,"A double disk live concert from 1995. John Kay is the one original member and he has surrounded himself with a very talented band but it's not Steppenwolf. The original band was much more gritty. About 40% of the concert are songs they made from the 90's and while I respect and think it's crucial for a band to continue to churn out new material to be relative, the material they create today is pretty mundane. The highpoint for me is that they performed ""Snowblind Friend"", a powerful song about a buddy they Kay to drugs. Of course if includes all their hits including another favorite of mine The Pusher, but they sounded so much better the first time around."
1,Poor Reception (and Poor T-Mobile Customer Service),"Horrible reception. Most of the time my SE T610 displays ""No Network"" or ""No Access"" inside my house. I live in the New York City Metropolitan area, not in the middle of nowhere. My partner has a Samsung R225 with T-Mobile and he usually has 1 to 3 bars. T-Mobile refuses to give me another phone model. They will only replace my phone with the same model (which they have and I still get no reception inside my house). Poor customer service. Will go with another carrier when my contract is up in a few months (and get different phone, as well)."
2,I dont hear it,"I got this phone a year back,i had a Nokia earlier.I never had a problem with my Nokia.But with this one even after a year i never hear it.Mainly in crowded places etc,its never heard.The menu is difficult to Navigate and also everything needs lot of steps.Im just waiting for the year to get over so i can rid of it.I dont recomend it to anyone"
2,not great,"the phone's camera is not that great, dust gets on the camera lens and it is very hard to clean. the text messaging is pretty easy, it spells out the word if you want it to. although, the signal sucks, i dont get great signal unless im in the middle of no where."
3,Gr8 Phone - but hard to c siplay in sunlight,"This is a great phone, but you cannot read the display outdoors in bright sunlight."
2,"poor coverage, hard to use, useless features","I'm in Sunnyvale, CA; where this phone (T-Mobile) has zero reception and my Sprint PCS phone has 3 of 5 bars when in the same location side-by-side. the keys are extremely difficult to use. the calendar/organizer feature is useless; the camera is a disgrace. I returned mine. I hope you avoid the hassle."
2,T-Mobile is the worst,"I've had this phone since February 2004, and have had nothing but problems with it. Dropped calls, spotty network, and VERY poor customer service. I have called T-Mobile on numerous occasions and it would seem that the only job of the reps is to pacify you and tell you that the service will get better. I will not, however, resubscribe with T-Mobile next year, if they do not clean up their act. I was told that I would get reception at my house. I have to walk 4 blocks away for one bar of signal. Little things like that add up. The camera, games, etc. are useless without good solid signal service, and this is where T-Mobile fails miserably."
4,"Good phone, bad provider","I have had this phone since January and have used it an average of 1200 minutes per month. I have been very pleased with it other than it does not have as good of reception as my Motorola V300. Battery life is good-I only charge it every other day. I have not had any problems with it freezing up. The pictures are good considering it is a phone. I've had several people facinated by all the things it can do and it's small size.I would rate T-Mobile 0 stars, however. I have had a problem on my bill every month since I started with them. Their customer service people are extremely nice when I call and fix the current problem, but the next month there is something else wrong. I am counting the months until my contract is up so that I can change providers. The cool phone is not worth the hassle."
3,One minor detail...,"I LOVE the size, the look, the price, the funcionality, the 500 capacity phone book, the voice recorder, the bluetooth, the camera is a nice thing to have, the talk time is OK (not nearly as good as they claim).One minor detail: IT DOES NOT WORK VERY WELL AS A PHONE. At least in Chicago, you WILL get dropped calls and poor reception at times, especially indoors and while driving. I might recommend this phone for light or personal use, but not if you use it for business."
1,Watch out - defective phones from amazon,"I ordered two of these phones last week (for me and my wife) and i activated it yesterday and when i tried to use it, turned out both the phones were defective and wouldn't work. After spending hours on the phone with the customer care and tech support and going to the store in person, i'm still not able to get it working and i'm returning the phones to amazon."
1,Amazon.com CHEATS,"According to a survey, more customers are ordering their cell phone and service from AMAZON.COMBut if you are one of the customers contributing to this, its a big mistake. I have ordered 2 ""cell phone + service""s from Amazon. The first shipment took such a long time, I had to cancel it. The second one is on hold for almost 2 weeks with a message that ""Can be delayed further"". So if you order one of the top 10 bestselling phones from Amazon now, it will take at least 3 weeks for your shipment to be delivered...guess Amazon is waiting for seconds to re-package, huh?"
4,Great Features but not 'looks',"I've used T610 for just 3 months and started getting bored.I feel the features are great,but I'm dissapointed that I can'nt transfer the pictures taken by mobile to my PC using cable.I've contacted the website but was unable to get the required software.It easily gets scratched with my fingertips.The tag to hang, provided is very long and ugly.The musicDJ provide is almost useless.When a tone is created using musicDJ it sounds less than the others.The recorded sound can'nt be used as ringtone and not even clear.The camera is better than the other brands which come under same category(cost,features).The screen is really big than the other brands.The display is good and I'm able to use different images as wallpapers.The memory provided is ample and I can store many ringtones and pictures."
3,Disappointed,"I actually switched from a cellular provider that I was happy with to T-Mobile just to take advantage of the rebates and to get, what looked like, a cool phone. I do like many of the features but I'm also disappointed with the set up of this phone. First of all, the headset and AC adaptor connection is horrible! The attachments are cheap plastic. My car adaptor broke the first time I tried to connect it to the phone. The phone itself has a history of crashing on me like my PC. I've had to remove the battery on several occations to re-boot my phone. I now looking forward to the end of my contract so I can go back to Verizon and get another phone."
3,"Good Features, Poor Reception","To be brief, this phone has a long list of features (bluetooth, camera, color screen, etc) but it lacks in the reception department. On AT&T;'s networks my phone gets poor signal quality where friends' phones--who also use AT&T--get; good reception. Apparently this is a known problem and SonyEricsson ""fixed"" it on their new T630/637 series.If you purchase this phone, please test it everywhere you typically make phone calls; you may find that it does not work."
3,Its okay,"Phone is alright, nothing great. Phone camara is almost useless and costs $.25 with t-mobile to send each pic. and resolution is not great.Best part is the bluetooth technology. Love the Jabra bluetooth head phone.Almost forgot to mention that this phone seems to have chargin issues. Its been 3 mo. and it wont charge and i know atleast one more person who has issue with charging."
2,Not impressed,"I originally liked the looks of the phone just because it looked cool. It arrived this week and I was still impressed. It is small...light...attractive. Then I took it outside and as soon as sunlight hits it, you can't see the screen. The features are clunky...difficult to figure out basic things which i was used to with Sprint. The reception was also terrible. I was able to get 4 bars signal strength at my house, then I took it to work and got no signal. Granted I work in of all places...a building. I then took it to the mall here in Charlottesville to check the signal there and all I received was 1-2 bars...but the mall is an outdoor mall. I am just going to return it and hope I get better service from something other than T-Mobile."
1,the other reviewers are being too nice calling it crap,"To call it crap is to dignify its existence. This phone gets horrible reception, misses calls ALL the time (and doesn't notify you that you missed a call, even sometimes doesn't log a missed call). Now after almost a year and a half I can't hear anything over the static that it generates. There are phone recycling programs, but that would be cruel for me to pass on this junk. The only thing unique and useful about this phone is the infrared receiver so that I can beam my Palm contacts to the phone."
3,Okay,I have this phone for over a year & have following comments on it.Phone reception is bad indoors and in the car.The screen is not visible in bright light.It looks good but not easy to use.
4,Good little phone,"This phone is great because of its huge list of features. Data can be sent in so many ways by this phone that it can connect to almost any other device in someway. It has bluetooth, email capability AND infrared. Not to mention text messaging and wireless web. The camera doesn't take high quality pictures but for quick snapshots it's pretty good. The bad things I have found are that it is often difficult to see the display in direct sunlight, and the menus are sometimes slower that I'd want them to be. Overall though, its inexpensive, has good battery life and is packed with features and I'd recommend it."
2,AHHHHHH,"Anyone new to this phone will not know that there are multiple firmware versions for the t610. Well since I cannot access that menu (the phone locks up) I cannot say which version I have. However I am having LOTS of problems, poor reception quality (supposed to be impreoved with firmware), calls are dropped when the screensaver kicks in (minute or so), and after taking pictures the phone locks up for... dunno I waited 30 mins before trying to turn it off and then it eventually reset."
1,as bad as it gets,That summarize the whole problem. this phone freezes once a while. Poor connection. poor quality
5,Great phone,"This IS a wonderful phone. However, if u plan to use it outside the US or send it as a gift to someone who lives outside the US, don't bother. T-Mobile will put you through hell to give you the SIM unlock code so that the phone can bu used with another carrier. Beware. I have a friend who is still trying to get the unlock code from T-Mobile since December 2003. The phone itself is a good buy. Great features, menus are easy to navigate, stylish design, but could have had video."
3,Warning on the number transfer thingy,"Hello! In Santa Clara California, I could not transfer my phone number using the T-Mobile Customer Service line...I have to go into a T-Mobile store to transfer my phone number from Sprint PCS to T-Mobile. I find this kind of thing really annoying. I bought the phone and service from Amazon to avoid the crowded stores with their lousy customer service, so this was an unpleasant surprise. In addition, the sound quality in my phone is poorer than on my clunky old Samsung phone. On the plus side, the camera thing is cool, and the phone is tiny and very cute. The camera button is incoveniently located on the side of the phone so I keep activating it every time I remove the phone from it's pocket in my purse."
2,You have to be lucky,"Got the phone last week. Found out that when I am not on the network, callers can't reach my voice mail...tried it myself, and all I get is a busy signal.I had set the phone to automatic lock to avoid it turning on when in my pocket...worked well for two days, but on the third day the top four keys along with the joystick stopped working.Called up t-mobile and they said they would send a refurbised model for exchange :(But some of my friends have this model and it works fine for them...I am wondering if I was sent a refurbished model in the first place."
1,Could NOT get mail-in rebate from Amazon.com,I got a postcard from Amazon.com stating that they could not honor my mail-in rebate because my receipt date was after the promotion period (which was NOT true and my receipt was in the promotion period). I emailed back using the Amazon.com rebate information page. All I got was the exact response stated in the postcard. No specific dates were even provided. I also faxed my receipts to a fax number provided in the email response but never got any response.I brought a cell phone from Amazon.com instead of some other websites that had lower prices because I thought Amazon.com is more reliable and will honor their rebates. I was very disappointed with Amazon.com after such experience.
1,Bad Reception...,"This phone has really bad reception. And it cuts in and out alot. One minute it'll be at 4 bars, then the next minute you'll have no service. I am getting rid of this phone."
1,POS phone!!!! dont buy,I sell t-mobile these phones have the highest return rate and the most terrible signal. I hate these phones!!! I will never buy another sony/ericsson phone ever again. ericsson shouldnt have merged with sony. ever since they did they are junk. Get a good camera phone like the motorola v300 or the samsung e715. dont waste your time or money on this i swear trust me.
2,Amazon Lying about talk time,I just called T-Mobile with complaints about my weak battery and told them talk time on the cell phone is 840min according to Amazon's specs for the T610 phone. T-mobile told me the talk time is 5 hours (300min). Who do you believe? I am tired of liars and money-gobbling b*st*rds!
4,What a phone,Well where do I start. It is quite a good all round phone exept from the dodgy camera. It loooks great it has a lot of memory space and it is easy to live with. I think that the camera should have been scrapped because it is really bad. It comes up all blury and hard to see.
1,bad reception,"When I bought it the reception in my area and important streets in springfield were not covered, I thought it is T-mobile service.Then a friend who has an old Nokia 3310, told me he has no problem and the coverage is very good and actually he had the erricson-sony phone but he got rid of it because it was not getting good reception....."
1,weak signal,"The phone has all the fashion stuffs except the signal. I cannot receive calls in my office building and at home. Even if I put it near the window, it also cannot find network some time."
2,Buy the t616,"The problem with the t610 if you do the research is that it was made for europes networks. While any t-mobile rep will tell you this phone was made just for them (lie). It is an international phone so it works on our network as well however the u.s. version works better here it's the t616 available from at&t/Cingular. I would only recommend getting this phone if you travel to europe often, trust me it works great there!"
1,Lousy phone,I have had enough problems to last a lifetime I guess. I moved from Sprint PCS to T mobile (thinking that their Service was good). I think I was wrong in doing that.The Sprint service was working fine. My Sony Ericsson phone does not have any reception at all in my office & has a Lousy reception at home as well!!!!!!!!!!T Mobile sent me a replacement Phone & as well as the SIm card in the hope that their service would improve. Unfortunately (to my horror & utter dis-belief) the service is no better. The service is fine after I checked the SIm on my friend's phone which is a NOKIA. T Mobile refuses to replace the phone with the same features...I will have to shell a good amount of money as well....All in all SOny Ericsson T610 is not a good one. At best I can say that it is a good one by itself..but not for T Mobile I guess.
3,"Great Features, weak signal","I purchased the phone because it had lots of good reviews and everyone kept saying how wonderful all the features are. You even get a free Jabra headset with it. Once I started using the phone I realized that all those features are really nice, but I could not get reception in some places where a friend of mine with an older sony-ericsson phone had no problems. The battery life was about 40% shorter than his. Overall the reception is intermittent and could be better. At first thought I could deal with it, but after a week of missed calls, switched to a different phone with a stronger signal... If you live in an flat area with good coverage, then this wont be a problem, but in the hilly San Diego, its worthless."
2,Needs improvements,"Bluetooth is cool, but this phone freezes up, randomly shuts down, and the camera sucks. Too bad because the display is really terrific."
2,poor antenna,Like the styling but cannot stand the poor reception. I also have a Sony P900 GSM phone and it gets better reception in side by side tests. I do not recommend this phone.
1,Bad Phone... Very Bad phone...,"Maybe it's just me, but this phone is the worst cell phone that I've ever owned. The reception is poor and constantly cuts off during calls. Sometimes turning it on is an ordeal. For example, sometimes when the ""on"" button does not work I have to undo the leather case and open the battery compartment. Then I have to remove the battery and put it back in... that is the only way it will work.The sad thing about this phone is that I bought it new from a reputable dealer (AT & T Wireless); what's even sadder is that I am contracted to keep it for at least a year.The phone looks nice and all and takes decent photos I suppose for a phone, but I already have a digital camera. Why do I need one with my phone?I love Sony products to death, but when it comes to cell phones, stay away from them!"
3,No Speaker Phone??,"The phone looks cool and is light weight. I'm still getting a handle on all the features this offers. Amazon lists this phone has speaker phone feature but I'm still trying to figure out how to use it. The manual does not mention it at all. So, if you are particular about the speaker phone like me, wait until some one clarifies."
3,Very bad reception (T-mobile sucks),"Pros:- small in size- good navigation- bluetooth functionality is greatCons:- Very bad reception. And I don't think its T-Mobile all the time, sometimes its a phone. It looses the connection."
4,Next Generation Mobile,"I was totally impressed about this Cell Phone. This has the best features like integrated Camera, Sleek Model, Can be used in more than 100 countries and has bluetooth technology. I would suggest you to buy this Cell phone if want be with the next generation tech.Thanks"
1,Disappointed T610 owner,"I just bought the T610 and have been disapointed so far. The charging circuit in the phone doesn't work properly (never confirms that the battery is fully charged, even after 8+ hours of charging.) But more important, the phone's reception is very poor! I live in the Seattle area. Once in a brief while, I show all 5 bars on the display, but more often it's only 2 or 3, and a weak 2 or 3 at that. My wife bought the Samsung E105 at the same time. The side-by-side comparison is very interesting. Her phone shows 5 bars (and gets great reception) most of the time; we're both on T-Mobile. I bought the T610 primarily because I wanted Bluetooth, but it's not worth it. My recommendation - steer clear of the T610. If you buy it, I think you'll be disappointed too."
1,the worse quality phone i ever had,"I just got this phone last week. it works fine at the first two days. but until the next week i recharge for the battery, problems appear. this phone automatically turn on and off itself. i had tried to reset the master setting and it won't work. finally i have to say..this is a bad phone..never ever try sony errisson t610!!!"
2,the phone,THE PHONE IS QUITE GOOD -WHICH USES INTERNET.BUT THE DOWNSIDE IS THST THE CAMERA IS A BIT RUBBISH BECAUSE I HAVE GOT IT .THE RINGTONES ARE GOOD AND THE GAMES ARE BORNG .
1,Very Bad Service with Sony Ericsson,"The Service is very bad. They took my phone for service one more than a month back and they have not yet returned my phone. I'm waiting for one month to receive my replacement phone.There customer support center is in Canada and the repair center is in North Carolina. And every time you call them, they say will get in touch with the North Carolina center through e-mail to know the status. This takes lot of time.I never expected this kind of a service from Sony-Ericsson.I will give -5 stars for the service"
1,hangs....,My T610 stop responding to any key press in various scenerio like when I am done with the call or I want to press 1 for messages and so on. It does not respond to any thing...!!!! You wait till it reboots or you manually remove Battries...!!I have exchanged the instrument three times already with same result.
1,Good phone - Useless reception (T-Mobile),"The phone is cool, it has a ton of really neat features and it's free with activation... BUT... The signal strength is so terrible here in Michigan that it is all but useless. Three of my friends have the same phone and they have the same problem. My old Samsung phone gets full signal both at home and in my office but this one bounces between 4/5 bars and 0/5 bars at both locations. It's not that one day it will be 3/5 and 2/5 the next, within 1 second it can switch from 0 to 4 bars and back again. The signal strength bars look more like a spectrum analyzer than a strength indicator. Driving with the phone is impossible, I can't go more than a few miles in town before it drops the a call. Do yourself a favor and get a phone with less form and more function."
2,Bad reception and camera,"Just like the other SE phone, the reception is bad. Also camera has delay, after you push a button, you will see a picture on the screen but that's not the one you captured; the one you captured will be one second delay."
3,Looks nice but very difficult to use,"I bought this phone considering it is much smaller than Nokia 3650 and does not have circular keypad. The major issue is ease of use, No seperate keys for Talk and end call. Every time you are in menus you have to press back button, not able to figure out how to go back to main screen in one click. The back button is embedded in the middle instead of corner, thats easy to press. The picture quality is bad. Another good thing missing is speaker phone, wish they had it. If I dont get used to the interface, I will return the phone and go ahead with Nokia 3650, it is big but it seems to have all the functionality and ease of use.The good feature is it synchronizes very well with outlook but puts the company name at the end of person's name, Wish the sw can ignore that. I would also like to selective synchronization of names if possible."
2,Bad reception,"I bought 2 phones. These phones have lots of good features. UNFORTUNATELY...Their reception is very bad. I also spoke to a friend who has inside info --> most of the returns at that dealer is because of bad reception of these phones..Now, I am waiting to give up my phones after a year. I hope I knew this earlier."
4,"descent performance, cheap price and loads of features","Although the phone didn't live up to my initial expectations, still I will rate this phone as 4 star. The phone is very sleek, very light, good resolution and very nice features.One problem which I found is common with this phone is that it gets stuck in the middle if you try to open 2 applications very quickly. You have to be little patient with this phone. Also, the user interface is only 30% effective when compared to Nokia. But a bluetooth and triband phone with a camera option at this price is what you get if you can live with all these problems."
2,Freezing,"Real quickly as I'm on hold with T Mobile right now. I've owned this phone for 45 days and haven't used it much. Yesterday it began to freeze. I couldn't use the keypad to input numbers during a call, I couldn't turn it off, when I removed the battery to turn off the phone and then reinserted it, the screen asked for a password because it was locked. I never programmed that function, nor did I have a password but continually pushing buttons finally cured this problem.Now T-Mobile will send me out a refurbished phone on an exchange program. This will be interesting because I have a feeling they will just send me out a phone that someone else has returned for the same problem as mine.Not so happy with this phone because I don't need the bells and whistles, I was just looking for a good phone with good reception and Amazon had this on their best sellers list...."
2,allright,"this phone is very pretty, but it has many flaws- it crashes repeatedly, even during phone calls...it smudges quite easily and is very prone to scratching(so make sure to buy a case too)the reception is allright(sometimes there's an echo)-i use T-mobile, and if you look at the manual-you should get used to this phone in time. Bottom line: Not nearly as great as it seems-"
3,Sony EricssonT610 Revealed.!,"I am using this phone for 2 months.The first month it worked fine,then the problems came.It goes off automatically,some times the calls drop[i know it depends on the carrier.The most annoying of all ,the phone hangs up [like a PC].The only thing i admire bout this phone are the really cool features and the stunning looks.but whats the use if the phone goes dead .I think Sony Ericsson's got to do something about this.Thanks guys i hope this review is useful to you."
2,Software hangs!,"As a whole I would not recommend this phone to buyers.Yes, the phone is small, ""cute"" and has nice accessibility to volume buttons and there is a cameraHowever :- the camera has poor resolution- t-mobile reception is awfulin places where other cell phones with tmobile received one or two lines, mine had no signal.after leaving some place where there was no reception and going out into open air, the phone takes upto 1.5 minutes to pick up the signal (sometimes it works if you turn it off and then on again)many times when i change time zones, the cell doesnt pick up the new time and date.- the SOFTWARE HANGS!!the software is awful - it hangs at least once every 24 hrs and often times more.that's enough typing for now...i would suggest you look for a better phone..."
2,Only good for cash back,"This phone is only good for cashback. Reception is very poor. Cumbersome menus, Slow camera, Low resolution, not too good ringtones. Waiting for contract to end, definately wont buy again"
3,POOR RECEPTION!!!,"This phone does everything but phoning well. With the exception of reception and sound quality, this phone is really nice. Its stylish, has lots of cool features... The ring tone is also not very loud even when set to max. the screen is not very bright so its hard to see outside in the sun. But the key is poor reception, which seems to be because of the lack of an external antenna."
4,The phone that took forever,"Im gonna be kind and rank the phone @ 4 stars for the following:-It has the full color screen-All the features work as expected-The camera isnt the best quality, but is what you'd expect-Saves lots of numbers, and organizes them wellReasons it didnt get 5:-Screen gets scratched easily-Ring is soft (im kinda deaf anyways)-Little hard/annoying to navigate even for a techieAll around I'd get the phone again. Watch out though, Amazon almost charged me for the free headset, but I had the invoice saved so It turned out alright. Also if Amazon messes up the order it takes forever to get it organized out straight. But the phone is great."
5,Good phone in a nice package,"This phone is basically the perfect phone. The only feature I miss is a flip style on it. The screen can be difficult to read, but no impossible in direct sunlight. The camera is average, but it's a cell phone not a camera! Good call quality. All in all, very happy with my purchase!"
2,Dont Go for it unless you fell for looks,"I have this phone from past 6 months from T-Mobile, first of all usability is cumbersome, you have to click lot of buttons even for small things. next reception is very poor, my wife has Samsung E105 from T-Mobile, thatworks every where in the house and T610 does not, it will drop calls if i move from one room to other and in some rooms it will have no signal. it only shows half the signal strength of what e 105 shows in most of the places.Dont fall for the looks, its a beauty with no brains."
1,Poor Reception,"There is no doubt the phone is a nice looking phone, but the phone has such poor reception that I have to use my wife's v60 when it is an important call.I have returned the phone 4 times and I know that T-Mobiles service is good in my area (Portland-Seattle), because my V60 works just fine. Unless you live in a large flat city and do not talk while driving, I would strongly stay away from this phone."
2,"A great value for money, but poor reception","This seems like one of the best phones around. The looks are simply superb, the screen is cool, navigation too is easy. I got this phone with Tmobile and was hoping that will get better reception than the Motorola V60g that I have now. Surprisingly, the old phone is able to receive some signal even in places where T610 loses the network.The Bluetooth option is a cool one. With a good Head Set you don't need to press any button to make or receive calls(provided the phone receives the call).The camera could have been better. The resolution is pathetic.The phone does not give any error message when it fails to complete a call due to loss of Signal.Other than this weak reception, and few minor glithes the phone is great."
4,Good phone but...,"Good sleek design, big display, really like the joystick. This phone is really superb but its software sucks. Phone freezes frequently and in many cases you will need to take the battery out to switch it off (because the power switch does not work when it freezes). Another issue is that it won't connect to internet (t-zones in T-Mobile) again without restarting the phone. It appears that the software which controls this phone has some issues. Despite these issues I am very happy with the phone. Like to mention that T-Mobile provides ""the best"" customer service."
2,There are better phones out there,"This phone is unnecessarily complicated. The screen resolution sucks. The camera is virtually useless. Menu navigation is very cumbersome.The only good thing about this phone is, it gets you cash back. In short, I would not buy this phone again. I'm waiting for my contract to get over so that I can get better phone."
1,"Pretty, but not fuctional","It is sleek and stylish and has a large screen and long batt. life, so I thought seems like a nice phone. Then I started using it. There are so many problems with this phone which result from simply poor design. Here are a couple of the more critical. The screen is useless outdoors and in the sun, forget about trying to see it, you need a hood, literally(even using your hand to shade it barely works). The exteral side buttons are not programable, dedicated to camera and internet fuctions ONLY and they are too sensitive, so while talking you inadvertently take pictures or put it in the camera mode(and camera is poor quality) The joystick and the menu are ""cute"" but poorly implemented, the joystick is a button inaddition to the pointing device and you end up pressing the button while trying to nav. thru the icon. The icon, again are cute, but no fast way-shortcut to get to a function, and the list goes on and on.DONT BUY IT."
2,Bad reception and poor battery,"I just got this phone and the talking quality is good only when you are out of the door. It's bad to use it in a building. The technical data is also misleading. I had expected this phone to stand for about 10 days (no need to say 12 days) but it stands only 2 days and I have to recharge it. I charged my previous 3390 once per week for my usage.I got cheated again by Sony for their ""technical data""."
2,No Customer support from mfr,"the freaking power cable quit working w/in a few weeks and neither t-mobile nor sony will fix it for less than $20. Sony took my address and said they would, but it never showed up.Well the phone is rugged! It's been 3-4 years and it still works. It went through the washing machine and half the dryer. It was submerged in a puddle for 30 minutes- it keeeps working.The blue tooth syncs w/ my pc and tells me where to go etc. I buy a $25 access card every couple of months and avoid the taxes. It's been a great little phone."
1,Bad signal,I got my T-610 cell phone about month ago. The signal was very bad either in office or at home. It lost signal very often at home. I had to go out to place a call or recieve a call. Or I had to go second floor and open the window for a while before I make a call.It was very frustrated because you could not use it when you need it.
2,If I had it to do over again...,"...I wouldn't have bought this phone. I get horrible reception pretty much everywhere go when others with the same carrier but different phones do just fine. The picture resolution is far below what other comparably-priced phones are offering today. I consistently ""call"" people from my pocket if I neglect to turn the key lock on. Next time I'll get a flip phone with a decent antenna..."
1,Sony Ericsson T610 Phone,"Horrible phone. I'm surprised it's not in the East River yet. The phone has some nifty features such as Bluetooth and a camera phone. Ofcourse, it's all useless if you cannot even make or receive a call."
1,sony ericson worst phone i have ever used,"i really feel bad that i bought this phone,please do not buy this phone .the user interface is very poor ."
1,Very Poor signal,"Signals reception is very bad. Where other phone works fine, this shows 0 signals and does not work at all."
1,Review by a guy who used the phone for 4 months.,"The phone was working fine initially but now a days, it is getting hung whenever I try the voice mail option. I have to take off the battery(switch off the cell), take off the sim card and again put it in to make the voice mail working..Its effecting my work a lot."
1,T-Mobile has the worst reception!,"T-Mobile is the worst carrier you could ever have. It can drop your call in the middle of the conversation, and the signal is very unstable. It could vary from strong to nothing while you are holding your phone up high. I even got not error messages saying ""no socket available"" when I was trying to check my voice messages at 2 a.m. on a Saturday night. The quality of the line is so poor that you have to scream on the phone all the time and it makes you repeat something simple numerous times! It's so frustrating.... I will terminate it once the contract is up. I would not sign up with them again even if they offer many free minutes because it could turn your good day into a real bad day!!! You can't even carry a conversation over 3 mins without the call being dropped."
1,Highly unreliable toy,"This phone has died once I started to use the bluetooth and voice dialing: the screen froze and remained black. Disconnecting and reconnecting and charging the battery did not help.Also, this phone has much worse reception than any of the phones I owned. So, this phone is a toy which is loaded with useless ""cool"" features, like taking bad quality pictures, or looking at the fragile TFT screen while it works. Ericsson probably forgot that a phone is primarily needed for TALKING!"
2,not what i'd hoped for,"in general, I like this phone, although the buttons are a little too small and awkward to press.however, the camera is absolutely terrible. you have to have really bright lighting to get anything to come out. and i'm not talking just bright, mid day light. i'm talking indoor, flourescent office lighting. outdoor shots look terrible. the worst part is the color. its washed out and everything has a murky brown quality. i took a photo of a white piece of paper and it came out brownish yellow. if you want a TMobile camera phone, wait for the samsung 205. its bound to be better."
3,tempting but no,"This phone looks AMAZING, and I absolutly love that it comes with a free blue tooth headset! However I have had to deal with SONY's tech support with with a laptop I had and it was a horrible experience to say the least. So I am using all of my willpower to not buy this phone even though it looks so amazing."
1,only if you want a camera,i had this phone and it made me so mad i smashed it on a wall. very un-user friendly. only good for the camera.
4,pretty good,"HI! i'm not telling you my name but i will tell you that i bought your cellphone. it;s the best one i've had so far, but it could do better. your probably thinking what does she know about cellphones!? But i make them and so therefore i most probably know more about them than you do. So there! it's pretty good though!"
2,poopy,this phone is horrible! I have no idea what these people are talking about! Don't buy it it's a death wish!
2,"Awesome technology, Poor Quality","I give this phone 2 stars because it has great features including bluetooth, and the Iinfared port among other cool things. I've had this phone for 2 years. Reception Sucks! My buddy has always had better reception when standing next to each other (nokia). And i have had the experience of poor connection wen charging, u have to jiggle it. It is also very slow at times, and had ocassions when it totally bugged out on me. Whats the point in having a cool phone with a lot of features if the reception is god awefull. I expected better from Sony. Im switching to the Nokia 3220."
2,"Style, but not substance",Smart looking phone but poor in performance.- bad reception- poor audio quality- camera resolution poor- very snall keypad (if you text message a lot)
1,Highly disappointed,I was highly disappointed by this phone. My primary concerns are:1. Extrememly poor receptiona and sound quality2. Slow response3. Very poor image qualityI advise not to buy this at all.
2,its horrible,it has the most horrible service in all the land and is an upset because it breaks easliy my phone that i didnt have for half a year it broken and i cant buy a new one.but not only that it has the stupidest features ever.You cant get a good service in a basement or in a car.it studers and cancels your calls.not only that but tapes your recording after the call if you didnt press the cancel button.it has some wierd features in wrong places i would rather have a home phone that my phone.it makes you wait more than a minute for some features and dosent work right ever.
4,Pretty Good Phone,"I really haven't had any problems with my phone, bad service at times but thats not the phones fault i belive it is the carrier. The one thing i don't like about my phone is that the camara doesn't take very good pictures. They are very fuzzy! But overall it is a good phone and it has been good to me!"
2,Screen unusable after 1 year and 4 months,"The phone had always had small problems. Sometimes the screen would freeze for several seconds. Recently, some calls would have heavy static and I have to call the other person back. Then last night, the screen just turned blank. It only shows a white screen with no graphics. I can still receive calls and dial numbers, but without the screen I can't access my phone book nor see who's calling. T-Mobile refused to exchange the phone because they said the warranty has expired. Now I have to buy a new phone."
4,Great phone,I love this phone! My only complaints are it needs more ram and there is noticable flicker on the display. 2mb doesn't cut it for a camera phone. Even when the signal meter is in the red I can make crystal clear calls and have not had any dropped. T-mobiles customer service is a nice change coming from Nextel!
3,liked but not anymore,"When I first got this phone about a year ago I was very excited. Like the other reviewers, PROS include long battery life, light weight, sleek design, and large screen. But CONS are also significant:- Microphone has problem! Ppl always complain how they can hear the background noise soooo well. It's annoying. No privacy, feels like.- Menu button (center one) too sensitive. I would push it to go to menu and it would go to Internet which costs money for my annoying At&t; phone plan.- Camera quality very bad. Blurry. Can hardly see what's in the pictures.In general, I think this phone was very good 2 years ago, pretty good a year ago, and if now, NO need to buy it! Buy the improved ones!"
2,horrible reception,"I have 3 phones:nokia 6610, motorola v60g and sony ericsson T-610.Even with a broken antenna the V60g gives me better reception than the T 610. I have T-mobile on all three phones, so the T 610's poor reception couldn't be because of network problems.The camera quality is pretty poor and I sorely miss the loudspeaker option that is present in the 6610.I feel that the next phone that I'll buy is going to be a motorola; their phones are very intuitive to use as compared to nokia/sony ericcson.Also, before opting for T-mobile - please please please - check the network connectivity in your locality. I have been hanging out of my apartment window for too long now to try to get a signal."
4,good phone,"I was scared to get this phone cuz of some of the negetive reviews that I saw but im happy that I got this phone. it is true that its hard to see the screen in the bright day light and I always have to wipe the screen of cuz it gets dirty, but my biggest concern is the reception of the phone. sometimes I dont have any reception but all I have to do is to look at the phone for few seconds and it would work, I still have not gotten the full reception in my whole area yet but it works just fine. I read a reviwe that says a bar in sonny ericsson phone means two bars in other phone and I am starting to believe that."
2,Not reliable!,"I bought this phone (T610) 6 months ago. At first I loved it, but after a few weeks I started to notice how slow it was. Although it looks cool on the outside, there are too many problems with it concerning the price. The menus are complicated and certain processes take much longer than they should. This phone has freezed many times and is veryyy frustrating to use at times. After removing the back cover to change the camera reflector to the mirror, the battery moved, and I put it back in its correct spot. However when I turned on the phone, it says ""No access."" Do not buy this phone unless you like being frustrated and annoyed the majority of the time using it!"
1,T-mobile service bad,"This phone is great, however T-mobile service is really bad. Lots of dropped calls, and rude customer service agents. If you can help it do not get T-mobile."
3,Effects of use on the T610 - one we don't foresee,"I was happy to get this phone as it was cool and FREE. However, on usage, several problems surface.While there are many good things, including one of the most durable batteries system I have seen, I have a few complaints.The power cord and handsfree phone cord are not standard jacks.. but, ""specially"" designed for this phone. The jacks get loose and to charge your phone, besides plugging in, U have to attain the carefull balance of a tight rope walker.The blue tooth connection is a little slow. This was my first experience with blue tooth.. but, I am a bit disappointed with that.Overall, the phone is OK"
3,Another medicore SONY item.,"I was lured by this phone sleek looking as well as the Sony label. Poor Judger I was! Here some of the many cons:1-Extra-light with the least shock-resistance frame. Expect alot of scratches from nowhere.2- Worst keypad I have ever seen.3-Software glitches: Expect the phone to freeze while callling and dont be astonished by as many as ""10 mintues"" to get it up and running.4- Low battery lifeAll in all, I dont think that this worth the buy."
2,"poor reception, overall bad functionality","I have had this phone for a week now and today I had to go exchange it for another one. The phone suddenly will not turn off and has a blank white screen. It won't do anything. The man at the T-Mobile store said the battery stopped working properly and I needed a new phone. The battery was charging all night long and then this morning the battery died. It is extremely hard to get reception. I am in a major metropolitan area in Southern California and have to try at least twice to make any calls, to find a signal, which is a weak one at best. I am very disappointed with this phone and with the fact that I will be without a cell phone for 5 days while I wait for a new one to ship from the factory. Hopefully the newer one will work better."
2,Great device - mediocre phone,"When it comes to owning gadgets, this baby is a must. It can do so much - the camera is fun, the organizer is pretty good, the color screen is excellent, bluetooth has show-off swagger and connectivity and the games are a lot of fun. The downside, this is certainly not a great phone. Its signal reception is mediocre and it suffers from a weird combination: the user of the phone comes through extremely loud on the other side, while the T610 user can barely hear what the other person is saying. This makes you talk even louder, thinking you are not heard and you get the picture. Being so small, the phone also requires you to either put it close to your ear or close to your mouth. In summary - in every non-phone activity this is a superb device, but as a phone it is middling."
2,Don't bother,"I was very excited to get this phone. It looks and feels great. However, the phone is extremely quiet. Try having a conversation outside where cars are whizzing passed you and you cannot hear a thing. Using the Bluetooth headset renders the same problems. Also the phone will randomly crash on you and the keys stick after a few months use. I'm in the market for a new phone."
1,THIS PHONE IS HORRIBLE! What a disappointment!!!!,"I should have known because of Ericsson's past that this phone would have issues. First of all let's start with the display... The display is so poor that it renders the phone useless in daylight. The screen is impossible to see even with the highest contrast theme enabled. Obviously, quality control was asleep behind the wheel with this one. Second, the reception is very poor. The phone drops calls all of the time. I know it is the phone because my previous phone did not do this. DO NOT LET THE LOOKS OF THIS PHONE FOOL YOU! If you can, get the Motorola V200."
2,Huge number of features,"Great features - except for the phone one. Seriously - Bluetooth, IR, good phone book features, nice color display (though it washes out if you are using polarized glasses). However, I get much weaker signals (and call quality) on this phone vs. my previous one. If everywhere you would use the phone has strong signals, you may be just fine - but if you are on the edge, this is not the phone for you, unless you value the non-phone features more than it working as a phone. :)"
4,Love it,"I just bought phone and find it easy to use,easy to setup and also connect to other bluetooth devices.I only wish I could change fonts to larger size"
1,Beware of phone activation,"T Mobile activates the phone the date in which it is ordered and therefore, you are billed for days in which you do not yet have the phone. T Mobile is aware of this and obviously takes advantage of this to overbill their customers. For each customer the amount may be small. I didn't receive my phone for a few weeks so it was larger but given the number of customers, the amount is likely to be very large."
1,AVOID AT ALL COSTS,I purchased this phone thinking I was upgrading from the T68i and was sorely disappointed.Technically speaking the phone has1) horrifically bad reception2) bad voice quality on either end--it's hard to hear others because it picks up too much resonant noise3) bad legibility on the screen...that's euphemistic...you can't see anything on the screen at all when you're outside4) it freezes constantlyI am not the tech wiz...I like to have a powerful phone that works well but may I assure you this isn't the one... it's getting returned.
2,GOOD PHONE BUT BAD SERVIE,I bought this phone in march. The thing is this phone has nice features but either t mobile service is bad or the phone sensors are weak as reception is bad. I called up T mobile several times and they said that they will take a look at the reception and put new towers if required. They did not live to their word as expected. I am thinking to file a lawsuit against t mobile to have such a bad reception and not living up to their word. The thing is the phone works well when i am outdoors but does not work well in indoors. So try other phones. I know ATT phone works well in my house since I had one before.
2,Looks good but theres more to looks...,"I have had this phone for around 3 months so far. I really love the appearance of the phone but it is very diffacult to do some things on it. For example, it is hard to text message compared to other phones. You have to click the numbe rof the letter yiou want and then choose the lettrer and hten press ok for each letter instead of clicking or doubleclicking th emumber of the lette ryou want. Another thing was that it is perhaps too small... that i always would lose it in my purse. But the camera works ok, I might add the nokiA 3650 WORKS MUCH BETTER AND HAS A VIDEO SURVICE AS WELL..)My dughter has the Nokia 3650 and it has much better fixes and easier to text. It also takes pictures much clearer and has a better screen even thou it is big. I wished I had choosen that phone."
4,"Great phone, just one flaw","The scroller button in the middle is used for both moving around the screen and to click enter. Sometimes when you try to go up and down, it registers as pressing enter and it does get frustrating. Other than that, its a great buy."
3,it's just a phone,"I will make this short.the T 610 is a really good looking phone. Small, but with a solid feel. the metallic finish make the phone attractive, however prepare to clean often. Nice bright screen when not in the sun light. Don't expect more than a phone. the t 610 don't have a lot of features, at least when compared to my old nokia 6800. the camera is useless. Reception on T mobile is bad.so far no major software problems..the factory games are lame. oh i almost forgot to mention that the keys are tiny."
4,good phones for the price,"its a good phone, very compact and handy ...looks good.signalwise is ok ...but too many people have it..very common phone .blue tooth is good..only disadvantage is doesnt have speaker phone.difficult to see the screen in sunlight."
2,You get what you pay for!,"Pros:- Jack of all trades, master of none.Cons:- Phone crashes and hangs. Only way to restart is by removing the battery- Screen resolution is poor. Barely visible in sunlight- Horrible reception- I went through 3 phones and finally gave upNokia 6600 is where you should be spending your money."
2,It's the cheapo headset that comes with it or nothing!,"The phone is great--IF you like using proprietary headsets! Don't buy this phone unless you enjoy using a crappy headset, as namebrand headsets will not work with it."
5,Best cell phone for the price!!,"PRO:1. Bluetooth= no more cables!!2. Compact and good battery life3. Price= The best value4. GSM TRI BAND 900/1800/1900, unlock the phone and you got your self a WORLD PHONE. Use any SIM card!!5. Hackable= if you have then unlock kit, you can change the language to eg: chinese, french, dutch, etc!!CONS:1. Screen is hard to see in sun. Where all phones are hard to see in sun anyway.2. Live signal meter = they fluctuate alot, NOT snapshot like others.3. BUGGY = this is because TMobile ships the phone with the OLDEST firmware! buy terminator dongle and upgrade the firmware.you can get the unlock kit from http://home.comcast.net/~kayaa . They also include the software and language packs!!! check it out.. :D"
2,Phone will freeze,"Got this phone for about 6 months, and overall it is ok, not as user friendly as Nokia, but get used to it. One bad thing is this phone will freeze itself. Try to exchange with another phone, but T-Mobile exchange program only give a refurbished one, not a new one, and after exchange, only have limited warranty."
3,A decent phone with faults,"I've had the T610 for 2 yrs now (T-Mobile).Pros: The phone is compact well built and has served me well for 2+ yrs. Battery life is decent. By and large, I like the user interface as well. Bluetooth has been reliable.Cons: Signal reception is weak although to be fair one can't entirely fault the handset. Volume level for rings and voice is low as well. Since the past 8 months, the joystick has started flaking out; it responds only to upward movement!"
2,Unintuitive UI - Joystick Prone to Breaking,"My wife and I both have this phone, and while it is an acceptible gizmo with plenty of features, after over a year, I still hate the UI compared to Nokia. Maybe subjective, but I have to hit waaay too many buttons to get things done.The joystick has gone wonky on both of our phones, I'm guessing this is not uncommon.Not enough space to store more than a couple of poor quality photos."
2,Not happy with the phone,I had lots of issues with this phone. There were bugs in the phone and lost of dropped calls. The pictures were so small to be near worthless. I ended up ditching the phone due to the troubles with it. I am not recommending it.
2,Problems,"I've had the T610 for almost a year and it has low reception quality compared to other phones of the same service provider and had enormous problems with static during calls. If it weren't for these two problems, the phone is mediocre at best. The features of the phone are great: Bluetooth, infrared,and sync. However, the relability of the phone during calls is poor."
1,The worst phone that I had ever bought,"The phone is slow, and the keybooard is too responsive. Sometimes I press one number and it is dialed twice. When I answer calls usually they are put on hold. I wont buy any other sony ericsson product ever. At least mobile phones. Also, sometimes the home charger does not charge my mobile. It is really bad."
2,Pretty looks ugly performance,"It is a bad phone when it comes to performance. I had many phones (GSM and non-GSM; USA and abroad) in the past and this one rates lowest in performance.Signal reception is bad. I always hear some strange electronic flash noises. I was once told by a mobile phone company representative that this phone is not high on performance. I tested this phone along with some other brands from same phone provider (T-mobile) from two different locations (work and home). This one failed with a poor grade.Only feature I liked is the ability to sync contacts on this phone and Outlook contacts on laptop, wireless.No wonder they give $150.00 back on this phone. Looks like even phone maker wants to get rid of this from their warehouse!!!"
2,"Reception, what reception?","I can only speak about Cincinnati, Ohio where the reception driving around is shockingly bad, 4 bars to 1 bar in a second, or even 3 to 0 bars isn't exactly working for me. I can look down a the phone and get 3 bars then put the phone up to my ear and get NO reception. I have version RS1 of the software and I have heard getting it upgraded will help, we'll see. Old Nokia is the same area worked fine.Rest the of the functionality is awesome, I'm just praying I can impove the reception."
3,ring tone volume hard to hear,"I bought this phone when it first came out so I've owned this phone for over a year now. The major drawback is that the ringtone is hard to hear in any ringtone other than 'old phone.' The features are very nice, but not being able to hear the phone ring is a definite flaw. Even on the loudest setting, it is still too low."
4,Rebates made this purchase even more appealing,"I was shocked at the price of this phone! After the mail-in rebates, I paid absolutely nothing and receive free money in return! The reception is comprarable to any other phone--so I've had the ""typical"" cell phone complaints. Its so tiny and compact, I can just stick it in my purse and go! The camera feature, colors, graphics and special 'tricks are hot--and I use them all of the time! Although blue tooth technology is typically a 'working professionals' feature (maybe because the devices needed to support and use it are a little pricy) I would recommend this phone for a younger audience because its cute, fast and pretty reliable."
2,Not recommended,"I have a T-mobile service in Miami, but I used it all over the east coast. The reception is pretty bad everywhere, a lot of noise, the sound is not clear also I have lot of dropped calls. When I called customer service they say we cannot guarantee service in all the areas, even in those painted as covered in the national coverage map. In some places I had no signal whatsoever but my friend who has the same service with a Nokia phone had three bars. In addition to that the preloaded games are boring like the ""colorbug"" and T-mobile doesn't have downloadable games for this phone. The camera is really bad, low resolution, no zoom and useless with poor light. The internal memory is small and you have to erase pictures all the time. If you have big fingers just forget it, it will be a nightmare to dial. The screen is pretty clear and bright, but that's it ..."
2,This Phone is Junk!,"I've been a T610 owner for about 4 months. The phone has a sleek design, decent camera functionality, and well, I'll skip all the details you could get from an ad. Let's cut to the chase. The T610 is a horrible phone. A common problem among many T610 owners, is that the phone freezes for no apparent reason. You cannot turn it off, half the buttons malfunction, and you are left with removing and reinserting the batter more than a couple of times. This has happened nearly 5 times in 4 months. My sister can attest to the same problem.Here are more annoyances. You cannot disable Increasing Ring. The phone will occasionally fail to charge. Loading themes are slow. My final gripe is that the power button might be too difficult to reach.I think the T610 is a mediocre phone. Oh, I forgot to mention bad reception. Replacing my old Nokia 8290 with this phone was a bad idea."
2,Terrible reception,"I have been a T-Mobile subscriber for a couple of years. I recently got this phone and compared to my older Samsung S105, this phone has a horrible reception. Also, a lot of times you just lose the network and have to manually select the network.A phone's main functionality is talking. There's no use in packing all the functionality if you cannot talk/hear clearly."
1,T-mobile follow's unethical practices- bad service,T-mobile customer service is bad. they will charge your bill and refuse to investigate the documents. i had to report them to fcc
2,Only reason to buy is for the bluetooth,"Other than the bluetooth (which is wonderful), this thing is a major pain. Batter runs down fast; keys are too small; menus are convoluted; reception stinks.The camera is ok, but not at all essential...as is the color screen."
4,Pretty solid and worth the wait!,"Like the other reviewers I was totally stoked on the Clay People's last album and I was beginning to think that it would be the last we'd hear from them, so imagine my surprise! Anyway, I've been listening to it for about a week now, and initially I was a little disappointed, if only because the bar was so high from the Clay People's last effort. By about the third listen it really started to grow on me. I think this just might be one of the best albums I've picked up this year and there have been some good ones! Overall I love their sound and there are only a few ""weak"" songs. The Clay People are back with a vengeance! The song ""Lost"" alone is worth buying the CD for, catchy and hooky and just want I'd expect from them. I hope they don't wait another 9 years to put out another album!"
2,Cropped images,"Some of the full-page reproductions are cropped - in the case of very well-known images like ""Singing In The Rain"", this is pretty painful to look at. This would be a fine, low-priced item otherwise."
2,Earbuds don't hold up.,These earbuds had pretty decent sound but I had two big problems with them.1/ They didn't fit quite right. Especially my left ear was irritated by these buds.2/The padding wore out quite quickly around the edges leaving a hard plastic to irritate my ears.
1,Too huge to use,"I was looking forward to these, as traditional earbuds fall out of my ears with the slightest jostle or bump. I couldn't figure out how something this big is supposed to fit into a space the size of an ear opening. They are 1""x3/4"" big. I passed this around at work and nobody else could figure out how to make them fit, either.Maybe that's why the only picture of them actually IN an ear is a drawn one."
3,"An okay start, but needs improvement.","I would've preferred to have equal focus on both Catherine and Vincent as it was in the show not just focusing on Vincent. Also, there was some time of the book focused on a flood in the tunnels. I didn't really care for that. It didn't move the story along. But the main part was alright."
3,How odd.,"I'm relatively new to Beckett, and so my only point of comparison is ""Waiting for Godot"". Look elsewhere if you want more of the majesty and humor of that work, but ""The Lost Ones"" does have its own charm.Give Beckett credit, he creates a world of his own, and unpacks it in exhaustive and minute detail. The complex social patterns that develop among the pitiable inhabitants is perhaps of greatest interest. All of this is described in Beckett's characteristically dense prose.Despite being serendipitously timed and thus receiving the Nobel Prize for literature, ""The Lost Ones"" is not itself a major work. Whether this particular experiment is enjoyable to you is probably a matter of taste, but it does have the advantage of brevity; like a Ramones song, if you don't like it, it'll at least be over before you know it."
3,not as good as super session,"Most of the songs are good, but Bloomfield's guitar playing lacks the fire of his earlier work. Maybe Al Kooper could have helped inspired him."
2,Needs an update and a heavy edit to reveal the story better,"This is the required text for a Michigan History Course I am taking at a local community college. Each chapter is long and lacking a true theme; I would describe each chapter as a collage of arcane and dense factoids in a topical fashion concerning Michigan History. The content in many chapters overlap and the lack of solid themes in each chapter, combined with names, dates, and too many statistics make each chapter difficult to summarize and assimilate. The authors are both deceased, Dunbar died in 1970, and May in 2003, so it could further use to be updated, and given a more modern analysis of the material. This book should be about 2/3 shorter. It needs heavy editing; someone to look at the content - really analyze it, then cut out the dead ends and dried leaves. Michigan has an interesting past, but you have to wade through a lot of minitiae to get it out of this book."
3,"Great book, but...","I love the artwork in this book and I have a lot of fun reading it to my young son. Each page of the book depicts a different animal: ""I is for Iguana"", etc. However, I was mildly surprised when I noticed that the R page has a pretty basic typo (""R is for Racoon"" instead of ""R is for Raccoon""). Obviously, it's nothing major, but it's somewhat irking since the book is meant to be a learning tool. I also think that some of the chosen animals are a bit esoteric for a children's book (Quokka? Nuthatch? Uakari?) It's a beautifully designed book, however, so if you can overlook these flaws, you will probably enjoy reading it over and over."
5,I heart adidas,I love this style of shoe! I've had them in sooo many different colors. After the injuries I have had to my feet these are very comfortable shoes. Ill buy them again...no doubt
5,Sent as gift - Christmas came early for this guy,He said that the shoes fit - to that means that Amazon was right in the sizing. He liked them a lot - he said that they were comfy and light.Thank you - from me - Amazon for the comfortable price of $29.00. Very nice!And He says thank you - To Amazon for coming through with this miricle shoe.
5,A Rock Revolution,"I just flat out have to tell you that this is one of the best and any ABB fan must have this to experience the original sounds of this group. The ""early sounds"" are so tight. Makes me remember being there in Byron. The sound quality of the recording is quite good and brings back the jammin' sounds that made the Allman Brothers one of the ushers of Southern Rock. I favor the first day recording over the second, but both are superb. After some 33 years, the sounds are still classic and fresh. How is that? Because the Allman Brothers will remain one of the benchmark bands of rock. Favorite songs are Elizabeth Reed, Whipping Post, and Statesboro Blues. Whether the Brothers wrote it or re-arranged it, the sounds on the Festival album are on any real fan's ""must have"" list. Buy, I promise you, you will not be disappointed. Trust me!!"
3,Historical?,Baught this for a friend at his request. He felt this video has historical sygnificance. I did not view this or read any reviews on the Lost Years.
5,Jesus Learnt Yoga in India,"This is exactly what I wanted. Why Bible does not let the World know that Jesus travelled to India, learnt yoga in the monestry in Tibet and came back to Jeruselem to teach. Christians will be very happy to know that the lost years of Jesus in the Bible were actually spent in India. His life was destined to travel to the country of Yogees and Rishies. There is no FALLACY to hide the TRUTH! Wake-up CHRISTIANITY and let the WORLD know the truth. The emegence of Jesus, after crucifixion, from the cave was actually the power of YOGA, which he had learnt in India.ACCEPT THE TRUTH, even after two thousand years! The Indian MYTHOLOGY has predicted the birth or Jesus and called him ISA."
5,KISS Guide to Organizing Your Life,Great book! I also took a course by the author and it was great.The book is easy to read and has some good advise that i s easy to implement and use in everyday life.
5,Soothing,"I live in Asia, and I've heard the Chinese musical instrument ""erhu"", since I was young. Erhu has always been use for sad songs or accompany sad stories. What Jia Peng Fang does with erhu in this cd is a refreshing and excellent adaptation to other western instrument accompaniment. Also, this cd is truely a great compilation of the best songs from 2 other of his cds. I highly recommend it!"
4,Lavi from Israel,"Excellent intro to the Eruh - The Chinese violin, also excellent music for relaxation."
2,Terrible,"Without getting ugly, I thought this album stunk. I love soul/funk/motown-- but these tracks are all very dusty and random. Maybe if I had grown up listening to British radio and thier idea of pop, I would appreciate this more. If you are looking for a good ""it ispired Jamiroquai"" CD, by the Japanese import called ""Jay's Selections""."
2,Where's the beef?,"Okay, I was shocked to see Jamiroquai's name on a new album, and reading the fine print made me realize the obvious. Funky enough, I've read about most of these songs in JK's interviews. My main beef with the CD is this: where's James Brown? where's Sly and the Family Stone? where's Stevie Wonder? Roy Ayers? Oh, lemme guess, there'll be a #2 CD sometime next year. Gimme a break, man, this CD is pure marketing to sucker people's money, this is not about the music, but about JK's latest Ferrari. No real surprise, Jamiroquai's latest albums have started to suck, and JK's trying to find other ways to fund his lifestyle. Sell some Ferraris, man."
3,Just not up to the Late Night series,"Nice to have it no doubt, though out of the Late Night series, this is definitively below the standards set. Try the Tommy Guerrero or the Kid Loco ones, they take it to another level.Word up.8"
4,Good but ...,"I think the selection of songs on this album are great. Hopefully by now you realize that this is not a Jamiroquai album, but rather an album of songs that Jay Kay of Jamiroquai likes a lot/influenced him/etc. None of the obvious funk hits that you might be aware of already. My only gripe with this is the really brief commentary. The cd booklet gives each song one or two sentences by Jay Kay. That's it. I really would have appreciated a bit more background info/analysis of these particular songs/info I may not know about the artist. Otherwise a nice cd and if you're into Jamiroquai you will probably like the cuts."
3,Nice Pillow -- But Super Stinky!,"Nice pillow, just what I wanted, but when I gave it a good cuddle and inhaled I almost gagged. Smells very strongly of bird! Guess I've always been spoiled with super fancy down pillows that have been washed a hundred times. From what I've learned since researching the issue, this is common in cheaper feather pillows and will fade with time. Washing or letting it air out is an option. As long as it does indeed fade, I'm happy enough -- just don't buy this expecting to sleep on it right off, or you'll be sorely disappointed.Update: It took awhile to air out, but the smell is now completely gone (it took about three weeks). I love the pillow now; my only complaint is that the feather stems pop out of the pillowcase now and then and feel like little needles. However, this is easily fixed by doubling up on pillowcases."
2,Very flat pillow,"I'm not sure what I was looking for but usually I spend no more than about $7 on a pillow and I saw this had feathers and a little down, but when I received it I was really let down (no pun intended).This pillow lays very flat and has no body at all. I use it as a base pillow and keep on using my cheap synthetic pillow. Save your money and go with a cheaper pillow."
3,not too bad,"Despite the fact that the author tries to balance out Jenna's good and bad characteristics, she's not somebody you grow to love, as with Scarlett O'Hara. And the love at first sight premise is stretched a bit."
3,Offers a basic over-view of various methods,"Being a wood burning artist, myself. I try to purchase all books available, on Pyrography. ""Learning the Art of Pyrography"" by Al Chapman, offers a very basic insight into wood burning. It did not offer much content, only lightly explaining various methods. If you are new to this form of art and want to get started, this will give you some clues. Including the purchase of tools, tips & cleaning. Don't expect to find detailed information on techniques. However,if you're really serious and want something more indepth. . . . I would suggest Bob Boyers, ""The Amazing Art Of Pyrography."" This book is a MUST! Al Chapman's book does include nice photos of wood burnings."
4,Learning the Art of Pyrography,"This book is a good beginners introduction to the wonderful world of Pyrography. Lots of color and illustrations with easy to comprehend text. I was a little disappointed in the photo references, which show an American made burning tool being used. This tool is not readily available worldwide and may deter a potential Pyrographer from pursuing the art any further. There are many other tools available for creating this art and it's a pity these options were not suggested in this book. The upside of the book is it's clear and precise layouts and (disregarding the obvious tool brand loyalty) the demonstration photos and sketches are first rate. I would have liked to see a bit more information on Pyrographing paper and gourds....Maybe Mr Chapman will honour us with a Vol.2? I think this book is must have for any Pyrographer, as any book of this type is always handy as a reference guide."
4,Pleased as punch,"Have had this book for a couple of years now,and I love it. It has been very helpful in my endeavors with this craft"
5,Very informative and helpful.,"This is a very well written book, I'm not an editor, however, it was easily understood, the instructions were very good with photographic examples. I feel this book will help me to improve the quailty of my work and help me in choosing the tools that I need to make a quality product."
5,A Feel-Good Album,"""Runaway Feeling"" is one of many catchy songs on this great pop album. It reminds me of a small gathering of friends with six-packs of beer, barbecue and story-swapping. This is a good album to play in your car during long trips or at gatherings like the one just described. This album has no digital effects or studio tricks; just great, organic, good-timey tunes."
3,A FEW Good Songs,"Maybe I was putting too much expectation on Matthew's band, but the songs really weren't what I was hoping for. I could feel the influence of the other 2 & I'm not a fan of either one. Still, No Blue Sky holds a lot of Matthew Sweet's essence. It's melancholy as much of his earlier tunes & it has a really relaxing melody.If you're hoping for something with a Matthew feel to it, this album will disappoint. However, maybe fans of the other 2 artists will really dig it."
5,a reader,"This was by far the best book I ever read and positivly the most far reached detail book I ever read. Tad Willams makes the most vived worlds. It almost brung me to tears to see it end (but theres always the Green Tower!) so I recommend this book to any reader, because it's simply the best."
4,tad williams does it again,"i remember when this work first came out...i raced my young self to the book store in a frenzy. now, almost 10 years later i pick it up once more. and i still got caught up in the story. staying awake until three in the morning because i just needed to know what was going to happen next. this is a wonderful book that again captures the mind, just as williams did the first book. highly recommended"
2,set-up for third book,"I'm the type of fantasy reader that will plow through 1,000 pages in 2 days if the book is good enough. This one took me 6 months - it just couldn't hold my interest. In the meantime, I read Brandon Sanderson's Mistborn trilogy and Patrick Rothfuss' two new books - both series I find much better than this one. I feel like this entire second book is just setup for the third one. I'm annoyed enough I might not bother finishing the series."
3,Finally things are hapening 3 1/2 stars,"I don't have that much time for reading, this time spent is precious. After reading the first book I had to think long and hard if I was going to continue to invest time in this series. I was seriously frustrated with the long winded writing style of this author (like I tell my extroverted teenager: you don't have to say everything that goes through your mind!)...This author seems to write down every tiny little piece of detail he can think of.I decided to continue on and was not frustrated in this sequel. I didn't have to speedread my way through as much long winded explanations, there still is a lot...but it is much easier to find the story. The pace is much better. So, it is an interesting story so far, but not a great one. I will read on."
4,An excellent series!,"I have owned and read this series before, and was thrilled to pick up new copies. The series is excellent!"
3,The Journey...,"This definitely had the feel of a filler book, setting up the final book of the series. This book just felt like all the characters were on a journey that never ended. Not enough action I guess is what I am saying. No, I'm not slamming it, because I thought the climax was pretty good, but I couldn't help feel relieved when I had finished it. I do think there is great potential for the final book (1600 pages in 2 paperbacks), but I hope the future books don't take as long for something to actually happen."
3,Shame on the Publisher,"Love the series, which is why I also purchased the Kindle edition. However, the publisher needs to hang their collective heads in shame. Not only is the Kindle price a dollar more than the paperback, it was loaded with misspellings, missed punctuation, and in many instances wordswerejustcrammedtogether. Is there no such thing as proof reading or even spell check any more? My guess it was typed by non-English speakers. This is not the first instance of these types of errors, have found this to be fairly common in many Kindle editions. Not acceptable."
4,Much improved sequel to first book,"SOF picks up where Dragonbone Chair left off. It is much faster paced than Williams first book and I found it much more enjoyable. I especially enjoy the way he brings the church into the politics and struggles of Osten Ard. The Hero Simon is much more mature and not the annoying character he was in the first book. The plot unfolds as foreshadowed in the first book, without too many unexpected twists. The Cadrach character is very intriguing and Prince Josua reminds one of Hamlet. You can almost predict tragic ending for him in the future. The way Williams jumps from sub-plot to sub-plot very rapidly is distracting, but forces you to keep reading! I can't wait to read the last book"
1,Blacklisted - Georestricted - Not Free SF Reader,"The conflict in the ice could make you feel that biting, terrible cold,so that was very well done. Simon, no longer a boy, but a man capableof taking care of himself, has done the fantasy thing and won the swordfrom the dragon.Prince Joshua, in the meantime, while waiting for the sword, hashis own problems with battles and politics, and must try to reach theStone of Farewell, while surviving the bitter winter that his nemesishas brought about.4 out of 5 (1 out of 5 for georestrictions)"
2,Not as described.,"This book was supposed to be as new and unread. It had been read, cover torn slightly, and spine creased. Price was not in line with condition."
4,Intriguing...,"The second book of Williams' epic ""Memory, Sorrow and Thorn"" is better than the first because it moves faster and adds much to the plot of the overall series. There is more action seen in this book as well as lots of interesting plot development. However, the book is once again bogged down by too much description and detail. Nonetheless it is a book that is worth the money of fantasy readers."
5,One of the best Fantasy series I've read in a long time.,I rate this series up there with Tolkien and Terry Brooks. It has all the items nesessary for keeping you glued to it.
3,Middle book blues,"'The Stone of Farewell' is the middle book of Tad Williams's 'Memory, Sorrow & Thorn' trilogy, and as such it is a bit of a mixed bag. The positives include appealing characters, several interesting plot lines and a comprehensive back story for his world. The negatives include a slow paced and somewhat mundane plot. The whole book feels like Williams is maneuvering the pieces around on the chessboard to get them where he wants them for the final book without regard to making the journey compelling. This wouldn't necessarily be an issue, except 'The Stone of Farewell' weighs in at 700+ pages in paperback. This was a definite step back from 'The Dragonbone Chair'."
2,Poor design,Specs say it will hold a 5/8 inch diameter rod. I wasn't able to use it with a 1/2 inch rod without having to bend the rod holder out so that it would hold a 1/2 inch rod. It wasn't an easy task. Made in China so I guess you have to expect this.
4,Aged Brass Color is not True,"Just received these brackets and they're just fine except for the aged brass color is not true to what is on the screen. It is considerably darker, so if you're looking for something more golden, best look further."
5,worked perfectly,I needed something that would extend pretty far from the wall. Extending these all the way was exactly what I needed. And another perk is that I can reuse them and just adjust it differently if we move and I need a different size.
4,Item seems very sturdy and satisfactory,I found that this particular item was not suitable for my expected use of it and so have not actually used it. I believe it would work quite satisfactorily in appropriate situations.
5,"Umbra Adjustable Wall Bracket, Black","Umbra Adjustable Wall Bracket, Black; it is what it is. I bought these to reinforce a curtain rod I was hanging heavy black out curtains on"
2,Didn't need,"You don't need these brackets for the Umbra 88-120"" Drapery Rod. The box with the rod in it will have all three brackets already inside. These brackets are actually harder to use and install."
1,"Wrong, they sent me something other than pictured.","If you look at the product you will see that it is adjustable, this is what I ordered. This is not what I received. So my review is send what we order...or don't send anything.Thank you,Kathy Wells"
2,Definition of Mediocre Power Metal,"Well, my title pretty much explains this review. I burned this CD from my friend thats more into power metal, but he doesnt like it that much, and i like to think i know whats good in that genre, this CD isnt bad, but its definitely far from good. Why would you take blind guardian or iced earth out of your CD player for a second to listen to this? It's just a tribute to those bands but worse, enough said i think."
4,A thinker's guide to the Bible,"It did take me a couple tries to get through this book, but it was worth it. This commentary has everything I looked for. It explained the book in its historical context as well as its spiritual and contemporary importance. Some of the writing is a bit bombastic and difficult to wade through, but I learned a lot from it."
3,Good supplementary resource for study of Romans,"This book wasn't bad. It has some good insights into Romans and some good illustrations. But there's not enough depth here to be a serious student's primary resource. Good to supplement a more serious commentary, though."
1,Wilton Plastic Dowels,"I agree with another reviewer's experience. The dowels arrived curved, it is impossible to cut with a serrated knife or scissors. To make these horrible dowels even usable I had to mark them and ask my husband to cut them on a table saw, trying to use the least curved portion.The quality control at Wilton is slipping, these were not curved during the shipping or packaging they were cut curved."
2,Wilton Plastic Dowel Rods,"This is not at all what I expected. I purchased those to hold a wedding cake in place. From the description, I was under the impression that you could cut the rods down to your exact height. It may be true since I haven't tried but the width was the real issue and way too big to use in my cake. I ended up not touching those and buying some wood ones in a store. I am not sure why you would use those for baking but I wouldn't recommend it. The rods are also hollow and because they are wide, I would think it would get fairly messy."
3,review,I wish I didn't have to write a review for everything; would be nice if I could just click the stars on whether I like it or not and had the option of a comment instead of a requirement
5,Once Is Not Enough,This book was great from start to finish. I recommend this book to anyone who is a fan of Jackie Collins or anyone similar.
3,Not as good as others,"I loved Valley of the Dolls and enjoyed Love Machine. Once is not Enough starts slow. There are spurts of page turning, but it's also really easy to put down and walk away from. Good for the Jacqueline Susann enthusist but for a first time reader I'd recommend the two previously mentioned titles."
5,By far the greatest novel written in English.,"I have been moved, changed, turned upside down by this amazing piece of work. I have seen the light, Jackie! Very few people know that Jackie was really a man! But I do, I knew him well. Way to Jackie, hey-hoo!"
3,has once ever been enough?,"Incest, orgies, rape, UFOs, betrayal, drugs, dark secrets and hidden children. Yes, this book has it all. And it did keep me reading, as did Valley of the Dolls. It is not good literature, but who reads Jackie for good literature? It is a terribly fun read, though. I just picked up The Love Machine and will give it a read probably later this month, if I can hold off that long. I'm only giving it three stars because I feel it could have used some editing, and she could have rearranged some of the story a bit. I don't think the nun rape scene should be so far from the Karla scenes that happen later in the book. For a while I had an odd feeling that that was the end of Karla. Then she came back and all was well again. She could have varied her sentence structure a little, too? But don't let these little quibbles keep you away."
3,WELL....,"Well, at least the cover art here is better than ""I'M IN YOU""... Good debut, solid songwriting. The seeds for FRAMPTON COMES ALIVE started here....."
5,"Save Money, Time & Gas","Why is a car air filter so important? The more air that enters an engine increases combustion activity resulting in more horsepower. An engine with a restricted or plugged air filter is like a person breathing through a straw. Now I installed this `once-in-a-car-lifetime' filter. Let me explain it this way. With most ordinary air filters you buy at the auto store, you pay about $10-$15 and they should be changed every 15,000 miles. This filter will last 50,000 (the box actually says 1,000,000) miles before you change it and even then, you can buy a $14 ""K&N"" kit to clean it yourself! So you're saving yourself about $1,000 and the hassle of changing a filter every 15,000 miles. Guaranteed great quality. Lifetime gaurantee. Check out all of their products."
5,It fits and works well so am happy with it.,Seems like it is better then OEM and can be used over and over again so looks like a good thing.
1,Not as good as their other products!,"I wanted to love these, but I just don't. I am returning them. I wear a size 9 shoe, and these were actually slightly floppy on me. Additionally, the beads in the bottom do not lay flat across your entire foot when you have them on, which kind of defeats the purpose of keeping your feet warm. I took them off and shook them around until the beads were spread out uniformly, but the only way they stay like that is if you then just place your feet on the floor. If you want to prop your feet up, the beads then all shift down again and refuse to stay in place. I love their other products, but the design of this one is off. I'll just stick with my old Gap slipper socks for now."
2,Slippers you can't walk in,"These slippers are beautiful and very nicely packaged. However I did not understand when buying them that you cannot walk in them. I think that's important for someone to know. You remove and heat the soles, then replace them in the bottom of the slippers. It was hard to picture as described."
4,"Smells great, even when not heated","I have used many heat wraps, especially those heated by microwaving... and this one smells great. I got hooked with Dreamtime products when I got a little kit from them that included a candle, spray, etc... but that was a smaller wrap than this one. Also, this wrap has little pockets that keep the grains evenly distributed along its length. Its cover is velvety soft and looks good, too...when left on the bed or couch after use."
5,Great Comfort,"I bought these for my father, who is 84 and has blood circulation problems in his feet. He loves them. A couple of minutes in the microwave, and they are ready to provide him with hours of relief. The only downside is that the Cozys are not designed to walk in, which poses a small issue for Dad. But overall, a great product!"
3,It's ok,"It's capped choline just like the others. I find a busted cap every few bottles, but it's not a major problem."
3,Trouble sleeping on this,"I recently decided to try this product to increase my mental energy and focus. Boy does it do that! The only problem is, the time-release supposedly kicks in 10 hours later. I noticed myself getting a second wind rather late at night and then being awake until 1:00 a.m. If you want to be up to the wee hours of the morning this is great for you. If you have trouble sleeping, I would not recommend this. I still use it some, but I empty out about a third of the capsule before taking it.Update: The last few times I took this I did not feel as jangley as the first time, even taking the full capsule. So maybe your body adjusts to it with regular use. I still don't take it daily, just once in a while for extra energy."
1,The listed product's expiration date may be misleading,"I received the product with an expiration good for another two full years. Upon opening, everything seemed fine and the product works to provide slight benefits to concentration, memory, and recall.However, a few days after opening, the capsules began to crack and become soft, and elicited a terrible odor. It is my understanding that these capsules are intended to break down in the presence of moisture; but I heeded the recommendations and store the container in a cool and dry place. I cannot explain the spontaneous wearing out other than by the lack of quality in the consideration of the capsule's integrity. It is almost humorous to believe that exposure to the air initiated this breakdown. The pitfall of this design? The pill loses its ""two-staged"" claim, works quickly, and wears out in a few short hours.Be aware that as this is a consumable dietary supplement classified as a grocery product, you cannot return it."
1,Fail,"Capsules yellow and half-dissolved, with stronger-stench and powder outside. Obviously old and/or moist. I'm in the midst of finals. CTD is obviously not a dependable merchant."
3,"Depressing, lots of facts, hard to read","This book is only readable for those with lots of patients, very interested in details about gealtacht school children in 1960's or 80's, and with a heart of stone. It is abselutely depressing reading, and leavs no hope for the irish language (as the title implies) in the future. It does have some good chapters about the language politics and sorces for revival. So if you just skip the chapters about the different Gealtacht (or read one), it might prove useful :-)"
3,Beatles Fingerpicking Review,"I must say the fingerpicking of ""Yesterday"" is good and some of the ryhthm progressions for some of the other songs ""Hey Jude"", ""Something"", ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps"",etc. are good, the book doesn't offer more than that. Most of the fingerpicking is drab and more of chord progressions than true fingerpicking style. I'll rate this book at mediocre if you don't have the chord progressions for these songs, want a good fingerstyle of yesterday and get a good low price. Enjoy!"
2,Fingerpicking Beatles by Fred Sokolow,"I agree with some of the other comments. I have no doubt that the arrangements are accurate, and some of the arrangements are rhythmically good, but they are otherwise disappointing. I do occasional solo gigs, and was looking for some good Beatles arrangements. I respect the author for his musical knowledge, but either he is not great at arranging for fingerstyle guitar, or he had some other objective in mind (or I'm just out to lunch)."
4,Worth Hearing,"Gotta admit, if you're a PJ Harvey fan circa IS THIS DESIRE you'll like this. I think I hear a little Patti Smith in there too."
4,Commodity Fetischism,"Are you missing the fact that ""Jack White"" is clean, sober, and just ""broke his finger""? This record is about drugs. So, yeah, they were stumbling around on-stage? Miserable performance? I think that's quite the point. Anyway, if you liked early Royal Trux this will take you back--and if you don't know who the Trux are..."
3,Good if you've never heard Discount before.,If you're a fan of Discount(Allison's old band) this album can be a dissapointment; if not you'll enjoy it.
4,Kills riding in on someone's coat tails... I think not.,"The Kills are an extraordinarily intense band. Alison (VV) and Jamie (Hotel) complement each other well. His guitar playing is catchy and gritty at the same time. Her vocals are passionate and raw. There is absolutely no showmanship in their performances. The track I enjoyed the most was 'Wait', a slower sweeter song. I have always been a sucker for Alison's softer singing even back in the days of her pop punk band Discount. She has a truly amazing voice. With the surge in the popularity of rock and blues music it would be easy to group these two with some of the more widely known musicians making headlines, but they truly deserve a place of their own. The music is honest, chaotic, sexy and above all artistic. It's Brit meets America and it will blow you away."
1,This is (bad) simply put,"1 star is my reveiw, why? Because i could record better tunes by (...) up to a tape recorder and putting a drum machine over it. Seeing them live is like stand up comedy, 100% laughable, worst proformance I have ever seen in my life. Thank god someone unplugged their drum machine by accident, otherwise i would of had to end my life there. The band is this, one man that wants to play guitar like Jack White, and one woman who is drunk and stubbles around stage. Gee, that hasn't been done before, thank you Patti Smith."
4,Gritty Low Down Ultracool,"I also found this band by way of Dead Weather, but The Kills are actually much much better. Stripped down dirty blues rock."
3,Wow what a disappointment,"After ""Midnight Boom,"" I thought the Kills were onto something entirely new and unique, expanding horizons and creating some great music. So I checked this one out (didn't realize at first that this was their debut re-released--thanks for letting me know). To me it sounds very rushed, and is not enjoyable save some cool guitar licks (hence the 3-stars). I do NOT like the singer's diva voice, which was mostly absent on Midnight Boom, thankfully. All of the songs follow a Black Crows-meet-White Stripes feel, and bore the heck out of me. I want some more ""Last Days of Magic,"" ""Sour Cherry"" kind of gems, but sadly that sound is completely absent here. Oh well, hopefully their next effort will continue the amazing sound they've been developing"
4,Sweet tales from another era,"Despite its subject matter, there's little in the way of hagiography here-- these saints tales are more sweet than religious. Taking their cue from the classic story of St. Francis of Assisi and the Wolf of Gubbio, the book's short stories (mostly short enough to be bedtime stories for young children) focus more on the saints' love for, and personal relationships with, individual animals, who all have names and personalities. This is a book that may be enjoyed by an adult, looking back to a long-gone era when children's books were not yet edgy or slapstick, but sweet and with a gentle moral... in this case, be kind to animals (which hardly seems oppressively 'teachy'!), but may equally be a a collection of fine bedtime stories to read to the two to three year old. Recommended, either for parenting or nostalgia.FCZ+The Book of Saints and Friendly Beasts"
2,book review,"too short and did not like, would not recommend, try another book from free library, too short too many words here to write"
5,"""Do it yourself"" spirit at his best","What a delicious ""melting pop band""! These guys have some of the best musical influences... from the primary sounds of ""Young Marble Giants"" to the sweetest noise atmospheres of ""Yo La Tengo""... always keeping simplicity as rule number one! However, in spite of the ""8 Track Sound System"" seems like a domestic release, the quality is absolutely great and controlled, sometimes dressing a distorted low-fi style, others producing crystalline sounds of toy instruments. We can hear voices, bells, clapping hands, drinking glasses, birdsong, hair dryers, lighters, spinning tops, skipping panda bears, rulers, hammers, televisions, turntable scratching, all captivated with a singular PZM microphone (invented by themselves, I suppose). The final result is an exciting and very creative record! This is the kind of record that inspires ""music addicts"" to start or to improve to make good stuff... and something really new!"
4,Very good anime worth the money,"This is a very good anime series. I can't quite put my finger on why I like it, I just do. The characters are very well created and the interactions are realistic. It's hard to classify: it's not action/adventure although there are some components, it's not romance, although again there are some components. I guess it has a little bit of everything which makes it a relative good reflection of real life. Once it gets into the meat of the story and the background mysteries that tie all the characters together you are drawn in. I'm not much a fan of the 50+ episode animes. Most (but not all) just can't hold my interest beacuse there is so much boring filler material thrown in. Which makes this perfect for me 13 episodes (plus 2 one off episodes) let's you get into the story and get to a satisfying conclusion in a relatively short period of time."
5,He's the Man.,"Willie Nelson is a man's man, and took some getting used to for me, but now I am a huge fan."
1,A waste of money,"I've had a love affair with countertop convection ovens since I discovered them in the 80's. The Faberware lasted for years. They were so impressive that I gave them to friends and family. I can't find this brand anymore so I guess they are no longer available. I hoped this would be an adequate substite. Not even close!This oven is not usable unless you want to smoke up your whole house and set off smoke alarms. I thought this was just a problem because of the newness of the oven but not so. The problem has presisted, causing me to stop using and look for another oven."
1,Godzilla,"We never even plugged this sucker in. I wanted a countertop convection oven that would accomodate a pizza or 9 x 13 pan, and this unit was supposed to do that. What none of the product decscriptions mentioned is that this ""countertop"" unit should NOT be used underneath a cupboard. Don't most kitchen countertops have a cupboard over them? Also not mentioned is that the unit required a 4"" clearance on the sides: so whatever the dimensions of the unit are, you need to add 8"". I'm sending this monster back and getting something smaller."
3,minor flaw,"great machint,,except for one thing..The door seal quickly fails and the replacement is a real cheap one that is almost impossible to make work right.. Ended up using high temp adhesive to adhere it to the door... but they sent me one free... it is definately the weak link in the chain.. The achine itself ,tho, is absolutely a great Wareing product..."
4,"Great Fun, Light-Hearted Reading","These funny, light stories by P.G. Wodehouse are a must-read for any fans of him or British humor in general. This collection is the first of many featuring Bertie Wooster, a none-too-bright English gent, and his ingenius butler Jeeves, who is constantly thinking of schemes to get Bertie and his friends out of trouble. The Jeeves stories are a great place to start for anyone interested in Wodehouse's funny work. Though the stories are sometimes a bit long and may drag a little, they are still charming, charming tales. Delicious reading."
5,"Precursor to Seinfeld? At Any Rate, Very Funny","To put it succinctly, these stories are hilarious and a joy to read. All of them are somewhere between good to great, but my favorites were Jeeves Takes Charge, Jeeves And The Unbidden Guest, The Rummy Affair Of Old Biffy, Without The Option, and Bertie Changes His Mind. The plotting is always tight and funny (in a situational comedy kind of way), and then Wodehouse's command of the language and his subtle turns of phrase throughout the book make it enjoyable on multiple levels. Sort of reminds me of Seinfeld, if Seinfeld had lived in pre-World War II England with a super-intelligent butler. Highly recommended."
4,MORE OF JOHN STAMOS KISSING ANOTHER GUY!PLEASE!,"I am an afficiando of movies of the ""gay"" genre, & I really was suprised to see ""eye candy"" John Stamos play this role with complete ""comfort"" as a gay man. Alas, there was only one tiny kiss with his partner in this movie, but all the same it was an exteremely enjoyable film. The entire cast played their respective roles so well. It was filmed in a beautiful setting, by a lake, & James Brolin( Yeah, more ""eye candy"") plays the senator who's daughter is affianced to Mr. Stamos's brother . Well played, well written & very entertaining."
4,Must see,"I was wonderfully surprised at the quality and composition of this story. Wedding Wars takes a light hearted comedic approach to an all too controversial but relevant issue in today's society, the right for gay people to marry. Very engaging and entertaining, the producers explain in the brief extras feature that the story is basically a fable, a true to life story with some implausible elements meant to carry a message of importance. I never found the movie preachy and I loved the way all the main characters were presented, no major villains here, just real humans with some differences in their beliefs. Though some may object to the lack of resolution of the issues at stake, the story does resolve the wedding at hand, kindly and gently, and leaves the audience with perhaps some new insights to reflect upon."
4,needs help,"This book needs some help. I am a big Family Fun Fan, and take the mag. and have all their books and was so excited to find that they had finally put a travel book together.I loved the begining part about ways to travel with kids, all their tips and side notes. I liked that I could find kid friendly hotels and resturaunts.But I was so dissapointed that alot of the states that I would be traveling in the book only talked about a few areas in that state. California should of had been one book and talked about northern and southern Calif., not just a few citties.Family Fun has always had out of the way and unusal places to travel in their mag. why didn't they do this for their travel book.If you are looking to see places all over the southwest in this book, you might be dissapointed like me."
5,Got to love Goofy,Classic Goofy cartoons. Who doesn't love them? Hard to find but well worth looking for. I can't wait for volume 4.
3,Goofy's best shorts,"Definitely a good collection to get if you haven't seen a Goofy short. Includes some of his best, the ""How to"" series. All the shorts in this collection are also on the Walt Disney Treasures ""The Complete Goofy"" set, so don't purchase this if you already have that."
5,Wonderful. Light and crispy.,These meringues are very very light and crispy. The best way I can describe these is imagine taking the meringue off of a pie and baking it until it is crisp... these meringues are just as light and airy but a bit sweeter than the meringue from the top of a pie.I highly recommend these.
1,Arrived broken,The mirror was unglued from the backing when I took it out of the package. I glued it together with Liquid Nails. It held nicely but was messy. The mirror fell from the tiled shower wall and broke in less than 24 hours from when I installed it. I can now see my many shower mirror are plastic. This mirror is too heavy to to be held by the suction cups and glass is dangerous in the shower as it will certainly shatter.
2,Disappointed,"Good price and arrived quickly, like most Amazon orders. However, the product looks like it has been used and repaired before, with moisture behind the mirror and scuffing along the frame. It is way too heavy to hold up during a makeup application, too large to store easily, and I'm afraid to just stick it to the main mirror after reading the comments about shattered glass in the bathroom. It also distorts around the edges, unlike the 6"" mirror that I was trying to replace.All in all, a disappointment that's probably too much trouble/expense to return."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS DANGEROUS MIRROR,"Immediately after installing the Jerdon First Class 5X Suction Mirror to the tiled wall of my bath, the glass mirror fell out of the plastic housing and shattered in my bathtub. Luckily, I was not seriously injured, but the impact caused a very deep and wide cut on the surface of the tub. I am waiting to hear back from Jerdon Products as to how they plan to remedy my situation."
3,when delivered intact it is good,I have purchased this mirror several times. All my older relatives love it to shave with etc etc.My BIG complaint is that most of the time it is not delivered intact. Amazon has reshipped them to me at no cost but please Amazon start shipping them in bigger boxes and with more bubble wrap around them! This latest replacement was also broken! The box was shipped USPS and the box was covered with grease as well! Yuck! The grease had seeped into the inside of the box. AND no big surprise the items were damaged. One had a fracture on the inside glass and the acrylic frame was damaged too. The other mirror (glass part) popped out of the acrylic frame. I called amazon and they refunded my money and told me to order them again. This is annoying and I'm not sure I want to risk it.
1,distorted image,Having left a mirror that I loved in a hotel I've been searching for another. I like that this mirror is big and that it has 3 suction cups so it doesn't flop down like another I tried but the image is distorted. I thought maybe I had selected the wrong magnification so I went to a local store to try out different magnifications to see what I needed and the 5x does the trick. Evidently it's just a problem with the mirror.
3,Mirror,"This mirror seems to produce somewhat of a distortion when not in the exact position of being centered and right on top of it when looking into it. The size is excellent, and allows for a ""whole face"" view, if you get close enough!"
3,ok for the price but watch out for the unglued defect,"This is ok for the price, but we use it as a hand-held mirror, for which purpose it works fine. Like other customers, I found that the mirror was unglued from the frame when the product arrived. It's easy enough to fix that. I tested the suction cups on our bathroom mirror, and they seem to work fine, but we decided not to take a chance and only use it as a hand-held mirror."
1,"Jersen JSC5 9"" mirror - VERY POOR QUALITY","One look into this 5X magnification bathroom mirror told me how poor its quality is. The wavy image of my face looking back reminded me of a funhouse mirror. Price-wise, this is a very cheap mirror, especially for its large size, but the cheapness of its glass makes it a very poor purchase, indeed."
1,You must pay to keep your existing phone number with this plan,Amazon does not allow you to port the number from an existing cell phone to this cell phone unless you pay them $250.00 when you buy Cingular service. Cingular will happily transfer your existing number to a new phone for free if you buy a cell phone from them. I would advise anybody with an existing number to buy a phone from Cingular or another retailer and not Amazon.
2,Don't buy this if you want to use the clip,"Lovely leather in a comfortable case. Too bad the clip design is so bad. My original lasted 3 weeks. I bought a replacement and it lasted just 2 (and the clip broke in 2 different places!). Now I carry the case around in my pocket.If anyone has a suggestion for a holster that actually works (and puts the Blackberry to sleep), I'd love to hear it."
1,The design needs to be changed to make the clip attachment to the holster sturder,We have replaced many of these holsters because the clip breaks off from the holster. A larger metal (not plastic) connector should be used.
1,useless,This case is good for one thing and that is breaking. This was my third case and on all 3 the clip broke with a month or two of use. Don't waste your money or your time.
2,My Clip Broke Too,"Like a couple of the previous reviewers, the clip on my original case broke within a month or two of normal use too. Luckily I was sitting on the train when it snapped rather than walking down the street, so no damage was done to the BlackBerry.The case works fine otherwise, but now it's carried in my coat pocket or in my messenger bag. I wouldn't buy another one of this design now that I see that the clip seems to be a common weakness."
1,I've just broken my second one in a week,"How is this holster rating an average of four stars? I would give it zero if possible. My first one lasted about two months before the clip broke off, the second one lasted ONE WEEK! Using a thin plastic post to hold the clip on is a very poor design, and not what I would expect from Blackberry."
1,BlackBerry 8800 Leather Holster Review,You would think I had learned my leason by now. This is the third holster I've purchased and all met the same fate. Poor construction and flimsy design caused each to crack at the belt clip rendering this product useless.
3,Clip breaks,"This is my third one. The clip broke on the first 2. But at this price, I will just keep replacing them."
1,clip broke within days,The pin that hold the clip on is extremely weak. I barely bumped the holster against something and the clip broke off. There is a small amount of glue holding the pin together. Find a better clip.
3,Works OK,I keep breaking the belt clip. Maybe not the fault of the clip but maybe they should make them stronger
3,Blackberry Holster nice but a little smaller than the original,"It is basically a perfect replica of the original but the magnetic flap doesn't clasp on as tightly as the original. However, it does hold tight enough and for like a quarter of the cost, it's a great deal!"
5,Great Holster,"I had lost my original holster, and bought this one to replace it, and its fabulous with a decent price."
3,Blackberry cases,Althought these are advertised as being original products they do appear to possibly be seconds in that the actual phone pocket size was different between the 2 that I purchased. One always locks the phone or will connect you to the internet and the other one is fine.
5,Best Buy,I've just received my order for this from Amazon and its really good. The auto shut-off of phone feature when the phone is inserted works as the Original and is extremely user friendly. Highly recommend this item.
1,Clip Breaks Too Easily...,"I ended up going through three of these holsters before I gave up and started carrying my Blackberry in my pocket (before I switched to my Android). The problem I kept having was that the clip would break off. Each time it broke off clean at the rotating joint. This was very troubling because the phone would just quietly fall off my hip and land on the floor. If I had been in a busy or loud location, the phone would have been most likely lost.I have to add that I do not abuse these. Actually, I work in an office and wear a suit all day so there really is no physical labor or stress on this holster. It simply fails after a couple of months of use. After my experience, I would not trust my phone and all the information on it with this holster.Overall, this is a great idea that is poorly designed and manufactured.-Cheers"
5,Delivered as described and on time. Thank you.,"Got a great deal on 2 blackberry holsters, and they were delivered on time and in excellent condition."
4,Great item at a great price,"I lost my original holster that came with my Blackberry, so when I looked for a replacement I was shocked at the cost. Thirty bucks at every retail outlet I went to... yikes. Amazon's price blows everyone else away.It's a good product, even if it isn't flashy."
3,TALKING KEY CHAIN,"I WORKS WELL BUT CHEAPLY MADE. SETTING BUTTONS ON BACK REQUIRE A PENCIL TO CONNECT TO MAKE CHANGES.IF YOU CHANGE THE BATTERIES, THE BACK IS SCREWED ON WITH TINY SCREWS AND ARE DIFFICULT TO GET OFF AND THE PLASTIC THE SCREWS GO INTO STRIPS EASILY. BEST TO JST BUTY A NEW ONE WHEN THE BATTERIES WEAR OUT AS THEY ARE AS EXPENSIVE AS THE WHOLE PRODUCT!!"
3,its ok,In terms of shooting and accuracy this gun is awesome but i was in a intence war yesterday and the stock broke off
4,Used in 2005 Ford Focus ZX4,I found the sides to be tight in a Ford Focus I installed it in. Even with the sides screwed down I had to push them in so it would fit in the stereo bay otherwise it would get stuck. I used this with a double din JVC stereo.
1,Dont buy,"Its total crap.They sent me two left brackets and no right brackets.Of course, my truck was torn apart when I discovered this."
1,Did not fit...,"This Scosche double DIN fit kit did not fit the Pioneer 2300DVD unit. The kit was too large for a nice, flush, tight fit around the unit face. I purchased a Scosche fit kit from Walmart that had a couple different fit kits, a pocket if you were going to install a single DIN unit, and a rear brace to attach to the back of the deck. I selected the pieces that worked and was able to have a great install...Only a few more dollars too!"
2,"Poor fit, cannot reccomend","I didn't want to give it one star because it DOES work, and it seems like one star should be reserved for something that's completely useless...but it's not much better than that.The weird 3 piece design was difficult to install (takes about 4 hands), having to break off extra plastic tabs is just sad, but the worst is it just fits poorly. The face angle is wrong, so the bottom edge is flush to the dash, but the top is recessed about 1/4"". Then there's a 1/8"" gap between the faceplate and the dash all the way around, and the same 1/8"" all the way around the inside between it and the stereo. I can actually see the mounting screws through the gap.can't recommend this product at all. I'm going to remove it and throw it away once the replacement arrives."
3,A little modification required for 2007 F150 FX2,Product was perfect fit for my clarion cx501. Had to completely cut off back tabs for it to sit where it was supposed to. Afterwards fit great and flush! Radio looks great and I'm pleased.
1,"Terrible fit, had to buy a Metra kit to finish job!!!!","These ""kits"" are becoming so cheaply made. The plastic parts are fragile and the opening was too tight to accommodate my Pioneer AVH-P3300BT which I also bought from Amazon. Seems like these companies woul put a bit more emphasis on quality and design. DO NOT BUY SCOSCHE PRODUCTS FOR DOUBLE DIN."
1,Not the way to go,"I attempted to install my new DVD player this weekend. All was going well until I opened up this kit. I knew from previous reviews that it wouln't quite fit my head unit (trimming required). But this adapter doesn't even properly fit the dash - leaves big gaps around it.BUT... much worse than that is the design. The original unit is supported in the front by thick, metal brackets and the rear is supported by a rubber-wrapped metal plug that fits into a slot. This unit expects to support the whole head unit by a couple of thin, plastic tabs on the front only. Even if it had fit properly, I wouldn't have used it. The first bump or off-road trip would have snapped the thing right off."
2,Not what i wanted,"bought this for a 06 F150 to install a double 7"" Radio. it did not fit. the face plate is too small. Others say cut the opening to allow room. But, that's why you are buying the kit in the first place, to limit fabrications. Looking for another brand."
3,Don't like assembly,Does the job . I do not like the way the side brackets fit into theFront frame . Had to shave off some of front frame to it would fit .
2,Not so good,"If installing a double din stereo in a 2006 Ford Focus, don't use this mounting kit. I tried this one first, then bought the Metra 95-5812 and it worked much better. This one stuck about 1/2"" out of my dash whereas the Metra one fits flush. Also, on this mounting kit, you have to break off various plastic tabs to get it to work and, as hard as I tried, I couldn't get it centered in my dash. The Metra one worked so much better."
4,Magisterial work for its time (1964),"For anyone grappling academically with sexual ethics Thielicke is a must buy. It first appeared in English in 1964, the Guardian said ""The book is a rare combination: insight, pastoral wisdom, and knowledge of the work of experts in the fields with which it deals... This is, in fact, the best Christian treatment of this theme which has appeared for a long time."" He deals with homosexuality on p 269-292, he was also influenced by D S Bailey in the UK (1955). It is probably the equivalent to Richard HaysThe Moral Vision of the New Testament: Community, Cross, New Creation, A Contemporary Introduction to New Testament Ethicsnow.For a link to one of Thielickes other pastoral books see hereA Little Exercise for Young Theologians"
2,Nothing new.,Just a rehash of old material. No real concentration on the abs. I don't think it sold very well back when it was new so I didn't really expect much.
1,Where's the Playlist?,"In my perfect world, I would have found a playlist for this item which had it been available, may have provided sufficient information on which to base a purchasing decision. Without it... I just post this review (?) and *again* leave Amazon's site to visit a local merchant."
2,Don't waste your money,"The movie is not bad, it's this particular production by Passion that sucks. So cheap!"
1,Did not stand the test of time,"I bought this watch for my sister and she has been using it for about a year. I've had to reset the time and then re-synchronize the voice at least 4 times. Also, my sister is cognitively limited and the watch has way too many buttons that can be pushed by accident. When she bends her wrist up it pushes the buttons. I'd like to replace it but don't see a better option as of yet."
3,induce vomitting when?,"I enjoyed the entire section on the Shih tzu, but would have liked to read more about only the Shih tzu. For general dog information, I can get other books.This however was the only book I have found that has an extensive list on poisons for dogs, especially in people food. There is one section on when to induce vomiting, and there is (I believe) a huge typo. It says to induce vomiting when the dog has eaten something sharp and something else. I think it should say ""DO NOT induce vomiting.!In the list of poisons, it would be interesting to see what the side effects are. Ex. Onions cause autoimmune something anemia."
4,My Shih Tzu ate this book,What is it about shih tzus & eating paper? I do not have 7 more words to say about this.
4,a very informative little book,"The book was very informative and easy to read. I would recommend this book to current and future shih tzu owners. The only drawback of the book is that there were some topics which I think are essential for every shih tzu owner to know, that were not explained in detail in this book. Jo Anne White proves though, that she is an authority in shih tzu knowledge and care."
2,Aims low and hits its target,"This straight-to-video's modest budget is attested to by the fact that while most of the action is supposed to take place at a large state prison, this prison only seems to house about 12 inmates. The plot is that old but reliable one about a man posing as a prisoner so he can go ""undercover"" and solve a crime. The crime in this case is not especially interesting and it's resolved in much too pat a fashion. However, leading man Tommy Lee Thomas looks good with his shirt off, (though he seems too small to be throwing his weight around), and there's a torture scene, (modeled on the one in ""Lethal Weapon""), in which he's hanged by his wrists and zapped with electric shocks. Mr. Thomas' performance may not be of Oscar caliber but he does know how to yell."
1,Absolutely awful!,I will admit I purchased this DVD because I was in a hurry and thought it said Tommy Lee Jones. My mistake but I watched it anyway. There is NOTHING good about this movie. The acting is terrible. Local theater groups would have better actors than these folks. The guns sounded like pop guns and the lead character was just not believable. Since the star also produced it and wrote it...no wonder he had the lead. I'll bet the other guys were all relatives. Can't imagine finding that many bad actors for one movie.
1,Unbelievable crap!,"This movie could've been something, had they gotten some real actors, a script and a director. Well, they didn't, and this movie is an embarassment to mankind."
3,Worth a look...,"Although low budget, the action and humor keep one entertained. Up and coming star, Tommy Lee Thomas, reminds one of a young Clint Eastwood. Overall a dark comedy with moral undertones."
5,"The ""Executive Producer's"" Thoughts","This is a really great prison film that truly shows what really goes on inside those dark prison walls across the US. The casting and storyline made the film. We were lucky to recruit incredible Eric Roberts,Martin Cove,Matthew Ansara and introducing our Producer, Tommy Lee Thomas who stars and of course, moi as ""Jeanette"" co-starring with Eric Roberts who plays Officer Hopkins. Definitely rent, buy and let it sweep you off into the world of action and intrigue............"
2,Doesn't do better than the original,"While as entertaining as any ""Romance"" novel, Sarah becomes a ""modern woman"" in this fictionalized account of the story of Sarah and Abraham. If you like Romance Novels, you will like this adventure packed, sexually broad novel. In this version, however, the story of Sarah is pointless."
2,Sarah: A Novel,"Barbara Cartland writes The Red Tent. I would put this book in the romantic fiction genre rather than literary. The author attempts to wrap a bodice-ripper in the robes of the Bible in order to ride coat-tails of better written creative fiction based on Biblical characters. Use of sexual words are gratuitous and, even worse, fail at being stimulating. It's a nice story but not gripping. I loved The Red Tent, but did not finish this book."
2,Prurient Tale Takes Sacred into Profane,"I found it distracting to be reading such an extrapolated story based on biblical characters. If I had read this story thinking of it only as fiction, it would have been better than reconciling this book with the known work in Genesis. The writing was choppy and knowing how much the author had to fill in, I just could not enjoy it as biblical fiction.I also felt that the more prurient parts of the tale turned the sacred into the profane or secular. I didn't take anything away from this book other than some knowledge of the culture in Ur (and some irritation!)."
2,Happy to reach the end...,"I am normally a fan of the Biblical Fiction books such as The Red Tent and The Queenmaker but Sarah did not live up to my expectations. Unlike the two books I previously mentioned, Marek Halters writing in Sarah was very choppy which made the story hard to follow. He would skip years at a time between major events in her life, which left me confused and wondering what happened to get us from point A to point B. There are so many good Biblical Fiction books out there, don't waste your time on this one."
2,"Not accurate, clouds over true story","I find books like ""Sarah"" to be disappointing. When you finish it, you put it down thinking, ""That did not enlighten me at all about the true story."" The story of Sarah and Abraham is very true yet Halter's version left much to be desired. The author took way too much liberty with the story. For example, until she meets Abram, Sarai is a priestess of a pagan nation. While the possibility of this is present, it's a story-line plot that is highly unbelievable. I hope no one reading this takes it for fact.Quite adult nature in content. In some places its a page turner, but I wouldn't recommend anyone read this book. It's truely fiction and overall probably a waste of time."
1,The Book Was Not For Me,I did not care for the way the author took liberty with the character Sarah.
4,Sarah,"It is an excellent book to read, but the actual physical book is poor in condition. The front cover inside is showing the bindings and the front and back cover just show grey cardboard not a very finished product. The read is/was excellent I would recommend it highly"
1,Just was not interesting,I was so disappointed by this book. I read a review somewhere that said if you liked the Red Tent you will love Sarah. I cannot disagree more. The book was just flat. The characters were not well developed and the plot dragged. There was so much made of Sarah's beauty it was daunting to get through the chapters. I would not recommend this book to anyone.
3,"Good Story, Bad Translation...","The story was good, but I think the English translation leaves much to be desired. The wording is very simple at times, and the descriptions are just not that imaginative. I found some glaring typos in the paperback edition. Furthermore, (I'm nit-picking a little, I know) ""the small of her back"" was way overused, and the phrase has lost all of its romantic power for me now.Like I said, the story was good, but I was expecting (as mentioned on the cover) that this book would be similar to the Red Tent (which I loved). Plain and simple: There are similarities between the two books, but Sarah doesn't have the same language and descriptions."
2,Just O.K.,"While I do agree with the fellow reviewer who found this book hard to finish, I feel as though I should point out one thing. It is fiction written for fictions sake. I highly enjoyed The Red Tent but found The Gilded Chamber boring. With Sarah I just didn't enjoy the writing style. Fiction should be for story telling, if you want fact go for a biblical studies book. Personaly I just want a well told tale, but did not find it in this book. Seemed choppy and hard to follow."
3,"Good story, not Biblically accurate","While I enjoyed this book as a love story, it was not the Biblically accurate version I wanted. The writer takes lots of license in his story line, incorporating Biblical history only enough to make it relevant. A lot of Sarah's background is assumed-which is expected somewhat because the Bible does not spell out a lot-but key facts are left out..such as the fact the the Bible says Sarah and Abram were half-siblings.It's an easy read, containing more sexuality than might be desired, but it keeps your attention. Book one of a trilogy. I hope the other two have more facts in them."
4,Historical,This was a great woman perspective. I was amazed to find out that the author was a man. I really enjoyed Sarah's version.
2,"Terrible, read The Red Tent if you want a biblical tale about women.","The beginning of this story was very choppy and had no flow. Finally, there was some fluidity of plot but then it stopped being interesting. Having read the story of Sarah before, I'm surprised by the author's choice to omit certain parts.Don't bother. You aren't missing anything and you'll feel like you wasted your money. I couldn't even finish the last 50 pages, I was so bored."
2,Sarah,"I read this book as a book club selection, and that's the only reason I bothered to finish it. This seems to be a ""woman's book"" written by a male author, and though that doesn't make it unique, in this book, I thought the author included many unnecessary, gratuitous details. The book was supposed to have been based on an Old Testament Bible story, and I have my doubts that the author stayed true to the Bible, either."
2,Choose another hockey game instead,"As much as I wanted to really like this game, I just can't. Although we own NHL Hitz and NHL 2004, the primary reason we bought this game is because it allows you to create a player and, with the Eye Toy camera for PlayStation 2, put your very own face on it. That's the idea, anyway. In reality the player looked no more like my son or me than did any of the actual HNL players built into the game. So, in the end it is a feature with no actual benefit. Maybe that's because of poor product design or maybe it's the result of the limitations of the camera, but either way the game is not worth buying because the hockey action is so far behind the competing games. The graphics pale in comparison to either of the other games I mentioned, and the gameplay itself just isn't as fun or as realistic. Gretzky 2005 sounds great, but unfortunately isn't."
1,Get a clue,"For the other two reviews prior to mine.... There was NO 2004!! This used to be NHL Faceoff put out by 989 sports... they didnt make an edition last year, because says were horrible in previous years. If you want a high priced game thats not worth the money...buy this one. If you want to get your money's worth stick with EA or ESPN NHL. But good luck 989, but it has been how many years since Wayne took the ice? Look for OJ Simpson football next fall...."
3,A Hero Aint Nothin But a Sandwich,"i just read this book for the first time and i did not really like it. it is about a 13 yeal old named Benji who is addictied to heroin and under alot of stress. He can stop anytime he wants to but he doesnt.the language in this book is also very hard to understand. THere are big words, and phrases can be confusing. This book is ment for people who can really comprehend and understand the way it was written."
4,A Hero Ain't Nothin' but a Sandwich,"13-year-old Benjie from Harlem has a lot of difficulties in his life. He mad many bad choices by choosing to take drugs. He got addicted to heroin and smoking after Kenny and Tiger let him try a bit. Soon his teachers and principle found out about him and had a talk. He's so stubborn that he keeps on denying that he don't get hooked on drugs. After all, he quits drugs because his stepfather saved him. If you are young and want to read this book, I warn you that at first it'll be quite difficult to understand the language in the book, after a while you'll get use to it."
3,book review by APL,"~A hero ain~{!/~}t nothing but a sandwich is a great book. I was published in 1973 and it was written by Alice Childress. It was a great book back then, but now there is just a lot of better books. To me it is a boring book, because it mostly the people in the chapter talk about themselves, and some other people that they know. I don~{!/~}t really see anything that has to do with hero or heroin, mostly different people talking about their selves. The book is about Benjie, but I see only a few~~ chapters that he is talking, and some other chapters is about his friend, mom, dad, teacher, and grandma, and some other people.I think the author wrote this book to tell how the family members feel about their kids when they turn 13, because a lot of kids change when they are 13.~"
2,my book,"The book I read was called A hero ani¡t nothing but a sandwich.To me this book was bad. Why I didn¡t like this book is because I was not into the book. Because every time I read it I would do something else, but not read this book in class. What I got out of this book was that if you are young and you take care of your family, that means that you work at a young age under a lot of stress and the last thing you need to do is take drugs. WhyI recommend this book to people is if they want to read something sad. It was a bad book too me. Why did the author write this book? I think because at that time drugs were every were. I think He \She wrote this to people that drugs are bad for and that could mess up your life."
1,Review by:Rob Turner,"A HERO AIN¡T NOTHING BUT A SANDWICHThis book is about a kid with a messed up life and is not trying to make it better. He is a crack head and he does not go to school he thinks it is a waste of time. His family is no help, they don¡t encourage him to at least go to school and stay off the streets so maybe he wont be involved with drugs. And if he goes to school maybe the teachers or the counselors can help him.I think the author wrote the book because he wanted to let you know 0don¡t take things for granted and everybody doesn¡t get lunch money and everybody doesn¡t have parents to help them out.I don¡t like this book because the language is confusing. You can hardly understand what there talking about. If the language was better I probably would have liked the book."
5,A powerful punch,"Powerfully and courageously honest about the lives of the young, African-American heroin addict Benjie and those around him ... There are no easy answers in this book. I think it's a story people need to hear, whether we want to or not. I couldn't put it down; I will never forget it; I only hope I learned from it. Moving and amazing."
2,Too Much Information,"This book started off great with an intriquing prison break and a demented vengeful James Bond type villian but veered off course quickly. The characters were uninteresting except for the ex-spy. The dialogue had the same voice. The prose was bland and the flow of the book was halted by arcane details. It seemed like a poor imitation of a Michael Critchon or Ludlum book - they were the masters at intreweaving facts and details with the story. The story was totally predictable and the major twist with the lead FBI character was hacky and unoriginal. The only fun part was that the book was written in 1996 and technology has changed so much since then. People talking about pagers, CD-Roms and Walkmans and a computer being so advanced because it has one whole gigabyte of memory was kind of funny."
2,Very Disappointing,Don't be fooled by Kindle publishing date. This book was written in 1996 and not nearly as good as the more recent novels by Joseph Finder.
4,Finder's impressive pedigree helps create an impressive novel.,"Finder has a background in Government and Business that helps make this exciting thriller seem all the more plausible. It is also very interesting to read a novel about blowing up a building in New York that was written pre 9/11. At one point he writes that the only thing that could bring down the towers would be a nuke. Would that were only true. He creates a wonderful villian in Henrik Baumann, and keeps this novel a page turner. Not as good as the best Follett or DeMille, so I did not award this strong tome 5 stars. Nevertheless it is a highly recommended read."
2,Cliche single mother heroine & bad guy,"This author could have worked harder at personalizing the villian. The book needed more context, which could have been provided by the author since he'd spend much of his youth in the middle East."
3,"Good Story, But Too Much Info","Storyline was OK, but too much information. I have read almost everything written by Joseph Finder and have thoroughly enjoyed all of his books except this one. This one gave too much detail regarding other terrorists acts and info regarding bombs, etc. Look forward to more books by Joseph Finder and hopefully they will be more to the point and not so wordy."
4,Great Thriller,"After one of FBI Special Agent Sarah Cahill's informants was found dead, Cahill feels obligated to solve her murder. Collected evidence leads into a even bigger case--a case that could affect the world's financial stability. Cahill is placed in charge of a special investigation to stop this threat.Joseph Finder wrote a true thrillride with The Zero Hour--great characters, solid story and once it's over, you wish there was more.Lost HoursThe Friday House"
4,Bam,"I work offshore in the Gulf of Mexico and am constantly trying to forget the rigors of the day by escaping into a good book and ""The Zero Hour"" was definatelly able to remove me from the risks of the day and and plant me into another time and place amidst someone elses woes. I was amazed at the backgroud information that Joseph Finder had to do to get, which I thought, was highly sensitive ideals, operations and inner-workings of our government's superspook entities. I was constantly thinking that Mr. Finder was on the edge of divulging sensitive information about building explosive devises, other terrorist tools and subjecting his self to government sensorship. Thanks for stretching the Constitutional amendments to the limit. A fine read with a tasteful touch with regards to details."
1,A VERY BAD BOOK,"I have previously read Finder's 'Moscow Club' and was looking forward for a good ride. Man, was I disapointed! The plot in itself is okay, but some of the coinsedenses are impossible( The only thorough custom officer chose one of a 1000 containers, in which she checked one item, which happened to contain a detonator, sent to the villain... riiight). If the action was good and logical I could give this one 3 stars, but a novel like this from the author of 'Moscow Club'...sad...very sad.Skip it."
5,A sure fire winner,"I sometimes wish that Joeseph Finder was a more prolific author as I enjoy his writing so much. This is the best of the three I have read and the others are very good also. This book is difficult to put down and when you do you start wondering, ""This could really happen"". So you can't sleep, pick the book up again and keep going. I recommend it to anyone who asks: ""Got a recommendation for a good book?""...and I recommend it to all who read this."
2,"Look good, but fall apart","These look good in my kitchen and put out nice under cabinet light, but after 3 years they completely fell apart with the plastic pieces breaking all over and I had to replace them all. Ironically I replaced them with the same exact product, and thus this purchase and review. If you install these, make sure you run the wires so they are easy to snap together new ones when they need to be replaced."
1,No Go!,"As soon as I opened the package, I knew these were going back. They were made of plastic and as such, the ""nickel"" finish was a joke. In all fairness, I did not install them, therefore do not know how well they perform. However, fron an aesthetic point of view, there are better products in the same price range."
2,Very disappointed,the stitching int he fingers is so slim that my boys cannot get their fingers in them. And my boys have slender fingers . They seem like nice gloves but the fingers are a real problem. I put a pencil up inside both pairs (two different sizes) and the pencil had a tight fit on the small and only slightly better on the medium.
3,Was hoping for more,"Ugh.... I don't know why I bother with Straub. He's got such great ideas, but his books are so frustrating.It's a great story (if a bit odd at times), but put together rather oddly. And as usual with him, it just feels like you have to fight the book in order to be able to understand what's going and to figure out what he's trying to say. I couldn't wait to finish it so I could finally put the thing down and move on. The sad part is that I actually did care what was going on and in the characters. It was just hard to read."
2,"Long read, not worth it","This book was recommended in a news article as one of the top 10 scary stories written. I really question that review. I never felt drama or fear. I never connected with this story. To me, this was a long story where the author tried to impress the reader by weaveng creative, colorful fantasy fairytails in a ""horror"" story. Not worth the read."
2,Shadowland the place we go to when books stink,"I have read some Peter Straub books that I absolutely love, like, for instance, Ghost Story. Then there is this book. The magic of this book is that when it is over, you still have no idea what is going on. That is truly magical. I thought the characters in this book were weak and the story moved along at the pace of a retired snail on holiday. There are much better books out there. I think I will be haunted by the horror of how bad this book was forever."
1,"A Disconnected, Cumbersome Book,",This is one of the most poorly organized books I have read in a long time. Straub shifts between present day and the 1950's so often it becomes very difficult to follow the characters and to understand their develoment. The basic germ of the story is good but the execution is very sloppy. Don't buy this book.
5,My favourite novel in any genre.,"I like lush, richly-textured prose, and this Straub delivers amply. The storyline is gothic, dense, hallucinatory; all adjectives that appeal greatly to my psyche. If you like Gene Wolfe, Michael Moorcock, and Charles Dickens, especially in a morbid and heady combination, you'll love this book."
4,The first rule of Magic,"I bought this book after reading The Talisman, which Straub cowrote with Stephen King, and I loved it. While there were times that it felt (only slightly) disjointed, there was nothing to take away from my enjoyment of the story, and the characters.While I was rooting for different outcomes, and different paths for certain characters, Im extremely pleased with where Straub took them. I definitely enjoyed the stories Coleman Collins told (The King of the Cats in particular), but the grande illusions he cast could have been defined a bit better for my taste. Either way, it was a fantastic book that made me late for work on more than one occasion, as I could not put it down."
4,A Great Book of Magic and Mystery,"Peter Straub has been called the thinking man's Stephen King. I think that he is the thinking man's Peter Straub. Mr. Straub has once again written a novel that has a plot too complicated to sumerize, but is an incredible work to read. Like his two best books, GHOST STORY and KOKO, SHADOWLAND is filled with interesting and very realistic characters. Like his other books SHADOWLAND at first seems utterly confusing, but by the end everything comes together in ways that will amaze and delite."
2,Not worth getting if you're a Shah Rukh Khan fan,"I bought this film because I am a Shah Rukh Khan fan. He only appeared twice...once briefly near the middle of the film, and again, very briefly during a musical number at the end. I really like Rani Mukerji and Preity Zinta - and seeing them in the film was enjoyable. This film has a similar storyline to the Hollywood film ""While You Were Sleeping"" with Sandra Bullock. To me, it didn't have the charm that Sandra Bullock's film did. I'm not a fan of Salman Khan. So, that has an affect on my impressions of this film."
3,A film about sacrificing love,"The film has nothing special to offer, except for very very melodious songs by Anu Malik, two beautiful girls (Preity Zinta and Rani Mukherjee), who, at that point of time, were reasonably newcomers, and today, both are the top actresses in India. It was nice to watch the film, as an entertainer, and there are some funny scenes. But the film does not have some novel script which can capture you.Watch it if you are a fan of Salman, Preity and to some extent Rani, and want to have some good two-three hours."
1,Silly and boring,"This movie was so out of touch with reality and, as a result, so silly. I feel I wasted three hours of my time watching this silly movie. I would definitely NOT recommend it. It may have Salman Khan and two leading ladies, but the concept of the movie was idiotic. I could not wait to view the ending so I could turn it off, put the DVD away, let dust grow on it and never see it again. I would not even give it to a friend--but maybe an enemy!"
3,A VERY LOW-KEY MOVIE OF SELF-DISCOVERY,"I have recently seen this movie for the first time. Mathew Pearson and Jeanpaul Sanpedro are real men, dealing with real men's issues. It's hard to find this topic being explored on film anywhere--and in a way that does it justice, but this topic could have been done better. The acting is not the high point. The main characters appear to be hungering for a deeper connection and epitomize the modern American dating dilemma: is anyone really ""authentic"" anymore? The film, however, has captured the zeitgeist of changing views on human sexuality, where people are drifting back and forth between what they think they want and what they know they need."
2,Nothing Special,"Thalia has come to Australia to make a fresh and to be albe to bring her little sister out to the new world. Ian Lavery has made his mission help to protect the Aborigine from the bushrangers. A group of men who love to the Aborigine wiped out. Ian loved Thalia the first time that he saw her, but before he can make his moved she is claimed by Paul Hathaway. The fight for Ian and Thalia is a long one.""Roses after Rain"" is the first book by Cassie Edwards and it really wasn't that good. The characters were flat and not interesting. The was so boring that I found myself flipping pages and not really reading. I have two more book by the author on my shelf and I am wondering if I should even bother reading them cause ""Roses after Rain"" was that good and waste of my time."
5,A ray of light in the darkness,The mini post lamp is a marvelous addition to any outside sitting area. It provides an ideal amount of light for eating or just visiting. The appearace is such that it goes with almost any decor and is well made and sturdy as well as attractive.
1,Poor choice,This outdoor unit started to rust within a few months of exposure to weather conditions in south Florida. Would not recommend it to anyone. The height of the lamp shines right at eye level making it difficult to see with the glare of the bulb right in your eyes.
2,Surface quality lacking,"I tried these as a cheaper alternative to Memorex printable CD-R's that I had used before. The HP discs aren't nearly as nice as the Memorex. The HP discs have a surface texture, almost rough, that feels like an adhesive paper label has already been applied. The Memorex brand has a smooth, slick surface that's much nicer."
5,Well done,If you want to open your mind and heart and see the scriptures in a broader more beautiful light- this is the book for you.
4,Kodak High Goss Ultra Premium Paper,"I have always used Kodak paper and hope to be able to keep that up. I have not found anything as good, in color hold, sharpness in finish. Just all around satifaction everytime I use Kodak paper."
2,Disappointing book,"The author's intent -- to examine the impact of McCarthyism on anthropology -- is a good one. Anthropology attracts a lot of liberal minded people (someone told me that they tend to register Democrat over Republican by a 30-1 ratio). However, what is disappointing about this book is that Price didn't seek out to interview more of the people who knew these anthropologists, as well as people in government who actually wrote such reports. For the most part, reports/texts are largely taken at face value, whereas in reality reports may have been received in greater or lesser degrees of seriousness and credibility. Thus, the tendency is probaby to exaggerate the degree of victimization."
2,Very byist-,"This was a good book for the facts but the writer chooses to be byist against the Europeans. He sends out the message that the Native Americans were PERFECT and the Europeans totally destroyed them. i agree that the Europeans massacred the Indians horribly, which was wrong but the Indians had their own flaws too which the author neglects to put in."
1,One star because I couln't give it a zero,"More tripe about how one ""man"" discovered other humans. The ""objective"" view of this man as a hero is still present, helping to perpetuate the myth that Natives were not as valuable as the oppressors who came to colonize them. I am not the type to say burn books, but this would make great kindling for the fires of truth. You might be able to use it in a discussion of racism and the epestimologies that help create and foster it. There are plenty of Italian people who were heroes, this person is just not one of them."
3,Beautifully illustrated but not well-suited to young children,"I purchased this book online for my son, an avid fan of story-time. The illustrations are soft, detailed and simply beautiful. The idea behind the story is equally good: what is in your heart and in nature are worth much more than anything money can buy. However, my young son was not familiar with the names of the many fine gem stones that the bunny seeks in the story. Similarly, he didn't comprehend that these items have been given a special value in our society. This story might be better appreciated by a child with knowledge of those concepts. Similarly, an older child would probably understand the text more easily. The story is embedded in a rhyming form that seems forced and in some places, a little too much like a hallmark card. A beautiful book best enjoyed by a child in the upper end of the recommended age group."
4,Beautiful illustrations,"We love any book illustrated by Maggie Kneen - my 3.5 year old daughter actaully ask for books with pictures by ""Maggie."" If you are looking for a Valentine book with a sweet story this is the one - the pictures alone are worth the purchase. The story ryhmes and as another reader stated, they words sometimes do not work very well, but the book is still a beautiful read."
5,preschool Valentine,"This was given to my almost 4 year old Grandson. He absolutely loves the book, and wants it read over and over. He absorbs the pictures, enjoys the rhymes of each page, and of course loves to open each flap to see what the treasure really is. This was one Valentine gift that was a real hit!!"
3,Good - but the Easter book is better,"I bought this book based on the Easter book by the same author. We love the Easter version, and while this book is good, the Easter version is much better. I would give the Easter version closer to 5 stars."
5,Wondeful history of The Hajj,"I read this book back in 2003. By collecting the firsthand accounts of travellers and shaping their experiences into a richly detailed narrative, F. E. Peters have provided an unparalleled literary history of the central ritual of Islam from its remote pre-Islamic origins to the end of the Hashemite Kingdom of the Hijaz in 1926.By reading this book one gets a god idea of the cost of doing The Hajj and the logistics involved in. I highly recommend this book."
4,Works for me,"I use my Evoluent Vertical Mouse for about 6 hours per day and I've had it for 4 months now. It's great. I used to have pain along the back of my hand between my wrist and knuckles when I was mousing. Now, no pain at all. I use my mouse without a pad. Perfectly comfortable. And moving the cursor is just as precise and controllable as with my old Microsoft mouse. I tried using a pad under it, but that was a bad idea--now I use it right on the desktop.Other reviewers have commented on the tendency of the cursor to jump down a couple of lines when you click on something. That happens once or twice a day--a minor annoyance which I gladly put up with in order to be pain free."
1,Poor quality,"I should clarify that yo-zuri lures in my opinion are the best, but this time I got 3 good lures that meet the characteristics of the brand and 4 lures that look like a bad copy, are thinner, the tongue is smaller, the lure is painted has a sticker and the hooks are small and thin.I have the doubt if the seller did it deliberately or is a manufacturer's quality problem. I do not recommend this seller lures."
3,Not too impressive,"Though the DVD flash cards do about what they claim to, I found the implementation to be poor. Very difficult to see at any realistic distance from the Television, it was necessary for me to move very close to the screen to take full advantage of the product. In that I had hoped this would work out as a ""spur of the moment"" review to act as an adjunct to my regular studies this product wasn't easy to use spontaneously."
2,Do not buy this book used,"Careful with buying a used copy of this book. The code provided in the book only works once, and without it, you can't register for the simulation, and you'll have to buy a brand new book in order to do so.If you are thinking of buying a used book, realize that the previous owner may have already used the code, and it will therefore not work for you."
3,"Good, but barely a mention of online identity","Perhaps my review is a bit jaded because I went into this book looking speficially for online identity issues like ""how does a designer begin to keep a user on a website with thousands of other options available?"" This is the best, hardest identity issue to hit in a long time. As the book was printed in 1998, I expected SOMETHING about online isues. But there was nothing. I'd also like to speak to whomever designed the layout about the superfluous, messy grids and lines that cover each page. It's very, very stylized and already outdated."
4,Comfortable,"I bought this shoes and they are absolutely the best shoes, they are very comfortable, so if you are looking for comfort and good value this shoes are it."
5,Great deal,All I can say is: great knife. This knife is very sturdy despite it being only 2/3rd tang. I've used it as everything from a pry bar to a throwing knife. I trounced around the swamps of Ft. Campbell and sprinted through those muddy swamps with this attached to my boot and it shows almost no wear or tear despite my abuse. No other knife I've known has shown the ruggedness that this one shows for the price.
4,A Good Knife,"I bought one of these for my son who went to Iraq and he liked it so I picked up one for myself. Very sharp. Good quality. My only complaint is that the tip will rattle in the sheath, so I put some cotton in the bottom and that took care of it."
2,Paddle switch issues,"Pulse paddle switch stopped working after six months, took it into a Waring Certified Repair Center, they fixed it, but it took about six weeks to get it back. Then after about another month, the high/low paddle switch stopped working. We contacted the on-line retailer who sold it to us, they contacted Waring who authorized us to send it back. We received a brand new unit about three weeks later. When it works, it's fantastic, but be warned that these paddle-switches seem prone to failure."
5,Last Blender you'll ever need,"Bulky, noisy and takes up lots of space - BUT it is the greatest drink mixer you'll ever buy. My wife is the queen of frosty drinks. With this blender the ingredients don't separate half-way through your drinking pleasure. Our old mixer, also touted as a professional blender, caused the ingedients to separate in the glass after about 3 minutes. Have not seen that happening after this blender get's through doing its job. Crushes ice without cringing and is esstially oblivious to anything thrown in, just blends everyting into a great pulp. Highly recommended for the serious frosty drinker."
5,Excellent!!!,"Item arrived exactly as described. Highly recommended, would do business with them again. A + + + + + +"
2,Switch problem,"Powerful blender. Loud but efficient. Great with ice. However...after 2 months of mild use, the high,low switch quit working. Pulse switch still works but worried it will give out as well. Finding a service center or returning ( which doesn't seem to be an option) is difficult when living on an island in Alaska. Expensive. Not sure I would buy again given this issue."
5,Exactly what we were hoping for!,"We were in search of a heavy duty blender to make hearty smoothies on a daily basis. This blender fits the bill. It was also more reasonably priced than some of the high end brands, but we feel that it works just as well. I would highly recommend this product!"
3,??Question??,Is the Waring MX1000R or MX1050XTP really 3.5 HP Blenders--scientifically? If so can they be plugged into regular home outlet with a strong power surge cord for protection?
4,Good blender,"This blender is good and powerful. I purchased it to make smoothies in hopes that it would bust up the tiny little berry seeds. It did not. Although I returned the product, it worked very well in every other way."
1,disappointment,Buyers be aware! This dvd is only for playing in region 1! A disappointed giver and receiver on Christmas Day!
5,7th Heaven season 6,Wow this season took forever 2 realease but well worth the wait if you are a true fan because this season and the rest after this season shows the growth and maturity of the camadan kids and we see Lucy make the right choice in boyfriends go Kevin and Lucy Kinkirk hopfully season 7-11 is not far behind
4,Great resource,Short and sweet.... It has everything I liked about the original books and is in a format that I can use to easily torture my players. Good stuff!
5,Making money can be fun!,"Don't let the comic book format fool you! Money is serious business. But let's face it -- that's bor-ring! Yet Tim Turtle makes a strong case for achieving financial intelligence when he runs out of money at the amusement park. He thinks the answer to his money problems is to get a job. When Red Rat laughs at him and says he'll never get rich by working at a job, poor Tim is totally confused. But isn't that how to make money? Instead Red Rat shows him the difference between working for money and making money work for him. Based on Kiyosaki's bestselling book ""Rich Dad, Poor Dad"", this comic book adventure into the world of finance brings money issues to life. How to find moneymaking opportunities and create assets are explored in ways that are fun and easy to understand.Copyright (c) 2005 by Peggy Tibbetts"
3,"Good message, flimsy construction.","My son asked right off the bat, why the pages aren't numbered and why is it falling apart. Same old Rich Dad messages.....I thought it was worth sharing with him. Pick it up at the library."
3,Marcus Miller,This was Marcus Miller's debut release as a leader. It is finally available on CD after almost 20 years. If you're accustomed to Marcus' recent recordings this is not as refined. He does some singing and it has that unmistakable 80's sound. Which now sounds dated and cheesy.But it is a must have for those die hard Miller fans to witness the evolution of his sound and how even though this is over 20 years old there is no doubt who the bass player is.
4,80's synth bass pop.,"As a viewer stated before, if you're used to MM's recent recordings this is not the CD for you. Yes, the sound of this album definitely targeted the year it was released but all in all it's another good album from a very talented musician."
4,A Star Called the Sun,"This book discusses the physical and chemical makeup of the Sun in our solar system and how this applies to other stars found in the universe. A person who reads this book must have a small amount of general science. The book was written to appeal to the general population who is curious about the stars and their makeup. You will find the math is minimum. It will introduce the reader to the Sun's turbulent surface, how solar activity influence the Earth, The Law of Plasma, the concept of the atom and the energy that an atom has, the definition of a Red Giant and White Dwarf and how they evolve, with a historical perspective of how these theories have evolved over the years. If you are looking for a book that will delve into Astrophysics with a heavy concentration in celestial mechanics this book is not for you."
1,Defective,"A very impressive looking oven. The temperature dial did not reflect the actual internal temperature of the oven by 50 to 75 degrees. Once I got that sorted out, the oven worked well about 20 times. Then the motor started to sputter on and off. Burning electrical odor filled the air and an arcing sound could be heard. While it worked, it worked well. I do not know if the defect is common or rare. I tested only one oven."
1,Junk !,"I purchased this oven about 2 years ago, and have been satisfied with it... until it completely stopped producing heat a couple of months ago. I just got off the phone with Waring's product department; not only is this problem not a warranty issue, but there is no way to fix it. The oven is now a doorstop. Instead of being productive on my countertop, this oven is now destined to take up space in a landfill. Sickening, since I have friends with other ovens of this type that are decades older and still working.Do not purchase this oven !"
5,"Lord, so much drama.","This book was awesome! the drama, the language, the foreshadowing. I laughed out loud at least 10 times, especially on the part of the book when Davis's mom put a ""Spongebob"" band-aid on his [unmentionable part]. That was hilarious, Toschia's writing style is extremely ""real"" yet it's obvious that she is well versed in literature and advanced writing techiniques. As an avid reader, I give debut novel a heads up, for a first time novelist."
3,so wrong,"I read this book when it first came out and i must say i was at a loss for words. Rhea is an accomplished young woman of mixed heritages. each culture that she's mixed with is known for being strong and confident. Rhea showed to be just that until she met the a boy not even worth being called a man.She falls for his sweet talk and sex causing her to take leave of her senses. Rhea is beyond stupid when it comes to this man. he has kids by another woman that his mother keeps. she has encounters with the baby mama and still take back her man. he's a liar, with no real job or income and it's just plain ridiculous. He says he lost his job, his car etc the same ole bull that scrubs pull everyday.i was shocked with the way this story ended. i don't know if Rhea is dead or what. there has to be a sequel to this book and as i stated earlier, i read this book when it first came out and still no sequel to date hmmm...."
1,Did I miss a few pages?,"I'm sorry, but this book was not good. The plot was going somewhere until the main character started being pathetic. The author started dishing out useless information about less important characters, and the ending leaves MUCH to be desired. Please, if you MUST read this book borrow it from the library, or better yet, you can have my copy. Sorry Soror....."

5,great camera bag cover,"I bought this with the complete seed camera bag, and love it. it was bigger than what I thought, but I needed the space."
4,fun music,"new-wave ""pogo punk"". songs are fun and catchy. my favorites are I My Me Mine and Wild One. Comparible to Devo but 'happier'"
3,Good But Not Their Best,"The main problem I have with the c.d. is that it is not what I ordered. The c.d. was supposed to include the first two releases by felt, but I got the single (Crumbling...) by itself. The market place seller blamed Amazon and bugged me to remove my poor rating. So be wary of any seller with too high a rating. For some it's not customer service that's important to them but the illusion of perfection (Their rating). The c.d. itself is good not great but I knew that since I had the c.d. before. Of cource I previously owned the version with the stronger Splendour of Fear e.p. included on the same c.d. but I have given up on that now. So Amazon shoppers be careful. The version you are buying might not be what you get."
5,Shimmering beauty,"This is really two albums on one CD: Crumbling The Antiseptic Beauty and The Splendour of Fear. Obviously Lawrence and Deebank of Felt were hugely influenced by Tom Verlaine and Television. Still, it doesn't feel like a rip-off of Television's sound. I love the liquid, shimmering reverb drenched guitar and atmospherics on this recording. Sure Lawrence's vocals are an acquired taste, much in the same way that Tom Verlaine's singing is not everyone's cup of tea. The drumming technique by Gary Ainge is interesting and not always perfectly in time. In fact there are little flaws here and there in the singing and playing, but somehow it makes this set all the more appealing. Felt recorded other albums, mostly really short EP length stuff, but this one is head and shoulders above the rest. Crumbling The Antiseptic Beauty, The Splendour of Fear which clocks in around 60 minutes is so cool from start to finish. Trippy, gorgeous, morose but fun!"
1,Don't Waste Your Money!!,"I deeply regret spending money on this vulgar mishmash of terrible writing, characters without any credibility, and a lame plot. I was in a mood for easy, non-demanding fiction, but I trashed this. Don't waste your money on this pandering imitation of far superior fictions. If any good can come of this, it is that someone might be spared my experience! Karen Quinn, I demand a refund."
2,Mediocre... amusing in parts but very average in general,"This story has the possibility of being very entertaining but fails rather miserably. There are brief moments that are reasonably funny, but overall I'd say that it was an average read. That said, the story is fairly decent so if youre about to board a plane or take a train and want something light to read, you may enjoy this. I read it having heard great things and I must say I was disappointed. However if you pick it up as a means to pass some time, without high expectations, you may like it. Definitely something to take out of a library, not buy - you will not read it twice."
5,Loved the Ivy Chronicles,"This book is hysterical. It gives an over-the-top, yet realistic view of corporate life, private school admissions, crazy parents and love. It gets better and funnier with every page. I hate putting it down.Thank you, Karen Quinn, for writing such an entertaining book. I hope you write another one really soon."
3,Best character was Faith,"I thought this book was entertaining... but at the end of the day, the author really leaves you feeling like the character who had the most in life was Faith - Ivy's best friend who married a billionaire husband and didn't work. She seemed to lead a charmed life that most of us would love to have (drivers, chefs, nannies, closet organizers, etc). I doubt it was the author's intent to make readers feel like money can buy happiness, but it sure felt like it at times. Which is a hard lesson to swallow for the avg middle class citizen."
2,OY!,"Sometimes I wonder how books get published.This story jumped around so much and the resolutions were so random. Ivy was such a shallow character that I just couldn't even enjoy the story...and I was WANTING to! I love the genre and was a fan of Nanny Diaries and even Devil Wears Prada, but this one seemed as if it was written in one sitting. It was also the MOST predictable story ever! I wasn't looking for some literary masterpiece, but this just didn't cut it as an entertaining beach read."
1,This is an awful book,"I thought this would be a cute, fun read, but it wasn't cute or fun. Totally unrealistic (for example, Ivy's former co-workers get eaten by crocodiles...Come ON) and an insult to intelligent readers who were hoping to get an amusing insider's look at the world of admissions into Manhattan's private schools for the youngest kids. Ivy is not a likable character, the story is depressing and really just plods along, the sex scenes are overly graphic, and it was just a waste of time. I couldn't even get through the first quarter of this book before skimming ahead to see if it would get any better. That's when I knew for sure that I would be missing absolutely nothing by returning this book to the library as fast as it could go."
2,"Didn't care for the ""humour""","The blurb says ""ferociously funny"" but to me, a single mother getting sacked, cheated on, ... etc! and under so much pressure her kid feels she's being neglected,just isn't funny."
1,Do NOT waste your time like I did. . .,"As a matter of fact if the author could give me back the day of my life that I wasted reading this junk, that would be a suitable refund. One of the WORST books ever written."
1,I'm glad I checked it out of the library,"I'm so tired of over-simplified chick-fiction that features a nice, tidy resolution in every chapter provided by SOME EXTRAORDINARY COINCIDENCE. Come on! Deus ex machina might have sufficed in the Middle Ages, but I need something more challenging, even in my escapist reading. In fact, I read the first five chapters, skipped to the last chapter, and still knew exactly what had transpired in between."
3,A light read,"Ivy Ames is having a very bad day. First she loses her job, then she finds her husband cheating on her. To surport herself, Ivy decides to become to kindergater advisor to New York's riches families. But Ivy has no idea what she is in for. Parents that would do anything to help their child into school including, backmail, lying or anything else.I really liked this book in the beginning, but as the book progress, I began to dislike Ivy, she just seem so shallow and for a woman who worked with children, she did not have much time for own. Its a light read but not much more."
2,"Not as unlikeable as it should be, but still","Ivy annoyed me. I'll just put that out there right from the start. I found her character grating at times. She was whiney and pathetic, as well as devious and mean. Combine that with the very preach tone of a lot of the book, and I should be rating it a lot lower than I am. And yet, somehow, the book was still tolerable - and I'm not sure how. Looking back on it, thinking about it analytically, I should have hated it. But I'll rate it as 'just okay'. It would be a good commuter audio book, I don't know that I'd invest free time in listening to it."
1,"This is really, really bad","I'm a writer and a mom of young children and when I read this I was looking for some enlightenment...at the very least some entertainment. This is a poorly written book with a remarkably thin, assinine plot and a ridiculous main character. I think it appeals to some moms out there because they've truly lost their intellectual capabilities and identities by focusing all their attention on their children and spending most of their time in coffee klatches with other like-minded moms."
5,NYC Mama,"It's been quite a while since reading a book made me laugh out loud while taking public transportation. Karen Quinn's light-hearted, over the top satire of the crazed world of corporate life and that of wealthy parents is a hoot. It's a fun, feel-good read!!!"
1,disgusting,Why is it necessary to belittle overweight people in every other chapter? Did anyone else notice this?
2,What a disappointment,"This was a book that I tried to give the benefit of the doubt and really wanted to finish (against my better judgment). It was hard to care about these characters, though, especially Ivy and this made it hard for this reader to get through it. The book was not very well written either (please tell me she didn't actually use the sentence ""It was extremely cool."")."
5,I loved the Ivy Chronicles,"I laughed when I read the previous negative reviews. The Ivy Chronicles was one of the funniest books I've read in a very long time. I stayed up all night and the next night to finish it. It is fresh, irreverent, farcical and yes, sometimes over the top. But as any parent of a private school kid in New York City will tell you, it is not as far from reality as you might think. The insanity involved in getting a child into kindergarten in this city is so real that Karen Quinn's book, by the end, only seemed to me a mild satire. The reviewer before me who thought the child whose skin turned successively darker and darker until she was ultimately admitted to a school was too farfetched-well, stranger things have happened in this city in the pursuit of admissions! I have given this book as a gift to many friends and they've called me immediately to thank me for one of the best reads they've had in ages."
4,What would you do to get your child into kindergarten?,"Well these parents top it all! They lie, cheat, threaten, bribe, and the list goes on! Not only are the parents doing it, but Ivy who has had the worst luck with her job and husband and needs money to support her own children is involved.Although I do agree she didn't redeem herself fully, this book was entertaining and laughable. I don't live like them, so I have no clue about that kind of lifestyle. It seems none of them appreciate what they have, or realize that these are CHILDREN but it was entertaining and I did enjoy it. Isn't that what a book is sometimes? Away from the world, a place to escape and fantasize?"
2,Skip it.,"It's been a long time since I've disliked a protagonist as much as I hated Ivy Ames. While the premise of the book was intriguing (an insider's view into the cut-throat world of the Manhattan elite), my antipathy for Ivy overroad any hopes of my giving this book a good review.She continually baffled me with her amoral stance and her ability to turn everything into a one-woman whine-fest. There was almost no one to cheer for, save some of the stereotypical ""underclass"" children. I almost quit reading several times, but somehow convinced myself to carry on.It's unfortunate, because Quinn is a talented writer. She just needs to work on creating some likable characters -- maybe some with morals."
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"Maybe the most poorly written book I've read in a long time. Not funny. Not Involving. Not even worth wasting my time writing this review but I just found it so darn annoying!!!!! Try Charlotte Simmons (now Tom Wolfe, there's someone WHO CAN WRITE!!) Try Admissions. Try Prep. Try Private Schools for Dummies. Try to avoid this dreck."
1,A Stupid Plot,"I had some hopes for The Ivy Chronicles, and for the first 150 or so pages, I liked it enough to continue reading. The plot idea was very interesting to me, and I love a good satire. However, the story becomes increasingly absurd to the point that I simply could not suspend reality any longer. I stopped short of finishing it."
3,Fluffy enjoyable read,"I actually listened to this book on cd because I drive a lot and it helps make my driving less monotonous. So, I may not have enjoyed reading it as much as I enjoyed listening to it. The main character, Ivy is terribly shallow and part of the irony of the book, I found, was listening to her chastise others for their moral foibles while doing the same things herself. The tongue-and-cheek parody of all the characters and some of the over-the-top situations made me laugh out loud at certain points. The whole book was a clever dig at high society and who doesn't enjoy that? I recommend it for anyone looking for a bit of fun and snarkiness to bring some levity to your day. I also did appreciate that Ivy genuinely tried to be less shallow by the end of the book, although, I doubt she was able to keep it up that long."
3,Mildly entertaining.,"This book is an easy and somewhat pleasant read that you will forget almost as soon as you've read the last words. Rather simplistic, it doesn't venture to provide any keen or original insights and is not even particularly effective as a guilty pleasure since it does not provide more than a cursory glance into a world most would never get to see."
4,Funny,"Overall, the book was enjoyable to read. It did tend to read more like a movie script, though."
2,Not sure about this one,"Not a bad book, but I found the main character hard to like. She's selfish and superficial but of course learns lessons along the way. Ok if you're after a weekend fluffy read."
1,Insulting,"I, too, expected this to be like The Nanny Diaries. Boy, was I in for a surprise. For starters, the authors of The Nanny Diaries actually had talent.If you can even get past the fact that most of this story is utterly unbelievable, you will quickly grow to dislike the ""heroine"" of the story, a shallow, mewling, spoiled woman named Ivy (wow... the subtlety is amazing). I put the book down after one too many fat jokes.When I pick up chick-lit, I'm not expecting Pulitzer Prize quality, but the character was NOT likeable, the plot was completely unbelievable, and the writing was so childish. If you're looking for good chick lit, do not pick up this book."
1,I should have read more reviews first.,"Boring, unfunny and a waste of time. I don't know and don't want to know anyone who actually lives this way. What's more, I have no interest in reading such self-centered whining."
3,not for the beginner,"They say this is a great book. That's probably true for some but I have most of Dr. Cleary's books; read them many times, benefited immensely, but this book is not easily comprehensible to me and I would think to any casual reader. As in his other books there is no real and ready quick tips for handling everyday life. So, unless you are well versed in Buddhist scripture save your money and apply yourself to the dharma as taught in simpler texts."
5,A priceless treasure,"Although I'm sure I'm quite ignorant of the larger context of this book, if I could only take one book into a cell for the remainder of my life, I would choose this. At the rate of a few pages most evenings (aloud) I'm half way through and looking forward to beginning again, more slowly next time. They say that if you study Lam-rim, it helps you with any Buddhist teachings you might come across. For this reason, I find every page filled with gems. I had owned it for two years before I returned from a Tibetan Buddhist retreat and discovered that the final pages are ""The Noble King of Vows of the Conduct of Samantabhadra""."
4,The introduction itself is amazing.,"I'm only beginning to dig my way into this text, but would like to mention that the introduction is a masterful piece of writing in and of itself, comparing the teachings found in the Avatamsaka Sutra to those of other significant Mahayana sutras. Not only does the context help to provide intimacy with the concepts found here, but it provides a quick run through important Buddhist concepts that this sutra seeks to encompass and surpass. Personally, I'm spending about 30-45 minutes a day reading this massive thing, and alternating between the intro and the sutra itself day to day. It has been a really great experience!"
2,"Wilton tilting turntable wobbles, not good for smoothing sides","Transaction went great; received right away. However, turn table wobbles when turned, no matter what position it is locked into. So I only use it for angled piping and not smoothing the sides down. Disappointed. I don't know if this is standard and all of them do that, or if mine is slightly defective. I definitely would like to know."
4,Don't care for this......,"Don't care for this, don't turn fast and the rubbber get in your way. Gonna have to buy a Cast Iron like Ateco."
4,Very useful,This is the turntable I use as my portable for competitions and bridal expos. I can pack it up and bring it out on site to finish and assemble my wedding cakes on the go. My only complaint is that the top comes off the base so easily.
3,Good watertight box,"Not the same quality of the pelican brand but ok. The box has a watertight seal and can hold quite a few items you intend to keep dry. It can be used to keep survival kit, electronics, etc. dry inside a vehicle or packs, etc. It fits nicely inside the Maxpedition Mongo Versipack to keep items protected and dry. High visibility yellow will prevent loss if you are using it in the dark outdoors."
4,Does what it is suppose to do,I bought this almost 2 years ago to store my phone when I am out fishing. The case has worked great and have saved me from damaging my phone twice. It is water proof and it does float. one of the reviews I read stated that his/her case has warped. In the 2 years I have had this case I have not experienced any warping even after dropping in salt water and on concrete a few times.
5,otter 3250,"Great size to put keys, wallet and cell phone in. I have 3 off these over 10 years, never a leak or failure."
4,"works well, but chipped when dropped","I like this OtterBox, but the edge of a corner on the lid chipped when I dropped it ... kinda defeats part of the reason for getting it."
1,PATENTLY DEFECTIVE PRODUCT SHIPPED ?!! WTF.......,"amazing....they shipped a defective product to me - a patently defective product...one of the clasps was not attached - obviously missing. These things don't just fall off or break off. It was completely missing - the entire clasp/bracket on the right hand side. Very poor quality control at production and a careless packer who shipped a patently defective product.sad..............very lamePelican cases are better quality and you don't have this defective, missing, weak or easily broken clasp issue which crops up quite often with Otter boxes.bottom line: Go Pelican and avoid Otter box..."
4,Hard to open but great product,"This product looks and feels strong, sturdy, shock and waterproof. Can't wait to test it. I also bought another one for my boyfriend. We live in the Caribbean and are constantly doing water-sports so, let's see if this really works as stated. I love this brand's products, the color but have to say some of them are a little bit hard to open. The first didn't open and was inmediatley exchanged for another one that worked properly. I'm in love with the product and appreciate the returns policy of this company. Thank you so much for your help. Happy customer here. :)"
4,It was a hit!,"My 8-year-old grandson was super excited when he opened the Marble Run Vortex at his birthday party. He said, ""I've *always* wanted one of these!"" He built all the different formations the next day, before he played with any of his other gifts. It was a hit!"
1,"Very poor design, flimmsy at best","This marble run, and similar varieties by Quercetti sold by Amazon, Target, and other stores, is terrible. The plastic pieces do not stay together. An ADULT will spend almost all of their time constantly re-assembling falling down sections they attempt to put together. Assembly for a child of 4+ (age recommendation by the manufacturer) is impossible. I've used marble runs from other manufacturers and have not experienced this level of poor design. However, I've never seen a marble run that is made so that the pieces connect solid and certainly not one that can be assembled by the recommended age. I believe in general they are not worth the effort and time trying to get them together and to stay together. Do something else that's much more interactive and satisfying with your child."
1,Very Dissapointed!!!,"The Pictures of the producst show Crystal Glass balls, but it came with cheap plastic balls. No assembly instruction included. It so poorly design that bottom level ball holder does not have the space to hold all balls comming from top level holder. The bases are unstable, so at the minimum intent to move the toy, it will be necessary to assemble it again."
2,So so,"Bought this for my grandson, age 5. It is hard to keep this item together. Kept falling apart. Not good for someone his age."
1,Marble Disappointment,"I see our problems with this set are pretty standard. The structure falls apart and the spiral pieces don't properly function. I had a great marble run set as a child and we have a good one for our older daughter already.Here are our issues:--It says 80 pieces--the majority are small connector pieces. Actual marble run pieces are less than ten.--The connector pieces don't stay together well. Some require a second piece put over them to connect, which doesn't have 360 degree connect ability, so you are limited in how you construct your set.--The set falls apart easily.--The most interesting looking pieces are the flimsiest--they connect poorly, sag unevenly, and the marbles just fall off.--We bought this to add to the existing marble run system we owned. It is not compatible.I cannot believe how badly this set performs. Maybe the folks giving it decent reviews have never experienced a well-constructed set."
3,Good toy.. But unnecessary price hike,My friend brought me this toy three weeks ago for $22 (incl tax) and suddenly the price has increased 29.99 since its close to Thanksgiving and Christmas! this is ridiculous.. I wanted to buy another one for my nephew and was disappointed to see the price hike.I like the toy.. it helps the kids learn to build the run and my son is quite engaged with this product. But I am disappointed with the price now.
3,"Fun, but...",My five year old son got this for Christmas. He is frustrated because it is difficult for him to build by himself. Once I finish building it he loves it except that one of the three base legs doesn't lie flat on the table and this effects the stability of the game. A bit frustrating for both of us but my son does enjoy playing with it.
5,Marble Run,"This works just how its supposed to, definitely for older kids, unless the parents decide to build it for the younger kids, otherwise, they can't get it to do much. But they love playing when it's put together. Make sure they play with it on a sturdy table or stand, not on carpet & the marbles are smaller than normal marbles, so be extra careful with the youngsters & pets!"
3,Fun but flimsy,"It was fun, but not what I remember as a kid at all. My nephew seemed to enjoy it after I assembled it. Maybe better for children older than 5."
5,The First Thing He Opened!,"We bought this as a gift for a boy who just turned five. I really wasn't sure what he was into and did not know what he already had (we have a daughter), so it was difficult to choose. We thought this might be fun, and the price was right. So I thought we'd give it a try. Also, when he grew out of it, his baby sister might like it.Well, the birthday boy's parents called us the next day to say that of the 25 (not kidding) presents he opened after his birthday party, this was the one he wanted to play with first! He was such a fortunate youngster, the other toys were Lego, Playmobil, and Transformers. What boy wouldn't love that?! I think we found a winner. (His baby sister likes it too, but it isn't completely sturdy. She knocks it down all the time. Thankfully birthday boy likes it so much, he's happy to put it back together.)"
5,Great fun!,"Wow, how much fun is this!? Lots! My 3 year old son is fascinated by the marble action. The pieces fit together really easily, although they fall part easily too. But once we figured out how to tighten and stack, it worked better. I wish it came with instructions on putting them together. My son isn't quite at the age to do it all on his own and I apparently am not imaginative enough! But overall a lot of fun and a great gift!"
2,Not too happy,"Received this toy. Very flimsy compared to the original Marble Works brand. Very difficult to assemble and keep assembled unless done exactly like the picture. I had to set it up for my 6 year old because she was unalble to keep the pieces straight and level. (She's usually very good at assembling things) Once together, she had a blast with it, but overall, I wouldn't recommend the item."
1,Flimsy,This marble run is flimsy! The pieces don't fit together well enough for any real playing. You will spend all of your time trying to hold the pieces together as the structure falls apart.
1,Worst movie ever,"Las vegas showgirls fight terrorists in the middle east. The acting is so terrible that I can't even put it into words. One of the girls kept stopping halfway through a sentence to try to remember her lines. Movie producers, please hire real actors not pill popping strippers. Thanks"
1,How Much Screaming Can You Take?,"I bought this CD because it came with a sticker that said All Out War was similar to bands I started listening to in the 1980's, like Nuclear Assault. Was I in for a disappointment. Bands like Nuclear Assault were fast and heavy, but they also had a sense of dynamics in their sound. When you listened to a Nuclear Assault album, all of the songs sounded different. All of the songs on CONDEMNED TO SUFFER sound pretty much the same.Musically, All Out War are similar to Slayer. Their vocalist - if you want to call him that - just screams at the top of his lungs on every songs. There's nothing dynamic in his approach. I was worn out after listening to six or seven songs.True Crossover is C.O.C., D.R.I., the Crumbsuckers, the Cro-Mags, early Suicidal Tendencies, Sacrilege B.C., and S.O.D. All Out War doesn't come close to being anything like those bands."
4,Excellent metal/hardcore crossover,"This band sounds like Slayer mixed with the New York hardcore sound. The music is excellent, it's fast with plenty of breakdowns and the vocals are intense and tough guy sounding. My major problem with this band is the generic christian lyrics. I have a hard time taking the lyrics seriously when they sing about how angels fighting demons. If you can ignore the stupid lyrics then I suggest you pick this up if you like Lamb of God, Hatebreed, Sworn Enemy, Shadows Fall, Sick of it All, Slayer, Chimaira, Merauder or any other metal and hardcore bands. If you like bands who mix tough guy new york hardcore and thrash metal then I suggest you check this out if you can stomach the weak Christian lyrics."
2,ok,"ok cd, nothing significant about it either. Same ol brutal Metal that 1/2 a billion other bands are trying to do."
3,same old s***,if you like hatebreed this group is for you from the vocals to the music its hatebreed there is really nothing else to say
4,Awesome album,"my only complaint is the way that vince sings on with the show, it sounds out of tune, but other than that, great cd. highly recommended"
3,Not bad.,"Too Fast for Love is pretty good. Don't see how it could be anyone's favorite, but it's not bad. Listening to this album now, you can tell the band really matured greatly in their other albums.4 or 5 good songs are definitely worth the price."
5,PURE PUNK-CRUE!!!,"When Motley Crue was recording this album I bet they didn't know what they were doing and what they were doing was a classic rock album that usually you don't on any band (not even punk bands). The high-point on the album is Mick Mars on the guitar. A lot of people spend most of their life getting this crunchy sound and they can't get it. Steve Vai can be a ""virtuoso"" on the guitar and Joe Satriani can show us all the scales in the world, but the sound on the guitar of this record is like a drill directly to your brain.I have bought this album like 3 or 4 times (I used it so many times that end up like an old pair of sneakers) and if I need to buy it one more time I'll buy it again as many times as I need to get this songs. I mean, living a life and don't hear LIVE WIRE, TOO FAST FOR LOVE, PUBLIC ENEMY #1, MERRY GO ROUND, ON WITH THE SHOW and the rest of the songs it's NO living at all.Do you travel a lot on your car??? Get this one. Not ONE song is bad."
2,Reviewed too quickly .. CD was scratched,"Well I am sorry to say that this CD was scratched even after I cleaned it thinking I had removed the scratches and it was no longer going to skip. I don't want to write a bad review, but when you buy a used CD, it should not be scratched and the seller should have checked it out first and at least said it was scratched. And it was not just one song, three songs could not be played because it was so scratched. I will not return it because I paid $8 and the refund would be $6 without calculating shipping and the hassel. So all in all I got a used CD that I can listen to most of the songs as long as I upload the CD to itunes and delete the bad songs."
3,The most popular demo in the world,"If you're looking for polish, look away now. Too Fast for Love is one of the dodgiest recordings ever to make it into legend. It's got it all, bad production, grotesque reverb washing over everything and even out of tune guitars.The good news? It's a legendary piece of work from the LA bad boys. Da Crue made a fine opening statement with Too Fast... and the overall feeling is one of discovery, like you've just stumbled across something ugly but which you still find strangely fascinating. Enjoy, but be aware of what you're getting."
4,This album rocks!!!,"TOO FAST FOR LOVE, by MOTLEY CRUE was their first album they released and they did it without any help from any of the major record companies at the time. This album has all the elements that would later go on to become part of the trademark Motley sound, sex, drugs and of course living a great lifestyle. Now that it has be remastered and re-released with bonus tracks, I highly recommend this for all you Motley fans and for any music fans at all. There are some killer trakcs on this album: TOO FAST FOR LOVE, LIVE WIRE, STARRY EYES, and PIECE OF YOUR ACTION are what I think are the standout tracks here. We also get to previously unreleased tracks that I think totally rock, TOAST OF THE TOWN and an alternate intro to TOO FAST FOR LOVE. This album has great music, killer songs and a killer attitude and I think all rock fans should enjoy this"
5,"Early, Raw, 80s Hard Rock... Perfect!","If you own and like ""Shout at the Devil"", and you don't have this album, then SLAP yourself in the face twice and then GET IT NOW!! Nothing else really needs to be said, except that these two albums are without a doubt Motley Crues' best material to date, and it's a toss up as to which of these is better. Certainly less polished than their later works, but THAT'S what makes it so great!! Very original, raw, and ""garage-band"" sound... trust me... you'll play it over and over and over and over again!!"
5,Take Me To The Top!,"the only Crue album that i own and for good reason! on Too Fast For Love, the band sounds raw, crazed, and hungry! in other words...unstoppable! this is a classic album full of hot-blooded songs that rock with more of a trashy glam strut than a heavy metal vibe. owing more to New York Dolls than most of their contemporaries, the songs and the style are all killer. production is really raw and sounds like they might have recorded these in a garage, but that's what i like about it...very young and adolescent sounding. the drumming has some really peculiar production techniques applied to it...(just why is that overdubbed cowbell so loud? haha!), but in the end, the strange production adds a nice touch to it...a unique kind of gonzo charm. i like it. the bonus tracks on here are all pretty good but only their version of ""Tonight"" (originally peformed by The Rasberries) stands out as something truly special. great cd!"
2,Too bad for love,"Before Motley signed with a major label, they recorded an amazing album called Too fast for love.Yes this one!Only the record company made them re-record the whole thing and it just doesn't work.Maybe it's because I am so used to the original version of the album that I am so disappointed in this one but really they should have stick to the REAL too fast for love.On this cd the mix is pityful, poor, the band doesn't have half the energy they had on the previous one.What a shame...the songs on too fast are some of the greatest CRUE compositions:Live Wire, Too FASt, On with the show...An explosion of glam/punk/metal!At least on this specific release, they had the descency to put the entire album-Stick to your guns appearing here as a bonus was originally the single to be but was cut from the re-recorded LP.It still is a great album but I will never understand why they needed to re-record it."
2,Started to fail within one year,"I purchased this item less than one year ago, but not through Amazon, and I never sent in the warrantee paperwork. However, it began to fail within 9 months of use. We get ice cubes, but not enough to fill a glass. WE will have to get rid of this machine and replace it with another. We had the Haier for many years before it failed, but it is temporarily out of stock. As soon as it comes back, I'm ordering another. We use this in our dental office for our employees, and although it was inexpensive, it was still too costly for the length of time it performed. It didn't make ice as quickly as the Haier did."
2,Portable Ice Maker,"In the past 12 months I purchased an EdgeStar IP210 Ice Maker.After 3 weeks of use I had to send it back and was out for a couple of weeks.The company sent me a new machine, I used it for 11 months as per instructions and it quit.The company sent me different tests than what were in the instruction manual. Their trouble shooting tips did not work either.The company said I could get a Technician to repair the unit or send it too them at my expense and they would fix it. At my expense. I had a different unit and the repair for the unit was three times what I paid for the unit.I guess you get what you pay for."
2,Break after one year,I have had three of this model ice maker. When this ice machine isn't broken it does one bang up job. After a year though the plastic piece at the top of the unit that moves gets a crack and the thing stops working. Like I said I have had 3 and they all broke in the same place. I also gave 2 as gifts and they broke in the exact same place. This time I am going to see if a small appliance man can glue it back together. It is such a shame that it is defective because when it works it is great.
3,Disappointed,"This item is big, but not unattractive; however, it does not deliver on its promises. Perhaps I'm not doing something correctly, but it has never made ice in under an hour and the cubes all stick together so that you have to bag them and beat them to separate them. If it weren't such a hassle, I'd send it back."
2,I am dissapointed with the design,"This device concept is excellent. However, the designers could have made it easier to clean when mold began to grow! Yes, mold grew even though we used bottled/purified water! Along with the mold issues we encountered, the system never really made good cubes. They were always soft, and melted qiuckly."
1,"Stopped making ice, too slow","We bought 3 of these for all our offices. They make ice much slower than they claim to, and now after a little less than a year they all stopped making ice altogether. The fan seems to still run, but it's just not making anything on the prongs, as if its not getting cold."
1,Makes Ice Fast But Not Very durable,"We received this unit for Christmas about a year ago. My sister-in-law also received one. Hers went out in about 3 months. We assumed that it was because of the kids (blame it on the kids!!!) Last week our went out also, when I was figuring out what happened, hoping to fix it, it was the same problem as with my sisters. The tray that the ice is made in cracked at the hinge area. This caused the water to leak out, so there was not enough water to make the ice. One accurance is a problem, two is a product defect. Now we have no ice and a looking for another unit. My advice is to pass by this unit, there are others out there."
2,Don't Bother!,"When it actually works it's fine, but it will break at least once per year. The ice case in these are defective and crack at the hinge, when this happens no ice is produced. Customer service will not help you if the product is out of the 1 year warranty, even though their product is faulty."
2,Leaking ice maker,Ice maker works fine. Very poor instructions on drain plug. A little insert that you think is part of packing is part of the drain plug. I threw it away. My bad.Ice maker leaked every time we used it. Customer service would not send a new one for free. They wanted $18.00.I cut off the end of a golf tee to stop the leak. Works leak free now.
4,4 in one,"I had read the first book from this set at the library. I was looking to purchase them all and this book came through. All of the stories are great. They have a good plot, with a good amount of suspense. I like how Blackstock uses the 'stars' of all 4 books in the set to help each other within the series. If you enjoy other suspense {mystery} novels I highly recommend this read."
3,Product had no specifications,"The PBT 200 had no product description for operating ranges. This only tests up to 900 CCA which many batteries exceed. For only $20 more, the PBT 300 has a much wider testing range. No fault of Amazon, the test specs are not even on the Midtronics website. This is an ok product, but the PBT 300 is an all around better product because of its wider testing capabilities."
4,Very good text book of immunology,"I found this a very suitable text for the teaching of entry-level immunology as it is very clearly written and also amply illustrated with excellent graphics and flow diagrams. It has been a very well received set text (adopted since 1999) for the two immunology modules that we teach in our polytechnic diploma course in medical laboratory technology. My students, in particular, very much like the short summaries which are in point form for easy revision. One possible drawback is a missing chapter on commonly used techniques in diagnostic immunology - whilst this book is not intended as a manual of laboratory methods, we would have loved to read about the various principles & applications, explained in the authors' succinct style, thus making it a comprehensive text."
2,Disappointed,"I heard a few clips of this album on the radio and the clips were pretty hilarious. But the album on the whole is awful. The majority of the tracks are from a live performance, and the levels are mixed horribly. I am constantly fumbling with my volume knob. You can barely make out the vocals, and what you do hear is muffled and unintelligible. It is extremely disappointing. There was a lot of potential here and I expected much more. If the vocal track from the show was clear, this album would have kicked butt."
1,very low level product,"product quality is very low - gave it as a gift and later when asked, it was dumped as the screen and voice quality is poor"
2,Hmmmmmm,An affordable product but the hardware seems a bit flimsy and one is not encouraged to use it very often if at all.
1,A piece of junk,The screen is fragile. It cracked easily just being carried in a fanny pack.The volume is totally inadequate; it's hard to hear the music.The controls are not intuitive and are cumbersome.My recommendation: DO NOT BUY
3,It is what it is,"Not terrible for what i paid for it, i use it in my car on the aux port. It is an mp3 player that if stolen i wont cry about. Yes the sandisk one is better, i got that for my teenage daugter to use at the gym, but this was simple, cheap and in my opinion disposable."
1,Junk,MachSpeed is a piece of junk. Operation is very clunky. Buy a SanDisk instead. This product is extremely over priced.
1,Very dissatisfied,"Neither one worked I sent them back to tiger direct, Now they'er saying that they didn't recieve them. My sons were really looking forward to them.I'm a single parent, and that is all my son's got for christmas.So now you may as well say that they didn,t get anything for Christmas.Thanks to tiger direct."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Just bought this from Fry's 6 hours ago and have already returned it!Played one song, then crashed. Wouldn't play after that.Oh, and this is to be expected: Instructions with the product give you the protocol about what to do when it freezes!!!!!Good luck if you buy this!"
2,"good, but not at all",when you buy 1gb memory u espect at least listen the 1gb with 1 battery charge but not with this one because only work 4 hours wih 1 charge.......so good product but the price and features but really bad with time battery
3,"Works ok, but too big","This case is ok and does the job fine. But if I didn't have to buy a case in a pinch, I would not have selected this one, as it is too big and hence represents some problems. But if you have a large bag or are desperate (like I was), it is a fairly good value for the $.Good:* Strong case w/ wheels* Lots of room for a big bag, shoes and plenty more* Locks work good (I have had no issues with the locks, unlike other comments)* You can take it apart easily to mitigate the large size in the rental car and storageThe Bad:* It is very large (especially wide) and on the heavy side, both of which can be a pain for travel* Weight at check-in can be an issue (over 50 lbs = $25+ fee at most airlines). This basically takes away from the extra space- don't pack too much.* The case stands out. This could be a security issue, as a potential thief could (mistakenly) believe this nice case contains expensive clubs. Also, I hear lots of comments and jokes about my golf bag ""rocket ship""."
2,Locks fail and bag no longer locks,Has 4 locks in which where it locks into failed (plastic cracked/tore)My guess is that it was caused when the TSA inspected (they are not bright enough to figure how to open it) Have pro staff bag (fits wonderfully) but now the bag does not lock properly and when bag comes out - a lock or two are open and your hoping that you did not lose something. Bag going in garbage and buying SKB 1649W it says TSA approved - hoping that means they know how to open the lock and they don't destroy the new carry bag as well.
5,Power pop for the 00's,"I saw this band on Spin City last year, found their website and finally got their first album today. It was well worth the wait.Really no duds in the whole batch. ""Everybody Gets What They Deserve"" is the track from Spin City. Gotta love the Byrds guitars and the infectious chorus. From the beautiful harmonies I'd heard before, I was a little surprised at some of the heavier guitar stuff sprinkled throughout the record but Wow what guitar sounds.This band excels at catchy, tight pop songs with indelible hooks. Check out ""Beautiful (Coulda Woulda), the Beatlesy ""Cars,"" ""Wrong Side Of Bed,"" the rocker ""Maybe Make Me Okay"" and ""Everybody Gets What They Deserve."""
5,Love this band!!!,Got this album and have not stopped playing it. These people are such talented musicians. I absolutely love this music and we continue to play over and over--still love it!!
5,An unforgettable book from my childhood!,"I searched high and low for this book, and the only copy I could find would have cost $250 because it was out of print. I was just searching different things, and came across this reissue. I am so excited!!! Even though my daughter is 12, and maybe a little old for the book, I am certainly going to buy a copy and share it with her. I can remember reading this book over and over as a child, entering Twig's magical world. I feel like I have hit the lottery today!"
5,Twig,I read this book as a child and enjoyed it very much. I purchased it for two of my grand daughters. I hope they will enjoy Twig as much as I did as a child.
4,A delightful tale full of giggles and imagination,"I read this book aloud to my daughters at ages 4 and 5. While the tone of the book is a bit dated, it is still a delightful tale full of magic and imagination, silly names and sillier expressions that sent my girls into giggles every other page. It was a fun book to read aloud and especially fun that it induced so much laughter. The girls are off pretending they are Twig and Elf and making up stories that include all these characters. And the story ends with valuable messages: beauty is on the inside and it doesn't matter how old and plain your dress is, and that you can make your own magic by using your imagination. I did find some of the dialog to be tedious and repetitive but sometimes it had its charm. I would not consider this a great classic, worth of 5 stars so I'm only giving it 4. But it is worth the read and is a good one for younger kids just starting chapter books. Pictures happen on most pages and are sweet and add to the story."
5,A Necessary Resource for Parents of Kids Having Difficulty,"Dr. Silver's book provides easily understood explanations of learning disabilities, attention disorders, and related emotional/psychological problems. This is a good book to get when you are just beginning to learn or suspect that your child is having problems at school because it gives a good overview of various disabilities, explains the special ed process, and encourages parents to become their child's most effective advocate. I particularly appreciate Dr. Silver's empathy and respect for our kids -- he reminds parents how hard the kids with differences have to work and how much they want to get things right. All in all, when I finished this book I had enough information to start asking questions at school and lots of hope and determination that my child would get the necessary help."
5,The Misunderstood Child,I found this book to be extremely helpful in explaining all aspects of ADHD. I highly recommend this book to anyone wanting information regarding ADHD and how children are tested.
1,"Great songs, great voice, lousy recording","Susana Rinaldi is a fabulous tango singer -maybe nobody can transmit the melancoly of tango songs like she does. I first learned of her after my father visited Buenos Aires in 1981, and ever since I have felt a sort of admiring reverence for her deliciously sad interpretations.I bought this disk with great expectations, but regretably the recording is just not of great quality, in terms of acoustics. Through the noise of poor acoustics I can still hear Susana Rinaldi's great interpretative powers, and the songs are great -but what a letdown to feel like a cloud of fog separates me from fully appreciating the song. Can't figure out why they wouldn't do a proper, professional recording for this."
2,Reina de Corazones,A great artist but only 6 tracks on this DVD. The advertising suggest 13 so beware.
4,Good Book,"I really like COBOL. It is a shame that it is no longer used much. For reporting programs, it is more user-friendly, than C, C++, etc."
1,Too Small!,This armband is for anorexics. My arms are by no means over-sized and I had to pay someone to do an extension.
4,Pretty Good...,"I like just about everything about this armband except that the strap is difficult to insert through the loop. Also, I have pretty small arms, and it seems like if I had a lot bigger arms, this wouldn't fit well. These are minor issues for me though I use it for running, and so far, I like it a lot!!"
3,Does the job,"For what it costs, it is definitely worth it. If you are a woman or a man under the weight of 185# then this is definitely the armband for you. No extras here. No wire holder and it's not made of awesome stuff. If your on the slim side and don't want to spend a bundle then this is the way to go. Does what it should, but if you are over 200# or have medium to medium large arms, then it won't work for you."
3,get's the job done,"This armband is nice, it holds in place well, depending on how tight you like it, and it becomes unnoticeable during workouts. This item is not good for upper body weightlifting, as the biceps expand and its annoying to keep moving the headset wires out of the face when doing bench. If you like cardio tho, this is good for you. I heard that a ipod belt is better for weightlifters, I don't know tho."
2,Not very usefull for working out,I bought this armband to use at the gym. Its well designed as far as being able to access the Ipod controls and ports. There are two major flaws however that make this product pretty much useless.1) The armband doesn't stretch. Once you tighten the armband to where it will stay on comfortably there is no way for the band to stretch if your muscles expand during a workout. This might not be an issue for someone jogging but if you are lifting weights it makes things really uncomfortable as it constricts you arm. It also puts a lot of stress on the band causing it to rip.2) The material it is made out of tears easily. I bought this band a month ago or so and it is absolutely shredded. I do work out pretty hard but its ridiculous how ripped up this band has become. I have one or two workouts left until my Ipod flies out of the band.
4,Pretty Decent,"I have an 80 gig Ipod and I used this product for the last few months. The armband worked pretty well, especially compared with most of the crappy (and more expensive) products that seem to be all that is available for those of us with larger ipods. I have no complaints except that after many weeks of running long distance with it, the velcro band broke off flinging my lovely ipod into the road. I wish I had broken it doing bicep curls or something so I could at least feel like a badarse. That being said, it is very functional and is so darn cheap that I am ordering another one."
4,"Simple, Sturdy, and Cheap","What more do I need to say beyond my title? I'm very impressed with this armband. It's comfortable, and it does the trick at the gym or out running. It's a little tough to spin the clickwheel through the plastic, but I think I just need more practice."
3,Reasonably priced iPod armband has quality issues,"I decided to purchase one of these armbands after reading several favorable reviews about this product. I do think it is a decent product but it does have some quality issues. I was frustrated because the stitching on the armband broke off when I was doing pull-ups the first time I used it.I thought that my experience might have been a fluke and so I ordered another armband. This time I did not tighten is so much on my arm and it has held up much longer (I've had the armband for about 3 months). However, the stitching is starting to come out and so I'll probably end up trying a Belkin armband now since I don't want to order a 3rd armband.One frustrating thing about this armband is that the exposed velcro constantly snags the material on the jerseys that I work out in and it has seriously marred my jersey. I guess you get what you pay for!"
2,Not Big Enough... :-(,"I bought this item because after reading the reviews I figured it was the biggest Ipod armband I could get. I was sadly mistaken. When I recieved it the first time I put it on the flap that held the buckle on ripped because it was too tight. I never actually got a chance to use the product. My arms are slightly larger than average (17""). I am sure it would be good for those whose arm are medium sized."
5,Samsung DVD/VCR V8500,Works wonderful. Do not sit anything on top of the machine for it will hinder its working ability.
1,Will it work today?,"I've had this item for less than a year, and already it has problems reading some brand new bought CD's as well as most burned CD-R's. The same CD's and CD-R's work fine on my computer and in other players. After having the problem, I tried a cleaning disk but that didn't make any difference, and I'm really doubtful that is the issue.It seems more likely that this is just a poor product and I got gipped.Further, I was very disappointed that although it ""claims"" to be a Super VHS player, it doesn't support SVideo output for the VCR (nor composite).Unlike another reviewer, I am able to get the RCA video out to work with the VCR function."
1,Stay away from this junk,"This thing's DVD player quit on me in the first few weeks. I returned it for repairs, had to pay the shipping. Came back and worked OK for 3 more months and the DVD player quit again. VCR seemed to work fine. The DVD player quality is not good even with component video cables. I recommend not buying this trash. Right now a rental DVD is stuck in this player and i am trying to get it out."
2,DVD failed after 8 months,"After about 8 months this unit simply refused to play any DVDs although it will still play audio CDs and VCR tapes. The customer support at Samsung, once I found the right phone number, was very polite and helpful and with the 1 year warranty we're able to send the unit in for repair... although labor and shipping is not covered under the warranty and will end up costing us over 1/3 the product price to get it repaired. Aside from the premature failure the unit did perform acceptably and remote control was easy to program and use with our television from a different manufacturer. However, considering the failure and the cost of repair I don't see us purchasing anything from Samsung in the near future."
2,Not a fan of this one,"The VCR side works fine but I rarely need to use it. The DVD player stinks. Half of my movies aren't recognized by the player, some of them won't go past the menu screen, often it freezes and skips (not fun in the middle of a TaeBo workout LOL) and it won't play any of my DVDs made on the computer. All of these things work perfectly in other players. As soon as I convince my husband that the player is defective and it's not the DVDs as he thinks, we will return it and get a different brand."
3,Samsung DVD/VCR Combo,"I found this product fairly easy to use. However, the remote is not compatible with my tv (JVC). So, I will need to use 2 separate remotes."
3,clicking noise,"I have noticed that when I am recording a tv show or playing a vhs tape, there is a steady ""click"" that is annoying. I have since read other reviews and I read that someone else was also having the same problem. Otherwise, the equipment is user friendly and I do like it, but simply cannot stand the clicking noise. I understand that I cannot return or exchange it with your company. I have called tech support 2 times and they told me to contact me. What in the world should i do now??????"
3,"Entertaining and Educational, But Hard to Use","The stories in this book are great. They remind me of the Paul Harvey ""and now for the rest of the story"". But my gripes. The stories are not chronilogical, which would be fine if there were an index, which there isn't. The Table of Contents lists the title of story, which in no way gives you a clue as to who the story is about. There is at the back of the book a list titled ""Who they were, what they were, where they lived"", but not a ""where to find them in this book"".In order to use this book in our homeschooling I had to read the entire thing and make my own index. Which was a pleasure, but seems kindof odd that I had to."
