3,Sickened,"This was a very interesting book. I wish the author had included a little more detail of how she pulled herself together, how she discovered fruit and vegtables (vice fixing chocolate cake batter for breakfast) I would also have appreciated knowing how she persuaded the child protective services in Montanna of the truth of her mother's 2nd round of ""Munchausen by Proxy"" with her 2nd family and foster children."
2,Sickened with the Style,"Ok, I was expecting to read an account of a woman's terrifying experience as a victim of MBP. It's in there but it's written in a flowery style which takes away from the brutal reality of the situation. One wonders, how are these long conversations between doctors, parents, and children remembered verbatim from 20 years ago?"
4,Fair for the price,"Noise cancellation is adequate considering the price.Positives:Handy retractable cordDecent battery lifeComfortableNegativesNoise cancellation uneven between earcupsThis is the second pair of these headphones I have tried. I returned the first pair because it seemed as though the cancellation was not equal on the left side. I even flipped the phones around and sure enough, one side sounded different. My second pair behaved in the same way and I concluded that the microphone on the top of the earcup must have been obstructed by the headband.Overall, a good entry level setup however my next purchase will be the Sennheiser PXC 250. They offer better cancellation abilities and music reproduction. Or, if you really wish to go all out, there are the Bose. . ."
4,Useful Headphones,"I bought these headphones to muffle the noise of a power lawn mower so I can listen to my walkman while mowing the lawn. They don't eliminate the engine noise completely by any stretch of the imagination, but they muffle the sound sufficiently so that I can have the walkman at a reasonable volume level."
5,Excellent Product,"If you don't have the money for the Bose Technology, don't feel bad. These headphones will do a beautiful job canceling even household sounds. My humidifier sounds like a plane taking off, but with these phones on, the sound is not at all noticeable. My roommate plays the tv so loud it's like being in the theater, again these make a peaceful atmosphere; as I substitute my own tunes. Your audio player will sound great too. I don't think you could find anything in this price range that could come close to the technology offered in this set. They fit snugly and fold up easily into their own bag. A real buy at this price, I am ordering a second one as a gift."
1,REALLY uncomfortable!,"Though the sound quality and noise cancelling of these headphones are fine, other reviewers were not exaggerating when they said they are poorly designed and uncomfortable. Problems: 1) They squeeze your head like a vise. 2)The ear cups are tiny, made for elfin ears 3) The top part is hard, austere plastic that digs into your scalp.If JVC improves these headphones and makes some slight attempt to make them comfortable and wearable for a normal person they will be a good product. Till then I don't recommend buying them unless you have a tiny head, tiny ears and no sensation on the top of your head."
2,Disappointing performance,Maybe my expectation was too high. I wasn't impressed at all by its noise reduction performance during the flight from Boston to Denver on B-737.I'll try a brand new battery on the next flight.Up-date:I tried it again with a brand new AAA battery; flight from Logan to BWI on B-717. Noise reduction only slightly better than the last time. It seems that the noise reduction frequency band is too narrow (low frequency only).
1,JVC HANC100,"Although it is a comfortable headphone to wear, one speaker failed after two weeks. It is totally unacceptable."
3,You get what you pay for,"My hopes for this unit were too high, I'm afraid. Noise cancellation is mediocre; it's somewhat OK with very low-frequency sounds (i.e. busses, planes), but next-to-worthless with anything higher. The earcups block more sound than the actual active noise-cancelling feature. Fidelity is likewise somewhat OK, but no better. I also found the headphones a little uncomfortable for more than an hour's wear. No pad for the top of the head."
4,"Great Quality, Good Comfort (Small Cups)!","As someone else has said, the only drawback are the small cups or pads that don't go ""around"" your ear. I'm guessing that it is designed for size as well as comfort. These have been amazing on many Overseas trips that I have taken and going from Madrid to Vienna often.Unless you see something else that must be better, this one is a good bet."
3,Mediocre noise cancelling but great sound,My title says it all. These are good headphones with good sound quality. Noise cancelling is there but not enough. I am not sure how these would compare with a Bose for example.Headphones are not padded and they can begin to hurt the head if worn for too long.
4,My husband loves them,I bought these for my husband and he loves them. They fold up and fit in his briefcase for traveling. Sound quality is great.
1,"Good Sound, Terrible Design","The sound of these headphones is quite good for the price. But they are among the most uncomfortable headphones I have ever tried! Unlike even less expensive headphones these have nothing to go between your head and a hard, sharp plastic tab in the middle of the headband. I will try to post a photo of this fatal flaw so potential buyers can make a better choice."
2,"Cancellation is OK, comfort so-so, human factors so-so","The noise cancellation on these headphones helps, but is far from perfect. I have not used more expensive noise-cancelling headphones for extended periods, so maybe this is as good as it gets.The headhones are generally comfortable unless you are bald. The hinge in the middle of the top rubs against the top of my head. May not be a problem if you have a lot of hair.The human factors is not too good. The retractable cord is a great idea, but it doesn't work reliably, the rewind slider is difficult to work (it sticks and is in an awkward place), and it gets hidden underneath the support flange. Why not a simple button right next to the cord?I guess you get what you pay for. These were a gift. I probably would have bought something of better quality."
3,Good value,"These work pretty well for the money, but are a far cry from the level of comfort and noise reduction you'll find in the Bose headphones. But, remember, these list for about 1/3 of the Bose headphones and sell for about 1/6. All in all, a whole lot better than cranking up my earbuds and destroying my ears when I'm on a plane."
3,They were good while they lasted,Sound quality good. Comfort great. Poooooooooooooorly built. If you are thinking of buying them for travel think again. They are poorly built and don't hold together when you sleep against them. May be my fault but when you are on an airplane there is very little place to go. It does give a decent battery life and decent noise canceling.
3,JVC Noice Cancelling Headphones.,"Firstly the noise cancelling is not real good. The headphone band was too tight for comfort,and I did not like the floppy folding,which did not lock into place. The general sound was very good. but was not what I was looking for. I live near an Air Force runway with fighter jets etc. taking off frequently.These did nothing for me. I sent them to my daughter to use when flying."
1,worthless,"These headphones are simply trash. I've had them for 6 months. The input jack on the headphones themselves(the wire is removable) went bad almost immediately. I have to wiggle the wire around in it's jack EVERY time I use the headphones. They are uncomfortable. I cannot listen to more than one album without pain. The noise cancellation is trash. There is one category of sound that these headphones will cancel: low rumble. If you would like to eliminate or reduce any other frequency, you are out of luck with these. I work in a noisy environment with all manner of noises. This decorative head garbage cancels out ONE of those sounds: the air conditioner. Buy something else."
1,Miserable noise cancelling headphones,"I guess these headphones fall into the catagory of ""rip-off."" The noise cancelling is minimal and I do mean MININAL....plus they are the most uncomfortable headset that I have ever worn. In a word....BEWARE!!!"
4,There is a trick to the retract mechanism,"I received these headphones as a gift and they are the first noise-canceling headphones I have used. I use them at my desk to cancel out the fan noise from my computer. For this purpose they work well. I put them on, flip the power switch, and the fan noise disappears like magic. I often wear them for more than an hour at a time and I find the discomfort to be minimal. If you find most over-ear head phones uncomfortable, you will likely find these to be uncomfortable.After fighting with the retract mechanism the first few times I used it, I discovered the secret to easily retract them every time. The retract mechanism will not work while you are wearing the headphones or while the ear cup is up with the hinge extended. Simply rotate the cup downward and the switch for the retract mechanism operates easily.I think these are worth the price and am considering purchasing a second pair to use at work."
3,Save for something better,the noise canceling on an airplane only made it so i could hear my music without having to bleed my eardrums but it doesn't really cancel out that much airplane rumble. also the small ear cups and this notch in the top where it folds gets really uncomfortable. You cant wear these for more then an hour unless you have small ears. Id say wait and save up to by some with better noise reduction quality. The sound is decent. Reviews say the quality is good for the price but the quality isn't good. Id say wait and save up to by some with better noise reduction quality. I just bought some audio technica quiet point headphones ($120) which i have heard rival the well known bose quiet comfort series($250-$350).
3,"noise canceling noise as loud as the real noise, returning it now.","the major complain I have is the white noise from the noise canceling circuits. It is as much as the noise from my computer, which is above average loud plus the background noise. I don't feel it reduces the noise, it is more like substitute many noises by another noise.I had a chance on plane to test the headphone last week. It was almost useless. On a jet plane, it reduced the noise by just physically put the earcup on, but noise cancelling gave almost as loud noise as you hear after the damping from earcup, the only advantage is that the white noise is more pleasant than the jet noise. On the turbo plane, it was a disaster, it actually increased the noise from turbo, supposedly of higher frequency.I am returning it. Don't waste your shipping money on that.the pro is the retractable cord, but soundwise, not worthy it.I wanted to change the rating to 2, but it won't let me."
1,Did not perform as advertised.,"I returned the JVC HANC100 Noise Cancelling Headphones within a week of my purchase. The noise cancelling function only amplified the outside sounds. When using the headphones with my MP3 player, I had to increase the volume to an unacceptable level to hear the music. I have purchased many products from amazon.com and this is the first I have ever returned. I unfortunately can't recommend the JVC HANC100 Noise Cancelling Headphones."
2,Don't waste your money.,I saw these and was intrigued at the compact design and the over the ear fit. When I got these the first problem I had with them was discomfort. They squished too hard on my head even after bending them a bit and also after hours on a plane. The other problem I had was the very top bit hurt the top of my head. I had to tape some foam to make them even wearable. The quality was so so. It sounded a little too far off in my own space and the speaker quality wasn't the best. I've used the Sony MDR-NC6 headphones and would recommend these over the JVC especially now that they cost less.
4,Consider the cost,"Yeah, they're not Bose, but they're also 1/6th of the cost. However, if you're not a daily flier, and want to cut out the worst of the noise on an airplane, these headphones certainly do the job.A marked differential of tone in the left and right channels is a minor annoyance (noted in a previously submitted rating). The unpadded headband is also somewhat uncomfortable, but is offset by their compact size when you fold them up for storage.I wear them for 9 to 10 hours on trans-Atlantic flights once a month (and an ocassional domestic flight) and love the convenience of the retractable cord. They are able to cancel out the worst of the engine noise and general whirs and buzzes of any aircraft. The sound quality and fit comfort are a sight better than the junk that the airlines provide.If you want the best, buy the best (Bose). If you want the best value, good performance, and top convenience, buy the JVC from Amazon."
4,Good headphones,"I like the sound from the headphones, and they do reduce noise a little (lessens the low drone of the airplane or bus). They are comfortable. The cord retracts, which is nice, but it sometimes doesn't work properly and you have to struggle with it a bit. They fold up fairly compactly into a little bag. Also, on my first order, the battery cover was missing and I had to send it back and get a new one -- a hassle."
1,Do not buy,"I purchased these headphones because of their cheap price, alleged noise canceling abilities, and the high customer rating, with the intent of wearing on them on the city bus to and from school with my ipod. They may or may not work on an airplane, but the noise-canceling is poor on the bus. The fan on the bus was 75% blocked out but the low rumbling of the bus engine forced me to turn up the volume anyway. I might have kept these despite the inadequacies but they are perhaps the most uncomfortable pair of headphones i have ever worn. The pain around my ears was noticeable after 15 minutes and unbearable at 30.I do not recommend buying these headphones. If you need more persuasion, the quality of product is extremely low. Its almost expected, for the cheap price, that they would be poorly made, but I'm positive there are better products for the same price available elsewhere."
2,Too cheap,"I've come to enjoy JVC products over the years, but this one comes up short. Though the sound is quite good, and the sound cancelling does a pretty decent job, there are some real quality shortcomings:- I lost the sound in one ear after less than a year; was inside the headphone and not a jack issue and there was no way I could get at it to make a repair. I attribute the problem of a very thin and flimsy cord.- the retractable cord mechanism was a moose to operate, often I had to pry it with a knife or screwdriver to get it working- the battery cover frequently fell offThe phones are also a bit large, though they do fold up somewhat compactly. I only used mine on planes when traveling so I do not feel as though I abused the unit."
3,They're OK,"PROS: sound quality is OK. Price is good. I like the retractable cord.CONS: Noise cancelling is not as much as I would have liked, but I guess for the price it is reasonable. Also, the headphones are a bit uncomfortable, as they fit very tightly."
2,This JVC almost has it right... almost.,"This JVC almost has it right... almost. They fold easily and the retractable cord are great! The sound is very good BUT the most important feature ""noise canceling"" fails dismally and after a hour or more they are uncomfortable. I had the Sony MDR-NC6, but they were stolen and I opted for the JVC on price, the retractable cord and the Amazon reviews. The first time I put them on during a flight I noticed how poorly they did canceling out the noise. The Sony were much better. This is the most important feature and the JVC scores poorly here. I would not buy the JVC again, nor do I recommend the Sony MDR-NC6; they are uncomfortable and a hassle to use. Now, in hind sight, I would pay the extra $$$ and get me a pair of the Audio-Technica ATH-ANC7."
2,Hurts my head and my ears,"I use these for work since I work in an open floor plan and can hear everyone's conversations. In any case, I have headphones on for long periods of time and have found that they really hurt the top of my head after awhile. I tried adjusting them but that never works. As long as they're hanging from my head, they hurt. And the headphones part itself starts to hurt my ears as it presses down on my ear cartilage. It's not like I have huge ears. The sound is fine but if I can't wear these, there's really no point."
4,Good Value & Effective,Well packaged product; works well in airplanes to reduce (not eliminate) the constant buzz from the engines. Good sound quality from my iPod. Very comfortable even on long flights.
3,Good considering the pice.,"These headphones are OK but not great. My particular issue is with the base response. You're not going to get a rich low end with these. However considering the price, they are good headphones. I have not used them in an aircraft yet so can't comment on the noise canceling feature. If you can afford more then think about spending it. JVC makes some great equipment. They probable have world class headphones available."
3,Not the best but good for the price,"I had originally intended to get a higher end product than this but finding out that I needed to buy an additional set for my partner convinced me to scale back the purchase a bit. I specifically bought these for air travel because I have a difficult time listening to movies or music on a plane. For that purpose, the noise cancelling feature works pretty well. You can tell a definite difference between having the feature turned on versus when it is off. If you are getting these headphones to create a little peace and quiet, note that it will not eliminate, or even reduce much, voices, phones ringing, etc. So if you are looking to use these for air travel they are pretty good, not the best, but decent for the price, plus the retractable cord and easily foldable design are a plus as well."
2,ok,I actually was pretty disappointed in these headphones. I thought that they would really do better blocking out sound on a plane. Sound quality is ok.Retractable wire was kind of nice.Save your money for the Bose.
4,great performance at this price,"I have used these headphones for four long distance flights. For the price I paid, they worked great. The battery even survived with over 40 hours of usage.On the downside, they do take a few hours to get use to. I suggest that you rotate the ear pads and try different positions until you find the most comfortable fit.I have also tried the Bose QuietComfort II at the mall and compare with the HANC100, the QuiteComfort II are more comfortable and the ""noise canceling"" is a bit better. If money and product size are no objects, go with the Bose.Recently, I acquired the JVC HN060, thinking the smaller size will be easier to carry, but what a mistake that was. Its noise canceling performance is not even close to HANC100."
1,piece of junk,"save yourself some money and don't buy this. the noise reduction is very minimal and it is extremely unconfortable to ware this. The overhead bridge is not covered and the plastic is very heard, it rubs against your head and after a while it hurts. I returned it."
1,rip off,This item didnt cut the noise at ALL! I had it turned on and was sitting 6' from my TV that was turned on low....I could hear everything as if I had nothing on my ears.
3,JVC Noise Cancelling Headphones,"These headphones are okay, not the best, not the worst. For the money they are a good deal"
3,Not Necessary,"I finally got to try these on an airplane, the purpose for which I purchased them. They do reduce the ambient noise but not as much as I remember the Bose. I had tried the bose on a flight a few years ago. The passenger next to me let me try them on. I was amazed. Not so with the JVC. But maybe I was expecting too much. They did make the DVD I was watching enjoyable and cut down on the noise in the plane. It was a 3.5 hour flight and I kept the headphones did not experience any discomfort that others reported. The sound quality is excellent. All in all if you must have noise cancelling and do not have the bucks for the Bose, get these. Otherwise, get the Sony MDR-EX71SL (or 51's), if you don't mind ear plug type earbuds. They do not have noise cancelling, but the isolation blocks most of the noise (including the passgeners), and are cheaper."
4,Just delightful - Great for travel,"I wanted earphones for travel on an airplane - something with noise cancellation, full ear coverage, and reasonably priced. Bingo! These fold fairly small for full sized phones. My only complaint is the head strap could have used some padding."
5,GER,"i have no complaints about the product, fits well and performs well. Have used it several times on airplanes and been well satisfied for both music and books."
2,Can't hear anything!,I got this headset to use when I mow the lawn so I could listen to music with my IPod Nano. The music sounds pretty good until I start the mower blades and then I don't hear anything. It does cut down the sound of the mower but it also seems to cut the volume level of the ear phones. I can't hear anything. So much for listening to music while I mow.
2,"cool and portable, not confortable","Not confortable. my head hurts after wearing them for 20min because of the pressure.Other than that they are portable and pretty, but i regretted buying them and amazon says that they cannot be returned if they are not defective"
4,Good low priced noise cancelling,"Pros:-Battery Life-Reduces machine noise a lot (jet engines for instance)-Relatively comfortable-Retractable cordCons:-Doesn't reduce typical background noise, such as people talking, muchOverall I am very satisfied with these headphones. Definitely make flying less annoying now that I don't have to deafen myself in order to hear my music. Not as good as some higher priced models, but I paid a quarter the price, so that's expected."
2,Sometimes savings can be costly.,"I though I'd saved a few dollars in this purchase, but it was'nt worth it. The product really has two problems: it does not really cancel outside noise unless your volume is up to eardrum shattering levels and the headset is so uncomfortable that with extensive use a hair loss or scalp injury is most likely. Buy Boss (I wonder if they'll accept a trade in) or make sure you try the product at a dealer's store. So much for internet purchasing."
4,Review of JVC HANC100 Headphones,"For the price, these noise cancelling headphones work just fine. They do not block out all of the noise, but do quite well. They are comfortable, and the sound quality is real good."
2,"Uncomfortable, small ear cups, poor noise cancellation","I use headphones when mowing the lawn. When my Maxell headphones became damaged, I decided to give the JVC model a try.Pros: retractable cord (easy to store, keeps excess cord out of the way); battery/switch built into earcupCons: ""tinny"" sound; poor passive noise deadening (cups too small for my ears); active noise cancellation weak and tends to amplify wind noise; head band uncomfortableI would look for a different model."
5,"Great for the price, nice on long flights","These work great for the price. I'm sure the Bose cancels more noise, but for the price these definitely make long plane flights more enjoyable by taking out some of the engine noise. Included adapter lets you plug them into most current airline entertainment systems."
5,perfect,The sound quality is great(for the price) I really like the cord wind up feature even though is some times takes 2 tries. The noise canceling is good too(ONLY LOW FREQUNCY like all noise canceling headphones) It takes the noise out of riding in a car/plane or fans.
1,OUCH!,These headphones are extremely uncomfortable. I tried them on and cannot imagine wearing them for any length of time. I can't speak to if they work or not because I'm returning them asap.
2,You get what you pay for,"These headphones produce not bad sound quality, but they are not comfortable to wear for more than 30 minutes.Noise canceling works only for low frequencies and in the same time add some noise on high frequencies (i.e. in a quiet room I hear more noise when noise canceling turned on)"
2,Not great.,"I had two major problems with these headphones. The hinge in the center of the headstrap often pinched and pulled my hair. It was also uncomfortable on the top of my head. The other problem is that the cord is too feeble to withstand normal office conditions. I accidentally ran over the cord a few times with my office chair, and now the headphones are completely dead. I will definitely not buy another pair of JVCs."
2,"Nice idea, but not durable enough","I bought these headphones for the retractable cord to use at work. I use them probably 4 hours per day attached to my MP3 player and placed in a smock pocket. After about 6 months one side of the headphones became intermittent. I continued to live with it for a while with the idea that I'd solder a new connector on. After a few more months the noise reduction appears to have died somewhat. I tried to solder on a new connector, but found that the problem existed higher up on the retractable cord making it nearly impossible to repair.Also, my hair kept getting caught in the hinge of the headphones pulling it out on occasion. The comfort level for extended periods of time is not very good either.Next time I'm going with the Maxell NC-II pair that my wife has: cheap, very comfortable and going strong after 3 years."
3,ok...but do not expect great sound or comfort,"I have owned these headphones for three years. At first I used them for business travel, but that did not last for long. Now, I use them for home use.Pros:1. Comfortable earmuffs.2. Okay/bad sound quality compared to Bose/Sennheiser; great sound quality compared to cheap earbuds.3. Nice retractable cord.4. Noise cancelling works well in car road trips, Amtrak trains, or quiet office/den (but only for an hour...)Cons:1. After about an hour, the top of the headphones hurts your head (hence, not a good thing for the airplane). I recommend another pair if you will be wearing these for longer than an hour. The plastic hurts over time.2. Noise-cancelling does not work in these areas: airplane, gym, subway."
3,headphones from JVC review,"These headphones are comfortable, but one of the plastic covers to the battery case keeps falling off. Noice cancelling is OK; retractable cord is best feature."
3,Decent audio and comfortable but hissy in a quiet environment.,"These are good phones to use in a noisy environment. If it's quiet, the hiss from the noice cancelling circuit is very noticable and annoying. The built-in cord reel is convenient."
3,"OK, but there is a hiss","My review mirrors what others have said about the good points - you can actually listen to classical music and jazz on the place, easy retractable cord, fits easy on the head and folds well.On the cons, there definitely is a noticeable hiss - I just don't have enough experience to judge whether all other brands in this price range have the same problem.Maybe if I had known this I would have plunked down enough $$ for the Bose. For now, I'm sticking to the JVCs."
1,Uncomfortable Headphones,"The headphones sounded fine, but they were uncomfortable to wear. I have an average sized head and ears, and found the fit much too tight and the ear pads too small. I have owned several other pair of headphones and these are the first that were uncomfortable. I returned them."
2,Bah,"Sure, the noise-cancelling is nice, but the ear cup must have been designed for earless wonders. The cups are at least an inch too small in diameter to be remotely comfortable for use longer than 15 minutes."
2,unwearable,"These things work fine, so long as you wear them. And there's the rub: the earpieces are so small, and they put so much pressure on the outer ear, that the pain became unbearable (at least for me) after an hour or two. They stayed in my brief case for the remainder of the flight to Tokyo, as the airplane noise was, without question, the lesser of the two evils. Maybe this wouldn't have been a problem if my ears were the size of a nine-year-old's..."
3,"Decent, but too small for most adult ears","These headphones do a decent job on noise reduction, so I am pretty happy with that. The retractable wire is awesome and they collapse to a reasonable size for travel. The only issue I have is that the ear cups are too small. Instead of going around your ears, they pin your ears back. They would probably be great for a child under 13, but they just get too uncomfortable for a long trip (they start to hurt after 3 or 4 hours). I should have paid better attention to some of the other reviews I read concerning the ear cups.JVC HANC100 Noise Cancelling Headphones"
2,Mine got ruined quickly,"At first I was very excited about these headphones, mostly because of the comfortable fit and the retractable cord. I really couldn't tell the difference when I had the noise cancelling on, but then I thought, hey, this has a retractable cord, it's worth it. Well, I only have had these headphones for a couple of months, and now the cord is damaged and the sound is terrible, even though I have consciously took good care of these headphones. I think the cord got damaged through, oddly, the retraction system. Well, now I have to throw these away and get a new pair. I'm disappointed, for sure."
3,"Close, but only a cigarette.","It's not an entirely bad product. The sound canceling isn't BAD... but not the greatest. The cups that go around your ear seem to let in more sound then they should and when the sound canceling is activated, there is a slight white noise. The white noise is not at all noticeable when listening to music or drowning out traffic. The actual noise canceling isn't as great as I hoped and the ear cups push pretty tightly on your ears, making them uncomfortable (and even painful) pretty quickly. Until I have the spare time and cash, these are a decent diversion. The best feature of this product is the retractable cord, if you ask me."
4,VERY GOOD PHONES FOR THE PRICE,"These headphones do an effective job of reducing about 70% of the background noise from a tractor, airplane etc. I use them regularly with one of the new little walkman am-fm radios when mowing my pasture. I look forward to seeing how well they do on my next flight."
4,Great JVC product for the price,"I purchased these for my son to use while doing commercial mowing for the city where we live. He has been very pleased with them; both listening quality and noise reduction. His only ""almost"" complaint is that the headphones are ALMOST too small to cover his ears. However, he does not want to go to the larger size, as they are too large. He uses these daily and has absolutely no complaints!"
3,"Good Sound, but not very comfortable","The sound is very good and the noise canceling too, but the ears start hurting badly after a few minutes."
2,disappointing,"I got these phones for use in commercial airplanes and they are a major disappointment. There is a minimal reduction in background noise, but some of this noise is replaced with a hiss. iPod music is barely audible unless turned up to levels that make me fear for my hearing, which is the purpose of the headphones in the first place. In more quiet environments, the hiss is still quite noticable, but the sound is not too bad. In summary, they aren't much better than regular open headphones."
1,Left Earphone Did Not Work Out of the Box,"Terrible, because the left earphone was out when I opened the box. I decided to buy different headphones after returning them."
4,HA HA HA,"I finally figured out why they are called HA's, because when someone asks you ""Are those as good as the Bose ones?"" all you can say is HA HA HA. But seriously folks, subtracting $15 for the noise-canceling ability, you're left with $20-$30 headphones. So they don't sound so good. Pretty lo-fi.As for the noise-canceling ability, it's there. However, mine developed a buzz in the left earcup when it was on, defeating the purpose entirely.As for comfort, hard plastic earcups plus hard plastic band is not a recipe for hours of easy listening.All in all, I would recommend saving your money and spending it on a pair of headphones you can actually live with.Oh, and it won't let me change the four stars I gave them a week after purchase, so just pretend it says two."
4,Great for the price,"Great performance for the price. Sound is good, noise cancelling is good. It's not the most comfortable set but again the price makes it a good choice."
3,"More Comfortable Than Comparable Sony, But...","I have a comparable pair of noise canceling earphones from Sony, but with foam ear pads. These JVCs are more comfortable on the ears, but if you're bald or have a shaved had, they're tend to grate. And I don't hear any more noise canceling than most lower priced models. On the other hand, I do like the retractable cord. Okay, 3.5 stars, and lower my Sony rating by a half star while you're at it. If you forget the noise canceling part and the comfort, they'd both rate a 4 for sound quality."
4,They just work,"I wasn't expecting much from these headphones. I just wanted a little peice and quite at work. Our office space is in an old part of our cigar factory. so they are always drilling, plus we are near train tracks, which you can hear even through the foot thick concrete walls. So I bought these and I have been nothing but amazed! My co-workers are always asking about them. None of them can believe the price! I feel better than the guy who paid over $300 for the Bose!"
4,Satisfied...but not entirely,"Works great in the office cancelling out both my co-workers and inside noise and outside noise (sit by window and building is in the middle of downtown area). But in the car, did not hear any difference. Noise cancelling did not keep out the sounds from outside the car and could barely tell it was on. Have not tried it on a plane. Still, it provides great sound quality for my music without having to blast up the volume."
4,JVC HANC100 Noise Cancelling Headphones,"This is my first experience with buying and using noise cancelling headphones and I don't claim to be an expert at matters concerning audio accessories. The headphones, though, work and function according to my expectations for and understanding of noise cancelling headphones. The retractable, self storing cord for the plug is an added bonus and the comfort adjustments make using them a pleasant experience."
4,Noise cancelling minimum but sound great.,"Used the headphones on a plane recently. The noise cancellation wasn't as good as I had hoped but the sound quality was great. You just have to turn it up a little louder to drown out the majority of the background noise. There's a button to turn on for the noise cancellation which is easy to forgot to turn on and off. Overall, good buy for the price."
3,Not bad,Not a Bose but not some cheap set sold at Checker Auto Parts. For the price it suits me just fine.
4,JVC HANC100 Noise Cancelling Headphones,These are great. The background noise is eliminated when switched on. Even with the noise cancelling switch off the sound is great. These are very comfortable. The wind up cord is real nice. I would buy these before spending a fortune on Bose or other expensive ones.
3,Noise cancelling headphones,"I bought these headphones to work with my laptop computer because I have often listen to audio files. I thought the sound was great and I loved that they were foldable and the cord retracted into one of the earphones, but I didn't find these headphones comfortable. They felt heavy on my ears, making them hurt after a while. I had to return them."
4,Noise Reducer,"This headphones are a great buy for the price. I have used them 5 times in an airplane and they reduce the noise for about 60 to 70 per cent. I tried the expensive brand (200/300 dollars)and the difference is very very minimal. The only drawback I find it is the design. The headphones cups do not fold inward so they are a little bulky. A little tie on the ears but this style of headphones are this way, no matter which brand you purchase. I'm very satisfied with the performance and the price. The delivery was good too."
3,Headphones,"The noise canceling works pretty well. The sound quality is ok. Practically NO bass tones. I like the retractable cord. But, it is about one foot too short. This is really a noise canceling device, with the plug in audio sort of thrown in."
3,"Good, but not great.","Fairly comfortable over ears, but hard plastic touches center of top of my head (doesn't hurt, but not real comfortable). Great retractable cord feature. Folds fairly compactly, but not small enough to fit into a dress coat outer pocket. Blocks low pitch sounds reasonably well, but not as good on high pitch sounds. I use them on the bus every day and can set the volume much lower than I used to on my earphones. Blocks out maybe 50% of the overall noise. For $40, this is a good value. But if you want complete silence, look elsewhere."
5,Clear Static: Unique and Fabulous!,"As previous reviewers have pointed out, there are similarities between Clear Static andother bands who preceded them but that is all. Clear Static, especially live is moreenergetic, frenzied, flamboyant, pouty,sexy and fun than their predecessors.When I saw the ""Make-Up Sex"" video the first time I knew that I wanted to see them live. And I did! They are unique and if they aren't really BIG, I will be shocked.I haven't seen such energy at a show for a long time and fans adore them.In a word: GREAT!"
5,Amazing,"While several people will want to associate Clear Static with bands such as The Killers or The Bravery, they are on an entirely different level. I agree that the original demo of Clear Static was better, but this version is also refreshing and energetic, just like Clear Static. Clear Static captures the prized moments of the 80's, but still has modern elements. This is why they can appeal to the new, young generation, and yet they can also cater to an older generation (fans of Duran Duran, Depeche Mode, and the Cure are included.). All in all, Clear Static will be set apart from other bands (and will rise to the top!)."
3,The Next Big Thing,"Clear Static are The Next Big Thing. Take my word for it. I saw Duran Duran in 1981 and knew they were TNBT a year before MTV figured it out. Clear Static will be stars on that level. Their live shows are Notorious for make up overdoses and the girls crowd in like feeding vampires to try and suck up the energy. The single is an OK start to what will be a long career. MUS is a better song live, and yes they do sound like the Killers, Bravery, Duran, Interpol, Cure, etc., but they are unique and will be making hits for a long time. Buy this single to get a taste of what's to come, then buy the album when it comes out. You won't regret a minute of the time you spend listening to Clear Static."
2,How can anyone think this ISN'T like the killers or the bravery?,"I agree with MrPacDan. This guy SOUNDS very much like all the retro vocalists going around today. Maybe other reviewers have heard more by this band to prove otherwise, but based solely on this single, they are a total killers/bravery knockoff. That would be fine because those bands are awesome, but the song isn't nearly as easy to swallow as those pop/dance masterpieces. If you're into that kind of music and looking for something new, I'd suggest you check out the singles by a band called Protocol."
1,Pathetic.,"Rather ironic that this ""humor"" book recommends what to steal from the Lincoln bedroom, considering that the Clintons really did steal thousands of dollars' worth of things from the White House when they left."
1,It's amazing that it was even published!,"This represents the worst possible reading of Derrida that has, perhaps, ever been allowed in print. He claims that Derrida, de Man, and other deconstructionists want a stable world, and are like children complaining that things are not going their way. I cannot imagine a more incorrect reading. It should be noted that early on in the book he says that he cannot understand Derrida, so the question is: Why is he attempting to make any statement about his work and what it may or may not be after. I am furthered amazed to hear that he was a teacher at Yale.Avoid this book, or better yet, take it upon yourself and read the book and and write another bad review. It is too bad you cannot give zero stars."
3,WARNING: Not Mac Compatible!,"I bought this assuming it would work with a Mac, but it doesn't. The microphone input for a Mac apparently needs to be amplified. I'm now looking for a USB based headset instead.Don't make the same mistake!"
4,great headset!,"I would have given it 5 stars if it was more comfy on my ear. After about 15 minutes of use, I felt too much pain from the earpiece that I had to take it off. That was a big negative for me since I make calls over the internet at least twice daily. The audio was sufficient for my calls and the mic is amazing! The person on the other end could hear everything crisp and clear, without much background noise. You could hear a pin drop!!! Well ok not exactly...but you know what i mean...hehehe"
5,Works Great,Easy to use just plug it in and there u goI am running Windows Vista and had no problems with it
3,"For the Secret Seekers, not the Strategy Seekers","This is a very well written guide for a very good game. When buying this book, keep in mind that there are maps with bubbles that say most of the secrets in the levels. It does not really list too many strategies on how to beat the level. The Ultamite Doom section doesn't even have anything other than secrets, which is a major dissapointment considered most of the harder levels are in the 4th episode. This guide has a few nice resources for other DOOM sites and a Barney Addon explination. One big reason to get this is for the ""you must be a doom fanatic when..."" Buy it if you love doom."
4,maximise your damage,"With the aid of this book, you too can get the inside edge of virtually countless secrets, maps and proiles on just about everything of th game. Warning provides extremely detailed and concise information, and interesting methods on all aspects of the game. There is history, stories and facts that every doom follower should have in this book. I strongly reccommend this book to those followersout there who can see through the great original game and into the great expanse of creativity that was employed in its creation. The profiles, maps and (especially) the stories captivated me. Well worth the investment (particulary if you take interest in the far reaches of the doom universe!)"
1,New formula as of late 2012 - not the same product any more,"I read the label of my most recent bottle and discovered that the amount of many things in it had been drastically cut back compared to the prior bottle. For example, Calcium isn't 1000mg any more, it's 500mg. Vitamin E has gone from 400iu to 30iu. Major bummer, I won't be buying this any more. I'm also emailing the company to complain -- a little yellow band saying it's now soy-free is not adequate notice that everything in it has changed."
1,Should have known better over the counter does not work,I had high hopes this would help with night-sweats after reading positive reviews. This product did not help with my night-sweats or the few hot flashes I experienced during the day.Will not but again or recommend
3,Will I Ever Stop Sweating??,"I am on my fourth bottle of these vitamins and am wondering if they are working for the menopause. It contains all the ingredients that is suppose to help with the ""downpour of sweat"" and maybe it does - I would just hate to see how much more a body could sweat. It does not contain as much ""Black Cohosh"" that is recommended, so I take a Black Cohosh supplement. I have not had any adverse reactions with the combination of minerals, herbs, and vitamins. I will continue to use these and hope that the sweating will end."
5,Rainbow light menopause vitamins,"I had been looking for a product that would have the herbal supplements AND the vitamins and I was delighted to find them in this product. so far, I love this supplement! It was also delivered quickly."
4,Helps with hot flashes,"After taking this supplement for several weeks, I realized I had not been having hot flashes and moods. It is probably helping me in ways I can't think of right now...(hasn't helped with brain fog or perimenopausal acne."
3,I got this to help someone I love who has decided to be Atheist,"I got this to help someone I love who has decided to be Atheist. It has not changed their thinking, a bit disapointing, but I enjoyed the work."
4,Witty Romp through Edmonton,"Ok, so I'm a mystery wimp. I don't like a lot of violence. (...) I want a good story, in an interesting place, with characters who have enough depth that not only do I care what happens to them, I want to know more about them.Janice MacDonald delivers all that in a whodunit with enough twists and turns to keep you wondering right up until the end just how it's all going to turn out. In the meantime, it's fun to run around Edmonton with Randy Craig, whose friends I'd kinda like to have for my own, and whose enemies I'm genuinely glad I don't have to deal with!"
1,"Entitled, Passing Through is one mis-nomer for literal Truth!","After trying for weeks to digeste The Wild Braid as tops, then his Collected Poems of several key periods of writing, I can only agree with the shortest ever review, telling of his unique creative insight to look inside my Personhood! (Pun-Intended)Stanley Kunitz has more than any writer of these past few months including, Karen Armstrong, Fred Buechner, Joan Chittister, Anne Lamott, and Ferrol Sams, Jr. SK has made one totally affective, profoundly life-change upon my writing endeavors! His poems have been handed-off to several friends, who are older, wiser, more gifted writers than I may become! My mistake not give a Perfect--10 Stars! Shalom...Chaplain Fred W. Hood"
2,all elegance but does not deliver what it's expected,"i was intrigued by the design and in the store that i bought it it sounded really nice, but when i got home and took it out, i was dissapointed in the sound quality, it sounds good with low volume but when u turn it up it gets distorted, the speakers cannot take much. At first there's a noticeable squeaking when a cd is playing but thankfully it went away. If looks is what you are looking for then this is the one to get, but performance wise i don't think so."
2,Executive Stereo (Maybe for their companie's Executives...),"Considering this radio comes in a box marked ""Executive Microsystem"" you might expect a little quality. Well, your expectations will not be met...they won't even come close to the poor performance and awful look of this radio. The pictures here don't let you see just how ""China made"" this plastic, molded, seems everywhere stereo is really composed of.I would be estatic if all of Fishers Executives actually had to use this on THEIR desks, I think they would quickly change the design and more so the sound production.I have returned this item and will never by from Fisher again."
2,Stereo's Speaker is apt to go out,"I purchased this system and the right speaker has already gone out with regular use. I purchased this system brand new less than 6 months ago. And, more importantly, I don't know where to have it repaired as Fisher somehow is a part of Sear's now and I am unable to locate the Fisher Company.Antonio L.Hall3334 Blaine Street, NEWashington, DC 20019(202) 396-3959"
3,It's not a bad one,"You Know, some of you said that the sound quality of this system are poor, and your right. But, the looks of it and the price of it force me to give 3 Stars for this Ficher Slim 1500 System.The Bass is not so bad, but it can be better for a Ficher System. The remote control is very complete and some of the fonction, like the ""SureWake"" are very helpful."
1,Don't waste your money!,I bought this item form my daughter for Christmas last year because she thought it looked cool. That's about all it had going for it. The tuner has completely gone out already--we can't get reception anywhere--even outside. I tried buying a new antenna for it and it still won't work. I would definitely steer clear of this item and I think I will stay away from Fisher products in the future.
3,Good for the money,"This stereo looks cool and sounds decent. I have a ""real"" stereo in my livingroom, but I wanted something for the study that wouldn't take up a lot of space and would let me listen to CDs or my computer (it has computer input on the front!) while I work, and this stereo does that for me."
1,Not worth it,"I bought this system thainking we finally had a comparable replacement to the Bang and Olufsen slim stereo but I has horribly disappointed. The sound was horrible - it did not hit any highs or lows so anything besides monoaural sound sounded horrible. Some features did not work logically or did not work at all. Though it is a nice looking system, the quality is too bad to even consider this system. My recommendation - spend for the Bang and Olufsen or just buy a bigger system."
4,Nice System,"I have read through the other reviews and agree with few and disagree with most. Here is how:Disagree: It was said that the CD's wont load or they will skip. I have played 3 different home burned CD's in it in the last hour since I got it, no bad loads, no skips. The sound quality is great as long as you dont want to rattle the windows. It wont let you which I think is a great quality. (No, I'm not old and grey, I'm 21 and loud music is obnoxious). It has a very stylish look, and the plastic looks very nice.Agree: When manually changing tracks, the CD DOES skip the intro to songs. Only real bad thing I have notice thus far. And I have played everything from Country to Classical to Heavy Metal on it now, no problems other than this.I would have to recommend this product. It's not a party system, its a good home stereo that won't have the neighbors calling the police on you."
2,a good short-term stereo,"I had this stereo for about 2 years before it started giving me problems. 2 years after I had purchased it, it stopped playing CD's (even brand new ones straight out of the cases) and it began to skip. It you are looking for a ""short-term"" stereo and a cool look, than this is a great stereo for you. Otherwise, I would advise you to keep looking."
1,Don't buy this stereo,"I needed a slim, unobtrusive stereo for my kitchen and thought this fit the bill. It hangs nicely on the wall, and looks great. Problem is, you can't play CD's in it without having them skip repeatedly. I have tried everything. Store bought CD's, cleaning, carefully loading the system, turning the music down, and nothing has worked. I would strongly suggest you look elsewhere. BTW, had it for about 90 days when this started happening, and if anyone knows where to get it fixed, please post."
2,Over priced storage,Had I seen a zoom version on how this item is made I probably would not have purchased it. It is for my wife so hopefully she'll go easy on it. If it falls apart quickly I'll repost a review and drop this rating even lower.
1,Don't waste your money or time!,"These are a complete waste of money, they are cheaply made and I don't plan to use them... not worth the cost to return. I cannot even believe the use of the term ""fully mechanical"" once assembled you will need a mallet to disassemble them and they don't fold, ""mechanical"" in what way?"
1,You get what you pay for,"I bought four pairs of these brackets to make some inexpensive saw horses to hold material while painting. I wanted something cheap and easy to set up. The cheap thing was a given but I did not expect it to be so wobbly. Also the easy to set up was untrue. Granted it is easy to cut some lumber and screw it together but it took way too much time. Also, after I used the horses a few times, the metal began to bow out and made them even more wobbly.If you are looking for a one time use cheap item, this is it. If you intend to use it as a temporary scaffolding, you better get some good health insurance, since you will going to need it.Frans."
1,Absolute junk,"These brackets do not provide a stable or secure work surface. They are impossible to tighten or adjust. They will collapse with the slightest nudge, creating a serious safety hazard--not to mention damaging your work. I bought a set of these four years ago and can't believe they are still on the market. One of the most poorly designed hardware products I have ever purchased. Amazon should allow for zero stars."
1,Junk,"I bought four of these brackets at a small hardware store where I live. I didn't buy them via Amazon but I felt I needed to give a review since I'm so disappointed. The package that the sawhorse brackets came in say they're made in the USA so I opted for this brand as I like to support workers here at home. Unfortunately, the sawhorse brackets were pretty much unusable. Very difficult to assemble and, once assembled, very wobbly and unstable. The metal used to manufacture these is something about like a tuna can. Also, the instructions should include one step and that would be to get a tetanus shot beforehand. The edges to the various parts are all sharp and will cut you while you toil to put the stupid things together.I strongly advise NOT buying these pieces of junk. Put out a few extra bucks for a good set of brackets or build some sawhorses from scratch using plywood and 2X4's.I give this item a zero-star rating."
1,Complete garbage,"One of the most poorly designed, most flimsy excuses for hardware I have ever seen. They are difficult to assemble and wobbly once tightened. Amazing they are still on the market. Not even worth taking back to the hardware store for a refund."
5,a testament,"I'm glad that these earlier Sub Dub tracks have been made available so every one can see just how groundbreaking this group was. These tracks were made around '95, but sound more creative than pretty much all of the down-tempo/dub coming out today. I can only assume that these guys really kicked off the whole illbient sound in NYC. If you are into this sound, you need this album."
3,This Is Only the First Book,"St. Irenaeus wrote five volumes of Against the Heresies. This is only book one. If you're looking for anything in subsequent volumes (I was looking for material in book 3, for example), you won't get it in this volume. St. Ireneaus is cogent, clear, and brilliant, of course. Just be forewarned that this isn't the entire work."
3,Good but incomplete.,"With Against the Heresies Book I, we have a much needed addition to tha ACW library. This being said, we're still in need of four additional books to complete Against the Heresies. As others have noted, this is only book I of Irenaeus's work. The translation runs smooth and we have a fine primer on early gnostic belief - although I'd hate to think Paulist Press released this book merely to capitalize on the interest in gnosticism in the late 90s early 2000s. One does not actually get around to Irenaeus's theological vision until later in the work (read: the remaining four books yet to be translated for the ACW series).For anyone engaged in serious research of ancient gnostic belief, this volume is a sure companion. If, however, you want to acquire greater ""gnosis"" of proto-orthodox Christian theology (Irenaeus' development of recapitulation is a necessity!), then you may want to look to the reproductions of early translations."
5,Excellent reading,"Fawn Germer does a wonderful job. I read this book in two days...just couldn't put it down. Please, Fawn, write some more! You are a (scholar) of journalism."
5,Wow! I've Needed This Book for 15 Years!,"Finally, a book that doesn't promise some magic formula for success. Instead, the author sought advice from great women like Cokie Roberts, Jane Goodall, the president of Switzerland, basketball champion Teresa Edwards, Pat Schroeder and others. I expected the usual celebrity happy-gush, but instead got a dose of real world wisdom from women who have run many of the same obstacle courses as me. They passed on survival skills that will make my life easier to manage and more rewarding to live. I loved this book."
5,5 Stars For A Tremendous Ending Of A Great Trilogy,"Wow! That's the best way I can describe this book. Kim Murphy has absolutely invaded my time as I read through her trilogy. As I stated earlier, ""This is a love story."" Do not let this keep you from this wonderful Civil War novel. This can be read and enjoyed without reading the first two books, but you will be robbing yourself of the complete story.Murphy will not only introduce you to the characters but will take you entirely through the troubling times of the Civil War and its' aftermath.The mingling of all the characters, their love, their losses,and their personal strengths and weaknesses are wound into a never dull but always intriuging story.This book and the two before it have been a very, very enjoyable ride."
5,Swift Audubon HHS exceedingly clear image,"I did some research and ordered three top-rated binoculars, 8 x 42, in the $300 range. Spent an hour or so outdoors with all three pairs. The Swift Audubon HHS had much crisper and brighter image than either the Nikon Monarch or the Eagle Optics Ranger 8 x 42. As with all things, there are some trade-offs. The Nikon and Eagle models were a few ounces lighter, enough to make a difference in comfort. Both models also have a much closer focus. The Audubon only focusses down to about 9 ft. I really wanted to like the Nikon better because of the weight and the close focus, but in the end the image was so superior in the Audubon HHS that was the choice I made. They're actually 8.5 x 44 and that small increase in magnification does make a difference. I'd been using 10 x 50's and loved the larger image but found them difficult for tracking birds because of the constant need for fine-tuning the focus."
2,Cheap,"I think this fell apart within a day. I thought it would be a good idea, and I think it looks cool, but it is plastic and it doesn't stay together well so it just fell out too quickly. Seller is good, just this particular product is cheap. Thanks!"
5,"Thank you, Dave.","One of the first and best books anyone wishing to begin fly fishing should read. My opinion is that there more than a few people thrashing around with a fly rod who could use the knowledge imparted in this book. It is what the title and subtitle say it is, and well written in an interesting way, and backed with real life examples from the author's fishing career. Guide to the naturals, the patterns, and the presentations. Essential handbook for your approach to the water and food sources for trout.Enjoyed reading this book and will read it again and reference it often, for all the information and techniques that it has to offer. Will not lend my copy to anyone!!!Thank you, Dave."
4,"Hatches yes, flies no","I have only skimmed the book so far, but as a novice/intermediate fly fisherman I had hoped to learn more about catching fish. Good for the entomologist!"
5,Handbook Of Hatches: Introductory Guide to the Foods Trout Eat & the Most Effective Flies to Match Them,This Handbook is an excellent reference that guides the angler through the food matrix to the best fly to use at the moment. Book was in excellent condition...thank you!
3,Has all the info you could possibly need - yon,it has all the facts that you need to be prepared for any hatch but it is pretty dry reading.
4,war stories,A little disappointing in that not much gay activity going on. A boy tries to find out about his dad who is out of the picture. I found the relationship between the dad and his boyfriend a much better short story that we find out about at the very end of the video.
3,GREAT STORY - HORRIBLE ACTING,some of the worst acting i have ever seen!!! there is not one good actor in this whole thing- trust me not one-but what a great plot and story-trust me- there is not one person who can act in the whole movie but is still worth seeing for the plot- elementary school plays have better acting
5,Loved this movie,This was was a well written and superbly directed production that kept me guessing at the outcome until the very end!!!!
2,Disappointed,"I am disappointed in the brevity of the work (on Ecclesiastes). If only the commentary would correspond with the introduction offered, it would be a more useful work to me. It does have exegetical remarks, but not sufficiently so. I have failed to see any sense of useful application offered by the author of the work. The book has a dedication to the Catholic and Lutheran communities they serve, but I would like to think those communities would desire more."
1,These cute little disks STINK! (for a lack of a better word),TWO times have I lost precious information while using the cute colored disks!! I recommend not buying these disks and going with perhaps 3M.And thank you Memorex for wasting my time and money!
1,These disks really do STINK!!!!!,"I bought 1 40 pack of these disks so that I could create a set of Windows 95 setup disks. They worked to install windows once and then they all started dying. I went to run Windows setup and got halfway through and got a ""cannot read from device"" error. After that I ran scandisk on all of them and only 1 disk didnt have bad sectors. A few of the disks had bad sectors in the system area rendering them unformattable. I advise anybody who reads this to steer clear of these cute little disks unless you want to use them as christmas ornaments."
3,Adequate,"The disks are attractive and convenient, but the quality is not high as some of them ceased to work over time."
3,Probably Won't Watch Again,Movie has adventure and humor in it. I would have highly recommended the movie if it would not have promoted Evolution.
1,Awful. Just awful.,"This movie was about an hour too long. Car chases went on and on and on and on. Kids were bored and glad when it ended.Seriously, we rented this because of the 5 star reviews. This is NOT comparable to real 5 star movies like Toy Story or Monsters Inc or Follow Me Boys."
1,One of our Dinosaurs is Missing,I was very disapointed that the copy I received is unusable in the USA. I did not realize that untill I received it. It is my mistake. I thought it was obvious since it was being shipped to the USA that I would get a copy that I could play. I would still love to find a copy that I can play here. It is one of my favorits and would love to share it with my grandchildren. Next time I will red the discription more carefully.
4,My first spanish book,"For my Spanish class, my professor suggested this book. Being my first Spanish book, I really enjoyed it. I recommend this book to any beginning or intermediate spanish studetns. Enjoy!"
4,Want Tolkien's point of view?,"This is a great book by one of the greatest writers ever. It explaines in detail his opinion on certain matters such as how people call stories ""Fairy Tales"" when they are not at all a fairy tale and others of the sort. It is a great addition to any Tolkien fan's collection. It is not as interesting as some of his work so I gave it 4 stars."
4,Dense and learned essays,"Unless you read Anglo-Saxon and Latin (and a little Greek), you will need several readings (and trips to various reference books) to relish fully the very good fruit in 'The Monsters and the Critics' essay by J.R.R. Tolkien. He has a very convoluted sentence structure and writing style that takes some getting used to. Re-reading rewards the faithful reader."
3,So Pretty by Cartier,"Their title says it all. It is a pretty, feminine fragrance that lingers lightly for hours. There doesn't seem a need to refresh the scent too often."
4,most heavy rock from this band,the most heavy rock from this band is like an extremally strong magnetic field ordering your mind when they play and an hour after
5,ROBIN TROWERS EARLY YEARS,"THIS BY FAR IS PROCAL HARUMS BEST RECORDING ,ROBIN TROWER IS JUST INCRIDIBLE .I SAW PROCAL HARUM AT A POP FESTIVLE IN BROWARD COUNTY IN THE EARLY 70S. SONG FOR A DREAMER IS ABOUT JIMI AND ROBIN PROVES HE CAN PLAY JUST LIKE THE GREATEST GUITARIST EVER KNOWN."
5,Great Procol and a killer recording,"Having been in the music and recording business forover 29 years this Procol album has not only killersongs""Simple Sister ""is a totally masterful recording that holds up and surpasses today's digital standards. Youhave remember that this record was made with no computers or digital technology on a 24 track tape recorder!I still listen to the layering on it and wonder how they did itback in '71. Much of the credit should go their producer/ engineer Chris Thomas a true giant in the biz. Chris engineered or produced many great recordings most notably The Beatles, Pink Floyd's "" Dark Side of the Moon"",all the Pretenders records and the list goes on and on.Dave Adams"
4,last harum with robin,Still good! A must for collectors of PH because this was the last real PH disc with Robin Trower. Contains a few duds though. Missing the fullness of sound w/o Matthew Fisher.
5,a true delight,"This may be Procol Harum's finest hour, and trust me, they had a LOT of fine moments in their career (especially from the late 60's all the way up to the mid 70's).""Simple Sister"" might take you by surprise when you find out just how much it ROCKS. Seriously. Those of you who are going into this album expecting more ""Whiter Shade of Pale"" type songs, you'll be in for a surprise! I also love the title track. The band even jams a little bit, which is always a welcome musical idea by me (I LOVE my 70's jams!)""Power Failure"" is a very melodic little song. It's mostly the vocals I remember about it, and it's truly a great little song. ""Song for a Dreamer"" is exactly that- a song for people who like to dream! At first it doesn't seem to go anywhere, but the more you hear it the more enjoyment you are guaranteed to get out of it. You have to free your mind to get into it.Wow, what an album. It's a bit expensive, but worth the price."
4,"Brooker,Trower & Wilson Power Trio","An album overlooked by most turns out to be one of this bands finest. Brooker, Trower and Wilson function as a power trio, playing strong melodies and putting forth tremendous efforts. Production is by the always tasteful Chris Thomas. 5 Brooker compositions along with 3 strong Trower originals make this one of my favorites by this band. Not as fine as A Salty Dog but more consistent than Home. Mobile Fidelity is always topnotch and this one is great. Not a gold CD by the way, but sonically excellent."
2,Bat 6 was a confusing read,"I was hoping for a great read when I picked up ""Bat 6"" in December. I found it hard to follow, because of the jumpy narration (the book is narrated by 21 different girls). However, this book taught a very important lesson about racism and how it affects everyone."
3,Jon's Review,"Bat 6 is a novel that seems to succeed on sheer willpower alone. While many may perceive its primary fault - - a saccharine emphasis on Christianity, the nuclear family, and rural ""good ol' days"" - - as a strength, more enlightened readers will be, in spite of the book's redeeming qualities, distracted by the way in which minorities, both ethnic and philosophical, are treated as an accepted, forgiven ""other"" rather than an equally valid alternative to the mainstream.Furthermore, Wolff's depiction of 1950's race relations is idealized, to say the least, and her episodic format might be too disjointed and confusing for some young readers.That said, Bat 6 is an ambitious novel with a worthwhile agenda, and young readers who are willing to plow through its faults should, with some assistance placing the material in a proper context, find it a rewarding experience."
3,Bat 6,"Bat 6 is told from the point of view of two softball teams from two neighboring towns that play a championship game every year. In 1949 each team had a new player. Aki, who just returned from the internment camps, joined one team, and Shazam, whose father was killed at Pearl Harbor, joined the other. Shazam blamed Aki for killing her father because she was Japanese. At the championship softball game, the hatred came out and a horrific event happened. This book is a very creative story that I liked very much but the pace was a little too slow for my taste. The author also skipped around too much as she went from one girl's view to another's. I would recommend this book to children of ages 10-13 because of the language and the complex story."
5,Its a great book about softball,Bat 6 takes place in two small towns in Oregon. There is a softball game between two schools Barlow Road Grade School and Bear Creek Ridge Grade School.They both have found a new phenomenal player.One is Shirley(Shazam)and the other is Aki Mikami.Shirley lost her father in the of Pearl Harbor and shows her hate for the Japanese.Aki had been sent to a camp where the Americans sent Japanese.They had both come back in time for the Bat 6(the softball game every sixth grade girl is looking forward to).Something really important happens in the game...but you have to read to find out.
3,Bat 6,Bat 6 is an intriguing novel. It is a book you want to cozy up with while Mrs. Wolff explains what it was like to be a girl right after World War Two. You will see how a soft ball game can unite or tear apart two towns. It also shows the cruelty to Japanese-Americans during and after the war. You can watch as a new girl's burning hatred for Japanese can cause her to lose control.
1,It could have been written better.,"Virginia Euwer wolff really had a lot going for her, but the way she wrote it and presented it really wasn't very good. She had such a great plot, and if only someone else had written it for her, and presented it in a fashionable style, there'd be a lot less bad comments for it, and a lot more people wanting to buy it. Overall, it was pretty crummy."
2,grip is peeling off handle on first use,Grip is peeling off handle on first use. After the first use of the body glove 75-foot 10 section ski rope the grip started peeling off the handle.
2,Handle seam seperates,"Rope started out good but after the first few times, the seam on the handle started to unravel. Poor design. Looking for a better one."
2,Liked it until it started to delaminate after 2 weeks,"2 weeks, liked it better than our other rope. Then the grip started to delaminate. Why on earth is the seam for the rope handle at the position of the handle that receives the most stress (boat side)? Even better, why does it have a seam in the first place? Poor handle design."
2,Not what I expected,"The cover is deceiving. It appears to be a DVD from his later years, but is actually from his early days. Plus the duets are nothing to be excited about."
4,Digital Divide and the Social Impact,"A serious study of the social impact of those who have access to new information and communication technologies and those who don't, have to consider this book to analyze the importance of the technology adoption in the economic and cultural develop of all countries. The book represents a force guide to anyone who studies the paper of the government to spread technology benefits to all and the social impact of this hard work."
5,Valuable For Beginners and Others,"I teach preaching to those who are beginning the process of entering ministry. I find that this book is extremely valuable for all who are wishing to learn the ""how to."" It also serves as a refresher for those who have been in the minsitry for many years."
3,Disappointing,"Only a fair treatment of the topic and liberal in it's orientation. A much better book is Elements of Preaching by Warren Wiersbe. It is excellent, to the point and a quick read."
3,replacement needle,Cannot find replacement needle for this phonograph help would greatly be appreciated.
3,A Little Let Down,"I am a big Andre Rieu fan and own many of his DVD's. This one, I felt, had much lighter weight music than he usually presents and not as professional guest musicians. I was disappointed."
4,Andre Rieu - Christmas Around the World,"Andre Rieu was suggested by a friend, we like himvery much but he is not one of our favorites. Wepersonally prefer piano music."
1,Andre Rieu - Christmas around the world,EVeryone should see at least one of his dvd's they are simple wonderful. I have bought 4 Andre's dvd's and enjoy each one of them. I am using some of them as gifts. They really are the enjoyable.
1,Dismatching Music & Characters,"I love Music of Andre. Christmas is the day for the born of Jesus. However, Andre never say about the born of the Jesus. Furthermore, he never celebrate the born of jesus. Maybe, he don't go to the church longtime. He also forget the spirt of chistmas. Everyone know that only 1% of japanese go the church. Most japanese go to the private shrine. Why did Andre enter the stage the japnese chidren? They don't understand the language(german & english), and also the christmas spirit. It was awkward."
4,Andre Rieu - Christmas Around the World,I love his music but was expecting something a bit better. His regular CDs are better quality. But I won't part with it.
4,"A great cd label maker, but hard to find media!","In defence of this product, I've used it to make various cd labels, and unlike the previous review, I had no problem what so ever with the printer. The 2 faults I do find with this product is that its not very durable,and it's hard to find the labels. I droped the applicator once and it broke, not bad enough to stop me from using it, but a more durable material would have been apreciated. Also, finding the labels is a pain. I had to order it mailorder from a company 10 states away from my state! All in all, as long as you don't drop it, this label maker is good"
1,Not very intuiative...,"This product is difficult to use. No tutorial is provide even though one is referenced in the user guide. The printer calibration did not seem to work. Items are very difficult to line up and fit into the templates. Over all, a real pain to get things to print right."
1,Not a good product,"I bought this product a week ago, and returned it today. Bad enough that the software was very difficult to figure out (and I have used Photoshop and others), but it just wouldn't print anything on my Epson printer. I thought I must be doing something wrong, but contacted Memorex: their answer was that they knew of the problem, had already talked to Epson, and suggested that I link to Epson UK and download a new printer driver! As if ! Solution: returned the kit and bought Fellowes Neato CD Labeller kit. It works!"
1,worthless waste of materials,"This thing is a piece of junk. Not only is the program a pain to use, but it is impossible to get the printer to line up with the templates. It didn't even print in the right shape. Calibrating the printer did nothing. I was fortunate to be able to return it to the store. From the looks of the packaging when I got it, I don't think I was the first to have returned it."
1,"Frame is poor, but merchant is mis-advertising it","The photo for this frame shows a double width center bar and sturdier legs than the actual bed frame shipped. For the bed frame I got, the wheels bent under the weight of the king bed. The advertisement makes this seem like a heavy duty frame, but it is not.I wonder whether the people that were happy were actually shipped the frame that is pictured. Don't buy this frame, especially not from this vendor."
1,Bad experience,"I ordered the item from target. It arrived within the week, missing two of the rollers. I immediately wrote to the help center about it. They said they would get back to me. One week later I again have to write and find out that they can't send the missing wheels I have to get a replacement, refund or use as is. Needless to say, I am returning it. How can you sell a product and not have replacement parts?"
1,"Cheap price, cheap construction","DO NOT BUY FOR A KING BED!!!! Center wheels bent in two days with our king bed. Frame came very quickly. Box was beat up, but all parts were there. All parts appeared new. No instructions, but not too difficult to assemble."
1,Poor,"Ordered this 2 days ago and received very quickly. Box beat up but all the part were there and the frames were not damaged. Needless to say I set it up and my box frames do not even fit on it. I oredered a California King and it is not a Cal King size! Very disappointed as it will be a hassle to box up and send back! I just want a refund. I have never had a problem ordering off Amazon but it only takes one time to turn me off. I will not order this type of thing online again, heading to the store once I get my refund."
2,Buy a more common brand,"I absolutely loved my TV when I first bought it. Excellent picture. It felt bigger than a 32"" because of the side speakers -- excellent sound. I was extremely happy and would have given it 5 stars. After about 6 months, the video started flickering. Within a few more weeks, the visual aspect of the TV stopped working at all. Because it is an uncommon brand, most TV repair places wouldn't take it. Shipping it in out of pocket would have been extremely expensive. I finally found a place that would take it and found out this TV is a lemon. The repair guy said many flat screens have overheating problems, which is what destroyed my video board. $350 to fix. Buy your TV in-store so you have somewhere that will take it back."
1,Stay Away from this Brand,"I would stay away from this brand. I purchased the 26 inch version of this TV, and after 3 weeks of use, this seemingly beautiful TV for the money stopped working. The TV is completely unusable....no screen, no reponse, nothing. Spend the extra money and buy a brand that will stand behind their product."
5,good guide,Good guide especially for those with limited microscope knowledge. Presented in an easy to understand format and is a good guide for my kids.
1,Beware: Does not fit the Mitsubishi F5MC1 transaxle,"Though Amazon's online catalog shows this backup light switch as applicable to the 1995-1999 Mitsubishi Eclipse with the 420A 2.0l DOHC engine and F5MC1 transaxle (built by New Venture Gear as the A578, and installed in Chrysler Neons beginning in 1994), this transaxle-mounted switch is actually for the turbo 2.0l engine, or the 2.4l SOHC engine.Update: Consider the Airtex 1S4941 for the F5MC1 transaxle. Also fits other NVG A578-equipped vehicles, like the Dodge Neon."
4,Liberace TV Bio-Pic,"This is the TV bio-pic produced in the late 80's starring Victor Garber and Maureen Stapleton. It has only previously been available on VHS in limited availability in some countries, this is its first appearance on DVD. As tv movies go it isn't too bad and the leading man gives a fairly good portrayal of Liberace. A fairly accurate bio-pic, I liked it a lot."
3,Too short for so long a life.,"The movie is way too short, and rather depressing. Liberace lived 67 years and had a full life. The movie does not capture Liberace's Magic of Believing. His magic on the stage was a performer which made you laugh and feel good, and this movie does not accomplish what so many loved about this man and his music."
1,NO WAY,"Movies that try to re-create an entertainer, comedian, or gifted artist -- all fall short.It is not possible to even come close to the memories I have of actually attending a Liberace show, a Red Skelton show, a Bob Hope show, because the real shows were so spontaneous.If you ever saw the real entertainer in a live show, skip the movie as you will ALWAYS be disappointed"
3,Polish Christmas,"This CD Is not as much fun as Sturr's Polka Christmas, but it was given to a Polish couple who enjoyed it very much."
3,Okay Christmas CD,"This is beautiful, but 4 of the songs are unfamiliar and are sung in a foreign language. If I had realized that, I wouldn't have purchased this CD."
3,Trust His Heart,"I absolutely love her song Trust His Heart, it has such deep meaning, but I was not impressed with the other songs on this CD. They didn't hold the same depth to them."
5,Not sure I will ever shoot without the Promax again!,"I received my Promax today. It it was packaged in a nice, sturdy box. I opened the package, installed the Promax on my flash and set out to test shoot. Was I supposed to read the directions? Oh well, the Promax is just that simple that you don't need to read the directions. Since I have a shoot tomorrow I needed to get familiar with the Promax as soon as possible.I LOVE it! I'm not sure I will ever shoot without it again. I don't do much shooting indoors but I wanted the flexibility from one product to bounce indoors and outdoors. The Promax is my answer!"
3,Usefull in rare situations,"I bought this diffuser for situations where the walls, I want to use to reflect the light off, are coloured or far a way. Although the area of reflection is not very large to produce the best soft light you can get from a portable diffuser, but it still delivers good results, at least better than using your flash without it. The Gold reflector accessory that comes with it works good too. The advantage of using the Promax against the likes of GaryFung dome is you direct the light towards your subject only and will not reflect the light from walls behind you with unwanted colour cast."
5,"Read this book, even if you're not into race car driving",Reading this book makes you realize how much auto racing is really allegory for life.
4,Needs to be combined with the others he's written,"There's a lot of good info in this book, lots of stuff to provoke thought, and it is presented in a very simple and easy to understand format that communicates the points well - like a military training manual (but with a little more humour)Unfortunately, it tends to rehash subjects discussed in Speed Secrets and Inner Speed Secrets, which means that the amount of new material (for owners of the other two) is roughly half of what is already a pretty thin book.Between the three books, there is one outstanding book in there. If Mr Bentley writes another installment (as he threatens to do in this book) I hope he compliles all his books into one big one, adds a couple of new chapters to cover whatever new material he wants to add, and then edits it into a coherent whole."
4,Great informaton for a beginner,"I purchased this book for my son-in-law, as he is in his first year of SCCA road racing. When I first gave him the book, he read it from cover to cover, then read it from cover and to cover, and refers to the book when we talk about racing. In my day, I raced Corvette's in SCCA for 15 years. The only reason I gave this book 4 stars, is because I didn't read it. Although, when I researched for books for my son-in-law, I was very impressed with the contents of this book."
4,Offbeat Race Advice,"Covers topics most race driving instruction books do not, including specific advice about mental attitudes. Good companion to other books which are more focused in specific driving techniques."
3,"It works. Its loud. Its small. Not ""high RPM"".","I was looking forward to it after reading the reviews here. From one it even seemed that you have the option of useing batteries.I was surprised at how small and delicate it is. I should have realized the scale by the size of the grains in the picture, but still.It grinds pretty slowly. Its takes about 30-40 secs to grind a full tablespoon onto my cereal. (I am not even sure at what fineness, as I am unable to move the ring that chooses it. I dont want to use to use too much force out of fear of cracking the plastic.)This might be the norm and no machine does it faster, but in the morning rush, I thought it would work far faster."
5,Great for adults,"I love the way it smells, and the way my skin feels and my hair feels and looks after using it. (I have thick yet very fine hair, and this stuff really perks it up.)It's not as expensive to use as you might think - it's quite thick and a little goes a long way."
3,wrong item sent,"Ordered a smoke windshield and rec""d a clear. Assy requires (7) 3/4 inch bolts for hardware rec'd 5 and 2 xtra 1/2 inch. I'll live with it."
2,Extremely Late,I ordered the book on Jan 5th for school but did not receive it until Feb 1st. I'm not sure what happened but the sellers were very kind and responsible about it. The book was also in very good condition.
2,Buying this item is like buying a puzzle,"The ""user manual"" shipped with the parts is not specific for this model. The wiring diagram is for module that does not look like the one I received. Requests for help from Pyleaudio were ignored. There was absolute no operations instructions. If you need instruction to install this item, don't buy it. Diagram showed the sensors should be installed with arrow pointing up. If you do that, you will get an alarm despite nothing is in the way. Install the sensor with the arrow down (opposite to the manual instruction), they work fine. There is no adjustment to the volume of the warning, only on or off. It is very loud."
1,DEFECTIVE ITEM THAT THEY SEND ME,"This day open & installed the reverse sensor, but I was have surprise!!! The display is on in reverse but no function with objects!!!Only give me the temperature... I dissapointed with this item.... I not recommended this..."
1,"very low quality, not very precise, low sound... NOT RECOMMENDED","This has a very low quality, I had to buy one new sensor because one them was defective, it doesnt come with clear instructions, you dont even know where to put all those cables, It is not very precise is very variable... you can see 0,8 then 0,3 and then 0,7 just going back, also the advising sound is very low you have to slow down to 0 volume other wise its very very hard to listen and even in 0, you have to make an effort to listen...NOT RECOMMENDED..."
3,Basic Temporary Watch,I bought this watch for $6 as a temporary watch while my usual watch was repaired. I found that the band felt very stiff on my arm verging on uncomfortable. I found it more than usually difficult to set the time and alarm. I would recommend this watch as a temporary watch or a backup.
5,a great joy,"Gringos was the first Portis novel I read; though nowhere does it approach, say, the perfection of the first few pages of Norwood, it remains, in some ways, my favorite of Portis's five novels. In Gringos, as in all his novels, Portis communicates to us the narrator's extraodinary compassion for a cast of misfits and losers. In the end, then, Gringos doesn't show showcase its author's justly-praised comedic gifts. It's also deeply moving."
4,Beatniks do Mexico,"Charming the whimsical story-telling, adventurous, travelling narrative way of somebody like Kerouac telling of cross-continental escapades, Portis weaves an intriguing plot of sporadic Yankees defiling and deflowering the ancient Mayan ruins of Mexico. Although his catalogue of names sometimes overwhelms and confuses, the tale engages the reader and amuses. The characters mostly bear about this anti-hero personality--each and every one of them including the narrator. And their characterizations certainly warrant the derisive nickname indicated by the title of the book. Eventually we'll see it listed as a top book to inspire traveling to Central America."
1,a bad choice,"I bought this cd playerlast December and it's already broken.It broke in June. It's not somthing that I did to it, The main gear inside it just got stripped. I love Aiwa products but this didn't even last for over a half a year!"
1,defective,"arrived defective, would only work with jack inserted halfway. pretty useless in this condition."
2,OK but not built to last,Works fine for price but you get what you pay for. Tape adaptor broke after 2 months. Sound quality is average. Often when it skips it shuts off. No backlit display.
5,the best player ive seen(or heard?),"it's a great little player ive had mine sense 1998 and it's been working great ever sense, it just died today on me though. but it's ok. i decided to buy another one just because i know i'll get my money's worth. i've to dropped mine.slammed it. kicked it.. and just beat it. but it's a great product and a good buy.."
2,"Good sound, when it plays","Bought this to play in car and for trips. Didn't skip, but would stop playing the current song for no apparent reason. I would have to skip to next song to get it to play. After a while it's a nuisance. I then bought the newest Sony that has all the same features (ems, car ready, bass, etc.) and threw the Aiwa in the trash."
3,Average player at an average price,"Like the summary says, average all the way around. But the price would lead you to believe that."
5,Perfect for Angel LCD,Fit perfect to replace my old feed neck. Low profile to reduce hopper height. Great price too ! Don't hesitate to buy if u still have this marker.
5,Delightful and uplifting,"I really liked this book. It's a quick, very enjoyable read, with very positive imagery.Uplifting, inspiring and thought provoking. The author encourages the reader to follow their passions, ""their sparkles"", and reminds us through refreshingly creative writing we are all interconnected in our lives although traveling different paths.In addition, it is beautifully presented. After I read it, I got some copies as gifts for friends and family I know will appreciate it.The style of this author's writing is wonderful and the artwork further complements to make this book a timeless gem which can be read and re-read by readers of all ages."
2,"""Detective"" an unbelievable and uneven read","This is the only Arthur Hailey novel I've read and it didn't live up to his reputation as a great novelist. Initially I was intrigued by the theme of the novel, however, as I read the book two things put me off. First, the characters are just not believable, and second, he kept going back and forth in time as he told the story. I found the latter especially annoying as I tryed to understand why he chose this approach to write this book. I did finish the book, but I've read better."
3,A View from India,"I have been a Arthur Hailey fan for the last 4 years. While I have immensely enjoyed most of his works, Detective was not a particularly satisfying book. And yet there are parts that are definitely thought provoking. In India, death sentences are simply carried out by hanging the convicted and the system does not allow for a witness group. So in most cases the final emotions of a prisoner remain unrecorded. Hailey successfully manages to capture the horror of a execution and its impact on people.What could have been avoided are the lurid details of Ainslie's love life with the Mayor's daughter. And yet the effect of a woman's scorn on a man's life are a clear warning to adventurous souls.In all, not a book to write home about, but one that can be company on a long journey."
4,Go Inside a Homicide Department,"One thing you can be sure of in Arthur Hailey books is excellent and detailed research.This one takes you inside the Homicide department of Miami PD and it is an excellent read. It's an effectively twisty thriller with a satisfying and logical conclusion.Serial Killer Elroy ""Animal"" Doil is hours aways from execution in the electric chair. He wants to make a final confession to Detective Malcolm Ainslie. While guilty of some gruesome murders, he denies one double killing attributed to him that sets Ainslie off in an investigation which disrupts the highest levels of the Miami PD.Arthur Hailey is a tremendous storyteller and entertains the reader. This one does not disappoint."
5,Not an attack on religion,"I did not view this book as an attack on christianity or catholicism. I thought this was a good book about a man who lost his faith. It happens to some of us sometimes, because we are not perfect. The thing I found most compelling, that he was able to admit his imperfection. I found this book to be a compelling story about the paths in life that we must take to get to certain point in our lives."
4,Its a classic thriller i have never read before,The Novel is really classy and has covered entire picture about the Miami police. More important is it represents about the ethics of bible. The suspense is really breathtaking and interests any newcomers to thrillers.
2,3 or 4 short stories in one book.,"Having read Hailey's work many years ago (Airport, Hotel) I was dissapointed by how poorly this book flowed together. It appears Hailey tried to take many short storys, tie them together, and assemble it into a quality narrative. Though the concept of the book was a good one I would have enjoyed it better if I would have had more sense as to where the story was going. The pieces just didn't fit well together."
2,First time and last time....,....I read an Arthur Hailey book. This book was boring. It was totally predictable and shallow with far too many unimportant details. This guy should write history books instead of novels. The only reason he gets the second star is because I finished the book.
2,Extremely Dull and boring,"This is my first Arthur Hailey book and I doubt that I'll be reading any more if this is representive of his body of work. I gave it 2 stars only because of the police procedural research. To read good detective fiction turn to Lawrence Block, Dennis Lehane, Raymond Chandler etc."
2,Disappointing,"I expected alot better from Arthur Hailey. He clearly has never been in police work and did little research with those who are. I literally put the book down at times because I was laughing so hard at the ""police procedures"" and supposed radio dispatches and 911 calls. I am a police dispatcher and have read many books that are fictional but were very real and true to form about the law enforcement world. This was a comdey, not a mystery. I think the overall concept of the book (story line) was good, but the author should have done a lot more research and spent some time with real homicide detectives."
2,Not up to the mark.,The book tried to give a lot of information on the working of the Detective Dept which is mostly well known. The story was carrying on well till the author deviated to other sub-plots. The characters of the story are not impressive. The details on the movements and the methodology of the Detective Dept. is boring. To a reader who is a fan of the author this will be disappointing.
2,"I never guessed the killer in a mystery, until now!","The set up of a death row inmate (serial killer) claiming innocence of one particular crime is not new. Mary Willis Walker handled this sort of plot superbly in ""Red Scream."" Arthur Hailey fumbles his chance. The characters are flat. A homicide detective who is an ex-priest would seem to be intrinsically fascinating. This hero is boring. His motivations for both entering and leaving the priesthood are shallow and unconvincing. The supporting police officers are so poorly drawn that they are nearly indistinguishable. The flashbacks are obtrusive and unilluminating. And I spotted the supplemental killer long before the hero did.With George, Lehane, Parker, Kellerman, Burke, and others turning out excellent new mysteries, pass this one by."
2,Disappointing,"Mr.Hailey uses this novel to express every left of center shibboleth to the detriment of the story,which is average. The ""suprises"" are telegraphed well in advance, the ""hero's"" lack of morals detracts from the yarn. To a reader that has read the author for twenty years this was a disappointment."
1,Predictable with an unworthy hero.,I had a difficult time with the primary character of this book. I did not like him. In a single paragraph he discusses his disdain of unethical investigative methods used by some police officers and his adulterous affair with one of his subordinates of which he is without remorse. I finished this book anyway and even though the plot had several twists it seemed that there were many warnings before each turn. There were no surprises. I do not recommend this book
4,heroic legend of arislan parts 3 and 4,"In the 3rd and 4th part of the Arislan videos the action really starts to heat up. Arislan feels guilt over inocents that kill themselfs because their kingdom was captured by Prince Arislans forces. This video gets indepth with Arislan and how he feels about war. He also finds out about how his father had cheated his way to become the king of Palsia. Also ""the man in the mask"" learns of a way to defeat Arislan with a magical sword."
1,How could this be the end!?!?!?,"To start of , this is a average show the characters are ok I really started 2 like this show because it was just starting 2 get good and then it ends abruptly with literally all plot lines unresolved, like they just got tired of making the show .Get record of lodoss war instead"
2,Will do...,"I have used these labels for a long time, mostly because they seem to be the only ones out there. The paperstock is good, but if you have a good printer the paper won't do it justice. The labels always end up looking kinda cheap. I would love to see Memorex make a package with glossy paper/high end paper. Maybe Epson will beat them to it."
4,"Great, but takes patience to learn","I love the software and the finished product looks great. I rated it down for user-friendliness. Memorex has the greatest helpline, though, if you get stuck. After talking to 4 people over 3 days, I finally got it right. The arrow for the feed into the printer is upside down (at least that's the way it is for my printer). I thought the jewel case backs lacked perforation and didn't understand why I'd need to use a paper cutter; but as it turned out, it was perfect when I turned the page around. The helpline folks helped me calibrate my printer. My design was off just a little--I needed to move it a few millimeters to the left and down. I recommend telephoning for help if you can't figure something out. They are very patient and very versed in the software. There is an extensive help menu, but I found that confusing."
1,Poor Quality,I Found that these CD-case label-insert blanks are of very poor quality paper and are quite thin and flimsy. Also very prone to ink bleeding. I suggest you print out your inserts on some good photo paper and use a good paper cutter to create your own. That's what I ended up doing and got superior results!
1,Worthless,These inserts don't have any place to write the names of the tunes . All they are is a blank piece of paper that serves no function. They are worthless.
3,So so,"These days, people seem to have forgotten what jewel cases are, but these inserts are a definite step up from the scissors and printer paper method. They don't look especially good or fit better than adequately, but they are better than....see above."
4,Jewel case inserts,"The inserts work great with my CD packaging program. The SureThing inserts are higher quality paper which prints much brighter, but priced 40% higher. These memorex inserts are adequate."
3,Poor software,"The Memorex inserts are great. The label making software on the other hand sucks. I've spent a few hours trying to get the text to line up with the paper without success. Perhaps it's my printer, HP C4280, but considering the other reviews, I think not. Do not buy this for the insert labeling software. The inserts themselves are great, if you don't mind filling them in by hand."
2,Shun the shun electric knife sharpener,"I'm a Shun fan. Love their knives, but their knife sharpener isn't up to this company's usual quality standards. It's useless on short blades like the paring knife and can easily put nicks in the blade -- regardless of length. Not what you want for these instruments. And if you're expecting ""factory sharp"", forget it."
1,Shun Electric Sharpener,"Considering the quality and price for their knives I expected the same for the sharpener. I was extremely disappointed with this machine. After trying it out on some of my other kitchen knives, I would NEVER let my Shun knives get anywhere near it as it would destroy the edge they so carefully put on their knives. Better to use that $10 sharpener that you drag across the blade than this machine. Under-powered and puts more of a chisel edge than a nice long bevel. I will be returning mine."
5,A SERIOUS trekker's guide,"Solid information for the serious trekker/climber, Jordans' `BHUTAN: A Trekker's Guide' is also a delightful read with good photos for the armchair traveler (2nd edition 2008 January). There's a saying among the Bhutanese `A crow is not a bird/ A bush is not a tree/ And Thimphu is not Bhutan.' This is the real Bhutan. There are several Bhutan guidebooks but none like Mr. Jordans. This is a guide through rural Bhutan by a professional with intimate knowledge of the country's cultural heartland, starting with a wealth of in depth information from the point where you leave motorized transport behind."
4,Trekkers Guide Review,"This is an excellent guide to trekking routes in Bhutan. It does not provide all the general background information found in other guidebooks, but is stongly focussed on a good range of trekking routes. I have found it very useful in planning my next trek, as it includes a wider range of treks than can be found in other books and websites. The trek descriptions and sketch maps are quite detailed and informative."
1,Lots of Problems,"I bought this player about a year ago. I have always respected the JVC name. Not any more! I too have experienced the same ""lock-up"" problems.... ""Arlington Road"" messed up my player so bad that I had to call JVC for advice. They gave me a reset procedure that worked, but only temporarily. My player continued to have this same problem on other disks as well. I also encountered some MAJOR audio and video distortion while watching ""Notting Hill"". I took that disk to a friends house and it played perfectly with no prblems whatsoever on his RCA player. I have also had problems with accessing certain special features (cast biographies, trailers, etc...) on some disks. Once again, these DVDs played fine on other players.The features on this player are very nice, but they don't do any good when the player won't play DVDs...."
3,Picky but useable,I like this dvd player except it is extremely picky playing dual layer dvd's. This unit will play cd-rw's but not CD-R's
2,It breaks soon after....,"I had been given this machine in a sealed box brand new. After less than two weeks of use I began to have the same problems the previous reviewer has reported. It began to skip portions, got stuck and froze - then finally refuses to read any disc inserted into the machine. I am curious if the unit has major malfunction problems and just how many other people are having the same problems? Do not buy this machine. JVC refuses to stand behind the warranty and is giving some excuse about the manufacturers date being the date their warranty starts. This is one to keep clear of. After the warranty issue with JVC I have now changed my mind on any further JVC purchases. From now on I stick with Sony. They stand behind their products and assist their customers."
5,Great product and a great value,"This was the first piece of equipment I bought when I started building my surround sound home theatre system and I have been very pleased. I did a significant amount of research and believe this is one of the best DVD players on the market. It is definitely a ""Must Have""!"
4,Cruel Intentions,I bought this player a couple of months ago. It suddenly stopped working after trying to play Cruel Intentions. I was happy with they player up until this point.I just brought it in for servicing. Thanks for the info!
5,It works- why pay more?,"It works, it perfect. Why pay for for Monster cables (I've some, couldn't tell the different)."
1,where is it?,i can't really review this item because i never recived it woulda been nice tho only gave it one star because its required that you put at least one in the rating heh
2,DVI to HDMI Cable 6ft Male-Male,worked about a week and stoped working cable was tight but picture was always going out even after moving it around alittle 2 get the picture backso i just purchased a DVI-D to HDMIu better off buying this dvi-d to HTMI Connector instead and just use your HTMI CABLE WITH THIS ADAPTERplug in one in of your HTMI cable into the Adapter and the other in into the HTMI Portnote: if u using this on a HDTV Like i did make sure u have the audio and video cable pluged in in the back of your tv audio/video portd (red and white)
1,sucks!,no no no no no no no no it didnt fit!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! it made me so mad i should of bought the webcam first!
2,Did not work with my router,"I tried using this item to allow my PC, which has only USB inputs, to connect to my Cisco router's serial port. I could get connected, but the converter failed to pass any commands to the router. After buying a Belkin USB to Serial Converter from Staples I was able to configure my router with no problems. Product may work fine with other serial devices but it was worthless for my needs. People looking for an adapter for their routers should look elsewhere."
1,Cable causes video to flicker,"After about a week, this cable started causing my video to flicker. Even the slightest bump or movement will cause the video to cut out for 2-3 seconds."
1,"Defective cable, could not display a complete signal on monitor from laptop","Plugged in the cable, multiple dead pixles displayed on monitor connected to laptop. Tested Monitor with other cable works fine. When sending video accelerated content cable was unable to display a signal at all, monitor would continually flicker. Cable is defective, quite dissapointing after waiting two weeks."
3,Received Wrong Item,"The product bag I received contained a standard HDMI 6' cable. The bag was originally labeled as a standard HDMI cable, but was re-labeled as a ""DVI to HDMI Cable"", which was obviously wrong. I chose to return this item and then ordered another brand's cable to guarantee I wouldn't receive another mismatched cable. On the item I returned, I made it clear on the bag that it was not what it was barcoded as, so hopefully nobody else will receive the returned item again by mistake."
5,works great,"works just as described!! good picture, goes great with new 46 inch tv and id suggest it to a friend"
1,Use Less item....not working properly,"I bought this cable last week, when i connected the cable it worked but after few minute the screen goes off every time, so i need to connect it again and again during a single game play.i don't like this product not good for gaming ."
2,Not as good as my VGA connection,I used this to connect a Mac Mini to my HDTV. The picture was worse than my DVI to VGA connection.
4,As advertised.,"Used to connect an xbox 360 to a DVI pc monitor. Works perfectly. This cable only transmits video,no audio. Its not able to. HDMI cables can transmit both audio/video.If you need to connect your xbox to a pc monitor this is the way to go."
5,Great Product,18 Months ago I purchased an inexpensive 23 inch HDMI monitor that did not come with an HDMI to DVI cable. After checking with Best Buy and other local stores I decided not to purchase the cable due to it's expense and connected the monitor using the VGA connection.When I saw this item on AMAZON I was skeptical of the quality of a cable that cost me more for shipping than it did to purchase. I was pleasantly suprised. It is a high quality product that works great. Now my monitor can display true 1080 Hi Def and my movies and games look great. I'll be purchasing other items from this vendor.
4,Better than I Realized,"Upon receiving this cable, I was a bit surprised at it's diameter: a little thinner than I expected. And on first try, my HDTV was unable to ""see"" the computer, leading me to believe that ""you get what you pay for"" (57 cents + shipping). Well, I'm writing this review to eat some crow. Problems between monitor and PC were due to video resolution and everything is great. I could not be happier. Great price and seller delivered as promised."
4,No Better Value,"For only a couple dollars you simply cannot beat this price. I've been using the cable now for maybe 1-2 months with no problems from my DVD player to my HP 2009m monitor, which only has a DVI and VGA connection. Don't let stores rip you off, buy the cable. Nothing about the cable suggests inferior construction."
1,Does not support monitor stand-by.,I bought this cable to use with a new computer with HDMI output to connect to my Dell monitor with DVI input. When the computer is on the product works great. When the computer is off or sleeping the monitor thinks the computer is unplugged and not just off/sleeping.The cable does not properly support monitor standby.
4,Product worked great,"The product worked great, but it seemed to take a long time to get it - at least 4 weeks."
5,nice cable,the cable works nothing special about it. I can connect my laptop to my HDTV so it works! the signal is clear.
4,good and cheap,"i have the cable for almost 12 months and still is working, i connected the time warner cable box with the lcd tv and the quality screen is good, i recomend it."
5,Works great,"Purchased this for my brother, who wanted to hook a second monitor to his new Dell PC. The product arrived in a timely fashion, in great condition, was easy to hook up and works as expected,Highly recommended!!!"
4,Worked for Raspberry Pi video output to DVI monitor,Worked just fine for video output from my Raspberry Pi to my DVI monitor. I was afraid I was going to have to get an adaptor or expensive monitor.
5,Can't beat it for the price,"Can't say anything bad about this cable. I was able to fit two (DVI side) cables side by side on my video card, which had been a problem in the past. Length is great for reaching to the monitors, and of course, the resolution is great!"
5,Great Cable,Fast shipping and a great price for a great product. Why pay more when the highest quality is right here? I use this cable to connect my computer's graphics card to my T.V. and it looks amazing.
5,$40 Cable for $3,Go to any BestBuy in your area and I'm sure you'll find there dynex cable which does the same exact thing as this for $40. I have been using this one now for a couple days and works just like the one from best buy. Not to mention this cable is $37 dollars cheaper.
1,Defective DVI connector.,"Only good thing I can say is thank goodness for Amazon's return policy and service.First of all, the cable wasn't as the pictures show. It was a 10' (as opposed to a 6') with a thick blue colored braid with white stripes. Although I didn't want the extra length, that wasn't my problem with it. The DVI connector was defective to the point that it wouldn't slide all the way in. It was so far out that the screws couldn't even reach the mating connector threads. Upon visual inspection right next to another DVI cable, you could see that the pins were not properly centered. What kind of QC is that? Did they even try to mate it?"
5,Perfect,Worked like a charm.Used this cable to adapt an apple tv's HDMI output to DVI for a front projection system.
1,Poor service,"Ordered this on 12/26 and item didn't ship until 1/16. After almost one month, the cable is still not here. Bad Service and no offer to fix problem I am being told to wait and be patient. Do not buy until you have at least two months to spare before you need this cable."
1,Poor Performance,Cable is functional but is not capable of delivering 1080p (1920x1080) output ... Since my monitor is 1080p the cable miserably failed ... I will call it too cheap to be good
1,trash,"This cable does not work. It conveys a gray screen of static and only make a slight connection when the plug is just barely touching the connection, but not when it's plugged in the whole way. i guess you get what you pay for."
1,You get what you pay for - junk should be cheap!,"Connected my GeForce GTS 250 to my pair of HP w2408h monitors and the picture was awful! Bought a 'real' set of cables and amazingly enough, my video became crystal clear. Beware of cheap!!! The quality of both audio and video output are limited by the 'weakest link' - in this case, it was the cables! Don't waste your time!"
2,Wrong cable,The cable looks really nice. Too bad they sent me the wrong one! I ordered this DVI to HDMI cable and got one that has HDMI hookups on both sides. Great job guys. It would make me nervous to order from a company that can't even sent the right product.
4,It is what it is: a decent DVI to HDMI cable for the money,You need a cable to run from your computer to your LCD/LED computer monitor? Here it is.This one is fairly well made. It works. It's less expensive than most.Not much more to say. Just get it!
1,It's a waste of money (and time).,"I read postive reviews here and ordered this cable from SF Planet via Amazon. I wouldn't believe how one can make this cable so cheap, and cheap it is. It doesn't work!! Not only for the money I paid for it but also for the time I spent to debug my connection to convince myself that it's not my monitor or my video card. I ended up ordered the Amazon branded cable which costs more but it works on the first try. I'm now connected and running.Using the seller's web site to request RMA is also fruitless. I could submit my request alright but there is no response. Even after I told them I'll give them another chance to response before I give them negative review. Silent, na da. So the bottom line, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
1,"Actually 18+1 pin, not the 24+1 pin cable pictured. May be an issue for some devices","I bought the cable to connect my PS3 to my TV. It was actually an 18+1 pin cable, not the 24+1 pin cable pictured on the page. The price for the cable is very inexpensive, but be aware that you may have some issues depending on your device. In my case, my TV was having issues with it and I was getting green snow when I played. I bought an Amazon 24+1 instead and didn't have any problems."
5,work as described,"this cable is solid. works as described, good for computers that has no hdmi interface but the displays have hdmi interface."
5,Great service,I bought this dvi to hdmi cable for an old plasma that was given to me by a relative. The shipping was fast and it worked like it was suppose to.
1,WRONG ITEM SHIPPED,It looks like that in the picture but it is a hdmi end to end no DVI at all on either end so this is a load of bull.
1,Disappointing,"I received the cable after a 3+ week wait. When it arrived, it was loose in a plastic sealed bag with no padding. It was unusable due to the fact that the metal outer collar was bent inward."
2,The product didn't match the picture,I thought I ordered the dvi-d 24+1 pin to Hdmi according to the picture. Instead I got the 18+1 pin to Hdmi.
5,Perfect.,"I looked for a DVI to HDMI Cable.I find one on Amazon. I buyI wait. I wait. Man, what is this Pony Express?It arrives and I jump with joy. Not really. I can't because I have both amputated legs.I plug it in. It works fine. No problems.Who am I that DVI to HDMI Cable works for me.Who am I that DVI to HDMI Cable would send his son to Earth to die for my sins.Who else but DVI to HDMI Cable would combat the evil of going to another a room to play my PS3.I trust in DVI to HDMI Cable to save the world from sin and aberration.If you think having no legs is a problem, try not having DVI to HDMI Cable.Thank you DVI to HDMI Cable. For everything.lifewithoutlimbs.com"
1,Doesn't EVEN handel 1080P,THIS CABLE sucks spend a few more dollars. It can't handle 1080p across it. I opened it up and plugged it in and it doesn't work until I place the resolution down to 720P. Well it works at 1080i but the screen flickers... All in all spend a little bit more money and get something that works. I feel dumb for buying such a cheap cable and expecting it to work.
3,It works,"Not sure what else to say then it works in connecting a laptop to a TV. Overall, decent, reliable purchase."
3,Worked,"When I first plugged it in it worked great, but then the picture went away. I was going to return it but a 2 year old has taken it and I haven't seen it since."
2,Worked well till it broke,the cord worked for like 3 months before it stopped giving me clear picture from my laptop. The quality was good while it worked.
4,Works as expected,This product is working well to connect my SFF PC to my 47 in lcd. To order was easy and received item in a timely manner.
1,"Bad, Stopped working a month after warrenty expired","A month after the warranty expired the cable became defective. The tv wouldn't even recognize that it was connected to the computer anymore. I even tried changing inputs and devices, so it was definitely a bad cable. I would spend a couple extra bucks and get a cable that would last a little longer then 3 months."
3,Tedious and basic,"I'm a university student who purchased this book to get a little more insight into how software works / is designed / is integrated into IT. Based on other reviews, I felt this book would do the trick, and would be engaging.However... this book only describes software in the most rudimentary way. It is essentially a big glossary of basic terms and principles and never probes the dynamics of the relationship between software and the designer, and software and the user.Furthermore, it is a tedious read. It discusses software with the monotony of my most hated accounting texts.Bottom-line, if you want the facts and just the facts, buy this book. If you truly want to understand how software is created, the role it plays in our lives, and its potential, keep looking."
4,"Nice Bike, Very Light Weight","We just bought this bike in a store, fully assembled, and about 10 dollars more than the Amazon listed price. It is extremely light weight which is nice as my mom and I will both be using it, and it will be parked in the back of our garage. It is very easy to maneuver out of the garage, even with the car inside due to its lightness. I rode a much heavier bike before, so this almost felt too light.The construction seems sound and the seat is quite comfortable. Our only complaint is that there is an unusual clicking sound while pedaling. We think we know what is causing it, but it may take a while to locate the area that needs adjusting.I give a 4/5 as I have not fully tested its performance and am not happy with the clicking, however, if assembled yourself, it should be fine.One last note, the quick release for the seat and front wheel is very handy."
4,I Believe She Lives,"I believe that the young Anastasia escaped at the time of the assasination of her father, mother, and her older siblings. After watching the specials on her, I feel confident that she did survive the overthrow. I also believe that if she hasn't already died she is still out there. And it would be a huge miracle for her to come out. She may be able to take the throne foe her father because I believe that is what he would of wanted her to do."
3,Ehhh.,"Interesting, but nothing I haven't seen before. People (which I think mostly are ...) who believe in the story of Anna Anderson being the Grand Duchess wouldn't like this book. I'm quite sure about these DNA tests, but then again, one would be better off buying The Final Chapter by Massie which explains everything and I mean everything (except for a few things scientists forgot, like Tatiana being the missing daughter). As for knowing of the visit in 1916? Letters to his wife and from are all about being at the front. Ernst was not in Russia, although it is common knowledge Nicholas wanted to settle the war at the Hague."
4,Quest for anastasia,Good book very interesting. Would recommend if your a romanov fan. The book puts very good details on who anna anderson really was. The one person she was not was grand duchess anastasia. Anastasia died with the rest of her family on that cellar in ekaterinburg.
2,Nothing above & beyond here!,This is indeed a good book on different techniques to catch fish but the problem is that this book does not offer anything beyond what so many other books do. If this is one of your first complete books on fly fishing then I think you will find great value within the pages but if you already have comprehensive books on technique then you might just as well re-read your others.
2,"Very pricey, not as big of a capacity as the Jaz/other disks","This is OK, but personally, out of experience, I would recommend either the Jaz or the other great/cheap drives out there today. Be sure to buy these in bulk if you have a Zip drive, because if they don't come individually, and if you buy them in small packs (3 or 7), you'll end up paying a hefty price for them."
3,Great product!,"I have used the Iomega zip drive for over 1 1/2 years, and it is great. If you ever need to back something up, or if you need a drive to download to from the internet, the 100 Meg / 250 Meg zip is the way to go."
5,rough start but ended very well,"After almost 2 weeks I decided to call Amazon to find out where my package was. Well turns out, silly me, I typed in the wrong address by one number. They changed it and shipped out my shoes to me AGAIN with no problems. I was throughly pleased with my experience."

5,A Staple for Every Kitchen,"I cook many times a week, sometimes everyday. Whenever I need a solid, tested and correct recipe, I definitely turn to this cookbook. I am also a collector of cookbooks and believe me this is one you need on your shelf. I have tried basic and complicated items and all have been wonderful. If you need pictures this is not the cookbook for you."
1,A cookbook I never use,"""Recipies for everyday"" is a very misleading title. At least I don't make caviar on toast for 100 people every day.The only recipie I have actually made from the book was chocolate chip cookies. A pound of butter later, I had the worst cookies I have ever made.I wanted to make flatbread the other day and couldn't find a recipie anywhere. Finally I looked in the index of this book. There was a flatbread with some kind of relish recipie... the first ingredient was 1 flatbread. Great, thanks Martha."
2,Who lives like this???,"I was expecting more practical suggestions, but, really, who lives like Martha Stewart? It is in my bookcase, I've only looked at it twice. Just not for me."
2,Martha v. Paula Deen,"Lots of butter, cream, creme fraiche, sour cream, lard, and shortening in this book.. and did I mention butter?I understand it isn't advertised as a healthy version, but all moderation seems thrown out the window with this book. One recipe called for sour cream, cream, and butter! Dang! I have Martha's Cooking School book which I love, but this one just doesn't do it for me. I will use it as a reference as there are some interesting pairings of flavor in this book (2 stars), but as far as a recipe book, my arteries quiver when I look at it.Also, for those who like pictures.. no pics in this book. I knew that buying it from the bookstore, but onliners aren't aware."
1,The Marthat Stewart Cookbook Collected Recipes for Everyday,"I was VERY disappointed when this ""like new"" copy arrived. The dust jacket was not only dirty, but torn and the top of the book was soiled as well. If this is considered a ""like new"" copy, I'd hate to see what a used one looked like."
2,An inspirational read but recipe results frustrating...,"Even experienced cooks don't get good results with this cookbook. Recipes are inspiring to read but must be tinkered with to succeed. Usually cooking time and temperature are the culprits but occasionally even ingredient quantities are off. But this has been our experience with most Martha Stewart recipes (they don't seem carefully tested before publication). Try all recipes before planning your dinner party and take notes. Analyze what happens and note how to fix method for next attempt. You will learn from this process but will probably throw your first results down the disposal. Poll your cooking friends, mine all report the same experiences with Martha Stewart recipes."
2,Her Stuff Never Works Out...,"I have tried Martha's receipes time and time again. I can probably count on ONE hand, the amount of times a receipe has worked. I don't know what the problem is. Maybe she leaves something out, or the time/temp. is off. I'm not sure. But, anyhow, they just don't work.However, there is a bright side to her books (hence, the extra star) they are very entertaining to read. You can certainly gain some inspiration and creativity from her books, but just look for a receipe elsewhere.Her books are NOT for the everyday cook."
4,Inspiring but impractical for everyday use,"I really enjoy browsing through this cookbook, however, I've found it impractical for everyday use. Many of the recipes call for unusual and hard to find (translation-expensive) items. For example, about 85-90% of the hors d'ouvre recipes call for caviar, at least as a garnish. My warning to you is expect to spend extra money on groceries to make most of these recipes. Also, as many of the gourmet recipes take many steps to prepare, expect to spend awhile in the kitchen."
5,Highly Recommend,"This is a beautiful and important book that I highly recommend. It is beautiful because it details the complex relationships of Jocelyn and Aaron, their four sons, Jocelyn's brother Joseph and his wife Elena, a spy. It is a love story and a story of betrayal. The author deals lovingly with his characters and beautifully describes the strength of women in all their roles and diverse situations.It is important because it takes place against the background of World War II. While the family is fictitious the events from the war are accurate and taken from the author's personal memento's and experience. There are also many incidents which parallel the war turmoil of today. For anyone old enough to remember the Second World War, reading this book will be an emotional experience."
1,Saved by a Review!,"Whew! I was thisclose to spending a gift card on this book that is outrageoulsy expensive, even by Amazon's measures. I read the One Star review and was so glad I did! I love reading AUTObiographies for that very reason...they are words from the person themselves, not someone who is getting their facts 3rd hand and beyond or worse, making it all up for a good read. These blessed men are long gone now and we still enjoy their great comic acts. I would be sick to read lies about them and assume they were true. I'll pass on this and just continue watching them in reruns. RIP Stooges. We love ya! I'll only purchase AUTObiographies, thank you."
4,OK lens for the money.,"Given to wife as a gift, as she is the picture-taker in the family. Nice lens, good feel, not extremely heavy. She needed an ultra-wide to complete all her lenses, and this one gives her that wide-angle camera shot she never had before."
5,Great for vitamins,I take vitamins with and without meals thru the day. This box has 6 compartments and holds at least 6 pills per compartment. It stays closed and is easy to carry around in a purse or pocket. Great pill box.
5,A STRONG BODY OF WORK,"I bought this on a whim over a year ago and finally got around to reading it. I must say I was impressed. Blanchard uses words as a painter uses colors and the result is often a strikingly vivid portrait, be it the overview of the environment we are entering or a wafer-thin slice of life. I found most of her characters to be refreshingly brash, usually fighting for their independence yet always under-equipped (whether they realize it or not). This is an excellent collection of short stories, right up there with Raymond Carver. Actually, her writing reminds me more of Thom Jones and Susan Minot. But Blanchard certainly has her own distinct voice, which I hope to be hearing more of."
1,Mabis Wrist Blood Pressure Monitor,"Not a reliable blood pressure monitor. Reading have great variances, even if taken back to back."
3,Uneven collection,"A collection of short stories and novellas. The first half of the book is very good, and I enjoyed the writing and emotions of the stories. The last two stories are just odd and didn't connect with the rest. Tney weren't bad, they just didn't seem to be written for the same book as the previous stories. He does have an eye for the absurd and writes good dialogue. I wasn't thrilled by this collection, but it is readable and entertaining."
1,A cheesy gimmick!,"I borrowed these video tapes from a friend of mine who purchased them back when they first came out in the late 80's They should be called ""Where there's a gimmick there's a sucker!""There's absolutley NOTHING in these videos that can ""magically"" help you get better grades! These videos help only slightly by showing you a few study procedures you probably already know (like I did) and currently use!! Bottom line, everybody has their own way of studying, but if you want to make better grades then:1. DO YOUR HOMEWORK!!!!2. Read and UNDERSTAND the textbook! Outline it if you have to. If you need to read it several times then DO SO!!3. Take good notes in class and study them in your spare time! A little less time goofing off and more time studying for a test could mean the difference between making an A instead of a B!!!There now, I told you what you need to do to make better grades and it didn't cost you a dime!"
2,Waring Blender top,We own a red blender and could not find a replacement the same color. We ordered black and it already developed a crack in the plastic top. Bummer.
5,NEEDED BAD,I purchased nice waring blender at yard sale but it had no lid which makes it useless I new I could get it on AMAZONand did. Got a great price and very fast shipping. THANKS!
5,It's what I ordered,"My old lid's plastic center piece cracked in the dishwasher the first time I washed it in there, even though the lid was supposed to be dishwasher safe. Not sure what caused this to happen, but it was not a bid deal. I just hand washed it after that. However, one day I dropped it on the floor and it cracked so badly I didn't trust it anymore to be safe. Couldn't order just the center piece, so I ordered the whole lid. It fit and all's well again."
5,Fits Model 1208,"We have an old Waring blender that is over 30, maybe over 40 years old. Unlike some of the other reviewers, we still have the original lid. However the old lid has become gross and disgusting with age. The plastic got sticky -- not because we didn't clean it, but because the plastic started to deteriorate. It gets your hands sticky just touching it, and water alone doesn't get the stickiness off. We've had old plastic storage containers do the same thing. So no one who lost or broke their lid should be too sorry about it. It's better to replace this sort of plastic lid anyway when it gets that old.Our blender says Model 1208 on the bottom and says Custom Solid State 70 on the front. I wasn't sure this lid would fit because Model 1208 isn't among the many model numbers listed in Amazon's description. But it fits just like the original one did, and it's sooooo much nicer to be using a nice new lid that doesn't make your hands sticky."
4,"Neat, but not quite cool.","Greatly serves the purpose of portable music. Won't wow the audiophile, or even the pretender, but does very nice job in my 28x32 garage, thank you.My wife borrowed it so often I've just ordered her one of her own!!"
3,Cool design and good quality but not great sound,I liked the surround sound idea but the sound quality did not live up to my expectations. It needs to have more bass and a graphic equalizer that can provide better mid-range control.Construction quality appeared to be excellent.
2,What you see is NOT what you get!,"Be aware that while the picture in the ad is definitely the Sharp EL-334AB (I know because I already own one), what you receive is the Sharp EL-334TB. I order this because I liked my current calculator so much that I wanted one for home as well. What I got was a calculator that is much bigger and clunkier and uses a kick stand instead of a tilt screen. Not what I had in mind at all. I give the vendor 5 stars for a super fast shipment, but no stars for an incorrect product description."
3,Worth sneakin' across the border for...,"Being a big Delinquent Habits fan, i decided to give this a try, (especially after hearing ""wake up show"") and wasnt hugely disappointed. ALthough i would rate I-MAN a better lyricist i'd have to say the D.Habits prodution is far better, making their tracks more appealing. That said there's 5 absolute bangers on here in the shape of ""wake up show"", ""2 many mc's"", ""provoke the extreme"", realism"" and the ""burnin' hot"" remix. There are other solid hiphop tracks such as ""u dont even know me"", ""never in this world"", ""confessions"", and ""instinct"" to make it a worthwhile album.The remaining joints however are what takes away from this. Both of SINFUL's solo tracks ""la plaga"" and ""problems"" are weak, along with ""headz or taylz"" and ""plead insanity"". Overall it's not a bad album for the 8 or 9 tracks i mentioned. Worth a listen."
4,Chinaberry Album - Worth the read.,"If you love a novel with secrets, a mystery and a descriptions that draws you into the story and keeps you wanting to turn the pages, the Chinaberry Album is the one to read. I look forward to the next work of art by Ruth Coe Chambers."
4,Mortal Engines,"The book I am reviewing is Mortal Engines by: Phillip Reeve. It is a science fiction book set in the future, where towns move and eat each other. And America was destroyed in a nuclear war. The setting is in London where an orphan boy called Tom Natsworthy lives.One day, a mysterious girl named Hester Shaw tries to kill his Idol, Thaddeus Valentine. After catching Hester, Tom expected to be praised as a hero, but instead he finds himself and Hester pushed off of the city by Valentine's own hand. Left to survive with Hester on the Out-country, Tom has no choice but to befriend her as they try to journey back to London, just as a devastating weapon was activated in London to destroy its enemies.My favorite part was when Hester's long-time enemy Stalker Grike was crushed by a town (but he survived). I give this book a rating of 4.5 because there was too much swearing, but it was still really good."
3,Very nice if you like Studio Ghibli type of steam punk adventures,"It is a light fantasy that should definitely appeal to the younger public especially due to its resemblance with some of Studio Ghibli's work like Laputa: Castle in the Sky and Howl's Moving Castle. It had a strong hold on me even though it was a bit predictable. The overall experience was quite enjoyable. The ""It's a town-eat -town world"" idea is also quite novel."
4,Beautiful Neo-Steampunk Setting,"A fabulous concept and a beautiful neo-steampunk setting quickly raises this book above the pack. The characters start out as less than three-dimensional, but fortunately grow in strength as the story continues - particularly in the final quarter. I was surprised by the grittiness displayed in the decisions of the climax, especially in light of the generally light tone of the preceding chapters. This is no deep exploration of character and theme, but overall its blithe originality makes it a winner."
4,A marvelous piece of literature,"Mortal enginesPhilip ReevesWhat if the fate of millions lay on the shoulders on a 15yr old boy?Welcome to the world of mortal engines. Traction citys rule the world, the anti traction league is trying to fight. With marvelous weapons and exiting surprises mortal engines is a modern day masterpiece. Philipe Reeves new novel dishes up a plate full of delight and surprises. a must read for grade 7 and up."
2,ultra violence,"Although Mortal Engines has a good premise and the story is gripping, I was left feeling that Philip Reeve had only one solution to any difficulty in characterization or plotting: violent death. I would not recommend this book for kids who identify with characters, nor for kids who expect any sense of justice or fair play. The plot fits better with a comic book series than with a novel.Only 2 major characters (and maybe one minor one) survive the book. Everyone else (including bit players) dies, generally without advancing the plot much.I was also offended that the 2-dimensional comic-book villians were called ""Engineers""."
3,DECENT,"Interesting story. This book moves at a quick pace, and is tough to set down, similar to an anvil. The whole ""into the future"" theme is way overplayed, and I plan to have a nice chat over tea and scones with Phillip Reeve about it. Even so, the plot was fun, and you learn to love the characters. I was disappointed by the book's apparent lack of a good sex scene... whatever. I guess all the little kids wouldn't be to thrilled with one, but really, it is just part of life (and makes a book much interesting!!!) I would have given this book four stars, but I read ""The House of the Scorpion"" one day later. If you were wondering, that book is awesome, and twice as good as ""Mortal Engines."" I plan to read the sequal to Mortal Engines... eventually. Listen to the song ""One in a Million"" by Guns N' Roses. It is one of my favorite tunes these days. MERRY CHRISTMAS!!!"
3,Awaited Yet I Still Hesitate,"This cd fans have waited years for. It is smooth sounding has quite a few good tracks, my favorite being Solitary Man. Mr. Carey's voice was meant for this song, yet others such as Mrs. Lincoln....well that's up to the true fan who will enjoy anything and everything. My favorites on the cd being Matchgirl, Only the Young and A Long Way From Home, of course along with Solitary Man. So Four songs out of 14 is pretty good, seeing these days when we do buy a cd any cd that you want an original of, falls into the same category, no matter who the artist. I do like the hidden track as well, a funky kind of song, that was a surprise to all. Okay so I've moved up to five songs, better yet. I purchased this cd second hand from a friend who had purchased two, one for a friend, but the friend had no good things to say pertaining to the cd. So I review and give three stars for the tracks and also production quality."
4,"Tony's not left us yet, ...","...in fact, he's getting stronger with the help of the internet spreading his music samples to new listeners. This album easily fits into almost everyone's music collection. It has both ballads and up tempo songs. Tony has given us a full platter with this even without the (*surprize extra track*) and his voice is unmatched. The album opens up very strong with a cover of Neil Diamond's ""Solitary Man"" and doesn't drop much from there. Other highlights are ""Only The Young"", ""Boystown"", and ""Mrs. Lincoln."" You really get a sense of appreciation for this album while reading the liner notes during your first listening and finding out he does everything or nearly everything himself. One thing keeps this from getting 5 stars and that is hearing bits from his yet to be released Planet P Project album ""Go Out Dancing"", shows he has even better music in the wings. This album is a Must Have, but then again, since you've already searched for Tony Carey, you already know that."
4,Good cd,"This is a good cd by tony carey. Only one hard rocker on here..A long way from home. The other songs that I like on here are when it all said and done, boystown, matchgirl, looking at the moon..I mean all are good I just like these better. It might not be around too much longer...the boystown tapes so if you don't have a copy it would be a good idea to pick up one."
3,The Boystown Tapes....mmmmmm???,"I bought this cd and I loved it, I played it over and over and it never left my cd-tray for about....a week. I only have 7 of Tony's cds and I haven't lost interest in any of those, I love playing his music, his voice is just awesome. But this disc wore me down. I don't play in much anymore. Some really good songs on there though and I bet fans with all his music love every track, and I did too, at first, but it fades into the obscure file when something better comes along. My favorite song is matchgirl on the cd and that I can listen to over and over, and Neil Diamond would love the way Tony plays Solitary Man, can you imagine the two of them singing together!!! Wow. Well I bought the cd and I guess I helped pay for it in a sense and thats not a problem, but as I said, it becomes very, lazy if thats okay to say, because half way through now I just want to take it off."
5,A Breath Of Fresh Air In These Times Of Musical Stagnation,"Tony Carey is a creative genius who does his own thing. Thats why his music is so good. But unforunately the general public only listens to what ""everyone else is listening to."" The music on Boystown Tapes comes from the heart and uplifts it. So open your minds out there and don't miss out on this. Good Luck und Machts Gut Tony."
3,"Boystown, well, perhaps written...","Boystown Tapes only stands up for fans who actually craved Tony Careys music, I have his collection, plus many rare tracks, some even unreleased, and I own Boystown Tapes. It lacks a certain feel that Carey's music has had, the punch of songs that remain in your memory. Upon first play, sounded great because for that one reason it was new. Yet the more I played Boystown Tapes, the more I felt myself moving away from it and playing earlier cds such as Cold War Kids and the Long Road, and Go Out Dancing by Planet P Project, Live in Austin Texas. These cds do and will stand the stay of time. Boystown has some tracks that will as well, despite all else it does complete my collection of studio released music of Tony Carey."
2,Rather disappointing,"As the previous review states, this album is not primarily Rieu and his orchestra (whom I love!). Lots of vocals, some of which are not even very good. ""Gesu Bambino"" is sung at such a quick pace that it loses its beauty, IMHO. The children's group from Nagasaki is charming, but I wasn't after this kind of recording when I saw Rieu's name on the recording. Had I realized what this was like, I would have just remained content with what I bought last year. Caveat Emptor!"
3,good...not great,"Parts one and three were the most insightful and intriguing. The stratgic planning process was well defined and provided a framework for how to 'think', rather than a guide to planning. Part three, which is about the infamous 3 C's, was too light on content. The high level overview of the 3 C's in this section left me with little information about how to effectively use the 3 C's. Lastly, many of the examples are very outdated. It would be helpful if Omhae updated it to reflect the recent history of the Japanese economy and its impact on their corporations."
3,A good insight but could have contributed more,"The author has been successful in giving readers an insight into what makes the Japanese tick from a cultural, economic and industrial perspective. The major shortfall however, is that book seems to suggest that the Japanese model is the benchmark for many western businesses to emulate.My feeling is that the book could have contributed more by hypothesising a model that embeds the strengths of both Japanese and Western models to achieve optimum outcomes. After all, continous improvement strategies that many Japanese businesses embrace are hardly drivers for major technological break-throughs. Conversely, many US-based companies are excellent at large-scale investment in major R & D programs (and subsequent patenting) that secure long-term competitive advantage."
3,Realistic and very humorous view of the Vietnam War,"Even before the dust settled on the Vietnam war, along comes an author who really nailed the entire war in a humorous and realistic way. This book is not filled with blood and guts nor the ""have pity on me, I'm a Vet"" view of the war. It is more along the lines of the stuff the every day GI had to endure, the real life, often too stupid to even talk about. I rate this book top shelf!"
4,Great Biker Hiker Gadget!,"This little e-mail device/service is a great, inexpensive, easy way to maintain contact with friends while on the road or in the wilderness and it also provides a way to log your biking and hiking trips and send them to your regular e-mail address. At 7 oz. and reguiring only two simple A batteries, it couldn't be lighter. Bike around the world with Al Young. a music teacher from Idaho who is on the year-long Odyssey 2000. She routinely sends her logs to an Internet buddy via the TM20. She loves this computer."
4,Wonderful,"This is a wonderful device. For people who just need to keep in contact by email. However if you are a person wanting to get into the net its not for you. But for email this is wonderful. You don't have to hook up to any phone lines. Just use a cell phone, pay phone or whatever you want. I recommend getting this very much"
3,Good Product !,"Good idea for storage however the steps do not hold the average wide can, so that you can only store small tins, or small bottles or little boxes."
3,Arrived on time,The old seal got stretched & started leaking & this one works great although I'm sure we'll have to replace it again down the road.It was supposed to be a pack of 2 but I only received one!
3,good...but,"I was eager to get this book, based on the customers reviews. The design principal (a 4 patch block consisting of half-square triangles) is very well presented, with good instructions to create 15 different quilts. The idea that this one block could be - if desired - arranged into 256 possibilities was startling. However, I found most the pictured quilts to be primarily dark, rather garish, and quite busy - thereby ""loosing"" the basic design. If you use just the quilt diagrams as inspiration, I think you might make some lovely quilts."
2,"Look good, not so reliable","I purchased 4 strings of these lights. They appear to be fairly well made and have a very nice icy appearance. The bluish tint of the white LEDs goes well with the bright blue LEDs.Bad news is that one section of lights on one string was dead out of the box. I didn't see a way to mess with the LEDs themselves, they seem permanently in place. After hanging the lights, that section would occasionally light up. Then a section on another string went out. I haven't been able to get that section going again. Two failures out of four strings is not a good track record, and suggests to me that there is something systemically wrong here."
2,several nonfunctional leds,Between my son and I we bought 8 strands. There were two to four burned out lights on every strand. I like the appearance of the lights but the quality control seems very poor. I would not buy this brand again.
4,Love these lights!!!,"Well I dont know what the problem was with the other Reviewers lights but other than the fact that these are short (11' of useable light length), I had absolutely no complaints at all!!I strung 4 of these together for my home and the mix of Blue/White leds are great! I had, hands down (IMHO), the brightest looking icicles on my street.These are sharp looking, eye catching lights that you can spot at some distance. and because they're LEDs, I didn't feel bad leaving em on all damn night during the Christmas season.Wonder that the other colors must look great too?All lights were functional, no burnouts, and it rained on em for at least half the time they were up and no problems."
2,Disappointed,"With my husband's family being Finnish-American, our love of the U.P. and my fondness for mystery books I thought this would be an ideal mid-winter story to settle in with for the night. How very disappointed I was.The writing style is somewhat disorienting, the who-done-it blatantly obvious from the beginning of the book, and the constant repetition of prattling by the characters unneeded.Save your money and your time."
4,Why i like it,It is a simple total emersion system that gets you thinking in latin. and. tthinking in a language is the key to learning that language!
3,Not a Primer,"When you learned to read English (e.g. Dick and Jane) you already knew how to speak it, albeit not well. What you did not know is what words looked like in print.This book tries to emulate your primer reading experience, but you have a problem opposite to that of a first grader. Here are the words; but how do they flow? Ergo, you wind-up deciphering rather than translating.Still it exposes you to a lot of reading and new words and word constructions, especially if you continue with Part II."
5,dog's love this,"My nine dogs love these, they do chew up pretty quickly however the dura chew was breaking there teeth so i much rather replace more often."
2,Potentially dangerous,"My dog is an average chewer and he was able to tear chunks out of this immediately. I took it away from him because I didn't want him to choke on pieces or swallow them. Sadly, it was a waste of money."
2,Not as advertised,"I ordered this item, and it arrived quickly. However, the item is not as advertised. It says it has a ""temperature display"", which sold me, and also which is incorrect. I called PyleAudio about this and the gentleman confirmed that it does not have such a feature. He said that he has installed a ton of these items, and acknowledged that the description on Amazon and their own website was inaccurate for this product and their other product (PLPSC8) which says that it too has a temperature display. I will be returning this item as it is not what I need nor expected. One star for inaccurate product description, 2 stars because this may just work as an adequate backup system if that is all that you want or need, but 5 stars for the PyleAudio gentleman's honesty."
1,Rear wind deflector catches window when closing window - does not work,The rear window deflector does not allow the rear windows to close without binding. I'm very dissapointed in the quality and functionality of the product. Feels cheap and doesn't work well.
1,Looks like plastic I recycle from my daughters barbie dolls,Do not waste your money. I gave this item as a gift and I feel absolutely foolish for doing so I thought it would be a hard plastic box that fit nicely into a drawer. I turned out to be flimsy plastic that looks like the top of the security wrapping of my daughter's barbie dolls. It's a total waste of money.
2,Plastic Box,This product is just a plastic box. Nothing spectacular about the organizer. One would think it is sturdy but not. Would not purchase.
4,You can see him on PBS or own your own in home trainer.,"Uncle Matty is reconized by many for his PBS specials and Animal Planet shows. I have seen him live in Boston. This video is one of his many training videos. Seeing celebrities having some of the same dog problems we do can be amusing. Uncle Matty uses an ""Uncle Matty's proud"" line with the dogs. It can make you giggle or cringe. When you see that the voice works on the pooches in the video, you try it on yours. Amazing it works. Sit back, relax and rewind or pause if you want to. You will watch it over & over and will likely being sharing with your friends. Enjoy."
2,Too much choker correction,"I really wanted to like this video. I liked Uncle Matty himself. But he seems to use the same choker correction approach to almost every dog. In some cases, he seems to be training the dogs to disobey their owners. (He has the owner call the dog, and he corrects it for obeying.)I also don't think choker correction is going to help a dog that has fear aggression. How could that help the dog to trust people more? It might be afraid to bite him, but it hasn't solved the poor dog's problem."
2,Not that impressed,I used this product on my lips to stop inflamation and felt little to no vapor effect that i was expexting Others did like it because it soothed their indigestion
2,Disappointed,"I remember seeing and hearing Toto Cutugno singing L'Italiano at the 1983 San Remo Music Festival when I lived in Italy. I loved that song, full of pride in his nation and tongue-in-cheek jabs at his homeland. So 24 1/2 years later I decided to buy his Greatest Hits CD. I wish I hadn't. It destroyed a lot of memories. L'Italiano is still what it was when I first heard him sing it. The rest of the album is almost a throwaway. There are one or two other bright spots, but by and large, all the songs blend into a techno mush, none of them really standing out from the other. If you really want to own a copy of the song L'Italiano, maybe there's a less expensive way, or a collection with other artists that makes it a better investment. The two stars I gave this CD are entirely because of the presence of my favorite song."
3,"Good shows, but the audio and video quality mars the experience","This collection has a healthy dose of Dragnet, Martin Kane and others. There is a lot of television on these DVDs, and more than once I've decided to do a TV detective marathon but couldn't make it through more than 3 or 4 before I just got worn out with the bad audio and video quality. These aren't restored - that's why they're inexpensive. I will say I watch black and white 30s-50s movies all the time, so it's not the black and white or any of that, it's just that they aren't restored.Overall, I'm glad I bought them and it's fun to pop one in occasionally."
4,This band rocks!,"Put this CD inyour regular play list-great big sound with cool lyrics.The vocals are nice with beatle type harmonies.Nothing fancy, just in-your-face rock -n- roll. Excellentfor a debut release!"
5,A Memphis mix--better each time you listen!,"This CD showcases a great Memphis mix of Southern pop and Delta bluesy rock. The band grabs you with its first cut, ""Walking on the Edge,"" and doesn't let go. The lyrics are intelligent, the tunes memorable, the songs varied. From the catchy ""All Because of You"" to the romantic ""State of Mine"" to the rousing ""Swing Me,"" this is a CD that sounds better each time you listen. Congratulations to the Tumblin' Sneakers!"
1,so-so,"Small tub of this gunk was a bit too dry to cover my bulldog's pills. he didn't seem to like the smell or taste either (he spit it out, but he's pretty picky)."
2,it's o.k. but not great,"for someone who has prior knowledge of finale, it is probably informative. But for someone like myself, who wanted to understand the basics, the book was not very helpful. Overall, the book lacked consistency in providing information - some parts were very detailed, while other parts presumed the reader already knew a lot."
3,Bought for class in college,My oldest daughter had to have this text book for a class in college. She liked the class and the book. Very helpful book.
1,International Version,"Be aware before you order this that this is the international version of the textbook. On the back of the book it says that it contains content different from the North American version and that it is not to be sold in North America. There is nothing on this product page that tells you this and I am very disappointed that Amazon would sell me a book the publisher says not to. Thanks to Amazon I will now be behind in my class in the first week! Very frustrating, be sure to not order this if you live in North America."
3,Theories of Personality,"This book was 5th edition. I actually entered that I wanted the 7th or 6th and when I bought it, it was the 5th. It would be nice if that distinction had been made in the product information."
2,theories of personality,i didn't receive my order and it took almost 3weeks and i still didn't receive it. seller keep in touch when i emailed him about it but couldn't fix the problem. so decided to get my money back
3,Theories of personality,It's an ok book. I needed it for a psych class. Has tons of information in it.
3,It's an International Version,"I bought this book on Amazon new because it was only a few dollars more than the used books advertised here. However, when I received the book, I realized it was an international version. Now, I have used international version textbooks before and I don't mind that at all. However, it was not advertised on Amazon.com as an international version. I could have bought an international version at another website for less money. I didn't appreciate that. Other than that, the book is new and I read a few pages and liked the layout. I just wished I would have known it was an international version."
5,Adventure,Descriptive stories take you to remote Alaska and show you the real life you would never see from a tour bus. Not necessarily a trip for vegetarians though.
4,"Good, not great","Mr. Jans has always held something back in his writings of the Arctic for one reason or another. But for many years his (and later Seth Kantner's) voice was the only one on the tundra. This work, for example, is 23 chapters long. It covers many of the realities of Bush life, but not all. What if there was a 24th chapter? What would it tell us? Read The Tundra Diary by Roman Acleaf to find out."
5,Delicious and Nutritious,"I bake bread weekly, much of the time it's rye or pumpernickel. Well, these crackers will give my bread machine a well deserved break because they are fantastic! I usually eat Dr. Kracker's or Ak Mak's, but now I have a new favorite. The Ryvita is the perfect size for an open-faced snack or a crisp crackers encasing stuff sandwich. I have had no problem with them falling apart but then I don't pile them with huge amounts of food; I simply use a thin spread like goat cheese, baba ganoush or hummus w/ veggies, cheese, salmon, or faux poultry products. They are made of rye, salt and H20, nothing more, and they are not as rigid as Dr. Kracker's, but much stronger than Ak Mak's. They are just right and Amazon offers them for a terrific price! I'm hooked."
5,"Yum! Great taste, no unnecessary ingredients.","My favorite cracker. I like it better than the light rye and better tha Wasa light rye. Deep rich taste and only rye flour and water. How do they make this? I'd like to make it at home since it only has 2 ingredients. I have food allergies, that's why I buy these."
4,A pianist must balance her art with love! True biography!,"This unusual and hard to find biographical novel concerns Clara Wieck, of Liepzig, Sweden, an infant prodigy when the great composer, Robert Schumann began to study music with her father. He was a welcome guest at the family home until he proposed marriage to Clara - when her father banished him! He didn't want anything to spoil her talent and gift to the world.For 4 years she continued to give concerts and recitals, before realizing that she had to completely defy her father to marry her one true love. She was in her teens! What a way to ruin her life and her artwork!But this author seems to think it was fine and dandy, so, whatever.Rare Swedish novel written in English."
5,educational,"A very good book for introducing one to Buddhism. Good history, good photots, good order of events."
4,fun,This is a fun movie that everyone can watch without the worries of today's unmodest and lanuage and adult situations. It has good morals and makes you smile.The description on movie is really clear. I thought the two missionaries that are the real ones were funny and the two imposters were pretty fun together.
4,the ride to dinah's wedding,"I wasn't sure which character to like more - Seth, Dinah, Tripp or Addie. I loved them all. What a ride. It took a few pages to get into the spirit of the ""ride"", but then I was hooked. I used it as a beach book and was glad to have uninterrupted time to read it. The old adage - ""It is the journey, not the destination"" really applies here. The tone of the book matched the subject, light and breezy. I would recommend it to anyone (women mostly) who wanted a lighthearted romp with some people who were discoverying themselves as much as they are discoverying each other."
5,shame on you,"I love these picks. I am severely disabled and can't get to any music store so I am forced to buy something worth more than 25 dollars to get these picks? You might want to see how much of everything I have bought from you after losing the use of my legs. I spend a lot of money at Amazon.Music is all I ever wanted to do. Now it is all I can do. I've always bent backwards to solve any disputes, have gone so far as to not ask for money back on at least 2 articles that were so completely wrong it wasn't worth it, so I let it go, in YOUR favor just to be nice.Steve Buffington"
1,Don't Waste your $$$$$,I bought this album thinking this was going to be an honest to goodness serious artist. IT'S HORRIBLE!!!!!! Please don't waste your money like I did. To tell you the truth it's not worth the plastic it was wrapped in. I'm going to throw it away. Lynn...give it up!
4,Great Yoga Video,"I really enjoy this video. The opening positions seems especially helpful for labor and delivery. The strength excercises are challenging for me because I am not very flexible, but they are doable. The relaxation part in the end is wonderful. My only complaint is there is no music during the workout. Some people may enjoy that though!"
2,Disappointing,"This video only works if you can dedicate an entire hour a day to Yoga. I had been hoping for a more practical '3 x 20 mins' incorporating some stretching & active poses + ending with relaxation in each session. Also, I had anticipated a short preview on the 'do's and 'don't's of yoga during pregnancy. On the whole, I found the video very uninspiring!"
3,A disappointing experience,"I had taken several yoga courses just before getting pregnant and wanted to continue. This video was disappointing. I was surprised there was very little warm up or stretching especially before beginning some strenuous positions. I also found the variety of positions to be limited, even taking into account physical limitations of pregnancy. I would absolutely not recommend this for a beginner.This video did have some excellent qualities. I appreciated the hints and suggestions for modifying the positions for differing levels of ability. I liked the non-spiritual, practical tone. Overall, it was a peaceful, inspiring exercise tape. The ending, relaxation sequence was great.It would have been nice to be able to skip the ""how to"" parts of the video in order to shorten the workout time once you are familiar with the routine. Maybe run the entire workout again, but without the explanations?"
3,"excellent postures, but terrible production","This video has some excellent yoga postures for pregnant women. Colette explains what each is for, however, the separate instructions she gives and demonstrates for each posture take too long and are repeated when the tape switches to the group of pregnant women. Other yoga videos I have just seamlessly blend the verbal instructions into the video.Because the tape takes too long (a little over 60 minutes), I am not motivated to do it very often. However, after doing the workout several times, I can do the moves I need without watching the video whenever I have the time. For instance, when I wake up in the middle of the night with a backache, or while watching TV, or upon getting home.For a tape this expensive, one would expect better production values. Instead, we see a plain set with an occasional fly getting in the screen, and no music."
3,"Good exercise, poor aesthetics","This tape is very good at some basic and not-so-basic yoga poses like ""Down Dog"", adapted suitably for pregnant women. My only concern in this department is that the tape does a twist and a half-shoulder stand - I'm not sure these are good for pregnancy, as other tapes suggest not doing them. I like that she explains the physical benefits of many of the postures. And the opening and stretching postures really pushed me.I did not care for the look and feel of this workout. There is no music. The studio set is uninspiring. And with each posture, it is first shown to you with a model alone, there is a pause, then the other members in the class perform it in a totally different room. It's very redundant and there is no continuity."
4,Very good video even for beginners,"I purchased this tape and have used it three times so far and have *really* enjoyed it. I am very newly pregnant with my 4th child and know for certain that this video is going to give me strength I never had before in my earlier pregnancies. My first reaction was ""this sissy yoga stuff is hardwork!"" I am not in very good shape, I'm ""kinda"" overweight and I cannot believe I was able to perform the positions shown on this tape. I feel so strong! Colette gives us the proper name for each position and shows us exactly how to do them. The tape does take an hour, but it is designed for you to learn each position so you can perform them independent of the video. I strongly recommend this video for anyone who wants to gain strength and stamina and have a renewed sense of well being."
5,great stretch and relaxation video,"Colette is brilliant! She has captured the same connection with pregnant women in her video as she does in her classes. She speaks with knowledge, she moves with awareness, and carries herself with the confidence she has earned while creating her life's work and passion. Colette Crawford teaches with an open mind and even though this is a video you can sometimes feel her presence right there in your living room. Her voice is soothing and relaxing, one I've heard to have been with many women during childbirh who have experienced a relaxtion with Colette. This video is great if you want to do a 70 minute workout or if you only have 20 minutes. A few opening poses here, a few strengthening poses there or you can even focus on just one section at a time. I really enjoyed how Colette designed the sequencing of this video, I'm hoping she will soon come out wit a Postnatal Yoga with infant Video Too!"
1,A misrepresented VCR,"This is a poor VCR for the following reasons: 1. 19u micron head does not provide better quality picture in EQ mode if anything the picture quality is worst. I mean it. It is. 2. its true that the picture is sharp. but the sharpness reveals the ""snow"" and other distractions of a videotape."
2,Poor construction,"I just received the Leather PodSleeve protector manufactured by Digital Lifestyle Outfitters today and must say that I am somewhat disappointed by its construction. It is very flimsy (the swivel clip casing feels almost certain to snap) with a quality of leather is so low you wonder what type of animal it was sourced from. Although it is not included in the product description, it is designed for 3G 30 and 40 GB iPods (I have a 20 GB). Not a big issue as I'm going to get another. Save yourself about $10 and get the MARWARE 3G Neoprene iPod Sportsuit instead. I had bought one for my sister and found it to be much more sturdy in construction, and despite being constructed of neoprene, being much nicer in appearance than this street vendor quality leather case (that they're chargining $24.88 for!)."
3,"Very engaging, but has guided mantra/meditation portion some might not like for a child","My 3-year-old daughter loves to work out with me to my DVDs, and I bought this for her to begin some stretching and yoga. She loves watching and copying other kids. However, as a Christian family, we skip the first portion of the workout which is a mantra meditation (the names of the Hindu goddesses chanted over and over by the leader and children for 2-3 minutes)."
3,KidYogi kind of cheesy,"This video is difficult because many times the children are being shown doing the poses (which my child likes), but they are doing them incorrectly some of the time and it isn't helpful."
1,Yawnfest,"1)Boring. 2)A bit too hari-hari for our taste. 3) We bought this for our 9 & 10 year old sons to do with their mother. There is one little boy in it, and he is off-screen most of the time."
1,Disappointed in Kid Yoga...,"My daughter was excited to receive this, she loves doing Yoga with Mommy, but it was a disappointment, very boring, didn't hold her attention... she is five years old, we would NOT recommend this."
1,Try something else,"Worked great for the first week; then got stuck in the coarse-grind mode. After about a month all that falls from the mill are huge, unevenly cracked chunks of pepper. A real disappointment for the money. My 10-year old, dime-store pepper mill does a better job at this point."
2,Good while it lasted...,"Bought the salt & pepper set about a year ago; the pepper mill is shot. It's not locking in one grind; it no longer works on any setting. I use several peppers mixed, including long pepper, which is quite hard; i thought this mill would be strong enough. Apparently not. Will look into coffee mills..."
5,"I GIVE IT A -5 ""WELL IT WAS"" IT BROKE","I have been looking for a good pepper mill for some time and this one is the best I have ever usedAnd I have bought so many that I gave up on them until I got this one""WELL IT WAS"" IT BROKE. for the money if it is going to brake that quick i soon buy cheeper ones and save money"
4,Great smelling anti-bacterial wipes,We use these almost everyday on our bulldog for all the folds and the scrapes he gets into. It's pleasant smelling and more importantly works to keep the folds clean. Our bulldog hated the smell of the medicated antibacterial wipes we got from the Vet and would run away every time we tried to use them. He lets us wipe him off with these and when he gets cuts they heal pretty quickly.
1,Doesn't Work with Windows Vista,This game doesn't work with Windows Vista (won't install). I will try again after I upgrade to Windows 7.
1,Avoid!!,This has to be the worst mix I have ever heard. The tracks are nailed together!! Whilst they represent the camp side of the 1980's the quality of the mixing is truly dreadful. This first album which dealt with Italo disco was fantastically mixed by Ben Leibrand. What the hell happened here!! Save your money and buy a decent unmixed compilation instead
5,This really is the GOOD LIFE,"Two great albums on one CD. Buddy's backed by great musicians like Shelly Manny, Dave Grushin, Joe Mondragon and Bud Shank. Desafinado, the good life and Call me irresponsible are 6 stars. Songs for swingin'losers is perfect when you're lover is gone. Special Blame it on my youth!! And what a great piano player!"
5,Unique blend of hits bring pleasure,I was so impressed how Gigliola's clear and beautiful singing voice blends so well with the orchestra. I just want to jump up and dance when I hear the re-arranged version of Alle Porte del Sole. I remember this song on an album I bought of hers in 1974. A very enjoyable CD to own.Kevin from Minnesota USA
4,Ari Ben-Manashe's experience,"An excellent well documented book by a high level Israeli agent. I have to give Sheridan Square Press's publishers Ellen Ray & Bill the Credit for the content as the author did the same. Most of us out of the publishing, or, media business are not skilled writers. Sheridian Square Press out of N.Y., N.Y. did the same service for the deceased Jim Garrison in his book ""On the Trails of Assassins"" documenting events leading up to the events of the Kennedy asassination that Oliver Stone made a movie of."
2,street fighter,for street fighter fans only. this is not an anime. the story is ok but what really makes me mad is that they re-released it on the new street fighter movie so now i have two copies.
1,"Not a movie, just still panels on the screen!","Just FYI, this isn't a movie, its a series of still panels moved around on your screen like a flash animation. There is dialogue and sound effects, but no motion. Very disappointing."
1,Just get the comics,"As a huge fan of Udon and their Street Fighter series, I have to say, this is HORRIBLE! It's some of the worst voice acting I have ever heard in my life. I have no clue as to why they felt the need to make this. What? People are too lazy to read comic books now? It's terrible. Get the comics. Skip this."
5,Absolutely necessary in today's confusing world,"I actually have not read this book, but the authors came to my school and gave a talk about the book. I think that cliques are horrible, and this book educates us about the dangers they have and why we should stop them. As soon as I can, I'm going to try to find a copy of this and read it."
5,"The Best ""How To Write"" Book Ever Written","Robert Boice uses years and years of experience dealing with the psychology of writers to finally expose EXACTLY HOW writers journey to comfort and fluency. This book discusses the psychological traps writers fall into, the corners they back themselves into, and how to get out of them. With real-world examples and actual how-to exercises, this book reveals how writers think and work, and gives them the tools to solve real writing problems. The author deals with everything from procrastination to writing rituals to creating a positive working environment for ultimate fluency and comfort. It's truly a godsend for writers who want to understand themselves and expand their knowledge of the universal problems writers face."
4,Very pretty!,"This is a very nice sweetener holder, much nicer-looking than the ordinary square ones. It appears to be good quality, the edges are not sharp, everything seems to be done well. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is that I think it's a little bit over-priced."
2,Unlistenable,"I have just recently embraced jazz, and I'm really enjoying it. Miles DAvis, Wes Montgomery, Stan Getz, Dave Brubeck, Cannonball Adderly, and Chet Baker are among the artists I have collected. I know of and can hear, the genius of Charlie Parker. However this album sounds awful. I don't care how good the music is, if it sounds horrible I can't enjoy it. I'm an audiophile with a very nice stereo, give me quality recordings anyday."
1,When will this end?,"I can't believe my eyes! How could MENSA sponsor another Abbie Salny calendar? This calendar is full of errors, as it is every year. The so called puzzles fall far short of anything clever or original and it remains a huge mystery to my friends and me how something so poorly thought out could ever be published. I received this calendar as a gift and I am so disappointed that a publishing house as reputable as Workman Publishing could allow such a travesty, not to mention the high I.Q.society, MENSA!"
4,Be careful - razor sharp edge on StainlessSteel Drainer,"While this is a wonderful product - decorative and functional, I must warn you - while wiping the drainer dry so as not to accumulate mineral marks, the draining edge is razor sharp and I sliced my pinky finger at the second joint, so deep that blood gushed, and I could see ""pieces parts"" inside of the wound. After serious dressing and a splint, it healed fine, that is not the issue - the issue is that this razor sharp edge can cause a major injury to someone else. If there was a touch more pressure, I would have cut tendons and ligaments. OGGI, please fix/recall the product or remove it from the shelves. Since I paid cash and thew out the box I couldn't return it; I used a grinder to soften the edge of the drainer and kept it."
2,Designed wrong,"I purchesed this product not too long ago and whoever disigned it should take a look at the silverware basket. They sould come up with a better way to drain the silverware because the silverware basket hangs over the counter in every position I tried. Needless to say, I took it back because the basket would have drained my silverware all over my counter and not in the drain board. I think its a nice dish rack but the basket has to be redisigned to drain in the drain board and not over the counter. Looks are very decieving, in the picture it looks like the basket is over the drain board but its not. I hope this helps others before they decide to buy this product."
5,ANGEL WITH A HARP,"ONE NEVER GETS TO HEAR ENOUGH HARP MUSIC. UNFORTUNATELY THIS IS ALSO THE CASE WHEN LISTENING TO KAREN STRAUSS'S ""HARP WITH SOUL."" YOU WANT MORE! I WAS DISAPPOINTED THAT THERE WEREN'T ANY OTHER CDS SHE MADE AND LOOKING FORWARD TO HER NEXT ONE.I KEEP IT IN THE CAR ALL THE TIME, AND WHENEVER TRAFFIC STARTS TO GET HEAVY AND GETS BOONDOGGLED, I PUT IT ON TO EASE MY NERVES. WHAT A LOVELY WAY TO GET PASSIFIED.THE BIG SCREECHER"
3,Excellent? Not so much.,This thing doesn't stay in or on my ear no matter what I try. Sound quality is good if I hold it in place.
4,Very nice look. But mic quality could be better for SKYPE use.,"used it for skype. great form factor and design. but mic sound quality could be better. I compared it with a over the head headset from Labtec, and the Labtec was deemed better voice quality from the person I was talking too. good deal now though. get it while it lasts."
2,Not accurate size for a toddler,"We recently purchased a spiderman bike for our 3 year old & have been looking for a spiderman bike helmet for a while. I was so excited when I found this one- and it indicated that it was toddler size. All the toddler helmets we have tried on our son in stores have fit him (most toddler helmets say they are for either 2-4 year olds or 3-5 year olds). When we received this one my son & I were so excited- it looked so cool & matched his bike perfectly, BUT it didn't even come close to fitting him. One this package it says for toddler - 1 year+ ! It fit my 8 month old better. I was so disappointed that I had to return it (not to mention how upset he was). So, although it looks really cool & matches Marvel spiderman theme, it does not fit a typical 'toddler'."
3,Helmet very small,"They really need to put the measurements on the ad for these types of things (maybe they do by now). This helmet was too small for any of the grandkids, maybe would fit a 1 year old. We gave it to someone outside the family."
2,Item titled wrong,"This item is meant for 1+ years babies and not for toddlers - i bought it for my toddler who is 3 years and it did not fit him so had to return - had bought it through credit card so 10% service charge was applied which i consider as my loss and have a sour feeling in my mouth as the product description was not upto the mark. No where in the entire description it is mentioned that this product is for babies - also there were no close up pictures of the product anywhere on the website - had it been there, this would have been easy to catch as on the item box 1+ years is written... hope someone will look into this and do the needful...Paresh Kurani510-378-4124"
1,Too small in size for age given in description,I purchased this for my grandson age 2. The helmut was ok but the knee and elbow pads were horrible. They are made cheaply and did not even fit at all! When trying them on that squeezed and pinched his knees and elbow and he experienced a lot of pain. I was so disappointed I couldn't even bother to pay the shipping to return the item.
4,very good buy,"I have one of these Canon Snappy camera's.... and I am very pleased with the photo's I have got with this camera. You cant go wrong, buying this camera, except that it is zoomless, and you need a good expensive film, for best results."
2,Doesn't keep the ants out,"This jar looks nice and all of the other reviews are accurate. Still, the top doesn't seal which allows bugs in. This is not ideal for the storage of honey anywhere that bugs may be in the vicinity."
2,Bummer,"Bummer of a product, looks cute but the fact that the top does not snap in place makes it messy."
5,Lovely and fuctional,Looks great and works great! We always wash ours by hand so the acrylic doesn't get scratched. Shows of the beautiful amber color of our honey and keeps it from getting too messy.
3,Honey pot,"I was hard to find a honey pot, this looks great, but the top does not fit snug, not sure if that is the way it is suppose to be."
3,Neat read for an evening.,"I enjoyed the full 3 in this series ""Superman vs. Aliens"". Good artwork and the story does move along nicely. A bit of a forced mash-up, yes, but it ""worked"" for me though hard to describe why. I would recommend it to fans as one for a small collection if you are going into that, being rather unique in mixing these two elements, even if for Superman lore it's a reuse of an existing alien from other parts of the world of sci-fi. Recommend."
5,Anger and Passive,Great look into what is going on in some mens minds. Why they act out the way they do and what each person caught up in the mess can do to make good decisions on how to go forward.
4,Classics!,"These are two nice old John Wayne movies. They definitely are way better than his old ""B"" movie days. They are very enjoyable movies, and definitely worth seeing!"
5,Perfect in every way,Arrived quickly and was exactly as described by the seller. Good communication by the seller. Will buy from this seller again.
2,Mrs. Blue Bird saves the day,"I bought this CD thinking that the songs, production, harmonies, or something would have been along the same lines as The Ballroom considering Curt Boettcher's involvment.....WRONG! In MY opinion Mrs. Blue bird is the only worthwhile song on this disc, and it itself is only a marginal song, sorry. I was hoping they weren't going to be some rip off of The Sunshine Company. They're not at all, but maybe should have been. I guess I was hoping for something that rocked a little bit, or had some killer harmonies, or some off the wall arrangements, or was at least up-tempo sometimes. Again, in MY opinion, besides Blue Bird, the songs are very draggy and slow. I've tried, I've listened to the disc serveral times to give it a change to grow on me. Not going to happen. My apologies."
3,Unfortunate use of horns...,"Sorry, brass doesn't belong with Psychedelic Folk/rock. A few gems in here, notably tracks 11, 17, 12, 21, 20, 3, and 6. Track 20 is destroyed by stupid sound effects...though understandable at the time (""save the planet"" message ad nauseum). Sunshine Pop is a good label for this group, though track 18 sounds much like Jefferson Airplane. A lot of it sounds like early 70's bubblegum so I guess in some ways this group was ahead of its time. Unnecessarily long liner notes describe 3 seperate times this group missed ""the big time"" but I think it was 3 times too many. They have a quality sound but the songs just aren't there. You would do better with Love Generation or Free Design, or better yet, Saggitarius if you really want to psyche out."
1,Blasphemy!,"Wish I could give it 0 stars. The man was not a ""Dr"" and only used a handful of verses taken out of his interpretation to state Jesus isn't God. There ads hundreds of verses saying Jesus is God. It's too bad ppl dont know what ""Son of God"" means John 5:17,18 will yell you. Jesus is the I Am, the first and the last the alpha and the omega. Wierewille didn't believe Jesus existed until he was born. Well look at John 8:58 and 17:5. John 1 also tells you but he interpreted his way. Bible warns of many false prophets deceiving many. Mr. W. taught doctrines of devils. The Holy Ghost is God too. Just as Paul said the Spirit of the Lord raised Jesus from the dead and we know God raised Jesus from the Dead. His deity is also in Acts 5 where He was lied to and Peter recognizes God as the one being lied to."
2,Hilariously bad.,"Wierwille's thesis must be taken seriously. His book must not.Although he makes an attempt at being reader-friendly, he does so at the expense of sound proof of his thesis. This is a laughably bad book, and its primary usefulness lies in reassuring you if you already agree that Jesus Christ is not God.A much more comprehensive attempt at addressing this issue can be found in Anthony Buzzard and Charles Hunting's ""The Doctrine of the Trinity: Christianity's Self-Inflicted Wound"" and the book ""One God and One Lord"" by former Wierwille followers John Lynn, John Schoenheit and Mark Graeser. Of course, defenses of the Trinity doctrine can be found in any Christian bookstore.If you're going to disagree with the Trinity or try to disprove it, Wierwille's book should be your last resource."
4,Bought as a Gift,"This was purchased as a gift for a guy who has everything for his motorcycles. He was thrilled with it, and dove right in."
3,Not exactly looks as on the picture,"My husband has owned this suit for about three months; it is a fancy European style suit. But, when we received it, we immediately noticed that a few light color spots, which are supposed to be white (exact that we saw on the picture at amazon.com and Speedo sites) they are (unknown reason) pink. [...]"
2,didn't last long,I bought this in July 2008 and now 9 months have passed. The short has become saggy and lost its elasticity. I swim twice or 3 times a week during the period and didn't expect this could happen within a year.
5,Healthy and you can taste it,"I use this mainly for smoothies or oatmeal. In the smoothies, it provides a nutty flavor that has some grainy texture, but with how healthy it is, I can take it. I like that it is raw, organic and full of omega's..."
4,good value in middle of the road binoculars from Swift,"As advertised, the Swift 8.5X44 Audubon Waterproof binoculars are an excellent buy. I have found the optics to be very sharp and bright and have had no problems with interior fogging, despite some light rain use while birding. They are not all that heavy, but I recommend a shoulder harness rather than a neck strap. Field of view (430 feet at 1000 yards) is among the best of any binocular. These come close to matching binoculars costing 2-3 times as much, as far as optical quality goes. The only gripe I have with them is the focusing. The focusing knob is easy to find with the fingers but is somewhat stiff and hard to turn, making quick identification of birds flitting around in trees a little difficult. It's possible this problem may have been addressed in more recent models."
2,fall short,"Purchased these to replace a beloved older model of Swift Audubon's. The price was equivalent to that of several years ago, but unfortunately the optical quality was not! Outer casing had good surface for gripping and they were a bit lighter, but I had difficulty with the focusing and clarity and finally decided these were not of the same excellent quality as my older ones and gave up! New and improved does not always come true...The return went very smoothly and the refund was prompt."
3,cool soundtrack man!,"I could care less about the first 5 songs, but Frusciante's contribution to this record/film is remarkable. ""Dying Song"" and ""Leave all the days behind"" are heavy and haunting. Intense lyrical performance and mystifying acoustics by John make this a worthwhile buy."
3,I only had one issue with this book,"...and that is that when the individuals weight was mentioned it was in measurements not used by the united states, so when I read ""8 stone"", or ""4 and a half stone"" any measurement I had no idea what that was equivalent too in the US. I think that if there had been a chart, or just some sort of small reference to the break down of stones to ponds it would have helped in that area. Other than that, its a decent book, quick read, stories are told by the individuals themselves, which I like. If you have an interest in reading about eating disorders, add this to your collection."
2,Great Title,"I ""took a chance"" on this movie. If you watch it maybe you too can build a relationship based on lies and deceit."
4,Excellent,"Englishman Mark White's take on popular music composers from 1900 to 1980. Alphabetically listed for easy access- Everyone from Harold Arlen, Paul Simon to Andrew LLoyd Webber are biographed with some of their chart hits. Really enjoyable book full of great info! Even if he has little regard for Sondheim and refers scathingly to Lloyd Webber (without mentioning him directly) in his introduction."
3,probably won't win an Oscar,"i found this to be an entertaining slice of Japanese horror/camp with an obvious nod to previous films,both horror and otherwise.A definite sense of humor is evident thru-out,so i think to fully appreciate this one must bear that in mind.This is no ""art film"",but an attempt at simple fun that doesn't tax the brain.personally, i think it achieves that!"
1,NOTHING BUT LIES!,"If Margaret Sanger were still alive, she'd be able to sue for big bucks.This book is full of lies and misquotes, falsely claiming that Sanger supported euthanasia and infanticide, among other horrors. It attributes to Sanger quotes from other sources, as though they were her words.Amazon should be ashamed to sell this garbage."
1,Killer Lies,"The only thing worse than this book, is someone actually believing it to be based on facts. It is a wicked defamation of Ms Sanger's character for the author to express a pro-life platform.""No woman can call herself free who does not own and control her own body. No woman can call herself free until she can choose conscientiously whether she will or will not be a mother."" --Margaret Sanger"
1,Just more anti-birth control bias!,"From the first words it is obvious that the author has his own agenda--just as he says Margaret did! And since his agenda is to deny the basic human right to control one's life, naturally he thinks she was a ""bad person."" He is very confused & illogical in that he thinks birth control is a religious issue, not the freedom issue it is. I do not care if he wishes not to use birth control--that is his right. However, I do not want him telling me I can not. He further confuses the issue by painting Planned Parenthood as only an abortion provider. Whereas, 95% of their work is preventing abortions! Yes Mr Grant, using birth control ""religiously"" is the surest way to prevent abortions, like it or not!"
1,I load of crap,"This author has no clue what he is taking about. He is continuing to spread a lie that is only confusing people. Margaret Sanger was a great woman who fought for other women to have the right to have control over their own body.His rant on birth control is mind numbing. Birth control prevents abortions and Planned Parenthood wants to prevent abortions. Yes they provide abortions, but they also provide health services to uninsured women, fight for women to have a say to what happens to their bodies, and educates all on proper sex education. Margaret Sanger would be proud of what Planned Parenthood has become. There are much better and truthful books on Margaret then this one. I only gave this one star because it was the only way I could sumbit the review!"
4,Simply wicked,"This is exactly the sort of house that I'm looking for all the time. I never heard of Felix the Housecat until I started delving into Miss Kitten, Golden Boy, et al but am so far quite impressed. Right mix of deep house, light house, pumping beats and progressive even? Anyway, mix goes all over the place which keeps me interested. I recommend it as it's the best I've heard in a while. Somewhat of a cross between Danny Tenaglia and Daft Punk? Not exactly a party album as it tends to slow down in places bu fun nonetheless."
3,not a great mix,"Some good tracks but poor mixing, and the mix remains choppy and doesn't build. Haven't played this in a couple of years, a sure sign it's no keeper."
3,Electro,"Very good track selection ruined by questionable mixing. I mean the first 3 mixes not only aren't properly matched, the location of the mix is poor. Aside from that, great tracks. Bring back the 80's!"
3,not bad,I'm sorry but I've got to say that this album slightly disappointed me. The tunes felix has chosenare all great but I have to say for a commercial release the mixing is not very tight - pretty poor in places. Not quite what I expected from someone who makes as good a tunes as Felix.Overall though it's worth about 3 stars.
2,Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,This episode is about when jealousy spreads on between the hot yellow ranger and the sexy pink ranger.Theirs a club competition going on at angel grove and Kimberely gets no one to sign up for her club but Trini's club is off the walls so theirs a little bit of jealousy going on.Uh oh.It looks like theirs a cat fight.Plus Lord zedd has created a flower monster to send the pink ranger to her doom.
5,Go Pink Ranger!,"This video is great and I have it. Awsome episode from the Might Morphin Power Rangers series, I Remember watching this and haveing the VHS. I Enjoy This show so much!"
4,Recipe card holder,Love the nice clean look and slot at the top to hold recipe card to keep it clean.Box is too deep for cards. Cards sit too far down in the box. Stuffed the bottom to lift cards. Still difficult to get out the one you want when the box is full.
3,"Fiesta 9-5/8 inch medium vase, scarlet","The vase itself is very pretty and I really like it. However, it has two noticeable blemishes on the finish. I wish the quality control had been higher so that I wasn't sent the exact one that I got. All that being said, it seems like a hassle to mail it back and get a new one though."
2,"Nice Ideas, Dull Translation","I think the idea's of Wang Hui's book and his arguments are rather fascinating, but the translation was bogged down with run on sentences. The beginning part is basically a summary, and for all intents and purposes could be thrown out, since Wang Hui's own words are there for all to see. The last section of the book was the best, since, to me it seemed more relevant than the rest. I read this book last summer, along with several other books concerning the same subject material, and I don't think Wang Hui is the best, but he is not the worst either, but most of the problems with this book are due to the translation. Next time, use shorter sentences please!"
1,turgid and boring to read,"Few Chinese political writings translate well into English. Despite the best efforts of the traslator and editor, I was disappointed with this volume. It was turgid reading at best. The only redeeming feature about this volume is its price, especially for a hardcover. But then one buys a book for the ideas not just because it's cheap."
1,Not what I expected,"I had to use this book for a college course in East Asian Studies. I have to say this is not a very enjoyable book to read, especially for writing a research paper. The author tends to ramble, jumping from topic to topic within sentences, and uses inflated language, which is often unnecessary and makes you doze off in minutes.For my paper, I ended up looking into other books which helped me greatly. Do not read the first review for this book - it's most likely a professor who uses this book in one of his courses. Believe me, ""lost in translation"" is just skimming the surface when speaking about this book. Hope that helps."
1,There's a reason she self-published.,"I have to give Ms. Soroka this: she knows how to market. It's a pity she couldn't have put some that energy into a coherent story.From what I understand, this novel has its roots in a roleplaying game. Being a gamer myself, the influences are obvious. One can almost *hear* the dice rattling as plot points are decided.The characterization is... much like what one would expecct from characters inspired by tabletop roleplay. The language is anachronistic, not at ll in keeping with the high fantasy aim of the book. There's a lot of gratuitious sexual situations, or sex-motivated situations, and Big Evily Things that are... Evil! Because!This book was so bad, the bookstore owner tried to talk me out of buying it! Honestly, it makes Eragon look like the pinnacle of craftsmanship. I honestly cannot find one thing to recommend this book, unless it's the sheer determination of the author to promote her product, and perfect example of how not to write fantasy."
1,Wow. I mean........WOW.,"OK, so I lied. I didn't read this book. Well, I at least didn't read past the first 20 pages; but trust me, I tried. This book is shockingly horrid. The most shocking aspect of this book is that it got published. Some poor editor must have lost his job over this, and thankfully so.I wish I could give it negative stars to further reduce the average rating."
2,Problems develop over time - abnormal for Sharp,"I have this model both at home and at work. They were purchased at different times from entirely different sources. BOTH have developed gremlins. As much as I am a hard core Sharp devotee, I would not recommend this particular model. Both calculators start printing the red P(dotdotdot) line at unusual times. My work one does it here and there, on its own, out of the blue. Anywhere from one to six lines. When I try to use my home one, it does it so badly I might as well throw it away at this point. Stick to a different model, I'd say this is a part flaw they don't know about."
4,"nice jersey, but kinda cheap",speedy delivery.... decent price and product.... it just looks a bit cheap
3,It broke!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This toy is fun but the clock broke the first day and the girl on the window thing looked drunk!!!!
5,"VERY, VERY FUN","As someone who enjoys games maybe more than he ought to, I can honestly say that CoMotion is one of the best out there. It's sort of like Charades-meets-Pictionary. (Teams act out clues based on where they land on the board.) I've played a few times and have laughed hard each time. Definitely worth getting."
1,Pages missing,"The book appears to have great juicing recipes but 30 or so pages were missing. This was done in the printing process. The missing pages contained recipes that pertained to juices of oranges, therefore, no use as I grow my own and wanted it primarily for that reason."
2,cheesily monikered,"& very fruit based. not for the serious health juicer, but i suppose it's alright. still haven't made anything from it though -- not enticing enough. hmmm..."
4,Good recipes and a lot of fluff,"My wife and I bought this book because we wanted Juice recipes. We already own a juicer and we do not need to be sold on the benefits of Juicing. Nevertheless, this author, like many authors of these types of books, felt it necessary to devote a considerable portion of the book talking about why you should be juicing and the health benefits of juicing fresh fruits and vegetables. Needless to say, we ignore those portions of the book (along with the section on how to choose a juicer or how to garnish a drink). But, despite all the fluff, there are good juice recipes in this book and an excellent table which gives the nutritional statistics for individual fruits and vegetables. In addition to this the book also gives a nutritional summary for each drink."
3,BAD puns and plenty of them.,"I have a feeling the book could have been 500 pages long if they'd come up with more bad puns. A lot of the combinations are obvious, although the book is attractive and the cover photo is beautiful and it's helpful for beginners. The recipes calling for a couple tablespoons of superfine (baker's) sugar are bizarre -- I definitely didn't buy a juicer to consume refined sugar!Overall I am not impressed. It's ok. That's about the best thing I can say about it."
4,Recipes,I tried juicing without recipes and came up with good basic juices that I drank on a regular basis. Then I got this book and I enjoyed branching out into other types of drinks. Good to have one of these types of books but no need for more than that.
2,"Not completely a healthy ""juicing"" guide","My husband and I just started juicing and I was looking for some great recipes. This book does have some bright spots but in many of the recipes the author has you adding sugar, honey, or sparkling apple cider. One of the last chapters in this book is entirely devoted to cocktails...If you're looking for a super healthy juicing book you'd probably want to skip this and look elsewhere. If you're looking for a good variety of juicing recipes (and don't mind sugar or other add ins) this might do just fine for you.On the positive side, I do appreciate the nutritional breakdown located on the bottom of each recipe page."
2,Did not give me what I was looking for...far to general!,I would not recommend this book for anyone looking for specific areas of juicing...I was disappointed in the contents and should have ordered the Juicer's Bible!
1,Not enough recipes,Wasn't what I was expecting...not very many recipes. I wouldn't recommend it if your looking for a lot of recipes.
5,Juice What?,"Many ,Many recepies in this little book.Great pictues too. There are mixtures of fruits and veggies i wouln't have thought of . So far not one i did'nt like. I am new at juicing and this is a great addition to my new collection of healthy eating books.Well Done, Thank You....Austin Elliott"
3,Juice,"Well, I have to say that the book has many different ideas to use and recipes. Too many consisted of ingredients that I would not have readily available. This is the reason for the 3 stars."
1,Terrible!,"I ordered this book with the hope that it would help me to find different and unusual fruit and veggie combinations for juicing. What I found is that this book is completely uninspired, and often has duplicate recipes. (For example, if you look under ""asparagus"", you'll find three recipes. Two of them are EXACTLY the same, and the third is exactly like the others but with wheatgrass added.) It would only be helpful if you're so uncertain of juicing that you don't know what you like and are unwilling to experiment without a book telling you what to do. This book doesn't offer any inspired or unusual recipes, and certainly doesn't add anything to my juicing regime."
4,Some good ideas for fruit and vegetable drinks,I would recommend this if you have a juicer and want to try some different mixtures and are afraid to go out on your own.
3,"Some are great, some not so great....","Just like any cook book, you will find some things pretty darn awesome, and some not so great...like: ""Do I really have to drink this?"" but you do anyway, because you paid so much for the ingredients.Seems like this juicing stuff is just hit or miss. You have to experiment. It is nice to have a guide. The V-10 was awesome, and worth the cost of the book just to get this recipe.I wish there were more recipes on what to do with the pulp. I hate to put all that nutrition in my compost pile.."
2,Really? Seriously?,"If I had a dartboard labeled with various fruits and vegetables, and I tossed darts at it, I could write this book. Aside from the a few tidbits about what fruits are good for what and how to pick a ripe fruit, this book offers very little to the beginner juicer. After trying several of the ""recipes"" I soon discovered that there is no real rhyme or reason to them. Anyway, nothing special here. Give it a miss."
1,A disappointing trio,"Oops, they forgot the B-24 footage! I'm scratching my head and wondering why they titled this three cassette boxed vhs collection ""The B-24 Trilogy"" as the type receives scant screen time. I wish I had thought to time it out as I would be surprised to find it had amounted to more than ten minutes in roughly three hours of running time(I have since gone back to the trilogy and timed-out the B-24 footage, which does come in at just under ten minutes-JD). There is some interesting material on this trio but if I had wanted to watch the story of the ""mulberry"" harbors, for example, I'm sure I could have found a topic specific title. There is also a certain cheese factor involved in that the producers saw fit to use skinny little vhs cassettes recorded on the ""ep"" setting. Bravo! Talk about getting that ""just been gypped"" feeling, I think I'll look elsewhere for any subsequent B-24 or other aviation videos than from this producer."
4,"not his best, but...","i can admit that this is not naipaul's best work, but it is still a very good read. the book thrives on tension, of creating a feeling of decadence and an oncoming threat seen in every detail from the landscape to the people. reading this book will certainly make you want to read up on the current politics of a place before visiting it.i was not thrilled with the ending. i had been happy to read about the *threat* of violence and the deliverance on that threat was in a way anticlimactic. not that i am averse to violence in general, but i felt that the character had had her comeuppance, or could have had it in another way - although i guess part of the whole ethos of guerilla warfare and revolutions in general is that some people just wont listen if you are peaceful.definitely read this book. it takes a look at the role of the middle class supposed sympathizers in the face of revolt."
2,Too much of tedium,"The novel makes for tough reading. The author goes on and on with his descriptions with a laboured writing style which could be avoided. The style was so forbidding that I could not finish the book.Naipaul, is a master of the travelogue, and of the political travelogue in particular, but in Guerillas, he fails as a novelist.Some bright patches if any, in the novel, belong to his insights as an political observer rather than to his skills as a novelist."
5,An action filled adventure about Guerilla war,What can i say... it was the best book i ever read since i moved to America. As a native i think it represents our culture and heritage as no other book could. We are a dignified and respected culture and V.S. Naipaul brings these views to life.
4,Undeniably Well-written,"This is the only Naipaul work I've read, so I won't be able to juxtapose it with the rest of his more well-known titles. (Maybe that enhances the review.) This book is a sad, mournful dirge, with broken and corrupted characters, expertly portrayed and set against each other on an unnamed Caribbean island (though it is assumed by all to be Trinidad). The book gives the reader a palpable sense of foreboding, tension and despair: you know from the get-go there will be no happy ending. If this is not considered to be amongst Naipaul's best efforts, then that says much about him, since this book is reflective of a great talent."
3,Brilliant but Unpleasant,"Naipaul is an excellent writer. Most of the descriptions are evocative, if depressing, the dialogue rings true, and the characters, for all their unpleasantness, are believable. The political observations are also acute, although the passage of time has made Naipaul's political incorrectness less provocative. The book is, however, ultimately too cold and harsh to be a great work. You finish it with the uneasy sense that its ugly features, particularly the misogyny and sexual hysteria, are an all too accurate projection of its creator's mind."
2,Doesn't compare to Naipaul's best.,There are some great descriptions of the island in this book but the plot seems labored and the action too slow. It really doesn't compare with Naipaul's best books like A Bend In the River and House For Mr. Biswas.
3,Son,"Required book for college course. I haven't asked my son if it was good or not, but it was required"
3,useful but poor conclusions,Bogle has some useful ideas. Like most MBA's hedoes not know how to use mathematics or logicto come to empirical conclusions.
3,A Classic Bore,"Great book, maybe. But is it ever boring. Mutual Funds excite me (I'm a CPA), but not this book."
5,Sound advice on mutual funds,"I read this book when it first came out ten years ago at the beginning of the bull market. At the time the book had mixed reviews. One of Bogle's warning, and probably the best advice, is to watch out for funds that charge high fees and to study all the fees charged in all funds. I remember one reviewer feeling that Bogle was overreacting to the fees that funds charged and that fund managers are really on our side. Fast-forward to today, we have the mutual fund scandal and we learn that mutual fund managers aren't really working on our best interests. Though reading this book can't help you spot all the bad apples ( the Janus family has alot of no-load funds and it was implicated in the scandal) it can help you be aware and thus be more weary. In a nutshell, this book is comprehensive,honest and prescient. John Bogle is the conscience of the mutual fund industry."
3,Good Source of Info on Mutual Funds,I thought that this was a very thorough book on mutual funds. Bogle brings to light many things that I wouldn't have known. The only problem is it requires good concentration to get through parts of this book as it can be a bit dry at times. Very good source of information overall. I would recommend it for someone to have as a reference.
2,A Cry in the Night,"I love all of Mary Higgins Clark books but this is probably my least favorite. Although it is very suspenseful, I thought it seemed evil and sick. I first I had no idea who it was but when I finally found out I was horrified! Still, you should read it. Don't miss any of Mary Higgins Clark's books!"
5,"Suspense, precaution, and mystery","I just finished reading A Stranger is Watching and I loved it. If you are looking for a book with supsense then read A Stranger Is Watching. First Neil and Sharon Martin are kidnapped by the vicious criminal kidnapper known as Foxy. He traps them and sets a bomb, and it is only a matter of time before they are able to escape. Time.... If you are in the mood for a good mystery book that will leave you wondering the entire time then Read A Stranger Is Watching. I loved it and I'm sure you will to.Read it today!"
5,Great service!,This seller provided fast service and the best price on the video I wanted. The product was in even better condition that I had expected.
2,planet earth,"isn't the series ""planet earth"" also by David Attenborough a remake of this?...They both study life by habitat...only planet earth is much more up to date and visually stunning...By the way I think the best David Attenborough series is Trials of Life (studies animals by behavior)"
1,The Living Planet,"I took college class that required to watch video, Living Planet. My very very disapointment with it. It says cc (closed captioning) which stands for deaf viewers. I watched those DVD and guess what? Those DVD(s) do not display any closed captioning. I am deaf. It angers me very much. I feel like being betrayed by its said feature on the box."
2,"OK, BUT NOTHING NEW","David Attenborough is an extraordinary naturalist. Nonetheless, this series is lacking, not because of the content or Attenborough's presentation, but because it is so old. The DVD's are new, but the series is from the 1980's and therefore outdated. If that is OK with you, then go for it. Otherwise, I suggest you consider the ""Life Series"" by the BBC, Attenborough, and company from the Amazon UK site (Region 2 DVD's)."
4,An old classic that was far beyond its time,"This collection of The Living Planet series appears to be one of the first of David Attenborough and is a ""gateway"" of sorts to the many wonderful life of series from the BBC. The transfer could use some cleaning up, but that seems to be my only complaint. The series is interesting, enlightening, and thoroughly informative. At times David Attenborough is discussing issues that are now being addressed by Al Gore in An Inconvenient Truth. Keep in mind, this series is at least 22 years old. I feel anyone who loves David Attenborough and the other series he is involved with (Recommend The Blue Planet, Life of Mammals, Life of Birds, and Life in the Undergrowth) will love this classic too. A must have for fans."
2,taboo,"I started this book (a gift), threw it across the room after fifty pages, read another chapter, grew more irritated, and took my thoughts out to dinner with two friends who also are sisters. We all agreed the hard limit for sisters is no poaching under any circumstances. If you are so competitive or self-centered or dumb that you cross the line, don't expect to be forgiven. Readers who share that point of view shouldn't bother with this book. The story the author tells won't change your mind."
2,I Disagree.....,"It has taken me a month to read this book and I'm still not quite done. I thought I'd love this book because it is Chick Lit and I love Marian Keyes and the like, but this book is very dull. The story of the three sisters was okay, but that's just it....no snappy, witty dialogue; just an average book that has been done before. I will finish it because I finish almost everything I start unless it is really dreadful, but I can't wait to get onto something else."
3,Solid Chick Lit from Down Under,"Nothing unusual here: It's a typical tale of three sisters -- one pretty and elegant, one cute and young, and the third stuck in the middle. It's got it all -- a stolen fiance, philandering spouses, torrid love affairs, an early death, and a meddling but loveable granny. This book won't change your life, but it's sweet and gentle, and it is the perfect accompaniment for a long plane ride (perhaps to Sydney?) or a beach weekend."
2,A long trip to nowhere very interesting,"I'm fascinated by the role that ""three sisters"" plays throughout folklore and literature (Beauty and the Beast, Cinderella), largely because I myself am the oldest of three daughters. In many ways, the author does capture the particular dynamics of that family model with her three stars: Anna, Bett and Carrie. If the book had been half the length (the story meanders and repeats information endlessly) and had ended with the *real* climax, it might have been a pleasant read. As it was, I became less and less interested and finally bored."
2,The most manipulative grandmother ever?,I've enjoyed all McInerney's novels to date except this one. Spending time with the annoying Lola and her spineless granddaughters was tortuous. Her family matters were much better written about in At Home with the Templetons and all of her other women characters to date have been interesting and believable. Sad to see that her next book is Lola's Secret - enough with Lola already!
2,A disappointment,"Although slow to begin with, this was easy enough to read, but did fall into that category of ""a bit of a waste of reading time"", unless you had a particular reason for reading it. The basic idea (the story of three sisters from a small town in South Australia who all end up back in that town together as adults after years of avoiding one another, and rediscover that closeness) and the setting appealed, but the story itself is very simplistic to the point that it makes you cringe at times. And the book is not particularly ""true to label"" - in an attempt to pack a punch and give the exploration of the sisters' relationships a real focus, it adds a storyline which takes the book into very different territory and which seems at odds with its brief and promise. Presumably this is intended to either shock you or engage your emotions - but for me, it just came across as a cheap trick."
2,Not better than OK,"Not deep enough to work through, and not ""grabbing"" enough to keep you reading. Then, finally, as the book is wrapping up, a ""twist"" that just doesn't bring anything to the book. The author has much potential, the characters were wonderful, but next time hopefully a better end product."
2,Didn't do it for me,"I love chick lit but this book just didn't do it for me. I didn't like any of the sisters and struggled to relate to them. They did some horrible things to each other - I can understand why they weren't talking! I understand its a book about forgiveness and the strength of the family bond but I didn't buy into the making up. This isn't a light, fluffy read. I struggled to finish it. If you are after something a bit more serious and thought provoking then you might like it more than I did."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME AND & MONEY W/THIS!!!!!,"I bought this CD because of all the great reviews. Unfortunatly this thing turned out to be useless and was surprised how amateur this thing is. Besides the fact of poor recording and static noises poping here and there while you're trying to 'tune out' the steps and suggestions to help you deepen your state are laughable and become quite annoying.Guided meditation just like hypnosis differs from meditation by having someone gradually guide you through the process. There's nothing gradual here or anything close of resemblance of a ""guided"" meditation.I think you have to be on some serious drugs in order to find this even slightly effective."
2,Meditations by a Valley Girl,The narrator's voice was so sing-song I thought I was listening to a Valley Girl. If it wasn't for the music it would have been a no star cd.
1,Don't go there.,"After a minute of listening to her annoyingly immature voice, I deleted the mp3. This might be good if you are four years of age."
2,Poor sound and content,"In the past when I've read extremely mixed reviews on products--as is the case with this cd--I've wondered if positive reviews have been written by people trying to promote the item or if negative reviews have been written by people from the competition. In this case, either the positive reviews come from people trying to promote the item or from people who have extremely low expectations regarding the quality of the item. It's very poorly made, both in terms of content and production quality (and I say that as someone who doesn't tend to nitpick about such things). It gives the impression that someone thought it was a good idea to spontaneously create some meditations and record them with amateur recording equipment. If this woman had used these meditations as rough drafts and honed them until their quality was greatly improved and then used professional equipment to record them, she might have come up with a five star product."
1,Disappointed,"I am good at meditation and I only bought this CD because I wanted to experience what it is like to get into guided meditation, feeling the ""company"" of someone else's voice.I was very disappointed. The author uses endless sentences, very long phrases that, instead of helping, keep the listener waiting for her next words, wondering what she is going to say next or when she is going to finally put a semi-colon or a stop. More than guided meditation this looks like a lecture on how to meditate, a lecture one should have to *listen to* and *think about*. Though her voice and tone are correct, at times, the author seems to be looking for the right word, which rather than helping the listener keeps him wondering what is coming next... and hoping it comes soon.In my opinion, short and repetitive phrases should be used in meditation- most specially with beginners- and that is precisely what the author has failed to provide."
2,Totally Disappointed,"I have numberous meditation CDs and with all the good reviews I was very disappointed in this one. I listened to the first track - centering, and the third track - emotions, and thought both sounded more like a talk on the concept rather than a guided meditation. I found myself fidgeting and getting up during the CD because I did not find it calming, centering or helpful."
1,Keeping Looking!,"In trying to deal with the extreme pain of rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, and fibromyalgia I bought several different audio CD's looking for help. I was very disappointed in this one. I found myself totally distracted throughout by the background noises that keep you from getting to a place of deep relaxation. My first thought was that it was made in someone's kitchen while they were making dinner, or doing the dishes. I also felt the imagery did not flow in a manner that was soothing at all. It is too wordy and you find yourself struggling with it instead of relaxing. I'm sorry to say I actually found this CD to be stressful. I would totally not recommend this one - there are some terrific ones out there. Keep looking!"
4,Calming,"This was the first guided meditation CD I ever bought. It is very relaxing and it is a good buy for someone interested in guided meditations. However, it is only three tracks and it can become a bit redundant after a while. I recommend buying several different guided meditation CDs so as not to get tired of anyone."
2,annoying voice,"I'm so glad I didn't buy this CD. I have a radio subscription and found it on my music service. I find her voice to be extremely annoying. as some other reviewers mention, she pauses in a very irritating manner. She doesn't pause where you should have silence to encourage relaxation or visualization but just in a constant halting manner and you want to scream just talk!"
5,Classic Relaxation CD,"This was the first guided meditation CD I ever tried, and years later it is still the best. Nothing else works as well to calm my mind and lift me out of stress and tension."
1,Great Big Disappointment!!!!!!!!!!!,"What a disappointing waste of money, and for that matter, time also. However I have since bought a book that ,unlike this one, actually gives RESULTS and in the first week! It's by a psychiatrist, Richard Brown, called ""Stop Depression Now"". If you want results -that's the one that works. but That's just my opinion and I'm going by the personal experiences of my clients- which some have been amazing following Browns book because it's simple, effective and to the point."
4,Pepper Mill,"I only have one thing to say about this product, it needs to be taller. If you have big hands like I do, then this mill isn't for you. It does a good job for making different sized ground pepper grains though."
4,Even cuter than the bigger one,"This is just so cute, aren't the mini versions of most things cuter than the bigger one? Like my kids!This works fairly well, grinds very fine or coarse good.. functions pretty good and they're super cute. I didn't give five stars because the knob to adjust the grind on top loosens every now and then-no biggie-just tighten it up again. This doesn't happy often so I'm still very happy with my super cute pepper mill."
4,Great little gadget,"Attractive-looking. Clever design. The handle is very easy to turn. The different options (fine to coarse) for grind are nice. It's hard to get it to stay on ""fine"", since the direction the handle twists pushes the dial towards ""coarse"", but I like coarsely-ground pepper, so I don't mind. The handle looks a little cheaply made, but it isn't a problem (it's pretty durable). Conclusion: this is a good small-size pepper grinder. Included peppercorns are nice, too!"
3,"Pretty, but average","This is the second William Bounds grinder like this I bought. I've had the other, which is almost identical but wooden instead of clear, and it's worked very well for the four or five years I've had it. This one doesn't ""feel"" like quite the same quality, and (oddly) the knob on top works its way loose after a while. I love the coarseness settings and being able to see what type of pepper is in the grinder. It's definitely difficult to fill, but my old one has the same problem -- I set the grinder in a bowl, and use a funnel to carefully fill it."
2,"Fabulous product, but doesn't last long","I bought this in January with a gift certificate I got to a cooking store. I have loved it ever since. I use a lot of black pepper in my cooking and it completely suits my needs as it is very easy to grind a lot of pepper quickly and easily. However, just now, as I was making salsa, the bottom of it cracked, a chunk of plastic fell out and peppercorns fell in my salsa... I had to pick peppercorns & fish a piece of plastic out of my salsa. I am so disappointed. I haven't even owned it a year and it's broken already."
3,Reliable,"We owned this for 10 years and bought this and the Keytop to replace when we dropped in liquid. We found the Keytop to be the better mill because (1) it has a full range of granularity settings, (2) refilling is easy, and (3) refilling doesn't change the granularity setting. Also, grinding with the Keytop seemed to be smoother. But, we can definitely say that the WB-1 is reliable. Though, the ill-fated fall was a blessing in disguise as the old WB-1 was a shadow of the new version---hardly any granularity control and rough grinding. All-in-all, this is a good, not great, pepper mill."
2,loved it until it broke,nice small size and I loved this grinder for 2 years... which was when it broke.Since it's plastic the piece on the bottom just shattered and all the peppercorns came spraying out.
5,Great mill!,This is a great little pepper grinder! The coarseness can adjusted by turning the top ring from fine to coarse and produces a lot of pepper. No complaints so far.
2,Pet peeve.,This product is one that I bought after trying it at a friend's house. My arrived in a condition that you can hardly turn it and it will not switch grinds. I'm very disappointed.
4,"Easy to use, produces high volume",This pepper mill is very easy to use and produces high volume quickly. The only downside (thus 4 stars) is the top assembly is made of plastic and doesn't feel very durable. Time will tell! Very pleased for the time being.
3,Very tiny,This item is okay and it functions. But I was very disappointed in the size. We use a lot of pepper and we have to refill this grinder quite often. I was looking for a much larger version of this one.
2,I do not recommend it...,You have to spin the thing 20 times before you get a decent amount of pepper. Good if you need some exercise for your wrist but not for peppering...
1,Appeared nice online,"My husband moved out of town a few months ago and absolutely loves ground pepper. His pepper mill broke so I found this one online and excited for him to receive it. The tracking information states it was delivered to his front door on 7/27 and I ordered it on 7/24 but he still has not received it as of 7/30. I was disappointed to say the least because it was paid for but I guess we'll give it some time yet ?? I can't give an honest review of the item until he actually receives it but the shipping takes a lot longer than two days. Kathie [ASIN:B00004YK67 William Bounds Key Mill ""WB-1"" Pepper Mill]]"
4,Worked well,"Can't determine if another, non-thermal epoxy would have worked better but, it worked well. That is all I have to say..."
5,Artic Alumina Thermal Adhesive,"Great product. Easy enough to use, quick shipping. I don't know how long it will last in the refer, but if I need it, I still have some left."
5,Good thermal epoxy,"Not an every day product, but if you need a good thermal bond, this works. Easy to use, inexpensive. Mix the two parts, and apply to the thinks you want to bond together. Cures in a few hours. As with any epoxy, a bit messy, don't get on your clothes. This is not heat sink grease. It does not come apart. Once set, the parts stay together."
5,Good stuff,"This thermal epoxy worked well. It is a bit of a pain to mix, but sets quickly. Brought down temps over using a thermal pad."
3,Convoluted Online Instructions,"The product works well enough, but the instructions, which are only available online, almost require a college degree in chemistry for you to understand them."
4,faith promoting,"...history (people) will love it, even those who arent into history will get a kick out of it. especially the youth. all these stories are actual events that happened to youth and children while traveling from Illinois to Utah. it is really cool. these teenagers had an amazing amount of faith to go through what they did."
1,kindle edition not formatted,The kindle edition is not formatted properly and does not include the pictures. Don't buy until they fix this edition - opt for the print version instead.
3,interesting travelog,"This book is indeed a memoir of the author in which he recollects his time in Japan and the Zen masters he has met. It provides some interesting cultural background about the Zen as practiced in Japan in the early 70ies and the challenges Westerners faced when trying to practice there.However, it's not a buddhist book, not a book about Zen as such. So it's not exactly what it promises to be. And the writing is not particularly sharp, I struggled to finish it."
5,contemporary zen masters,braverman has a thorough grasp of his material and presents it in a most interesting way............I strongly recommend this book
1,Do not bother,"Upon reading the premise of this book, i thought ""Wow! I can learn the unique views between 5 zen masters, what an intresting concept.""Then I purchased the book.The premise of this book should read Authur Braverman takes you on a journey of how much of a pretetious, self-righteous tourist he can be. There is little to NOTHING about the ideals of the Zen masters, just alot of pointless info, better suited for a Zen Tourist Handbook, and preaching from an author who i believe is completely missing the point of zen."
5,This'll never hit the top 100 because it's too intelligent!,"This is a very well done, thought provoking film. Hopefully that has scared off the riff raff. It sort of reminded me of ""Red Violin"", kind of quirky, but oddly very pleasing and satisfying."
2,Good movie but not enough substance,I felt it lacked actual scenes that were of people of the pastIt had only one scene with people of the pastI bought it hoping to have several past stories.mostly about the company trying to buy the bldgas usuall I had not seen itanother one of my mistakes of the dayMust only buy movies I have seenwould not watch it againchfancier
3,"Well crafted, but well what's the big deal?","This book was ok. The main character has a surprising twist, but there are enough hints you'll figure it out long before it's 'official' in the book. The twist at the end with the Itiri is completely unexpected. The ending is open. It's not a bad book, but if you're looking for a lot of action move on, this isn't an exciting book."
5,Great Album,I din't expect to enjoy this album as much as i ended up enjoying it. Its a truly amazing piece of work and you sould defininitly purchase it!
1,my ears are bleeding,for starters i think that fallon should have stuck to playing music that involves acutal insturments. i must add that any one can buy a computer program such as frootloops and create this monotoned dribble. this is not worth your time. don't bother listening... you will on'y be dissapointed by this atrocity.
1,Im so embarassed,Iam so embarassed i actually bought this and i use the words loosly album this is the worst thing i have ever heard .From Fallons droning vocals to to the unimaginitive lyrics this ahem music that sounds like it was put together by my 3 year old is an attempt by Fallon to get back in the music business.WELL Dear you failed again. I was a fan of hers in her previous band and thought she may have been the talent behind the band BUT no more after hearing this pathetic cry for acknowledgement by the industry FALLON try another career path hairdressing or makup artist or maybe even a waitress .Hang you head in shame that you even released this muddle of crud.On another note i like the cover
1,I WANT MY MONEY BACK,WHAT A WASTE OF MY MONEY THAT WAS SPENT ON THIS JUVINILE PRODUCTION OF SAMPLES AND MONOTONE VOCALS NO WONDER SHE COULD NOT FIND A COMPANY TO SIGN HER PLEASE FALLON KEEP THIS MUSIC TO YOURSELF AND THE ALBUM REVIEW I SUGGEST U BUY IT THOUGH SHE NEEDS THE BUCKS SO SHE CAN MAKE HER KIA PAYMENTS
4,A phenomenon of all puzzle games!,"Pit Droids is the bomb of great puzzle games! I specifically like the great graphics, the challenge of the puzzles, and the hilarious slapstick ""reward"" cutscenes! This is quite another masterpiece created by the brilliant people at Lucasarts' edutainment side, Lucas Learning. Well, sure, some parts are frustrating, like the puzzles that seem to have no solution, and the grunting of Watto and his ""hoarse"" voice. But on the good side ( which is probably 99% more than the bad side) this entertaining game will make you think, "" I didn't waste a penny on this thing!"""
1,This is not good,"YO people, dont waste money on this. Trust me! It is boring. i mean, it takes forever to just beat one!"
4,Excellent choice for the cement process engineer!,"This book provides a broad range of equations, calculations, data, and information useful to the cement process engineer.Everything from plant chemistry, burning, grinding, engineering formulas, and environmental aspects are provided.Everything you need to from performing a routine check to a detailed investigation is included in this book.A must have for the cement process engineer!"
5,Lotta Great Music For Not Much Dough,"3 CDs? With most of the music from the GPs albums and EPs from the 80s and 90s? At this price? I'd call this a can't-miss purchase for those who don't have these songs already-- it all still sounds great decades later, and most of this is difficult if not impossible to find elsewhere. The later material doesn't soar like the first three albums, but it's still raw and fresh and loud and powerful."
3,I can't believe this is out of print!,"Out of nostalgia, I am going through amazon.com, searching for books that particularly stood out from my middle school years...this book was one of them (along with Alfred G. Graebner Memorial High School Handbook of Rules and Regulations, also by Conford, and also out of print - tragedy!). Ellen Conford had such a way of identifying with her readers.In this book, the protagonist finds a lamp, which of course, when she rubs it, produces a genie that grants her every desire. Or so she thinks. For example, when she wishes for the ""perfect man,"" a guy suddenly pops up in her bedroom, bearing flowers in hand.So saddened am I by the gradual disappearance of my childhood books such as this that I am going to try to track them all down and buy them for my future children. Other ""classics"" that are out of print (grrr) are This Time of Darkness by H.M. Hoover and the entire Trixie Belden series. Sniff sniff."
4,good chill roots reggae,"It's good chill roots reggae music. Nothing amazing (although Blood Money is definitely 5-star), but a real solid album overall"
1,10 in 1 The Pleasures of cooking,It's a little hard to review an item that didn't actually come from the supplier when it was suppose to have and you can't get any information from the supplier nor anyone else
2,It leaks...,"Goldenrod Super Squirt Plastic Pistol Pump Oiler, 6 oz. with 4"" straight spoutI've had one of these inexpensive oilers for many years. It works, but far too often, oil winds up on the outside of the yellow container. Whenever it's used, I instinctively grab a paper towel to wipe the thing off afterwards. That's because a small amount of oil leaks out of the mechanism and runs down the side of the yellow container; which is annoying."
3,Slow and trite,"I was quite disappointed with this book; I was expecting so much more from all the 5 star reviews it received. It was a slow read and the plot was pretty predictable. I was close to giving up halfway through reading it - it did pick up a little in the second half of the book though. The main character, Perdita, was rather boring and slightly annoying to be honest. I couldn't have cared less about what she was thinking, as she only thought the same things over and over: 'Perry is a good person but not exciting but I still love, the dear, but I'm still in love with Andrew.'I did enjoy the side story with Caitlin, Kira, and Breton but some of it seemed pulled out of nowhere (not enough exposition I guess).I will agree that the writing was poetic/lyrical but sometimes i ended up just skipping parts because it wasn't moving the story along. The best part of this novel was the length of it; if it was much longer I definitely would have given up. Not a rewarding read."
2,Not for me,"This was not my type of book. I thought the story itself was original and interesting. My problem with this book was that over 1/2 of this book is literary fluff. The author would go on and on for paragraphs about the landscape. Too much poetry for me and I know that it has the word ""poet"" in the title so what should I expect. I expected a little more about the story and a little less about how pretty Scotland is.However, if you enjoyed ""Outlander"", which I did not. I think you would like this book. Very similar IMHO."
4,bittersweet,"I enjoyed this book, but it's not one I would read several times. As a person who loves sad songs (like Operator by Jim Croce, etc), this book fit into that style for me. Love stories and other romances take me away to another place, because many times they are not true to life. As I read this book, I was sad and torn and happy...I realized that the whole situation is TOTALLY something real...real love, real disappointment.That is what sets this book apart from other love stories. Did it end the way had anticipated? Perhaps not. Did it end realisticly? It certainly did, and I have to admire that very much!"
2,highbrow romance,"If one likes Harlequin Romances with a literary flair (if that is not contradictory), this book will probably be satisfactory. The author creates purple prose and self-sacrificing lovers in the haunting setting of Loch Ness, complete with a monster that apparently only the true romanticists can discover. Unlikely situations, characters, and conversation abound, but there may be enough suspense to keep a reader going for the melodramatic conclusion."
4,Looks good,"This piece looks really nice on my VTX 1800C- it dresses up the plain drive shaft nicely. The quality of the piece seems quite good and attaches to the bike satisfactorily (but see below).Somewhat related to this piece is how it pairs up with the matching drive hub cover (Kuryakyn 8688). I wish these two pieces were connected together in some way. I understand fitting after-market pieces are challenging for manufacturers, but I do not see double-sided tape as a long-term solution."
2,"MFG in China, Hit or miss item quality wise.","Decided to try and cheap out and get these for a 2002 passat gls wagon with a blown out CV boot. EMPI has now moved the production of these axles to China and I am a bit skeptical about the quality. They are also a SOLID axle opposed to the hollow OEM ones. I have head stories of people with new ones that are not balanced and vibrations get worse after installation. For me, I would call these a hit or miss item. You may get one that works fine, you may have to go through 5 just to get one that is ok. Also noted, the boot material felt stiffer and cheaper than the OEM one."
3,Label Maker,The instructions on operating this program were not as detailed as they need to be. Otherwise it's ok.
3,"Well-made and durable, but not the fit for me","These socks are constructed well and have held up to multiple machine washings, but I personally don't like the bulk. I bought them when training for a half marathon. They make my feet feel a bit crowded in my shoes, so I now wear them for casual walking only. The sweat wicking does work so my feet don't get hot."
5,Socks,Purchased as a Christmas gift for a member of my family to exchange during our family gift exchange. We use Elfster.
3,Not for me,Good quality sock but it's bulky in the toe and slips during runs. Just doesn't work for my narrow foot.
5,Super Socks,"The padding in these lite socks works wonderfully for walking. I was concerned it might be a bit to thin,but not so!The heel padding extends well above the level of the top of the heel of my golf shoes. No more blisters when walking 18 holes."
2,could be better,"This book provides an ok introduction to Plone, but it couldn't answer a lot of my questions when I was trying to use it to learn how to program in Plone. It is NOT a definitive guide, more of a tutorial explaining how to do a number of different, specific tasks. My opinion of this book is probably also influenced by my negative opinion of Plone itself. There are far less convoluted content-management systems available."
4,"Great book, but also shows why Plone advocates fail at marketing","I did enjoy this book, but it sums up the Geek Overload route most bare-metal Python coders take in promoting Plone as a CMS.The book is 568 pages long, but after page 144 it pretty much turns into a Python coding book with a few bones tossed out as to how to annotate your HTML to point at all the Python scripts you're supposed to write for new products, archetypes, etc.I had hoped for a thick TAL section with explanations on how to customize existing portlets and templates to summarize News items with different display attributes, but again, yet another Python programming book fills up the manual.Please, someone could make LOTS of cash writing a Plone applications book without all the bare-metal Python injections. Where is *that* book?"
3,Good gentle introduction,"Well written introduction for those who like gentle approach. Of course what's gentle for one person is harsh for another. Three months ago I didn't know anything about python, zope and plone. I found the book too thick for the amount of information it contained, especially because it was aimed mostly at people working directly with the web interface to zope and plone. When writing my new plone product - a tool in python - I soon ran out of knowledge based on the book. For me a lot more of serious python examples of Plone API would work better. So if you are an experienced programmer, with knowledge in dynamic languages (Lisp) and want to learn about this interesting new web technology you are probably better off looking for online resources on plone.org and zope.org than buying this book."
3,Finally a book on Plone,"I just recently started working with Plone and found the documentation online of relatively poor quality. So I was quite happy to see a book was released on Plone recently. Overall the book covers all of the major topics quite well and offers quite a few good examples and explanations. However, I have had some difficulty implementing some of these examples, particularly with the use of Archetypes. The explanations are often ambiguous and somewhat leave one wanting more description on how exactly to implement them. Also, I feel that the book is more of a ""read from one end to the other"" type of book, rather than one for use as a reference. The book is more of a cursory walk through Plone, rather than a ""Definitive Guide."" Plone is such a massive subject in itself, it probably deserves to have more than one book written on it. Hopefully this is just the beginning to have more authors right on this product that has such a great potential."
3,Too thorough for beginners,"If you're a beginner to CMSs and have decided to use Plone, I recommend Julie C. Meloni's book instead of this one.Andy McKay obviously knows a lot about his subject, and he takes pains to give a good background and context to the things he does, but to be honest, I chose Plone because I didn't want to know the background. I just wanted to get my site up and running.I'm finding this book very heavy going, although I have no doubt it will be useful in the long term."
5,perm pens,These pens are great for check writing as they cannot be washed off like regular ink pens. I cannot find them locally so AMAZON delivers them fast.
1,Not the quality you would expect from Xerox,"I also regret buying one of these machines. I intentionally chose a Xerox because I thought the name meant reliability. I don't think that anymore. Despite very light use as a home copier, this machine has presented problem after problem. Paper feeding has always been sporadic. Then after two years, the plastic gear on the fuser broke. Fortunately the machine was repaired under warranty. Now however it has broken again: it won't feed paper at all from the main tray.I went through all the diagnostic and repair steps on Xerox's Web site. When the problem persisted I contacted online support. The response? -- to simply cut and paste the same instructions. A call to telephone support was equally unhelpful, resulting only in an offer to schedule a service call for $250 minimum -- half the price of the copier. I'm more inclined to spend the money on a new one, of a different brand."
2,Sorry I made this purchase,"Add my name to the list of those completely frustrated with this machine. The top paper feeder has become completely useless. CONSTANT paper jams no matter what type of paper I use (even the most expensive Xerox paper jams in the top feeder).I thought that by buying a Xerox, I would be getting a good piece of equipment. Not the case. I'm ready to trash this thing and buy a Hewlett Packard copier."
1,this is nonsense..,get the original by george kranz.. this remake is useless.. he turns into into a campy piece of trash!
2,not as good as original,george krantz should not allow anyone 2 redo this song iwas 19 when they were playing this in the gay clubz of new jersey istill have my 12' copy on vinyl tho it iz worn out it iz a great song some one should put this song on a cd with its rainin men so many men so little time and i want 2 break free that would b a realy good cd
5,Fab Stylish Ankle Bootie,These are very stylish ankle booties that can be worn casually with jeans or dressed up with trousers or skirts. I love them!! Comfortable and trendy!!! They arrived promptly and efficiently. Recommend you get a half size larger than you normally purchase.
3,Kinda grandma-ish,"I was bummed when I got these b/c they did not even come close to matching my gray commando tights. I didn't really care for the little stud decorations on the side. It kind of reminded me of aerosoles or naturalizer trying to make the shoes more stylish in a missed attempt. I think they would be more chic with no studs. I can tell they would be quite comfortable if they had actually fit. I have a significant level of frustration with Aquatalia b/c I desperately want a pair of these boots, but according to all the reviews online, most of the styles you need to purchase a 1/2 size up from your normal size. I am a size 10 and they stop making 1/2 sizes after that. :-( So all the 10's are too small and all the 11's are too big where even inserts do not solve the problem. I'm sure these shoes are great for someone but they missed the mark for me in color and size and just overall grandma-ish appearance."
4,A touching (and frustrating) search for a young girl's past.,"I did not realize this book was part of a series or I would have read Too Deep for Tears first. However, this book does well as a stand alone, also. Normally I don't like stories that switch back and forth from past to present, but this book was superbly written in such a way that it was still easy to follow. I thought it was a touching story about family and the traits that are passed down from generation to generation. I especially enjoyed the sections that were written about Eva's ancestors and their lives, joys, and pains."
3,Acne in Black Women,I thought this book would give more details on skin differences among different races. I didn't see much information on specifically black skin. There were few lines on black skin. The information on what type of medicines that could be used on colored skin was helpful. He was also helpful in describing some techniques and medications that are used by dermatologists.
2,"Boring, Boring","I read George's Dark Reunion and liked it enough to think I wanted to read another. Don't bother. Phyllis Reynolds takes her traumatized 8 year old daughter, Celia, to the Lakeside clinic for treatment. She, nor I, knew what she was getting into. The Doctors put scary thoughts into her head, there are creepy noises which they made her listen to and terrifying things came to life at her command. Celia's daddy has just gotten out of prison for abusing her and is on his way to get them. PHyllis has a relationship with Paul Welch and also with Dr. John at the clinic. If this is disconnected, that is what the book is. I doubt I will read another George unless it is given to me, free and clear and I have nothing else to read. Sorry, George."
2,Used to be great,"I used to swear by (never at) this product when it was version 1, on Windows 95. I happily paid the registration fee.But all sorts of nasty things (filesystem crashes, lockups) happened after I upgraded to V4 so I could run it on Windows 2000. The then-owners (Ontrack I think) admitted there were issues, but other than suggesting reinstallation (which didn't work) they had nothing. It was a shocker. I couldn't find anything mentioning this on the web, and now the product seems to have faded into obscurity. Maybe it's ok under SP4, I don't know, I can't afford to risk it. Shame."
4,Very good,"Zipmagic difently gives winzip a run for its money! You can view zipped files with ease without decompressing them and extract just one or many files and not the whole archive. It does do a great job of compressing, better than many others, but if you want to really compress your files you have to use winaceWinace can support ALL compression types including their own .ace which is more than half the size of any zip archive.It has any feature that you could ever want in a compression program.You can also create self-extracting files. I use it to create self extracting files that i e-mail and they are SO MUCH SMALLER than the zip or any compression type making all those people with 56k connections a lot happier!!..."
2,Mine cracked in less than 2 years,"I bought this William Bounds salt mill from Macy's for $20 and it lasted less than two years. The body is made of transparent plastic and the metal grinder is attached at the bottom of the plastic with some kind of rivets. This is, I think, the weak point where cracks appear, and then one day, the bottom just literally falls out. Hopefully, we haven't been getting ground up plastic parts in our food!"
5,Will Buy Another,"I too use it for my Himalayan sea salt. You have to use coarse grind salt. I used to get the chunks out too, until I put on my glasses one day and saw how to get the mill to do the fine grind. This is my bad, not the mill's. I have had mine for 4 or 5 years and am very pleased. Will get another so I can use it with Salish smoked salt. This is a great way to add smoked flavor to soups and such without using smoked meats."
2,"uneven grind, jerking motion when cranking handle","I bought some Himalayan Pink salt which looks nice in the clear acrylic. But even on the fine setting, it lets larger chunks through and isn't as fine as I like. The handle jumps forward in a jerky motion, getting more salt on food than you wanted. You have to crank the handle in the direction of the fine grind on the dial, if you don't the dial sometimes skips to the medium setting. The nut on the top loosens frequently. You'd be better off buying a traditional mill in the acrylic."
3,Great crushing mill at this price point,"For the most part what other reviewers have said of this mill is true. Yes the nut loosens over usage, if you grind it counterclockwise it'll skip to medium, and it leaks salt as most mills do (that's what salt and pepper holders are for).However, even with those faults it's a damn fine grinder at this price point as it actually crushes (not grinds) the salt crystals which makes sea salt flaky and taste like something magical."
4,Easy to use,"Easy to use, and to choose various grinds (large to fine). Lost one star because it hold too little. We have one for our favorite sea salt and another for a wonderful sea salt and dried chunk garlic mix...yum!"
1,Junk,The image is misleading. Plastic bottle with a flexible spout that will hardly flex and won't stay in a bent position. Too much trouble to return.
3,Musique,"I listened to a small sample of this album online as most do and thought I might like to hear more. After some minor issues including receiving an empty cd case which Amazon quickly fixed I finally got to listen to the album. I did not know Miles Corbin from a bunch of bananas. The music is gentle, smooth and very very relaxing. If you are anything like me you will use music to help you through the day. This album is fantastic to help you just chill out. If you have had a pretty tough day then give this a listen. Try mixing it with a nice cool drink of your favourite beverage and you can't go too far wrong."
1,The Kama Sutra of Vatsayayana,The beautiful book pictured is false advertising. I own this book and the writing is not the correct writing that is withing this book cover!!!Buyer Beware!!!!
5,Excellent introduction to AI,"What a great book! I was quite familiar with Common Lisp prior to reading this book (from Paul Graham's ""ANSI Common Lisp"", but without any AI experience really. This book was definitely a treat. He thoroughly covers large projects (Elizza for example) in a clear manner. His handling of classic AI algorithms is very entertaining and educating! I recommend this book to anyone who's serious about learning AI with Common Lisp. Make sure you already know Common Lisp though."
2,"Writing is good, but difficult to use","I used this book during a three day visit I made to Vienna. I only used the book in Vienna and therefore, I can not critique the book for the rest of Austria. However, based on the coverage of Vienna, I would have a difficult time recommending this book. The main flaw with the guide is the index which is inadequate. For example, if you want to find the opening hours of one of the museums in Vienna, you have the skim through the entire Vienna section of the book in hopes that the name of the museum will jump out at you because the museum will most likely not be in the index. This in itself is terribly frustrating.This is the only book that I used, so I can not say if one of the other guide books would be a better option. Just be aware that the Rough Guide Austria has its flaws."
4,Origional and Creative,"Being a DJ myself, it's rare that I bother purchasing a mixed compilation... However, unlike most of the CDs that exist in the vast ocean of DJ mixed compilations, this one has some originality and creativity to it that make it stand out. The tracks are rare, the mixing is exceptional, and the production is above average. I'd recommend it. Good mood music to put on at a cocktail lounge or at an intimate social gathering."
3,resourceful,"If you are having behavior issues with your Aspie, this book helps you understand a bit more. I bought it for the teachers in my sons school who just refuse to believe that aspergers has anything to do with his issues. I found it very resourceful."
2,Not as practical as indicated.,"While the book did cover many different issues we personally dealt with, it did not offer any real advice to deal with them. It seemed to discuss the rages and some of the possible reasons they happened, but gave me no tangible advice how to get rid of them. To be fair, we had already tried quite a few different approaches, so maybe that is why thebook seemed to offer no new ideas for us. I was looking for specific ways to de-rage my son, as well as ways to help him learn to self-regulate his outbursts.I understand that some people have found great value in this book, however I did not."
2,There are lots of better options out there,"I continue to find problems with this book and the recommendations contained in it. I'm a psychologist who has been working with people on the spectrum for years. I get called often because of aggression issues and have been addressing issues related to aggression as a psychologist and behavior analyst for decades. There are lots of better options out there than this book that more accurately reflect the level and nature of the research available on tantrums, aggression, and behavior problems and how to deal with them. While I realize that these issues are very hard to deal with and lots of people, particularly parents trying to figure out what is going on, need help this book presents some fairly basic material that is solid and misses in lots of other ideas that actually make things worse. Try Attwood's books first."
5,"Asperger Syndrome and Difficult Moments Practical Solutions for Tantrums, Rage, and Meltdowns","It is an excellent read, It is an easy read and very clear presentation of the Rage Cycle. Really helps understand Asperger Syndrome."
2,Not worth the price,"I read the first 30 or so pages of this book shaking my head and saying ""Yes! Yes! This is my child- now tell me what to do about it!"" I never got to that. The majority of the book is sample forms to be used by teachers in a school setting along with advice to those teachers. The last part- the very shortest part- is for the parents and it, quite frankly, isn't really much help. I wouldn't recomend this book unless you are buying it for your child's teacher. Then it could be worth while."
2,I returned this book to Amazon,"I began to read it and didn't like it at all. I skimmed through the rest of it and found it a terrible bore, badly written, and not particularly helpful. I agreed with another reviewer, who stated that implementing the strategies outlined in the book would actually make a bad situation even worse. We decided to go with the Collaborative Problem-Solving Approach outlined in The Explosive Child by Dr. Greene, and so far we have been very pleased with the results, especially in the home environment."
3,"A good book, but not what I expected from the title","When I read the title of this book I bought it immediately as I am struggling with my daughter's meltdowns and it seemed it might offer the answers I need. Unfortunately, I found little in here that I can use. There were some good parts that I can give to my family and friends to help them understand Asperger Syndrome a lot better though. If your child is school aged - and probably in high school - then you might find the information more helpful. It has great tips about identifying and tracking triggers, but I already do this and do it quite well. What I wanted were some strategies to stop the meltdowns when you can't remove or forget about the triggers and I don't think the book gave me enough of these."
2,A horrible interpretation,"Do not buy this CD. It takes a magnificent piece and butchers it. The orchestra was sloppy, the piece dragged, and it was just not worth even the five dollars it cost. If you had never heard the Carmina Burana, it would ruin your first time."
1,Check System Requirements BEFORE buying!!,"We have a six month old HP computer system. Imagine our surprise, when on Christmas day, we loaded the Narnia game only to be told that it required ""Pixel Shader"" in order to operate. Sure enough, this requirement is listed in small print on the bottom of the box, but we sure didn't notice the bottom of the box BEFORE we opened it. Check your system to make sure you can meet the minimum requirments!Requirements of this type should largely advertised both on the front of the box, and on the advertisements/descriptions so that there is no ugly and potentially costly surprise."
1,Don't ruin your child's Christmas....check your graphics card,"After major disappointment with the Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire game, our son was really looking forward to this game based on the first 2 reviews. Unfortunately, we have no idea if he would like it. After installing it on our almost new computer, we received an error: ""Fatal Error! Sorry, but your machine is unable to run this game. We require a graphics card which can support vertex and pixel shader v1.1. The game will now exit."" What a deal--we have to upgrade our video card in order to run this game! Since these requirements are not standard on new high-end computers, it would have been very nice of Buena Vista Games to highlight this requirements. I can imagine the tears, tantrums and frustrations throughout the US on Christmas morning. What a shame. What a rip-off. They must be in cahoots with the graphics card manufacturers.This has now received a T/Teen rating."
2,buy this if you're mad at your money,Our kids were very excited to receive this game on Christmas only to be disappointed that it needed a special video card. We had to spend over $100 to make this game work. The extra money is not worth owning the game.
2,too hard to move around,"I find the graphics and the game to both be excellent and enjoyable. The problem I have is with movement. I wish they would've made the game a one player game and incorporate the mouse into the movement better. It is just far too hard to move around and do things.Normally PC is my way to go for games; I prefer PC over all other formats. But this time around, I've got to recommend that you go for either the Xbox, PS2 or Gamecube versions instead."
3,So Tiny!,"I didn't want to give this 2 star because I didn't read the dimensions. This book is really, really small. Approx 5x3 inches and only a few sheets of stickers. My fault, but I wish I had gotten a coloring book instead."
5,Keeps on Grinding,"After a year of heavy use, this grinder is still going strong on the same batteries. I gave this to my daughter last year who is an avid cook and she just loves it. I'm buying 4 more for other friends ANd one for myself. No complaints whatever."
3,just ok,"This is my first pepper grinder that is not a disposable,I think it does an ok job of grinding but does not really have the ""feel"" that I would like. It feels a little weak as you grind but it does get the job done."
3,A good start,I liked this book but like the other reviewers have said it's not exactly heavy on programming. Still I thought it was a good companion to John Rothon's book Programmer's Guide to Internet Mail.
3,Should have been titled Explaining Internet EMail,The previous reviewer hit it right on the head. This book is very light on programming. Don't expect to build an email client by copying and modifying examples out of the book. But it does a good job on explaining the various mail protocols. I appreciated it on that level because books on internet protocols are rare.
1,What is he thinking?,I admit that I read every word...mainly because I was waiting for something redeeming to happen. It never did. Reading other readers comments helps me understand why the genre of American authors is so dismal. They have an audience.
2,Smallest Book Ever- Buyer Be Advised!!,"This is the smallest book I have ever seen. 465 small pages with tiny font. The book is so small it is uncomfortable to hold. I'm not enthused about reading this book. For me this is a waste of money. I want to read the book, but will likely need to re-purchase from a book store. Lesson learned. Going forward I will pay attention to the product dimensions before purchasing online again."
5,Realistic-Amazing novel,"I am home for summer vacation, and wanted to start reading some of the books that I had accumulated over the course of the year. After reading the reviews for She's Come Undone, I decided to start on it. The book drew me in from the very beginning. The main character, Delores, battles some of life's most difficult themes, and always kept me guessing at what was going to happen next. It is true that the book can be depressing at times, but it is depressing because you are drawn into her life, and feel as if you are going through everything that she is going through. Wally Lamb created exceptionally realistic characters that you loved and hated with a variety of other emotions mixed in. This book proved to be an outstanding novel, which makes your heart go out to the characters while providing thought provoking questions for your own life as well."
4,The Ultimate Womens Book Written By A Man,"I absolutely loved this book. It is not only an amazing book, but amazing that a man was able to transform himself into a young woman. A young woman who has issues that are often difficult for a man to understand. It was so well written and filled with emotion that I honestly would like to congratulate Wally Lamb. He is a true author when he can transform himself into a whole different sex with whole different issues, and still have the book become a masterpiece. It became so real that I felt her sorrow and pain through out the story. Its one of the books you can't put down once you pick it up. The only thing I would change with the book is there was a lot of going back and forth from the past to present and it was sometimes confusing for me. Other then that it was an excellent book."
4,Wally Lamb is a humanist.,I am somewhat taken aback by the the many reviewers who can't believe a man could write this book. It seems as if we have forgotten that boys and men have many of the same traumas and life tragedies experienced by Delores. If a man can write about the fantastic of space exploration or imagine the horrors of war without actually having the experience why can't he be insightful about the sex he has studied and tried to understand his whole life. I found this book to be humanistic. Dolores could have just as easily been a boy named Bill
1,I must have missed something...,"This book did nothing for me. I did not bond or identify with Dolores...nor did I like her. She went out of her way to hurt everyone who loved her. Then in the middle of the book, she went through some amazing transformation. She became considerate and insightful. This was probably the worst book I've read in years--thankfully it was an easy read"
2,It was ok but...is the best you can come up with Oprah!,"I purchased this book not knowing that it was an Oprahselection. Gee where was I? I go to work all day!!! Anyway, whenthe check-out person informed me of the book's status, I guess I just expected too much. As a formerly (and still borderline) fat person, I can sympathize with Delores, but let's hope that most people with problems can find more positive ways to solve them."
3,DEPRESSING,"Everything bad that could happen did happen. Only read this if you're the type that has to have a daily pity party. Although this is fiction, it'll help you see that somewhere in the world, there's always someone who has it worse. For the rest of us, you'll just get frustrated with the main character Delores. In my opinion, she was choosing to be unhappy. Bad things happen, but she chose to focus on the negative, remain unhappy, and make everyone else around her miserable instead of accepting the love and support of those around her. Misery really does love company. I don't want to give away the ending, but nothing redeeming takes place. I was really disappointed."
5,Done Perfectly,"Lamb is one of the great storytellers of our time. Not only is he a great writer but there is heartfelt compassion and emotion in his stories. There seems to be a goodness in Lamb, a love of words, character and story that is both humble and great. I am suprised at the reviewers who could not see this and found this book depressing and dark. The story and main character are real life and tenderly crafted without sappy sentimantality. This book is a triumphant story of survival in the face of life's difficulties. I also recommend his other book IKTMIT. It is equally engaging and well told."
4,She's Come Undone,This is one of those book were you can't wait till the next page and the page after that. I was hooked on it untill the very end. I must say I didn't understand the ending very much...but I will surely read it again.
2,Fair,"It could make a great movie with a good editor and if it were directed by Penny Marshall. It needs insightful character development.As a novel, it is written on about a sixth grade level. That is...poor writing --needs depth. I would recommend it to a teenager or someone whose literary tastes are of the ""comic book"" genre. Not a great book ...but it has possibilities.The subject matter is what is important and relevant. It was written by a man and it shows. No depth"
1,Complete waste of time,"This book came highly recommended from a friend of mine. When I picked up the book at the store, I noticed that it was an Oprah selection. This should have been warning enough to put it back. I managed to finish the book but it was quite a struggle. I found the characters shallow, annoying and I had absolutely no sympathy for Dolores. The only reason why I kept on reading was that my friend insisted that I would come to love the main character.This is a great book to read when travelling - it is simple, uncomplicated, does not require any thinking on the reader's part, and it is in no way difficult to put down should you decide to pursue other activities"
1,HORRID!,"This was, by far, the worst book I have ever read. This book has absolutely no redeeming qualities and does little more than glorify spite and immaturity. The male characters are absolutely horrific - narcissistic adulterers and rapists - while the ""heroine"" is a emotional black hole. The story is full of tired cliches and stereotypes. I sincerely hope that men don't turn to this book for insight into the female psyche. ""She's Come Undone"" is an insult to any intelligent woman. It certainly shouldn't appeal to any discerning man either. I am ashamed I wasted my time reading it. I would have given it 0 stars but that wasn't an option."
1,Zero Stars,I don't agree with the praise given to how this story was written. I found the story hard to stick with. What was most frustrating was that the male characters were very shallow and unbelievable. (Ironic since the female characters had more depth and this is all from a male author.) The only redeeming quality would be the subject matter. I was not impressed with this story. I will be more discriminating next time I try an Oprah recommendation.
3,An entertaining novel.....,"This book was entertaining. I kept reading it just to find out what would become of Dolores. In the first half of the book I found myself being depressed and sad. She was either being a real brat and thinking of herself a lot or being just a sad soul! I understand though how she could turn out that way because I have gone through some of those problems. During her ""depression stage"" I wanted to scream for her to stop feeling sorry for HERSELF and do something ABOUT IT! It got a lot better as the book went on though and as I said earlier....it was an entertaining novel!!! =)"
5,A Must Read Book!,"I picked up this book hoping it would interest me and from the very first page, it enthralled me. I could not put this book down and I absolutely love Dolores and her will to go on through life even if hers hasn't been nice. I truly enjoyed this book and was amazed at how much detail Wally Lamb put in the book from a child to a teenager to a woman's eyes. Go out and get this book. I'm already volunteering my copy out!"
3,A sad story about a young woman's attempt at love.,I only gave this book a three star rating because it was slow-reading. Quite depressing at times with few light moments in the story.
5,How could a male author write the female soul so well?,"I never imagined that any novel, especially one written in the 90's could inspire my emotions ""She's Come Undone."" Yet this beautifully written, popignant, honest novel put me on the brink of epiphany. This is the story of a girl, not very unlike myself, who struggles to live her often disconcerting life, and I think most of us can relate to that. From culturally-induced notions of what her body should look like to a mother afflicted with terrible diseases of the mind, our heroine suffers and learns and survives. And now that you're thinking I'm some new-wave hippie wanna-ba, I'll attempt to avoid saying anything that sounds cheap or insincere. In conclusion, this book could prove life-altering for you, if you can relate to the heroine as much as I did."
5,Great book!,"One of my all time favorite books. I have it in the paperback edition, and have read it several time. Wish it was available in Kindle version too!"
3,"Poor character development, interesting perspective","I enjoyed the first half of the book then kind of lost interest when Dolores ""found"" herself by marrying the wrong guy and lost the bitterness and insight that made her intriguing. The book became less like a journal and more dialogue heavy, which was pretty boring. Everything was also wrapped up a bit too neatly in the end with past characters reappearing. Many of the characters were interesting in the first half but then characters in the 2nd half were muddled. It was interesting from a historical perspective (early 60's to late 80's) and Wally Lamb seems to really understand women/girls but I probably wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
2,Needless suffering,"Sometimes beautiful writing elevates a sad story to universality and dignity. In this book, the writing is like a butterfuly being crushed again and again by a pointlessly depressing mallet of a storyline. The heroine goes through hell, and I still hated her. That should not be! What makes readers want to moil around in the darkness this book creates and stay there for the days and days it takes to read it? If free-floating sadness is your bag, I guess this is the book for you. Otherwise, run."
3,A good book...,...but dissapointing when compared to Lamb's other novel (which I read first) called I Know This Much Is True. This novel was still an interesting story about a troubled and unfortunate girl. It's depressing but still held my attention. Buy it used; I wouldn't spend full price on this one. But I Know This Much Is True should be bought new and read often!
4,Goop for the Soul,"This book will NOT let you put it down. It is voyeurism at its most despicable and honest moments. Lamb writes a most believable and traumatic narrotive. You have to investigate not only the purpose of the book, but discover why it bores into your soul with the tenacity of a beaver on speed.With its terrifying, revolting, and sometimes just downright mean characters, it is not for those with weak stomachs or hearts.To be honest, it was not until after I finished the book that its true worth and value were realized. The end comes as a fresh sea breeze into a stale and decrepit room.If you can get through the perils of Dolores, you too will be a survivor worthy of this book's ultimate reward."
5,One of my all-time favorite books,I read this book a couple of years ago and still think of it often. It is one of my all-time favorites. Dolores was not a very nice person at times and not very likable but still I felt sorry for her because in the beginning of the book we saw her as a child and I liked her then and knew what events caused her to act the way she did as a teen and a young adult. This book is not about a fairy tale where people just get over things instantly. Dolores is far from perfect and struggles to overcome some horrific events that took place in her childhood but that is what makes her real.
3,Gripping--I made a mad dash to finish this book!,"After seeing this title recommended by Oprah's Book Club, I decided I wanted to read it. It looked interesting, but I thought it would be more light-hearted. I enjoyed the book in retrospect, but there were parts of the book which disgusted me. I felt the only way to ""feel OK"" was to continue reading until I could reach some sort of happy sentiment in the book. However, I definitely recommend this book. Dolores, the main character, will stay with you for several days after you have read this novel. Gripping--I made a mad dash to finish this book!"
5,The Power of Oprah,"A very powerful and frank novel. Some parts seem too hellish to ever have happened, but the weight control problem and her responses to the ones around her was just too painful to read. It's quite surprising how one day time talk show can bring fame to a book such as thus."
5,The best book I ever read!,"She's Come Undone is definetly the best book I ever read. I am a 15-year old sophomore in high school, and I read the book twice a year-once over Christmas vacation and once in the summer. It is so movingly written, you would swear the writer was a woman by his profound thoughts and feelings. I would recommend this book to anyone!"
5,Page Turner,"I started and finished this book in 2 weeks. I simply couldn't put it down. The experiences Delores goes thru was so difficult but you couldn't help but think, whats going to happen next? Even though the main story consists of depressing events happening to the main character, Wally Lamb does a GREAT job of inserting the funniest lines that always made me laugh. My boyfriend would lie in bed next to me and wonder why I'm always laughing as I was reading this book. It's a great story for anyone who wants to read about how a girl with the worst childhood survived it all. I definitely give it two thumbs up!"
5,Read this book!,"This was one of my favorite novels of all time! It is well-written, funny, but extremely touching. I recommend it most highly!"
4,facinating life chronicle,"Dolores Price lives the sad life. From her first days as a young child things have not been going well for her. Her younger brother was killed before he was born and her mother never recovered and was sent to an insane assylum. Her parents then divorced when she was 10 and she and her mother moved in with her grandmother. In this new house she was violently raped by her neighbor who she thought was her friend. She spends the next years growning larger and not growing stronger. She has given up all hope that she will ever be someone.Until one fateful day has Dolores face her fears and become a better person than anyone ever thought she could be.Wally Lambs first novel is a literary tour de force, better than all the thrillers. Our thirst to find out what happens from her narrative from when she is four until when she is forty will ahve us cheering for her to do better. She's Come Undone is a terrific novel, one we can hope for many more of."
5,phenomenal book!,"I am an avid reader, and this is just about the best novel I have ever read. Dolores is a complex character, one who I felt a range of emotions toward as I read the book. Wally Lamb does not spare her from terribly difficult experiences that led me to feel sad and sorry for her, nor does he spare her from making foolish mistakes that made me want to say to her, ""Stop! Don't do it!"" Like other reviewers, I was surprised and impressed that a male author had so completely and believably captured the female protagonist. It is very well written--even minor characters like her college roommate are distinctive and memorable, and her emotional growth throughout the book is well chronicled and mesmerizing to read about. I recommend this book very, very highly."
4,"Great read, but tragic characters...","I kept asking myself throughout this book, do I even like Delores? Matter of fact, all the characters are so complex and dysfunctional that I couldn't decide who I liked or didn't. This kept me interested throughout the book because I couldn't wait to see what was gonna happen next or what crazy thing she would do."
3,Glad it was a gift!,I got this book for my birthday. That's the good news. At least I didn't buy it. I enjoyed most of it however I was disappointed with the ending that Mr. Lamb's chose. Perhaps my expectations were too high. I was enthralled with the idea of a man writing in the voice of a woman. I felt failed in several areas. Delores was a good character but she is NOT one that will become a rocking chair memory for me
5,You will never forget her,"On the inside flap of this book it says two things that couldn't be more true. The first is that you will never forget Dolores Price, love her or hate her. The second is that you will have to keep checking the back flap to make sure that it was a man who wrote this story. How can a man be so familiar with things that many women feel everyday but never speak about?Some may say that she did some horrible things, and I'm not saying she didn't. But she is not a perfect person, she is full of flaws like the rest of us. If you want a perfect heroine, read one of those mindless romance novels"
3,Mediocre Coming-of-Age Account,"There are better ""coming-of-age"" books out there: Sheri Reynold's 'Rapture of Canaan"" is one.Lamb's book is a good read; it doesn't demand your intellectual capacity for hidden insights (if there were any at all). Dolores' torments did not shine through for me; in fact Lamb tries too hard to find a lyrical voice! The character of Dolores doesn't mature; I find the protagonist rather detached from her inner self. Not much soul.If you want a book for a lazy afternoon that doesn't require much effort, get this by all means. But it won't be shortlisted for your books of the decade. Try Frank McCourt's 'Angela's Ashes' instead. That IS a masterpiece"
4,Very enjoyable yet sad...,"This book is not just about the trials and tribulations of a fat girl but about growing up, rape, family relationships, marriage and divorce. Dolores Price is a honest, funny, real character and I found myself rooting for her all throughout the novel, even when she made questionable decisions. At times hilarious and heartbreaking, this was the one of the best books I've ever read concerning the above mentioned issues."
1,Distasteful.,"My husband's cousin loaned me this book while the family was on a cruise together celebrating my mother-in-law's 60th birthday. I had already gone through my stack of reading material and looked forward to this book, which I had considered purchasing, but which hadn't made the final cut. Overall I found it distasteful. The characters were unsympathetic. The situations were unrealistic. The only deep feeling this book invoked was disgust. Why be miserable ? Avoid this book."
5,I loved it!!!,This was one of those book's you just can't put down. Doleres is me she's you she's your bestfriend. Every page kept me wanting more. She is beautiful inside and out. I need more like this one.
5,everyone will see themselves some where in this book!,"A heartbreakingly real but mystical book about one girl's life that speaks to all of it's readers about their lives and perspectives. I laughed and cried....everyone who reads this book may not love it but, they will find themselves somewhere in this extra ordinary story. I have never heard of Wally Lamb before, but can't wait to read more!"
3,I found little to admire in Delores Price.,"After reading about 1/3 through, I remarked to someone that I usually don't enjoy a central character who's thoroughly unlikable and unsympathetic. I kept waiting for the payoff but she stubbornly remains true to the initial characterization. Furthermore, Wally Lamb did not give a clear picture of Delores -- what does she look like, and how does she feel (in honesty). And why is she a sexual victim so many times? Why no friends -- well, I guess the answer is, she's unlikable and ultimately uninteresting, as is the book, despite the very good details of setting and place."
3,Mixed feelings about this book,"I really liked the first half of this book and thought it would be one of those stay-up-all-night-to-finish-it reads. I was able to empathize with the young Dolores and her anger at her father and her inability to fit in at school. I could sympathize with the fact of her rape and weight gain. I really felt for Dolores until she went off to college and still refused to grow up. I lost all sympathy for her when she poisoned the fish. After that, the book dragged for me and I had to force myself to finish it."
4,Undoing the past,"She's Come Undone is a novel of disintegration. Dolores's life begins to unravel with the arrival of a free television set, though her life has always been poised to erode.Like all unhappy families, Dorloros's is unhappy in its own, special way, though I admit that I'm getting tired about reading about unhappy families. It seems like this is yet another my-family-sucks-and-that's-why-I'm-so-messed-up book. It seems like people in America blame their parents for everything. Yes, your parents gave you your problems, but they're YOUR problems now. Deal with them and move on.Lately, I've been branching out from the so-called chick lit genre into more diverse books just because, although Tolstoy would disagree, it seems like there are only so many variations on the unhappy family, and I think modern literature has run through them all.TryRabid: A Novel, for a truly original take on the unhappy family and recovery. It's a much better book.Minna"
4,Wow!,"I recently re-read this book for the first time since it came out in 1997 and I remember nearly nothing about it. Vague, general scenes of a woman in distress, but really none of the specifics.I think this book is amazing. Yes, I found myself frustrated throughout nearly the entire story. But isn't that the point? I think a good writer is one who is able to take you through a story and make you feel the feelings of the character.Yes, you wanted to shake Delores and wonder why she continued to hurt herself and the ones she loved and act like a doormat to the ones who hurt her. But I really felt the end was worth it. Get ready for a bumpy ride, folks, because you are gonna be jostled around like a rag doll!"
3,An impressive debut,"This author is a chameleon. You, the reader, are given the opportunity to slip inside the head of this rather tragic, dysfunctional heroine and view life through her eyes. Lamb's got a real knack for easy-to-read prose, and that shines through here as well. My only area of concern is that it seemed entirely too easy for her to lose the weight, but maybe that's just me. I am quite glad I read this one, and odds are you will be too."
4,Superb coming of age fiction.,"What I think is most remarkable about this novel is the fact that it was written by a man. How can a man see so deeply into the heart of a woman? It made me laugh, cry, and discover a few things about myself. What more could you want from a novel? Any woman who was once an overweight girl will find a kindred spirit in Dolores Price. However, I was dismayed at the ""cure"" for Dolores' problems- she lost weight, and suddenly she was ""normal"" again. It disturbs me that Wally Lamb views excess weight as a sign of a mental disturbance. It is time that people learn to accept others and themselves at any size, race, or creed. Despite this glaring offense to fat people everywhere, this is a terrific novel with a lot to offer."
3,Good but depressing,"I really liked the writing and the characters in this book, but things just kept getting worse and worse! I wanted something to finally go well for the main character."
5,"A WONDERFUL, INTERESTING SURVIVAL STORY FOR WOMEN.","SHE'S COME UNDONE, follows the triumphs and downfalls of Dolores Price,who grew up in a very unstable family enviroment. Women can identify with this story because it deals with the many ordeals that all kinds of women encounter in their lives and takes it one step further to the extreme circumstance. Throughout the book the reader finds themselves cheering, and rooting for Dorleres to overcome all of lifes battles that she is forced to face. The auhtor, Wally Lamb is able to appeal to most women by having his lead character suffer and endure tragedy after tradegy. Just like ""I Will Survive,"" the hit song by Gloria Gaynor has become known has the women's anthem, She's Come Undone can be considered the women's bible. Giving readers of all ages a positive message of being able to overcome any obstacles you are forced to complete throughout your life."
4,Wally Lamb reaches deep into the hearts of women everywhere,"As if a divorce wasn't enough for a confused, torn girl, a move and a tragic 'injury' cause her to spend her high school years in front of a TV, overindulging on chips, sweets, and daily shows. When she rolls into her senior year at 275 lbs., her commited mother and nervous grandmother pressure her into college, to start over. The worst for Dolores is only beginning. Wally will truely astonish you with his amazing talent of reading into the hearts of women everywhere. What does Dolores' life slim up to be? Find out in this wave-crashing novel of love, hate, mistakes, and... recoveries?"
2,I've read better,"A friend of mine advised me not to read this book, but I was curious as to what all of the hoopla was about so I picked it up. Unfortunately, I should have listened to my friend's advice. Dolores irritated me. She is a character that you want to try to love, but her actions make that impossible. True, she had a terrible childhood which haunts her throughout her life, but I never really connected with her. The one thing I did find it interesting was the fact that the novel was written by a man. I'm curious as to why Wally Lamb chose to write a story from a woman's point of view, but he writes about an overweight woman at that. I'm surprised Oprah has this book in her club--when is she going to discover The Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood?"
5,COMPELLING,"I loved this book. People of all types can relate to Delores Price. She is given the struggles that a person might get in one life, not alnoe the first forty years of her life. Even thought this is a fictional book, there are people out there like her. This makes you take a good look at yourself and wonder what your moaning about. I've already delt with my parents divorce and being overweight and having to lose it and I'm only fifteen. But by her age she's been raped, delt with a divorce, a siblings death, an insane mother and having to live with an unbearable grandmother and the worst has yet to come. This is a must read book for everyone!"
3,Good,"I enjoyed this book; yet, often after reading for awhile i often felt depressed and in a mad mood. This book describes a very very difunctional girl. The way the author writes about the characters often makes you feel very strongly about each one. In other words, I either hated, pitied, or only mildly liked each character. If you can handle, read it, if not stay away."
5,SUPERIOR!,"It's amazing that a MAN wrote this. It's got the sensitivity and workings of a womans mind, her most inner thought that are seldom expressed to others, even her friends. Superior writing and the story moves along quickly!"
3,"Challenging, unpleasant, but worthwhile","Let me start by saying that this is a well-written book. Lamb knows how to keep the reader's interest, and the description is good. It takes great skill to create such an unlikeable protagonist, yet not turn her into an antihero. (The fish tank sequence made me want to jump into the book and kill her--truly.) After she reformed, however, I was rooting for her more. One thing that bothered me was the perpetuation of the stereotype of overweight people having been victims of sexual abuse. (I feel bad for those who are/were, but I would hate for someone to look at me and assume that.) The passages about the Wellfleet whales were moving. The best plot ""tweak"" in this book was the illustration of what happens when you get what you want! Again, this is basically a very good book--I'm just not usually into ""chick"" books, I guess."
2,Unrealistic melodrama,"How many horrible things can happen to one person? I think that's the question that this novel sets out to answer. Instead of having the heroine deal with one, two, or maybe three, major traumas of her life, every chapter of Dolores Price's life is filled with tragedy, cruelty, and let's face it, felonies! The local police agency should really talk to her, because she can implicate lots of people as she is the victim of at least 3 felonies.The story isn't boring, and I read the whole thing in one night, but about half way through, it was a stubborn determination that drove me. I kept on thinking ""Surely nothing else terrible can happen to this woman"", and I kept on being proven wrong.If you like to read a story of someone who went through hell and made it out alive, you might like to read this book. Because Dante would have placed her journey somewhere between 4th and 5th level of hell. Personally, I found the whole exercise preposterous."
2,Boring and annoying,"The only reason I gave She's Come Undone 2 stars instead of 1 is because I actually read the entire thing (usually I stop anywhere from 20 to 100 pages into a book I don't like), and I also laughed at Roberta's radio show. I can't believe it took that annoying little brat forty-some years to get over herself. She was sarcastic, but she wasn't funny. I enjoy wit, puns, and sarcasm, but Dolores was just annoying. She should have just went under in the middle of the book, and the rest of the story could have been about Roberta -- now there's an interesting character! I understand that people go through many tragedies and don't immediately get over them, but this was just too much for a work of fiction. Her story didn't even come across as that tragic. What's ""tragic"" is that some readers are appalled at some of the ""disturbing"" scenes in the book. I guess all of the Disney movies were rented the day they decided to read the book."
1,No Stars,"I found this book so presumptuous, so insidious and so infuriating that the minute I was finished with it, I took it outside and set fire to it in my backyard. I've never burned a book before or since but She's Come Undone made me so angry that I couldn't stand the thought of having it in my home. I also didn't want to give it away or donate it anywhere because I didn't want anyone else to have to read it.I think that my real issue with this book was appropriation of voice. Having lived through a similar experience to Dolores, I was initially amazed by Lamb's insight into the situation but as the story went on, I started to see that he didn't really get it at all. In the end, there's no joy, no recovery, no true self-discovery, just sighing acceptance of Dolores' crappy lot in life. What does this say to other survivors of rape? It says ""Why bother trying to make yourself better if this is where you end up?"" Thanks!"
2,Too many typos in Kindle version,"I decided to re-read this great story on my Kindle. Don't bother with the Kindle version. There are so many misspelled words and punctuation errors in it, its ridiculous. Too bad, because it really is worth reading. Buy the book instead."
2,Oprah's Approval = Nothing,"I should have known that if Oprah recommends it, it won't be worth my time. The main character in this book is one of the most unlikeable characters I have ever read about in my life. Not only did I not like her, I kept hoping she would get what was coming to her for blaming every single person in her life for who she was. Was she a victim? Early on, yes. Of course she was. But come on, the assault early in her life was something she blamed on every other person she ever met. By the time she killed the fish, I found myself just wanting someone to slap her. A tremendous waste of my reading time. From now on, Oprah's recommendation on a book cover will make me just move on."
1,I'm not even sure why I picked this book up.,"I thought, perhaps I could finally identify with someone, nothave to read about model-thin girls with their perfect lives andmates, or my usual heavy load of psych books. Boy, was I wrong. Oh,it started off okay. I even sort of pitied poor Dolores. Then, it just got incredibly annoying. There's a point where you just have to suck it in and try to change a life of shambles, and I don't believe she ever did that. Also, the plot was unrealistic. Honestly, how many people get to meet and have sex with a crush from afar on a first date? I was rooting for Dante when he dumped her. Heh. The only character I liked was little Mr. Pucci--he's the only one who seemed to have a little development to him. Take my advice: if you want to read this book, get it from a library. It isn't worth $11.20 (plus shipping and handling)."
1,i'll never get this time back,"this was possibly one of the worst books i have ever read. somebody recommended it to me as a great book so i gave it my very best shot. as i read through every single depressing, graphic and ugly detail of delores' life, i kept reading - thinking it HAD to get better at some point, thinking there HAD to be some redeeming quality somewhere. about 3/4 of the way through, i quit reading and just scanned my way through the rest of it. believe me, i didn't miss anything. this book was absolutely, positively sickening - so disgusting in places, i feel like my brain needs to be scraped of all the filth and ugliness it picked up. i really don't understand what on earth there is to recommend about this book. seriously? life is ugly enough at times without our having to glorify it in print. this is a HORRIBLE book. i threw it in the garbage. i couldn't even bring myself to sell it or give it away. nobody else needs this trash. i wish i could give it less than 1 star."
1,Just awful.,This book ranks right up there with the two worst books I've ever read. It deserves no stars.
2,She's Come Undone,"Very disappointing! I read this book AFTER I read Lamb's I Know This Much Is True, which is one of the BEST books I have ever read. I was so impressed that I had to read his first book. I found the story to be depressing and without a clear point. The struggles of the main character seemed senseless. This book is in no way comparable to his second book - thank goodness! if you want a good read, get a copy of I Know This Much Is True. I can guarantee that you will devour it - it is truly amazing. I cannot say the same for She's Come Undone."
3,"Good book, but where's the humor?","All in all, this was a pretty good read. I've noticed there are a lot of reviews on here about how unlikeable the main character is and how horrible it is to read about her life. To these people I say, wake up! Bad things happen in life. Maybe Wally Lamb threw in a little extra drama in places, but for the most part, the things that happened to Dolores are not so far out there. It is very common and sort of expected that a rape victim would fall into bad relationships, feel depressed, have psychologicakl issues, etc. The book was very realistic. It was, admittedly, rather depressing. But those who want to read only happy fiction should stick to childrens' books. The only thing I will really question about this book are the various reviews on the back cover which claim it to be ""hilarious"" and ""comical"". Huh? I don't think I even felt a glimmer of a smile the entire time I was reading this book!"
5,I was looking for this book for a long time,"Wally lambs""shes come undone "" is for me the most beautiful book I have ever read .The main charactor -Delores , really comes to life I will always remember this book and nothing i have read in the last five years has even come close to this masterpiece.It is just so heart rendering , true , and empathatic .I just wish the author would hurry up and write another fiction book ,Melissa."
4,It's Good,"This book is better than most that you're likely to just pick up. It's not always the happiest book, but it is honest and strightforward,.... no gorgeous heroine or sanitized happily ever after ending. The end message is a good one, learn to accept the people and appreciate the relationships you are given rather than always struggling to bend and create these things to fit your own ideal. You have to suspend some belief in this novel, so I can't say that it is absolutely seamless. How many mysterious benefactors and benefactresses can one hateful, fat, lonely teenaged girl expect to have in a lifetime? But that's a small complaint for an overall terrific book."
5,Profoundly touched and moved,"Of all the novels I've read in my lifetime, this one was by far the most captivating and inspiring. It has made me want to be a better person and make the most out of life. Delores Price is someone to identify with and learn from. I want to personally thank Wally Lamb for writing this beautiful story. And if Delores wasn't fictional (which in a way, I feel she isn't) I would thank her also. I can't wait to read ""I Know This Much is True"" !"
3,a good read..,"This book was interesting enough to keep me going, but I'm not sure I'd rate it as ""an anthem for women"" like one reviewer here does. It certainly didn't have the impact of Marilyn French's ""The Women's Room"" or Doris Lessing's ""The Golden Notebook"". However, it was a good read, and kept me interested to the end. The folks here who say the book was depressing obviously didn't bother to finish it ;-) since it ends on a happy note. I think I'll read ""I Know This Much is True"" since several people here say its even better than this one..."
1,Trite. Predictable. Mean-spirited.,"I labored through the entire book because some friends had highly recommended it, thinking it must get better, it must. It didn't."
1,UGH!,"There is a reason WHY this book was on the $1 table at the discount book store a couple of years ago. It should've stayed there. I'm aghast so many people will run out and relish a book just because a talk show host says to do so. I read this LONG before Ophah gave her review, and I would discourage anyone from reading it now"
4,"Good, but cruel","Overall I liked this book, but despite the insinuation of humor that some reviewers attributed to ""She's Come Undone,"" I found the book to be rather cruel and difficult to read at times. I guess that's the sign of literary talent (Lamb does a remarkable job of writing as a woman), but this book was not as fun to read as the back cover made it out to be. I was ready for a good book and I got it, but I wasn't ready for the cruelty and depression that the book conveyed. I recommend this book, but I would like readers to know that this book will make them sad and possibly even depressed."
1,Aaaaah I hate this book!!!!!,"I wish that zero stars was an option. I had heard such good things about this book but I hate it. Dolores is a character that I pity but can't stand. She represents a lot of what is wrong with society- some horrible things happened to her and now all she does is feel sorry for herself and self-destruct. I can't even finish it, I'm halfway through and I hate it too much to continue. I'll live without knowing how it ends."
2,Not the masterpiece I expected,"A friend of mine heard that this was the first man who was able to effectively write as an overweight woman. I expected someone I could at least understand, if not with whom I could completely empathize. I found neither.Dolores was an embarrasment to both women and overweight people. She, like so many others, makes overweight women look out of control, tattered, tormented, and hateful."
3,Tough start,"I had a difficult time getting into this book. In the beginning, the main character was really mean and disrespectful and I wondered why I was giving my reading time to such negativeness. I kept reading because the family member who gave me the book promised me it would get better. By the middle, I found humor in the absurdities. In the end, Dolores had become a character that I would have appreciated at the start of a story. Maybe flashbacks would have been more appealing to me as a writing style. I gave it 3 stars for Wally's ability to convince readers it was written by a woman, but there was too much mean drama for my tastes."
2,"Nothing compared to ""I Know This Much Is True""","After reading and falling in love with Wally Lambs ""I know this much is true"" I set out to find other books he had written and fell upon this one. The story line bordered boring and interesting, and the plot failed to be recognizable to me. If your looking for a good book, this one doesnt come close."
5,She's Come Undone,"The book She's Come Undone changed my life and was probably the best book that I have ever read. It is a story of love, hate, and everything in between. The story of Dolores is touching and real and I think at some point we can all relate to this emotionally unstable young woman. I was brought into her life and while reading it I somewhat became Dolores. When she cried I cried, and when she laughed I laughed. I felt truly sorry for her as a character. But through all of that, I only know that I will never forget Dolores Price."
4,She's Done Nicely,"In She Comes Undone, Wally Lamb creates a most memorable and damaged character with Dolores Price. The sheer pain and humilation this woman goes through from rape to obesity, a fractured family life and divorce tends to push the character and reader over the edge into depression and despair. Yet this is were Lamb gets his awards, the writing transitions smoothly as you see Delores progress from victim to a scared, jaded survivor. The book is written so well in first person one finds it hard to believe that the author is a man. The only drawback of the book was that the author throws every terrible possible scenerio at Delores to overcome which almost makes this a drama fest, however strong character development, a tight plot and keen details prevent She's Come Undone from being overdone."
4,Pretty tough!,"I read this book in about 3 days - and found it for the most part to be really enjoyable, rather painful, and quite funny. So sad, too. The imagery was quite good - e.g. Dolores shutting herself in the bathroom when a young child and sipping Mylanta to eleviate her nervous stomach. I did feel the way she meets (""hunts down""?) her first husband is pretty far-fetched and eerie. All in all, though, it was what it should have been - good entertainment and a good read. Not every book has to be a Pulitzer, people."
2,Just because it was on Oprah doesn't mean it's any good.,"Honestly, I have never thrown a book in the garbage before. Until this one... What a labored, dismal tale."
5,Fabulous Book...A MUST Read!!!,This is one of the most well written books I have ever read!!! I still cannot believe that it was written by a man. I even gave this book to my mother to read and she loved it as well. I just finished reading another book and found it to be so boring compared to She's Come Undone. I feel like I will be comparing all books to this book for a long time to come! This is a must read!!! I plan to look into other books by Wally Lamb!
4,A quick read despite the 465 pages,"The painful story of Dolores Price, a coming-of-age odyssey. Dolores is cynical and sarcastic and imminently lovable. We cheer for her at the same time that we are embarassed by her. An extremely quick read despite the 465 pages."
3,A Good Ending,"I was expecting this book to be awesome, b/c I had read good reviews about it...and really expected to like it. I was getting bored until around the 3rd/4th chapter and off and on during the book...it wasn't all bad though, and the last 100 pages or so really brought it all together."
4,Absolutely moving!,"She's Come Undone is depressing yet funny all in one novel. Delores Price is a character that every woman can relate to in some way, shape or form and while reading the book, you will think about her every day and wonder what she will experience next. It's hard to believe that a man wrote this book - Wally Lamb is so intuitive to how women think and feel! Everyone should read about Delores Price"
3,not worth it,"i actually tried to give this book a chance. at first it was pretty good, but it all went down hill from there Delores was pretty depressing."
3,She's Come Undone,She's Come Undone was a good book. The beginning and ending were both excellent. The middle started to lose my attention but never did. I liked it and think it is worth reading.
5,The best book i have read in years,"This book is a literary masterpiece, Wally Lamb writes in such way that you truely belive is possible it could happend. I love it and I can identify with the character Dolores Price. You should totally read it."
3,Don't read if you're on antidepressants,This book was a slow start and extremely depressing for most of the story. I had hoped for a better ending but I don't know if that would have made the journey of this book any better...
3,'Twas Ok,"This book was good enought for me to keep wanting to read it but it isn't what I wold all a great work of writing.I did think that Wally Lamb did an excellent portrayal of a female character but the book just didn't do it for me. Although I did feel sorry for Dolores with all that she has been through and the ending made me happy.It was witty too, I found myslef laughing. But, like I said it just wasn't that all impressive."
2,It's depressing all right!,"I found this book as depressing as everyone else who's written a review. I also couldn't put it down, but that's only because I kept thinking it was going to get better, that Dolores' life couldn't get any worse. Boy was I surprised. Now that I've finished it, the characters and their problems keep coming to mind. This is definitely one I wouldn't recommend to a friend."
2,When WASN'T she undone?,"I am a big reader, and when I picked this up I expected it to be a beautifully written, charming story... considering how captivated I am with Oprah. However the characters in this novel have all gone to hell in back. Without a loveable character in the bunch, and most of them with broken, miserable lives it just leaves you with a feeling of remorse for the entire human race! Looking at other reviews written by others on this same page, they refer to this book as 'real', and 'tells it like it is'. Now that's down right depressing! This book is definetly different... but for me, that 'different is not the kind I prefer, or consider interesting. Go ahead and read it, just know that it's not a happy, fun, book. If I would compare it to another book I've read I'd have to say it would be another Oprah Books club book, ""What looks like crazy on an ordinary day"". Come on Oprah, enough of the downers."
5,WOW!,"I have read some of the other reviews and I am stunned that there are actually people who didn't like this book. It's one of the best I have ever read. Dolores is a real person, has real, true-to-life crisis and possesses just the right amount of self loathing and optimism to pull this off. Had I read this book not knowing the auther was a male, it would have been a fantastic story, but knowing that Mr. Lamb can get inside the female's psyche so well makes this story seem flawless. I raise my glass to you, Mr. Lamb, and look forward to more of the same."
2,Not a good book for one with manic-depression like myself...,"A friend told me I just had to read this book... all I have to say is that true friends don't let friends read Wally Lamb. I think the main problem with this book is that you have to hate the main character. Everytime anything really bad happens to Dolores (the MC) she just does something completely evil as a reaction to make you despise her. Liiike... she decides to have a gay encounter with some woman (I believe her name was Dottie). And throughout the book all Dottie talks about is how much she looooves her little fish. Anyhow, after Dolores has her *encounter* she gets up and poisons all of Dottie's fish because she's 'depressed'. Yeah, bite me, you're depressed... so go and kill some defenseless animals. Really, don't read this book if you fight depression yourself and don't read it if you actually expect some good material."
2,Bore-fest,"Plodding plot, lack of insight and sensitivity. Some of the most boring fiction dialogue i've seen in a long time. Figures that Oprah liked it because it deals with a fat woman, but other than that it is terrible story telling."
2,wanted to read it but couldn't...,"i just couldnt finish it. it was too ""sophocating"". some descriptions rather disgusting. wally's portrayal of women badly done. didn't buy the female characters voice in the novel."
3,"If you value your time, this book may not be for you","I have to say, that I wanted very much to like this book. Even up until the end, I was waiting to be redeemed. Unfortunately, it just didn't happen. After a long, twisted journey full of downs and downs, I never found the up. And don't we all need an occasional ""up""?Overall, this really is a depressing read. Sorry Wally."
1,WAY too depressing,"Yes, Wally Lamb is talented. He somehow managed to jam about everything wrong with our society into the life of one woman. The only reason I kept reading it was in the hopes that her life would get better. It didn't. She went whale watching. This book is very well-written, but that doesn't help because it just makes you more depressed because you feel like you're there with her. So... read this book if you want punishment."
4,"Undone, well done","I picked this up after having had my copy for several years. It was a little slow to start, but ""She's Come Undone"" is the kind of book that becomes very addictive. It is tragic, fascinating reading. I am, however, mystified by reviews that characterize this as funny, though, because while wild, warped, sometimes amusing and totally absorbing, it's not really funny.The detail with which Mr. Lamb writes is so vivid, this books plays like a movie in your head as you read. You can almost taste the curtains Delores chews on and visualize the ""flying leg"" painting her mother gives her. And you can feel her sadness, her desire to connect, her longing for love and acceptance. He has created a character I know, and when we part ways at the end, I really care about her and hope that her future is happy at last.I gave this book to my 18-year-old stepdaughter and now she's equally mesmerized."
3,Ok book--but not as good as I Know This Much Is True!,I read this book AFTER I read I Know This Much is True and I was disappointed in this book. I KNOW was much better. This was torturous to go through...not recommended. Sorry.
3,"She's Come Undone -- Literally, that is until the End","Well, I opened this book, hopeful. I thought, ""OK"" its an Oprah Book Club selection, surely it should be good. Well, the book was slow, depressing and hard to keep reading, but just as I felt as though I was about to come UNDONE, I got to one of the best chapters of the book...when she met Dante...it was truly uplifting the way Wally Lamb brought you into this woman's life and watched her grow from a selfish brat into a self less, independent woman. It was truly a book worth reading."
1,Waste of time!,"I read this book because of its great reviews, however I am greatly disappointed. It only made me dislike the main character and feel depressed. I continued through the entire book waiting for something worthwhile to come out of it but it never did. I feel that when Dolores finally changed for the better, it was like she was a totally different character. My advice to you is, don't waste your time on this one."
3,"Good, but not Great","She's Come Undone is by all means an entertaining book. However, Lamb fails in some crucial points, and at crucial moments. Dolores is often an unbelievable character, and just when she seems to be making important changes in her life, he sums it all up in two or three words, often ending sentences with unnecessary exclamation marks. The hype about She's Come Undone being written by a man is often unjustified. Yes, a writer should have an imagination, and so to write a character of the opposite sex is justifiable; however, Lamb often portrayed Dolores based on stereotypes of women, making the fact that the book was indeed written by a man glaringly obvious. I'd recommend this book for a bus ride or to take to the beach, but nothing more."
3,This chick is irritating and exasperating,"Of the three Wally Lamb books I've read, I liked this one the least. ""She's Come Undone"" follows Dolores Price through her troubled life, which includes a philandering father, psychotic mother, terrifying childhood rape, stint in a mental hospital, horrible marriage, massive weight gain and loss, etc., etc., etc.For me, the big problem with this book is that I really disliked Dolores immensely pretty much right off the bat. I tried to sympathize with her as much as I could, but it was hard when she annoyed me more and more with every page. As a result, this novel dragged on and on and ON, and I was thrilled when I finished just because that meant I never had to deal with this sappy girl ever again. I do not recommend this book; however, check out Lamb's ""I Know This Much is True,"" which is absolutely brilliant."
2,Not a good read if you are depressed or have anxiety!!,"I started this book months ago, put it down, read all my other books, and finally read it out of desperation. Once I got past the first few chapters it was hard to put down. I kept hoping that Delores's life would perk up, but when it seemed to be getting better everything would fall apart again. There are TOO many depressing events to process. Unfortunately this book has left me with a ton of anxiety and a lump in my throat. I do like the author's style of writing and this is why I give this a two star. I can't imagine why anyone would say this book is ""hilarious."" Obviously, that individual didn't read this book cover to cover."
3,Does not live up to the hype!,"People kept telling me that I had to read this book. Finally, I gave in to pressure and bought it.While it was an interesting story, most of the characters were awful! There was not one character I actually cared about through the entire book.Dolores was simply a dysfunctional baby! Quite frankly, I just wanted to slap her and tell her to shut up and stop whining.Her mother was useless. Her grandmother was a racist (and was useless).Mr. Lamb should have spent a little more effort on character development."
4,Very entertaining and uplifting novel!!,"""She's Come Undone"" is a great novel. Just when you think Dolores' life couldn't be worse, Lamb really outsmarts the reader with a new compelling, tramautic and detailed disaster. I recommend this book to all those people who are about to give up on life and being happy."
1,Yuck...hated it!,"I had heard that people really liked this book or really hated it...I'm glad I got mine from the local library because I did not like it at all, in fact I didn't even bother to finish it."
1,Did I miss something?,"I could not get into this book at all. The pace was slow and the characters were uninteresting. I can't waiting for a ""good part"" but never got it. The story just did not do anything for me. A waste of money."
1,I was very bored with this book,"I kept waiting for the story to ""pick up"". It never did. I found it to be a very depressing read."
1,I was very disappointed after having read I Know This...,The further I got into this book the more I disliked it. After awhile I became very annoyed with the main character. I DO NOT RECOMMNED THIS NOVEL!!
1,TERRIBLE,"Oh, please. I did not read this book because it was on Oprah's list. I read it because I heard that it was so good. Well, it wasn't. Lamb thinks he can write from a woman's point of view but he just can't. I doubt that he experienced any of the things that the main character did. He has no idea how one might express these feelings and deal with them. I must admit that I can see why Oprah reccomended it. (the whole bit with losing weight seems very fimilar) I thought that Oprah had better taste, I guess I was wrong. Next time Wally ""write what you know."""
1,"Dull, misogynistic drivel","How very sad that this book is held up in such high regard. I read this for a book club and had to force myself through it with great difficulty. Not a single character in the book is likeable, not a single scene realistic.On top of that, it is the most misogynistic book I have read in a long time. the author piles horrible incident upon horrible incident on the hapless Dolores. While some may view this as empathetic, in fact it's horribly cruel-- it's as if the (male) author is continually saying-- ""watch what I'm going to do to her next.""It's poorly written, obvious, drivel."
1,Absolutely HATED this book,"I HATED this book along with Dolores. This book was a total waste of my time and money. It's a shame that the ""heroine""(certainly not someone I'd want my daughters to look up to) was someone who blamed society for the outcome of her life instead of herself, I tried to like Dolores but couldn't- heck, I even tried to pity her. This book left me depressed. I didn't even save it to pass it along to a friend (wouldn't do that to a friend) I threw it out."
1,"Contrived, depressing, waste of an evening","I was fascinated by the book reviews on the cover. Being overweight myself, I thought the character was someone I could relate to. However, Dolores gives overweight people, and women in general a bad name. Her character is Judy Blooms Blubber meets Steven King. She is mean, hateful and vicious before she was raped and even before her parents fought. I was disgusted with her in the first chapter, and the feeling did not die. The author has no sense of what is like to be an adolescent girl. Lamb seemed to use Dolores's weight as the avenue for the reader pity. His use of language was pathetic and his characterization were cookie cutter of a dysfunction home. This novel was outlined carefully to pull at heart strings, yet it pushes every ounce of sympathy for the main character out the door along with my respect for Oprah for recommending this book."
2,She's come unread,"It's hard to tell if this author dislikes men or women more. From a painful portrayal of a astonishingly dysfunctional family to the sputtering end this book grinds on and on. Almost no-one is likable in this story, especially the heroine. There should be a truth in advertising clause for book jackets that state: ""...often stirring and hilarious book"" What's hilarious? A self-destructive teenager whose every adult influence betrays her with their selfishness? And so it goes. I did finish the book, in the vain hopes that there would be some redeeming grace in the story."
1,horrible,i could not get into this book. it was depressing. i forced myself to finish it and it was a pleasure to be done with it...dont waste your time
2,Not what I was looking for...,"Wally Lamb is a talented writer, and as I read this book, I really couldn't believe a man wrote this and wrote with the raw emotion of a female writer. But the second I finished the book, I knew I am not a fan of ""coming of age"" types of books, maybe its because I'm young, I'm not sure, but the whole thing was so depressing for me, thats it, depressing. Not the kind of book that really changes your outlook on anything, it was empty and left no lasting impression on me except the sad-sorry feeling I felt for the protagonist. I thought leaving a lasting impression was the whole point of having ""coming of age"" books..."
2,Dumb and completely unbelievable.,"I want my money back! This books was utterly ridiculous. Ibought this, not only because it was Oprah's choice, but because ofall the hype, ""you won't believe a man wrote it"" etc. It was SOOOO dumb it was painful. There was nothing even female about this character. Instead the author reinforces stereotypes of female sexualy and psychology, giving a voice to a sterotype rather than a character. Though I finished it, I tuned out about half-way through. I WANTED to like this book, but insulting, ludicrous plots and dialogues kept getting in the way. The only reason this got a 3 was because the author does have a decent enough writing style. Now if he could only learn a thing or two about character development..."
1,What a sorry excuse for literature!,"The only reason I did not stop reading this bookand throw it out, was that I kept thinking thestory would begin on the next page - it never did! I pity the author's sad images of what makes a story, and what constitutes life. All that paper used up, and nothing to say.Worst book of the year (at least)!Bill Barth, Sr.Gaithersburg, Maryland"
4,Good up until the very end.,"With the exception of the deus ex machina at the end, the book was very real. It's hard to believe that a man wrote this story that was so realistically seen through the eyes of it's woman characters. Wonderful, a much recommended read."
4,Hang on for the ending.,"BEWARE before starting this book!. I found the entire thing rather depressing. It is weird to be so drawn in to someone else's misery, but that is precisely what happens. I am amazed that I made it through, but something kept me hoping that, eventually, Delores' life would improve. The strangest thing is that the end of the book seemed to make it all worthwhile. This is definitely NOT for people who cannot abide graphic details, as they are disturbingly portrayed. I don't think the author being male should be an issue, since he glossed over things that any female would know were crucial in life (like the abortion). Overall, though, it was a good read, if only to realize that something good will happen if you just wait the misery out"
1,A huge disappointment.,"On the cover, the NY Times says this book is hilarious. It's about as hilarious as a trauma center. I was happy when Part I ended because I thought ""Now, it will get better"". Felt the same way at the end of Part II. It was sad and depressing from beginning to end. Yes, the author writes like a woman, but that's a pretty weak way to market a book. If it had been written by a woman, I doubt that this book would have received much acclaim. I was thoroughly disappointed"
4,Enlightening and entertaining; interesting plot twists,"The true value of this novel is not in Lamb's outstanding writing, but rather the fantastic plot and quirky characters.As a 16 year-old able to identify with many of Delores' sorrows (intentional play on words?), I couldn't help but feel pity - and frustration - with her character. What I liked was her sarcastic sense of humor and bitter take on reality. Delores is not a heroine, an archetype, or guru; she is an eager storyteller who can't help but interject her opinion at every possible chance.This book will never be a classic, but is definitely worth reading, if only for the cool cover art."
4,Heart warming....,This is a fantastic book to read. It follows a life of a character name Dolores Price from childhood to adulthood. You will follow her traumas through her life wondering when she will find love and happiness. The ending is heartwarming that makes you want to cry. Read this book and you will find a book that has touched your heart. I would recommend this book to anyone to read.
5,From a male reader...,"One of my two favorite books as of recent. Just an enjoyable journey with the main character Delores! Excellent character study...all of them flawed like the real world. My other favorite is, This Is Where I Leave You, by Tropper. Enjoy!"
5,Couldnt put it down!,Very easy read. Could not put this book down. Didn't realize it was a male author until half way through book. Very surprising.
3,Not as good as Lamb's 2nd book.,"I read this book, his first, after I read I Know This Much Is True. I loved that one and looked forward to reading more by Lamb. While I enjoyed this book, it did not hold my interest or attention nearly so much as I Know This Much Is True. The title character, while a tragic figure, was not very likeable and I found it hard to have much empathy for her. The ending did somewhat please me although if I had read this book first, I'm not sure I would have tried anything else by Lamb. I highly recommend his second book and would try anything else he writes."
5,shes come undone,This book held my interest. It took some twists and turns and taught me some things about a different type of personality
5,Great Book!,A touching story. I loved following Dolores' life and living her sad times and happy times with her. You won't be disappointed.
4,This book was utterly depressing but also hopeful.,"The girl in this book had every single thing that could harm someone. From sexual abuse to her own divorce, Dolores could not possibly have become more mixed up. Yet there is hope, because after all that has happened to her, the end leads you to belive that she might be happy. Truly a gift of life and wonder."
2,mediocre at best,"Reading this book is like rubbernecking: you know you shouldn't, but you just can't help it. Everything terrible that can happen to one person happens to the narrator of this book. It is unrealisitic, barely mediocre in terms of writing style, and reminds me of a soap opera at times, which is the reason I finished it. It propells you, open-mouthed, to keep reading and see what other wretched things this woman will endure. If lightweight reading is what you're looking for, this would be a good choice. I was dissapointed with Oprah for recommending this; she must be friends with Wally Lamb."
5,"A scary, funny glimpse into the abyss of self-hatred","I could not stop thinking about Dolores after I finished this book. Wally Lamb really captured the thoughts and actions of a depressed, lonely and masochistic girl/woman. I could empathize with the character on a very small scale, which was frightening in and of itself. I just wanted to slap Dolores, and kept thinking is there anyone out there like Dolores? Probably, and it scares me!"
3,"It reads just like a rollercoaster, ups and downs.","I found myself becoming Dolores' personal cheerleader. I kept reading with the hope that her life would turn around without any more catastrophies. Unfortunately, more terror and pain was waiting for her at every turn. It became clear that this poor woman would continue on the path of bad luck. I have about 20 more pages to go and frankly, I don't know if I can take any more."
4,Emotional Roller coaster,"I read this book over a year ago and its content still plagues me from time to time. Readers are taken on an emotional roller coaster ride through Delores's life-literally. You might find this book hard to read at times- not because it is written poorly (which it definitely isn't) but because it highlights the ebbs and flows of a woman we just want to reach out and help. Her past is painful, to say the least. While the length may deter you (it's a hefty read) it was well worth it. I still remember this woman as if she was an old friend, which, in my opinion, portrays an excellent book."
5,An Amazing Read for All Ages,"I was 14 when I first read this book. It amazed me. The depth with which Lamb wrote the story- from a girl's point of view- astounded me.My mother ws 42 when she read this book. She also loved it.I believe that Lamb, in the most distasteful of situations, made this book tasteful. To describe the book would not be fair- it is in a genre all its own, and the wonderfulness of it cannot be put into words.Believe me- I know a good book when I see one. Read this book- I promise you will love it!"
4,Heroines,"Dolores Price is the best heroine I've ever read about in a book in ages. Witty and tragic, depressed and comical, she weaves all these traits into beautiful tapestry that is her eventful life. This book, through Dolores Price, puts real truth in every cliche, from ""What doesn't kill us makes us stronger"" to ""Tomorrow will be a better day."" I couldn't help but quiver my lip at the ending. An astounding novel!"
4,"Great read, colorful characters, bittersweet and believable","Really surprised how much I liked this book. At first, I was just using it as something to read before bedtime, but then as the main character developed, I wound up staying up way past my bedtime! I had to find out how Dolores would deal with her dilemmas. I could also relate to the events as I grew up in the same time period (60s and 70s). Interesting, smirky and at times very subtly poignant. I laughed out loud and cried throughout her experiences. I feel like I know Dolores Price and I would be honored to have her as a friend."
5,She's Come Undone is the most touching book anyone can read,"In the novel 'She's Come Undone' Wally Lamb offers a life-altering story about a girl from age four to forty. If I had to pick only one book to recommend for somebody to read, there would be no contest, I would pick She's Come Undone. It is easy to understand so anyone can enjoy it. Dolores Price becomes almost part of your family. She will remind you of yourself while searching the many depths of the human soul. Dolores is an idol to many. She will fill any empty feeling in your heart with warm fuzzies from head to toe."
4,Engulfing,"Dolores' compulsive tendancies and desire to bury the pain that has been heaped on her most of her life, draws the reader in. I found myself talking to her in my head as I read. Wanting to reach out to her and direct her onto a path of healing. I found myself frustrated that I was mearly an observer of her life. That is how a reader should feel. Wally Lamb is able to get you involved in the story without making you aware that it is happening. I would definately recommend both this book as well as his other book, ""I Know This Much is True."""
2,Not as good as _I Know This Much Is True_,"I was disappointed by this novel. It didn't fit together as well as _I Know This Much Is True_. I kept wanting Delores to be happy but instead the story dragged on and got depressing. Delores came across as a weakling in the middle of the novel; she lost some of her sass. I would suggest reading Wally Lamb's second novel, _I Know This Much Is True_ instead of this one."
4,"Exceptional comming of age story, the best I have ever read","This novel is the most touching comming of age story I have ever read. Reading about Dolores, the main character made me feel the emotions she has felt, and at certian points the book made me cry. After you pick up this book, you may see a whole other side in life. The only thing blocking me as to say this is my favorite book, is because after reading it I felt somewhat depressed. No one wants to be depressed, but everyone wants to read a novel that draws the reader in. Wally Lamb did an exceptional job."
5,A True-to-Life Psychological Journey of Healing.,"Her life may seem like a soap opera to some, but, to those whose lives have been touched by abuse, loss, abandonment or betrayal, Dolores is a heroineand a role-model. She struggles to heal herself despite seemingly insurrmountable odds. We are with her as she slides into mental illness.And because of Wally Lamb's emotionally honest and detailed writing we can sympathize with her deterioration. In the same way we are uplifted as she struggles with the demons and emerges triumphant, though not unscathed. I recommend this book to anyone who has been emotionally harmed and wonders how to struggle out of the abyss."
3,Everything you never want to be,"""She's Come Undone"" is truly the story of the girl you never aspired to be. Don't begin this book looking for a feel-good story. Wally Lamb is a terrific writer; so much so that it is easy to forget that a man wrote the female main-character, Dolores. Yet Dolores's story is sad and depressing and not at all inspiring. I found myself at conflict with myself as I read: struggling to keep reading this book but also to put it down! ""She's Come Undone"" should be light-reading material; and although it is definitely a quick read, I would not recommend taking this book on vacation."
4,A Look into the reality of others...,"It is scary when an author describes your life as accurately asWally Lamb manages to give life to Dolores Price. My life has notbeen exactly as the character, but close enough. After reading it, Ihad an epifany. Dolores helped me to see where I could change my lifefor the better. It is an inspirational book and I can see why Oprahwould choose a wonderful book as this. I just finished it; it was myfirst ""Oprah Cook Club"" read. It was perfect. I loved mostevery page. I could have done without most of the vulgarity oflanguage, but it adds to the richness of the hard life Doloressuffers. I wouldn't change a thing! The book was wonderful and Icould identify richly with this character."
4,She's Come Undone,"This is without a doubt one of the best books that I have read in a very long time. I laughed, I cried, but most of all I related to this tale of self-awaking and struggle. What I like most about the heroine, Dolores, is that she is a real person with real flaws-she lies, she steals letters, and gets into a relationship with a man who is bad for her- but I still want to love her and cheer her on. However, don't take my word for this-read the book!"
3,Interesting Reading,"I thought a lot of the images in this story were unsettling, but I think everyone knows a person like this. A person that spends their whole life trying to fit in. I think the book was very well written and it made you want to read on."
5,Excellent book,Took me back to the 60's. Had to keep looking at the cover to make sure it was written by a man! This was an excellent book - my daughter (age 25) and I both really enjoyed it.
2,Interesting but not compelling,I just finished reading She's Come Undone. I finished it because I wanted to find out if the main character had any redeeming qualities. I couldn't believe that anyone or any character in a book could constantly make such poor choices or continue to view situations in the worst possible way. I read to the end because I had to believe that Dolores does something positive about her life and her situation. She does begin to develop a backbone and improve her lot in life. For that reason I think the ending is the best part of the book as she becomes a more realistic character. The one truly positive thing about the book is that it gives the reader a true glimpse of what it is to live with mental illness. I developed more empathy for those who suffer with depression and other mental problems.
5,Wally Lamb gets to the heart of being a fat girl,"Wally Lamb rips out the throat of the reader in She's Come Undone, a gut-wrenching, sometimes stomach churning account of Dolores, an obese girl. Starting with her childhood, he paints a vivid picture of dysfunction, codependence, and ultimately addiction, brought on by a well meaning mother and an inability to deal with the feelings she carries. Dolores is in actuality a Phoenix, destined to rise to face all the challenges a ""normal"" life holds. While emotionally charged and heartbreaking, this book is a must read for anyone who has been obese. Wally Lamb hit the nail on the head with this book."
2,DON'T READ THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"...well, if you're the type that only reads one book per year-wally lamb is your man... but to the more experianced reader, lamb never delivers...She's come undone is an admirable effort but i've read better...i can see where lamb intended to go but his attempt landed near the middle-quite frankly this book is a badly written ""coming into life"" story...what the hell was Oprah thinking when she recommended this to the public...the book is nothing but sheer gratuitous entertainment...you might as well go out and buy a bunch of ""pulp romance novels""..."
4,Mr. Lamb has written an utterly engrossing tale.,"This story served to inspire even the most cynical soul. The story of the main character explicitly depicts how one persons life can be filled with tremendous hardships and turmoil. Yet, through all these challenges, the human spirit can still prevail. A definite page-turner that keeps the reader continually wondering what will happen next."
2,She's Come Undone is not worth the read.,"I firsted noticed She's Come Undone listed in the Quality Paperback Book Club. It was recommended as a great book demonstrating a woman's strength to overcome adversity. Now I see it is listed as an Oprah recommendation -- too bad. I found the book tiring and depressing. The heroine, Dolores, is self-involved and her life spirals down into mental illness. While some may enjoy the book's quirky style, I was too disturbed by the book's content and negativity to enjoy the read."
4,Depressing yet captivating,"With every turn of the page I waited for the next catastophe to strike poor Dolores. Her father's abandonment and mother's emotional illness lay the foundation of instability that cannot handle the trauma of rape. Repression, obesity and mental collapse follow. Every time Dolores seems on the verge of finally pulling herself up, she is beaten down again either by circumstance or by her own rage. She squanders opportunities and makes poor choices, but this is to be expected from someone with her history. Although her reactions to people and situations are often so frustrating that I was tempted to stop reading, I just had to keep turning the pages to see what was to become of her."
2,The most depressing book I have ever read,This book made me depressed for days. I could not believe that everything that could go wrong for the main charcter did. The character endured every mality known to man.
2,"Some strong points, but a lot of shortcomings","The first few chapters of this book were interesting. Then it slowly declined. Wally Lamb went from poignant to trashy in a matter of six chapters. He portrays Delores Price as a weak, stupid boar who has nothing better to do than eat and fall in love with the wrong people. Delores makes the female gender look weak and easy to take advantage of. I thought that whole lesbian scenario was a waste of paper and words. Mr. Lamb, you can use your talent in better places"
4,Great read,I was quite worried about how much I could relate to the main character in this book on some of her feelings. This poor girl seemed to have so much happen to her in life. The book kept me reading and rooting for her from the beginning to the end!
4,Lengthy Inspiration,"When I picked up this book I was immediately turned off... it said Oprah's Book Club on the cover. I brought it home anyway (I had to read it for school)I hated Delores, thought she was detestable, crude and selfish but somewhere during the course of the story you fall in love with her.Delores experiences so much in her one life that many of us could only experience over several lives. She always seems to come through even though she has strange ways of dealing with herself. It is an inspirational tale of a young spirit that was broken and revived over and over.I closed this long book with satisfaction (well almost.. I do have to write a report on it now). I would most definately recommend it to anyone who needs a spirit uplift or just a way to escape life for a few hours.Wally Lamb does an incredible job of portraying a young female. Excellent book."
4,A DOWN TO EARTH AND ENTERTAINING BOOK,"IT'S NOT REALLY A ""HARD TO PUT DOWN ""BOOK BUT IT GIVES MAXIMUM IMPACT ON ONE'S PERSPECTIVE OF LIFE AFTER READING THROUGH DOLORES' EXPERIENCE IN LIFE. YES, HER EXPERIENCES ARE UNBELIEVABLE BUT SO ARE OURS!! I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO A FRIEND BUT IT WON'T BE THE FIRST BOOK THAT WOULD COME TO MIND."
4,Could be better...why the huge hairy deal?,"I read this book on a whim and a recommendation of someone I respect a great deal but who seems to dislike me a great deal. (We sort of avoid each other because I don't want to piss him off into hatred.) I tried to explain it and summarize it as an English assignment but the summary was 3 pages long. It's a complex book. It got mixed reviews, so I guess it's not for everyone. It gets a tad soap opera-y at times but I don't know if it ever varies from what could be a real person's life. I don't know if I'd generally recommend it, but if sexuality doesn't bother you and you love reading about eventual triumph, read it."
4,Highly entertaining,"This book was not life changing, but a great read. I couldn't put the book down until I finished it. I find myself missing Dolores."
5,I'm thankful for this wonderful book,"When I finished the last page of this book, I cried. Wally Lamb has taken the chaotic life of a sexual abuse survivor and made some sense out it! Dolores' weight gain, inability to trust people and make friends, and struggle with depression mirrors the life of many sexual abuse/rape victims. Her vigilant struggle to regain her self-esteem and some control over her life is an inspiration. I will not soon forget Dolores' transformation from a victim into someone who discovers the healing power of loving others. I saw my own life in this book, and I'm grateful for the journey. I will miss Dolores...."
3,Odd book... but not bad,"This book was kind of odd. Not my usual read. A little confusing in some scenes, and a few scenes with images I could have lived without. All in all, not a bad read, but not something I would necessarily recommend to someone if they asked me for a good book. It would be more of a fifty cent pile at a yard sale kind of book."
2,Disappointing,"It's nice to see a male writer capture a woman's voice so well that it's hard to believe a man wrote the words that Lamb did. Still, Dolores' feistiness doesn't make up for the book's other faults. The writing lacks any sort of subtlety: every time Dolores makes a realization, the narration kind of hits you over the head with it until even a six-year-old could get it. It was kind of insulting. Then there was the constant victimization of Dolores by man after man; it got really really annoying watching Dolores hang on to the men victimizing her. She seems feisty, but at times she was so pathetic I winced."
2,Falls apart in the second half...,"The book is initially gripping, and certainly keeps you hungry for more- but about half way thru is moves from the sublime to the ridiculous. The character is so strongly crafted you develop a strong sense of who she is- but that person eventually just vanishes. This is not to say that people don't change, but all the points about Dolores that we come to love or hate or pity move too far into the background. At this same time, the ludicrous story line takes over and is pasted together with unplausable ""coincidences"", i.e. 'just happens' to recieve pictures of Dante, 'just happens' tere is a vacant apartment across from his, 'just happens' this gigolo doesn't have a girlfriend, on and on... I think this is a book for adolecent girls, not mature women. Disappointing."
1,Why bother?,Read this book several years ago - and now I see it's in everyone's hand (thanks to Oprah?). One of the few book I quit after three chapters - no redeeming value that I could perceive then or now.
1,What's the big deal?,"What a pitiful group of characters!! I don't get why people loved this book so much. I love Oprah, but I don't get why most of the books she picks are so full of dysfunctional people. The book centered too much on sex and bad language. Why is it that authors these days have to use this kind of language to get their point across? (What was Wally Lamb's point anyway?) Dolores was the hero, yet she was noone to admire. She was a lot like people today. A lot of what happened to her was her fault, yet she didn't take responsibility for much. I'm left wondering why I wasted the time. What an insult to read the last chapter. After such a dysfunctional life, we're supposed to believe that everything's ok and she lives happily ever after?"
1,Done With She's Come Undone,"Can you say sucked? I am sorry to come across as crude but this book was absolutely ridiculous. I have never read such trash in my life. I, like many others, was strung along by all the raving reviews this book received. However, to be quite honest not only is the book depressing, it's depressing that so many people could find the tremendous amount of sorrow the character faces entertaining, let alone someone to be placed on a pedalstool for inspiration. Horror after horror does not make for a very interesting plot as far as I am concerned and the book could have easily be made shorter. I only finished because I owed myself that much. I certainly echo another reader's sentiments. A waste of time, money and energy!"
1,Gratuitous sexual assaults -- Enough already!,"I get so peeved at the way authors use sexual assault as a best-seller formula. Enough hurt woman books! I found this book soooo unbelievable, so madening. Here is a MAN writing about periods, masterbation and sexual assault. I've got to say, having experienced all three, what Lamb writes isnt' even close to the truth.I'm tired of formula hurt-woman books: 1) she gets her period all over the place, 2) endless masterbation to ""wet underpants,"" and 3) let's not forget to throw in there getting assaulted sexually by someone she knows. Could we have a best seller without it??! ""Poor girl. Look at her. What a good book.""Argh! Enough! I actually chucked the book across the room. Why must I be subjected to this stuff in everything I read these days? How insensitve!! Popular literature seems to involve nothing else these days. Give me a break. Have we lost all imagination?"
2,Dissapointing,"I expected to love this book. It was recommended to me by my AP english teacher. I had enjoyed most of the titles I'd chosen from his list of recommendations, so I expected to love this book too. This ""heroine"" was unforgettable as most reviewers have claimed but not because of her uniqueness but rather because of her overwhelming life. Most stories focus on a character overcoming a siginificant obstacle in thier life but Dolores had to overcome at least a dozen obstacles, all of which were run of the mill dramatic issues. I never felt connected with Dolores or concerned for her. There was nothing entertaining, enlightening,or admirable about her. She had a seriously depressing life and I found her journey not in the least worthwhile. Sorry for trashing on this book that so many people love but i really just found it to be quite ordinary."
1,One word: CLICHE'!!!!!,"Wally Lamb has a knack for taking other people's problems, finding all of the stereo-typical character traits that go with said problem, and writing a depressing, unimaginative and quite uninspiring story. I threw the book away. Something I never do no matter how bad!"
1,How much can I hate Dolores???,"I picked this book up in an airport on the way to Hawaii thinking it would be a good plane/beach read--and in a sense, it was: totally mindless and unengaging reading involving a heroine whom I couldn't care less about and tasteless material that made me pray no one was reading over my shoulder. It's been my experience that Oprah's reads tend to be these pseudo-politically-correct works that are conniving and manipulative, and ""She's Come Undone"" certainly falls into this category."
2,"Trashy Book, Impossible Story, Written by a Man","It was a fast read. And it's a good thing, because otherwise I would not have given it the time of day. I picked it up expecting a good story and good literature because so many people rave about how great they think this book is, but I was very dissapointed. First of all, it is written in a way that can potentially convince you it's a possible story. It is diary-style and mentions T.V shows and other books, just like a real diary would. But the story and characters are just too impossible. Yes, life can be tough, but an unrellenting assault of bad fortune, as happens to Dolores just doesn't happen in real life. And, I know people that have lived through being raped and dealing with parents deaths without all the emotional damage that afflicts Dolores. The symbolism in this novel was also a joke. Every time a whale was mentioned I actually laughed out loud, could you get any more cliche?"
2,Hilarious? I don't think so.,"Why is the word ""hilarious"" even mentioned when describing the character Dolores Price? She is a troubled, twisted individual who is mean not only to the people around her but to herself as well. There is nothing even remotely ""hilarious"" or comical about the characters or the book's plot. It is a depressing, downtrodden look at self-loathing, self-pity, self-indulgence, mental illness, abuse and sadness. It is NOT an enjoyable read at all; it is depressing from start to finish. (And some of the plot turns are so highly implausible, like finding the guy whose photos Dolores intercepted from her college roommate on a random roll of film - please.) Yes, Wally Lamb is an excellent writer, but - man - this book is just an overall downer. I need something like and fruity to cleanse my palate after this book."
2,Bottomline...I feel better about myself,Overall it was a well written book (the author can tell a story and the editors did their jobs). However the content was a little hard to take in. I often found myself having faith that the next page will have something good for Dolores but I was left disappointed. It was sad and slow with no real closure of every tragedy in her life unless it ended up in death. I often heard that this was a great book and was waiting to see where it was so great. It wasn't so great.
1,"Oh Good God, Come On People.......","Did Oprah really read this book? For God's sake..... I think she just saw "" unfortunate overweight girl"" and put it on the list....I have seen better character development in Curious George books. Okay, let's talk about it. Fat girl eats raw meat, sits down beside whale, ( I feel you pain), eats a lot of food, battles all kinds of stuff that normal people never even think about, loses weight, has sex, and does okay...and through it all, manages to have a rather annoying personality and overall bad attitude. So, she is pretty much the girl that gets picked up at last call. Thumbs down."
1,sadly dissapointing,im sorry but wally lamb tries to portay this side of womanhood that he obviously knows nothing about. he has a complete lack of insight. he tries to show all these problems women can have except he does it to ONE woman and its unrealistic.
2,"Hard to get through this one, too much whining","I found this book very difficult to get through. The main character -- who has obvious mental instability -- has a life that gets worse page by page. Then, not only does she whine about it, continuously I might add, she does increasingly stupid things so that her life only ends up even more pathetic. Finally, when I got to the point where I thought.... ""Okay, she's hit rock bottom, she can't do anything else stupid,"" she starts getting too conceited to treat decently the ONE person in the whole book who reaches out to love her and wants a life with her. Amazing. I had been recommended this book by a few friends, and was very, very disappointed. I kept thinking this woman should have been put in a mental institution -- which happens -- but never let out."
1,stupid,I must be the only person thinking this book is really stupid. I can't even use another word. Stupid. Nothing against the author. I chose this book because Oprah said it was great. Sure fooled me
2,Strange Book,"I purchased a first edition of this book when it was first released but never read it. Since Wally Lamb has come out with his newest long ""dark"" novel, I decided to finally pluck it off the shelf.I won't go into detail about how ridiculous this book is because there are plenty of reviews to atest to this. Simply put, its a silly novel, more like ""chick lit"", and one should best spend their time between the covers of good literature. There are too many good books to read and very little time. Skip this one as I did for many years."
1,I hate it,"I read Wally Lamb's book, Couldn't Keep It To Myself, and found most of the stories barable. I, however, absolutly despise She's Come Undone. I believe this is bound to be one of the least interesting books I have ever read. I reached a point in the book where the main character, Delores, was faced with many different problems and had many different options and I had no idea what to expect. In most books this would be a climax where I would not want to put the book down. But frankly I didn't care. I was not interested at all in what might happen throughout the rest of the book. I put the book down out of pure boredom. After I forced my self to finish the book my opinion did not change. She's Come Undone is about as interseting as watching paint that has already dried."
1,Hated it....,It went no where fast. Why are so many people crazy about a character that turns her life around only to become a stalker? Lame..... lame... and boring.
2,unrelatable...,"Although I think Wally Lamb can write, I found his voice as the female heroine unconvincing. This book came highly recommended from many people, but I just couldn't relate. If you are looking for an inspirational story about a resilient lady...I'd recommend looking else where."
1,This book is a very boring read!,"I was forced to read this book for my high school class novel. Some people thought this book was to be very entertaining. However, I found the book to be in poor taste. The events in Dolores' life are portrayed in a manner that causes the reader to feel sorry for Dolores. At times I did feel sorry for her, but during most of the novel I wasn't. I wanted her to take control of her life. She allows others to rule her life. I wouldn't suggest this book to people who don't like to read depressing novels."
1,A big non-event,"Despite the enormous hype over this book, it was, in my opinion, a huge bore! I did not find the lead character (Dolores) to be interesting or likeable. I found very little in this novel to relate to -- despite the fact that people kept telling me how effective Wally Lamb was writing in the ""women's voice"" for this novel. Sorry, Wally. When last I checked, I was a woman, and I found very little to relate to or of interest in this novel. Also, despite all of Dolores's life lessons, it was astounding to me to see how she continually made poor choices. I personally did not find this to be enjoyable or interesting reading. Just one big bore that I couldn't wait to put down. This is the 2nd selection from Oprah's book club that I have read. Strike two..."
1,sheer disappointment,"I loved ""I know this much is true"" by Wally Lamb. This book, however, was terrible. It was difficult to read such a depressing, frustrating account of someone who I could not relate to at all. In fact, I have about 50 pages left, and no motivation to finish. If you enjoy reading about someone's miserable existance, this book is for you."
1,She's Come Undone (Oprah's Book Club),"Do they teach the lessons of ""The Emperor's New Clothes"" anymore? This book was garbage."
5,my favorite book,"I absolutely love this book. I have read it at least 30 times and will probably pick it up again in a couple of months. The first time I read it I would occasionally be disappointed, because I would become so absorbed in Dolore's current world (teenager, college, marriage) and would be sad when one world would come to an abrubt end and another would begin. But I am not sure I can call that a flaw, because as soon as I read a couple pages of the next phase, I would find myself completely drawn in once again! Not many writers can cover such a long span of time and keep it so intriguing and interesting, but Wally Lamb does it amazingly. I would so strongly recommend this book to anyone, it is such a moving novel, very rarely have I felt emotions like this so strongly when reading a book."
2,"In Like a Lion, Out Like a...","At first, I was excited to get this book (in retrospect, it was all hype). I took it with me everywhere to read...on vacation, at the beach, etc. The setting was by the town I grew up in, so that was an added bonus. The story seemed to be leading somewhere so I kept turning the page, not able to close it.But, if you are a good writer, why waste the reader's time by making a terrible story? What was the point of this book? I felt like it was one big tickle that was leading up to a ""sneeze"" for pages and pages, only to reach a sniffle (or in Dolores' case, a ""burp"") at the end. I threw this book out with the recyclables. Even after that, I had a sort of ""residual depression"" for a month."
1,She's Come Undone by Wally Lamb,"This is the absolute worst book ever written, and I usually love reading pretty much any kind of book. It was actually painful to read. The main character just complains and makes life miserable for everyone around her until the very end. I hate saying that I dislike books, but this one was just not for me."
2,Unconvincing,"The main flaw of this book was that the author was unconvincing in his efforts to write from the standpoint of a woman. I was never able to forget that the author was a man (as I was with Roddy Doyle's ""The Woman Who Walked Into Doors""). The main character's language and thought process were dictinctly male in many instances. The plot was not credible. It almost seems that this book was a trial run for his later novel "" I Know This Much Is True,"" which is an amazing read."
5,Can you read while walking?,"I learned I could! Walking to my bus, catching the elevator; I could not put this book down. I got so caught up in Dolores and the way she stumbled through life. I pitied her, felt sorry for her, was disgusted with her, but constantly rooted for her. Wally Lamb does a pretty amazing job of capturing the ""she-thing"" and I could visualize each and every bizarre scenario poor Dolores was put in. You'll want to see if she pulls through, too"
2,"I couldn't put it down, but wished I could....","On a table of books recommended by Oprah, I found ""She's Come Undone."" I read the back and was immediately interested... a man who writes like a woman....hmmm....a coming of age story....sounds good! I began reading this book and couldn't put it down... waiting, wondering if this book would ever live up to my expectations... It didn't. I could tell it was a man who wrote it, and was greatly disappointed. I enjoy reading women's stories, not men who think they know women's stories... he was way off... I'm just frustrated that I wasted my time and money.."
3,A superficial coming-of-age and finding-yourself novel.,"While the end of this novel does get better, the first 2/3rds seems like it just talked. Maybe this is characteristic of mediocre novels...but I have been busy reading established ""classics"" and I felt that this book suffered in comparison. I would not read this author again, unless he writes about what he knows....and not the inner workings of a woman's mind. Dolores gains depth towards the end, but getting there was not easy to do"
5,A real page turner!,"When this book was recommended to me, I never believed that I could be so riveted to a story as I rapidly became to this one. What was most startling to me was that it was written by a man. I never would have believed that a man could put himself into a woman's shoes, so to speak, so completely, and capture every feeling and thought so perfectly. This was just not the story of a fat girl who loses weight (along with a lot of other things), but the story of the human spirit which, though sometimes bruised and battered, can ultimately triumph given half a chance. I loved this book and really hated to say goodbye to Dolores. I would sure love to run into her again!"
5,This is Living the Life You Were Given,"This book really touched me. It made me remember that we can only live the life we are given. In this book, Dolores Price is a young women who takes a lot of hits in life but keeps surviving. I really don't want to give away the whole book like other reviewers because you must experience the anger, the shock, the outrage, the sadness, the happiness, the anxiety, and the triumph without being forewarned. Some of the themes in this book include family, community, self esteem, love, acceptance, forgiveness, and friendship. You can't spend your life hating who you are and sacrificing yourself and your dignity to get others to accept you. It is hard to believe a man is behind the wonderful voice of Dolores Price, but Wally Lamb is very talented. Please pick this up, please read it, and please apply it to your life!"
5,"a journey through pain, love, and self-renewal","Welcome to Treetop Acres a place where it all began. Ten-year-old Dolores Price and her parents moved here in 1962. Inside their yellow ranch house, it wasn't so perfect as it seemed to be outside. Author Wally Lamb sends you on a journey through pain, love and self-renewal as a girl is born, and then born again. She's come undone is a witty comic of growing up in the sixties. Being part of Oprah's book club caught my eye but once I began reading I couldnt stop, this book is a must and a 10! This book is a wild story that seems so real. It is unbelievable that Wally Lamb, could capture a womans words and thoughts in such a perfect way. I definitely recommend this book. Everyone who reads this will join Dolares through her journey in life. You will never forget Dolares Price"
5,"Wonderfully written, touching beyond words","I found it hard to believe that a man could write so well in the voice of a teenage girl but he did and Wally Lamb really hit the nail on the head with this book. It was the first one of his that I read and it made me want to read more. Delores Price is the perfect protagonist - she's not perfect but just HUMAN and I think that's why so many people can identify with her. She wants to be accepted (don't we all?) and she looks for love in a lot of places she shouldn't. It is brilliant to see Delores come of age in this novel. I laughed, I cried, I got mad and in the end, I loved the novel and how it changed me."
2,Why was I so anxious to read this book?,"Since I live overseas as a military wife, I anxiously awaited the arrival of this book to our little bookstore.I now wonder why I felt that way. This book takes the reader on a depressing journey through the life of one of the most dysfunctional characters I've ever met! Abandoned by her father, neglected by a neurotic mother & grandmother, massive weight gain, virtually friendless; I could go on and on, but you get the idea! Yes, the writer does share a few entertaining moments and poignant memories; thankfully they were interspersed at just the right moments to keep this reader moderately interested."
4,"Excellent, if slightly exhausting","This is an emotional odyssey of a book, and a worthwhile read. However, you deserve to be forewarned: there are scenes in the book which are extremely painful, at times, even brutal. I loved Lamb's authentic characters, and cheered for Dolores, and yet the girl couldn't seem to catch a break in a novel that spanned decades. An enjoyable read that felt almost shockingly authentic and real, but I was ready to finish when I got to page 700+, and, to be honest, start on something a little less heavy."
5,One of my favorite's,"I love this book, and never wanted to put it down. It's been a little while since I read it, but would recommend it to anyone as it's that memorable! I can't imagine anyone not identifying with the main character - everyone has experienced alienation and has been strongly motivated to search for what is real and true. This is beautifully written and you go through so many emotions with the main character, you just can't help but get drawn in."
3,Hilarious? Funny? Not Quite!,"I bought this book based on the New York Times review which called it ""An ambitious, often stirring and hilarious book."" While I found the story gripping to read, I didn't find anything in it remotely funny. The characters in it are sad, angry, distraught, disgusting and often appalling. Don't expect to laugh unless you find human suffering, rape, child-molestation, self-destruction, abuse, obesity, adultery, unhappiness, AIDS, abortion, and death funny. The bottom line? Reader beware!!! If you want to laugh and relate to characters...try BRIDGET JONES'S DIARY, now THAT is a laugh out loud funny book!!!"
1,Just didn't get it.,"This was the first Oprah book I read, and I thought it was strange. I didn't find myself caring about the characters. I thought the plot was weird. I just didn't get it. Guess I need to find someone else to recommend reading material."
1,Does not live up to the hipe made about it,"This was my first book by Wally Lamb and I read it because it was in Oprah's book club..... I was totally unimpressed. The storyline was ... O.Kay but I dont think the the authour should attempt writing from a woman perspective, as he dosen't understand and thus Delores came across very shallow for the ""heroine"" of the book. I would not recommend this book for serious readers. It may be okay for readers who are interested in something ""light"". This book stimulated my mind as much as those cheap romance thrillers would. NOT AT ALL. Sorry Wally..... I hope that your other book on Oprahs list is better"
3,A True Journey,"I think this book was extremely well written and I did value the journey the main character goes through to realize her self-worth but I found it thoroughly depressing at times. Especially when she goes to college. I would have liked her to be validated by those who mistreated her (ie. her roomate). All in all, it was a good book but I can't say I really enjoyed it! I would have given it 3.5 stars rather than 3."
3,Solid but average book.,"This is a well-written book, but I didn't find much out of the ordinary in its storytelling. Characters and details are complete and believable, but the pop-psychology that is so prevalent and overdone these days plays throughout the book that it has become cliche. It's a solid book to read if you're looking for something to read over all the bad books out there, but it just ranks average."
4,The Best Book About Compulsive Eating I have Ever Read,"Delores Price was an all-consuming character. After reading this book, it took me a few days to untangle my own psyche from hers. As a survivor of an eating disorder, and as an eating disorder educator, I can honestly say that I have never read a more honest and sensitive story about compulsive eating. Although I thought the ending got a little ""Forrest Gumpy"" spaning the age of AIDS and all, I love Delores Price. She is strong, and she is righteous. She gives compulsive eaters hope, and a voice without apology or excuses."
2,Overwhelmingly depressing!!!,One sad slam after another - I was waiting and suffering through 400+ pages just to get a glimpse of some happiness in this poor young woman's life - none to be found! I regret spending a Club Med vacation reading this ugly story. Lamb is articulate and creative with words but don't read this unless you enjoy dwelling on life's negativity!
5,An Awesome Book for Teenage Girls,"This novel tells the story of Dolores, a young teenage girl who struggles with obesity. Dolores withstands so many hardships; deals with her low self esteem and triumphs in the end. She is such a relatable character, and Wally Lamb, a male, wrote from the female perspective perfectly. I flew through this novel."
4,"A courageous story, but it leaves something to be desired.","In all truth, I really did enjoy reading this book (I'll be honest -- I even cried a couple times while reading it). I liked the main character, and was engrossed by the paths she chose. I also respect the author for even attempting to address weight issues -- they are not easy to discuss, and everyone has a different take on them.However, it is disheartening to see a lovable character feel that she must (and in fact does) lose weight in order to be worthy of love and happiness. Of course there are women out there who are much happier when they lose weight, but I don't believe that to be the only path to self-determination, as Mr. Lamb represents in his book.But in the end, this is the story of just one fictional character and it is a masterful one at that. I recommend reading it because it is well-written and courageous. However, I strongly encourage everyone to also think about its implications once they've finished."
4,Dolores doesn't want you to like her...,"I tried to read this novel a year ago and wasn't able to. Probably because Dolores was (and is) too close for comfort. I just recently finished it. Lamb has created an antithetical protagnoist. She doesn't want anyone to like her. She doesn't want pity. I find it strange that so many readers think that's what her character craves. As for her life being a soap opera or unbelievable in its tide of negative events, there are similar lives walking around about all of us. Dolores Price is very real to me. She's not someone I'd point my finger at, but someone I'd see in a mirror."
4,Thou shall not judge!,"I found this book very intersting and enlightening. As a 25 year old woman who has experienced very little adversity in life and never battled a weight problem, occasionally I find myself quick to judge those women and men who are over weight. By the end of this book, although frustrated with her, I could understand Delores' need to ""comfort"" herself with food. We all use defense mechanisms to protect ourselves emotionally, unfortunately for many people those mechanisms have physical consequences. I suggest everyone read this book. It is a mind-opening adventure and will cause you to ""look in the mirror"" before judging others."
4,thoroughly enjoyable,"Lamb made the reader aware that every persons existance is separate and unique, even if they may live an existance parrallel to your own. Dolores rarely drew attention to herself, yet she lived the most morbid but fascinating life, stimulated by the extremeties of her family situation, her weight, and the strain of having to grow up in a stereotyped 'perfect' culture that she definately didn't belong in. Dolores represents how inner conflict and torment can have a drastic consequence on a person's physical being and their perception of themselves and the world in which they live. Never again will I presume a persons thoughts, history or hopes."
4,"Good to read, maybe not to buy","I was truly amazed at how intimately a male writer could express a female's point of view. Granted, I was a little disappointed that Dolores never ended up doing anything in her life, but I agonized with her every step of the way.This novel was recommended to me by a close friend, and it was worthwhile. It is a good novel to read and discuss with friends, but I don't see much else."
4,Uplifting and Tragic,"My mum made me read this book and I was completely absorbed from beginning to end. The story of Dolores Price is so incredibly tragic and depressing, yet like the scene of a car crash, it is morbidly fascinating and you cdon't want to tear your eyes away for a second in case you miss something. At time I felt like it was all over for the protagonist but make sure you PERSERVERE because it is worth it in the end.This book really supports the ""nurture"" argument for human nature and makes you think about how our pasts can shape us into the people we are today.This book will want to make you scream at times because you really believe that Dolores is a real person...you are made to watch her life unfold tragically but you can't do anything to help her.Don't give up on this book, the ending is worth it!"
2,If you have nothing nice to say....,"I will not go into a lengthy diatribe about why I did not enjoy this book. To do so would be to reveal all of the quirks it has and include a lot of spoilers for those who have not read it yet. What I will say is that this is one of those ""Oh come on, no one is going to believe that!"" kind of books. I found myself rolling my eyes, shaking my head and asking myself why I was even bothering. I got 2/3rds of the way through and realized these were moments of my life I was never going to get back. I moved on to another book."
3,`,"I enjoyed reading this book despite myself. It reminded me of all of the Judy Blume Books I read on vacation when I was 15. I felt a little guilty in letting myself engage in such a stupid book...but had fun reading it nonetheless. What is so scary are all the other readers who still think that a fine piece of literature is something like ""She's Come Undone"". What's with all of the 10's? Some of us seem to still be in a highschool time-warp! Do you remember ""Blubber?"" Same character, a little older, a lot meaner!"
4,Great book for a long trip,"I thought it amazing that a male author such as Lamb could capture so convincingly the voice of a troubled young girl and record it in a engrossing story of overcoming depression and self-depreciation to find some degree of stability in life. Here is the story of Dolores (a name which, appropriately here, means ""sorrow"") Price, a chubby young girl who grows into a more-than-chubby young woman who had endured every physical and emotional pain imaginable. You name it, it happened to her. Even a desperate search for happiness by stealing the former shadow of another person's life proves to be a failure. Dolores finds only one constant comfort in her life -- television. She's Come Undone chronicles forty-plus years of this interesting character's life and of the people she touches on the way.I bought this book for a four-hour plane trip and it held up well."
3,No pull at my heartstrings,"This is a psychological story of a young woman who overeats to compensate for her unhappiness. The book is well written, and the characterization of the young woman is excellent. However, I never felt the tug at my heartstrings or the emotional involvement which brings a book above the mundane for me."
2,"Reader from El Paso, TX","I had been wanting to read this book for a long time and I finally decided to get it from the library. After reading it I am glad that I did not buy it. It was so depressing through most of it. I wanted to scream but mostly I just wanted to finish it. I should have known, most of Oprah's books have not been worth my time. They are so overrated."
1,Could not relate at all!,"Wow! I thought I was the only person who thought this book was disgusting and depressing until I read some of the 735 reviews! I guess the only redeeming quality about this book is it really got people talking about it! I read it in a weekend - continually hoping that things were going to get better for this wretched woman (no way will I call her a heroine) and it only got worse. I was reluctant to even read it when I saw it was an ""Oprah"" pick and afterwards I kicked myself for going on with it. I'm a 32 year old young woman who lives an average, middle-class life and I have no empathy for this idiot woman who could never be optimistic or look at the bright side of life. The book is only fiction, yet what really bothers me are the real women who think this is a good book because they ""feel the pain"" of what boils down to massive SELF PITY!! It's so '90s! Wally, you have no clue - this is an insult to all young women."
3,"Interesting, depressing and annoying all at once","The reviews on the back of the book call it ""hilarious"" but I dunno where that came from considering the depressing tone of the book. Sure, there is some clever dialogue near the end of the book, but hardly hilarious. The only thing I found funny was the other review that compares it to ""The World According to Garp."" Hardly! I was impressed with the characterization of Dolores through her different stages of life though. It was very subtle and well done."
2,Lacks Originality,"I think I've figured out the formula for a best-seller that people can ""really relate"" to. 1. The main character must be overweight and angst-ridden. 2. A disfunctional family. The more problems, the better. 3. Rape or some sort of sexual abuse, preferably when the main character is still young. 4.Toss in a trip to a psychiatric institution. Voila-there you have it. If you haven't read any books of this sort before, try it. If you have read others like it, don't bother with this one."
5,a roller coaster of delicious literature,I literally laughed and cried for the characters here. Once again I marvel at Mr. Lamb's wordsmithing. I am enamored with his tough but tender approach to life and the stories he weaves feel absolutely absorbing. One of my favorite authors of all time.
5,Sleep Specialist Needed,"I spent two sleepless nights this weekend trying to put thisbook down. My friends tried to entice me away from the couch withpromises of handsome men and decadent hot fudge sundaes, but I could not get up. I was rooted to my seat, holding my yellow highlighter like a beacon, reading what seemed to be my life story and the story of all the women I know...though none of them are named Dolores. When I was finally able to close the cover and put the cap on my highlighter (I think all the ink is gone) my friends wanted to read the book that could tear me away from a weekend of fun. Unfortunately for them, they will have to buy their own copies because this one remains permanantly attached to my person, hanging around my neck just in case I need to read a specific passage. I have been known to snarl at anyone that tries to touch it, and heaven help the person that actually attempts to remove it. I wonder if I could have it outfitted with an alarm system....?"
5,"So, what's Dolores doing now?",Don't you find yourself asking that question if you've read this book? She's a touchable character that many can relate to. I really enjoyed this book--even ordered it for friends and my mom
2,Same Tired Topic,"Quite frankly, I am a little tired of stories about a woman's quest to find her ""true self."" I found this book on a sale table about two years ago. It was $2 (hardback!!). Though I finished the novel, I found it boring and filled with cliches. I learned from my experience with it that books on the sale table are usually there for a reason. When I recently saw it on the bestseller's list I was stunned. It's great that Oprah is encouraging thousands of people to read, but I hope that next time she picks a better book"
4,Well worth the effort,"I found this difficult to get into, but it was well worth the effort. It's a long way out of my mainstream reading. One thing I have to wonder about is how the mostly female characters appear to females? I'm male and to me Lamb does a great job of writing a book about women, but I have to wonder what women think on this question.Overall, I never found it a book I couldn't put down, but it wasn't that hard to pick up either and was definitely well worth the effort to finish. It's not a happy story, but it does have a happyish ending, which I think is just the way it should be."
2,okay,"this book isn't necassarily bad. It's fairly well written and is funny and insightful in places. While reading it i just felt like I had read it all before and did not really address anything new or interesting. The secondary characters seem to come and go so quickly it's hard to really get to know any of them. It gets a little tiring as Dolores makes bad decision after bad decision so she can finally ""triumph in the end"". Again it's not a bad book, it's just a little too stereotypical."
4,Triumphant heroine.,"Wally Lamb has written a book that is triumphant and profound. This book is about life seeking life. As the author clearly understands, sometimes the things that happen in our lives are so tremendously painful and confusing that not living develops an appeal that's irrational but undeniable. I myself have faced the paralysis that accompanies being afraid to live. And like Dolores, overeating and its sense and sanity-numbing effects became my crutch. Wally Lamb's exploration of the dysfunction that such dissassociation from life creates in Dolores reveals and teaches an uncommon compassion. With tremendous finesse, he tells his well-crafted character's story without oversympathizing with or condemning her. This is a difficult book -- but promises inspiration to anyone who understands the struggle of pushing through darkness to the call of the light. If you open your heart to Dolores, you won't be able to resist a sense of gratitude for life's complexity by this book's conclusion"
4,So you think your life has been a little on the tuff side..,"Have you ever felt like an outcast? If yes, you will have no trouble relating to ""Delores"". Though she is a charater that is sometimes easy to dislike the more you read the more you grow to feel pity, not only for her but for the majority of charaters. After reading this book you'll feel...like... well.... maybe I dont have it so bad after all"
4,A charming and uplifting read.,"I absolutely loved this book! Dolores Price is a wonderful character, destroyed by the breakup of her parents marriage--carried along by the whirls and eddies of the changing social mores of the 50's, 60's and 70's. Dolores is my contemporary and part of my enthusiasm for this book is due to the loving portrayal of a young woman growing up in the 50's and 60's. I emphasized with her pain, her loneliness, her awkwardness. However, from page one I knew that Dolores was a survivor. No matter how bad things got for Dolores, I just KNEW that somehow she was going to get through and make it. Thank you Wally Lamb for this lovely story of a survivor---I do not know how a man could so totally tap into the psyche of an adolescent female. But, Mr. Lamb, you hit the nail right on the head! Thank you"
3,ummmm...,I don't know exactly what to say about this one. I like Mr. Lamb's writing style...he definetly kept me reading. The character seemed very extreme and a little unrealistic in her escapades. I thought it was cool overall though.
4,Finally!,"Exactly what I wanted. Have been looking for this book for about 5 years now. Thanks for making it so easy to find and purchase! And so cheap, too. :)"
4,a great read,"I really enjoyed the book cove to cover, there were no dull sections, very well written, and the story itself was really touching."
2,Hours Undone,"Though it was well written, there was not a character within this book to care about. I found the ""heroine"" to be a pathetic wimp who wasted years of her life trying to get over her self pity. Sure, she has plenty to feel sorry about, but much of it she brought on herself! I appreciate that the author (a man) can sympathize with the plight of women (girls), but he overdoes it here, leaving his protaganist a spineless, self-destructive, unreasonable recluse. I tried to care, but wound up disliking this character more and more.Kudos must be given for delving into women's issues such as self-destructive eating habits and low self-esteem. Unfortunately, the process is both frustrating and predictable."
1,One of the most depressing books I have ever read!,I couldn't force myself to finish the book. I got about 3/4 of the way. I kept skipping ahead to see if anything positive or uplifting ever happened to this woman. I don't understand why some people raved about this!
2,He's Come Undone,"As one of Mr. Lamb's former students in his early days of teaching, I just couldn't wait to read his debut novel. It was a book that was as cliche and nostalgic as he was as a teacher. It read like one of his lessons in creative writing, using poetry and song as a backdrop for setting, plot, outcome. All very cute, somewhat juvenile and sophomoric. Please, Mr. Lamb, don't try out your female voice on us again, male perspective cannot be masked. Sometimes you were as unfeeling as Dolores, how could you not be sensitive to the plight of a young person in trouble? Mental illness should never be made humorous."
1,False advertising,"This was an airport purchase,based on the jacket notes stating it was ""comical...hilarious...a heroine to cheer for"". I waded through this absolutely dreadful book over the next several days out of sheer determination to find the redeeming qualities. There were none. There is not one single positive quality in the heroine, any other characters, or the book itself. If you're not already clinically depressed, this book may help you get there. It reeks."
2,Soap opera and nothing more,"This book proved disappointing to me. It reeks more of primetime soap opera than any serious, searching literary effort. The props are all there - the father who ups and leaves, the mother who cracks up, the childhood rape by a neighbour, being a social outcast, an unhappy first marriage etc. There is no believable turning point in the novel, only a requisite happy ending tacked on four-fifths of the way through.Dolores as a character was difficult to sympathise with; she didn't become real for me. Her reasons for eating so much never became clear; how she lost that *amazing* amount of weight eventually didn't either.Ultimately, I think the reason why this falls short is because it's all melodrama and no insight. It brings nothing to light for the reader; I learnt nothing, discovered no new truth, did not stop to wonder at any turn of phrase or beautiful description."
2,What a disappointment,"I was looking forward to reading a good, insightful novel last summer when I picked up this highly recommended (by Oprah at least) book. It's not that this book isn't written well - because it is. It's just that this book never seemed to say anything significant about life or love or struggle or anything that one would expect from the first 100 or so pages of the book. I don't recommend this to you, because I think there are so many beautiful books out there that aren't necessarily more happy than this book, but are definitely more meaningful. I felt like I wasted my time and energy, and I gained nothing!"
5,Couldn't put it down,I was surprised at Wally Lamb's ability to tell a story from the view of a girl growing into a woman so well. I really enjoyed this book as well as the author's writing style.
4,Would love to meet the author,"I constantly reminded my self that the author was a man! At first, Dolores Price really bothered me because I really wanted her to take the initiative and make some positive changes in her life. I guess I am someone that judges overweight people, the ones that Dolores had to deal with. It opened my eyes as to how judgemental I can be. I ended up cheering Dolores on and ""falling in love"" with her. Awesome book."
5,A book that is real life,"I found this book to really deal with everyday real life situations. There was no glamour, or great loves. It is a book about growing up in the real world. I enjoyed it and would recommend it everyone."
3,a stagnant story of the life of a girl. hard to relate to,"Her life is not a happy one, but at least she found some happiness at last. I don't like it much and think it's a waste of my time reading it."
2,Is Oprah crazy?,"I bought this book based on Oprah's recommendation and I was completely disappointed. This book failed on so many levels. First of all, the in-depth narration of Dolores' childhood was not necessary. I know this sets the tone and it gives the reader the background of the character but I immediately took a disliking to the protagonist of the story. As an author Lamb did a poor of job getting me to sympathize with this young woman named Dolores. Second, with all the attention given to the character's childhood and adolescence, the recovery period was minute and not as thorough as it should have been. This should have been the most significant aspect of the book. I do love Dolores' transformation at the end of the book. That was the most powerful section. Overall, the book was a disappointment."
4,This book was excellent,"I recently read this book for a school assignment, never having heard of it before. I wasn't sure how much I would really enjoy it. Once reading the book, I couldn't stop. I ate throught it. I couldn't believe how honest and frank it was. Some sections were somewhat unappealing, however, I found myself relating to Dolores. I have none of the problems she did, yet, because it was such a powerful story, I felt as if I were Dolores! I definately recommend this book to a mature reader. It is refreshing to see how well a man understands a woman and her feelings. I would love to meet the author!"
3,"Not the Greatest, but Good","I did enjoy the book very much, it is a ""page-turner"" type of book but not the greatest. Many parts of the book are very graphic and discomforting but besides that, it was good reading."
2,A very confused character!!!!,"Unfortunately, I really couldn't grasp what Dolores was going through emotionally. Dolores was a person who dwelled too much on her unhappiness and draged her past with her whenever she had a chance of happiness. She treated those who wanted to help her like crap and I really couldn't understand it. I really can't relate with what She's been through, but I think this book just dragged on her unhappy life, her mental sickness, and her search for what she couldn't have. In one word, her character was a real witch!!!"
4,"Love it or hate it, you'll finish it!","It seems to me the opinions of this book are of one extreme or the other. While I truly enjoyed the novel, I disliked most aspects of Delores' character. She's repellant in many ways, and with good reason. In any case, the story is affecting. Else, why such strong opinions? It draws you in and you want to see what may come next. Dolores is not the first heroine with a questionable morality. I think it is she that is hated, not the story."
3,hmmmm....interesting but not brilliant,"I enjoyed the book and felt some empathy with Dolores.However for such an angry person I felt we only experienced that through some of her actions and never really through her own feelings. I wanted to know how SHE felt inside--not just the ends to it i.e. when she killed the fish.Her outward anger was only the manifestation of that emotion, I was interested in the feelings she experienced leading up to those actions or inactions."
5,"Buy it, Read it, Love it","I'm 14, and this book is the best I've ever read. And I LOVE to read. I want to love her and hate her at the same time. This book, you will never forget. Trust me."
4,Wonderful,"At first, I thought the book was kind of...disturbing, but then it grew to be a beautiful well-written novel. You will eventually fall in love with Dolores and pity her and even try to convince her mentally that she needs to wake up and pick herself up. Great read, this one. :)"
5,She's come undone alright,"This book, written by a male author from the female point of view, is nothing short of brilliant. Dolores Price is a young girl that everyone can relate to in some way, even though life hasn't been the same to everyone. The book is cleverly written with humor, sadness, honesty and candor. Dolores is a complex young woman who you are routing for every time she's knocked under water. Made of sandpaper on one side and silk on the other, Dolores is a myriad of emotions. To quote Elton John, she can best be described as 'A Candle in the Wind'. The best part of all there is evolution! Read, enjoy and love life!"
3,Depressing,Everything bad that could possibly happen to this girl does and I felt absolutely depressed after I finished reading it.
3,Hilarious? Funny? Not quite!,"I bought this book based on the New York Times review which called it ""An ambitious, often stirring and hilarious book."" While I found the story gripping to read, I didn't find anything in it remotely funny. The characters in it are sad, angry, distraught, disgusting and often appalling. Don't expect to laugh unless you find human suffering, rape, child-molestation, self-destruction, abuse, obesity, adultery, unhappiness, AIDS, abortion, and death, funny. The bottom line? Reader beware!!! If you want to laugh and relate to characters...try BRIDGET JONES'S DIARY, now THAT is a laugh out loud funny book!!!"
2,What's the big fuss?,"I was very disappointed. My niece recommended it to me and since we have similar tastes in a lot of things, I thought I would enjoy it. Perhaps it was all the hype. But Dolores was so angry at everyone and all the time. Until the last 20 or so pages of the book, she never matured beyond the angry 12-year old. I didn't like her and wasn't surprised that few people did."
4,Wish it never ended!,I thought this book was amazing. It was conclusive and captivating. I recommend this book to anyone who can be swept away into someone's life as they struggle to obtain themselves. Simply amazing.
4,This from a man?,"If Wally Lamb's picture wasn't on the book, I would never believe it was written by a man! What an amazing book! Lamb's take on the travails of a fat, abused, semi-crazy female will blow you away!"
2,Hard to get through,"While I think Wally Lamb is a great writer, I also think he tends to overwrite, and in turn his books are much longer than they need to be. I had difficulty getting through this book and that doesn't happen to me a lot. The book grabbed me in the beginning, however it didn't take long for me to lose interest. The story was predictable, and the main character made me start hating her less than half way through the story. It's hard to empathize with someone so hateful, and with really no redeeming qualities at all. I understand self-loathing and personal conflict, but Dolores took this to a new high. I want to like the protagonists in the stories I read, and in this one, I just couldn't."
4,Great Book,"Great book, ordered it on my Kindle Touch but had to hook my Kindle up to my computer, log onto my Amazon account and transfer the file over. A Kindle issue, not an Amazon issue."
4,"Good read, but why all the smut?","I found this book very interesting. Unless you've suffered from depression, one can't totally grasp why Delores acts and thinks such as she does. However, I am very disappointed that Wally Lamb had to bombard this book with appalling language and page by page description of sex. Not everyone enjoys such graphic talk, and for me, it took away from my enjoyment of the book."
2,A book about being a victim of your environment.,"I gave this book a 3 only because I was interested enough to finish it. The book epitomizes the current thinking in our society today : We are a victim of our past - because we could not control what happened to us, we cannot control where we will go, and who we will be. I kept waiting for Dolores to realize that the future truly is in her own hands, and she can chose to live whatever life she wants. Unfortunately, I'm not sure she ever really figured it out. The popularity of the book makes me think that a surprising number of people haven't figured it out either."
1,Just One More Doughnut!,"Well, after all the hype I finally read this book. I gave it one star because Lamb is a good writer, but this is one of the most maudlin, self-pitying, annoying characters that has ever been created in the history of literature. I just wanted to reach into the pages and poke Delores in the eye. Hateful, an animal abuser, mother and grandmother abuser and ultimately a self-abuser. Aside from the unfortunate rape incident, all of her misery was chosen, not inflicted. If there was one point of perfection in this book is that it was perfectly disgusting in the graphic details. One more mentioning of doughnut consumption and I was likely to hurl. Delores deserved her misery, however, I did not. The fact that other reviewers here can use words like ""inspiring"" and ""uplifting"" is ludicrous. Just goes to show you how easily Oprah can market this meaningless drivel as literature."
3,She's Come Undone - Kindle version,The Kindle version of this book had a distracting number of typographical errors. I've never encountered this problem with Kindle books!
5,Excellent book - I couldn't put it down!,I'll make this review short and sweet.It was one of the best books I have ever read and I've read hundreds of books over my years. This held my interest so much that I had a problem putting it down every night and often found myself thinking about the character throughout my day. Excellent book and very well written. I wish there were more authors out ther that could write books like this. You will not be dissapointed with this one by any means.
4,Heartbreaking,"Liked this book a lot and wish he would write a sequel to it. It was sad, humorous, and a lot more wrapped up into a pretty fast read."
1,She's Come Undone,"I forced myself to trudge through this book just because I was determined to finish it. I was so disappointed and depressed at the end, I felt I had wasted far too much of my precious time.If one enjoys reading about never-ending misfortune, unnecessary and unforeseen trouble, excessive pain, self loathing and extreme negativity then this is your kind of book. Although this book delineates humor, I found nothing funny about it.I grew up in a very dysfunctional family and could have taken the path of Dolores (protagonist); there were many similarities in our lives. However, I chose not to destroy myself and could not relate to her.I feel Lamb is an excellent writer, but this book is thoroughly disgusting. What a waste of talent! I had no sympathy or empathy for Dolores. I give it one star only because I must.Ruth Hirsch"
4,A journey to healing and acceptance,"I read half of this book one night i couldn't sleep, and i decided not to read it fully. It was just too depressing. But then a month later, i was sick and bedridden, and i picked it up again, and finished it that day. I am glad i did.The first half of the book describes the trauma which Dolores, the heroine will spend the rest of the book to overcome. Don't expect that afterwards all will be ""and they lived happily ever after"". It is more close to reality than some fairy tale story: ""and they learned to live with the reality"" is a more appropriate ending.The biggest surprise in reading this book, is that is written by a man, from a female's perspective and Mr Lamb did a good job in my opinion. It is the journey of a female to healing and acceptance. Worth a read."
4,"FUNNY, TRAGIC, IMPOSSIBLE TO PUT DOWN","This was a captivating book, narrated by a depressed, drastically overweight teenage girl named Dolores Price. The tale is so realistically and hilariously feminine that it's very hard to believe a man wrote the thing. I was so thoroughly caught up in this girl's story, and was truly rooting for her to claw her way to a happy ending. Funny, tragic, impossible to put down, and, as with all books that make my ""best-loved"" list, an ending of much-deserved grace."
4,Dolores is incredible,"A friend of mine recommended this book to me before I even knew it was on Oprah's book club list.Dolores is an absolutely remarkable character. Wally Lamb is a remarkable writer who has an extraordinary gift with character development. Once I started reading this book, I could not put it down.It is interesting to read about a character who becomes enlightened before the reader's eyes. Dolores deals with so many trials and tribulations that it is hard to believe that she survived to be an adult.For anyone who wants a good book to read, this is the book. Dolores will touch your heart."
5,This book makes you FEEL!,"Until ""She's Come Undone"", I have never read a book that takes you inside the character's mind to make you laugh, feel sorrow, pity, excitement, anticipation.. The author's ability to do this is what compelled me to read this book in less than 4 days! I think everyone can relate to a part of Delores' life, either the triumphs or the tribulations! I am amazed that this book was written by a man. It is the first book that I have read that I actually caught myself laughing out loud and reading lines to my husband. I love Wally Lamb's writing style and can't wait to read his next novel! I'm sure you will find yourself passing this book on to friends and family for their enjoyment. A definite must read!"
2,"A ""Must Not Read"" for the already depressed","My aunt recommended this book, praising Wally Lamb for being able to write from a woman's point of view. I personally could not relate to Delores or the way she thought of herself or the world around her. Even though she goes through a lot, I did not find myself caring about this character. The romantic relationship she had with Dante was too pat. I couldn't buy his falling for her so soon (or at all.) If Delores had had an ounce of personality and I had words to describe her other than fat, mean, and crude, I could've believed that Dante could fall in love with her. I was disappointed in this book. Looks like Oprah can't always pick them. If you want a good read about someone whose life is pitiful and how they handle it, read ""Angela's Ashes"" by Frank McCourt (nonfiction.) I picked it out myself, and the only regret I have is that the book ended."
2,More depressing even than real life...,"While I don't feel my life has been anyone's bed of roses, I found ""She's Come Undone"" to be so depressing and gritty that it was literally unbelievable. While many instances, taken alone, were shocking and thought-provoking, the book as a whole was just too much. Sorry, Oprah, and others... it's obvious many disagree, but I found the book a waste of time."
4,Perverted but Interensting,"This book is very graphic in detail. The main character, which is a young woman named Dolores, is put through a major ordeal. She has very bad childhood experiances, being raped which was more traumatizing to her than any other, and getting overweight. I highly recommend this book. I also advice you to get some sleep the night before you start reading it because you won't be able to put it down."
3,I too came undone,"This book did something to me. I, being slightly overweight, found myself feeling hostile toward people in public. After I finished this book I cried for a long time, still not sure why. I guess it touched me somehow."
5,ALL YOU'LL WANT TO DO IS TURN TO NEXT THE PAGE.,THIS BOOK FAR EXCEEDED MY EXPECTATIONS. DOLORES IS A YOUNG WOMEN WHO SEEMED TO WANT MORE THEN ANYTHING TO BE ACCEPTED INTO A WORLD THAT HAS A PRECONCEIVED IDEA OF WHO SOMEONE SHOULD BE. WITH THAT SHE ACHIEVES MORE BY THE END OF THE BOOK THEN YOU EVER THOUGHT SHE COULD CONSIDERING WHAT SHE WENT THROUGH.
5,"Awesome Author, Plot, Character","I love the way Wally Lamb writes and the plot of his novel. The reader will pity, love, hate, boo, and cheer for Delores at different times- and sometimes at the same time!- throughout the novel. I have found a new favorite author and I really recommend this book to any modern fiction lover. A+++++++++++++++"
3,Conflicted about this one,"While I believe that Wally Lamb has a fascinating gift for women's literature and a unique understanding of the female psyche, I do not really care for this book. The story did come to life for me and Lamb's vivid writing spoke to me on so many levels, but the tale itself was hard to swallow. I did not respect the protagonist and, as such, felt like I was punishing myself by reading her story. I found that I disliked her more with each line I read. Dolores has experience alot of mistreatment in her life and that is an explanation for her actions, but that doesn't compensate for my adverse reaction to her. Instead of sympathizing for her, I despised her. However, Lamb does tell a tale unlike any I have encountered before and he tells it with a magic no one else could muster. That's the only reason my rating is not merely one star."
5,reader from New York,"I think this is one of the most moving and compelling books I have ever read. As a person who has expereinced much of the things Dolores does in the book, I totally disagree with other reviews estimation that it is cliche and only interesting to the unknowledgable. I have given it as a gift to several freinds (all of whom have loved it) and read it several times myself. I highly recommend reading this book."
2,"sensationalistic, at best.","A decent story, but overly sensationalistic. I would like to see bestselling fiction stand more on well crafted writing & good story telling and less on terror-out-to-grab-you events."
4,Couldn't Put It Down!,"This book was really good. I bought it Friday afternoon and finished it Saturday nite! I got so into it, that Delores' bad attitudes affected me! I would read huge portions of the book and then walk around in a bad mood, because of the ""Stuff"" going on with Delores! It was weird! I really enjoyed this one!"
5,An excellent book and a wonderful new author!,This was truly one of the best books I have read. I found myself unable to put it down. It is a very entertaining book and I wanted to continue to learn more and more about the character.
3,I came undone,"Unfortunately, I am able to relate to Dolores on many levels. Infact, I could have been her, though I hope I wasn't as unlikable as Dolores. She is so bitter and manipulative it is hard to be happy for her when she finally confronts death and welcomes love. I felt more for Dante, her self absorbed, cheating husband, than I did Dolores. But despite my opinions regarding Delores, I enjoyed the book. The story is well conceived - the characters real."
2,My expectations were too high and therefore unmet.,"This was the first of the Oprah's Book Club titles that I chose to read. The story had the potential for greatness, but the story teller dropped the ball. Depressing and lacking that ""can't put it down feeling."" I read long novels in a matter of hours, I am glad that this one was short and took little of my time. ON to bigger and better tales!"
5,I gobble it up,"interesting how some areas of the country's reviews thought it was bad, and other areas thought it was great. It Was GREAT. The characters are deliciously drawn and wonderfully engaging. Dolores is rude, outrageous, disgusting, loving, heartbreakingly wonderful. Good music. One of my favorite reads. I want to read more Wally Lamb."
3,"Entertaining and easy to read, but not challenging.","I enjoyed reading this book, as it doesn't require any great effort to digest. It does, however, seem to become tedious in that Dolores Price can't overcome her character faults, no matter how much you want her to. Save your money for Wally's other book -- it is much better!!"
3,"Difficult to read, but worth the effort.","This is a sad story about the life of a young girl and the trials and challenges put before her. There are many traumatic events that occur during this young girls life. These various scenarios alone makes it difficult to read. However, there are some true jems of wisdom within the pages that make the reading (although difficult) well worth the effort."
4,hard to put down,I enjoyed reading this book during the summer and I am looking forward to reading Mr. Lamb's next novel. I have passed this book on to friends that I think will like the adult content of this book.
3,Good but not excellent,"I enjoyed reading She's Come Undone but not like I thought I would. Wally Lamb certainly captured a woman's perspective and did an excellent job at drawing the characters. What I didn't find in this book is the desire to keep reading it. I enjoyed other books in the Oprah Club much more (particularly Stones From the River, Ellen Foster, A Virtuous Woman, and Song of Solomon)."
4,pretty different,"a great story but there are some very REVEALING parts that I think a lot of people might not accept... I however, loved the book... totally different than most quick reads!"
5,Wally Lamb is a brilliant writer,"I will echo what many have said before me - there's no way a man wrote this book, I mean why would he even want to??? It's an amazing journey into the heart and mind of a tormented female soul. You laugh out loud and feel like crying while you read it. At times I was downright angry and felt haunted when I put it down. I wish it had ended a bit differently, but all in all I would call this book absolutely stellar. I'm already on to his much longer tome, ""This Much I Know is True."" I can tell it's going to be even better. I've never been so captivated by a writer's style."
4,Life to the nth degree,"She's Come Undone was a great read. I devoured this story on a crosss country flight, too enthralled to consider braving the airplane bathroom. That a male could write in this woman's persona is nothing short of amazing. For months, I avoided reading She's Come Undone, because I didn't want to endure a tale about a woman's battle against obesity. I was pleasantly surprised to find the story was life, only exaggerated by an order of magnitude. Any American female will be touched by the truth in this tale."
2,Oh Please!!!! The Dumbing down of America continues,"Although I read this book without putting it down, it was only because I was waiting for something insightful to occur. The lack of insight and depth of the characters in this book is incredible. I have witnessed first hand disfunctional family issues (including a suicide) and have personnally been in therapy. The superficiality of this book's handling of these issues is astounding. After 20 years of working in corporate America and taking an early retirement, this book has reminded me of why, when I first viewed daytime TV after all those years I felt like I had just entered a ""stupidity warp"". Knowing this book was recommended by Oprah reinforces my impressions of current daytime television and the pervasive superficiality of many of our societies views regarding relationships. WAKE UP AMERICA!"
3,Average,"This book came highly recommended by a friend, but after reading it I was wondering what all the fuss was all about. I would not recommend it. It started well but it lost its juice before middle of the book. Getting to the end of the book became a chore"
1,Hated It!,"I was expecting this book to be fantastic--the reviews had been great, the story sounded touching, and even the cover was cool. Once I started it, I kept waiting and waiting for it to become interesting. It didn't. This book was a cover-to-cover yawn-a-thon. It was nothing like an Anne Tyler novel. The protagonist was annoying and unsympathetic, the secondary characters were lifeless, and the only thing I learned at the end of it was that I need to curb my instinct to buy books reviewed by Oprah. Thumbs-down"
2,"Disappointed by ""She's come undone""","While Lamb's story was interesting, I was expecting a mature story of coming-of age, instead I found the material to be more offensive and disturbing. I feel Lambs need to include graphic language, lesbian experiences and the strecthed grasp of female masturbation a sad, dark novel that left me very un-inspired."
5,"A book about life and its regular rhythms, both good and bad","I couldn't put this book down. Dolores, the maincharacter disgusted me and movedme as she dealt with an unkind life. Froma sweet, happy-childlife cheated child toan unlovable, demanding fat girl andfinally to a scarred but mostly healed woman, Dolores' journey was fascinating.Wally Lamb didn't glamorize life or love. He didn'tturn the unlikable characters intoone-dimensional bad guys. They arecomplex, rich people.The message I got is life is complicated yetordinary in that like Dolores, we all suffer fromneurosis, doubts and fears. Dolores' life inthe end becomes mostly peaceful andhappy because she accepts herself, faultsand all, and lets herself be loved.It was a very sweet book."
5,Interesting!Evi,"Interesting! Very unusual book, especially due to the fact that it is authored by a male. His understanding of the female heroine is spectacular."
4,She's Come Undone by Wally Lamb,"This book was great! I enjoyed it from the beginning to the end. The author kept you wanting to turn the next page. Most of all, I couldn't believe the author was a male. I kept checking the front of the book just to make sure. He captivated every emotion a woman could possibly go through. Talk about a male being in touch with his feminine side. I would recommend She's Come Undone to all of my friends as it was also inspiring."
2,This was not my favorite for sure!,"This book intrigued me when I read the cover, but I was disappointed. I think the descriptive techniques are excellent, but the book is very dark and long. It did not keep my interest consistently. I read a lot of books which are deep and deal with similar issues, but there has to be some transitions, some comic relief, or a way to grip every now and then. By halfway through the book, I felt like this book was just continuing down the same sad path. Just not my style. Maybe if it was condensed a little it would flow better."
5,Great Story!,When I finish a book in a week than you know it's great! I couldn't put this down for a minute (except when I had to work). The story Lamb tells is outstanding and he's a man. The story of Dolores is funny and heartbreaking all at once. I actually found myself giggling out loud at some of the things Dolores would say. I highly recommend this book.
3,It Was OK,"I wanted to read this book when I first saw it on my library's bookshelf. That was before it got so popular. After hearing about all the reveiws I thought it would be even better then I expected it to be. Maybe I wasn't in the mood for reading this type of book, but it didn't really charm me as much as I had expected. I enjoyed it somewhat, but it was one of the best books I have ever read like I thought it was going to be. It was full of Dolores talking about her depressing life and all her trials and tribulations, but in the end she conquers all. The part that made me chuckle was when she was in Burger King with Dante and she finally told all of her secrets."
5,Yay!,"Ok, I'm not going to summarize the book, because so many other people have already done that. I'll just say ""read this book"". You'll thank me for it."
1,Awful,"I'm not sure who Wally Lamb thinks he is. Writing from a woman's point of view and being a man is an interseting idea, but he doesn't execute it. The characters were typical and boring and the plot dull. As if I didn't know she was going to end up with the man of her dreams. Next time Wally, ""write what you know."""
1,The author is uncomfortable writing in the voice of a woman.,"Wally Lamb is a mystery to me. I found his writing in the voice of a woman to be forced and unnatural. As for his story, I was unable to work up sympathy for his much maligned protagonist. This story has none of the rich texture of a Pat Conroy novel, whom I felt Wally Lamb was trying to emulate. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone."
2,Made me sick to my stomach.,"What a tragic story to read. You feel impelled to keep going even when you forget why. A book about nothing working out. Definitly not upbeat reading. If you are feeling depressed about weight issues, it might make you feel worse."
2,Very Depressing,"I am in the middle of this book and am not really sure if I will be able to finish it. I have become so depressed reading about this girl's life. She causes her own problems and blames others. I can't relate to her in any way. This is not a good story. I do have to say that it is written very well though. I am almost engaged by the writing alone. It's too bad the story is so awful. Mr. Lamb, please write something uplifting in the future. I would definitely buy that!"
1,PATHETIC! This book made me angry!,"After reading this book I was SO angry I considered writing a letter to Mr. Lamb. He OBVIOUSLY has some unresolved issues regarding overweight, chunky...FAT women. This poor young woman had myriad problems, the least of which was her weight. To lump all of these problems into one symbol (her size) and then to harp on the problems that resulted from her unattractiveness (due, of course to her weight) was an insult to the millions of beautiful, well adjusted, overweight women everywhere. Shame on Oprah...Shame on Mr. Lamb."
1,Save your money.,"Yes, I am one of the masses who read this book based on Oprah's recommendation. I think this book is the literary equivalent of ""People"" magazine. I recognize that this novel attempts to touch on the many issues facing women, but I found Lamb's manipulation of Dolores Price to be patronizing and false. If I am going to read trash, I would rather it not be packaged as pseudo-literature."
1,I want those hours of my life back!,"Rarely have I finished a book and regretted ever picking it up to begin with. This book is so horribly depressing, I'm amazed the national suicide rate didn't go up after it was published. Under normal circumstances, I have no problem with depressing literature. It usually has some sort of literary or moral value, and as I read, I kept waiting for that to be the case with this book. It never came. I picked up this book because a friend told me what an amazing writer Lamb is, and how he writes women like no one else, not even a woman. I couldn't disagree more. Neither I nor any other woman I know thinks like Dolores. Usually, when I read a book, I can retain something of value from the experience. This is the only book I have ever read where I honestly wish I had never even opened the cover."
2,"Powerful, but Miserable","The only positive thing I can say about this book is that Wally Lamb definitely paints a picture. Unfortunately, the picture he paints is one of depression, angst and dysfunction. The publisher should provide complimentary prozac with every purchase. It was the most depressing piece of writing I've ever read. I kept thinking that this girl's life couldn't possibly get any worse, but was wrong time and time again. The heroine is utterly stomped on, beaten and tossed about by life in ways that one couldn't possibly imagine. A tiny glimmer of hope in the end was not enough of a reward for enduring the misery of this poor woman's life. It was too deep, disturbing and depressing for my liking."
1,I must be the only one...,"...but I hated this book. The main character was unlikeable, mean, self centered then she goes through some strange transformation (that happens when she loses weight, hmmmm) and becomes endearing, considerate and altruistic."
3,Good but not great,"I have been debating whether or not to read this book for some time now. I found it in a used book store for 5 bucks so I decided to give it a try. I have mixed feelings about this book. On one hand, it's very interesting- a story of an obese girl learning to come into herself and the world and on the other hand it's quite depressing. Throughout most of the story, I couldn't stand Dolores. She was mean, rude and I could not relate to her at all. But once she started to come into herself, I learned to lighten up a bit. I wouldn't say I liked her by the end of the story, but I didn't hate her either. This book is worth reading, I only gave it 3 stars because it's very intense and very depressing. It's also pretty long so it takes a good chunk of time to read, it's a quick read but still you have to be willing to sit back for some time and read the story of this girls depressing life."
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"If you want to read about almost everything bad that can happen to a person, pick up this one. Another one of Oprah's books which is totally unrealistic. Lamb is a good author, and the book is easy to read. It's too bad the content stinks. He could have had Dolores turn her life around and show how people can overcome obstacles. Instead, she was typical of our society and played the victim. Oprah, please pick a book that really challenges people's minds--if you want to ""change people's lives"" DON'T have any more of these dribble books on your book club! Pick one that has a main character that has redeeming qualities."
4,"Interesting, amusing, and ultimately a great read","Well, I always enjoy especially reading the ""bad"" reviews on here before writing anything myself. It always serves to amuse me.Be that as it may, I have to preface my comments by saying that anyone, male or female, who buys a book only because some woman on television says to really has no right to complain. Come on, folks, use your brain--Oprah's a talk show host, not a literary mind.And finally, I don't care who writes a book, man, woman, whatever, as long as what's written is true and believable, which this was.ANYWAY, I loved this book; thought it was just simply wonderful, especially the end. I think it has a lot to say about the nature of love and the struggle of life. The only note that rang slightly false with me was the characterization of Dante--I kept wondering how he moved from a sensitive, prospective Lutheran minister to the dolt he became."
1,insufferable,"I forced myself through the first 100 pages of this book before giving up. Lamb does get inside this adolescent's head with an eerie emotional accuracy, but I never felt like he really empathized with the character. I was always a few steps outside of her, looking in. It felt creepy. (Unlike the view of the protagonist in Bastard Out Of Carolina or The Bluest Eye.) And one of the more brutal episodes was so predictable, I found myself dreading it as I read. I don't recommend it."
2,anything but funny,"After literally years of not reading a novel because I just didn't have time, I wanted a good read.I picked this book up on an impulse, never having heard of Wally Lamb.Throughout the misery of this book with a thoroughly unlikeable heroine, I kept thinking how strange it was that a woman (assuming Wally Lamb was female) would write something like this - neither I nor any woman I know would have thought, reacted or felt this way.Well - once I finished (and the ending is LAME, to say the least!), the last page revealed that Wally Lamb is a middle-aged man with a family, which at least explained that part.It was well written, if clichéd and predictable, but sickeningly graphic in parts. As for funny - unless you revel in seeing people heading for disaster and being jerks, I don't really see what's funny about it all."
1,This is the absolute worst book I have ever read!,"I could not believe this book was on the Oprah book list! This is the first book I read from the Oprah list, and it will be my last! I had to finish the book to see if there was a ""normal ending"", but of course it was just as bad! It gave me awful nightmares! Delores should haver killed herself at the beginning of the book so I wouldn't have wasted my time finishing it!"
3,God help poor Dolores!,"This is one of the most disturbing books that I have ever read.Is this truly the way that abused people,women in particular,return again and again to the same kind of abuse which was their undoing?Can one's own personality be totally submerged in the kind of ""comfort"" --stuffing your face with food to the bursting point,baking your brain with hour after hour of t.v.--any tv,and returning to the same kind of sexual dominance,just for the sake of having a man--any man? God help any poor female who lives this kind of life style! At times,I felt the greatest sympathy for Dolores and at others,I would have liked to shake her till her teeth rattled! I also find it difficult to believe that this book was written by a male(without a massive amount of input from women)"
3,Not For Everyone......,"This was the most DEPRESSING books I have ever read from beginning to end.I was however drawn into the book and wanted to see if things would improve for Dolores. However they dont, it goes from bad, to worse, to can't this girl get a break. The New York Times claims that this book is hilarious. You will find that in Dolores' scarcasm, but by the middle of the book you will feel so sorry for her you will not even find that funny anymore. While there is never a dull moment in this book, it is not for everyone. It is especially not for those looking for an uplifting story."
3,An anti-hero so unattractive that you tire of being with her.,"I commend Lamb for writing about a troubled and obese young woman who was raped as a child. He presents Dolores in a compassionate and honest light, but even the most patient of readers will tire of this unique anti-hero and her self-defeating ways."
4,"She's Not ""Undone""","She's come into her own. It takes the whole book to get there, but Dolores makes it in her own sweet time.Mr. Lamb has an amazing way of knowing what's in a young girl's head. He touches on a woman's feelings like he has inside information, my hat is off to him in that regard.Dolores has a smart mouth and tends to blame others for her shortcomings. Her mother sticks by her anyway and does come through the story as a loving, though struggling parent. Both Dolores' Mom and Grandmother are strong women who only want the best for Dolores, no matter how she treats them or more importantly, herself.This is a true ""coming of age"" story about a woman who not only ""comes undone"", but also pulls herself together to become a good person who cares not only about herself, but also her family and friends."
2,Like being at the scene of a bad accident...,you want to look away but you just can't. Watching Dolores methodically make incredibly bad choices time after time set my teeth on edge. If she had done only one of the many stupid things that she did in this book I might have been able to stomach it. I Know This Much is True is much better!
1,The book's undone!,"Wally Lamb may not have grown up in this time frame, but this is a poor attempt to capture the era. This book seemed overly peppered with 90's language (constant F-Y, F'n this or that) and not in tune with the late 60's/early 70's (nothing groovy or nifty about this one). I made myself finish it only because I started it with a group. Don't waste your time or money on this one."
2,Not worth your time,"I waited and waited for the good part to come, after getting about 1/2 way through I realized there was no good part. After a while I just wanted her to kill herself and get it over with. This book drags on and on. It doesn't even really have an ending. It just ends. I don't recommend this book. I you want to read a beautifully written book that you can't put down, read White Oleander. Skip this one."
4,Great but Long Read for Women,This book is about a young girl who constantly faces challenges while growing up - since her baby brother strangled himself with the cord to reaching a weight of 297 pounds.This book is appropriate for women in their early 20's and over. These women must have free time to hang on to every detail.
5,You laugh or you cry,"Tough, sweet words. Thank you. I was simply abused. It takes a dark, sweet moment when the din of th party is loud. The child is small and quiet is surrounding the ears of the child. The man is not really scary but, familiar. The party grows lowder ......."
1,Disgusting,"I read this book about a year ago, and I'm still disgusted when I even think about it! How could Oprah recommend this book! I haven't read anymore of her ""book club"" suggestions after wasting my time on this one. The whole reading experience was just plain embarrassing. This one ended up in the trash.....Yuk!"
1,She's Come Undone,"I was very disappointed with this book. It may be a male writing about a females experiences, but after forcing myself to complete the book I wonder what was the point of the novel, and why was it recommended by Oprah's Book Club."
3,She's come undone,"I enjoyed this book and I agree with others that Wally Lamb is a very good writer that writes women very well. The book is funny at times and interesting enough to keep the story moving along but it is a bit simple, nothing too deep, a quick, fun read."
4,Wally Lamb is surely a woman,"Anoher hugely popular novel that i read with my book club ages ago. At first, I could not believe that the author was a man. In my opinion, he captured a woman's psyche perfectly. Many details of this novel have stayed with me through the years: her first husband's sexual exploits, her grandmother's surprise at how soft an afro was (!!!), the pistachio adventures, the Etch-a-Sketch art... I may want to reread this again, as I flip through the book."
2,She's Come Undone,"The only thing funny about this book is the description on the cover that says it is hilarious. It was tragic and I never laughed once. The story should have ended half way through when it was believable. I felt like more stories and drama were added just to add more pages to the book. They could have been stories on their own. The symbolism of the whale and freedom and fatness is not orginal. I do however, take my hat off to the fact that a man could write this. He did see a woman's pt of view."
2,Do I love it? Hate it? Want to throw it in a Dumpster?,"I, along with plenty of other readers, give this book mixed reviews because it's painful to read and a little disgusting (poor Delores...raped at 13, taunted to death, obese, lesbian, mom dies, placed in mental institution, divorced, emotional pain..yikes!!) I wouldn't read it again...don't read ""She's Come Undone"" if you like lighthearted comedies."
1,The most depressing book of all time!,"I truly disliked this book. It was not funny but pathetic. This girl needed help in a BIG WAY! I find most of the books that ""Oprah"" likes to be this way. Pass on this one. But if you give Mr. Lamb a second chance you will find ""I Know This Much is True"" to be a book of a different sort"
1,No Star!,"When this book is not simply boring it is downright depressing. If you like to wallow in misery go for it, but I think most of us have had enough misery in our lives without suffering someone else's vicariously."
2,Half unintelligible,I watched the beginning of the first episode on PBS and found it annoying in general. Most of the heavy regional and class accents used (for 'atmosphere' I suppose) were only partly intelligible and this added to the fact that it is far from the best work of Dickens caused me to turn it off and go to bed. BBC productions of Dickens don't have to be only partly intelligible to US audiences as the Martin Chuzzlewit and David Copperfield adaptions make clear. It depends upon the actors and the direction I would think. PS I went to university in the UK (two years at Cambridge) so I am not an American unfamiliar with the UK or English speech. Of course at Cambridge most English was the Queen's English which presents no problems to Americans.
1,This is not Dickens - I don't know what it is,"Where to start??? The acting is poor, the casting is absurd, the dialogue is bland, and inaccuracies abound. This is not Dickens' great novel, but a soap opera loosely (very loosely) based on the novel. Just for starters, Miss Haversham is advertising for a boy even before Magwitch (the convict) is apprehended. The whole point of the novel is that Pip is selected for Great Expectations because of his kindness to Magwitch. He is destined for Estella, Magwitch's daughter, yet this all seems to be already in place. The sequence of events just does not compute. Did the director even read the novel? I will be going back to David Lean's superb 1946 versionGreat Expectations (The Criterion Collection)just to get the bad taste of this production out of my mouth."
5,Great Expectations is a good story!,If you like Masterpiece Classics you will love this. PBS never disappoints. It was delivered as promised and for a good price.!
4,A fair portrayal...,"I had the pleasure of stumbling across this book in the most unlikely of places, a Target, just days after finishing the book. I was pretty excited as I've enjoyed other PBS productions in the past and I was looking forward to the mini-series, hoping it would do the book justice.Watching this film I did notice how the director and writers strayed from the story here and there. I don't know if I would have noticed this not having read the book just days before. Maybe I've grown used to modern directors taking liberties with the story, however. I did enjoy this version of Great Expectations, though. I suggest that those who have never read the book might like it as well as those who read the book but aren't fastidious about the details. If you're like me and like to have multiple versions of the same movie (yes, I do that...), then this is still something you should at least check out, if not add to your collection."
2,"Shallow Characters, wooden main actor performance","This story is rushed and boring as presented. There is little to no character development, zero humor and little explanation.The younger main character is great but the adult actor (douglas booth) has a wooden face that does not express emotion. No connection with any character in this version.Compared to delights like Little Dorrit (2008) and Bleak House - this barely scratches the surface of what dickens adaptions can be.In short - this was disappointing to watch as the acting by the main model-looks booth seemed off and not easy to identify with characters/storylines."
5,My dog loves it,"We have a boxer, and he loves pushing and punching this ball around the backyard. Great way of burning off some of that energy. The ball is well constructed. No way he'll ever be able to destroy this one!"
1,This 14-inch Purple Jolly Ball is terrible,"This ball is too large, very hard and dangerous to have in my house or outside. I can see an injury waiting to happen. I am throwing this in the trash before someone gets hurt. My big rotweiller at first was excited to play with it, but soon found out to huge to get her mouth on it and play ball. If I threw this ball for her to catch, she would get injured. This ball can be a weapon"
1,definitely not intersste,thought my labs would like the ball but they have barely given it a glance let alone play with it
4,GSD is entertained for hours,"My GSD is going on jolly ball #3. Ball #2 broke this last week when he figured out how to get it outside in sub-zero temperatures and the ball cracked. This is how ball #1 broke as well. I will be buying ball #3 this spring when the weather is warming and after the yard dries out as he will come in all covered in mud. My GSD loves to herd the ball around in the yard, to the point that when he stops he puts his head on the ball. This is a great from of exercise for any herding dog."
2,"Durable, but Heavy, maybe a tooth breaker?","This ball is durable enough to not suffer punctures from my mini-Australian Shepherd who loves to herd a big ball. I ordered this one because it's hard plastic. That's the good news and bad news. It's pretty heavy for a 25 lb dog to push around. She's learning, but it's frustrating, so she jumps and bites at it. I asked someone who trains herding dogs about that and she said she had two dogs that broke teeth on these; one of those dogs broke a jaw. :( I'm going to see if I can get my pooch to push this around from underneath rather than trying to nip at it. I am now looking, again, for this size of a herding ball that won't be easily punctured by her sharp little teeth and won't break them either."
5,Every dog should have a built-in playmate!,"This ball is a must for active dogs of all ages. The 10-inch is perfect for approx. 50 lb. dogs. My lab puppy and my 12 year old boxer/lab each have one and they are infatuated! I had to get the puppy a separate one because the 12 year old was so possessive-she has played self-soccer and hung outdoors and licked the ball enough for 10 years that she definitely owns it. As soon as a human approaches the ball, she still engages in a competitive 1 on 1, fun soccer"" game""...good exercise, but remind your human friends how HARD and durable the ball is before they kick it and hurt themselves! The ball simply lasts forever- chew proof and weather proof! We filled the puppy's ball with water (optional) because she's stronger and kept pushing the ball over the electric fence boundary, but the 12-year old ""noses"" her empty ball around all day, never letting it go ""out of bounds!"
4,Great Jolly Pet Toy,"This really only gets played with with our other outdoor Jolly Pet toys are not out, so it is the least favorite. But it stands up well to the pawing and chasing."
2,Play ball,The ball it's self is fine but it is heavier then I expected. Because of it's weight it is not a light push and my puppy lost interest in it fast. I was going to return it but the shipping charges and possible restock fee were almost as much as the ball.
5,Love it!,"I bought this for my mini bull terrier who destroys oversized tennis balls in twenty minutes. He hasn't stopped playing with his Jolly Ball since I unpacked it. He pushes it all around the lawn, through the garden, round the trees. He can easily control its path by changing sides and can get some speed up. So far he hasn't managed to even damage the ball (the garden is a different story!). The cost of importing it into New Zealand was well worth it."
5,Great for large/herding breeds,"My GSD LOVES this ball. It's made from a hard plastic, not the same material used in the original Jolly Ball with a handle, and it's meant to be pushed along the ground, not thrown or picked up. She pushes it with her front feet, then chases it, cuts it off, and pushes it again in another direction, barking gleefully all the while. She never gets bored with it, and eventually I have to pick it up and put it away because she'll chase it until she drops if given the chance.It's also hollow and has a plug to let you put sand or water in to change the weight and the way it rolls, but I haven't tried filling it with anything yet."
3,Not So Jolly for Pit Bulls,"Bought several of these balls in different colors for a coon dog and a pit bull. Product stands up well to the coon dog, but gave up the ghost after less than 15 minutes of attention from the pit. He managed to get a tooth into the mold mark and opened up half the ball. If you have a heavy chewer, this is not the product for you. Try an ""Almost Indestructible Ball."""
2,beware toes and shins,"Though indestructible, which we needed with our 40 lb. puppy, this ball is too heavy. We hurt our toes/shins if we try to play with it with the dog, and the dog avoids it, because is just too heavy to stop without getting hurt. It is solid, hard plastic."
2,Play Squash a Dog,"Bought this for a mini-Schnauzer who can open his jaws hugely wide and pop even 30"" playground balls.But this is too heavy for him. He CAN roll it around, but kicking it for him to chase is a sure broken toe, and throwing it invites him to run UNDER it before it lands, and it is heavy enough to squash dog flat.Doggone.Buy this only if you have a very, very large dog, or, better yet, a playful horse."
1,Hard plastic,"My two labs love their Jolly Tug and so I got this thinking it would be the same thing, only without the handle. I was disappointed to find that it's just a hard plastic ball and not the softer (but still very durable) material that the Jolly tug uses"
1,Marilyn,Ball is so so so heavy -- it's like metal. My dog could not punch it with her nose and it sounds awful when it supposedly bounces. Not good.
3,Questionable,I received this ball today and it is not round! It wobbles when rolled & is side heavy. The ultimate test will be when I give it to the dog to play with. Somewhat discouraged with item but the dog will give the final answer whether I return it or not. The larger ball I ordered with this does not have this problem. Hmmm defect? or planned??
2,hard plastic,"this is a big ball for my 12 lb schnoodle. Too big I think. It's like a hard plastic material so, no bounce and he's not able to grab it also because of the size. I tried just rolling it to him to get him to play with it, but, it just rolled loudly and he just stared at it. I don't think he ever plays with it."
3,Endless entertainment but with a negative side,"Length:: 0:36 MinsWe have a border collie/heeler mix and she absolutely goes nuts over this ball. I gave the ball to Mollie a couple of months ago (bought it earlier for our other dogs and they showed no interest) and it seems pretty much indestructible. The downside is that it is very hard on the dog's teeth/face/anything that encounters the ball, including my toes, another dog in the same yard, etc. She can really moves fast with this ball when she wants to! We have also lost several sprinkler heads, some landscaping and outdoor lighting to the rampaging ball. So I'm going to try Varsity Ball (smaller but softer) and see how that goes."
5,GOOD BALL,"This product is a repeat purchase, its a play ball for our dog, it is made of very strong/sturdy material an ideal toy for our English Bull Terrier."
3,Mixed Review,"Our dog LOVES this ball. We really don't have any complaints with the construction of the ball...but be careful if you have a dog like ours. We have an American Bulldog who loves toys, but also loves to destroy them. There is a plug at the top of the ball to fill it with water, sand, etc. and it's recessed so that the dogs can't pull the plug. But our dog likes to hook his bottom teeth into the recessed part and then use his top teeth to try and bite it. It has left a ring of teeth marks all the way around the top of the ball. Two concerns: 1) it's hard on his teeth and 2) the teeth marks leave little bits of sharp plastic that then rub on his nose/face when he's rolling it around.He usually only does this when he gets tired of rolling it and chasing it so we try to stop him before it happens (he only plays with it while supervised)"
4,"Truly interactive, confounding dog toy","I have a large lab mix (82.5#) and he loves balls. Anything rubber or plastic, he eats up. So, I've gotten to really enjoy these Jolly brand hard plastic items ~ he adores their teaser ball and has the best time with it with or without human involvement (check it out). This ball he must play with on his own because it is hard for humans to pick up and throw since it is so large and he cannot pick it up (thus the name push-n-play) and it would be great if he didn't keep rolling it out of our property boundaries where he then stands and barks for it! (we have an e-fence)When he keeps it in bounds, he pushes and plays for hours of fun. and, he cannot destroy it! YEAH!"
3,this ball is HARD,"I bought this ball for my Australian Cattle dog/bull dog mix. She is an extremely aggressive chewer and has destroyed every 'indestructible' toy I've bought for her- until now. This 14"" ball is made of hard plastic, it cannot be pierced by dog teeth or paws. It is hard and heavy, and may be a bit much for dogs that aren't really tough. There is a screw-in plug so that you can put water or gravel inside to make the ball roll erratically."
4,Push n Play Ball,Our German Shepherd loves this toy. To improve it I would not have the cap you can open to fill with water or sand. He fixates on that spot and can tear the ball open and get his mouth caught which is why we have to order new ones. He cannot do this with the opposite end of the ball.
2,Too rough,The ball has a hole in it near the top which has shard edges. The seam around the ball is also enough to cut your dog's nose after about 30 minutes of play time. There needs to be a soft padding around it.
5,red jolly ball,"the jolly ball is a great success! the dogs love it and can't destroy it! they are 2 american bulldogs. they run around like crazy, pushing it all around the yard"
1,Leaks!,"I think my dog would love the ball. Unfortunately, when it arrived, it was clearly not what I had hoped for. The seam, where the two halves of the ball come together, had multiple leaks...some so large I could see inside! How could this get past quality control? Overall the ball is solid because of the thickness of the material, but I cannot put water/sand in it at all because it immediately leaks out through the holes. Very, very displeased."
2,Guaranteed DEstructible,"After less than a week, we had to take this toy away from the dog. Here's the problem.Our dog loved his small (10-inch) jolly ball and tried to play soccer with it. He also kept trying to pick it up, and it got very scratched and rough. We thought that buying a larger one would solve that problem. He can't get his mouth around it, it's true; but there is a problem. The larger sizes have a removable plug so that you can fill the ball with water. The plug is in a recessed ""hole"" in the ball -- which gives the dog a place to bite on. His teeth made deep gashes in the ""indestructible"" plastic. The rough edges then scratched his nose to the point of bleeding. I do not see any large versions of this ball without the plug. So, if your dog is at all inclined to use his mouth, this toy is NOT a good choice."
2,Better Toys Out There,"Made of hard plastic so it's very noisy when rolling around and into things. My dog never took a liking to it. He pawed at it a few times and now it just sits in the room, lonely, waiting for a chance at redemption.I think the hard plastic lacks the ""fun"" while the magnitude ensures that they can't get their mouths around it. Not being a dog, I can't be positive, but I assume that ""squish"" and ""ability to fit in mouth"" are two relatively high priorities in the dog world and this lacks in both."
5,Great item. Durable.,Great item. Perfect for herding/working dogs such as red or blue heelers or rottweilers. Durable. Priced appropriately.
3,"14"" push-n-play","My dogs play with this ball, but because they can't carry it don't like it as well as a smaller ball."
2,indestructable...not!,"We bought the small version of this ball for our German Shepherd when she was a puppy...she eventually punctured the plastic and would get her tooth stuck in it. We bought the larger one...our other GSD had a similar ball that was much harder and could never destroy...but even the larger size was no match for the canine teeth of this GSD. It is now SHREDDED! Unfortunatley, the shards can and have been swallowed...luckily the dog vomited them soon after. She LOVES it! We love that she loves it...but it is just too dangerous for a dog that can get her teeth into the plastic. sadness...."
1,NO HANDLE,"For those of you that purchase play balls for your horses. This is not soft and does not have a handle. My horses did not like it as they don't play soccer. Got confused with ""The Jolly ball"" I normally buy."
1,Ball is too hard,"This ball basically just sits in my yard now. When I bought it, I was thinking it was similar to a ""ball pit"" ball in thickness, but it is much thicker. My dog wants to play with it, but when she runs at it, I am afraid she is going to hurt herself. This might be a good toy for an elephant, but not a dog."
1,Worthless & Pointless,"Hi I'm Max, a part Belgian Malinois & part German Shephard. I weight about 50lbs & love to play with big toys. I even have an old basket ball I love to play with. I don't know how I can possibly be expected to play with a toy I can't hold in my mouth or chew on. If my owner knew this was made of plastic he never would have bought it. He thought that when it said ""Push"" it said ""Plush"". Who has ever heard of us playing with a ""PUSH"" toy. What are we supposed to do with a ""PUSH"" toy. Am I supposed to play soccer or something??? That would be a helluva trick. Then I could be on David Letterman. Don't buy this for a dog. It would make a good baby toy maybe. It is baby safe unless they throw it. Maybe they can ""PUSH"" it though."
2,It's a start,Most of the sites had new addresses which made this book a hindrance for this newbie. I could have searched using trial and error and not invested so much time looking for one address.
2,"Content fine, WEB site information needs updating",While using this as a source of WEB information I found it easy to use and informative. As an always updated and current source the authors do not achieve their stated goal. Great for beginning information = Part one. Great for a starting place for sites. Needs to be updated to deal with the ongoing changes on all given sites as well as new sites which were not even available when printed. As it stands its worth half the price. I paid way to much at Barnes and Noble. Should have waited the three days and received it from Amazon! DEG
5,Duuuu,"What's to say, but Great!How can I say this 20 more times as required. But super-great, greatest, most entertaining, great performances. Done now!"
5,PERFECTION,I had 14 DVDS of QUEEN/Freddie & My Ex decided to keep them ALL..So now I'm rebuilding and this is one of my FAVS besides Wembley..Freddie is beyond the most incredible Performer there ever was!! (Even have a tat with his name and birth/passing date) From His Solos To all Of QUEEN I'm NEVER disappointed in any of their stuff..I've got every CD they have out and slowley I'll have All the DVD's again!
2,THIS IS NOT QUEEN,"There is no QUEEN without Freddie Mercury. NO OTHER singer is/was and most likely ever be as great FREDDIE. He can never, NEVER be replaced. Plus John Decon isn't with band that's NOT QUEEN. I miss QUEEN and will always love their music, it has been the soundtrack to my life. But Paul Rogers? get the f*** out. I gave it 2 stars because Brian May is one of the best ever but they disrepecet the band that was QUEEN by not calling themself something like ""QUEEN TRIBUTE BAND"""
3,Mabis not right,"I am very satisfied with the large readout and the automatic inflating cuff that this unit has. I've had no problems with the size of the cuff as others have experienced.I have had a problem with ambient temperature reading about 4-5 higher than my indoor thermometer reads. Also, after having my blood pressure checked in my doctor's office, I used the Mabis and got a reading of 76 distolic compared with the 62 the nurse got. I have, on occasion, had the cuff inflate a second time without my prompting it to do so resulting in a atypical reading. I will be sending the unit back to the manufacturer to fix these problems."
1,Photo Copied/Same book different name,"I was furious when I received this book because I thought it was a 2nd book written by his mother. However, this book is word for word the exact same book as Bob Marley: An Intimate Portrait by His Mother, just with another name. Also, it looked like a cheap photo copy of the other book. Especially the pictures. I wanted my money back."
5,Qinxin Heart Music,I am very pleased with this product. Thankyou for your prompt and efficient service !
2,would not recomend,I'm afraid this product just did not work for my wheelchair. It was quite unstable and did not hold my drink in an upright position.
2,DIDN'T work for me =(,My hubby's powerchair didn't allow this to work properly on his chair. I ended up finding something else that did work for us.
4,I think I'd rate it four stars... if it had not arrived broken...,"I ordered this item from reseller AntOnline for Christmas for the kid. Item arrived broken. Within 10 mins of signing for the box I called AntOnline to rectify the situation, but calls were not accepted. So I sent an email which included pictures of the cracks. They answered *once* via email that UPS would be handling the issue. So I had then to schedule an inspection from UPS. Missed the person, so sent pictures to them. Contacted AntOnline who did not react. Called Amazon who told me to be patient. Finally called Amex, blocked payment, and now, more than a month later, I have a half-opened box under my desk and no resolution. Very bad experience with AntOnline (and Amazon).Because the Thrustmaster was not in stock with Amazon I ended up buying the GT25 from Logitech, and we (note: WE) have not regretted this for a second. Who knew force feedback could make such a big difference?!?"
2,You get what you pay for,"I do not have this wheel, but another Thrustmaster racing wheel. I believe its the Ferrari 2-in-1 racing wheel. I've had it for about 4 months, and not really any problems. Until a few days ago, when one of the paddle shifters just completely stopped working.I've contacted their tech support 3 times, once via email twice over the phone. When I talked to them, they acted like they would do something to fix it, send parts, RMA or something. But nothing so far. It's been about 5 days since I first contacted them about the problem. Also every time I call their tech support agents always try to get me off the phone in 5 mins or less. I'm going to KEEP calling them until the actually do something about it.I also have a Thrustmaster Joystick, that is actually pretty nice. So if you have a little more green do yourself a favor avoid the headache and get a logitech. I wish I did."
1,Thrustmaster Rally GT Force Feedback Pro Clutch Edition Wheel,Having been a die hard thrustmaster user for the past 6 years I must say this wheel/pedal set was very exciting announcement. Well the excitement was short lived.The forcefeedback motor belt was so tight the wheel couldnt recenter itself. After totaly rebuilding the wheel it improved slightly. Yet the Forcefeedback wasnt nearly as impressive as my old NASCAR pro unit.The pedals where the highlight of the whole deal and while constructed very well and with decent pieces there was no way to adjust the resistance ont he pedals so the brake and gas and clutch feel all the same.
2,Worked great... until it broke,"I had so much fun with this wheel. It worked awesome, especially in games that allowed you to do things like slip the clutch. Everything felt perfect. Well then one day the downshift paddle broke. This is a real bummer, since that is a very important control. The wheel is also starting to wobble. If you want to risk it, it is a great wheel, but mine is slowly deteriorating."
2,Thrustmaster Dissapointment,"Sure it was easy to use, it's a damn steering wheel. I just am super disappointed that none of the games I had could utilize the full capability of this wheel and after playing almost all the way through NFS Most Wanted it started slipping internally and the wheel became loose and feels like it'll pop off. Just too bad and it is on its way to the trash can if I can't figure out a way to stop the internals from slipping. I wouldn't recommend this wheel no matter how cool it looks and or sounds."
2,Di'dn't work with my game and I want to take it back!,It didn't work with my game and I want to take it back. I called the manufacter and they said that they had no any idea how could helping me.
1,Junk,"I had an wheel like this and the shift paddle broke. Tried to return it and had nothing but trouble from Thrustmaster (they never did give me authorization to return it). Steering wheel has a lot of delay and is flimsy, it really is hard to use. I use it with GR-R, GT-R2, it really is not worth the effort. I would look for something different."
5,Awesome printer!,"I bought this like 7 or 8 months ago and I could not be happier about it! its an awesome little color laser MFC:even though HP stopped producing them, I see you can still get them on the internet for a very reasonable price!interface for pc and mac is easy to use.the printer itself is very easy to maintain.....and the network port is definitely one of the most welcomed feature on thisI really dont have any complain about it!"
