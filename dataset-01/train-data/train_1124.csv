3,Leo & Kate,"I was uncertain of what this movie would be, only having heard bits and pieces. Individually, both Kate and Leo were incredible, and made you believe they were the characters they portrayed...sad, unfulfilled, absent in the existence of their lives. Together, there was undeniable chemistry between the two of them!The movie itself made you feel like you were waiting for the next thing to happen, as if it needed to be better, bigger than what was going on.I thought it was merely ok. Glad I saw it, glad I own it because of the actors performances, but at a lack of words to describe exactly what this movie is...adequate? disappointing? missing something? sad?"
5,A film that stays with you,"I never thought I would like this film,about a married couple in the 1950's but for some reason it gets to you.This married couple's living the American life,the nice house,2 kids,and a good job,but want more,and almost make there dream come true,but something happens that should have been a blessing.The acting is fantastic.Kate Winslet and Dicaprio are 2 of the greatest working actors today.I would love to see them in a comedy next.""Revolutionary Road"" is a movie you still think about after its over."
2,Revolutionary Road,I don't know about the movie but I hope it's better then the Audiobook. The book was all over the place with the characters. It was very hard to keep up with the story.Hope the movie is much better.
2,too dark too depressing,"The actors and actress did a wonderful job however, the content was dark and depressing. Frankly, I felt miserable after watching this movie."
2,american beauty part 2,"I saw this film because I had just sen The Reader which was brilliant and wanted more of Kate Winslet (her acting I hasten to add). The plot never materialised. After 1 hour I felt I was watching De Caprio self-indulging. I was expecting some plot, twist to happen but it never did. I couldn't wait for the end to come round quick enough. Then I heard that ominous piano music which reminded me of American Beauty ( another couple trapped in a loveless marriage); likewise her suicide at the end was reminiscent of Amerciab beauty. Sorry but the film just dragged on and on and on. Acting wise, Kate was great, but I just wanted to watch a movie and enjoy it."
3,This movie is a talking point for safe abortion,"You will have turned away by now if you don't believe in safe abortion and I a rarely outspoken, but here is one case. The overall arching themes of this film are the repression of the 50s and early 60s and in the end, there is the unsafe abortion the mc does for herself which does not go so well. I really did not care for the rest of this film, but it gave me a moment to talk to my teens about abortion. I know it has gone on for hundreds of thousands of years weather you like that or not, it is history. If my children or friends they know are contemplating this, please let medicine be involved!!I did not like the rest of the movie though I like the actors. I found it to be too cliche.Love to youJJ"
1,"More depressing than ""Promises in the Dark""!","Two hours of my life I can never get back! That's how I felt after watching this depressing movie. I was going to see it in the theater but never got around to it. A friend of mine rented it and I watched it with her. I haven't seen a movie this depressing since ""American Beauty"" and ""Promises in the Dark"". Aren't movies supposed to be an escape from reality? Don't waste your time or money on this one!"
1,A MISERABLE DOWNER OF A FILM,"This is probably one of those instances where the book was better than the movie. And maybe one of those instances where the book could/should not have been made into a movie. I suffered through the whole mess. There was not one character in the film that I felt sympathy toward. They all deserved to be miserable. Was this film produced by a cigarette company?I've never seen so many cigarettes smoked. Even films made back in the 50's didn't have so many cigarettes lit up. My lungs were starting to hurt at one point - I was thinking "" if he/she lights up another one, I'm going to start coughing"". I could almost smell smoke in the room. Wow!I never got the tone of the piece, either. At one point, in the middle of all the depressing misery, I thought maybe this was a some type of dark comedy.What a waste of top notch talent. A forgettable film. Leaves a bad taste.Yuk."
1,Worst Dicaprio Movie ever!,"Revolutionary RoadUsually you can depend on a DiCaprio movie to be Good, but this was really bad.Wow, I didn't expect to set anyone off. I only wanted to save others from wasting their time viewing this Bad Movie.If you enjoy downer movies about people fighting and cheating, by all means watch this one."
4,Crazy Dude Steals the Show,I really enjoyed this movie. I liked the story and the atmosphere of 1950's culture. Leo and Kate were excellent as were the rest of the cast. The crazy guy from 'Bug' (with Ashley Judd) steals the entire show playing the crazy son of Kathy Bates. He is hilarious! Good movie.
3,"Leo and Kate, Again","It's a long way from Titanic, when these two starred as lovers. Here, they're married in the American suburb, supposedly with the ""American Dream"" of nice home, good job, two children. I didn't see the family dog, however.This movie was a disapointment. Adultery, mental illness, and suicide is not my idea of movie enjoyment. This may be the way some screenwriters perceive family life today, but it was not my way. I watched it all the way through because I wanted to see how it ended. But I didn't like the end!My opinion? Don't waste your money.G. Gupton - ""The 31-Day Diet of Spiritual Enlightenment"" and ""Seekers of Truth"""
2,Their acting hasn't improved much since Titanic,"Kate Winselt and Leondaro DiCaprio, that same duo that brought youTitanic, now star inRevolutionary Road [Blu-ray], a very different film. This movie isn't really a lighthearted love story, which is what I expected based uponTitanic. Rather,Revolutionary Roadattempts to show the struggles of a young couple seeking to break out of the traditional mold of 1950s suburbia. The premise of the movie was interesting, but it's a very dark movie and not a great date movie (my date fell asleep). Furthermore, Winselt and DiCaprio just weren't the actors to carry this out. DiCaprio is very stiff and can't get beyond being boyish, despite being 34 years old. Winselt is way too dramatic and overacts. At the end of the movie, I felt little personal connection or sympathy for either character. This movie might appeal to some audiences, but it was entirely forgettable for me."
2,"Two Stars, one for each actor","This is a horrible movie. It's funny how people rate this movie based on their affection for Kate & Leo from the Titanic. This is not the Titanic. This is a foolish movie that never moves along, nothing happens until the last 15 minutes. It's one of the slowest most shallow movies you will watch, there is no depth in this movie. If your in love with Kate & Leo well you will watch this movie just because but if you are not, you are wasting 2 hours to watch this movie there is no redeeming value. I don't post very often, I don't review movies but I had to vent on this one. All the hype is sad, this movie sucked."
2,Will Sampson movie?,"Found this when looking for his movies. Don't believe he was in this one! Never wanted to see this one when it came out, and don't think i'll be buying it!"
3,Really Depressing,"I normally like Leonardo DiCaprio movies, but I don't like this one. It's about a couple living in suburban Connecticut. They are moving up in the world. They are taking some major risks in order to achieve their dreams. Things don't work out the way they expected. This movie is acted out very well. The thing I don't like is the story. Kate Winslet's character is extremely emotionally disturbed. She attempts suicide multiple times and successfully gives herself an abortion in the bathroom with a vacuum cleaner. That kinda stuff is really hard to watch. So unless you want to feel emotionally wrecked, avoid this movie. I dislike this movie, but to be totally fair I'm giving it 3 stars because of the amazing production quality, script, and acting."
3,DiCaprio Channels Nicholson,"A good movie with an interesting story and two very talented actors. I had forgotten that Sam Mendes directed two movies I enjoyed, previously: Road to Perdition and Away We Go. I found American Beauty too disturbing. I am continuously impressed with the roles Kate Winslet selects. They are always challenging and often unglamorous. I admire her as an actor. Leonardo DiCaprio is always impressive, as well, but his impersonation of Jack Nicholson in this move felt extremely artificial. I found it very off putting. His role in previously-filmed The Departed must have had a lasting affect on Mr. L. Di."
5,Titanic: Part 2,"This movie, to me at least, is what would have happened had Jack not drowned in the end. This movie is tragic. This movie will probably even make you cry. This movie will make you thankful that Jack died at the end of Titanic."
2,Revolutionary Road,"A decade after Titanic, Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet again find themselves playing characters on a sinking ship; however, in Revolutionary Road the vessel is their marriage. The movie is handsomely crafted by Sam Mendes, but the result is an exquisite downer. DiCaprio and Winslet star as Frank and April, a young couple with dreams of ditching their humdrum suburban existence for the freedom and excitement of Paris; however, circumstance stymies them, and resentment follows. Revolutionary Road looks immaculate, and the performances are outstanding, but I feel the movie is more tasteful than emotionally resonant."
1,HORRIBLE!,"As a big movie fan who buys and watches hundreds of movies each year, this movie makes my all time bottom 10 list. In addition, it blows my mind that some people consider this a great movie. This is pretty much the only time in my life where a movie that I thought was one of the worst was ever considered by others a great movie. Be careful before buying this dvd."
2,Not my thang,"Rented this title from Redbox a while back and I just didn't understand the gist or rather found the meaning boring. Perhaps I'm simple minded or this movie just isn't my cup of tea. Top flight actors and production but the subject matter is just too common and boring. While others may write a detailed analysis, I have a single word that describes this suburban couple, spoiled.Entertainment wise on the secondary market ""Revolutionary Road (2008)"" doesn't appear to have sustainable value compared to titles like ""Mulholland Drive (2001)"", ""While You Were Sleeping (1995)"", and ""Angel-A (2005)."" All of these titles have a much higher secondary market value than Revolutionary Road. Revolutionary Road as of this writing can be had for less than $5 OTD (out the door)."
1,Depressing,"Depressing, depressing, depressing. 2 depressing hours of arguing and fighting. Just when you think it will start to get better..................it doesn't. Take Paxil, Prozac, and Zoloft before starting this movie. The only thing I got out of this movie was, if there are too many ""me"" instead of ""us"", the marriage will not last. Maybe that's why the divorce rate is so high. Did I forget to mention that this movie is depressing."
4,Revolutionary Road by Brandon M. Moskos,"This movie was based on the book with the same title by Richard Yates. I pre-ordered this dvd mainly because of the cast in it. I didn't see this movie in the theaters. I watched it and realized that DiCaprio and Winslet make this movie a good movie. It is about a couple in the 1950's who are not happy with the modern life of those times, and want to break free from everyday life. Like I said, DiCaprio and Winslet are tremendous in this movie. The viewer really feels like they are in the 1950's. Other than the acting, I was disappointed in the film. I don't think all of the arguing was needed in this movie, and I found myself being quite bored at times. Please watch this movie for the great acting, but don't expect too much from the story."
2,I WANTED TO LIKE THIS MOVIE...,"It's not that it was depressing, or dark. It wasn't the predictable ending. It wasn't the era it took place in... It was just not that good. It was over-acted and had a story that really goes nowhere.I like deep movies from time to time, like AMERICAN BEAUTY, or MAGNOLIA, but this just didn't make sense. Why didn't they just go to Paris for Christ sakes? And the kids weren't even in more than 2 shots. Must've been playing marbles in the attic.Anyways, Leonardo's been on a roll with THE DEPARTED and BLOOD DIAMOND, I guess it was time to phone a friend or vice versa. Kate was good in ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND, but not much since. I still hope for good things from her, but this was a bit off for her...sorry."
3,Not particularly original or engaging,"I completely agree with and have the same sentiments as Andaluz's review from Feb 09. The whole story seemed to be an unnecessary downer. The early parts and their meeting and passion didn't seem compelling, so references to or implications that they -used to be happy- and exciting don't really make sense.I believe there were patterns for happy living that people were supposed to follow back then, and that the majority of them found happiness despite this - those would be the interesting stories. These people are just unhappy and seem to hate each other and can think of no better or more creative way to live than to carry out the hellishness they've created. Hoorah. A character who actually attempts something valiant or at least tough or mildly interesting is needed here, but neither character seems to even want to try taking a hard problem head on.A generous three star rating only for the acting (3 or 4) and the set, lighting, clothes, etc (3)."
3,"Wonderfully acted, but leaves you disconnected.","I watched this film last night and was actually a bit disappointed by it. It is well written, acted, and directed, but the emotional distance the characters feel towards each other also affected how I connected with them. In the end, I didn't care enough. It was empty."
2,Unlikeable characters in a prison of their own making,"Frank and April Wheeler are unlikeable characters trapped in a prision of their own making...It was hard to maintain sympathy for April Wheeler. She could have taken her husband up on the offer of therapy, but she did not...instead she chose to wallow in her misery and shriek at Frank. Frank Wheeler, no prize either, could have found a position elsewhere, yet he too chose to wallow. Frank's consolation prize was the young woman from the secretarial pool. This is the type of movie that has some people reaching for the anti-depressants and beginning a course of therapy...not because their own lives are wretched but because they are depressed by the unecessary wretchedness of the Wheelers."
2,Mendes And Cliches,"Moviegoers who found ""American Beauty"" forced and its satirical targets largely way over the top (viz. Annette Bening's character and actions) would do well to avoid ""Revolutionary Road."" This film is positively dug out with a steam shovel, its revelation of 1950's conformity by Sam Mendes about as revolutionary and exciting as a rediscovery of the wheel.An equally tiresome aspect of the film is the blatant overacting of both Winslet and DiCaprio in just about all of their scenes -lots of screaming and yelling, with less going on than meets the ears.Finally, there's the casting of DiCaprio in grown up roles. An excellent actor as a youth, unfortunately, like Patty Duke, he's hard to believe when cast in adult parts. He invariably resembles just a high school boy made up to portray someone years older, and it's too easy to separate the actor from the character being portrayed. All in all, this is in no way a memorable film."
3,DARK (not what I was expecting),This movie was well acted and decent story but way more dark then I expected. Don't go looking for a up lifting story this is not it.
1,"Awful, depressing & sad","Purchased this movie thinking it was a romantic drama. It started rather slow & sad & got progressively worse - bad language, horribly sad storyline. I literally threw it away - not fit to even pass on nor sell to anyone else"
2,This One Totally Misfired,"I tend to agree with those that think American Beauty was a better film, but unlike most, I found Revolutionary Road horribly miscast, especially Kate Winslet. Of course her husband having directed the film has nothing to do with it. The subject matter I always find fascinating and Mendes does a decent enough job. For me, the masterpiece for which all others are judged will always be Burt Lancaster's The Swimmer.The Swimmer [Region 2]If we're lucky, HBO might consider a series based on the short stories by John Cheever, and while we're at it, the short stories of J.G. Ballard. Good timing with all the angst the middle class is going through now."
1,Pass this one up,"I love Leo DiCaprio and he's an amazing actor, but this movie put me to sleep. It's just boreing as hell. Not every movie can be great."
2,Subtle Propaganda Film,"There can be only one purpose in bringing this story to the screen (besides trying to make money on a low-budget effort) - to further undermine Americans' belief in their culture and values and replace it with empty Hollywood cynicism. If you stop believing in the American dream, then you should be happy in today's world where the ""with it"" people believe in nothing smacking of integrity, optimism, or deeper meaning. If you want to see famous actors constantly smoking, drinking, cursing, and self-destructing while pretending to be Mr. and Mrs. Cleaver, and if you want to reinforce the idea that middle class values are fraudulent, then this movie is perfect."
2,scam,this book does not even compare to other books on clay projects. It apparently hides behind a couple of religious quotes as a reason to over-charge for a minimal treatment of polymer clay projects.
5,An impressive book!,"This book is a must-have for people of all ages who enjoy working with polymer clay. The instructions for making cute critters in this book are very easy to follow, and fun!My favorites are Rocky Raven and Cocoa Moose.I can't wait for Joshua's next book!"
4,"An exciting, if biased and highly romanticized account","Stewart's account of the Donner Party is famous for its drama and readability, and has introduced many readers to the compelling story of the snowbound pioneers. Stewart's views regarding Native Americans, Catholics and Hispanics color his depiction of events, however, and more recent studies of the Donner event have focused on correcting this most popular work on the subject."
5,intriguing. . .,Ordeal by Hunger is a triumphant portrayal of the human spirit. . . frightningly real.
3,"A fairly good book -I liked ""SURIVAL"" better.","This is a good book, but like I stated above,I liked Survival better. This book has so much more of the writer's comments - I got lost in all the added material - did not hold my interest."
4,Simple but gripping narrative,"George Stewart's 1936 account of the Donner Party's ordeal in the Sierra Nevada mountains is simply told, with elementary prose and little color commentary from the author. But that makes it all the more gripping, like a black and white photograph. The stark telling makes poignant the stuggles of this group of unfortunate people.The one thing truly lacking is a good map. It's really a shame b/c the story is a bit hard to follow geographically with the maps provided. Any future revision of this book should definitely remedy this situation."
4,Festival treasure,"I first saw Tim Janis performing at an annual festival where I live. I was so taken by the beauty of the music so I purchased 2 cd's, including this one. I was amazed, to say the least. The music is so uplifting. Every time I listen to the songs, it's like I am hearing them for the first time again. I listen to this cd at night before bed, it's so relaxing. I highly recommend this, you won't be disappointed."
5,An Extraordinary Talent!,"I can't believe the reaction I have received on Tim Janis! I bought December Morning and Arcadia for 6 different family members as Christmas gifts (after reading a great article on Tim in the Boston Globe). Since then, I am continually thanked by all as they are blown away with how fantastic his music is! I had never heard Tim's music prior to Christmas 2001, and the descriptive reviews here at Amazon are true to the sound of Tim Janis. The most appropriate review I read described his sound as reminiscent of a classic hollywood movie soundtrack. The music transports you to another place and time. Great stuff here! Kudos to you Tim - you are truly gifted!"
3,"Not bad, but a bit predictable.",The music is soothing and beautiful in its way but less sublime than predictably climactic. I'd like this kind of music to be a little less easy to anticipate.
5,An easy way to discuss something difficult,"The Little Chapel That Stood was the perfect vehicle for discussing the complicated subject of 9-11 with my young nieces and nephews. The story was informative and inspiring, and the beautiful illustrations captivated the kids. We all learned a lot. Most importantly, when they ask me to reread it, I'm just as eager to read this lyrical history as they are to hear it. What a gem!"
2,Poor illustrations,"I really wanted to like this book. The text is nice and I think my 3rd grade students will respond well to the way it approaches a very serious moment in American history. Unfortunately, on many pages, the focal point of the picture is lost because it falls in the folds where the pages are bound together. I bought it based on positive reviews from teachers and counselors, but if I had seen the disappointing illustrations I would have passed. Can't believe a good editor allowed this oversight - illustrations are very important in a children's book."
5,Very cute,This book is great to read to the class. All the students loved it. It is about the WTC that collapsed but from a different view. It definitely gives a lot of information but in a soft way. It does not give intricate details just the gist of what happened.
1,Another piece of eugenic fantasy,"Despite the fact that no gene has ever been identified as a cause of Bipolar Disorder (or any other mental illness), the myth continues that this is a genetic disorder. Instead, you get a series of poorly designed gene linkage studies that are never successfully repeated, although printed as fact in large national newpapers after newsconferences by overexuberant, tenure-seeking scientists. Show me the money (or the gene)! The idea that we are genetic robots is a myth created by scientists who want to believe that human nature, including great art can be reduced to genes. The notion is absurd and, in my opinion, dangerous. I don't have to go too far back in history to support my opinion."
4,Ordered as a present 2,The Item was ordered as a present. The delivery was prompt and the reciever was very Pleased
3,Lots of repetition,"As with the ""small stuff"" books, there is some nice and practical advice with a lot of repetition."
3,wrong impression,"I think you all don't get it. Everything that LaurynHill is singing about is real, especially since 9/11. I do agree that prehaps its a little to serious but and all fairness so was The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill when it first came out people had never quite heard anything like that. One can hope that since she has now expessed her political views she will just go back to what her fan base is use to. But for true fans this cd is a must just for the collection."
2,Not worth the wait,"It must be at least 3 or 4 years since we last heard from Lauryn Hill and this album is really dissapointing. Its all new material but none of it is anywhere near as innovative as her Miseducation album. Not only is the music weak but Lauryn spends half of her time preaching about God and religion etc etc and stressing how shes no longer a ""performer""... or something like that anyway, by mid-way through the first interlude i'd fallen asleep. WE DONT CARE!!! JUST MAKE GOOD MUSIC!!""So Much Things To Say"" is the best track and is just about the only one that survives the the fact she doesnt seem to have been looking after her voice. She also hits the wrong chord two or three times in each song and, rather than keep going, stops the music and then starts again a few moments later.This is the biggest dissapointment ive ever had in a CD. Oh, and one other thing - the UK edition wont play on computers so if you dont have a hi-fi beware!"
1,Check out Tracy Chapman instead,"While I agree that Lauren Hill is a talent, I believe that she is reaching on this recording. I was futher convinced when I saw her at the Smokin Grooves concert(zzz.....boring). Her songs lack originality, creativiy, excitement and her guitar playing is average at best. Sorry Lauren...for this genre of music, I'll stick with someone who know how to do it, Tracy Chapman"
1,Waste of talent,"Ah now she wants to play the freaking acoustic guitar, between she and India Arie I don't know who plays the worst, damn, how boring"
2,Definitely Lacking...A Huge Disappointment,"If you want to hear meaningless rambling by Lauryn Hill this is the album for you. Almost every song is preluded by her talking for almost 1 minute. I purchased this expecting something fresh and original but instead, I got this disappointing album. Hopefully Sony has more to offer, it's no wonder it took almost a year for them to decide to release it. I understand she's having personal problems, but keep that off of the album Lauryn!!! On this cd she reminds me of a weak India Arie. If you get a good deal purchase it, but it's not something that you'll remember for years, months, weeks, or days to come."
3,Hard to listen to more than once,"Warning, this album is VERY unplugged. Just Lauryn and her guitar and 7 'interludes' where she talks to the audience. Whilst this may be of interest once or twice it's not something you want to hear again and again. Aswell as that her guitar work, although excellent, is very repetitive. Since the CD won't play on a PC or MAC you can't even edit it all on to another CD.Lauryn has been through some soul searching times and has tried to put it all in (sometimes far too many) words but you can't help feeling she still takes herself far too seriously. Voice - 5 out of 5 but album - an interesting one-off listen. Borrow someone else's before you buy it."
2,too much talking,"Way too much talking - at least 1/3 of the 2-CD set features Lauryn talking about various topics - this could easily have been a single CD. The large amount of non-musical material is a real drag.The music is good, but Lauryn's limited experience on the guitar is evident in the fact that nearly every song sounds similar.Overall - a big disappointment. I can only hope that the next Studio release makes up for this clunker."
2,Bizarre,Lauryn Hill is singing for herself on this album becuse she certainly isn't thinking about her audience. Her voice is hoarse. She's playing the guitar (badly) with no back up. She has several spoken monolouges in between songs and cries at the end of one. In the movie Coalminer's Daughter the actress playing county singer Loretta Lynn has a scene where she cracks up in front of a live audience. That's just what this album reminds me of. I realize that Ms.Hill has had some tough times but don't ask me to pay money to listen to her navel gazing. This half baked album is an insult to her audience.
5,6 Stars. 7. 8.,"I just read about 40 of the reviews. I honestly am concerned with the lack of depth in some of the reviews. This album is not a ""follow up"" of ""Miseducation..."". This is TOTALLY on another level. Man, I cried when I heard ""I Gotta Find Peace of Mind""... and that was on CD! When I saw the DVD, it was all over. This album is pure music. Not some doctored up, studio [crud] that gets edited to death and re-done so that it is ""perfect"". Only something natural can be perfect."
4,REBIRTH,"Listening to the songs on this album, made me fall in love with Lauryn Hill's talents all over again. It's as though I was hearing her voice for the first time. Her sound is very fresh & clean, very acoustic. The music is honest & true, it's real!"
5,"Spiritual words of blessing, strength & Freedom","Each song is filled with so much... Every song has so much meaning and depth. She's grown spiritually and is ready to share her wealth of spiritual wisdon with the world. Her spirit is so full, so sincere and her voice ministers to your spirit.She has become a light in the darkeness ..."
5,Her music gets better and better!! This cd is GREAT!,"I am a teen and i must say i LOVE her new album. Even though different from her earlier sound... it is so very great! She has a wonderful use of words and her songs are all filled with such meaning and emotion!! It is the best cd i have ever heard and her best yet! It is constantantly being moved from my cd player in my room.. to my car ... and to my cd player in my backpack at school! i always want to listen to it more and more! it has such an effect on listeners (a positive one) and a message as well, (to be true and to love yourself no matter what anyone else thinks). i reccomend this to ANYONE who loves her beautiful voice, and wonderfuly inspirational lyrics."
2,so much for talking...,"A very strange record this is. Lauryn Hill sings her songs in a demo format, and talks a lot. It is a very demanding experience. And after listening to it for more then three times, you really want to hear ONLY the songs, if at all.Hill says it's her reaction to fame, but what this really sums up to is a bunch of songs (some great, some so-so) that have potential and might become big hits for others, after they put them through a studio and a producer works on them.Sorry. A big pretentious disappointment."
3,How about this,"The current trend with new artists is to release a big selling cd then release a live version (with a bonus track or two) of the same cd a year or so later. So maybe Lauryn should flip it and go in the studio and really work up these songs, keeping the artistic integrity, but give them a little studio polish. We know she has the gifts, and these songs are very good. I'd like to hear em fleshed out more, not overproduced, maybe hook up with someone like Jon Brion or Daniel Lanois or TBone Burnett and give em a sound that is a departure from the cookie cutter rhythm and bulls@$t that's out now. Just a thought."
3,Bordering moderate,"If this was Lauryn Hill's first album I probably would of given it 4 stars. But taking into account her first solo debut, I just can't rate this very high. It's nowhere near as good and gets quite demanding to listen to after a while.I wouldn't take this with me on holiday, but I find myself still taking ""The Miseducation..."", because it's on a much higher level.The album is a raw collection of acoustic folk music- nothing sounds like anything on her previous album(s).Some of the tracks are beautiful and have intelligent lyrics but they all sound too similar!Another big problem is that there are way too many interludes.The singing is excellent, but she's starting to cackle and crack up a bit (on 1 or 2 tracks she appears to be going insane!)Don't get me wrong it is a good strong album, but it's far too raw for my liking."
5,Overlooked Masterpiece,"Anyone still waiting for Lauryn Hill's follow up missed it. This was it. This is reality TV right here. Only in retrospect do I now see what she was trying to do here. This album should be revisited by critics and the general public. It's a masterpiece and represents the future of music. This is not Lauryn Hill doing the ""MTV Unplugged thing"" - doing all her past hits acoustically and covering some other songs by friends (ie. Nirvana Unplugged.) This is Lauryn Hill performing her entire new album live, one time only, sometimes stopping and starting over in the middle of a track and making personal, reflective comments between songs. Artists need to look to this album seriously and consider that what was being done here was much deeper than it appears on the surface."
1,A complete disappointment,"When I first saw this album I was intrigued by it since the usual MTV unplugged series are worth listening to. The artist Lauryn Hill and her first album, the miseducation are a great inspiration to everyone, but she must have had a total blackout on stage while recording this album. What a crap. Some of the songs are worth listening to but most of the babbling she does in between could be removed without any pain. It feels like when she put this filler between the songs for reflection and inspiration she must have been thinking, mmm maybe I need to give my fans some motivation why I am NOT 100% at the moment. Come on Lauryn!! Give us another miseducation or rejoin the Fugees!! You could leave the songwriting to Wycleff."
4,STOP HATIN'!,"The CD is Tight, but not for everyone so listen before you buy.Sal the poetic is a HATER! Who cares if she messed around with Wyclef! Or if she ain't married! Get out her business!ONE"
1,I ONLY WISH THAT I COULD GIVE ZERO STARS,"MAN there is only one pharse that describes this ""album"" and I do use the term lossely....""self absorbed"". Yep thats it folks. I mean the only person I have ever seen that enjoys hearing themselves talk that much is the ""JOKER"", President Bush, and Hillary Cliton. And two of them are supervillians and one is the devil...I'll let you guess who."
5,Brilliant,"Lauryn Hill's unplugged album is, in many ways, the ultimate live album. She talks to the crowd, discusses how certain songs came to be, cracks jokes and shows raw emotion throughout, truly making her voice heard. The album's strongest moment comes on ""Mystery of Intiquity"" when she raps and plays with such emotion that the crowd can't help but cheer her on.'MTV Unplugged No. 2.0' is a beautiful album and easily the best in the Unplugged series since Nirvana left that New York crowd in awe years ago."
3,Good but...,"This is a CD that certainly was not what I was expecting. It is very personal, quite heavy and not a typical one. For a huge L. Hill fan could be perfect but for someone who would like to ""meet"" her and listen to a whole work for the first time I do not think is recommended. Moreover, it is very specific in style and very much of the same sound all CD through that after some tracks you are already overwhelmed."
5,Stunning!,"The quality of the songs, the message in them, and Lauryn's voice and outlook on life lifts this album from a mere recording to a powerful social phenomenon. Listening to this album makes you wake up and experience what music and being human is all about. I don't know of any other contemporary musician making music with so much relevancy and significance. Lauryn, your star shines bright."
5,SHE IS BACK AND GIVING US A FACE2FACE REALITY CHECK!,"Lauryn is back and I presume she will rack up many music awards this year. I love her cd and can appreciate her growth and honesty on this one for sure. Don't be mistaken the first is good but my opinion this one is better. Why? Because it's raw and it's real talent come on I mean she plays most of the music with just a guitar. No, she isn't the first but I love her music, style, accomplishment, honesty, knowledge (personal and political).It is worth your purchase and if nothing else the entire family will enjoy it. Pick it up for a teenager and let them hear and feel the knowledge that is definitely flowing on this one here. She is in a class by herself and she should be proud if no one else is because what matters most is how LAURYN sees herself.Enough sai"
5,In your face truth,This presentation by Ms. Hill is daring and a challenge to all who say they know God.
5,This Album is the Truth,"The voice, The Lyrics, everything she talking about is TRUTH! Her message is clear, if you listen. Find God, and GET OUT! GET OUT! GET OUT!"
2,A Bad Car Wreck of a Album,"funny how just a few Years Back Lauryn Hill was the Toast of the Biz.when you hear this Set you have to be reminded of that time because this two-Set will make you think what Happened?? the Guitar Playing&Her Arrangements go nowhere they just are like One Long Random Play that has no Start,Middle or End.Her Voice isn't that strong over the course of the set either.I give Her Props for Being Daring to drop a Double Live Set but that's as far as it goes.this Set Crashes before it has a chance to turn the Corner."
4,Truth is Freeing,I think the CD is insightful and very genuine. I have a new found respect for Lauryn and her music.
5,Brilliance,"What an excellent album. There are no words to really describe what Lauryn Hill has accomplished here. If you liked Miseducation, then you'll absolutely love this. Lauryn has a harder and deeper edge with a compassion you won't find many musicians with nowadays. You can feel the raw emotion in every word she sings. Lauryn seems to have a sense of being humble with this album. She lets you know she wasn't caught up in everything after Miseducation's success. She's grown into a moving and powerful musician.This is easily the best unplugged session that has ever come from MTV. It was well worth the wait for new material from Lauryn Hill."
3,lauryn hill unplugged,"I like lauryn hill, but in this cd she didn't sing her best songs, good document,is cool to listen but......."
5,god bless the child,"I should begin by saying that I thought Miseducation was genious.Lauryn's unplugged is as raw and beautiful as the grand canyon. Her voice was as beautiful as her songs. Lauryn sang, played, and spoke as real as she felt and it connected. She sings it the way most of us feel it everyday. Lauryn dares to color outside the lines and by the end of her journey you can't help but feel hopeful. In these crazy times all I can say is thank you lauryn."
2,Disappointed Fan,"I was looking forward to this release for years...it's lacking quite a bit, though. All the songs sound very similar. Lauryn and a guitar just do not cut it. When these songs are re-worked and produced they will be much better. It sounds like a demo folk tape. Sorry, Lauryn."
1,Troubling Rough Draft,"Love Lauryn, love her lyrics, but this album disappoints. Borrow it before you buy it. The excessive confessionals and complaints between songs become tiresome, and Lauryn is in poor voice throughout. Unfortunately, it's embarrassing. Even the 2-disc format makes me uncomfortable. Although the spiritual and Christian content is awesome and refreshing and her guitar playing is enjoyable, the album feels like a rough draft. I hope Lauryn polishes up these songs and releases them in good voice without the awkward rambling in-between. Until then, I'll be wishing I could get my money back."
2,Very Weak Effort,Personal revelation and brutal honestly in an album doesn't make good music. This is a very bland effort with three-note guitar playing and songs that go no where. I certainly hope Lauryn will recover and once again give us the great music for which we have known her.
1,The Looooooong and Winded Road,"The saddest fall from grace since Dylan's ""Self Portrait"". Seemingly unrehearsed, off key, incoherent mumblings about stardom, religious platitudes, Bossa Nova, Reggae, Pop, R&B and a whole lotta talkin', it's just Hill and her acoustic guitar - for 2 interminable CD's. Ya can't fault a girl her convictions and passion, but that affectivity gets buried from the longwinded chunter to the point of exhaustion. She seems less than the whole of her talent and ability. Her debut solo CD was a revelation...and while I do not want to fall into the trappings of comparison, there has to be some sort of cohesion - there should be more self-respect to her craft than whining at her version of the Wailing Wall and releasing it to an unsuspecting fan base. If it's so dreadful being famous, then stop being famous. Oh, wait. Mission accomplished. My grade: D"
1,I got to listen to this CD again.,Because I do not know what this people are talking about. This CD stinks. Please do not waste your money on this CD like I did b/c it'll be one of those CD's you regret buying and it's just there to take up place in your CD collection. Please do not buy this CD.
2,so much for talking...,"A very strange record this is. Lauryn Hill sings her songs in a demo format, and talks a lot. It is a very demanding experience. And after listening to it for more then three times, you really want to hear ONLY the songs, if at all.Hill says it's her reaction to fame, but what this really sums up to is a bunch of songs (some great, some so-so) that have potential and might become big hits for others, after they put them through a studio and a producer works on them.Sorry. A big disappointment."
5,All of them,"I enjoyed the cd it is real, truthful and what every women needs to hear and know about our truth and emotions. I feel what she is saying and feel it is what I am living right now. Thank you Lauryn you reminded me of my truth spirit."
5,The Realest,"I have been eagerly anticipating Lauryn Hill's follow-up for a long time. Yeah, I heard the rumors, saw the pictures of a Lauryn that seemed very different from the public persona we had seen previously. She appeared to be in some sort of emotional transition. I empathized with the sister, but hoped that this transition would take her to another level and yield purer results in her subsequent endeavors.This is not a ""bob your head, pump the bass in your jeep"" kinda cd, but rather a ""listen to the message & feel the vibe"" kinda flow. I love the music. LOVE it. But even moreso, I love seeing how this woman has grown spiritually and is willing to share with us so that we might get to know her instead of the ""icon"", and be prompted to start our own journey of self-exploration.This is real, y'all. No gloss & sparkle (sista got hoarse voice, okay?) Check it out.--HeavnsGirl"
3,Best Available Bird Book,"This is the best bird book currently available for birding in Costa Rica. I consider it a must-have. A better field guide is currently being written, but it'll be a couple more years before it's available.It's a good guide, but here are my criticisms: This book is a bit too big for a field guide. The drawings of the birds are separate from descriptions and range information. Some of the drawings aren't accurate - check the descriptions for a good ID. If you're going far north or south, you may want to supplement with books on Panamanian and Nicaraguan birds, since this guide doesn't include rare migrants. The organization uses a slightly different taxonomic order than North American field guides."
3,helpful but outdated,"The plates are very helpful but a number of bird names have changed and splits have occured since publication so many years ago. It's long past time for a new, updated edition."
5,Book I Refer to the Most,"I have lived on the Pacific of Costa Rica for 5 years and find myself constantly referring to this book - one that was recommended to me by virtually every person I spoke to who knew I was relocating to Costa Rica.For other fans of this book, you may be interested to know that one of the authors, Alexander Skutch, recently passed away at the age of 99. He was a long-time resident of Costa Rica and long admired in ornithological circles. A memorial service was held for Mr. Skutch on May 20th - his 100th birthday - at the Tropical Science Center in Perez Zeledon, in the Southern Zone of Costa Rica.Please refer to an article in The Tico Times, May 14, 2004 edition."
5,Wonderful book,I used this book during a recent trip to Costa Rica and it was extremely helpful in identifying the birds. I actually removed the picture plates and carried them while birding since the entire book is too heavy to carry while birding. The plate pages give a lot of information about the various birds and you can refer to the rest of the book at a later time. I would recommend this book to anyone who is going to be birdwatching in Costa Rica.
2,"Entertaining, but not enlightening","This book is an novelty piece for those interested in Cryptozoology, as it was among the very first books published on the matter and managed to bring attention to the entire Abominable Snowman phenomena, however, it is unresearched and laregly based on heresay. It leans towards sensationalizing the story to a point where it reads as though it was published by the Weekly World News.Still, it is entertaining."
3,Turns Fingers Orange,"Just a short warning. Since this is in tablet form, if you hold it in your fingers for more than a second, it turns your fingers orange. Mildly irritating. I have a monthly vitamin sorter, so I use plastic gloves when I'm adding the turmeric. Other than that, it seems to work fine."
1,Disappointing,"While the message is a good one, it nearly gets lost in this very poorly written book."
1,"Please, let this be the last one...","These authors might as well wear masks as they write. Their books are featherweight-no real substance. I find it hard to believe that anyone but a true business novice could get anything from these two books.If you are a high level manager in Corporate America, please do not disrespect your employees and make them read these books. Roll up your sleeves, dig in, and apply solid leadership skills. Having employees read books of this ilk DOES NOT accomplish the desired effect. These type of books are read and then quickly (hopefully, in this case) forgotten. These FISH books represent the SEE SPOT RUN of American business literature. Weak does not come close to a proper description."
2,For major FISH! Fans only....,"A friend loaned me this book because she thought I might be interested in it. It didn't live up to my expectations, although it did have a few good points.There are three things I liked about this book. First, the principles, if a bit simplistic and basic, are still sound ones. Second, the authors wrote the book in a way that I wasn't lost even though I hadn't read the first book in the series. And last, some of the activities in the second half of the book might be useful for some people.I personally didn't find that there was anything new in the book that I hadn't read in other places. I got bored fairly quickly, even though it was an easy read. There are only two groups of people I'd reccommend this book to -- those who absolutely loved the first book and want to have the sequel for personal, sentimental reasons, and those who in skimming through it are intrigued by the exercises and want to do them."
2,Nike nano armband for nike + system,"The only thing I don't like about it is that it doesn't have a clear plastic window so that you can see the info screen of the IPOD! It is more durable than the after market armband and it also looks better but as far as using it, the aftermarket one is so much better solely because you don't have to take the Ipod out of the band every time you need to see the screen. Guess that is why the price was so incredible."
3,Armband,It is a good product for people who like to enjoy music while working out. It is very comfortable and practical.
1,Pretty awful.,"I bought this to go running. The band is very small, barely fits on my arm. The button area on the front does not match up with my ipod Nano so when it is in the sleeve, i can't switch songs or mess with the volume. I would have to pull the nano out of the sleeve, switch songs, find a good volume, and then put it back into the sleeve. When you pull it out of the sleeve, the headphones often pull out of the bottom. As you can imagine, I found this all out while running on a treadmill and almost killed myself trying to get a song i liked to play at the correct volume. I really thought I was getting a deal because this was a Nike band, but it seems even Nike can put out a turd every now and again. This is fine if you don't need to switch songs or change the volume, and have skinny arms. I guess you get what you pay for, because this was pretty cheap."
1,A Very Poor Choice,"The lack of a clear panel prevents you from seeing the screen of your Nano, so you are completely unable to choose songs or playlists without removing the armband in the midst of a workout. Utterly useless."
2,Get the updated version,"I have used this version for a few months. It's makes it hard to use the Nike+ feature, because you can't see the screen. Mine stretched out quickly, from multiple times pulling my iPod in and out to start and stop the program. There are better models out there. Nike has tried to remedy the problem by putting out one with screen, to see the nano's screen and work it easier. I replaced mine with a Marware wrist holder for my iPod, with a space for the chip. I like it much better."
2,Needs view window,"I like everything about it except the lack of a window. It is comfortable to wear on runs and doesn't slip but if you like to look at your screen or playlists, you are out of luck with this armband. I look at my playlists at the beginning of my runs and even change it up on long runs and it is too difficult without a window...so I cut one. Looks bad but is functional. I suggest waiting for the window version...it has to be coming soon."
3,Better products out there,"This is a comfortable armband once you get it on. It's not an easy one-handed operation since it doesn't have the reverse direction bracket, therefore you have to hold it and Velcro it on at the same time. Also, although I knew I wouldn't be able to see the screen while working out, it does make it difficult to set up for the Nike+iPod program, which makes the timer option of the Nike+iPod program useless. It's difficult to lock as well. I switch back to my other generic armband unless I'm using the Nike+iPod feature, then I have to use this one."
1,Tossed it away,"Unless you want to see the screen of your ipod, do not get it.I am not sure how this item is still on sale."
5,This Could Be The Best CD I've Heard Yet,"The first time I heard the song Valley Of The Shadow on our local radio station I knew I had to hear more. My friend Rhonda Gunn honestly gave gospel music it's best CD to be found anywhere. I'm not sure anyone has equalled the amount of hits from one single album. Whether you like Inspirational or Contemporary Christian, Rhonda bridges the gap with music that will make you feel the lyrics as only she can sing them. This gal not only talks the talk but she walks the walk. You can't go wrong with FORGIVENESS."
4,good introduction,a very basic introduction to singing. good for those with absolutely no vocal training experience. nuff said.
1,Disapointingly generic and short on detail,"This flimsy publication lacks anything beyond the bare miniumum of detailed information on the featured pieces in this exhiition and the accompanying text was dissapointingly generic. There are a couple of really good books on Naga art, such as ""The Nagas, Hill People of North East India"", but this is not one of them. The word that describes it best is superficial. I am sorry I bought it."
4,Buena Coleccion,"Contiene 20 de los mejores exitos desde 1962 al 1982; los primeros 4 o 5 temas no son las canciones originales que interpretaba Pellin pero Charlie y Jerry hacen un excelente trabajo en interpertar ""La Muerte"", ""Acangana"", ""Los Ojos Chinos"", y ""El Caballo Pelotero"". Las otras canciones son buenisimas tambien. Cantantes incluyen Charlie, Jerry, y Andy (Montanez). Algo malo es que el CD tiene poco volumen pero como sea, TURN IT UP."
3,Kind of disappointing,"This video starts with the Byrds' classic ""Eight miles high,"" only problem it's a performance that dates from the early 70's when they had turned into a Grateful Dead-ish hippie jam band-the funky instrumental you hear is only recognizahle as the classic song when Roger boredly plays the signature riff early on. I wouldn't have minded it so much if they had put this at the end with the credits running over it. Besides that, you get good stuff from bands like the Who, Small Faces, Thunderclap Newman, and Blue Cheer, but it's all lip-synched. The only other actual live performance is the closing number by the Nice, which is more prog than psychedelic. Not as good as the Heavy Metal video of this series, or the British Invasion one."
3,psychedelic delight,"very nice video, tough some of the b&w scenes are defenitly missing some colors, but still very nice title"
4,"Great shirt, but NOT colorfast","I love, Love, LOVE my hemp shirts. I really do. However, for some reason I thought these were colorfast. Still, being inately cautious, I washed my red shirt first, then wore it and tossed it in the laundry with my ""naturaL"" shirt. My natural is now pink. OK, I'm not Laundry Super Hero Boy, but still. I'm not happy about the pink thing, but I do still love my shirts. I'd give it a five unreservedly except for the whole stressful colorfast issue."
1,Not For Kids!,This book places reality and a Dark Ages view of hell in the same context. It is an extremely confusing and frightening book for the age group of suggested readers. My son an avid reader was disturbed by some of the pictures and had a difficult time differentiating reality from ancient mythic world views. Definitely not on any of my kids reading lists!!!!!
2,Not what expected,"Looking for a book on construction, I came across this text. I guess I should have read the reviews, because the content was not underground construction, which is what I was looking for. As a teacher, my 9 yr. old students would be terrified at some of these pages of hell and dungeons. While nor gorey, there is still an insinuation. I may return it."
5,Soft and sweet,"If I smell this perfume, around in a place where others are, I must see who's wearing it. This is by far my favorite scent on a woman. I bought 6 bottles of this for my wife, and she constantly get's compliments on it. People are always asking ""what kind of perfume are you wearing, where can I get it?""- nuff said"
3,Mediocre baby and toddler food book,"""First Meals: Fast, Healthy, and Fun Foods to Tempt Infants and Toddlers"" is a nice hardcovered book with an interesting layout and lots of pictures. The recipes taste good, but really take some time to put together. Occasionally I will make a recipe out of this book, but not often.A problem I had with this book was that it seemed to introduce foods too early, things like vegetable sticks at an age when a chunk could be bitten off and choked on, or before a baby was able to eat that particular food.I'm on the fence with giving this book two stars, and I would really give it 2 1/2, but I'll round up. All in all, there are much better baby food books out there (such as ""Mommy Made and Daddy Too""). I'd really only recommend this one to supplement your others, or if you collect cookbooks."
5,"A great, lifesaving book for Moms of picky eaters","I bought this book after trying for months -- and failing -- to try to get my baby to eat a variety of solid foods. I admit that at first I was skeptical that 1. I would have the time and ambition to make these recipes and that 2. they would be the trick to trigger my son's eating -- but, miraculouly, it worked! The purees are extemely simple to make and Annabel Karmel offers lots of good nutritional advice and easy-to-follow tips on ensuring that your baby has fresh, healthy food to eat. Favorite recipes include the avocado and banana puree and bow-tie pasta with ham and peas."
1,Dangerous foods,"I agree that this book recommends feeding infants foods way before they are ready. Especially, dairy, meats and strawberries. Very misleading."
4,Quick and easy to follow recipes,"I found this book when my son was almost two. After making several of the recipes he has more variety in his meals, but still dislikes certain food no matter how it is prepared (such as the meatball recipe). The food is easy to make, and less time consuming than those in ""adult"" recipe books. The foods are geared towards the taste buds of a child, which is something I enjoy about the book. There are lots of recipes to choose from, but I was disappointed at the lack of recipes containing beef. I do not own a food processor which several of the recipes require--but using my blender has been fine for most recipes. If you are looking for a book that offers simple, tasty alternatives for meal planning this book is a great place to start."
5,My cooking bible,"Read the reviews below about the cautions for this book (certain foods introduced too early, etc.) Then, go ahead and buy this book. I became the family cook for the first time and have methodically worked my way through almost recipe in the book. The recipes are easy to follow and make, give nutritional background, are included in a weekly meal planner, and more importantly, are almost all good. There are a few that bombed, but on the whole, I don't know how I would have survived my baby's first 16 months without this book. It will give you the confidence to NOT buy processed baby food and will give you the confidence to introduce complicated foods to your child before you might otherwise (I'm talking about flavors and combinations here, not the too-early introduction of milk, etc). My child can be picky, but others are amazed at the variety of foods she is willing to eat. Buy this book and her companion book, The Healthy Baby Meal Planner, also."
2,Too much work,"A friend gave me this book since she didn't use it. It had great ideas for purees for my then 6 month old daughter but past 6 months the recipes were not safe for her to eat as she didn't grow her first teeth till she was 7 months old. Of course, some ingredients are too exotic and the prep times seem way off.Ms. Karmel must have had a nanny watch her 3 kids while she cooked because as a mom of 3 myself, I can't imagine having time to cook these fooods and still have time to spend with my kids."
3,teachermommy,"Meals are good, and has good ideas, but takes lots of advance planning to make sure you have what is needed on hand."
4,Very good book about an extraordinary individual,"Prior to the Civil War there had been a major change in how wars could and would be fought. The Civil War was the first major war to be fought under this new paradigm. (The next big shift would come in WWII).I think William Sherman understood how to fight the Civil War better than any other soldier on either side. He was brilliant both in seeing how to win the war and applying that knowledge. And his campaigns were among the most brilliant of the war.This book is a well written book that gives a strong picture of William Sherman, concentrating mostly on his time during the Civil War itself. And it is a fascinating story told very well.Decent maps provided although they could have been a lot better."
3,Facts and Psychology,"Granted, Stanley P. Hirshson's books THE WHITE TECUMSEH: A BIOGRAPHY OF WILLIAM T. SHERMAN is painstakingly researched. Many facts about Sherman's life and personal experiences are detailed. Apart from the writer's presentation about Sherman's early behavior in Kentucky, the reader must infer from the general's behavior, as reported by the author, Sherman's over-all psychological profile."
5,decal transfers,"what you see is what you get, designs about corners...lots of creative ways to use these corners for contemporay art, the book, delivery, and subject matter are excellent."
1,Did you realize.......?,"Did you realize that nearly all the reveiwers are girls? Yeah, that's right. Am I the only girl who actually know what real music is? All this c.d. is about is what you can see on MTV every day. (Not trying to diss MTV, it rocks! ) Girls are screaming over some guy who is lip syncing at a concert. You can make up the lyrics or melodies to ""Can I get Your Number"" any time, and i'll bet any mony that their producers wrote these songs? *sigh* What happened to 1994? When punk and heavy metal ruled the world? Whatever. My opinon won't be heard over the voices of screaming girls."
1,Will someone please tell why everyone likes this song??,"I think that this is just a senseless, no point song and i'm sorry but they can't even sing very good. I don't even own this CD i've just heard the song and seen the video and the video is just as dumb. I've only heard this song so i'm not going to say anything bad about the other ones but if they're anything like this one then well i wouldn't recommend buying this CD."
4,Just what I expected,Prompt deliveryCD was in great conditionPlastic case was cracked--no big deal.Thank you
5,Best mens cologne ever created!,"Hands down the best cologne on the market. I get nothing but compliments when I where this. Its a light clean smelling fragrance. If your looking for something different from the overwhelmingly perfume drivin to the point where you can still smell whomever it was wearing the gallons of whatever it was even after you have left where ever you were for what seems to feel like forever. Way to many of those types of mens colognes out there. This is different then the norm and better then anything out there. You will not be disappointed, nor will anyone your hanging out with."
3,Good but not great,"Gendarme is a good smell but not a great smell ,it does last for some time I have used better stuff the price is pretty good for 4 oz.please try before you buy.George-from elpaso."
5,Excellent subtle cologne,Gendarme is an excellent cologne. It has a light musky fragrance that won't offend. An hour after applying it might seem that the scent has faded to the one wearing it. Not so. It does fade but people will still notice it. I think the idea was to make a fragrance that wouldn't offend anyone or bother asthsmatics. Some colognes are quite strong and some men just don't know the meaning of moderation. So they slap on so much you'd think they bathed in it. That can't be with Gendarme. It's pretty much impossible to overdose on it.
5,My VERY Favorite!,"I've been buying Gendarme for at least the past 20 years, back when it was only available at a West Hollywood store called ""International Male"". It has come a LONG way! Although there are a gazillion scents for men, this is my all-time favorite!"
5,Gendarme,"YUMMY. Fresh, clean, subtle. This men's cologne is the best! LOVE IT. It's been a staple fragrance of my husbands for years and will continue to be! Very good price, and super fast shipment! Great seller."
4,Good Choice,"If you want a good basic men's cologne without the overwhelming ""perfume"" smell, then this product is for you! After checking prices at various retail stores, you can't go wrong with buying it at amazon.com."
3,Could be Better,"Unfortunately this product does not smell like the one I bouht from the manufacturer. the aroma from this product is like it was diluted or something. like I said I bought from the manufacturer and one mist will smell great, with this product I have to spray myself with it in order to lightly smell like I am wearing it. Don't know what this is all about. No more buying from this seller for me."
5,Gendarme Cologne,"Great seller! Great Price! Fast delivery! I like the way it smells I bought it for my Husband for Christmas, so I don't know how he will like it."
1,Gendarme cologne,"I was impressed by the price of this classic cologne but not by its quality. It didn't have the rich scent of Gendarme of long ago. It seemed watered down and lacked the lingering fragrances of jasmine and citrus. The Gendarme website no longer offers the Gendarme by Gendarme line, yet I choose to believe that a few of the products are still out there, and will keep looking."
4,Nice citrus based men's cologne,"I have been using this product for years and find I do not get tired of it. If you like a citrus based cologne, don't be afraid to try Gendarme ""G"" for men."
3,Mild scent,Gendarme is clean smelling however the scent does not last. I agree with the reviewers who said it smells like soap. I would rate it higher if the scent was longer lasting.
1,FAKE!,"This is a fake replica! It has 'some' of the original scent in the first few sprays, but it is, overall, very watered down, and after a few days you will notice the scent is extremely weak even after spraying 3 or 4 times! DO NOT waste your money on this product!"
1,Odd one out,"My husband bought this to try it out before buying it. Glad he did. He wanted to purchase it because he is highly allergic to fragrances and had read that this one rarely causes an allergic reaction.He tried it early one evening and we gave it time to work. We kept doing sniff tests to see how we liked it but we just simply were not impressed. I don't think it smells good at all. I can't describe the smell, only that we did not care for it.And it actually did cause a reaction. Sneezy, watery eyes, etc. But it took longer to affect him than most fragrances and it wasn't as severe as some reactions he's had. Like hairspray! I can't use any type of hairspray unless it is absolutely fragrance free.All in all, I am not fond of the scent but I guess I'm the odd one out. Oh well, to each his own!"
4,Maybe even 5 stars,I have now retracted an earlier negative review. I have played it since and enjoyed it.I was overly critical. I do play it and enjoy it.(ONE AND ONLY LOVE ALBUM) REALLY DOES BLOW THIS ONE AWAY THOUGH AND I PLAY IT ALL THE TIME (100 STARS).
2,3 and 5 year old daughters,"I purchased two of these body suits and ballet slippers for my 3 and 5 year old daughters. The slippers were too tight for the 5 year old (she wears size 12) and the body suit is fairly cheaply made. The 3 year old loves the slippers, but, in two days, we've already lost two sequin hearts from two different slippers. Bottom line - bad present for a 5 year old, OK present for a 3 year old."
5,Excellent Buy!,This is a perfect bag for my Canon S5IS. The extra space for batteries and memory cards is and added advantage.
5,Perfect for my new Canon SX10IS,"Finally, my new Canon SX10IS has arrived with this well done case. The camera fits perfectly into the case, that have strong pads and internal and external compartments for memory cards or other little accesories. The lens hood can be placed in the external pocket, along with another stuff. The shoulder strap is comfortable and in the back of the case there is a strap for belt also.In summary, I'm very satisfied with this purchase."
5,Excellent Case for the Canon S-5 IS,"Received this case to carry my new Canon S-5iS. Perfect size so that the camera sits upright on the bottom with room on top for misc. stuff. Fits very snug with lots of padding to protect it. Highly recommend it. External pouch holds extra batteries, cards, etc. Get one, you can't go wrong!"
5,A Very Nice Camcorder Bag,"If you're looking for a camcorder bag that is not the size of Alaska, this is for you! It fits my DV camera, the giant battery charger, two tapes, a memory disc, and all the cords I need for most things. I do have to leave some of the digital transfer cords at home, but then again, I rarely make digital transfers when I am also taping..... Its very well made, and there's lots of room for the size. You have to plan how to fit things in, but the bag is small enough that the camcorder can be slipped into an overnight bag or carry-on. And that's exactly what we wanted it to do! :-)"
4,Case Logic TBC-4 Camcorder,"I used mine for my Fujifilm, Finepix S5200 and it fits great! What a bargain!"
5,Great Case,"This is a very nice camera case that fits my Canon S2 IS perfectly. It has enough room to fit my filters, memory card, battery charger and lens adapter."
1,Ugly and not for Canon S3 IS,"I would like to balance out the other reviews about this case and its appropriateness for the Canon S3 IS camera, which claim that it is a perfect fit. I just got mine and first, this thing is a monstrosity, one of the ugliest cases I have seen. Second, it is humongous, sure it can fit batteries along with the camera, since it actually would fit two cameras and a whole lot of batteries! Definitely not recommended, shows that one better be careful about overly positive product reviews."
5,Nice case for my Canon S2 IS,"Plenty of room for my Canon S2 IS and accessories like extra batteries, memory cards, tripod mount, and more without being overly large or bulky. Mesh pockets inside the lid and front pouch separate items and keep them secure. I can even fit my Optio WPi in a small Case Logic case in there alongside my Canon.Excellent quality and a good value."
4,Accomodating,"I bought this for my Cannon FS 200. The camera, power chord, and other wires all fit in the carry case. And there is still room for memory cards. If you are just looking for something portable to carry your camera and basic accessories, this is it!"
5,perfection!,"if i could think of any way to write the perfect song, edge of sanity has already done it for me... this cd/song captures all the elements of what a song should be. although i must say that this cd's greatness could not have been acheived with out the help of mikael akerfeldt (opeth) i hear a lot of opeth in this cd, which is not a complaint since opeth is one of the best bands out there IMO. theres not a bad riff in this entire song, and each time i hear it i get a new riff stuck in my head. ive had this cd for quite some time now, and im no where near being sick of it. the best part of this cd is the mood changes, one second you're mellow with acoustic guitar, and clean vocals, then out of nowhere, you're getting your a$$ kicked with the drummer blasting away, and the godly growl of mikael akerfeldts vocals. this cd like all opeth cd's is a huge influence on just about all the material i write for my own band. if like opeth you love this! enough said!"
5,Uncomprimisingly Brilliant,"OK, here are the facts:-Dan Swano, one of the best vocalists/songwriters in the melodic death genre-CRIMSON: THE best melodic death metal record...EVER. Tops even Dark Tranquility's ""The Gallery"".Now you listen and be the judge...but then again i'm sure you're going to agree with me...and everyone else reviewing this album. F*CKING AMAZING."
1,Record is incredible; Amazon's mp3 version is awful!,"I would strongly recommend against the mp3 download version of this record. Most of the parts cut off abruptly, which not only disrupts the flow, but also cuts out some of the music. What should be a single 40 minute song adds up to about 38 1/2 minutes of material when downloaded! The album is fantastic, but the downloadable version is terrible."
5,Gold,"So, I here you say, this album is one song that is forty minutes long, eh? Must get pretty boring, right?HELL NO!This album is one amazing piece of music that demands attention through all forty minutes. It sweeps majestically between riffs and beats as an epic story is growled out before your unbelieving ears. This is a truly inspiring piece of music that anyone who calls themselves a death metal fan must have."
5,Wizard of Oz Snow Globe,I thought the snow globe was beautiful and the details were excellent. If you are interested in snow globes I would recommend this one. Amazon is the best.
2,Ali's love letter to Islam,"I'd say this book is maybe 25% autobiography, and 75% religion, and the narrative is all over the place. I kind of figured the religion aspect would come into play with Ali being a Muslim and all, but I could've done with more of the former, and less of the latter. His life stories and reflections are definitely the most interesting parts of the book, but most of the rest pretty much boils down to 'love everyone and do onto others', so set your expectations accordingly. He may be the greatest of all time, but I don't think that entitles his book to get a free pass.It's a little ironic that while I was reading this, his religion of peace made the news, having been responsible for several recent deaths at the American embassy in Libya, as well as other parts of the world."
2,"come on, people","I thought there'd be at least one negative review for this thing, so I'd better take care of that myself. This was a pretty bad book. I'll go two stars just because he's 'The Greatest of All Time', which, aside from being a gift, was the only thing that kept me reading. It's all god-happy, self-help mumbo jumbo. Again, Ali has the right more than most, but some of his daughter's poetry, and his, was just bad, grade school stuff. The quotes weren't all that thought-provoking. I appreciate the love and spritual devotion, and it could've been more arrogant (but wasn't), but I can't say I got much out of this, and I actually enjoy some self-help type books. I haven't read much about Ali otherwise, so maybe I was expecting more (the entire decade of the '60s was covered it, oh, 2 1/2 pages, if that.) If you want to read about how much Ali loves doing god's work, this is for you. Otherwise stay away."
5,"""Soul of a butterfly""","""All the world's a stage,and all the men and women merely players""said who? William shakespear.I say the world is a boxing ring and we are the fighters, fighting for everything, everyone even ourselves.well knitted by Hana yasmeen Ali ""The soul of butterfly"" reveals the true character of Muhammad Ali, three time world heavy weight champion, who conquered the world with his skills and now conquering it with his wisdom. The book is all about Ali's journey through life, about events that tested him and his virtues, and how everytime he stood by his words like a true fighter."
1,Not worth importing to France.,"This thermos is made with cheap looking plastic. It is roughly made. The glass inside has blemishes in addition to the traditional small circles . It doesn't look great. Given its numerous defects, it is too expensive . And worst of all, it doesn't even keep beverages really hot for 6 hours.And why has it not been made in America in accordance with its touted reputation . This one is even made in China of all things. Here in Europe, most of our thermos pitchers of quality are still made here; and their equivalents have a more sophisticated look, and better, smoother craftsmanship.John EichrodtRetired English TeacherMulhouse, France"
5,FANTASTIC CARAFE,I WAS HESITATE TO BUY THIS CARAFE AFTER READING THE PREVIOUS REVIEW. I LOVE THIS CARAFE AND IT KEPT THE COFFEE HOT FOR 10 HOURS. I AM VERY HAPPY WITH ITEM.
5,Love it!,"How good is this?- HUGE tent. I don't know exact dimensions. But, you can stand up easily in it...and I am 5'9""- I set this up relatively quickly. Can do it with one person...though easier with two.- Quality. It's good. Held up under some rain. Really ideal for good family camping.- Color. The rain fly is more purple than it appears in the photo--which gives you the impression that it's more red. Regardless..- For the size, i haven't seen anything this affordable.I also bet folks will like this in their backyard, as well.Best deal I have found this year. Unbelievable."
4,Pretty Damn Good,For a lesser known band- this ROCKS- all around good production- great songs... im impressed!
5,YOU'VE GOT TO HEAR THIS CD!,"These guys are awesome! Some great talent here. My two favorites are:Entrance Stargate & Dimensions of fire.But I love the whole damn thing. Got it yesterday, and it's the only CD I've listened to since! I hear they're already working on their third album.Can't wait to compare it to THIS release. Got to get their first one now. (Infinity Divine)."
4,Where did this come from?,"I'm glad I heard both Pagan's Mind albums at around the same time, because had I listened to a few tracks from Infinity Divine first, I would have never bothered to check out Entrance. They are polar opposites. This is melodic metal in the vein of Sonata Arctica and I love it. More, MORE!"
4,"Yes, agree, worth a purchase!!!",This is a very good album- with one of the best instrumentals I HAVE EVER HEARD!!!!! Worth it? YOU KNOW IT!!!
2,Queen's Reich?,"Is this Queen's Reich secretly making pagan music??I gave it 2 stars.1 Star because they are attempting to make pagan rock which is good in concept but has similar problems with creativity as does Christian rock.@nd star is for effort.All that said, if you like Queen's Reich and you are pagan, you will LOVE this."
5,I am a bunny!,Book looked like new! I had this book as a child and it brought back so many great memories looking at all the colorful pages! I wish they still made books like these! So glad I found it again!!
5,This is my new go-to gift for parents-to-be. We adore this book!,"My son received this book from a friend when he was born in 2009. From the moment he became interested in books this has been one of his very favorites. He calls it his 'bunny book'. The story is so simplistic - a bunny living in the forest, capturing the fun he has with each passing season. The illustrations are great, and the sentences are easy for a young reader. I'm not sure if you can get this in paperback, but if so I would advise against it. Ours is a board book and is already showing a little wear from so much toddler love. A paperback probably wouldn't stand the test of time as well. We have enjoyed this book so much I now give it to parents-to-be for their own new baby's library."
5,One of the Best Books Ever,"This book is great for kids!! It is just like the old one (I Am a Mouse), which was my favorite as a kid! I would recommend this book to anyone who has a child! It is a must!!"
5,Love it!,Such a sweet little story. It's a quick read and has great pictures. My child squeels in delight at this book.
5,Love this book,This is one of our favorite children's books. So sweet and a good introduction to nature and the seasons. We keep it in the car and read it often.
4,Nice little story,"While this is short, it's cute and sweet. My baby likes looking at all the pictures and we describe what's going on and how many things are in the pictures (flowers, birds, frogs). Cute story, it's a keeper."
4,Wonderful throughout the generations,"This was my favourite book when I was a little boy, and I have treasured it and kept it safe for my own daughter. It still stirs up the emotions in me, and I would recommend it to anyone."
5,Best toddler book ever,"Got this book to replace the previous one we owned, that got lost. The pictures in it are incredible, and we had to replace it because the kids loved it so much! Even as a 6month old, my daughter LOVED to look at all the beautiful photos. And the older toddlers/children still love to look at the pictures. Incredible book, definitely a great gift for any toddler."
5,A classic!,This book's illustrations are absolutely beautiful. My 2-year-old son loves the simple phrases that bring him through bunny Nicholas's journey of the seasons. Highly recommended to children of all ages!
5,13 Years Later & It's Still One Of Her All-Time Favorite Childhood Books!,"I bought this book for my daughter thirteen years ago. She loved it then and asked for me to read it to her every night for years. On trips, my husband and I would recite it from memory to soothe her as we drove. She's thirteen years old now; her beloved book is safely packed away for her children someday, but my daughter still lovingly recites the entire book to me every now and then . . . and it's still one of her very favorite childhood books. Today we're ordering a copy for her cousin's new baby! Another generation needs to enjoy this lovely book.""I am a bunny, my name is Nicholas. I live in a hollow tree . . . .""After all those many, many readings, I still love it, too!"
5,Our baby's favorite book,Our baby was captivated by this book as soon as she could see the illustrations. She's 6 months old now. Reading it to her and letting her look at the pictures calms her down for naps. An absolute must!!!
5,Perfect for 18 month old,"My son loves this book. There are only a few words on each page for his short attention span and the pictures are beautiful. The birds, flowers, insects and animals shown in the book are all actual species as well. It teaches about the seasons."
4,"Wonderful illustrations, decent text","This is one of my 2-year-old's favorite books. In fact, it was the first book she helped order. The illustrations are incredibly good, and the book is worth it for that alone. The text is nothing special, but worth reading."
4,Perfect beginners video for all ages,"Jonh Bright-Fey is a energetic and charismatic instructor who has you having fun as you learn the basics of Tai Chi. Easy to follow, and very basic for the person who has no idea of what Tai Chi is. I was requested to purchase a Tai Chi instruction video by my class of Adults with mental illness and they love the video. We practice three times a week. The unfortunate part is that a few are now ready for the next level, so I need to find another video. HOwever I will use this video for any new student."
1,Tai Chi-verylite,"I am a beginner, & so I have reviewed alot of beginner Tai-Chi dvds lately--and this is definately the worst thing that I have seen; Yes, it is easy to remember but the thing is, that it is not worth remembering. Participants are asked to draw numbers in the air, sometimes adding a wavylegged motion or two; even as a beginner, I think I know that this is nowhere near authentic Tai Chi. It has all the depth of a two o'clock in the morning infomercial, and will require about as much of your attention--I did, however, wake up at one point where Bright-Fey holds up a cardboard Yin-Yang diagram and attempts to expain what it means. The important thing, he expounds in kindergarten teacher vioce, is that ""it's round"". He then chucks this Yin-Yang medallion off stage right, like a frisbee. In short, Bright-Fey knows exactly nothing that I am interested in learning."
2,"Unless you're 80, pass on this one.","Most Tai Chi videos are pretty bad. Either the moves are too intricate, the pace is too fast or the camera is in the wrong place for the spatially challenged. I have owned several and most ended up in the trash.New Forest Tai Chi breaks new ground - it is just plain silly. Essentially, you paint the numbers 1 through 10 in the air with your hands. There! You just learned Tai Chi - Finger Paint Style.But in truth, this might be good for someone with limited mobility and who could care less about ""grasping the bird's tail"". Still, its a little pricey.My recommendation is a VHS tape called Discovering Chi by Linda Modaro. I wish they would re-release this in a DVD format. In my opinion, this is the only one worth owning."
1,Disappointed,"They need to make clear that this is a modified routine, not traditional Tai Chi. I really can't express how unhappy I am with this purchase. I wish I could send it back."
1,Don't Be Scammed Into Getting This Video!,"After seeing such rave reviews and an overall 4.5 stars, I decided to buy this DVD. What a complete waste of money.1. The DVD was obviously made from a poor quality VHS version2. The instructor was annoying, knew nothing about Tai Chi, and he did all of his Tai Chi showing you his back (there was no mirror in front of him, so you just had to guess what he was doing)3. There is no music at all4. There was no Tai Chi done at all! A Tai Chi routine does not consist of drawing 1-10 in the air over and over again. His ""40 minute tai chi workout"" was not a work out, not tai chi, and not even 40 minutes (more like 5 minutes repeated 8 times!)"
1,Don't waste your money painting by numbers,This video is awful! The same steps over and over - painting imaginary numbers in the air; the instructor leads almost the entire routine with his back to the camera; and it has the quality of a cheesy home video.No arguing that it's easy. It's also very irritating.
3,Too Easy,"The instructions on this DVD are really easy to follow and learn. After one run through following along I can do this without ever watching the DVD again. I've never done anything like this before so I learned it all for the first time with this DVD. I like the fact that I learned it quickly because I usually get frustrated quickly and quit, but it left me wanting more. Like, is that all there is? I'm now on a quest for other Tai Chi DVD's that are equally as easy to learn but not leaving me wanting more."
3,Good but disappointing.....,"I purchased this cd hoping for original versions of the songs. They have been re-recorded and NO mention of this is anywhere on the cd. I purchased this for basically one song ""My uncle used to love me but she died""- the only other set this song is on is the Box Set ""King of The Road"". The sound quality is good and it's got all the hits...but just not the versions from the 60's. So if you want the originals don't look to this one. If you're already a fan and want slightly different versions and good photos..pick it up and enjoy."
5,Best so far...,"Out of all the money clips my boyfriend has used, this seems to be the best so far. It is not too big or wide and snap (clips) closed. He will see how many bills he can put in it and how long it holds up for him. I will submit another review in 3 months. Thank you"
5,Brilliant,"I truly believe this has to be the best, honest, biblical research on this topic. It's not a book to read just once, but again and again. This book will not leave you still wondering about: ""how to speak in tongues? and ""why speak in tongues"". Dr. Wierwille shows you straight from the Bible the how and why of receiving holy spirit. A must read for those hungering to know."
5,"Excellent fun read, while still providing great information.","I was given this book by a family member who thought it would be a great educational book for me a first time father. It was! I was feeling a bit out of sync with my wife and it was causing some real communication issues. We both found out a lot about what is consider ""normal"" for the father to be. I was normal afterall but more importantly my wife was able to read it from a third party perspective and understand what I was going though. I would recommend this to any of my family and friends who were expecting. It was great read."
3,"Very good ""bad"" movie, few zombies, few ninjas, good laughs.","Zombie vs Ninja has many other titles in the film, which struck me odd. On the video's label it says ""Zombie Ninja"". In the movie it has both ""Zombies versus the Super Ninjas"" and ""Zombie VS Ninja"". But there are no Romero NOTLD style zombies anywhere to be seen. And there is one ninja at the end. Then there are the (badly edited in) Italian ninjas, who dress like Mighty Morphin Power Rangers. SO MUCH FOR STEALTH! So the bottom line is: No lighting-quick ninjas fighting off hordes of flesh-eating zombies here. Just a HongKong kungfu fest with poorly dubbed Italian actors spliced into it. Although the fights at the end are not too shabby and the humor is quizzical and bizarre, I give it 3 stars."
4,"""Exceptional Eloquence...Exemplary Latin Prose""","Rivalling the great Cicero in sheer eloquence and form, the select letters of St. Jerome are an enduring testimony to an age painted with religious verve and shakened by the piecemeal disentigration of the Roman Empire. These selections are but a mere fragment of Jerome's extant letters; the selections made provide us with important historical content, while at the same time manifesting the personality of the saint - his concern for people, rather than doctrine, is the focus of these letters."
1,ARNOLD COPPER WAS BAMBOOZLED!,"Poor deluded Arnold Copper - he really believed that he was contacting sisters and 'the evil Higgins' on his home-made ouija board!No way, as a clairvoyant and medium of many years standing (as was my mother and both grandmothers) I can state quite categorically that there was no Zena or Beth or 'orrible Higgins. It would have been a gang of nasty lower astral entities that were having a game with these innocent suckers. Stay away from ouija boards. THEY ARE DANGEROUS!"
3,Calypso,"I have always enjoyed the 87th precinct novels and I have read everyone. Calypso is not one of my favourites. The storyline is a little forced and the conclusion somehow is not the usual McBain. As I was determined to read all the 87th precinct novels, it was a must read for me and I am glad I read it and should be if one is a McBain fan as I am."
4,A great guide,Bought this just before at trip to England and worked perfectly over there and really saved me time and frustration. Used it extensively in the US and works great but did have one problem and a long trip. After about 5 hrs / 300 miles it lost its satellite signal. Not sure why as there were no significant hills / mountains / trees around. It refused to find a signal for at least 10 minutes whereupon I had to stop for gas and took the opportunity to reset it. Then it worked fine and no problem on the return journey going the same route in reverse.Definitely a fine piece of equipment and provides that added confidence when travelling in unfamiliar territory.
2,Unit stopped working after just 2 weeks.,"Initially I was impressed by the performance of the Nuvi370. Everything worked great including the bluetooth feature. The Nuvi found the Razr3 whenever it was powered up.About two weeks after later the unit displayed message that there is poor satellite reception and lost the signal and it failed to acquire satellites.Reset the unit a few times but it was never able to acquire satellites any longer.Called Garmin and was on hold for the usual 30 minutes. Explained problem and technician issued RMA number to return the unit for evaluation, repair and/or replacement. The turnaround time is approximately 10-14 days.Hopefully Garmin is repairing this unit or even better will send a replacement unit.We will see."
3,"Garmin nuvi 370 3.5-Inch Bluetooth Portable GPS, North America and European Maps","I was looking for a GPS which works both North America and Europe. When I was happy when I found this in Amazon site especially for the price $240.00 which was offered. This works great in North Americal, but when I took it to Europe it does not work and gives an error sign which reads ""Not enough memory"". I am not trying to give this product to my friend and will buy Garmin 1370T which is getting released in June 2009.How do I register this product. Thanks for listening. Mike"
4,Garmin Nuvi 370,"I have found this product very easy to use, although I discovered a number of routes resulting in dead ends (roads not completed). Good to have maps covering USA and Europe - at a very good price. I recommend a hard case (as it is easy to damage the touch panel if pressed or dropped). Friction mount is more flexible than windscreen mount."
4,I wish it can be mount anywhere else in the car other than windshield,"I like my NUVI 370 with N. America and Europe maps. It's accurate and easy to use. However, I missed:1. Lane assistance, especially on freeway with car pool lanes, and it doesn't advise which lane to use when connect to another freeway.2. California does not allow any GPS to be mounted on windshield, except at the far corners, which is difficult with all the wires etc. I wish Garmin comes out with a mount that can be fixed onto the vent or something else on dash board. The OEMs are either not well made, flimsy or difficult to assemble.3. Speech recognition capabilities so that driver doesn't have to do any touch screen when driving.4. Earlier warning before turns. Now it is too close to turns before the NUVI warns.5. Includes lifetime traffic and map update6. Speedy start when turn on.Perhaps I am expecting too much for a small gadget of this size."
4,"great product, a bit on the expensive side","this thing works great! fast satellite pick up, fast calculation/recalculation. bluetooth is nice to have, able to pick up contacts, etc. from my nokia6133. although its a bit buggy with the txt msg download (at least with my phone). the unit automatically picks up & recognize new incoming msg, but when i click 'review', it hangs. other than that, this unit is great. although i haven't used the mp3 player functionality/european maps."
3,Nuvi 370,"I am a guy who has had GPS for many years now. I have had handhelds since handhelds came out in the late 90's. I have had expereince with the military GPS in the mid/late 80's when the GPS was the entire back of a Hummer!! But I digress. This is about the new Nuvi 370. I dont hate it, but I definately dont love it. It is small, but not compact. The screen is fairly bright, but still is hard to read in bright sunlight. The voice mispronounces ""almost"" everything she reads. You really have to pay attention to what she is trying to say. There is also a flaw in the design as far as it frequently ""thinks"" there is a turn if there is a bend in the road. It will say ""keep left"" for I-10, and this wont make sense to you because I am already on I-10... You dont need more confusion if you are in a new place. I would give this unit a C at best."
2,Wish I had purchased it long ago,I love my Garmin Nuvi 370 and wish I had purchased it long before this. The directions are spoken in a clear voice (with street names) and if you make a wrong turn or start out in a diferent way it recalculates the directions quickly. It is also bluetooh compatible for hands free talking which is a plus for me because I make a lot of calls from the car. I will be trying out the European maps in Dec. when I take it to Germany and am excited about that. I love that it is small and lightweight so I can just drop it in my purse. Don't worry about putting it through xray when going through airport security.........I've done it and everything was fine.
5,Excellent,I am in Italy and the time I have had to use the Garmin was excellent. I hope it can continue to be of excellent use.
1,First try in San Diego,"I tried it in San Diego for the first time and it could not find the Hilton San Diego Bayfront, even with address typed in. Not good. The touch screen and user interface are not very straight forward. Think twice before you get this model."
3,Broke my heart,"I bought this to send with my wife and niece on a road trip from Florence to Barcelona. My wife has had another Garmin unit for years. We used the Nuvi 370 in L.A. It was balky until we updated it, then it was fine. Just before the trip, I loaded photos and songs on it. VERY BAD IDEA. DON'T USE ANY INTERNAL MEMORY. It gave memory errors in Europe and would never, ever work. Never, ever acquired a satellite. Thought it was still in L.A. Very, very big disappointment. When they got home, I tried it and it would not acquire a satellite, even after 20 minutes. On a hunch, I deleted all the photos and songs. Now it works fine. I did not see this documented anywhere, and I am kind of a geek.It was awfully slow to load photos, and did not sound good. So you are not missing anything. If you want to use these features, try using an SD card, and you might need to take the card out when you are navigating.The sandbag holder works great in L.A. They never needed it in Europe."
5,Excellent Product,"We just returned from a 3 week driving trip in Portugal, Spain, France and Holland. THIS IS AN EXCELLENT PRODUCT. Also, very easy to operate. It never let us down and took us door to door from Barcelona to Paris and from Paris to my uncles driveway in Amsterdam. Unbelievable!! I've read the other reviews and did not experience any of those issues. MP3 player is weak...the optional Language guide was useful, especially in Portugal...I recommend the portable friction mount (no suction cups = less theft chance)....Bluetooth reception was pretty good (could be improved). Overall, I highly recommend this Nuvi."
4,European Vacation,"Made a 5,000 km trip around Europe much easier. There were times that we wouldn't have found our destination without the Nuvi. There were only a few times that we just couldn't follow what it was trying to tell us to do."
5,Garmin NUVI 370,"Great GPS. Easy to use. Clear turn by turn instructions. Acquires satellite signal usually without much delay. For those of you who does a lot of driving to new places, I strongly recommend this GPS."
4,"Great product, great price!","This is a great product. It is far more accurate than others we have tried. The bluetooth works well with the cell phone for hands-free communication. Be careful, the bluetooth will work if you leave it turned on in the car, but take your cell into a nearby building. Only real complaint is the sound quality of the navigation voices. Still understandable, but fuzzy."
4,"Love it, but could be improved","The product is a life saver if you want to get away from printing maps and if you want to never worry about not finding your way around. Here is a summary:What I like:1. Ease of use - quite straightforward, very driver friendly2. Options - inserting mid-points in your route, changing the view of the map, so you can browse it3. Hotels, bars, etc - extremely helpful to be able to find hotels and bars when you are traveling4. Screen - big and readableWhat I don't like:1. Updates - this is not an issue with the product per se, but rather with Garmin. The updates for the maps are quite expensive.2. Holder - broke soon after I bought it. The new one form Garmin is so lame that now I can't put it on my windshield AND have the antena in the best position for receiving signal? Garmin designers - do you try to coordinate your products ever?Overall, it is a good product, but there is a lot to be desired from Garmin."
3,Garmin has done better with older models.,"For may years I have used Garmin GPS electronics sailing across the Gulf of Mexico, the Bahamas, and Cayman Islands and I love the equipment. I also own the portable Palm 360 model as well as a few older models for automotive use in the the US and Europe. I did not think twice about ordering the Nuvi but, I truly regret it. No software to back up or insert waypoints is such a skimp! Shame on Garmin for a less than great product as they have in the past! Quick to pick up satelites but slow to react to straying from original route and Jill needs a pronouncing lesson that she could get from her predesessor..."
2,Slow and not user-friendly,"I chose garmin over tom tom due to good reviews before i bought this product. Though, I'm disappointed. I have it set to ""fastest route"" and it gave me local streets than highway (which is faster, because I've tested). It's just not a very ""smart"" gps if you have high expectations, then you'll be real disappointed with this purchase. I'm thinking about returning it to amazon."
1,Garmin GPS 370 Navigator,"Although the product is listed as one of the best, my husband used it less than 2 weeks and it kept on losing its satellite signal. The company was gracious in paying for the shipping costs to return it, but we made it very clear that we do not want a used product. I bought this product supposedly new from Amazon and we want another new GPS. This incident made me a little shy from using Amazon for electronics again. Other than that, it is great for its portability, not so much on accuracy, but I guess we aren't there yet technologically. GPS still beats paper maps."
5,Garmin Nuvi 370 GPS Navigator,"We call her EMily (the British female voice option) and she was worth every penny on our recent 2 weeks in England. When missing a turn in a roundabout, she calmly redirects you to your final destination. We used her to find some geocaches as well. The pedestrian mode is weird, as it doens't update your location on the map but continues to demonstrate your starting point. Battery life is somewhat limited, but I didn't find it dying while on any 2-3 hour hikes when I put the screen timeout on 15 seconds. The traffic info hasn't been useful. When driving on I-95 in Florida, I got info on roads far away and not on my route. THough it comes with a free UK subscription, it didn't seem to work there (needs to be activated?) Love the portability, MP3 player, but the photo display isn't used much. Don't have cell phone so bluetooth useless."
3,"Okay, but could be a lot better","I've had my Nuvi 370 for about a month. I also have a Lowrance iWay 500C. The Nuvi is excellent for someone who always uses a device as-is out of the box. If you want to customize the display, you're mostly out of luck as few features can be changed by the user. My personal dislikes are the unchangable display of the useless and inaccurate ""arrival time"" and the lack of any way to modify the types of information displayed. Also, the text size and location of information on the screen can't be modified. The Lowrance allows the user to pick and choose items to display and allows the text size to be changed. The one advantage of the Nuvi is that it's size and weight make it easily carried in a shirt pocket."
1,Terrible reception,"I had high hopes for this unit based on the reviews, especially for a trip to Europe and the Pacific I planned.The unit never got a signal in Germany for 3 days. When i arrived in Hawaii, it took forever to acquire a signal, then lost it at underpasses. In Miami and Tampa it took forever to get a signal leaving the airport.The call to take exits comes way too close to the turn. And the display doesn't offer enough detailed info (arrival time, total distance, etc.)Go with Tom Tom"
4,My 5th GPS,"This is my 5th GPS. I bought it because I want the European Map. Everything works as expected and better than my three previous Garmin units. However, there are at least two things that can be improved. First, the text-to-speech sound is very tinny and not loud enough if you are over sixty years old or your radio is playing. Next, it cannot pronounce Spanish names correctly. This is very annoying living in Southern California. It will be fun when I go to France or Germany. By the way, if you want a lot of POI, you will be disappointed. In my opinion, Garmin has never been great on POI, but they excel on the important things on navigation."
3,Only as good as the maps,"The garmin nuvi pocket is an great device, but it is as only good as the maps. We bought it for purposes of a trip in Europe. It was fine on the main roads, but we had some strange experiences on lesser roads, as it had us making some strange turns that anyone who lived in the area would know not to do. We found that off the main roads we could not rely on it by itself, and someone had to take a look at a real map as well as use the garmin. If you generally know what you are doing, and where you are going it can be quite helpful, but it is not wise to rely on it by itself. At night, when we stuck to main roads and could not read the maps, the garmin was lit up and very useful."
1,Problems with satellites reception on Garmin Nuvi 370,Bought this Nuvi 370 March 2007. Worked fine just out of the box for 3 months. Then it started to malfunction and not receive satellites. Garmin replaced it with a reconditoned one. Out of the box the keybord of the second one was not working. Sent it back at my expenses and received a third one. Worked fine for 4 months and AGAIN stopped receiveing signal from satellites. I think they have a problemwith the receiving unit and Garmin is not admitting it. Hopefully my 4th will be OK. I am close to the end of my warranty. If it goes bad I will not buy an other Garmin.
1,disappointed in Amazon,I was shipped a referbed unit sold as new. After years of good service from Amazon I was disappointed and returned it. The unit itself is a great GPS. Bought the same thing from another vendor
1,Bad suction cup,"I am very disappointment with this product. I owned an old model of garmin (2720). That one worked well but just not looked too bulky for my new car. So I bought the garmin nuvi 370 for its sleek look and the potential to work in Europe. However, the basics are not good. The suction cup lost it suction capacity after only a few times of usage."
5,Spectacular for learning advanced mathematics,"This is a tremendous book for those of us who struggle with mathematics. It makes complex topics feel like a simple string of easy steps. This book is also a great reference; mine is severely dog-eared and has tabs at all the sections that I use often. My friends who are (in my opinion) expert mathematicians don't care for this book as much as I do, but for the ""expert novice"" like myself, I find this book invaluable.One of the topics in this book that I find very useful is the numerical methods section. Excellent for a reference when reading and reviewing numerical data or when generating simple code."
5,Heartwarming True Account of a Free Spirit,"Wonderful tribute to a special person, Jeff, who touched so many lives in a positive, unforegettable short lifetime. It was clear to see how much he is loved by family and friends and what a profound affect he had on everyone he met. Talented young musician who was encouraged to persue his dreams by loving parents."
3,Not too bad....,My favorite song on the album is Simplesmente and (Aganjú the version on the 2nd disk that comes with the album).
5,Bebel + bossa nova + electronica = another hit!,"I've been listening to Bebel Gilberto since her first record came out around 2000 and I've bought all her albums since. If you look at the above equation you should get a pretty good idea of what this record is all about. Most tracks are very danceable and a few are more ambient. Some of the included tracks are a little weak, which I would have given 4 stars, but since the bonus disc brings the track total to 19 (with 4 impressive mixes of Aganjú) I'm giving it 5. If you are a fan of modern bossa nova, electronic/dance music, or really hot sounding female singers, you will like this."
3,Pretty good!,"It's definately different from what our American ""remixes"" are like-- which is kind of what I was expecting-- but I do like it. Great musician."
5,The miracle feather,Excellent overview of the history of CDC and examples of its current usage and relevance to modern fly fishermen. There is a great deal more that can be usefully done with CDC's both as surface and sub-surface material than most trout fishermen are aware of. Great photography and interesting text.
3,Audrey Hepburn: Always a pleasure,"The world lost a treasure when Audrey Hepburn died. Fortunately we are lucky to have her spirit and personality available to us on DVD. ""Love Among Thieves"" is a familiar plot and therefore predictable. However, the chemistry between Robert Wagner and Audrey Hepburn makes this made for TV film worth seeing. This film is not her best work but it does give us another opportunity to experience the rare, ethereal quality we associate with Audrey."
5,Enhoyable Audrey,"Fast service on a rare Audrey Hepburn film, a comedy with Robert Wagner. Enjoyable !"
2,A fault in the dvd film.,This dvd film plays well for about 40 minutes then you have a major cut. You can't just press ffw because it's stuck. You'll have restart the film and when you're almost at the cut you'll have to go ffw four times the speed to get past it and when you rewind be sure not to go too much or you'll get stuck again.I'm sorry to say I'm not satisfied.
5,Wish there was MORE!,"This has to be ( other then the cold,cold hand ) the BEST book in my collection! I cant highly recomend it enough! Get it trust me YOU wont be able to put it down you will be HOOKED!!!!!!!!!!"
2,"Stories with little suspense, no plot","""Ghosts and Haunts from the Appalachian Foothills"" is not really a book of short stories per se. Its narratives are the literary equivalent of a Grandma Moses painting: a moment of time in rural America. Most of the narratives of ghostly encounters are charming, but not very frightening, because there is no evocation of tension or suspense. The first story in the book is probably the scariest because it is one of the few that does build up to supernatural climax. One of my favorite stories is about a guardian spirit who warns his human if there is speed trap on the road ahead. Another is about an old woman who made a pact with the devil, so that she could spy on her neighbors through a flour sifter.At any rate, although this book did not really haunt me or frighten me in any way, you may be charmed by its tales of rural Appalachia."
1,Written Too Soon,"It was difficult to get through this book. While no fault of the prose, it just seemed too soon for this writer to tackle the subject from a biographical standpoint.The insights and personal revelations therefore had a more superficial, anecdotal feel rather than the wisdom and depth that I had expected. I wish he had waited until he himself was further along; just as that fellow who wrote ""A Million Little Pieces"" could have waited, and we would have been spared all that flap about authenticity."
1,Plastic crystal,"I was disappointed to find this model watch has a soft plastic crystal that scratched the first day I wore it to work. I work around stainless steel and sharp tools. I did return the watch because the description stated the crystal was mineral. Amazon promptly refunded my money. Nice watch, I stand by CASIO watches. I have had many. This watch just wasn't rough enough for my abuse."
2,Easily scratched,"Window sticks out the case. Therefore it is easy to scratch the window. My friend bought different color but the problem is the same. Other than that, I did not have any problem with the watch so far."
2,Wrong band on watch!,I like the watch but the one I was ordering had a different band and the one I received is ok. I like the watch it does what I wanted it to do I was just disappointed that it didn't match the picture.
3,GOOD WATCH WITH LOTS OF FUNCTIONS AT A NOMINAL PRICE,Good watch with lots of functions.But temperature shown on the watch differs from the actuals.If the same model is available in a rectangular shape would look more better (My idea)
3,ridiculously complex to set up for tides and moon phase,"Love the watch, love all of its features. I purchased the watch because I wanted to have the moon phase and tides for boating season. In order to properly set up the moon and tide graphs you need to know how to compute the lunitide interval. NOT EASY. I managed to figure it out after getting moon up times and the next following high tide for my location but only after adjusting for DST.......are you getting the picture??? Also the temperature gauge is cute, but do we really want to know what the temperature of your wrist is? Still all in all, I like the watch because I have finally figured out how to set up the moon/tide phase, not accurate but kind of close, and its such a reasonable price that it was still worth it for me."
3,Operational Instructions,"If was asked to set the alarm I would have to consult the book. If I was to set the time, I would have to read the manual. You realy have to carry around the manual sometimes with this watch. Its some getting use too."
3,"Historically interesting, but not the essence of Fats","Collections of piano roll recordings often sound stiff by the end of the CD, and this one is no exception. These recordings are all pleasing to the ear and are classic instances of stride piano blues, but they all seem to lope along at the same leisurely pace and none are particularly distinctive. Though they are of historical interest, they don't show the wonderful flair and distinctive musicianship of Fats' later solo studio recordings. For a much better introduction to his solo playing, try the great Turn On the Heat compilation. The Associated Transcriptions also have some marvelous solos mixed in with the group recordings."
5,LOVE THIS BOOK!!,"This book was entertaining, hilarious, and extremely true to life for single women of all races. I could totally relate to all of those characters! I have been some of all of them at different times in my life. I read this book straight though and almost never put it down. It was so funny that I found myself laughing out loud, which I almost NEVER do when reading a novel...even if I find it funny! I would recommend this book to everyone!!! :-)"
3,"Not bad, not particularly good either.","This effort is a first one for the author and one can tell that it is the work of a neophyte. The narrative chuggs along all too predictably toward the obligatory and unsurprising ""twist"" at the end. In short, there is not enough that is fresh about it and all too much that is callow.If you find this as a paperback in your laundromat or in the seat of an airplane, read it. Otherwise save your money and buy something...anything by Lee Child. You'll be much more satisfied."
5,Wow! and then some!,"Wow! What a great read. Quickly set aside the fact that this is a young writer; forget that this was a first novel. Instead, sit back to read, prepared to spend the next few hours fixed on this work.Simply put: exciting.More complexly put: the writer reminds me of the Nelson DeMille style: great characters, enough description to allow you to ""see"" the people, dialogue that is real and, ala DeMille, interlaced with unexpected and welcome humor, good story line.My advice is this: If you can, buy a first edition, get is signed and hold on to it. This is going to be worth money.My next bit of advice is this: be alert to the next novel from this gentleman. I know I'm buying a copy (first edition, of course).You are not going to be sorry you read this work -- unless, of course, you have some neuro-surgery to do in the morning. In that case you need to accept that you're going to be up until you finish it."
1,a disappointment,"I read one damning revue of this book, by R.T.""robert2323"", and I only wish I had seen that before buying it. It is indeed a very poorly written book and terribly amateurish. I felt like Dorothy Parker: ""This is not a book to be taken lightly, it is to be thrown across the room with great force"".I cannot understand the prize, nor the gushing reviews. I am a big reader of mysteries and always hoping to discover new authors. This one is a miss. Maybe he will eventually get better..."
3,Overlook the obvious,"A detailed procedural, that ignores a basic principal, but you barely catch that, to eventually come back. An author to watch."
5,Great writing. Good Story.,"Good story, well told. I've read all of Koryta's books; he is great writer, lets story unfold in original ways."
3,Nice story but . . .,"I liked the story, the characters, all that; but the fictional illusion was broken when I read about how a character took the safety off his Glock. Glocks have two internal ""drop"" safeties and a third safety integrated into the trigger. I'm willing to forgive that, maybe the author originally had the character using a 1911 and switched to a Glock at the last minute. But when the magazine was described as a clip, well, that was the last straw. To me this is a violation of basic fact checking.But I did like the story."
4,Almost there--but....,"I gave this four stars because I am always delighted to find a promising new mystery writer. At 21 years this is a remarkable achievement, BUT it isn't, to me, as great as many reviewers think it is. A notable first effort that promises great ones to come. I enjoyed it very much and was also annoyed at times at the pace-the hot tub sex scene seemed thrown in-something just seemed to be lacking. Know this is vague. Read it by all means, and the advice of buying a first edition is probably good advice."
3,First Perry/Pritchard Novel,"Not bad for a first noel and I will read the second, but TONIGHT I SAID GOODBYE never quite made it with me. Needed a little more passion, a little more action. THe basis is here and this book is an Edgar Award Finalist but I just expected a little more."
5,fascinating read,"couldn't put it down...such a different perspective of any civil war accounts that I have ever read...that of the common nameless, faceless foot soldier...the day to day drudgery of marching, the hunger, the boredom... all sandwiched between unspeakable horrors of the battlefield...I found it fascinating..."
5,Great insight from the common solider,"While this book is not for the beginner Civil War reader it is a must have for those that want to understand just how it must have been. Along with ""All for the Union"" ""Bayonet's forward"" and other Company level collections.This is an editted version and has cleaned up some of the grammer and errors per the author.Further the text presumes that the reader knows what is going on and makes scant reference to the common names for the battles he fought in or other forms of reference, hence the not for the casual reader comment earlier."
4,Great insight to a Private Soldier's Civil War,"This is a first-hand account of Civil War life and battles as exprienced by a private in the C.S.A. Army, Sam Watkins. Watkins explains throughout that he is NOT a historian nor should his writings ever be considered history. But, if you want to know what went on in the minds of those young men, then this is a must read. I bought this one after browsing through a friend's book, Company Aytch by Sam Watkins, and I recommend this one as it does contain additional writings (sketches) by Watkins as well as a glossary of definitions, which I found necessary. Thomas Ingle does not edit nor rewite Watkin's writings but simply includes additional material. Also, this edition has been fixed of all previous typos."
4,"Like ""Cliff's Notes,"" but....not.","Thomas' ""Guide"" is more of a ""Guide?"" for the beginning scripture scholar. It was helpful for me, having taken introductory classes to both the Hebrew and Christian Scriptures, to have on hand as a review. I'll admit to using it in a pinch (but only once or twice!) to prepare for a discussion or debate when there wasn't enough time {ahem} to complete the book in question. ""Every Catholic's Guide"" is a thorough and reliable sourcebook for the armchair- or weekend- theologian, and a student's tried-and-tested companion... but don't tell anyone!"
3,"Good product, a little clumpy",The taste is pretty good and it does the trick as a meal replacement but when you get towards the bottom you get clumps. Tried shaking them but it doesn't work.
3,Drop Dead Diva: the complete second season,"I do luv the show and the dvd but I find I had the same episodes twice on this dvd , not just once there was a few of them"
5,love this series!,"Brooke Elliot has a tough role to play but she makes it believable. I mainly got it to see more of April Bowlbys work(from Two and a Half Men)and while she also plays a ditzy character on this show, she has flashes of brilliance that helps out her pal Jane. Also love seeing parts played by Liza Minnelli, Delta Burke, Cybil Shepard and many more!"
3,Show is great. Price was not.,They have the first season on Netflix so I bought one episode but would rather wait until season 2 comes to Netflix!Netflix still has the market for instant view TV shows.
2,Barely any markets listed,"I was deeply disappointed when I received this book, for one thing I had mistaken it for the Writer's Digest Markets which always satisfies with thousands of real markets and all the info one needs to sell their work.Not so with Writer's Handbook--it is more concerned with telling you HOW to write! Telling the obvious & calling it helpful. It only includes 3000 markets at best (and repeats quite a few which would probably cut the 3000 almost in half). So if you need to know how to write, this might help, if you want to know WHERE TO SELL, this is NOT the book for you. Instead try Writer's Market 2001."
1,Worst game made for DS.... so far,"Mindless and repetitive, this is the perfect example of phoning-in a block buster movie video game tie in. They don't even manage to translate the voice bubble dialog into English correctly.A major on-line computer gaming site gives this game one-half of one star out of five and says it's better as a prop for your window than it is a game.If you want a good film-to-game comic adventure get Spiderman III for the DS instead."
1,"Batteries, V2 Power Chip",Eddie Bauer E-Light LED FlashlightComes with batteries but they are an odd size and Eddie Bauer did not tell me where I can get replacements.
4,Simple Joys,"Making Room for Joy is fun to read yet full of fundamentals on how to put more joy into one's daily life.Susan Colantuano has found a way to take concepts others make complex and reduce them down to simple basics. Truly, this book will help the reader learn how ""...to stop and smell the roses"". It's a book to read over and over again, either in its entirety or in pieces!"
3,Metal Blade does it again,"Realizing that the ""30+ metal head who still clings to their King's X collection"" demographic has been drastically underserved (hey - they have money now), Metal Blade decided to unleash yet another formulaic cleanly produced power metal album on the masses. Symphorce - an amalgamation of the words ""symphony"" and ""force"", get it? - has boldly arrived on the scene to spread their music to audiences who will pay $... for a concert T-shirt and attend the next Dio show in a vain attempt to recapture their youth. They get bonus coolness points for the mixed-case album title ""phorcefulAhead""."
4,Good Value,This does everything it advertises. Very simple and functional. Could be built a little smaller. Would purchase again.
2,good for the money,"Haven't had the receiver long enough to detail it,about 2 weeks, but sound is not as great as I expected.My old receiver which is about 15 years, had more clerity but for the money,I guess it will do for now."
1,Remember the expression......you get what you pay for!,"In a word...disappointing. On phono input, the treble is fine, but if you're looking for any kind of bass, two dixie cups and a string would work as well. If you're thinking of purchasing this item...set your expectations LOW."
3,Receiver,This was a good value for the money. Clear sound. Only one problem for me was that you cannot turn the volume down as low as I would like.
1,"Nice looking, sound atrocious . . . .","I've had TEAC products in the past, so I had no reservations about choosing the AG-790 to replace a Pioneer receiver for my home stereo system. After getting it hooked up, I noticed that using both speaker systems (A&B) together actually attenuated the overall audio output. Speaker A sounded great, as did Speaker B, but together was bad news. I tried all sorts of tricks to get the system to sound like it should both inside the house and outside, to no avail. I was also testing Radio Shack's Sherwood system at the same time (same price range) and its problem is some safety cutoff mechanism that sends the system to standby due to over modulation, over heating, never have figured it out. I need this type of receiver to accommodate a phone input. So I am back searching for an ideal receiver."
2,Disappointed,"Had a previous TEAC receiver (10 years+ old) and was satisfied with its sound reproduction, but it was underpowered for my new Sony speakers so I purchased this unit to get the higher power output.Maybe it's the newer chip circuitry, but to me the sound quality is terrible. The sound is ""muddy"" and not at all pleasing to listen to. I even tried a third amplifier to be sure it wasn't just my hearing going bad. Nope. This unit is badly lacking in crystal clear sound quality.Would have to say I am really disappointed. If you are interested in clear sound, go with another manufacturer."
4,Teac AG-790A Stereo Receiver review,"It does what I expect it to do with no problems. It is inexpensive and so lacks some features, but I am very satisfied with it."
3,"Receiver fine, remote no good.","I bought a refurbished TEAC AG-790A Stereo receiver from J&R Music World through Amazon. I am pleased with the receiver, but the remote contol does not work properly. I called J&R about it, and they told me to contact TEAC and they would send a new remote directly to me. When I called TEAC, they said that they would sell me one for about $35, but that otherwise I was out of luck. I again called J&R about this, and they said that they would contact TEAC and have them send me the new remote at no cost. After waiting 5 or 6 weeks without a remote, I called J&R for a status. They said they would check it out and call me back. When they did call back, they said that they couldn't help me with a new remote after all. They did say that they would credit my account for $20. That's okay, but I'd rather have the working remote that would complete the unit. The bottom line is that I would not buy anything refurbished from J&R again.."
5,This is great,This was everything I expected and more! Good heavens! I am very happy and listen to it everyday and it works with all the stuff I have plugged into it.
3,TEAC AG-790A Stereo Receiver - Poor volume control,Unit does everything it claims except can not reduce the sound volume to the level I desire. It seem to have a factory preset low volume level and it can not be reduced below that preset level. Turning the volume level below that preset turns the sound off. It does not respond like an old analog tuner. I like low volume level when reading and this can not be achieved with this unit.
3,Teac ag 709 review,"Decent receiver at a good price. I like the one button station preset feature. It pulls in farther away stations better than than the unit that preceded it(at a much higher price many years ago). It also pulls in AM for listening to any talk shows i might want to listen to( I know, I'm showing my age). With a simple aftermarket cable($20.00 +/-) I am able to play my Ipod through the rear AUX port. Sounds pretty clean and can put out some volume."
5,Just what I needed. :),"This book is exactly what i needed. I'm about 1/2 way through it now and have really enjoyed it. It has comforted me on many levels that a surfaced daily devotional could not. The book is written by an every day, down to earth, perhaps a bit random and dramatic woman. She quotes statistics and scripture occasionally throughout the book and does a great job of making me feel like it's ok to feel the way I feel."
5,A good stamp pad,"This is a great ink pad. I had bought my 3 yr old grandaughter a stamp set made by Melissa & Doug but the ink pads that came with it were all dried up which was very disappointing. However, this pad works great! I like that they come in several different colors and they also have scents. Now my grandaughter enjoys using all of her different stamps. I plan to purchase other colors as well."
3,Just ok...,"The stamp pad is a nice quality, however as far as the grape scent goes, I don't smell it. A few of my students claim they can, but I think it's just because they REALLY want to! ;)"
2,horrible,The book is not well organized. The dates jump around making it confusing to follow the history of it. I have seen the newest version and notice that it is much better organized than this version.
2,Falls a bit short.,"Rarely does one find a book concerning the Cuban Revolution in which the author at least makes an effort to keep there political views out of the analysis. Marifeli Perez-Stable is no exception, as her book will either be praised by the left, or critizied by the right. In writing such a biased account her credibility is jepordized; not only because anyone with half a brain will realize this, but anyone with limited study in regards to the revolution see's many flaws. Amongst the most prevelant is the complete neglect of Cuba's ""Counterculture"" and the booming tobacco industry in Cuba throughout the 50's (she harbors on sugar as if every Cuban was either a plantation owner or slave). Hopefully Cuban books in the future will steer clear of political biases and present the facts, and only the facts."
2,Inadequate and Biased,"Despite attempts to keep an open mind, I grew increasingly annoyed at the omissions, exaggerations and half-truths passed off as researched facts in this book. The author calls Cuba - a country under a dictator which holds no elections - a ""democracy"" and extols the virtues of the revolution without ever presenting the views and the injustices perpetrated against those who opposed the revolution. It is a shame that a work which could have been an objective scholarly book instead is little better than a propaganda pamphlet."
3,Elementary,"This book provides a very elementary introduction to Heraldry. The basic layout of a Coat of Arms is discussed, including a very brief history, along with the rules of placement and description for the major elements. The author also includes some discussion of the prevailing Heraldry of countries around the world, including medieval countries. The appendixes include elements for the user to trace or imitate when creating their own Coat of Arms. Lastly there is some contact information for organizations involved with Heraldry.The book lacks depth. It provides nothing resembling an exhaustive list of elements; only a few basic forms and styles are covered. Further there is nil discussion concerning the meaning of the elements presented. The most a reader can learn is that crowns and lions rampant are symbols of Royalty, and some of that we have to infer. The work feels directed to early middle school children and should probably be marked as Young Reader."
4,Enjoyable and Informative.,"Rosemary A. Chorzempa's 'Design Your Own Coat of Arms: An Introduction to Heraldry' is an enjoyable and informative book, full of crisp, detailed black and white sigils for the many, many, many houses and bloodlines out there.While I found it to be informative, it did read a bit slow, and I had trouble staying with it til the end. My son - no interest in it at all.Still, my ADD is my short coming, not the books, and so I still gave it high marks for originality and enjoyability. Based on a previous review I read here, I liked the idea of utilizing this book to create a themed birthday party with its information.It also has served me well whilst painting my collection of medieval miniature soldiers,Nice. Not thrilling. But Nice."
3,Better for older children,"In this book there is more historical information, and descriptions. Great for older children that can draw well."
4,Coat of Arms,I think the book is very reader friendly and will be lots of fun to work with children with. I cant wait for the next boy bday party that I host.
3,Well....,"Well...to those that like to bash the Left behind series and call it unbiblical, I wonder where they got that idea from. Truth is there are many theories and opinions about end-time ideas. There is a bit of biblical evidence for all of the theories, but I would have to say that this theory statesd in this book has the least amount of evidence and makes the least amount of sense. Yes the left behind series is very commercialized, I agree with that...but it doesnt mean that the ideas are not biblical. It is actually very biblical based and I believe LaHaye's follow up books, support that. As for this book. He supports himself well,so I give him 3 stars."
5,the answer I have been looking for,"I had always known chi is the key to health and longevity. However, the myriad of chi cultivating systems out there usually sound so complicated that I am put off by them. This program is simple, effective and easy to learn. Highly recommended!"
4,"More Than 18,000 Movie Entries - Amazing","This movie guide has more than 18,000 entries, including over 300 new entries and more than 13,000 video (VHS) and more than 7,000 DVD listings. That is the good news. The downside is that the information on each movie is very brief. That is OK though, as you can look the movie up on Amazon.(Mt Laurel)"
2,not good for international movies,i used to buy this every year but i now buy the superior timeout guide.theres just too many mistakes on some of my favourite films.leonard maltin is way overated.for most hollywood films its fine but when it comes to international movies it struggles
2,Overreaching ambitions,"2 1/2There would be at least one track plus several segments of which prog-heads would be thankful tracking down this unique-but-not-special-enough release that does in fairness have some ambitious ideas to contribute in an oft-stale neo-prog lexicon, if mired in second rate production and awkward translations."
3,Good once you get them in.,"Well I went ahead to install these and after trying desperately for about 2 hours on the first one to get it to go on I gave up and took an angle grinder to my frame to get some room. After about 20 minutes of grinding I was able to finally get it onto my 1994 Honda Del sol. Same thing went for the passenger side. It was such a pain, but they feel good once they're in. I should probably go back and re-torque them now though to make sure they're in all the way."
2,Useless for me,"This book is about how to use Windows TAPI to implement JTAPI. The author decided to use Microsoft's J/Direct which is incompatible with Sun's Java VM. So if you want to use SUN's Java 2, this book won't help you much.Also this book contains too much filler material; it can lose about 2/3 of pages.Consider buying JTAPI implementation instead of wasting your money on this book."
4,Great starter for magicians,"This is a great starter set for an aspiring magician. Rather than buy a magic kit that relies on cheap plastic doodads that feel more like toys than magic, get them this book, which will teach children how to practice stagecraft using items from around the house.The book lays out some simple guiding principles that all magicians should know, and then gives detailed and clear instructions about how to pull off enough tricks for an at-home magic show.This is a perfect first step for any child who wants to get serious about magic."
3,Not the best,"This sight is good. It really made me think I was in a movie or something. It is easy to use and easy to mount. problems I had with it were that more often than not, i was playing in light too light to see the red dot and when I was in darker light it was a great way to show people where I was.It is more of a novelty than an item that you will want to use to play."
3,Beautiful but costly,"Portmeirion makes nice dishes. No one can argue with that. When my son and daughter-in-law committed to Portmeirion Dusk by putting it on their wedding registration at Bed, Bath & Beyond, they had no idea that BB&B was about to discontinue it and that any subsequent additions to their collection would have to come with the expense of importing it. They didn't get the full set at their wedding, and I've been paying through the nose to supplement it at Christmastime every year since. The actual cost is about the same as other similar ""good china"", but the cost of bringing it over the Atlantic to America jacks the price up well beyond what it's worth. For that price, you can get better china at home. (Unless you live in the UK.) So--five stars for quality, 1 star for price = 3 star rating."
5,SOFT BABY FOR BOY,"MY GRANDSON GETS SO MAD THAT HIS SISTERS DON'T LET HIM PLAY BABIES, HE'S ONLY 3-BUT WITH THIS BABY BOY DOLL, HE FEELS PROUD- AND HAPPY THAT HE CAN BE PART OF THE FUN. HIS SISTERS CAN PLAY MONSTER TRUCKS BUT HE CAN'T PLAY BABIES, WELL NOT ANY MORE. THE DOLL IS SOFT, HAS WONDERFUL FEATURES LIKE THE BELLY BUTTON AND JUST SO CUDDLEY. AND CUTE TOO!"
4,It's a baby doll,"My wife purchased this doll for my 1.5 yr old son because we wanted to teach him how to be gentle with a baby (we are expecting another bundle of joy). Interestingly, we have also the doll to help get him to stop using his pacifier and become more interested in changing his diaper.There is nothing special about it, but it is what it says it is."
5,This is a great doll!,This toy is great. My daughter loves it so much. It is soft so does not hurt her when she is playing with it. It is a great first baby doll
5,Perfect for a baby,Bought this as a first baby doll for 3 grandkids all under the age of 1. It's so soft and cuddly. Just perfect for the real babies to grab and hug and love on. Really liked the fact that I could find a baby boy doll for my grandsons. Not an easy task.
4,A Very Good Read,"A book with lively characters, with a strong story line, with fans of ""The Golden Compass,"" with lots of fun British slang---what more could you ask for?""Child X"" is a well-written book, although the story line seemed a bit predictable to me. I could tell what was coming with the divorce, when the main character just couldn't understand why her dad was gone. But I must say, there was a great twist at the end (that I won't give away!) that surprized me and a happy ending after all. Jules is a character with a lot of spunk and a cheeky British vocabulary, which makes the book fun to read and balances out the predicibility factor.I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this book--just not to older teens who will see through the plot right away."
2,Disapointing,"I read Child X expecting a little more than more plot.I found that the main character running from photographers was less than thrilling. It also had a less than trilling ending. I think that it would have been better if I had read ""Northern Lights"" it is referred to all through out the book.I have to say I would not recommend this book"
5,mathamadics made simple,i have had a bunch of math classes that used thies therioeys before but never had anyone explained it to me like this before. very easy to read and understand.
4,A nice treatment of a difficult and interesting subject,"I have taken a lot of math, up to the advanced undergrad level, but not much on this development of set theory, though I have come across it quite a bit in my reading. I found the book quite approachable, though I don't claim to be a great judge of the author's approach to a difficult subject and how it compares to other material on the subject. I was just happy to (sort of) get it.I confess that the whole notion of the infinite fascinates me."
2,Preposterous,"This is the second in the Sisterhood series. The Sisterhood being 7 female vigilantes that have been wronged by the American justice system. I enjoyed the first one, but this one was ridiculous. First of all, I had a hard time believing that a local lawyer is going to actually sell most everything he owns and take a month leave of absence from his prestigious job just to spy on these women. Jack is a very annoying character and if he is in the other books, I may not bother to read them. Anyway, this edition of the Sisterhood is about exacting revenge for Julia, a doctor married to a philandering senator that gave her AIDS. There was no real tension or suspense leading up to the vengeful moment and the outcome was ridiculous and displeasing. Are we really to believe that a bunch of HMO people were just secretly spririted to Africa and hypnotized and forced to work on a farm? Get real. I am not completely giving up on the Sisterhood series, but I hope the rest of them are better."
2,"Eh, it was ok","Paybackby Fern MichaelsReviewer: Pamela Ackerson author Home of the Braves trilogyEh, it was okNothing to rant and rave about. We have a group of female vigilantes, running around revenging wrongs that have been done to people. The last few chapters, basically the climax of the story was worth reading. Not a lot of explanations which left me wondering, often. Like who is Willie? A ghost named Barbara keeps talking about him. No clue as to who he is. Also, I finished reading the book and didn't realize I was done. I went back to finish the novel and poof. I was already done. I didn't even realize I finished the story. I know I saw 40 pages of previews for books already written but I didn't feel as if I finished with the one I was reading. Absolutely, no desire to read the previews.It just didn't do at all. At least not for me."
4,Fun reading.,"I enjoyed reading this book although there were a few inconsistencies like Kathyrn's dog, Murphy. He's a ""Belgian malinois"" in ""Weekend Warriors"" then a shepherd in ""Payback"" & ""Vendetta,"" I haven't read the other books in the series yet so I don't know if Murphy has morphed. Otherwise I really loved the book & will read the others in the series."
4,A good idea,"Mmmm....a little bit graphic, *but* I like it. Easily read. I intend to read the entire Sisterhood series now."
2,Disappointment,"Looking for something to listen to as I drove back and forth to summer school this summer, I found Weekend Warriors, the first book in the Sisterhood Series. I had heard about the series and thought I would give it a try. After finishing Weekend Warriors, I had my library do an interlibrary loan for Payback. It has been such a disappointment. Beside some continuity mistakes (check out the breed of dog in Weekend Warriors vs. Payback) the plot is a real stretch, and you have to suspend belief in that there would be more of a search in the disappearance of a VP nominee. As the book plodded on the ""revenge"" seemed like some plot device drawn out of a hat. I won't be wasting any more time on this series."
4,Good story,"Fern Michaels has done another excellent job with this installment about the Sisterhood. Great suspense, and Laurel Merlington is great,, too."
1,did not receive DVD,"When I ordered this DVD, I kept waiting for it to show up, it never did, I don't know whether it got lost in the mail or whatever. The seller did refund me when I contacted them."
1,MARTINI SHAKER,"I WAS DISSAPOINTED IN THE PRODUCT. THE DESIGN ON THE GLASS WAS SMALL AND DISCOLORED. THE GLASS APPEARED CLOUDY AND DIRTY LOOKING. I RETURNED THE ITEM BAISED ON THE ABOVE INFORMATION, TOP WAS DEFECTIVE."
4,vastly underrated hardcore metal band,"This album's opener, ""Strength To Strength"", is one of the best songs I have ever heard. It gets a little less good, like Slayer's ""Seasons In The Abyss,"" after the first song, but it does not fall apart like Slayer's album did.Good album, though."
4,soulquake system really does it for me!,"Hey! I'm from the same town as this band. If you like big, fat, pure hardcore music this is the band for you. Some songs really rock the butt of you, but as a whole the cd tend to be a little bit boring. But as I said, if you are a hardcore hardcore lover, you're gonna love this little cd. By the way, krhmn HC rocks!"
3,Not a bad tie,"I bought this because I was curious about the cuflinks. I dress in a suit each day for work, but I also travel and my ties tend to take a beating. Therefore, I look for decent ties, but for the most part I try to buy on sale or less expensive. It isn't a bad tie. The quality is ok. It is silk, but not very soft and the overall quality of the garment is mediocre. The cuflinks are awful. The bottom line is that this is a decent product line for a $12 tie, but don't count on top-notch quality."
5,Essential reading,This book is essential for Jewish and Christian Zionists alike. It certainly helped me understand the issues between Christians and Jews who profess a love for Israel. Zev Chafets did a great service by writing this book.
4,Exquisite flavors,"Rodriguez is an excellent chef and a great cookbook writer. I bought this after eating a couple of meals in one of his newer restaurants in NYC, Chicama, where the creative ceviches, oyster appetizers and other dishes are absolutely out of this world. Combining unlikely flavors to create new versions of Latin American standards, this book contains many recipes you will want to make over and over. Only challenges: some ingredients are hard to find, and most of the recipes take a little extra preparation. Small price to pay for uncommonly good food."
5,"Schenker ""Mr. Guitar""","This is the best sounding MSG album, and probably the most aggressive. With former Rainbow vocalist Graham Bonnet making his debut with Schenker. The vocals are great and sound so much different than Gary Barden ('80-'81,'83-'84). Drummer Ted Mckenna is on top form, and of course Schenker is awesome. Never one to show-off; his solos are perfect pieces within the song. But when he lets it go look out! ""Rock you to the Ground"", ""Desert Song"" and the instrumental ""Ulcer"" are incredible songs that epitomize Schenkers' genious. One of the best hard-rock albums ever."
5,one of the best old msg record,"this record just rocks you to the ground,itsgot some of the greatest songs that you could everhear by msg,even though I loved gary bardenas a singer front man,graham bonnet does a greatjob too,and schenker never fails to kick some button guitar,this is what I love to hear from msg.I hopeto hear something like this on the 25 years of msg comingsoon with the original singers.I guess two reviewsshow a lot of good respect for asault attack since I don't see adelete button right now."
3,Tommy I&II,"This former staple of Caltech existence was recently shot down by the fact that the author no longer teaches the class. Still, one look inside either imposing tome and the reader is immediately struck by the incredible, insurmountable, dullness of the thing. There are rumors of people capable of reading both in their entirety, but your humble critic remains wary of such claims.Of the two, Tommy I is generally considered to be superior, mainly because it features 666 pages, something that says as much about the content as the length. Tommy II boasts of a less remarkable 672 pages. Both make admirable doorstops."
2,not much to it,"I rented it before making a decision on purchasing, and that was a good move. The film looked interesting, but upon viewing it that was the extent of it. Its look was the best thing about it. The script was weak, and while I'm sure the actors did the best they could with what they were given they really didn't do that well. Of course, that fault could well lie with the director, as sometimes they can be so intent on visual atmosphere that they suppress the emotional atmosphere. It wouldn't be the first time that's been the case in a movie. The end result, whatever the case, is a pretty boring film with fairly unsympathetic characters weaving their way through gloomy events, and in the end I really didn't care at all what happened to any of them. It was just shot well, which I'm sure isn't the only positive impression the filmmakers want to leave anyone with. ""Cthulhu"" is a technically competent film but a very, very flat one."
2,Despite being a decent horror flick by the end it was horrible,"Chthulhu.... What should have been a homage for a fabulous writer was instead turned into a platform for various leftist ideas such as the collapse of the US, Global Warming and Homosexual themes. The first half of this movie is pointless to the story and more about a gay man being discriminated than about cosmic horror.By the end of the movie it manages to create a sense of tension and fear. I can't give it a 1 but its damn close. I must say my hopes for this movie were horribly dashed."
1,Waste of time....,"I rented this from Net Flix, skeptical because of the reviews I have read. Frankly it was a waste of my time and and brain power. I spent the entire moving movie trying to piece the events together and how they related to the plot. I came up with nothing. None of the events were really even relative to the ending. To some it up quickly, guy's mom dies...guy gets involved in this sinister plot of the cult his father runs...weird stuff happens...irrelevant weird stuff...bad twist ending that is in no way relevant to the way the character has acted the entire movie. The most ridiculous part is the previews were all gay dramas, but the fact that the character is gay has nothing to do with anything, nothing at all. Its mind boggling how any of this movie works. It fails as a horror suspense, it fails as a Mythos movie, and it fails as a gay drama."
1,Dreadful TOTALLY Dreadful!!!,"Not only does this have nothing to do The Call of Cthulhu nor any Lovecraft story but it was made by a company that makes Gay films and they turned it in to a Gay story with mild Gay love scenes and masturbation. Lovecraft never wrote a Gay story. It is not relevant to Lovecraft.If your are a Lovecraft fan, stay away from this film at all costs. I should ask to return it but I want the satisfaction of throwing this trash in the trash can.Note, I do not dislike the movie because it has a gay theme. I dislike it because it has nothing to do with Lovecraft or any story of his. The description of this film should be changed to A movie with a terrible script, terrible acting, terrible directing and, by the way, it has nothing to do with Lovecraft."
1,Very Disappointing...,"I was excited to rent this movie on Netflix, and I was horribly disappointed with what I received. This movie is yet another lack luster hodge-podge of Lovecraft stories which attempts to cover many ideas in his works and in doing so completely fails to deliver on any of them. It fails to build suspense or terror, while the actors flatly deliver their lines. Like other one-star reviewers of this film, I wish I could give it zero-stars.It never ceases to amaze me how H.P. Lovecraft can inspire so many writers and yet no one seems to be able to adapt any of his stories to the screen without ruining his work. Lovecraft was a great writer, would somebody please - when adapting his work - trust Lovecraft enough to create an actual Lovecraft movie and not some Frankenstein's monster of his story ideas?"
1,sadly another butchering of hp's mythos,"First I like tori spelling, she realizes she is a great actress for b style movies,that being said I like b movies. Why I do not like this movie simple.I am a Bigger fan of the Cthulhu mythos and when you attempt to make a movie with the Cthulhu name you better deliver, they did not.here's an idea keep your romantic angst views for a romantic angst type movie, you want to make a horror movie make a horror movie.Next if you want to make an innsmouth movie....my advice try harder or change genres."
1,Where is Cthulhu?,"Have you read ""The Shadow over Insmouth""? Reed it before you think in see this movie. It seems that the people tha made the movie forgoth that they were filming a movie about Cthulhu. You can't understand that movie if you haven't read ""The Shadow"". It doesn't seem to be thought as a well realized horror film... It was made just like a... kind of expresion for some kind of angry people."
1,Bad,"Its a take off on Shadow over Innsmouth. The original had no love interest, let alone a gay love interest. It sucks...do not buy!"
4,"refreshing, yet...","Being a Devotee of the Great Cthulhu, I expected this film to dwell more on The Great One and his slimy apparations. Yet, dispite the title, it delves into other Lobvecraft work and underlines Lovecrat's art of bringing the unsettling ino our conciousnesses.Many here have remarked about this film's ""gayness."" It is refreshing to see a film involving gays that does not adhere to the usual stereotype, but chooses to show us as real people in the world.Be forewarned: It has a ""cliffhanger"" ending. Does the protaganist in the end kill his lover or his cult father as a sacrafice to the Great Cthulhu? It's up to you to decide!"
4,"An elegant ,intelligent ,well-written overview - well judged","This is an intelligent, elegantly written book which draws fluently on the political, cultural, economic and military tales of the time. My wife and I read this to ourselves before going to bed and there is nothing dry, scholarly or pedantic about it. It is what general history should be like. I might be tempted to give it ***** but I think that should be reserved for something quite exceptional. Nonetheless this is a balanced,informed and well-written book about a key figure in the history of western civilization. Clearly the man was a strutting vainglorious fop but still today when his military achievements seem thin and his judgement in political and religious matters extremely questionable the reign of Louis XIV can still be seen be one where a civilization was in full flower."
2,Not worth the money,"The base and bars are constructed from soft metal, so when cutting moderately hard tile (eg, porcelain) I found I was more likely to shatter the tile than cut it. You get what you pay for, and in this case you get a lot of damaged tiles.This might be ok for small ceramic tiles, but personally I'd shy away."
2,wasnt that great,this wasnt what i thought it would be for my hair.. it hasnt helped my scalp much! i thought that it would help my skin but it didnt
3,RCA Cables,"Hard to find in the retail stores works fine, but next time I'll buy a $1.00 connector and buy a regular cable not the Extension cable"
5,A good guitar cleaning product.,"I have a number of guitars from different brands. Recently I've been using this kit from Lyon to clean and polish all of my instruments. This is a good kit, and it comes at a decent price. You get a spray bottle of guitar polish and a spray bottle of string cleaner. If you don't clean your strings regularly you should try it-your strings will last much longer on average. It also comes with a small cleaning cloth. I prefer larger cloths for cleaning my gear, so I'm using the provided cloth to clean the strings.No complaints after a few uses. My guitars look beautiful and the clean strings play very well."
3,"Good, but...","I really like the polish, it works well and makes my guitar look really nice. The cloth leaves a bit to be desired, however (leaves some residue) so I would use something else.This would get 4 or even 5 stars, but I received two bottles of polish and no string cleaner. I unfortunately didn't notice this until a few months after I purchased it because I mainly use the polish, so it was too late to do anything. I wish I'd gotten the string cleaner (seriously needing it now!), but it was my fault for overlooking it. So I do recommend you check the box to make sure you have the right product right so you can request an exchange or something."
2,Ken Harris review,"I was really hoping to like this game. You get the impression of playing an unfinished product. Problem #1 : At point blank range with a broadside from any ship, your likelyhood of hitting something is never greater than 10 % a shot. This is understandable at twenty miles but at 100 yard? Problem #2 no lands masses, island, depth? They recreat the battle of Savo Island with no island and no chance of finding a transport fleet at anchor.no subs, no planes, no carriers, no signifigant objectives?On the plus side accurate depiction of vessels, and nice 3d look"
5,What game did you guys play?,"What game did you guys play?? This is a fascinating game. I got it when it first came out, been playing it until this past spring when it finally gave out. Probably played several hundred games and that doesn't cout my son who has played it for several years as well. I'm ordering another Fighting Steel, since I have seen nothing better in shp to ship combat. By the way - have you tried Carriers At War?? AWESOME. Each gen just gets better."
4,An excellent reference on American political history,"An incredibly well-researched reference, layed out beautifully, enhanced with photos of funny and fascinating political memorabilia; informative, as well as entertaining and lively. A great addition to any school or general library, or to the collection of any avid student or fan of American political and popular culture."
2,"""Looney Tunes Collector's Edition: Tex-Book Looney""","I've watched ""The Heckling Hare"", ""Daffy Duck in Hollywood"", ""Hollywood Steps Out"" and ""Tortoise Beats Hare""."
3,Not bad and certainly not Gemmell's best,"There are some series that leave you tired at the end from all the mental twists and turns that you have to do to follow the plot. The Jon Shannow series, which begins with this book, is like that. The way the series ends is enough to keep you awake for awhile. Gemmell was juuuust author enough at this point in his career to pull this series off. Had he waited a few more years for his skills to develop, this might have been an incredible series. As it is, it is good, and the plot twists really imaginative, but the writing is just up to the level needed. Gemmell's Rigante series is, IMHO, the best he wrote with the Drenai series a close, close second. In Shannow you can see the traits he would try to develop in Waylander and Skilgannon. Shannow is sort of a prototype for them, I think. Anyway, the series is good on its own and essential for Gemmell-ophiles, but if you have read other Gemmell books, don't expect the quality to be quite up to par."
4,Super Reader,"The setting for this series is a post apocalyptic type old West, based on the premise that very bad things happened when the planet shifted its axis, causing devastation.A satanic cult of Hellborn is out to rule, using bloodstone sacrifices and other nasty power tricks.They shouldn't have sacrified Jon Shannow's woman, though, because now they have the deadliest of enemies : The Jerusalem Man."
2,I Expext More,"This book covers about 50 - 60 percent of what is on the IBM DB2 UDB 7.1 family fundamentals test and about 40 percent of what is needed for the IBM DB2 UDB 7.1 513 DBA certification. I have taken and passed both exams. Frankly I think any book or series of book that claims to be associated with the IBM Certification Guide series should cover the topic in depth. The test is sooo much more in depth, so that from this book you have not much chance of passing the tests. This book is NOT even a good reference guide, as you need much more information than is given to do anything but basic bare essential [stuff].If You want a good book that covers the topics in depth get ""All In One DB2 Administration Exam Guide"" for learning the material (The cd test engine [is not good]). For another book that is short of material but has a GREAT cd test engine (great for practice testing) get the ""DB2 Fundamentals Certification for Dummies"" just for the CD."
4,A must have for Exams 512 and 513,"Using mainly this book, I have passed both exams (512 and 513) on the first try. I have several years of experience as a DBA in both Oracle and Sql Server.IMHO, this book is a must-have for passing 512 and 513. Test 513 is indeed fairly challenging. My preparation consisted of learning the first 12 Chapters of this book backwards and forwards, installing DB2 from the enclosed CD, tinkering a bit, and becoming familiar with the online documentation.It is true that the book only covers 70% of the stuff on Test 513. Print out the objectives for test 513 from IBM's site and carefully review it. Use the online documentation for areas that you are not familiar with."
4,Right Film at the Right Time,"This is the right film at the right time. It lays facts about Iran and its history in front of you, explains further in the US context and makes the case against war. Great research and straightforward message!"
1,Product great ...packaging terrible!,"Was glad to find the product and although I had to buy a ton of them...no problem. The problem was that whoever did the packaging just threw them in a box and no paper or cushion or styrofoam bits. One came broken and oozed all over the box, and another two were dented but no cracks. Would not recommend this dealer for that reason but the product is still good. Well, the ones that survived the journey."
2,The Shakespeare Stealer,I did this for my 7th grade humanities class.This story is about an orphan named Widge. He goes to a man named Dr. Bright who adopts him. Then he goes to a different man named Falconer who is very rude to Widge. Then Falconer tells him to steal Shakespeare play. He tries but all the actors want him to stay so he is stuck between Falconer and his new friends.I rated the Shakespeare Stealer two stars because I don't really like Medieval Times Books. But people who do like would really enjoy The Shakespeare Stealer.I would recommend this book to people who like the Medieval Times. It is a really good book and I recommend it to everyone.
2,"""The Shakespeare Stealer""","The Shakespeare Stealer is a pretty good book. It's a book for those who enjoy plays, adventure, and books that take place in the 1800's. It's also a book for those who enjoy historical and realistic fiction. I think it's neat how it didn't even happen but it fits into time like it really did. I believe it's an interesting book, but it's also in some ways true. Even though it is called the Shakespeare Stealer it's also about some of Shakespeare's greatest plays. At different points of the book they're either at a play, practicing for a play, or on a trip to an other place where they will enjoy another one of Shakespeare's great plays. I would probably recommend this book to boys because I'm not sure if girls would enjoy the fast paced action of this book. I would also recommend this book to people who enjoy realistic adventure and old time books. I thought this was a good book and I'm sure you will agree."
1,fails to separate fact from fiction,"Book fails to separate fact from fiction, this will boggle readers and make them look like fools when they speak of such that did not happen during the Elizabethian Era. Pass this."
5,Rousing Good Read,This book begs to be read aloud. Colorful characters and a interesting tidbits of information about Elizabethan and Shakespearean life. It's full of unexpected twists and turns. I can't wait to read the sequel!
3,good fun for Shakespeare buffs,"Blackwood has done his theater-history homework, and his rendition of backstage life is vivid and believable. His historical figures (Richard Burbage, Will Kemp, Shakespeare himself) are pretty one-dimensional and his fictional boy actors speak to one another in overly contemporary tones at times, but the story moves quickly and Blackwood does avoid the sentimentality that mars the similarly-themed King of Shadows by Susan Cooper. Widge is resourceful and shows off a wry sense of humor without being too self-absorbed. The novel's surprises are not so surprising to anyone who's watched Shakespeare in Love, but the realistic details of sword-fighting, stage effects and line memorization make this a great read for anyone interested in theater."
4,The Review of a Medieval Action Novel,"I read The Shakespeare Stealer book for a 7th grade reading assignment. I am writing this review as a final writing assignment.The Shakespeare Stealer has a ton of action. It is about a boy about 15 named Widge. He is bought by a man named Simon Bass. Widge's assignment is to steal the Shakespeare play Hamlet. Join him on his adventures while he makes new friends and joins in on duels that can risk his life, all for a play!!My rating for this book is a 4 stars because the book has a lot of action and there is always something going on. I didn't rate it a 5 because it doesn't explain a lot of things. Like, what people look like, or what kind the weapons their using look like.I would recommend this book to a person that likes reading historical fiction about Medieval Times. Also, a person who likes a lot of action and duels would like this book. I would not recommend this book to a person that can't understand old English. It has a lot in it."
3,Shakespeare Stealer,"Action, suspense, and Shakespeare! The Shakespeare Stealer is a historical fiction novel that accurately reflects the Elizabethan time period. This is a great novel for kids to read in conjunction with William Shakespeare's plays. It provides a window into this time period that explains a lot of the background information behind the theater of Shakespeare's time. A young orphan, Widge, finds himself in London when his master gives him one mission - to steal a copy of Shakespeare's Hamlet from Bard himself! He just has one problem. He discovers that he likes the theater company and becomes friends with the actors. Through the suspenseful course of the novel Widge discovers the true meaning of loyalty and family."
4,Lovely Story!,Really enjoyed this book. Used in our study of The Middle Ages. A delightful story for young and old alike.
5,The Shakespeare Stealer,"I'm Bari Ann and an intermediate reader. I thought 'The Shakespeare Stealer' was truly fabulous! It's about an orphan named Widge, living in England in Shakespeare's time. He unwillingly is swept up into adventure and choices. No one is who they seem to be, and the plot is deep and twisting. I couldn't put this book down! It's a wonderful read."
1,pages missing,"I ordered this book for my daughter to read for school. She was having trouble answering the questions for Chapter 4 so I read it to help her and found that pages 27 through 58 were missing. It didn't look as if the pages had been torn out, but rather that they had never been there to begin with. Obviously, we had to get another copy of the book. I'm not going to return this one as I'd have to pay for shipping and would only get a partial credit. Thought I'd warn others so they can check the book as soon as they get it and can get a full refund."
1,"To Portray History is Important, but Careful Thought is in Order","I thought this was a well-written book, but the gratuitous anti-semitism was a surprising kick in the gut. Although this sentiment unfortunately is somewhat accurate within the historical framework in the novel, its use in the novel was completely unnecessary to the unfolding of the story. There was nothing of relevance in the story that made its inclusion sensible. The anti-semitism of the characters came across as intentional and hateful rather than part of the historical fiction. It was apropos of nothing in the story. It just hung there and left you wondering ""From whence came this?"" ""Is this what we teach children?"" It was very disappointing. I would advise against reading this book unless you're prepared to explain anti-semitism to your children, historically and in today's world."
3,The Shakespear Stealer,I think the book was O.K. I would recomend it to anyone beetween the ages of 9-13
5,YEAH! read this!,"In the new book The Shakespear Stealer Gary Blackwood carry's your mind away. Widge,14 the main character is sold as an apprentice from Dr. Bright to Mr. Bass. Widge is sent off by Mr. Bass, to copy Hamlet one of Shakespears biggest plays in his uncommon way of writing. Dr. Bright taught it to him so he could write down everything he did. Widge meets some pretty tough obsticles. Will he get the play copied? To find out read this exellent suspensing book called The Shakespear Stealer."
4,A fun novel!,"The Shakespeare Stealer is a fast paced novel for kids and teens. There is some historical information about Elizabethan England that I enjoyed. The title includes Shakespeare, but not much is said of the playwright in the novel. This novel starts when a boy named Widge is adppted by a doctor but then Widge is sold to another master. (I can't tell you who it is). The author of this book seems to have a lot of information about plays in the Shakespeare time. The reader will pick up much of it. The only reason I gave this book 4 stars instead of 5 is that a little twist in it is quite predicatable. The major ending isn't. If you want something that will take you 2 nights to read, try The Shakespeare Stealer. It is also good for kids wanting information about Shakespeare."
5,The Shakespere Stealer!!!,The Shakspere Stealer is about a boy named Widge who is sent to copy the play Hamlet from Shakespere himself. He was to write it down in his secret language. He ended up meeting the cast and Shakespere.Widge makes the cast members friends with him.Will he disobey his master or be a true blue friend. This book led me to great adventure.
1,Unless you're an expert . . .,"this program will confuse and confound you. I'm pretty good at picking up software through trial and error and use of the Help screens. Though I will admit this is my first attempt at creating a Web page, I have (after approximately 30 hours of work), given up on this product. I purchased it because of the reasonable price and the rave reviews on the box - It says you can have your site up and running within 24 hours (I assumed this meant one day), no such luck for me. The Help files are incomplete (choose one of SEVERAL topics and land on the product description screen - in other words, there is no help on MANY of the listed topics), and the Help function doesn't even LIST a lot of the program functions. The box says a beginner can use this product, but I have to disagree. I could not possibly recommend this program to anyone."
3,Not for Newbies,"I used an earlier version of Quicksite with fairly good luck. I actually had a web site up and running with 3 pages in 1 hour. O.k., so maybe with 20 years in I.T. (Information Technology) left me understanding way more than the average internet user! But I still had no direct knowledge of building a web site. Still, it was cheaper to get QS than paying for a course or professional help. My web site has been up for over 2 years now and I'm going to be adding on a shopping catalog shortly, using QS as the guide. I've saved thousands of dollars creating the web site and maintaining it myself. It's not as fancy as other web sites but then I don't need all that to get across to people. Like with anything technical, you have to work at understanding it, then you have to be like a child and explore and play. I set up two other web sites since then and am pleased with the results. Simple is good."
1,Didn't Consult iPOD Users in Design Process,"I purchased this monitor to replace a Bose iPOD dock and was sorely disappointed. Great picture quality, but iPOD doc does not work. When you can get it to work the volume control is through an OSD in the monitor setup. The thumbwheel on the front only controls the base. I'm sending mine back.When I booted up with the monitor on and iPOD docked, Windows wanted to write over the iPOD thinking it was an improperly formatted drive.Shame on ViewSonic. I called ViewSonic and told them my problems and they said, ""You can play iTunes."" I told them my iTunes songs were on my hard drive, why do I need a docking station to play them, they didn't get it.Do NOT buy this monitor."
2,Anti Climatic,"Was expecting a unique unit which would allow me to uniquely integrate my IPod and PC. What I got instead was a nice looking monitor with ok graphics, tinney sounding speakers and menu buttons which discourage you from making any adjustments to the settings due to their feel and non ease-of-use. The number of USB ports and card readers on the base are the shining points of this monitor. I paid the bucks but didn't get any bang!!!"
1,tsk tsk bad Viewsonic bad....,"I got this thing today from CompUSA and came here for the reviews because my ViewSonic died on me after 10 minutes. I've always liked Viewsonic for its beautiful monitors and I was loving this monitor for the entire 10 minutes. Unfortunately I didn't get a chance to try the dock. Speakers are nicer then most monitors but nowhere close to external speakers.I search for some reviews on large monitors and found out that a 20"" has the same max resolution as a 22"". So good discovery after a bad experience. I'll be taking the Viewsonic back and looking into a 23"". The 1 star is for the beautiful piano black housing."
2,"iPod Dock Does not Work, Looks Great","Pros: The monitor looks great and has many great features -- card readers, integrated speakers, USB ports and iPod dock.Cons: I have a new iPod nano with a video screen and it is not recognized when I put it into the dock. I appears to be charging, but the computer is unable to recognized that I have the iPod plugged in. But when I use the official Apple USB cable (plugged into the monior's USB port) it does recognize it. So either my particular monitor is broken (so sad because I threw the box away) or it just won't work with my newer iPod."
3,Screen is great; sound sucks,"The display itself is very good, but the speakers are substandard in all respects. I am not happy with the poor attempt to put a subwoofer in the base of the monitor, and the integrated tweeters in the monitor bezel are pretty lame as well. The iPod dock works OK, but I have an older iPod that is Firewire-based, while the ViewSonic dock is USB, so I have to remember to remove it from the dock when the computer is asleep or it will drain the battery. Save your money and get the regular version of this monitor and use the difference to buy a decent set of speakers."
3,What we read for love,"A good weekend read,even with every reference being before my time.A good book for anyone wanting to read about a person's experiences with love"
1,Hated It!,I thought this book was one long boring tale. My only saving grace is that I bought it at a store that was going out of business. I only wasted $2.00. Don't waste your time or money on this boring book.
5,My favorite in the Da Bomb line,"Ground Zero is my favorite sauce in the Da Bomb line. It's a step up from Beyond Insanity heat-wise. It measures at 234,000 scoville units (compared to 120,000 in Beyond Insanity).This is where Da Bomb starts to seperate the chili-heads from the rest. Like all of the Da Bomb sauces this one has a VERY nice pipe-tobacco-like smell. Ground Zero has a nice fruity pineapple smell to it as well. Taste is similar. Like Beyond Insanity this one is very thick so its easy to accidently drop a bit more then intended on your food. Da Bomb sauces provide a unique burn because the burn takes a LOOONG time to really peak so it's easy to accidently eat too much... be careful!If you have experience with extreme hot sauces then by all means pick this up. If you are new to extreme hot sauce then I would probably start with Beyond Insanity... it's still quite hot."
5,ABC Dog,"This is a brilliantly fun book, for kids and the grown-ups who read to them. Do yourself a favor and buy it."
3,Dress up Fairytopia,"This dress was a bit disappointing comparing to other Barbie and Disney dresses. It is too small for anyone over 3 yrs old. I took the items off the bodice and attached to a body suit/leotard to fit my 6 yr old granddaughter. The wings were the best part. They were the perfect size, attached easily and stayed on through a 2 hr skating party. I gave it a 5 for fun because my granddaughter loved it after I remade it. She wears it around the house and will wear for Halloween."
4,Incredibly motivating,"This book suggests the crazy notion that ANYONE can write! What more do you need to lift your spirits - and your pen? Natalie's quick, moving suggestions in every chapter got me not only inspired to create, but made me develop a stronger passion for literature and writing in general. I originally looked at this book for advice/information on the creative process, not just writing. What a wonderful creative boost this was.However, the ideas full of fire and motivation seem to die out somewhere in the first half of the book. (It's not just me - I tried to pick it up a few weeks later, beginning halfway.) The second half of the book seems to just be 'filler'..Still I recommend it if you feel like the pen is calling you.."
5,Very inspiring and well worth re-reading regularly,"The author encourages us to notice the details in life and to celebrate everything which pleases us or makes an impression on us, as that is what makes writing lively and personal. Her book has also inspired me to carry on writing in my notebook even when I don't believe I'm a very good writer, as all writing practice is ""composting"" which could eventually result in some great ideas coming through. I am always dipping into this book and attempting to follow the author's suggestions. I have given copies to two other people who are keen amateur writers, and I usually take mine with me when I go away. All in all, I think this book offers hope to those who like writing but don't believe they're great writers or aren't even sure what they want to say. As the author says, if you care about what you're doing, it probably will be good. I have had a lot of fun as a result of reading this."
5,I'd give it more stars if it could give me the TIME I need to write . . .,"This is a writing motivator to which I keep returning - and until I finally commit my life and TIME to writing, I will keep listening to Natalie urge me to put my life to the written word. This is THE collection that you need to overcome writer's ""cramp"" (MY word), or the dreaded BLOCK. Love the words about he geraniums - I had one when I was a freshman in a bleak, shared domitory room, and it brought back reminiscences that I can add to my list of writing topics.Don't miss this special collection, especially now that it's on CD's.Now if only someone would render a product that avails the TIME to write... now that would be worthy of purchase."
3,Will Always Be Room on My Bookshelf for Bones,"Although Natalie is a professional writer and makes her living writing books, at her core she is a writer who understands the sheer bliss that comes from putting words on paper. Her books are ones that I periodically put away only to find months later when I'm really in need of a reminder that there is more to the writing life than paying the bills.It always amazes me how when I pick up her books and flip through them I find the exact perfect thing that I needed at the time. When I flipped through Writing Down the Bones tonight, I found her advice on getting outside of yourself with different props to alter your perspective on the world. That was very valuable advice as I often get into a writing rut and keep dipping my pen into the same well of ideas.There will always be room my bookshelf for ""Writing Down the Bones."""
5,What a Wonderful Book for Writers!,"I can't believe all the bad reviews I've read here. This is a beautiful book. If you love writing, I mean really love it: If writing is a part of who you are, if you constantly see stories/poems in every part of your daily life (no matter how mundane), this book is for you. I appreciate Goldberg's passion for writing and it is evident on every page. Okay, she gets into some spiritual/philosophical issues I don't agree with, but I can still enjoy the book for what it is: A celebration of the passion and joy of writing. I can't imagine anyone who loves writing not having a great time with this wonderful book."
2,Meh...,"This is one of those books that's highly acclaimed, utilized in writing courses across the country, considered a classic, etc. etc....and just fell flat for me.Sure, it has a few interesting articles, but all in all, it's nothing you couldn't figure out for yourself. I didn't find any inspiration or gain any new insights on writing (and mind you, I LIKE writing books that are more new agey/hippy dippy than those on hard technique. But this just didn't connect with me. Like I said, a lot of what she talks about you can figure out on your own. And without too much difficulty).Writing books that have helped me, and have a permenant place on my bookshelf, are:If you Want to Write by Brenda UelandEscaping into the Open: The Art of Writing True by Elizabeth BergThe Writer's Survival Guide by Rachel SimonThe Right to Write by Julia CameronThe Hidden Writer: Diaries and the Creative Life by Alexandra JohnsonGuide to Fiction Writing by Phyllis Whitney"
5,Just starting,"and I love this book so far. I am doing the ""requirements"" as I go along. So far, so good."
2,"Um, not writing.","This book starts off very slow. I was hoping for more writing advice, but all I got was super-wordy. Bare Bones takes awhile to get to the point. Mainly the writer has a bunch of stories rather than advice."
3,Some interesting points,"This book is broken into easily digestible sections, so you can just pick it up, read a few pages and set it back down again. A few of the tips and philosophies are thought provoking, but I found the spiritual undercurrents to be distracting. Well-written, but ultimately hit-or-miss, unless you have Buddhist sympathies or can attend a yoga class without rolling your eyes."
2,Good book,"Writing Down Bones is a good book for a start-up writer. It shares the passion, the heart, and the depth of being a truly heart-felt writer.However, the book does seem to concentrate on the romanticism of writing rather than any reality that is connected to being a writer. A real writer wants to be read not only just write. A real writer wants to be able to earn a living somehow from their writing not just to write only for the pleasure.It is true that a real writer has an urgency to write more than anything else; but a real writer also wants to advance and succeed in their writing.As I said, this is a good book for the beginner to learn how to delve deep into the psyche and pull out the heart.Be aware, viewers, that this is a book originally printed in the 80s and written by a product of the 60s so there are some very anti-traditional viewpoints."
3,Not as good as I thought it would be,I don't know why I came out of the book disappointed. Maybe because it has been raved to me. Maybe it is that we have used the exercises in our writers' group (I do have fondness for those.) Maybe it is due to the fact that it was written so long ago that a lot of it felt dated. I got the message: Write. It helped me look forward to NaNoWriMo. But the quotes of her guru so often felt weak. It would have rang truer if these thoughts were her own.I read this on Kindle but I do have the paperback so I do plan to work through a few more exercises during November.
4,Free Flowing from the Heart,"Natilie Goldberg inpires and motivates writers to be true to themselves and write from the heart. Ms. Goldberg's experience with her desire to connect with herself spills off the pages. She allows herself to be self-absorbed in her work, and offers the reader wisdom from her past experiences. Her titles are humorous, and they help to build metaphors pertaining to writing. Goldberg's writing is easy and free flowing."
5,The Best Writing Book I have ever seen!,As a high school English teacher I hope to be a expert on the subject of writing. This is the single best and most influencial text I have ever read.
2,Ugh. Too hokey.,"I've read a fair amount of books on writing. I know this one is considered a ""classic"" in the genre, but I didn't care for it. It has some good practical advice. Nothing I haven't heard or read elsewhere, but good reminders nonetheless. But what I'll probably remember about this book is the flakiness of Goldberg, who insists on referring to her Zen training in every chapter. Enough about Katagiri Roshi and your meditations already. I'm sure they're wonderful for you. And the chapter that starts, ""There were several time in Taos that I called a story-telling circle,"" makes me want to rip the page out and eat it. Try BIRD BY BIRD or even STEPHEN KING'S ON WRITING before this one."
5,An awesome book for right brain writers,"I absolutely love this book! It is such an encouragement to me as a writer. Goldberg has a way of dispelling the haze that often accompanies perfectionism, writer's block, or feeling like you have to be a ""goody two shoes"", as she says. (Goody two shoes writer are ones that faithfully write *every* day, but their writing lacks life and energy. They are writing because they're ""supposed"" to.)Granted, this isn't a book for logical, left-brain, or technical writers. They won't ""get"" it. But for poets, or any other writer that wants to treat themselves gently, or have a cup of proverbial tea with an encouraging comrade, this book is a must. It's very Zen-like, and I love the down-to-earthiness of the author. It's obvious she lives in joy, and sees so much past the obvious."
4,The On-Ramp,"I bought Writing Down the Bones after hearing how wonderful it was a few years ago. I felt it lived up to the recommendations; however, I see it as the on-ramp rather than the actual highway of a writing career. The subtitle is ""Freeing the Writer Within,"" and Ms. Goldberg's book does that. It's the beginning rather than the end. I'd like to say I've become a published novelist since reading this book, but that hasn't happened yet. It did get me out of the writer's ""closet"" so now I write in public places whenever I feel so inclined.For those who haven't taken the first baby steps toward being a writer, here's the way to get on your feet. Writing Down the Bones will help you ""walk that walk and talk that talk."""
1,Embarrasing Proselytizing of Eastern Religion,"The book has little to do with writing and more to do with Eastern religion. If you don't want to hear about the mindless philosophies that have transcended into America in recent years, then don't buy this book; the author bondards you with it. I felt it was not only a waste of my money, but also deceiving. I wanted a book about writing, instead I had to hear about this persons religion, and pay for it! Total disappointment and a feeling that I was ripped off!"
2,"Well-intentioned, but more therapy than writing","I heard an interview with Ms. Goldberg on To the Best of Our Knowledge about a year ago in which she told ofher utter shock that her guru Ravi (whatshisname) was sleeping with students. I couldn't believe the naivette of this woman. Years earlier, when I read her book and she was quoting the guy, I had the same response as Tom Bissell in his Believer article, ""Uh-oh.""If you're looking perhaps for a way into creativity or to rearrange your ideas of the word, this insight-lite book might give you some pointers. The more skeptical aspiring writer, however, will find it a little too airie fairie for their tastes."
1,Boring & Lacking Substance,This book is lacking substance. She talks about Zen & it's teachings. I'm not interested in reading about Zen. I don't share her opinion in writing practice. I believe quality is more important than quantity.
3,Tiny reissue,"I ordered the new edition to replace my long-lost original paperback version. I remember the chapters as being a good jumping-off point to get me writing, and I recommend the book to my writing students. This new version is TINY, though--barely bigger than a deck of cards and nearly impossible to read. It never occurred to me to check the dimensions of the book before ordered. If I had, I would have gotten a used copy of the full-size paperback.Contents: 4 starsFormat: 1 star"
4,If you teach this book is excellent,"I have done MANY of these excercises with students in my creative writing classes and they get a LOT out of them. Sure, not everything in this book will work with everyone in every writing situation. But there are some really very good ideas in this book. It does help if you can think creatively because then you see where the author is coming from. But if you're trying to write your first novel at 55 and are stuck after 12 pages, this is NOT the book for you. Keep browsing."
2,Smaller Than Expected,"This book has some interesting writing tips, but its so small and unsubstantial! Not what I expected, but great if you're looking for a fun, pocket-sized writing book."
3,Book Was Okay But Don't Fork Out For A Class With Her!,"This book really inspired me to try my hand at writing and I was very impressed with the candidness and accessibility of the author's style. I'm sure like many others, it made me want to take a class with her in New Mexico. I spent a small fortune to do so, over a thousand dollars for a week long seminar. Save your money and stay home and just write. She is NOTHING like her books in person. She was a narscissitic, self-absorbed whiner, who spent exactly two hours a day in front of the class reading to us from her own notebooks. The rest of the time she told us to do writing practice. When she wasn't swaning around the classroom like a diva, she was slobbering over one of the young students in class, obviously in the midst of some torrid affair. It was embarassing for all of us. I left feeling completely ripped off, so much so that I almost stopped writing! The book should come with a warning label: Do as I say, not as I do."
2,Psychobabble Mamma!,"This book is good for a very specific and narrow purpose:IF you are a newly-hatched, fuzzy writerling, and IF you are seriously low on self-esteem and confidence, and (most importantly) IF you are a fan of unfocused, vaguely New-Agey spirituality and guru-isms as a substitute for actual information, then this book will be greatly helpful to you.Otherwise, give it a miss and spend your self-esteem money on a nice new pen and some chocolates."
3,Disappointed for such a well-recommended book.,"I received this book as a gift after having it on a wish list for quite some time. I'd had it on that wish list because so many of my writer friends recommended it. The reviews here seemed to back up that recommendation. While I am sure this book has been helpful to a lot of people, it has been less so for me. My hope was that this book would explore various processes of writing, and maybe help me hone my skills. But this book seemed much more about how to live your life as a writer in the hopes of sparking bursts of creativity. If you're in need of getting your creativity to feed your writing, this might be just the book for you. I just know that it has not been very helpful for me."
2,Just The Bones,"For the money, this book isn't so hot. Just a collection of essays that tend to be repetitive."
1,Writing down to the bones,The book was delivered 5 days later than scheduled. The text was highlighted throughout. The fold of the book backing was very weak in the back. This book was terrible and my only good feeling was that it came from amazon inexpensively. The book is negative.
1,waste of time,offers meaningless advise (get a fast pen?) simplistic and useless. go to the movies rather than waste time on this meaningless book.
3,A bit of useful advice,"I read this book, expecting something closer, perhaps, to Julia Cameron's ""Artist's Way"". It really wasn't what I expected at all. Later books that Goldberg wrote after this one, such as Wild Life, were much better. One good bit of advice was actually doing your daily pages with a 'fast' pen, such as a fountain pen. I have to admit, that did help me quite a bit, if only just to assist with easing carpal tunnel! Although where she was getting fountain pens for a mere [price] is a mystery to me! The adage to just keep writing is about as useful as it gets in this book."
2,Weak and off-topic,"I have to agree with several other people. The 'rah-rah, you can do it!' attitude might make beginners feel good, but it will probably seem like empty calories once they are facing the task of actually placing good prose onto blank sheets of paper.Also, I could have done with more mechanics and less biography. The Buddhist proselytizing was unexpected and unwelcome.For good nuts and bolts of how to write well, there are other books to try, such as the Writers' Digest series or ""How to Write a Damn Good Novel"" by James Frey."
5,Writing Down the Bones,"The Book came within the stated time. It is in excellent condition. I'm really enjoying reading it and would recommend {ASIN:1590307941 Writing Down the Bones: Freeing the Writer Within (Shambhala Library)} to all beginning, or middling writers.Thank you!"
2,What are her assumptions?,"Natlie Goldberg seems to make two ustated assumptions:1) that what you are writing is very autobiographical2) that you have a hard time writing (Oh, poor author. Let me hold your hand.)If this is true you may find her book useful. If you are writing more imaginatively or if you are interested in making your writing more intense and effective I would not choose her book. If you seek technique, rather than just encouragement, try Marge Piercy's ""So You Want to Write."""
5,Gilberto's first solo album,Gilberto Santa Rosa sang with Willie Rosario's band and that's where he became well known. I love the albums he made with Willie. This is his first solo album and it's a good one.
4,Dominican Adventures,"I had only a brief five day visit to the DR in the Fall of 2006 for a wedding. Even though I was traveling with a local-speaking partner who had been to the DR many times, I still bought the Lonely Planet book and used it to help build an itinerary. I only had a chance to visit the Southeast corner of the country, as well as the city of Santo Domingo. The Lonely Planet guide helped me find clean and affordable accomodations for less than $50USD/night right on the beach where we rented a local fishing boat for two days to go diving and snorkeling in the local reefs. I'm looking forward to going back to explore other parts of the country. Rental cars were inexpensive, but driving in the DR is an experience as it almost seemed like a ""free-for-all"" at times. The main Interstate is well maintained, but a majority of the local roads are not. The Lonely Planet guide ~as always~ was accurate and helpful."
5,Lonely Planet - Always the best bet,"I bought this book for a trip I'm going on next week. While I have not used it 'in country' yet, I have traveled to many other places, using a Lonely Planet guide as my bible. I find them better than the competitor's guides primarily for their organization, and ease of finding the information you need, fast. The 'Sleeping' sections allow you to easily choose the best hotel option that fits you and your trip, and the 'Getting there & away' section not only tells you where transport is located, but the price, and importantly, the duration. Having this book in my hand next week will allow me to make easy, quick decisions, and concentrate on the most important thing - having fun."
1,More info on Haiti,I did not even buy this edition based on the Amazon reviews. I bought the previous edition with Joyce Connolly's fine information that got me through my trip to Port-au-Prince. I hope Lonely Planet is able to correct their error and return Haiti back to good standing.
1,Not a good guide,"The new Lonely Planet book for the DR is not so great. Quite a few things are already out of date - maybe things change really rapidly here, but I also found some of the recommendations were really disappointing, even irresponsible."
4,Fruit Picker,"This is a fairly good fruit picker for the price. We purchased it for sour cherries, apples, and pears. The apples and pears work fine. The grating on the basket is usually too large for sour cherries. For the cherries we used the picker to shake the tree limb so that the cherries could fall onto a sheet at the base of the tree. Sometimes I would use the basket to wrestle off a group of cherries that were growing together."
1,Wrong Item - Expired formula,They sent me the puppy kit when I ordered the Kitten kit - I went back and checked my order and I did order Kitten. Than the sample formula was expired by about 6 months. Only thing I can use in kit is the bottle so this ended up being expensive for just one bottle. Not worth the cost to return. Next time I will buy from petstore and make sure I get correct formula and non expired formula.
5,Great tape,This is wonderful tape. When you change dressings twice a day this is easier on the patient . We were very grateful .
4,A SOUTHERN VIEW,"The historic South is well preserved and eloquently presented in this final volume of a trilogy that began with ""Southern By The Grace Of God."" This volume is a treasure of over 500 photographs, pictures of Southerners, both young and old, at work, at home, and at play.In addition, there are unforgettable scenes of the South, such as Spanish Moss shrouding live oak trees in South Carolina, the faces of young men in the Southern army shortly before the battle at Manassas Junction, and the old City Hall in Birmingham, Alabama, being destroyed by fire.Part One is devoted to people of the area while Part Two is primarily a postcard gallery of once proud buildings. The final section is made up of letters and accounts."
4,Greatest Hits of Jewish Mysticism,"""The Way into Jewish Mystical Tradition"" presents an interesting pairing: The writing of Lawrence Kushner with a sampling of mystical texts from the past nine centuries.This book from Jewish Lights' ""The Way Into ..."" series is organized around 51 short excerpts from the vast array of Jewish mystical writing.This is a collection of the all-time greats: The Baal Shem Tov, Kook, Heschel, The Zohar, Nachman of Bratslav, and Buber, to name a few.While some of the samples are inscrutable, others are so inspiring that I'm sure I'll return to this book again and again.But it is Kushner's introductory commentaries to each classical text that gives this book true added value.He makes an important point about Jewish mysticism:It's not about self-realization. On the contrary, it's about self-annihilation, or bittul ha-yesh. To quote Yehuda Aryeh Lieb Alter of Ger (1847-1905), the goal is ""annihilating one's self and in each deed submitting to the innermost divine life force."""
3,still dumbed down for the masses,"I think this is an improvement on the STATS Pro Football Scoreboard series, but it still is lacking. STATS used to produce the Pro Football Revealed book, which was basically like this, but 5 times better. It contained more information, more intelligent analysis instead of ""here is a trend, isn't it interesting!"" type comment that often serves as trivia rather than enhancing your football knowledge, and this leaves me feeling that this book is just not as good as I know it could be.They have more stats here than you'll know what to do with, so it'll impress stats freaks, but people looking for that annual that'll do for football what Baseball Prospectus and Big Bad Baseball Annual did for baseball are going to be mildly disappointed.Still, a step back in the right direction for STATS. Start the campaign for the return of intelligent football comment and the return of the 'Pro Football Revealed' series!!"
1,Unusable,"This thing is terrible. It's really, really heavy and only comes with two low quality suction cups. I played with it for weeks, getting it to stay up for only a few days at a time before falling. That, of course, was without anything on it.I had to get a refund on it. The thing MIGHT be usable, if it came with about ten suction cups, but it doesn't. It's manufactured abroad and the distributor in NJ is apparently impossible to get on the phone, so no chance of getting and help that way.It looks really, really pretty but I could NOT get it to do its job. Aubuchon, the seller I purchased from on Amazon, however, is wonderful. A class act all the way through.However, if you don't need it suction cupped to a wall it might be good. As a plant stand in a corner or some such thing."
1,INCORRECT TITLE!!!!,THIS IS NOT THE TEXT BOOK. IT IS LISTED INCORRECTLY! IT IS THE STUDY GUIDE! HOW INFURIATING! WASTED TIME - WASTED MONEY.
5,Love Conquers,"Remarkable! A truly enjoyable read! This was the second of Jacque's Regency Romance books that I read. From the very first chapter, I didn't want to put it down. Again, Jacque does an amazing job of creating characters that you both love and loathe. Jacque does an excellent job of giving you a story that draws you in and just won't let you go. The main character is both strong and cunning and won't give up until the very end. The unjust judgment that she receives from her love and from society is justified in a heartwarming ending."
2,Even light reading might require a red thread,"I have lately been a bit too stressed out to read anything requiring brain activity on my part. So I acquired a collection of ""light reading"". It is however irritating to notice how badly written some of these books are.The main character of ""A Lady of Letters"" is doing such improbable things and for the most part with no motive at all (not even an improbable one) that the whole reading experience becomes truly annoying. The only good part is when the whole family together rally against the authorities (fantastic too, but at least logically so)."
1,Couldn't Finish,The story was so disjointed. I thought the writing was poor. I don't even remember the plot or character's names. That's pathetic because I read this last week. Maybe I don't recall anything about this book because I couldn't finish it. I think I read about half and gave up.
4,A FUN FLICK,"This is a fun slasher flick which doesn't take itself to seriously. It has a wicked sense of humor and not only features the skewering of murder victims but it skewers the film industry too. It's not for everybody and those who dislike slashers should stay away, but for the rest of us there's a lot to like about this movie. The cast and writing are both on target and if you ""get"" these types of films you should definitely get Santa Claws."
4,An Interesting Story.,"I thought this film had a great premise and I enjoyed the two lead performances; Raven and Wayne. It focuses a little too long on the nudity, but an interesting commentary piece on the B movie industry."
1,Don't Put This Under My Tree,"This movie was just anemic. The acting was terrible, the killing scenes were laughable, and the plot has been done before (brilliantly compared to this dog). The 'ladies' in the story should keep their clothes on. The only good thing I can say about this DVD is that the previews of other movies they included are better than the main attraction. If Santa brings you this DVD for Christmas, you KNOW you've been bad. Give me the lump of coal, instead!!!"
3,not to bad,This while not that great was ok. It isnt my favirote movie but it was ok.As you can see this movie is about Santa Claus but then again its about Santa Claws.
2,Thank god I didn't buy this,"I am shocked at how terrible this release is. The first ""famous"" cd was really really good! This however, is not. Terrible track selection on both CD's. Luckily, I picked up a burned copy from a friend.Don't waste your money."
5,SanDisk III,I love my two SanDisk cards. Amazon is a great place to order products. Fast shipping and I should have my new lens today! Amazon is a trusted company in my book.. Thanks..
4,More GBs for More MPs,"Obviously you'll need more storage space if each photo taken has more information. I recently bought me a Canon EOS 5D Mark II, which takes photo at 21.1 megapixels and I am very pleased. Taking a picture using my new camera means each photo has twice the information than those taken with my EOS 40D. A card with 4 MB would fill up too fast. I choose carrying two 8 MB cards over one 16 MB for security, I'll have a back-up in case something goes wrong with my card. Currently, Extreme III seems to be most cost effective, but I will consider getting Extreme IV or faster if I had the EOS 1D Mark III, which can take approximately 10 photos per second."
1,No Warrenty,"After 3 Months of constant emails back and forth trying to get Sandisk to replace my card that *burned* up on me, I am giving up and framing it to go on the wall of my Rental Studio as a warning to never buy Sandisk Products. I'm hopping that at least the dozen of so Photographers that com through the place a week will take the warning and buy something else.This is not Sandisk bashing. I own other 2GB, 8GB, and 16GB cards. But I will never buy another Sandisk product again."
3,"Beautiful, but . . .",". . . childish. Compared to his two most recent films, the story line here is quite a bit less complex, and didn't really interest me. The animation is impressive as usual though, so it's worth a watch before you give it away to someone with kids. There is a fair amount of violence in this one though, including a few scenes involving deaths, so I'm not sure who the intended audience was."
3,Not a Kid's Movie,"We love My Neighbor Totoro and Kiki's Delivery Service. Castle in the Sky seemed to be more of this kind of fair, instead of Spirited Away or even Princess Mononoke. I was shocked at the amount of violence in the story: guns, bazookas, grenades, total destruction and horrific allusions to the A-Bomb. The core of the story is wonderful; however, for younger children or if you prefer to keep violent images out of your household, I urge caution with this film.I enjoyed the movie as an adult, but as a parent, I made an error in showing this movie to my daughter. Wait until you are ready and willing to discuss why robots and people are killing everyone indiscriminately, and what the horrors of war and the struggle for power means."
2,English Dub Pales in Comparison,I was excited about this film at first but was quickly disappointed. For one they changed the title from Laputa to just Castle in the Sky. Laputa refers to the floating island in the classic tale of Gullivers Travels. Which I adore and had hoped Castle in the Sky would pay tribute to it.I thought Pazu's voice was a bit old sounding for him and Anna Paquins voice dub just annoyed me. I would have enjoyed this film more if it weren't for the poor choice of voice actors.The film is gorgeous and for its time it is remarkable. But I feel that it is best viewed in the original Japanese.Castle in the Sky
5,I Like it!,"Ok, so I heard of this movie when I was about...7 on a trailer on the movie 'Kiki's deleviery service"" ( Great movie, I reccomend). I found this in the video section of Target for A suprising $14.00! anyways, I was left stunned when I saw it. It is a wonderful movie with even better animation.Good:(1: Manga drawings(2:In the beginning credits, I like the animation there too(3:Overall story in general(4:Original story line(5:It's somthing I never would have thought of myself!Bad:(1:SHEETA'S GOD-AWFUL VOICE!!! You can hear Anna Paquin's accent in her voice. I don't think Japenese people are supposed to sound like southerners or what not.....(2:One word: GUNS! GUNS,GUNS,GUNS!!! O_O(3: the part where Uncle Pom gets all sad after seeing Sheeta's necklace. How can a rock get'Restless'?!?!!?! <_<Over all, I give it 4 and alot more than just 1/2."
2,Not A Children's Movie,"Apparently most, if not all the reviewers, did not mind subjecting their children to a very violent movie. I do not care what artistic wonder this film may be, it is definitly not a movie for children under 8 or 9 years of age."
2,only not bad for a animation made 17 yrs ago,"if you've seen ""Mononoke Hime"" and "" Sen to Chihiro"" before you see this one, be careful, you'll be quite disappointed with this one, 'cause it can't compare with those two in every aspects, no matter in the whole story, the picture or the music, it's just totally out of date in today's standrd, i had this dvd just because i'm fan of miyazaki's animation, speaking of this dvd alone, it's not worth owning."
2,Hmmm ...,"I did not particularly like this movie. It didn't have very much excitment until the end, by which time I wasn't really paying attention. What else is there to say?"
3,Lacked audio quality,"Being an avid fan of Qawwali, I purchased this product with the thought of listening to one of my favorite Qawwalis by legendary Qawwals.All I have to say is that I was a bit disappointed. I have heard better versions of the same songs by the same artists in other CD's and DVD's. The audio quality was not good, it almost sounded like the Qawwals themselves were distant from the recording and it certainly didn't sound like it was recorded in a studio either."
2,weak handle,my handle has split and I can't find a placeto get a replacement handle or instructionson how to put it on if I can get one
4,Steel Panthers 2 -- Modern Battles,"Steel Panthers 2 is a fantastic improvement over the original of the series, Steel Panthers. Your expanded capabilities are further enhanced by a patch from SSI which corrects some of the games deficiencies.My major problem with Steel Panthers 2 is that the AI is not up to par. The AI is not smart, and has no tactical sense on the offense, but is fairly good on defense. The AI substitutes numbers for tactical sense.There is also an ""artillery cheat"" built into the game (Gary Grigsby games always have the AI cheat) that will pound your hidden units, find units that have not moved or fired, and will hammer your headquarters unit wherever you put it on the map.The expansion battlesets from SSI have added several modern European campaigns to go with the basic campaigns, and there is a bulletin board of scenarios for you to try.Overall, this is my favorite tactical sim. But get the patch from SSI to improve the game."
5,The Mother of all Armor Strategy Games,"Thank you, Saddam, for your ""Mother of - "" contribution to the English Language. And thank you, Ingram Micro, for keeping me up night after night strategizin' and tacticizin' in battles large and small. This game was a blast and still is a blast, even though it's sorely outdated as far as graphics go. But, gameplay is far more important than prettiness, and that's where this game delivers.So far, I haven't found a turn-based modern warfare game with the magic of this one. Whether you're playing a skirmish or a tank battle that makes Kursk look like a sorority slapfight, the range of options in this game is awesome. You can be a lieutenant or a 4-star general.There was a Steel Panthers III, but I never got into it very much. Hopefully they'll crank out a 4 that captures the fun of 2 with better graphics and gameplay.-- JJ Timmins"
3,Don't Judge This By Its Cover,"The cover of this book is great. The contents are somewhat less so. This is an illustrated history with a heavy accent on ""illustrated."" Lots of pictures, many of them quite good, but many others are poorly reproduced and below what one would expect in such a book. The ""history"" portion of the book is superfiscial - if you've read many other books about the Yankees this isn't going to tell you anything you don't already know. I was hoping for a thorough history of the team, but this is mostly re-hash and seems to have been told from accounts in other books. Adequate for what it is, but not comprehensive and certainly not among the best books ever written about the Yankees."
3,Pennants and Pinstripes,"For a sports team that has had more books written about it than any in history, it is admittedly getting more and more difficult to uncover new insights to the Yankees (except for perhaps the pre-1920 teams). So it isn't unfair to say that much of the info covered in this books has been said before. But there are many photos not previously seen--or at least photos that have had very little previous circulation. The book is a very handsome publication and it indeed another library must have for the Yankee fanatic."
5,A Fan's Delight,"This is a wonderful book for all baseball fans. Whether you love the Yankees or hate them, you will be fascinated by the historical insights the writers deliver. Well written, with great photos, this book will provide hours and hours of pleasure. Perusing the book one comes across characters from the past such as Jack Chesbro and Prince Hal Chase, and from more recent times, such as Yogi Berra, Dave Winfield, and Mickey Mantle who make baseball history come alive. Historical anecdotes about how the Yankees got their name and their pinstripes, the history of Yankee stadium, and controversial plays all make this book a delightful source of information for any baseball fan. A great gift!"
5,5 years later...still amazing,"As a late convert to Blackfield and PT, I was amazed when I got to see this video. (Netflix thank you very much) Their live performance was so close to the sound of the studio work, it was amazing. If you're like me, you'll LOVE this DVD too. It must be hard to buy based on the price that is listed for it now ($178??) so at least you might try to 'rent' a copy if you can."
4,Beautifully Derivative,"The best CD The Cure and Cocteau Twins never put out. Those who compare this CD to New Order and Depeche Mode are going in the right direction, but barking up the wrong tree. Junkie is channeling similar, but in my opinion, greater talents. Junkie's collaboration with Robert Smith on A Broadcast From The Computer Hell Cabin was Robert Smith's best song since Disintegration. Musically, this CD is more in the same vein. While this is even further removed from Big Sounds of the Drag and Saturday Teenage Kick, for those of us who grew up listening to late '80s early '90s ""alternative"", this is the closest and best thing you can get to a time machine-your favorite bands updated with a y2k ""techno"" bent. This album may be derivative, but in the best sense. By the way, if you like this CD, old Cure and U2, check out the now defunct Carolyn's Mother from Denver, particulary 30 Pieces of Silver, if you can find it. If you never saw them live, you missed out."
5,A realistic approach to living with diabetes,"Marion Franz, makes the unknown possible. Anyone with diabetes knows what it means to be restrict ed. This book, is a guide to those who chose to live their lives as normal as possible. As anyone who has a disease or has dieted, restrict ing one self too much, can lead to indulgence. Marion Franz gives us the knowledge, to use as a tool, in planning for those special occasions yet, remaining in diabetic tight control. Thank you, for giving me, more freedom of choice!"
3,not her best,"This just doesn't seem to be as satisfying as her earlier historical novels like Brian Boru, etc. It's not bad but I would recommend those instead and also Parke Godwin's historical novels"
3,The Greener Shore,"I have read most everything Morgan Llywelyn has written. This book sort of is a follow on to her book ""Druid"". It is enjoyable and the only reason I gave it 3 stars instead of 4 or 5 is that most of her other books are 5' and this one doesn't quite measure up. Its like you drive a Rolls Royce and then someone gets you to drive a Buick. Well the Buick is really nice but it is not a Rolls, and most of her books are in the Rolls class. I have Brenden qued up for my next read, I am looking forward to that one. The Greener Shore is good but the main character is kind of a woose, sure he has been though a hell of a lot but comeon, Druid up man! Give this one a shot, especially if you already read ""Druid"" it will tie up a few loose ends for you. Its just not the very best."
2,Curious,"It is my impression that Morgan may have written an outline for this book, but I do not think she wrote this book. Having really enjoyed Druids, and all of her other books, I was very disappointed in The Greener Shore. It does not even mimic her usual style very well.Liz"
3,Listen to sample of audio first,"I accidentally ordered the audio book instead of the text version. I love Morgan Llewelyn's work, but something about the accent given the characters by the narrator makes this hard to stay awake to! In a year, I haven't finished the story - it might not be so boring if I were reading it."
4,Works well.,The key thing is cleaning your glass before you apply. Measure twice before you cut.I applied the product in landscape mode. This design is supposed to be in portrait mode. Also the design is too busy. Otherwise for the price this is perfect. See my pictures...
5,stunning,"I put this in my master bath where I have neighbors right on top of me. This looks like the real thing and is the most beautiful of all the window film that I have used in my home. I've used 3 different patterns in different windows and this one is absolutely gorgeous. Very easy to install, couldn't be happier."
1,I did not like this window film,Did not like it .it was not what l through it would be l have not used it still under the rug.
3,"Looks nice, not a good price!",You really dont get enough. I got only enough to do one small window. I love the way it looks so I guess it is a good deal for the fact that it has stayed put for almost a year but other than that it doesnt give you much.
3,"This is a flat design, no texturing.","Previously, we bought the ""Clematis"" theme for our dining room, so we expected a raised design with raised ""leading"" and texturing like the clematis, and were a little disappointed when this design was completely flat. It is pretty, tho, and looks good in the window in the landing of our 2 story house. We also have the type of front door with the half-circle at the top with the clear fan design in it, so I cut pieces to fit the clear fan pattern, and it looks stunning as well as providing privacy. Our house is a 100-year-old farmhouse, but sadly, all of the vintage touches are gone, modernized throughout the years. These window films bring back a little of bygone days, providing an old-fashioned air with little effort, and, considering the cost of real thing, at a very small price."
2,Poor installation instructions,"If you purchase this then ignore the instructions on how to measure. You need to add at least 1cm to your length and width measurements, because when you remove the film from the backing paper it shrinks in by that much. We did not do this and have ended up with a gap on each side. Will need to re-purchase and re-do at a later stage."
4,Beautiful window covering for privacy,"This window covering is very beautiful. I put it on a door panel for privacy - it's not as opague as I thought, but I would still recommend it for privacy. As always, Amazon free shipping is excellent."
5,Wisteria Window Film,This was a gift to my mother and she loves it. Extremely easy to put up and stays on the window. Mom has received numerous compliments and couldn't be happier with it.
4,Easy as can be,Took about an hour to do two windows. They came out pretty well and now we don't see a block wall out the window. I just wish it came in larger sheets so it didn't have a seam.
3,Very pretty,"This arrived very quickly. It is good quality material. When put on window, its really dark on the outside of the window and hard to get all the air bubbles out. (Still working on it) But when the sun shines through it in the day time, the colors look amazing. Just wish it had better curb appeal."
3,"beautifully presented, somewhat interesting","A collection of interesting essays (and representations of her works) on the artist and her life give the reader good, broad and varied sense about who Mary Cassatt was and how important she was in helping America to discover impressionism. MC is an artist that merits to be better recognized and this book serves a good purpose. - Yet for people that have already studied MC and want to learn more on detailed aspects of her art, this book will probably not be sufficient - Griselda Pollock has written a book i found very useful called 'mary cassatt painter of modern women' which has some well-founded arguments about her works and intentions and is very interesting and more original than this collection of well presented and nevertheless good essays."
3,So close . . .,"I'm a semester into a fine arts degree and desperatly searching for a TRUE female role model in the painterly art.Sigh - - - Mary Cassatt ain't it.Sadly, I believe that, Mary Cassatt's only claim to LASTING aesthetic fame is that she is American and FEMALE: not that she had anything unique or new (in her time) to say in her paintings."
2,Very Dissapointed In this Book!,"All I can say is that if you own the Ideal Doll ""2nd"" Edition... Dont Buy The ""3rd""Edition!!! I was so upset when I got this book, it is exactly like the 2nd Edition same pictures and all!!! I was hoping it would share a ""new and different"" version of the clothing and dolls. All I could see that was different is the pricing, but that wont help you much because it all depends on the demand of the item. You can go to Ebay and do a search on ""ended"" auctions to get an idea of what something is going for. Prices change each and everyday."
5,Ideal dolls by Judith Izen,"I love this book, as it has pictures and information for the many dolls I have. My home has many of Ideal Play Pals and now I'm acquiring some of the Toni dolls and what fun, to learn about them and see the outfits, that were made, just for them. Some 55 years ago, I had a Toni and oh how I loved her.This is an awesome reference book, well written and it was shipped in a timely manner."
5,Great chain tensioner,"This chain tensioner is a wonderful product. It keeps the rear wheel from moving forward. Because of that,your chain tension will stay tensioned for areally long time. The onlycon i can think of is that there was no instruction manual included. Installation was easy but i structions still would have been nice. Other than that, great product."
2,Might work for suckas,These things suck. The bend very easily and are super sloppy. I wouldn't put them on anything except a kids bike. I will never buy them again.
5,NOT SURPRISED,"I knew when growing up with Omar on 168th St.and listening to him play drums in his basement that he was destined for greatness.Under the great teachings of his father, who was also my violin teacher in elementary school,I am not surprised at all of his great accomplishments. KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK OMAR!"
1,Flimsy - there are better ones out there.,Look at my other reviews for other meat tenderizers that are made a lot better than this one and would be more worth your while. I say it's flimsy because it's so skinny. Other ones have a wider base and offers more stability when you're stabbing into cuts of meat. This smaller one also means you have to stab the meat a lot more. I say just get the larger one that's more stable and takes less effort.
4,Medium Digital Camera Case,"This the second case of this model in use in our house. We like it because it holds the Canon 850IS camera along with the battery charger and with room for an extra memory card, a thumb drive, and a small card reader. In other words, you can take everything you need on a trip or vacation in one handy size case."
5,"Worth every penny: well made, handy, versatile","Bought this for my Canon SX100 IS camera about a year ago.Well crafted, no loose threads or poorly stitched seams. Top rate materials.+ The case fits the camera perfectly.+ Having both the shoulder strap and belt loop is very handy.+ Storage pocket and pocket-in-a-pocket is perfect for storing extra batteries and SD memory cards.+Case is well padded+Zipper works smoothly, has never jammed or got stuck.From now on, I plan to look to Case Logic for any electronics cases, I'm sold."
4,Very functional,"The case worked great as we traveled through Disney. It held extra batteries and my phone, as well as my cannon."
5,EXCELLENT CLASSIC!,"I've had this CD since it first came out and that's been over 20 years. It is a timeless piece of art to say the least. I've always said if I were stuck on an island and only had 1 CD to listen to for the rest of my life, this would be it. A must have for all true Boricua salsa lovers, enjoy!"
1,Kindle version rife with errors and digitizing problems ~,"Granted it's free... but the Kindle version is full of errors made when digitizing. The format is all over the place making it hard to read the lines in the proper style. Also there are many punctuation errors, including sets of question marks in stead of apostrophes. Such as: (Duke???s Palace) instead of (Duke's Palace).The play itself is great, just go to the Project Guttenberg site for a free version that is better than this. Otherwise spend a little money and purchase the Pelican version:Measure for Measure (The Pelican Shakespeare). It's $7 and it is a WONDERFUL version with essays, interesting forwards, and some footnotes for various terms while maintaining the proper format."
3,"great face wash, silly dispenser","this is a face wash from heaven. for some reason it is the only product that does not give me an allergic reaction. smells great, removes eye makeup...very important.it's inconveniently in a bottle that leaves at least a tablespoon or two of product at the bottom. it requires tremendous effort to remove (inverting it for days and catching it before it falls out as you put it in your hand). you'd think for $35 someone at the company could work this out."
5,Jerry Vale is the best!!!,"This as an incredible three CD set!! Talk about relaxing music!! I play this CD, and only this in my Rolls!!!If you're having a lousy day, just put in Jerry Vale for a while, and all the stress is gone!!!Garrett Valentino"
3,Book as described. Overcharge on shipping multiple items,The book was in good condition however they will ship multiple items in the same package and charge you shipping on each item.
5,Best Photoshop Book!,Best Photoshop book I ever bought. Excellent step by step intructions.95% of what in this book is what I need to use daily.
5,Very useful....,The best book about photoshop so far. Easy to understand and follow. Learned more in a couple of hours than the last months..Tor Gunnar
5,My most used PS book,"If you need to run your photo business instead of becoming an in-depth photoshop expert this is the book for you. It has effective solutions to many common problems we all have with our digital originals. It tells you in a step by step process that is easy to follow. This is more of a fix-it book than a text to give you an in-depth knowledge of Photoshop, but would be a valuable addition to any digital photographers bookshelf."
3,"OK, but not that good if u have the previous edition","As other reviewers have said if you allready own the previous version of this book, then maybe you should think twice before spending money on this edition, some of the techniques are exactly the same. I personally find Kelby's sense of humour a bit irritating, just get on with the techniques and stop pretending being sooooo funny. A little kick here and there is ok, but he spills his ""jokes"" just about everywhere.To the person who complaints about all the creen captures being from macs... Photoshop is VIRTUALLY IDENTICAL in both platforms.To me it seems kelby ran to be the first in publishing a book about Photoshop CS and it clearly shows, less speed and more quality next time.RegardsTeco"
4,Fantastic if you do NOT own the previous edition,"If you have the previous edition of this book, then this new edition will probably not be worth your money for the upgrade: many of the tips have been taken verbatim from the first Photoshop Book for Digital Photographers. But if you have neither the old nor the new edition of this masterpiece by Scott Kelby, then rest assured that some of the included ideas are worth the price of the book itself. I wish I had known about these shortcuts to photo enhancement a long time ago. I find this collection of easy yet powerful tips to be even more useful than Photoshop 7 or CS Down & Dirty Tricks (two other Kelby books I own and like). Work smart, not hard with The Photoshop CS Book for Digital Photographers.I gave this book only 4 stars instead of 5 because I feel that more new material should have been included instead of using so many techniques from the previous edition of this publication."
2,Save your money if you own the previous version,"The bottom line is: Save your money if you own the previous version of this book. Don't get me wrong, this book is a great book IF you don't own the previous version. If you want an update to CS, then this book does little more than repeat info from the user's manual. Scott does not seem to have any insight into using much of CS's new tools like RAW conversion or the Lens Blur filter. If you want to learn how to use the NEW tools in CS, wait for another book like ""Real World Photoshop CS"" to come out."
3,Oh Please,"Mr. Kelby is undoubtedly an expert, but his books generally would be a lot more palatable to serious users if he were not so concerned with trying to be terminally cute. Learning a program like Photoshop is hard work and requires a lot of time. I don't need to be told that that Browser, for instance, takes meals to the needy before I am even told what it does or how it works. Gags like that demean the topic, demean me, and demean the ""needy."" The substance of Mr. Kelby's books is excellent. His pedagological approach sucks."
3,"Cloying and Annoying, some good things","If you can get past Scott Kirby's adolescent patter, there are a number of useful tips on how to use CS effectively for common (and some uncommon) photo manipulation tasks.However, that's all you get. No discussion on what you are doing. This really is for intro level photographers. Katrin Eisman's books are a much better buy. This one you look at once or twice and then stuff away. Eisman's books you keep coming back to."
4,Got to have it,This is a fantastic book for beginners and intermediate persons to Photoshop. The easy to follow instructions are invaluable as you can read and click along!!! A very good buy.
4,Very instructive,I am using The Photoshop CS for Digital Photographers and find it very instructive and Scott Kelby houmor makes it fun to read.Hartvig
1,Stay away from this one!,"Stay away from this one! In order to produce a false wide-screen aspect ratio, this 4:3 film has been stretched to 16:9. It looks ugly and should be unacceptable to any serious viewer. The only improvement over the previously-released DVD is in the audio. This 1938 classic badly needs attention by Criterion or Kino or some other reputable company."
4,Rick's Review,"I didn't like this CD at first, since it's a departure from her previous album. After two listens it grew on me, and I started to appreciate her flow and message on the songs created on this work."
2,Cheap...,"This version is dsappointing for two reasons:a) The image quality is very poorb) Rhere are no language options - this version of an originally Dutch film is provided with an American-English soundtrack only (highly incongruous, given that it's set in Amsterdam).Anyone looking for the Dutch original ""Grijpstra & De Gier"" should search elsewhere."
1,Don't buy this toy,"Caution! In no time flat, my 1 year old knocked two rings out of this tambourine which were affixed with a metal pin. This pin, which fell to the floor, poses not only a choking hazard, but a perforation hazard anywhere along a child's gastrointestinal tract. Unbelievable."
4,30th anniversary Francie Doll,"I love the doll and the outfit. The complaint I have is that the tights are so thick that the shoes have split on the top of both. This did not happen when I put them on, but I noticed the split about two weeks later. I guess my complaint is with the manufacturer, but be extra careful when the shoes are put on. I did contact Mattel, but since the doll is a 1996 issue, they are sorry that they no longer have replacement shoes."
5,Not slowing down for anything,"Released in 1985, a very difficult era for salsa because of the emergence of merengue, with this album El Gran Combo definitely proved salsa was not dead. It includes several of EGC's most memorable tracks as ""La Fiesta de Pilito"" and ""No Hay Cama Pa' Tanta Gente"" a fictitious party that gathers a bunch of famous salseros. I really liked the Christmas-themed ""Arbolito"", which I interpret as a poor child's plea for a Christmas tree or even some lights on the window. Very heart wrenching but, as with much of their music, very danceable. Couldn't leave without mentioning my favorite track, ""Desenfunda"" another highly danceable and musically sound track. This album will give you another reason as to why El Gran Combo continue to be one of the public's favorite groups."
5,El Gran Combo Nuestra Musica,What a great Album- classic!..quintessential Xmas Salsa music...really gets you in a feel good Holiday mood and one of their best albums all around!
3,Nice watch,"Know that the face of the watch looks like it's white, but it's really stainless steel...and as such, harder to read.Still, it's a good watch, it seems to be accurate and will certainly do the job. Good watch for the money, certainly.Fast shipping no problem at all with the vendor.strongv"
4,In the fullness of time . . .,"Purchased three of these as gifts. Seemed like a lot of watch for just a little money. So far, none has been returned. :0)"
5,Very nice watch,Its as per the specification mentioned. quality and look is good. Great value for price. My father just love it
3,Nice multi-function watch,"It's not the most stylish watch available, but it had all the features I was looking for. It's a bit large and clunky, but better than most watches these days where that's concerned. It's not very intuitive, though. Every time I have to re-set the time, it's back to the manual to figure out the complicated process all over again. Plus, like many electronic clocks these days, you can only set it forward. Which means if it runs a minute or two ahead you just tend to live with it and subtract in your head rather than go through the slow several-minute process of setting it forward 24 hours to get it backwards two minutes to the correct time. And I can't for the life of me figure out the dual stopwatch feature. Maybe it's just me... but to be honest I have a pretty high IQ. At any rate, it does what I want with a minimum of trouble, so I can't say I'm dissatisfied... just not thrilled."
3,good...except for the battery,"i bought this watch a few months ago, and up until now have been very pleased with it. i've taken it snorkling, waterfall diving, mountain biking, climbing, hunting, and even alligator wrestling, and aside from a few minor scratches on the plastic face, it has operated flawlessly and accurately, and it looks nice as well. unfortunately, after only 8 months, the battery has stopped working, and having a new battery installed costs almost as much as the watch..."
4,A pretty solid watch,"This is a solid and metallic watch which the value should much over $20. The background of the watch is silver rather than white as shown in the picture and it make it more valuable. The watch is easy to read and easy to adjust.Slight adjustment on the metallic band is easy. However, if you need to have a bigger adjustment, you need to dissemble the metal pieces of the band require certain skills and tools. I need to find the instruction from the internet and take an hour to do the adjustments. The metal pieces are hard to pull and need a proper pliers.Overall, I love this watch and the quality is over my expectation."
2,decent while it lasted,"the watch claims to have a 10 year battery. i would have been satisfied with at least half of that but the watch died in one year and three months. it is a hassle to program the time, daylight savings was always a pain. i always had to either pull out the manual or look up directions online. lack of contrast makes it a bit more difficult to tell time. it is fairly cheap, so i guess you get when you pay for."
2,Difficult to read,"This is a beautiful watch and should have been a good buy, but after wearing it for three days, I gave it away to my grandson. (Returning it would have been more hassle and UPS charges would have been a waste. He didn't have a watch so. . .)There were two problems:-In the dark, the light on the watch did not illuminate either the hands or the digital section adequately. That made the watch unreadable.-Even in light, the hands are so nearly the same color as the face that it is difficult to read. More contrast would have improved things."
4,Good looking watch,"Its not too heavy,and it doesn't look cheap like the newer square model. Only problem is the I have a small wrist and the band is pretty stiff."
4,Excellent Time Piece - Do Not Lose the Manual,Pros:Feature rich.Keeps excellent time.Nice looking.Cons:Dim light that stays lit for only one second.Has 4 buttons that you use to control all those nifty features so you better not misplace the manual.Gave it only four stars because of the complexity of feature use and the dim light.
1,you get what you pay for,"On a computer screen, it looked pretty good. And in fact, when i got it, i have to say that i was initially pleased considering the price i paid for it. When it came to real day to day use, this watch is a clunker. First off, the analog screen and time hands have such low contrast, that it takes a few seconds to really see the time. Why would they design it this way - silver hands on a silver face??? Then setting the time is a detailed, annoying process. Once i figured it out, it was fine, then recently, when he went into daylight savings time, i was able to set the digital time, but now, i cannot set the analog time as one of the buttons seems to be sketchy!!!! Highly NOT recommended."
3,Watch Light Too Dim,"Overall this seems to be a decent watch for the money. It looks pretty good and works well so far. But my biggest gripe is that the back light is useless. It is so dim that viewing the watch in dark environments is impossible. I hate to knock off two stars in the rating for this, but it's a huge deal to me. When it's even a little dark, the watch essentially becomes a bracelet. Too bad."
3,Decent watch for the price,"I bought this watch to replace another Casio that lasted for 10 years.The Good:The metal band has reasonably fine length adjustments.The watch face is easy to read.The back light works very well.It is fairly inexpensive.The Bad:This watch doesn't keep time quite as well as the previous Casio; it loses ~30sec/month.Most of the features are fairly worthless.The Very Bad:The case of the watch is plastic, not stainless steel as reported in the description. I probably would have given it 4 stars is the case actually matched the description."
5,great watch!,"Got it very quickly as I do most Amazon items. Watch is exactly as indicated and works perfectly. They do NOT mention that it has a built in light, which is handy at night. For me it is the ideal analog/digital as I use zulu time in ham radio!"
2,alarm is so polite that it can hardly be heard,"If you are buying this watch for it's alarm feature---forget it. It can barely be heard if you are wearing it. The digital portion of the face is hard to see as there is a shadow cast by the upper part of the display. The general appearance of the watch is appealing. A call to Casio for assistance with the alarm problem provided no help. I returned this product and purchased a Timex IronMan, as suggested by a Timex representative. This watch provides an audible alarm that meets my needs."
3,Hands too close to face color,The similarly colored hands and face make quick time telling more of a chore than it should be.
3,Wrist band too large,The watch was what I expected and very nice for the price. The wrist band was too large for my wrist and I had to get a watch repair shop to shorten it -- cost almost as much as the watch.
4,Nice watch for the price!,"I owned a similar Casio watch for ten years. Very durable and very reliable, which led me to purchase this one. This model is a little more complicated to operate....I'm still working on learning how to activate the different features. The only real drawback so far is the alarm is not very loud. My older one had a great alarm - you could hear it in the next room. Over all I am pretty pleased with the watch."
4,I really like the look,"I wear a Casio watch with plastic buckle watchband everyday for working in. Have woren the same model for many years and have very good service from them. So when it came time to look for a watch that I could wear out on nice occassions I looked for the same same quality with a fashionable look. I found it in this watch. I like the feel of this watch, large analog face and all the same digital function that I have on my watch I wear in the field everyday. I would highly recommend this watch to anyone looking for this style of watch"
2,Casio AW80D-7A Watch,"Delivery prompt and description accurate. Watch face hard to read. The face appeared white in photograph but is silver, a line of watch descriptors across the middle of the watch is easily confused with the low contrast analogue hands. Illumination near useless. Moderately difficult to adjust band. Setting digital time and other functions not intuitive for me."
2,Great watch in the light,I love the watch as long as there is plenty of light.Unfortunately it is unreadable in the dark even with the backlight.
4,Casio Men's AW80D-7A Sports Chronograph Alarm 10-Year Battery Databank Watch,I have had mine now for over 9 months and wear it while working. It's a great hard wearing watch that keeps the time well. Excellent value for an everyday watch!
4,price is good for the product,"The price is just about right. The digital time is independent of the hands which is annoying the light is barely usable the band will pull your arm hairs and the controls aren't intuitive at all. That being said it is a perfect and perfectly nice looking $22 watch. I wouldn't buy another one but I'm happy with the one I have. I'm just a little annoyed with some features that have all been worked out on other similarly priced watches and I feel they (back lighting, chronograph controlled by digital, well engineered interface, etc.) should be standard at this point. It's not like this is a sophomore effort by a fledgling company! 4/5 for price and look."
4,Honest opinion,"This Casio watch is pretty decent. Although the plastic around it does make it look a little tacky. Also theres no way to turn off that 'click' sound the watch makes. Also to turn the hand on clock manually is rather slow. However, overall the illuminated light nicely lights up, and the digital part which shows the date or the time is very useful. Thumbs up =)This watch does have a good value to it."
3,Could be better,"The first watch I received, I had to return because the pin snapped and broke the bottom of the ""plastic"" face, while trying to have the band adjusted. The only advantage I see to ordering this watch through Amazon is that you save a few bucks buying it from Wal-Mart, who has the same watches, just in different shapes and face colors."
3,You get what you pay for,"OK watch for the money. The light for the dial is useless for the dial and/or the digital display, not properly angled to provide illumination so that you can read the dial/display.Otherwise does OK."
4,Do I need ALL of this stuff?,"Nice looking watch for daily use, and is easy to read. It is almost incredible what capabilities this watch has, especially at this price-point. BUT, it comes with an instruction book, of about 50 pages, written in type so small you need to an Eagle to read it, and a 175 IQ to remember it. I'm still trying to figure out how to keep the alarm from going off at Midnight."
2,too complicated,"Casio Watch has too many dials and knobs and poor directions for the average non-technical person to handle. Impossible user manual. Had to return for a simpler watch that tells the day, date, and time.May be a good deal for those who know how to use it."
3,CASIO Databank,"I think is viewed this item in a store. The watch I viewed at the store didn't have enough contrast for me to read the time without using my glasses. On your websitr, I wish I could have a (1) Larger view (2) Better color view of this watch."
1,tragic!,"If one wants to study the mind of Mossad, or is particularly interested in paranoid thought processes, this is for you. It's the kind of book you should be paid to read, rather than pay for."
5,Six Stars,"I'd give this book six stars if I could. Fantastic summary of the evidence that Saddam's Iraq underwrote the 9/11 attacks and was ready to attack again. Despite the somewhat lurid subtitle, it also deals responsibly with the disturbing conclusion that the U.S. intelligence and counterintelligence establishment (CIA, FBI, State Department) utterly failed in their task of protecting America from its enemies. Buy this book if you have an open mind and want to better understand why the liberation of Iraq was absolutely necessary for America's national security. If it weren't for Laurie Mylroie, there wouldn't be anyone else doing the hard investigative work and pulling all the strands together for the non-specialist reader."
5,The BFG is cool,spoiler alert!!!!!The BFG is A good book. The BFG is short for The Big Friendly Giant.The BFG eats snozzcumbers.The BFG is the only nice giant.In the book their are nine giants.The BFG talks funny because he did not go to school.Anthony
4,Allie's Review,"Imagine you were a young orphan tossing and turning because you can't sleep. Then all of the sudden a big, giant hand comes in through your window and lifts you out of your bed! The next thing you know you are bouncing around in a wool pocket.The BFG was a great book. The orphan, Sophie, was actually in the BFG's (Big Friendly Giant) pocket. He took her off the map of London to his giant land. There grazing on a huge feild, was nine gross looking giants.I can compare my dad and I to the BFG and Sophie. One time when I was standing near the pool, I accidently stepped backward and almost fell in. The reason I didn't was because my dad caught me. It reminds me of when the BFG helps Sophie when she is in need and Sophie helps the BFG when he is in need.The book was about how Sophie and the BFG try to save the children of the world from getting eaten up by those nine disgusting giants. Can they help the world? Find out if they can and how they do it by reading the book the BFG."
3,The BFG is a nice and kind giant,"SPOILER ALERT!!!The story took place in England.The BFG is a nice,kind, and funny giant he is not like the other giants he is also bad at grammar.I watched the movie but thebook has more details.Sophie got kidnapped by the BFG.The BFG ate snozzcumbers and Sophie got grossed out.All the other giantsate human beings.The queen got a dream that giants were getting eaten by giants.They tried to get rid of the giants and when they did they put the giants in a big hole.Aldrich"
3,A delightful little book,"Though I am a large Dahl fan, and thought that this book was completely charming, I admit I don't consider it as good as most people. For some reason I find his other children's books, such as ""The Witches,"" ""Matilda"" and ""The Twits"" much more creative and enjoyable. However I do realize that this is a much beloved book to a good number of people, and I hope it is still enjoyed in years to come."
5,A BOOK WITH REALLY COOL WORDS!,Our second grade class read this book together and thought it was AWESOME! The words that the BFG used were hilarious. You will laugh when you find out what FROBSCOTTLE and WHIZZPOPPERS are! This book will definitely be on your favorite book list.
5,The BFG,"The BFG by Roald Dahl was one of the best books I read during fourth grade. This book was extremely funny, and really fun to read. It was about a little girl and a big friendly giant. That is how the giant got his name, the BFG. As you know from the giant's name, he is very friendly, unlike the other giants that are bigger and ugly. The little girl helps the giant stop the other giants from eating children, after she gets taken away from her home by him. She is taken to another land where the BFG lives, along with the other mean giants. They might eat her if the BFG doesn't take good care of her and keep her hidden. In this book, the BFG and the little girl go through lots of wild things getting to know each other.I have always loved all of the Roald Dahl's books and I think this was one of his best that I read. If someone came up to me to ask what book they should read, I would say to try to read The BFG."
3,The BFG - Not the greatest,"I've read almost all of Roald Dahl's books and let me tell you, this one isn't his best. A little girl meets a giant who is bullied by other giants. Together they try to stop the other giants."
4,BEST BOOK,this book about a dream blowing giant is awsome! It's one of the best i've ever read it's funny and cool at the same time! you won't want to put it down!
5,ENTICE YOUR YOUNG READER,"I HAVE A 9YR. OLD GODCHILD WHO READS ON A SIXTH GRADE LEVEL. SHE WAS CONVINCED THAT THIS WAS A BOY BOOK, AND DIDN'T WANT TO READ IT. I TOLD HER IT WAS FUNNY, AND SHE'D LAUGH. SHE TRIED HARD NOT TO, BUT ENDED UP HIDING UNDER HER PILLOW WITH GIGGLES. SHE AND I ARE ENJOYING EVERY PAGE!"
4,It's A Pretty Good Book,"This review is written by my daughter:It's a good book. I don't know Daddy, you write it. That wasn't part of the review! I'm serious Dad! Please! Just write it for me! I don't want to write this review. I don't know what to write. To everybody who is reading this review, my dad is typing it, and I want him to stop. Stop for serious, Dad. You can write it Dad. I want you to delete this review and you can start it again. I want you to delete what you just wrote because I want you to write it. Dad, I have a paper airplane with an edge and I'm going to poke your eye out if you don't delete this. With a sharp edge. With a pointy edge. Okay, Dad, I'm going to do it."
2,The BFG Review,"The BFG was a very interesting book about a little girl named Sophie who gets kidnapped by a giant(The BFG) during the Witching hour. Fortunately for Sophie, the BFG is a nice giant, unlike his neighbors. They are HUGE giants that eat human beans. When the BFG tells Sophie thet the other giants are off to eat human beans, Sophie is determined to stop them. Will they achieve their goal?I think that the BFG was silly, but there was one thing I hated. Frobscbble, Whizzpoppers, and Snozzcumbers are not words. This a VERY non-educational book. There are some really good young readers out there and they do not know a lot of words yet. If you teach them made-up words, they are going to think those are real words. This is the exact book to screw a kid up."
3,Not Dahl's best,"Sure, there's one Big Friendly Giant, but I couldn't get past all the others trampling around the world gobbling kiddies from their beds in the middle of the night.The payoff for reading about these horrors is not much, compared with Dahl's other work."
4,The Big Friendly Giant,"The BFG is the best fantasy book I've ever read. It was all about adventure in it. There was lots of humor when it came to the BFG himself. The little orphan, Sophie, was really interesting too. She helped us go through the life of a typical orphan. The BFG was a wonderful book to read for young readers everywhere!"
5,The most lovable characters EVER...,"The BFG is my favorite character ever. One day he snatches little Sophie out of bed and takes her to giant land. Lucky for her the BFG is unlike his neighbors and does not eat little boys and girls for breakfast and dinner. While eating snozzcumbers and blowing dreams through his window, the BFG and Sophie must stop the other 9 canibully giants from eating the children."
5,Wonderful book,"We bought as a Christmas gift this for our son who will be 5 in Feb. He absolutely loved it. i was a little worried that he wouldn't stay interested in it long enough, but he was excited to read a chapter or two every night. A great book!"
5,awsome book yet!,wow this book was great! i really liked the humour and the creativity.where does Roald Dahl get all these great ideas its terrific!!!!!
5,GREAT BOOK ONE OF THE BEST I'VE EVER READ,"this book was funny, and made sense unlike some books i've read. i'd reccomend it for all ages. one of daul's best books. another thing i like about it is, it keeps you awake, and you want to read more."
5,Perfect for reading in an airplane,"This book is about a girl called Sophie. A big, friendly giant (the BFG) grabs her out of her bed. Then the giant takes Sophie to his cave and that's when they start to get to know each other. They talk about what the giant eats and more. The BFG tells Sophie that the other giants eat people but that he was the one who caught the dreams so the kids could dream. I liked the book a lot. I'd give it five stars. The more you read it, the better it gets. Perfect for reading in an airplane or just for fun. I recommend it."
3,the bfg,I think the movie is beter than the book .The book wasent so good. It takes place in giant country.One day in engend the bfg was caching dreams. then soghy saw the bfg. she was so frightend. when she saw the bfg.The bfg stuck his hand in her window.Then soghy was hideing under the cover when the bfg grabed her.Then they where in giant country but all of the other giants arnt as friendly as the bfg. the other giant's eat other kids.There are alot of other giants.
3,Damaged Cover,I bought this book brand new and it came with the cover bent in half... I have had good luck with things from Amazon before but this was disappointing. The book is amazing though! A great children's novel for any age.
5,bfg is fighting the bad giants,"BFG is a cool story. The conflict is that the other giants are eating people and that is bad. The resolution is that the BFG'S friend Sophie,so she tells the queen and she sends soldiers to capture the bad giants. The main characters are Sophie,BFG,and the Queen. The plot is that Sophie and the BFG are rescuing the people from the bad giants. The setting is in England and Giant country. I think that this book is intresting."
3,the bfg,The book is about a gaint that steals a girl from a orphanage because if he doesn't take her away she might tell every one and try to get him and put him in a zoo.This book takes place in gaint in giant country and in England.Then they try to get the other giants because they where eating humans.And they did catch them.Leonel
4,Best BOOK EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"SPOILER ALERT!! If you haven't read it don't read this then.The BFG is the coolest book I'v ever read.Lots of people should read this book.It first took place in Englend then went togiant country where the giants live.The giants go to differnt places or the same place to eat people.Theres a person named Jack that the giants are afraid of because he kills giants.A girl named Sophie saw the BFG while he was blowing dreams into kid's windows.She was really frightend when she first saw him,but when the BFG took her to his cave they became friends.Then Sophie told the Queen of Englend about the giants. Then she told the air force and army about the giants.They put the giants in a giant hole.Angelo"
5,Another Roald Dahl Masterpiece by Liam Walsh,"I loved the humor. I loved all the interesting, humorous, information. Where does Roald Dahl get all those creative ideas? Roald Dahl is my favorite author. Yet again I am amused a lot. I loved hearing all thse interesting facts about the BFG. I guess Roald Dahl never fails. Roald Dahl is my favorite author, and it will always be that way."
5,WONDERFUL!!!,"I bough this book for my oldest grandson. I read it when it arrived and I would recommend it for adults as well as for children. I thoroughly enjoyed this book, as did my grand son. Thank you."
4,It was a funny and great book,The Bfg is the funniest book i have ever read i hope almost every one reads this book because the way the Bfg talks and the expressions about the snozzcumber that it taste nasty and the way he discribes the other giants as a nasty feelings and I just like the book I do not like to read but sinse I started reading the Bfg now I like to read Roald Dahl books.
5,An Interesting Story,"The BFG is a really fascinating story about a girl and a giant. The action starts when Sophie, an orphan, sees the Big Friendly Giant, who ""kidsnatches"" her and takes her to his mysterious cave. The BFG says she must live with him forever. That is how their adventure together begins.I think The BFG is the most interesting story in the world. It describes the characters very well and makes me laugh a lot. I didn't want to stop reading.I love all of Roald Dahl's writing, but The BFG is my favorite book. It even inspired me to write my own version!"
5,Awesome Book!,"The BFG is a good use of imagination. I have read many books by Roald Dahl and think he is one of the greatest writers of books for children. The BFG is a great example because it has incredibly interesting characters that children can relate to, it is funny, creative and a little scary."
5,The BFG's dreams,"The BFG loves to blow dreams into young children's homes. He has tens of thousands of dreams. In the whole book he only gives two people Trogglehumpers. Trogglehumpers are nightmares. One Trogglehumper was for the Fleshlumpeater and one was for the Queen of England. The Trogglehumper for the Fleshlumpeater was just for fun and the one for the Queen was so she would know there was ""nine filthy man eating brutes"" that were galloping off to various countries. This is how the BFG gets out his messages."
5,Great book to read could'nt put it down,in this mind capturing book a mumbling giant and a little orphan girl come together as a team.The BFG and the little girl try to persuade the ravenous people eating giants to stop their ways but need to do more.At the same time the BFG does his dream catching job he learns to speak with the little orphan girl.Can they save England from the wretched giants?Thats for me to know and you to find out when you read thie incredible book the BFG.
1,THE BFG's END,This book was not ineresting. I wasn't really into the book. there was too many conversation in the book.The book really didn't tell you what was happening. The book was plain not much was happening in it.I didn't really like sophie in the book. In the book she keeps bad mouthing the rouge giants. She also tries and tries to stop the rouge giants.I would put more gore and violence in the book bceause it is plain and that would spice it up.I would recomend this book for little kids because it is plain and there is nothing bad in it.
1,Read me!!!,I thought this book was not good or bad it was not even close to bad it was worse it was a stupid book. its about a giant who eats stupid snozzcumbers and not meat it really isnt good.as you can see or read. He doesent eat any kids or adults. if i could change something about this book id change the giant to be a meat eater.
1,Arrived weeks late.,"This was scheduled to arrive no later than August 16th. Despite repeated attempts to contact Amazon, it arrived September 2nd, and I had to go to the post office to get it. It was for my daughter's birthday, and arrived weeks after her birthday. It is a great book, but Amazon's service was dreadful."
2,"great spoon rest, not so great Amazon","These spoon rests are nicely designed. They look great displayed and are sturdy and functional in use. My wife loves them. For the spoons, five stars.However, for anyone who likes to collect the different designs (there are four or five flower designs and another four or five fruit designs in the Portmeirion line), Amazon does a terrible job selling these. They not that there are assorted motifs, but not letting customers select which design we would like pretty much rules me out from buying one of these from Amazon. My wife already has several and would like to complete the collection. The local store that she used to buy from doesn't sell them anymore, and Amazon gives no customer choice at all. Is it too much to give customers a choice in designs and patterns?"
3,Not like picture,"I received this product and although very nice it does not look like the picture, the flowers on the spoon rest are a pink color and I wanted the yellow as shown in the picture. Rather than return the item I will keep as a gift to give someone but very disappointed."
1,Never worked and I bought two,"The CD player did not work, so I returned it and ordered a second one. That did not work either. The radio did work. So it was an immense inconvenience of three weeks or so. Finally I just went to a brick and mortar store and bought a name brand (Sony) that has been working great. Amazon handles returns with ease, efficiency and speed, so I would use Amazon to buy name brand electronics despite my experience."
3,Excelent,"Excelente definitivamente recomiendo este producto, especial para la musica ambiental en ares pequeñas, un producto muy bersatil."
2,Not Worth It.,"The first one I bought stopped working a couple weeks after I got it. They sent me a new one. I haven't used it much at all, unfortunately, so I can't comment too much on its playability. Last I checked, it worked fine. But the headphones that come with it are pure junk. I mean, seriously, they literally fell apart almost without even touching them. Weird, but true. The plastic that these headphones are made of must be the cheapest material known to man for it to have cracked in half and fallen apart the way that it did. Thus, I'd call this product a definite avoid."
1,Decker Diarhea,"Okay, one more time. Let's say it together. ED DECKER IS A LIAR. If you want to know about Mormonism, go talk to a converted member. Ask them about how long they studied and how they felt about their conversion. If anyone wants to learn more about Mormonism, read a Book of Mormon!!!"
5,Great book,This book is a perfect beginner piano book. My daughter and her piano teacher are doing great with it. The book arrived in a timely matter and in good condition.
3,Great learning book,Came quick but bought used and full of little kid writing. Had to go through and erase.Good book for learning
3,Average.,A little advanced for a younger child thats just trying to learn some simple popular songs. Perhaps later she will get more into it.
5,Perfect for a young student,"I chose this book to teach a 6 year old new student. It's a wonderful book because it progresses slowly- each page introduces one new concept and has the child practise it in small steps. It is perfect because the child does not become overwhelmed. The illustrations are really nice too. And the print is big and spacious-looking. You can also get it with a CD that goes along with it for $1 more.After ordering the Usborne book here and finding it crowded and confusing, I went to my local music store and picked this book out of all the beginning piano books. It's a really nice one."
5,Paiano Lesson Book 1A,This book contains very simple lessons for the new beginner piano student. Get all the basics down from the very beginning and play some easy fun songs.
3,A dissappointment,"I am a very big fan of Elaine Fox. I own her two previous books and love them so when I saw her third book I instantly bought it w/out even knowing what it was about, but le me tell you that it was a huge dissappointment. The book is not even nearly as funny as the other two and the plot wasnt that good. It got to the point where I was like ""Can they just hook up and stop the nonsense"". If you havent already read the ""Man at Work"" and ""Maybe Baby"", I urge you to do it and id you have then lets just wait for her next book and hope that its a good one."
1,bonton,"I am very disappointed in this book. It is the 2nd most terrible romance novel i've read. It's soo boring and throughout this book, it's scene after scene of Connor and Anne arguing about why the split up and why Anne dumped Connor. It gets to a point I felt like saying out loud to Annet - Just tell Connor why you broke up! This is my first Elaine Fox novel and I will never buy another book and will be the last one"
4,Enjoyable Reading,"This was a very good book. I only gave it a 4 because most of the time I give a 5 only to a book I can't get out of the chair before I finish it, the same day I start it. I did enjoy very much reading about the miraculous events in this book. I couldn't wait to get back to it to find out what was going to happen when they found the Ark of the Covenant, assuming they were going to find it."
5,Dekker is awesome!,"Would recommend anything by Ted Dekker. He is one of the most talented fictional writers out there! Most of his work leans towards thriller...but this book, and the previous (Blessed Child) are so totally different. Really challenged my walk with the Lord, in a positive way! Very encouraging, enlightening, and captivating.An excellent read!Read Blessed Child first."
2,"Misleading title, borrowed melodies","""The Benedictine Chimes of Westminster"" provides the listener with a good performance of bells and organ. None of the songs however, sound remotely ""Benedictine"" or even British. This listener recognized several popular tunes from late nineteenth century America, and one that sounded much like part of a well-known movie soundtrack, though no credit was given to the original composers. My grandmother would have loved it."
4,A MIRROR OF LIFE FOR THE FEW,"Like everything else in life, this book tells about sad times and happy times due to the fact that a military man was awarded the highest honor for valor this nation offers. This book gives descriptions of the battle event that was reponsible for the medal for a number of veterans from the Civil War through Viet Nam. The writing is interesting and points out what some men are capable of when their back is against the wall. If you like war stories, this is a winner."
2,A major disappointment,"I couldn't wait to read this book. Any book which honors the actions of our veterans is a ""must read"" for me. But I was greatly disappointed by this work. While I enjoyed Mr. Wallace's introductory essays, I was confused by the politically correct agenda he presented in the selection of some those who earned the Medal of Honor. Also, Mr. Mikaelian's prose is awkward and laborious: I didn't think it possible to take such incredible acts of bravery and make them almost tedious, but this is exactly what happens here. Spend your valuable time reading well-written books like ""Flags of Our Fathers"" or ""Ghost Soldiers,"" which give proper homage to the legacy of American heroes. Mikaelian's book does not do them justice."
2,Political motivated,"I've spent the last 20+ years in the military and I really enjoy reading about our military heroes. But, it bothers me when someone uses the military to espouse their political ideology. I don't know anything about Allen Mikaelian, but I'd guess he was very unhappy with the presidential election in 2000 and felt he needed to do something. The author selectively picks recipients that provide a positive image of the left wing and a negative image of the right wing. There is nothing wrong with highlighting minority or women recipients. I think that is great and much needed, but the author should have been up front with the title and foreword and should have left out the political propaganda. Instead he covertly gives the impression that these 11 individuals represent your typical CMH recipient, both historically and politically. This book definitely has some value, but unless your polical views are a little far to the left, you may get a bit irritated at the political rhetoric."
3,1970's marathon swimming at its finest,This is an interesting read from back in the heydays of marathon swimming. Back in the days pre total immersion and you just went to the pool and pounded out yard. Back when Nautilus weight training was all the rage. It shows some 70's women's lib for a chapter or two as she was big in the movement. Overall a good book from the era. It was pre Key West to Cuba swim. Interesting in that she didn't make it then nor on her latest attempt 30 years later. The strokes have changed but the challenge has not.
3,chargerfor digital camera battery,just glad to have a charger. will put it to the test the next week on a little trip to the park
1,Not Working,"Received product as noted, put dead battery in and the light just stayed green. Would not charge the battery at all. After playing around with a voltmeter, found out that the leads are connected backwards to the output... -4.20 Volts at .6 Amps doesn't work so well for charging a battery. After finally getting the case open and switching the leads, shut the thing up, plugged it in, and almost had a heart attack, I had shorted out the input pretty much straight from the wall (the flip plug mechanism is a bit sensitive, I bent one of the connectors when I took the case apart). So to make a long story short, if it doesn't work just box it up and return it. I was not impressed with the quality of product or the circuit board to be honest either. Looked like shoddy soldering, and obviously carelessly put together."
4,Audrey is back,"Audrey tries to connect to her fame when she was a teenage star. This dance track does it very well, but sometimes you think it isn't herself. If you like Sarah Connor, go for this. If you look for the old Audrey, this is probably not what you expected. But she has to grow up too , so give her a chance."
4,Garmin c580,Bought this for my daughter and she loves it. Easy to use and gets her where she is going very easily. Very easy to operate. Love the hands free calling feature as well. Great value.
3,GARIN StreetPilo c580,"It is a great tool for drivng around strange cities. My only regret is that MSN is only in 100 big cities and so weather, gas prices, movie times etc. do not work where I live. Make sure you check out the MSN network before you buy the extended subscription. But I do love my Garmin."
4,Good value,"I upgraded from a first generation Garmin. The difference in speed was amazing. Typical direction/routing tasks perform well. After an upgrade the system provided traffic alerts. I'm not sure if this is from Garmin or the Microsoft systemThe Microsoft information is okay, but I am in a fringe area, so it is not always up to date.I had some major problems with the Bluetooth connection. It turned out to be a hardware problem. The unit was exchanged quickly by Garmin. After a couple phone calls to Verizon, Motorola, and Garmin, the Bluetooth function is working very well. I can look at recent inbound and outbound calls and see the entire phone book on the unit...cool."
2,Customer Service Nightmare,"I really like the product... When it works. I have had it 2 months and have had to return it to the factory 3 times because it will just not turn on (yes, I charge it). Garmin has sent me new ones each time and each time the same problem occurs, leading me to believe it is a defect in the product. I just got my 3rd one. Hope this one lasts or I'm just going to demand my money back."
4,garmin as gift,This product was given to my brother for his birthday. He was very happy - especially with the phone connection feature. I would have liked some proof of purchase document from the seller.
4,Overall a good deal,Overall this is a good deal - you get a Garmin with most of the new features except it's a little bulky (no issue for me but may be for some). The only concern I have with it is that it's a little slow acquiring signal - at times it's taken up to a few minutes which is annoying when you want to start driving and aren't sure which way to start out.
4,Garmin c580,"I am pleased with the Garmin c580. It is very easy to use and the display works very well. I really can't say much for the MSN Direct part of this unit. I find it totally useless as far as real time traffic updates. It is however handy for finding places to eat, etc. I got a good price on this unit so I don't feel that I over paid for something that I rarely use."
5,best gift ever!,was a birthday gift and an excellent choice. works great just as described and was a big hit!
4,Very good device.,"I liked this unit very much except for the bulkiness. I returned it and I'm looking for a gps device that does the same things, but is more compact. Bluetooth is a great option on this unit."
1,GPS Went bad in three days,"I had to return the item, the GPS went bad in three days. May be I was unlucky."
1,Garmin Street Pilot c580,I was very disppointed with the Garmin Street Pilot c580 the unit only worked for 1 day and I could no longer power it back on again. I have owned a Garmin Street Pilot 330 for 2 years and never had a issue. I was suprised to recieve a defective product. I wanted to upgrade but now I will just contiune to use what I currently have.
4,Great GPS system!,"This is a great product. It is very easy to use and geting the updated 2009 maps was free and easy. I wish the traffic/delay alerts were better but I think part of it is that traffic in Atlanta is often because of volume and not due to accidents or construction. If there is no incident reported you often don't know that there is traffic until you are in it. Also the MSN Direct service is limited to larger cities so if you are too far away from one you don't get that service and sometimes the signal is weak even when you are near a major city.All in all I really am happy I purchased this unit and it has been very useful both around town and on multi-state trips. I would recommend this unit if you are in an area MSN Direct services (it is free for the first year)as the weather, gas prices and movie times are a nice function especially out of town."
4,Traffic jam,"I really like my Garmin. I personally wanted a GPS system that was small and compact. The screen is smaller than other models but I did not have a problem seeing the menu icons. It comes with a carrying case and the window mount easily comes off which is important against theft. The menu icons are easy to see and follow. I love how it tells you the street names before you approach them. The only problem I have with it is that the traffic feature sometimes loses reception and therefore doesn't work. Also, traffic does not appear on the normal map screen. It's a separate map you have to go through the menu to find. Otherwise, it's a great product."
5,GPS,older unit but still works great and its a hands free unit so you can talk on your cell phone while driveing
3,Good GPS,Bought this a while ago but still like it...Reliable Garmin performance...Liked it a lot w/ MSN Direct...Bulky if you compare to the current product range...
5,One of the Most Unbelievable Devices,I received my StreetPilot yesterday and by evening all phases were working. It does all that the descriptions tell us about and couldn't be easier to set up. My Motorola phone works great with the Bluetooth.
4,great buy,"I bought this item on sale at the end of the year and got a great price. The software is good and the screen size works for me. The POI's are good but could use some updates. The satilite link takes a bit of time to lock on after the unit has been off for a few days or in the rain and under cover but once locked on it works like a charm. The MSN Direct service is the best thing about this unit, I get realtime traffic updates and auto avoidance. IT also has all local weather and forecasts plus local gas prices and directions. I think this make the Garmin perfect for traveling or in your local area. The only suggestion is check the product site to see if your local area is supported, if not I might suggest a newer unit or a thinner one with a bigger screen. I think this is a best buy for travelers because of the size and features."
4,Great product for the price,"This is my 4th GPS, but my first for car use only.Great item, quick signal pick up. Sound quality is the only minus. Very good value."
5,Easy to use,The product is very easy to use even for someone like me who had never dealt with a GPS before. The start up is really straighforward and requires no expertise. When I had to install maps from other locations (outside the U.S) it was also simple and the internal memory made it possible to install other maps without having to insert a dedicated SD card.
4,Very good but not great,"The c580 is great but the MSN service could be better. For example, it lists gas prices in the area but does not give the name of the station."
1,Poor Customer Service makes Garmin a no-no,"The c580 is an adequate product in terms of GPS capabilities but suffers from the following problems:(MAJOR Issue)1) Poor Customer Support (Read - if its breaks - you're on your own)The suction mount on my GPS stopped working (GPS would fall off) and I promptly called the number given on the manual to get it replaced under warranty. The lady who picked up the phone initially asked me what the problem was and said ""ahem...let em transfer you to the auto dept"". The auto dept had a pre-recorded message that said ""All agents are missing. Pls accept to wait at least *30* minutes"" - which is ridiculous. My call was never picked up and I eventually gave up. Needless to say - I'll never buy Garmin again.Other problems (minor)2) Bulky Design: This is a older generation of GPS. Look for other families (i.e. not c500 series) if you would like a sleek/lightweight device.3)Slow Startup: Often takes > 1 minute. During cloudy days - can take longer."
4,Almost perfect,I have been using my Garmin C580 for a week now and I am very pleased with it's features. I have been very impressed by how easy it is to use.The only change I would suggest to Garmin would be the ability to program multiple stops along a route. Add that feature and my rating would be 5 stars.
3,"Garmin is great, MSN service worthless","The Garmin Streetpilot works great as a navigator. The MSN service works in Baltimore, but almost no-where else. I recently traveled to South Carolina. The only place I could get an MSN signal was for about 15 minutes in downtown Charlotte NC. The other 8+ hours on the trip, no signal, no traffic gas prices etc. I like the Bluetooth, but my wife says it sounds lousy on the other end. I would opt for a lower priced Garmin, with some other traffic service."
2,Don't buy for the MSN service,"GPS functions on this unit work great, similar to other Garmin products. Don't buy this unit if you're getting it for the MSN service. The service is spotty at best and the service and the unit don't appear to work well together. A simple web search will reveal many others with similar complaints of poor or no signal in the middle of coverage areas. Need traffic info consider one of the other Garmin units that use a different traffic service. I called MSN Direct, their customer service is useless, the guy couldn't even find Redmond, WA on a map, you would think Microsoft customer service would know where Microsoft World Headquarters was. Again the Garmin piece is find, beware MSN Direct"
2,Tries to kill me,I bought this Garmin awhile ago for my girlfriend that has to drive a lot for work. The Garmin has literally tried to kill us on several trips. This ranged from going the wrong way down one-way streets to entering the exit ramp onto an expressway. I've updated the firmware but it still continues to act faulty. I wouldn't recommend buying this considering its inaccuracy and bulkiness.
1,MSN DIRECT AWFUL,GARMIN C 580 STREET PILOT-THE MSN SUBSCRIPTION IS AWFUL- DO NOT DO 1 YR FREE TRAIL THAT IT COMES WITH!! IT CONSTANTLY TRIES TO UPDATE SOFTWARE BUT NEVER DOES AND THE MSN UPDATING SCREEN BLOCKS OUT THE WHOLE VIEW OF THE SCREEN SO YOUR LEFT WITH VOICE ONLY!! I LIVE IN WESTERN LONG ISLAND NY WHERE THE COVERAGE AREA SUPPOSED TO BE GREAT- WHAT A JOKE. THE UNIT ITSELF IS OK BUT SHOP AROUND THERE HAS TO BE BETTER..
3,Awsome Garmin,Ordered my first portable navigator from Amazon and I love it and also loved the price when compared to other stores! I love all aspects of the Street Pilot.
1,issues,"I gave this as a gift and have the person I gave it to has had several issues with the MSN direct software. I even paid for additional coverage and it still won't work. The gps portion is fine but I got this unit for the added extras of MSN direct. He's called, I called and they have yet to get it right now they will only honor the warrenty if we had the original box it came in. It's not what I paid for. Caution folks this item has some technical issues!"
2,c550 instead of c580,This is really a c550 instead of a c580 and Garmin dose not care when you tell them about it . I would like to say that Amazon cares about their customers even if Garmin does not they where willing to satisfy me.I also would like to say that the MSN is a real joke if you want people to respect your product give them what they pay for.
2,GOOD ONLY IF YOU HAVE NO CLUE AS TO WHERE YOU ARE GOING,"I'm not impressed.In the city, this device often takes you on side streets instead of main roads, wants you to turn where turns aren't allowed, and takes you down dirt roads with huge potholes!Are there any of these things that know the main roads in cities?"
4,Great product -- recommended,"The C580 is easy to use, full of features navigation system. It is accurate and finds the fastest route to every destination. The addition of the MSN traffic reports allow to avoid the congested roads and select less travel routes (although many times with many stop lights). The verbal directions is very useful when driving. I highly recommend this unit.On the downside, at times (especially after parking in doors), it takes long time to acquire the satellites read (sometimes up to 5 minutes).MSN traffic reports does not get the updates fast enough when traveling away from home, which makes this feature useless when traveling long distances.The build-in MP3 has a flat metallic sound, unless it is connected to the car stereo, ignore this option.The POI database is out of date; for example, on a last trip, many restaurants in the database were out of business. Therefore, call ahead to make sure the establishment is still around."
2,not good,This is a very thick gps. I didn't expect it to be so big and the direction is sometimes confusing. What makes things worse is that the auto charger broke down only after one month's use. I have to contact Garmin to replace it. And that is really annoying.
3,nice but shody reception,"It is easy to function but it took me a week to figure out why i wasn't getting reception. You might have to put it out in the open for about 5 min, away from trees and tall buildings before it gains reception. That's a pain when i want to leave and go somewhere. As well the MSN reception is poor so you may not be able to always get traffic, gas prices, movie times, and weather.I hope to read up more on my GPS when i have more time. Maybe there's trouble shooting for the MSN feature."
4,Garmin StreetPilot c580,Works well and gets you where you need to go; easy to use as well. Have not used the MSN Direct; it comes with a free 30 day trial.
4,"At the Bargain Price, Too Good to Pass Up!","I'll make this review short and to the point. This device works extremely well. I bought it for my girlfriend who recently moved to downtown Philadelphia, and it has yet to give her bogus or misguided directions. If you are in an unfamiliar area, you will thank yourself for buying the item. (I can't speak to its capabilities/accuracy outside of a large metropolitan area, though!) The touch screen is bright and works well. A free year of MSN Direct is icing on the cake.Here are the cons: It doesn't come with an AC adapter (sold separately), so it can only be charged with the included car adapter, which is just annoying. It is a little ""chunkier"" than the other Garmin navigators, so you can't carry it in your pocket. Occassionally, it takes a few extra moments to locate the satellites.All in all, a worthy and recommended purchase."
5,Just what I wanted.,"The men's Casio-AQ517E was just the watch that I wanted: pleasing clock face, illuminated nicely, day/date calendar, alarm, water resistant to 50 M, and thin enough to wear for work and play. Programming is easy although I don't use the chronograph features. The watch is comfortable to wear with knit and tight cuffs, not a feature of many ""sport"" watches that I have owned in the past. Would I recommend this watch to others? Without reservation! And for less than $20, it was a great bargain."
3,Nice classic design,"This is a lovely old design, a near copy of a 70s-era Seiko I wore for years. Unfortunately, this watch is not waterproof, only water resistant. If it were not for that, I would make it my daily companion. The face and window are quite readable, the light solves the problem I remember from that old Seiko, and changing modes is fairly easy, although not like other Casios I have had in recent years."
4,Very Good,"Watch has nice features (light, perpetual calendar, stop watch, analog face, water resistant watch and band, alarm, looks, price, not too big, and accuracy). The only cons are it is about 9 mm thick, the clear plastic scratches, and I am not sure Walmart carries the same band."
2,"Nice design, cheap execution","After a couple of years, this watch showed definite wear - not on the case or crystal so much, rather the buttons got corroded and wouldn't work consistently. I hadn't exposed it to water. The watch is quite attractive, thin and weighs next to nothing. The band breaks easily but is replaced by generic bands easily and cheaply. I've retired it though in favor of other Casio watches. For the short term, it's cheap and expendable/replaceable."
5,Digital/analog sports is a tough combination. This is the best.,"I'm buying my fourth one of these. In my work, I scratch the ""crystal"" a lot. I thought I needed a second hand, but I don't miss it. Buy a band called ""The Band"" from [...], and you'll have the most economical, functional, and comfortable watch of this type you can buy."
1,Can't keep time.,"This watch has all the bells and whistles that I wanted, but loses about 20 minutes a day. I complained to Amazon and asked for return authorization. No reply was received. The watch gets a 1 and Amazon gets a zero."
2,Too much cost cutting,Had one for a Camaro years ago and liked it and wanted to get on for my Mini Cooper. Not pleased at all! Lasted just about three months and fouled up the finish on the car. Not the LeBra of the past!
2,Many detours,Too many detours og not enough murder case. The story is very disorganized with many unnecessary facts that only blurs the theory.
2,Much Ado About Nothing,"This book was hard to follow, there were a lot of characters..speculation, theories of conspiracy...gave my copy to Goodwill.."
3,Pretty good,"...the mixing was kinda shabby. The choice of tracks was excellent though. Air, Dreaming, Tell Me Why and Angelfalls are all unreal tracks.Not too continuous... sometimes just a snare roll and breakbeat into the next trackTheMike"
4,Real life entertainment,"I love this series. Its nice to see a series about African Americans that shows the good, the bad and everything in between. Season one is good but the series definitely got better as it went along. I was sorry to see it go."
4,Please pick this DVD Up,"""Soul Food"" the complete first season is a must have DVD box set for the person who missed a few episodes here and there or for those who want to catch the show from the beginning. My only complaint is the steep steep price,my fear is that many people wont' buy it and the studio won't release future seasons. The show is about three very different sisters leading their lives. It picks up where the movie left off but this show is hot and the show only gets better throughout the season. Malinda Williams, Nicole Ari Parker, and Vanessa Williams star in this series which went on to become the longest running one hour African American drama in history."
2,EDITED,I have a problem with this series being edited. This was the first series that showed black love scenes and they edited them out.....real dissapointed!
5,Definitely food for the soul.,"I'm a 29 year old African American working professional like the character Teri, whom I relate to the most. I purchased the box set last summer and I watched it so much that I had to buy a new set just recently.When I first purchased Season One, I told myself that I would watch one episode per day. I wound up spending the weekend watching the the whole season. Not since the Cosby Show have I seen an African American family on TV that I just fell in love with. The situations are real and relatable. Soul Food: Season One is a must have.I recommend these DVDs to all people of all races. Everyone can relate to the storyline regardless of race.I only pray that they release the other seasons as well. I would be the first in line to purchase them."
1,Poor Quality Plane,I just received a new 9118 and the shoe plates are not flat -- not even close! I am returning it unused. Warped plates make this tool basically worthless. I've noticed a decline in Porter Cable quality and this is either indicative of it or just my bad luck. Porter Cable will not get a second chance on this one. $400 is a lot to pay for a relatively simple tool like this one. It shouldn't be hard to get it right! I make my living with my tools and I don't have time to waste on poor quality.
5,Doors etc,"My wife bought me this machine 25 years ago. I still have the plane, and the wife. It is (the plane) a sweet machine. It is primarily for resizing doors, but I have used it for a jointer of sorts with good success. If you are a door man/person (sorry) its the one for you. I assume it still comes with a carbide blade. If you want to surface plane, you want something else, but for up to about 2.5 inches this is the one.Hope this helps. JA"
2,Big head,"Hat said size 8 but, it had to be at least a 9-10. This hat swam on my head, maybe the manufacturing country of origin was the problem. Definitely not a size 8."
1,Run away if someone ever tries to make you dance to this disc!,"I doubt that there is an orchestra behind this album. It sounds like another synthesizer played with little imagination. I thought maybe the sound samples had been distorted or compressed, that nothing could sound so thin or poor. I was wrong. It is just horrid. Why can't I vote zero stars? Here are the track names, times, and suggested dances.Don't leave me now, 3:55, WaltzI wanna dance/ Te Quiero Mucho, 3:54, TangoSilly Sibyl,3:15, VWaltzLean on me/ Leaky lady, 4:21, FoxtrotTrue blue/ The painter, 4:48, QuickstepWhat's the color of money/ Can't get credit, 3:35, Cha chaWith or without you/ The Bee Flat Bee, 4:05, RumbaDon't get me wrong/ The folding jive, 4:09, JiveFLM/ Clever nutty Clement, 4:49, SambaSlightest touch, The, 3:23, Pasoboble"
1,Don't waste your time,"I couldn't make it through this book and I hate to give up on a book once I start it, but I was barely able to make it to page 60 before I threw in the towel. The book moves very slowly and at times does not make much sense."
2,Cliches,The preview makes the book seem more intriguing than it is. The book is full of cliches. The book makes the reader feel as if only pretty girls have all the luck. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. This book is more for the bubble gum chewer crowd.
2,"(Not) A ""Hang onto the edge of your seat thriller!""","As another reviewer typed, I only read this book to the end to see if it would get any better. I can assure you... it didn't. The story is unrealistic and the characters are underdeveloped. I was very disappointed."
1,Disappointing,"Like some of the other reviewers, I picked this up thinking it would be a clever story about the relationship between two sisters. But really, it turned out to be more of a cheesy murder mystery, with lame attempts at humor. The back of the book is really not a good description of the gist of this story. I struggled through it, but did not enjoy it. Try Christina Bartolomeo's ""Cupid and Diana"" instead for a fun read about sisters."
1,Overrated,"Completely disappointing... Instead of spending time developing the relationship between sisters, Frankel spends much of the novel discussing coffee. The plot line had potential twists (sisterly rivalry, murder, romance), but instead, the novel ended up seeming more like a series of short essays. I had to force myself to finish reading this book, as I felt like I had wasted $$."
1,this book was boring,"I had hi hopes for this book but i was wrong. I want to exchange my SMART VS. PRETTY for something that is INTERESTING. This book was completely boring, i am only up to page 50 or 79 or something & it's a drag. I have been forcing myself to read it. So, since my time is precious, i am giving up on trying to finish this."
1,What a wretched read!,"It's rare that I find a book so awkwardly written and uninteresting that I can't finish it. I gave up at Chapter 12, because the dialogue was fake and the characters were flat.Yuck. Don't waste your time."
1,Not very interesting,I was very disappointed in this book. The book was rather dull and the smart/pretty connection never really surfaced.
1,Dissapointing,"I think any woman with a sister would be attracted to a book that promised an intelligent perspective on the ""smart versus pretty"" issue. I think the author is right when the says that all sisters have their own views on which is which. However, after promising such a satsifying subject, the book wanders off into a poorly written tangle of weird and implausible plot twists and vivid descriptions of what everyone is wearing. If the book had billed itself from the start as a cotton-candy mystery, I might not have been so dissapointed, but as it was I could barely bring myself to finish it."
4,buy this book!,I feel like I know these sisters. Their issues are so universal that if you have a sister--or you know a pair of sisters--you'll get a real caffeine kick out of Frankel's witty exploration of their relationship.
2,"An okay read, but implausible plot","Thought that this was an okay read, but an implausible plot. The sequence of events & sisters' reactions to them seem unrealistic and stilted. I was not impressed."
1,BEYOND BORING!,"While I was expecting nothing more than your basic, pleasant beach read -- entertaining story about two very different sisters -- this boring, poorly written book about one-dimensional women (gee, the ""smart"" one, and, um, the ""pretty"" one) made Cosmo seem refreshing and unique. The title says it all -- one sister is ""smart"" and the other is ""pretty"" -- and that, literally is what gets repeated over and over in this stupid attempt at capitalizing on the popularity of books like Bridget Jones (which this is NOT). There is no irony, no wit, a storyline that a 5-year-old girl could have invented, and the writing is laughable (unintentionally).Despite the spate of negative reader reviews, this book seems to be getting a lot of undeserved hype. Good thing the author has a publicist working so hard, or no one would ever have bothered to read this book. Pay attention to the actual READERS and not the hype: this is just plain awful."
3,.......soooooooooo disappointing..................,"....at first i was excited to read this book because of the plot at the back of the book..i tought it was very good to read especially who has a sister but when i read it i was very disappointing, and the story is so borring i could'nt understand what the story is all about. But i decided to finish it because im also concern to the writers effort to write such story like that...and the tittle smart vs pretty doesn't fit to the story..."
2,Dumb,"I enjoy a wide range of books, and rarely do I have to just stop reading one because it is so bad, but unfortunately, I had to stop reading this one. I made it 1/2 way through before throwing in the towel. The characters were so superficial and BORING and things just don't go anywhere good in this book. NOT a page turner."
2,Nothing remarkable,"Like some others out there, I bought this book because it seemed to fit in the Bridget Jones/single 20-something genre. Although most of these books have similar plots and characters, this one seemed tedious. The story is unbelievable, the characters uninteresting, and I wasn't left with any impression or feeling after reading this."
1,Highly Disappointing!,"This is simply a genre mystery wrapped in a modern-girl-fiction cover. One dimensional characters and a flat plot line will surely disappoint even those who enjoy ""fiction with murder"". My suggestion- Don't bother!"
1,"Awful, truly awful","I suggested this book for my book club based on the strength ofthe reviews on Amazon.com. You can just imagine my embarrassment whenevery single one of us hated it. Who is Ms. Frankel related to in the publishing world? ...I can't believe how truly appalling this book was. In fairness, it would probably be a good read for someone in high school, but it is not being marketed as such. The plot line was ridiculous... We are now in the year 2000 and I find it hard to believe that women are to be classed as either smart or pretty. I did not detect any traces of humor in the book that would show that the author was poking fun at the notion of smart vs. pretty. The characters did not undergo any development by story's end. And, of course there's the rich knight in shining armor at the end, just in time to save the day. I can not find one thing about this book to recommend it."
2,Rather weak,"This was not the book I'd hoped it would be. I was looking for another entry in the ""single woman's fiction"" genre. You know the type: Bridget Jones, Sex and the City, etc., etc.... Instead I found a rather thinly plotted, weak book where descriptions of clothing stand in for characterization. I am a relatively generous reader, usually giving a book the benefit of the doubt, but this one lost me. For the first time since junior high I quit reading before the end of the book. Maybe something great happened later and I just missed it, but I doubt it."
2,Dillusional...,"This book starts out wonderfully. Unfortunately, it turned bad quickly. I kept reading in hopes it would improve. The characters in the book are very believable, but the things that happen to them are just silly especially where love is concerned. The author just took a wrong turn, had the characters' lives been more realistic, I would have loved the book."
2,Farfetched and preposterous,"This book starts out innocently enough, seeming to be about two sisters (one smart, one pretty, just like the title says!) and I figured it would pretty much be about what the title suggested. However, it sooned turned to a ridiculous suspense/thriller with some of the most ridiculously contrived scenes I've read in quite a while. Furthermore, it really didn't even seem to know what it wanted to be about. I was hoping this was Ms. Frankel's first book but apparently it is her third or fourth. If you're looking for someone who knows how to mix contemporary fiction and suspense, try Susan Isaacs."
1,Not Up to Par,"Compared to other Willa Cather adaptations to film ""The Song of the Lark"" was a real disappointment. The film was apparently done on a shoe string budget. There were no actual views of Chicago, nor were there any views of the cliffs in Arizona.The dubbing of Thea's voice was sloppy, and the movie just fizzled at the end. We never get a chance to see Thea perform in big time opera.The acting was only average; the actor playing Dr. Archie (Cowboy in ""Full Metal Jacket"") was embarrassing.Other Cather adaptations, such as ""O Pioneers"" and ""My Antonia"" have been done so well, but this film is a waste of money. Avoid it and buy the others.Oh yeah, read the novel. It is captivating."
4,"Exacting, Tedious, Charming and Delightful!","This little book, written nearly 100 years ago, is still just what the doctor ordered to help both beginning and professional gardeners grow better herbs. The slightly stilted, old-fashioned language is a very comfortable match to the subject matter. Be prepared to discover the histories of herbs, how to cultivate and harvest them, how to use them to add flavor to soups, stews, salads, and meats. The author's perspective is surprisingly modern, being very accepting of historical uses (and misuses) of herbs, but also allowing for the world's present wisdom to change, for new and improved uses and applications for herbs. Great care and affection is shown throughout this book for the disappearing art of herb gardening. In the author's own words, ""It is not to late to learn the good old ways all over again."""
2,Old fashioned,More for the gardener of heritage seeds and cultivation; not for kitchen gardener or recipes of culinary herbs and uses.
3,Herbs,This book is quite interesting and contains good information on using and drying herbs as well as growing them. Excellant reference for the novice.
1,Dissapointed,"The contents can be found on the internet with minimul search. No colored pictures. Each herb is discussed in about 2 paragraphs. This is not what i was anticipating. I have other books that have more detail with colored photos. Tending and harvesting, revive a withered plant are things i was hoping for."
2,Looks Better On A Web Page,"Received the item in a reasonable time frame, however, the coasters are much more 'rugged' in appearance than when viewed online. The holder will definately scratch a wooden surface as well, so keep that in mind before buying."
5,Great!,Amazing dvd set it comes with alot of fun extras and the episodes are so entertaining and so much fun to watch youll definitely watch the dvds more than once over.Over Completely Satisfied.
3,Price was right,"Price was right, the only problem I have had was that one of the drives broke from the handle and slid up inside it. The handles are hollow plastic and the driver is either molded or glued to the inside. Still works tho."
4,Good Tools,The tools are used to perform computer maintenance on MacBook Pros. They work quite well.
5,will work on 3.5 inch hard disk drives,"I would like to point out that this set contains a screwdriver that matches up perfectly with the torx screws holding together my (run of the mill, plane Jane, commodity Seagate, Hitachi, Western Digital) 3.5-inch form-factored hard disk drives ([...]).This was the primary reason for my purchasing this set, so just in case anyone else has the same use case, be assured that they fit."
5,LOOKIN GOOD SO FAR,"Being what they are ,SPARK PLUGS, either they work or they will not. I have not installed them as of yet. I am assured that AUTOLITE has a very good reputation and will do their job as stated. If problems are encountered you can rest assured I will edit this review to reflect the problem.ADD 9/30/2012Plugs work excellent.In fact I have purchased additional units for my other vehicles requiring this model of sparkplug."
3,I don't think I ever read the original book as a child,"I was familiar with the character, of course, but I don't recall ever reading the first book.And now I think I see why. It is a little stuck in the past, isn't it? We don't glorify poaching anymore, nor smoking, nor old-fashioned zoos. (And that just messes with the series canon, that, since George doesn't live in the zoo in any of the other books.)Moreover, my nieces don't find this book interesting, but they do find more recent Curious George stories interesting.Please read this before you buy to make sure it's right for your kids."
1,A bit much for my 3 year old,"George was taken from his home and put into a bag.George was put into a prison.These things can be scary to a young mind.George enjoyed a pipe (smoke and all) after dinner.Nothing needed to be said about that.Not trying to be over-politically-correct, but this was a bit much for my 3 year old and she even asked if I could take it back to the store.Obviously others have same age children who like it. This is just another opinion for others to consider.At the same time, she loved ""Caps For Sale"" which we got at the same time. And she loves the more recent Curious George stories that don't deal with kidnapping, imprisonment, and tobaco usage."
1,Terrible!,Terrible book! My 3yo started asking right off the bat why did the man took George away from his home?Terrible taste.
2,It is no longer for today's kids,"I got this for my son and it had been so long since I read any of those books I forgot how I hated the original story. Fist George is kidnapped and then he is arrested and then for the ""happy ending"" he is put in a zoo!! THEN I remembered why I was not more a fan of Curious George as a kid. I like my son's books to be fun and full of imagination not trauma and woe. Needless to say my son also hates that book, but loves the other books in that series and loves all of the newer and updated to today's standards and the new movie and PBS show. I know it is a classic, but to me a classic is still great many years down the road, so to me it is not a true classic."
1,Made me physically ill to read this book.,"How anyone could like this book is really beyond me. This book should stay a relic of the past. My 4 year old picked this book out at the library and I read it to her. I really didn't remember the story. I was sick. Little George is kidnapped just because some man took a fancy to him, put in a bag and tied up and taken half way around the world to be imprisoned in a zoo?! How horrible. How can you explain to a little child about being tied up in a sack, first of all? Also, he goes to JAIL for making mistake by summoning the fire dept in error? This is also terrifying. Oh yes, he smokes too, but that seems to be the least of all of the horrors. Just because it's old doesn't mean its good."
4,A Children's Classic,"We have the full collection in one big book, but I decided to get this on my android tablet for when I'm on the go with my kids. Overall this was well done for a digital copy. All the images and text were clean and clear. I have some issues with the Kindle app on Android, but the book is just fine in this format.Well Done."
4,Just as advertised,"Bought the book used and it was in good shape just as advertised. You never know what good shape is especially for a children's book, but despite a few minor creases it was in good condition, besides I have a feeling my daughter is going to add a few more creases anyway."
4,Orlando Pops play well...except the Star Wars Tracks,"This was originally released in the U.K. under the title ""The Magic of John Williams"" a 78 minute long CD. That title was also released here but only 45 minutes long. This album is the rest of that plus a couple other songs. The non Star Wars tracks are superb, I don't know what it is, but the Orlando Pops orchestration fo the star wars tracks are not very good."
5,Where to Find the Lindsay Schubert Recordings...,"The Lindsay Quartet is my favorite string quartet on disc. I adore their buoyant, characterful Haydn recordings, and so when I went looking for a Schubert set, I was disappointed to see that the now defunct ASV no longer offers much to US customers. Fortunately, the Earth being now flat, we yanks can solve this problem by going to amazon.co.uk. In the UK, they offer an incredible collection of Schubert's late quartets (D112, D804, D810, D887, D956, and the single movement of the posthumous D703) for less than $20. It's an incredible bargain for some wonderful recordings."
3,"Get This Product in Olive Oil, Not Water",The Starkist Gourmet Choice tuna in olive oil is one of the best on the market and compares very favorably with the imported Italian stuff which costs much more. The water pack is just so-so. The olive oil intensifies the good flavor of this tuna; the water just leaches it out. The olive oil version was very favorably rated in a blind tasting by Lynn Rosetta Casper on the Splendid Table show on NPR. When was the last time your guests praised your tuna salad? Mine always do!
5,Just stupid funny!,This is just plain funny. Great for people with a good sense of humor! Great movie for the price and quality of dvd is perfect.
4,Early and rare philosophical analysis of dance,"""Philosophers will find this . . . book, despite its flaws, a welcome and very rare application of philosophical methods of analysis to writings about dance. Hopefully, dance theorists will recognize the book as considerably more than smug plundering of their best efforts."" -- from my review for Dance Research Journal, Vol. 13 (Spring 1981), pp. 34-35"
4,Poor Antrim County,"an excellent book in general, but a very short on native Irish Antrim county names; sometimes confusing them with Hebridean Scottish ones. And God help you if you have an obscure Irish name.. it will not be there."
2,Lots of names - Little information,"There are a lot of names here, but very little information - only one sentence on my family, which I already knew. I expected more information or at least a source to go to for more background. OK for generic research only for rare names."
1,I would like to give a no star rating,"It doesn't give ""cures"" as it claims. It is old and outdated information (reprint of English (as in England) book from 1959)and if followed by a novice could result in serious injury in some cases when referring to the various stall vices horses develop. It does not deal with the real reason these horses develop issues, but tries to effect a cure that is not feasible. This book was thankfully inexpensive, and really does not offer the reader with any useful advice. Its only saving grace is that it was interesting to note what methods are now considered archaic and which have been around forever!"
5,Sunbeam Tea Spot,"I was made aware of this product by a family member and soon became a tea drinker. I searched stores locally and finally went to Amazon and got one much sooner than I expected. I love it and it works great. I use it every morning instead of making my usual coffee. I prefer to use tea bags, but it works quite well loose or bagged tea providing a good rich, not bitter flavor."
5,Great tea maker,This is a wonderful tea maker. My first one broke after 2 years so I bought another one as I love my morning pot of tea.
3,Not for Serious Tea Drinkers,"IF you are merely throwing in a bit of lipton in a bag, this will work fine. If you take the time to buy quality loose tea; buy something else. Even with de-calcifying the unit every 45 days, this pot broke down in less than a year--well worth the 30 bucks we paid, but now we will go to something better. We also use cast iron kettles and ifuse our own, but for morning tea, we like something automatic. We are going to spend more for a Zarafina."
2,"Heats water, but awkward to use and not very good for tea","Pros: it looks cute and it heats up the water. No electricity/wiring problems after 6 months of use. Useful for lipton-style black bagged tea.Cons: Really difficult to get water into the device without spilling all over the counter (if you buy one, you will see what I mean). Does not work well with green teas that need to be seeped at just-under boiling temperature. Not good with loose teas at all. No auto-off feature. Loud when boiling the water. Does not stop pouring tea if you take the glass kettle off for a minute to pour yourself a cup (it just keeps pouring onto the hot plate).Eventually, I ended up replacing it with a Braun WK200W Electric Water Kettle and I am much happier. The Braun is more expensive than this, but it's well worth it if you drink at least one hot beverage per day. Not to mention the Braun is faster and much more user friendly."
4,Pony-4-Sale,I thought this book was great. I really liked thedrawings because they helped tell the story.
1,Angry Liberals against Arnold,You have to wonder what the liberals behind this are so angry about. Arnold turned into a liberal in California. This documentary is what you expect from Republican haters. Some of the source material for this is awful and looks as though it was captured from youtube. Coudln't they go to the source tapes? It's a low budget piece of trash.
3,Good...but not worth the price,"This album is a good sampler of the double album ""Purity of Essence"" (which is full of filler), but not worth the price. If you are interested in checking out what the Bathory main-man was up to, I guess this could be a good starting point, but I would think ""Album"" would be a much better choice."
5,Incredible Product,"This is an amazing product. You will think it is magic the way it removes scratches from plexiglass. The windshield on my golf cart was very scratched up and I thought I had to replace it. I rubbed on the Novus polish and let it dry. When I removed it, I was shocked. The scratches were gone and I no longer have any problem with it. This product is fantastic."
3,Disappointing,"Perhaps I have read too many Wodehouses recently but I found this a little disappointing. This is a very late one in Wodehouse's career and I really felt as if the magic had almost disappeared - the effortless humour and timeless atmosphere was no longer there and it was if this was just another one he was churning out. The usual features are here: a possible theft, in this case of the girl in blue, a Gainsborough minature, engagements and broken engagements and, of course, a country house (with fake butler). Anyway whilst the story was entertaining I finished with a sense of deflation and with a sense of loss that comic greatness had departed, so to speak."
2,"Broke fairly quickly, not very useful","This toy and I never quite got a long. The games seemed to be either very simple or too hard. They weren't good at ramping your skills. I didn't play on it hard or too often and after a few months it had problems with the power cord. We solved this for a while with tape but then that stopped working too.There's a large variety of sounds but many of them you don't want to listen too.Anyway I've switched to hitting pans, cups, and pieces of wood. It sounds better."
2,Overkill,"I initially thought this book would be an engaging and spiritual description of the Camino experience. Rupp's complaints and negativity quickly took their toll on this reader and left me disenchanted with her whole experience. However, every pilgrim finds individual purpose in his or her own journey and I respectively leave that manifestation without ridicule if this is what moved her spiritually."
4,Walk in a Relaxed Manner.,"I didn't finish this book, i think it is a good experience but it is an little difficult to be their shoes."
4,Good read before Camino hike,"This was a realistic accounting of what walking the Camino De Santiago trail is al about - foot blisters, scheduling issues, and all. I think it was a little dissuading, and could have emphasized more of the pleasant aspects of the walk."
2,"written in a relaxed manner, read if you have nothing better to do","I chose this because the author is my same age and I'm preparing to walk the Camino. It does have helpful info, especially about her training program, but Cheri Powell's book is MUCH better for basic info in general and spares you the new agey droning on and on. Hape Kerkeling's book is a good read too. Pass on this one."
5,I enjoyed this thoughtful book.,"Reflections of this Catholic sister, as she walks the Camino with the semi retired priest of her parish.This journey of two people of faith met with all the challenges the Camino can offer. Joyce started out as what I call an overachiever, and Tom as a steadying influence.A couple concepts stuck in my brain from chapters of this book. Enjoy existential friendships. Return a positive for a negative. Negative things do happen, but Joyce would make a determined effort to see the positive - a concept I accept, but sometimes have difficulty applying.I enjoyed this thoughtful book."
1,"Oh boy, watch out for this one....","This book is a very disheartening account of one person's experience walking the Camino. If you would like to be discouraged from going, then this is the book for you. The author shines an unforgiving spotlight on anything and everything that is negative. She places herself in the position of judge and finds herself to be cleaner and smarter than the giving and kind people who run and operate the refugios, restaurants and shops along the way. The spiritual lessons she gleans are uninspiring in contrast to the glee she appears to get from dissing just about everyone and everything. Why didn't she stay home? She never finds a satisfying answer to that question. If you are called to walk the Camino and are excited and happy about what awaits you, skip this account. Your experience can only be better than this one. Blessings to Ms. Rupp."
5,Keep your lights on the road,"My son, who is now 6, got this book right after he turned 2. In these 4 years we have read the book hundreds of times. It has never lost its appeal nor has he outgrown it. The story is complex (to an adult), it has love, drama, adventure, a strong work ethic and a happy ending.I have always wanted to write to the author and the illustrator to tell them how timeless and wonderful the story and the illustrations are but more importantly, if only to myself, I wanted to let them know that for 4 years now my son has only called me Big Truck. That's become my name, my whole family calls me Big Truck, my son's friends call me Big Truck. The last time I heard the word ""Mama"" come from my son's lips was a week after he got the book. I told my husband I want ""Big Truck"" on my tombstone. To say the book has been influential in our home is an understatement - and we love it."
4,A good book for the just-diagnosed,"This is a good fibromyalgia book to buy if you have just been diagnosed and you are looking for practical advice on how to cope with your illness. Though not as detailed and complete as Starlanyl and Copeland's Fibromyalgia and Chronic Myofascial Pain Syndrome, it is also less overwhelming and so is particularly good for someone who is feeling overwhelmed, doesn't like a lot of medical information, or has a mild form of the disease. The chapters ""You aren't alone"", ""Making Lifestyle adjustments,"" and ""Practical helps for specific problems"" are quite good, as are the three chapters on managing fatigue, stress, and flareups."
5,Very helpful,"I have read numerous books on the subject including one written by a prominent Dr in my area but not one has been written with a better understanding of what a fibromyalgia patient goes through. It is written with clarity and forethought and is a must read for those suffering with the disease and those around them, it gives those who surround the patient a much clearer understanding of what life is like for them. There may be more books with more medical largess but this one is a practical guide with a true knowledge of the ups and downs of fibro. I have a copy and have gifted it often to those who have questions or have been diagnosed."
5,"It's a ""gotta"" read","This book tells it all for anyone suffering from fibromyalgia or for someone who has a family member or friend with it. It's easy reading and even tells you how to deal with the image the rest of the world and even bosses and co-workers have of the condition because it is so different for each person dealing with it. There's alot of misunderstanding and unbelief out there but with this book I was able to purchase from Amazon.com it helped me to change people's views on the subject if even just to recognize that maybe it might NOT be ""just in your head"". I highly recommend it also for the legal help it includes and I've guided may folks to seek help, get questions answered, or at least recognize that fibromyalgia is real."
5,A great book for experienced developer,"Background info:I have about 2 years working experience in developing application using embedded SQL to get data from DB2 for AIX. This experience has helped me a lot to understand the contents of this book and it helps to pass the application development test. I spent about 4 weeks to read this book and tried the sample test at the end of the book.My tip: after reading the whole book, try the sample test and rate your score, but don't check for the wrong/right answer you have choosen. Try to figure out by yourself, which topic you think that you have problem to answer and re-read the book.Using this technique I got about 75% of the sample test on a second try. After that I took the real exam, and passed with the score of 72%.If you have some experience (at least 6 months IMO) on developing application that gets data from DB2 (either with embedded SQL or JDBC/ODBC), then you shouldn't have any problem to pass the test by using only this book as a study guide."
2,Better than Nothing,"Unfortunately, this seems to be the only book available to specifically prepare for this exam. While the material is probably covered, the examples and practice test (which is identical to the online practice test at ICE) in this book are so much easier than the actual exam, that I felt I was ready for the real exam when I got scores over 90 on the practice exam, but flunked the real one. Sybex knows how to do certification books right, but they don't have any for DB2."
4,chapters from 6.1 DB2 book on app development - nicely updat,"This is a ""sister"" book of ""DB2 Universal Database Version 7.1 for UNIX, Linux, Windows and OS/2 Database, ISBN 0130913669"". See my review on this book - I talk there about both of them, also about certification tests."
3,"Bonnie Tyler CD ""The very best of B T """,I like Bonnie Tyler and thought is Cd Album is great for my collection.It's some older songs of this Artist.I prefer more of her 80's and 90's music.~Jane
5,Imagine Jesus,"Imagine Jesus is a wonderful journey into imaginative prayer through the use of the Scriptures. Anderson uses brief pericopies to open each chapter and then explodes the text into some wonderfully new and fresh visions of Jesus, his world and his life.Anderson's insights are fresh and engage the reader experientially not only by looking at Jesus and his life through a new lense but by breaking open the concept of Jesus' human heart.This book is written simply and beautifully. The chapters are short but spiritually packed. Each chapter is a window into the heart of Jesus by interweaving the sacred Scripture with new questions that break open the humanity of a compassionate Jesus who continues ""to grow in wisdom and grace.""I hightly recommend this book for anyone who is looking to understand who Jesus was or anyone who would like to expand his/her relationship with Jesus. It is an excellent spiritual companion or preaching resource for new insights. I hope you enjoy it as much as I have."
4,"Nice item, but some hassle","The item is very nice and I agree with the prior reviewer that it is not an image of a muse, but one of Hercules. Once ordered the seller called and said that it was unavailable and offered a larger replacement at the same cost. A decent thing to do, but we were not interested in the replacement. We asked for a refund, but before that happened, the coin necklace became available and was delivered. Surprise! In any case it was worth the money and I would buy it again."
3,Good but could be better,"i like this necklace, it looks really nice, but isn't what the name say, i think its Hercules like everybody think"
2,Unhappy,"I ordered a Calliope Muse necklace and got a tiny MAN. Most likely Hercules. Well, yes, we all love Herc, but I wanted Calliope. I should have looked more closely at the picture and the reviews. It's far more hassle to return it and hunt down a new one than it is to just keep it and pass it along as a gift. If it were labeled correctly? GREAT gift. But useless to me now, other than a gift."
1,Bad Filter,After my oil change I saw that the color of old oil was very dark.It seems that the filter did not do its job well.Waste of money.
1,100 Greatest Discoveries - genetice and Biology,$29.99 DVD never arrived. Unable to make contact with seller after many attempts. Definitely NOT pleased with seller.
3,Something Different Inside,"...The pressure supplied is more than sufficient for average duty use. The recovery time is not to bad. The price is reasonable. However with those positives let me get to the other side.First, ..., the guages are exposed in a poor design and can be a serious potential liability. It can easily be broken off. The consumer needs to make special note of this.... Although most of these models are on the display floor, having four legs, I found that a good deal of them only have three legs. This makes it hard to stay upright any of the time. It rolled around the back of my van at every stop, go, turn, you name it. I even tried surrounding it with other items to box it in. It is so top heavy, it falls on its side anyway. A slight tug on your air hose is enough to send it rolling.The four legged version is satisfactory but, watch out for that three legged version its a nightmare. I exchanged it for the roll cage model. I'll tell you about that one on that review.I AM OUT....."
2,Deeply frustrating movie,"This should have been a great movie. It has good, even very good actors with at least an A- storyline. It creates what could have been complex and dynamic relationships between our lead characters. And then it limps from start to finish. Some nice moments between our lovers, and that's about it. Except for the romantic leads the rest of the relationships in the film don't develop much depth or feeling, and the ending is thin and disappointing. Wanted to like this film. Gave it away once I was done."
3,OK to watch once,"My boyfriend and I stumbeled onto this film and decided to give it a try. While we really enjoyed it we found it a tad dry and underdeveloped. But as far a gay cinama goes it was classy and clean, compared to some of the racy trash that REALLY sends the wrong message. It's theme of love as an emotion not as a physical act is very endearing. Id recamend it as a rental not as a purchase."
4,Holding Trevor,A second coming of age with a twist. Good emotional content and a sub-plot regarding the need for HIV testing for all sexually active people. And who can resist Trevor becoming authentic before becoming a partner?
4,Good Way to Spend the Evening,Holding Trevor is a good way to spend a couple of hours. It provides both drama and comedy and the interactions between the characters are excellent. Good acting and production values make this film a good choice for an evening of entertainment.
1,Shallow and Superficial,"My opinion is about the movie, not the actors.There is no depth or breath of character, dynamics between the characters and no connection to the viewer. No art, no soul. Empty. Vacuous. The only quality present is the mechanics of the actual photography."
1,Critical Review,"I gave this one star because at least Jay Brannan was bearable. The rest of the actors were terrible. This could have been a great story if well told and acted, but unfortunately it was poorly scripted and horribly acted. Half way in I couldn't give a toss for any of the characters. They all came across as whiny, self-absorbed and devoid of any positive qualities. There was no chemistry to be had between any of the actors and I had to force myself to follow this disaster to it's unbelievable and totally predictable, boring end."
4,Excellent Debut Novel,"I truly enjoyed this novel. It has just enough drama but not too much. Ty,Terry and Jeff were cousins that work together running a club. All three are going through relationship drama like you wouldn't believe, they try to be there for each other through it all. This book will show true to life family,friendships and relationships."
2,This is really a journal,"I did not know it was a journal, where I would be the one writing on the pages. If I had known this I would not have made the purchase. I am very sorry."
1,adhesive my butt!,"Probably perfectly good sandpaper, but since they don't stick to the pad (and I even got a 3m pad to go with them) there's no way to be sure. A real disappointment and major aggravation. Last about 30 seconds before they start to shift on the pad and within a minute, they've flung themselves across the workshop. Useless and returned."
1,Would not recommend this player.,"I purchased this DVD player a year ago. And the sound quality blew up. The sound now plays very low. I have to crank the stereo output or the TV volume in order to hear the DVD. I, too, am faced with purchasing a new DVD player. Not a satisfied customer."
1,Worked 1 time than kaput,"I purchased this Dvd player and 2 other (so called no name) brands as gifts for family members. It`s funny (not really) that the so called name brand was the one that [broke] on me. I watched Star Wars Attack of the Clone and thought what a wonderful DVD player. Problem is, after trying to play another Dvd, I kept getting ""can`t read DVD"". Did`nt matter what I did or what DVD I put in. I guess this is what they would call a disposable DVD player. Your just allowed to watch it 1 time.... Needless to say I will not be buying Toshiba anymore."
2,Rather dissapointing,"Ours came with the TV but it looks like we're going to have to buy a better player pretty soon. My gripes are that the playing of CDs is poor as the player quite often misses the first fraction of some of the tracks. I've yet to get it to play SVCD disks that play fine on other dvd players, so that's the home movies unplayable. The manual is poor, so I don't know whether it's supposed to support the format or not, though it does claim CD digital video. I've yet to find a way to unlock the region too."
2,"Worked for a year, then KAPUT!","When I bought an earlier version of this product (the SD-1700) last year, I was more than satisfied with it. I think I used the player about two dozen times in 12 months I have owned it and never had a problem. However, when I sat down to view a brand-new disc the other day, the movie played for about two minutes, then the tv emitted a sqawk, and now I no longer have any volume from ANY disc that I attempt to play and the scrolling menu on the front of the machine no longer works. And, you got it, the warranty has expired.Needless to say, I guess you get what you pay for. I think I'll take a pass on any other Toshiba products from now on!"
1,Very Disappointed,"I purchased this DVD player based on the strength of the Toshiba name over several cheaper ""generic"" models that offered similar features. Although installation was simple and relatively painless, I discovered a very disappointing flaw in the machine in its first use. During fast-paced action sequences, the picture will flicker and disappear for several frames. Although this flaw is minor in some DVDs, it becomes especially troublesome in action movies and fast-paced scenes. I have sent the unit in for warranty repair, and I am awaiting its return. I highly recommend that anyone interested in a mid-priced DVD player stay away from this machine and Toshiba products in general."
1,Poor Reliability,"I purchased the earlier version in this series from Amazon about a year ago, and just recently, with less than 100 play-hours, it became erratic and died. Based on Amazon-listed reviews of this and other Toshiba products and my personal experiences, Toshiba's product and service quality seems to have gone way down in recent years. I cannot recommend this DVD player or the manufacturer."
4,great unit for the price,Toshiba make great products!! There tv's last longer and are better than most leading brand names so i trusted there name and bought the SD1800 DVD player and once again i'm impressed. These guys were the first to make a dvd player and everyone else jumped on the band wagon. I like this product so much i bought one for a friend in NY for Christmas. This model is the perfect dvd player for simple viewing of dvd's or just listening to music. It doesn't have fancy features but it's perfect for the price range. Why pay [big] bucks for a cheap no name when for [a little] more you can buy a brand name product that will out last all brands.
4,Great product (so far) for a great price,"I was originally looking at the SD2800, but then noticed that the 1800 has the same features for less money. The picture quality is top notch on my ""regular"" TV. I don't plan to by HD anytime soon so I did not go for the progressive scan. The MP3 playback is good as long as your recordings are of high quality but there are a few restrictions -- names can only be 8 charaters (DOS format) with the .mp3 extension and it can only handle 254 songs (I think that's the number) per disc even though you can usually put more songs than that on a CD. The remote is very easy to use the only drawback being that it has no controls for your TV (volume) like others I've seen. Overall a great budget player!"
4,"Another Season,Another Great Album!","This album contains the themes from UFO Princess Valkyrie season two. The tracks were enjoyable, although most were more dramatic and subdued compared to the first season. One of the most noteworthy tracks was 'December Princess',which had a beautiful but melancholic melody. The only downside to this album was that it didn't contain the opening theme, otherwise this is a must buy for fans of the series."
3,Moving little book!,"I really liked this book - I have to be honest and admit up-front that it is a very personal book for me - the main character is my father - but family loyalty aside, I think Nick Taylor did a very good job of focusing on the issues and describing every day life in the parish. It's readable without being preachy, and it has some very funny moments, as well as some very moving moments. If you can find a copy of it, please do read it and enjoy!"
1,Not so good.,"Nicolette is best known for her work with Portishead, a band I generally like. She alone is credited for a mesmerizing track of of the Mission Impossible soundtrack (not in the movie), however. I figured: (member of) a good band, one great song, why not give her a try. Now picture a Portishead album robbed of all of its drama, color and interest, aimlessly ambling about and you pretty much have Life Loves Us.I don't know, if you are somehow a big Nicolette fan, this might just spin your propeller. If you are buying this because of Portishead, don't."
3,many typos,I found many typos and errors in the things I am familiar with and now wonder about the things I'm not.
4,clean design,goes with my black and white bathroom. very complimentary. bot the matching over the med cabt lites too
1,So clueless,"It's very frustrating reading someone so obviously intelligent be so willfully blind. She seems to believe that large drug companies offer nothing because universities (and startups, someone she undersells) invent so many of the base drugs, without acknowledging that those groups would not be able to do the research they do without a route to commercialization. Almost none of them have the resources to turn a feeder drug into a commercial one, and the risks are so high they'd sink themselves. Selling to pharma companies is a way of significantly reducing the risks and costs of their research, which lets them proceed with it in the first place. She also misses all sorts of important points about survivorship bias among the drugs pharma companies sell and all that to make the pharma industry out to be way, way more profitable than it actually is.She seems to be more concerned with her political point than actual economics. I don't recommend this book."
4,Govt support for research must increase if greater investment is to succeed,"Several excellent reviews have already been submitted. Permit me to add a comment.Dr. Angell makes clear that most innovative drugs originate from academic or government research, but a related point was overlooked. Many companies announced plans to expand pharmaceutical businesses in the `90s. But the govt did not increase support for academic research. Expanded research efforts can require years to adequately staff and equip. Hence, the pool of good ideas for new drug development requires time to expand. More resources in drug research is not likely to pay off without increased support for academic and government research."
1,Bite the hand that fed you,Where was Angell when she was employed by a journal that was supported by Pharma advertising? What a hypocrit.
2,Drug companies are people too,"Hey, the people who work in big pharma are not evil money suckingvampires. In fact we feel very fortunate to be in jobs where we get to help people.I don't think anyone would willing put out drugs they know are going to harm people and if they do they should be tried and jailed if guilty.Americans live for a long time, people from other countries come to our hospitals and our doctors to get treatment and medicine. We ship AIDS drugs and money to Africa and other third world countries. Yet the press wants to vilify the drug industry because it wants to make as much profit as possible?!? Last time I checked we lived in a Republic founded on the ideas of democracy and capitalism with a subtle mix of FDR socialism b/c as Americans we help our neighbors. But also sometimes as Americans we make our neighbors pay for the help."
1,Or no stars,Both pharma and doctors are responsible for cost effective care of patients and both should be held to that responsibility.
3,"More facts, less exaggeration","Dr. Angell's book could have been great, but can only be described as adequate becase she skews the facts in much the same way that the Pharma companies, which she is critical of, do.For example, Dr. Angell makes it sound like the Pharma companies have been stealing valuable research from accademia. She barely mentions that the Pharma companies have been paying heaps of royalties to the academics and institutions that invented the drugs.Furthermore, on numerous occassions she blugeons Schering Plough over Claritin/Clarinex, but never clearly articulates that Schering's strategy has been a total failure.We absolutely need a solution to the problems ailing the American health care system, however, this solution will not come from semi-polemical books such as Dr. Angell's."
1,I struggled to get through it - More of a Rant Than Informative Text,"In fair disclosure, I have been employed in the drug industry for over a decade.I like to think I am impartial, if not overly critical of the drug industry and some of its morally reprehensible actions (and failures to act).That being said, I did not find this text added value to the discussion, nor any meaningful thoughts on how to improve moving foward. It came off to me as a conspiracy theorist's rant, and because of that tone to the writing, the author lost me and any faith I had in any part of the content being reliable."
4,Excellent and timely book with hard-hitting truths,"This is an excellent book that comphrensively addresses the major problems faced by patients and consumers of precription medicine in the USA. The author correctly asserts that there may be yet another watershed for the pharmaceutical industry, only this time it may not be as profitable for big business. The author raises critical issues--although I do not think that ""writing to congress"" will change anything, nor do I think that MD's will answer pointed questions vis-a-vis their involvement in what could be viewed as dangerous practices."
5,Every medical student should read this book.,"Spot on! I have been practising medicine for 15 years and the ways drug companies make their profit are becoming more and more annoying. Fake studies, employed ""experts"", creating new diseases, broadening disease definitions....Thanks to the writer for this excellent book, 2 thumbs up!"
4,"Great information, a little too familiar/sarcastic","My first impression about this book was startling. Since the author was editor in chief of the NEJM, I expected the writing to sound more like an academic than a petulant teenager. The occasional first-person references are even jarring, considering that the last book on this topic was the $800 Million Pill, which I highly recommend. Ms Angell apparently wanted to write an ""accessible"" book, but I found the writing style too familiar. However, I have to recommend this book as well, because the topics covered are more wide-ranging than Mr Goozner's book, and are covered in sufficient depth. The clinical development material concerning AZT, Taxol, etc is there, but also chapters on patent shenanigans, buying the Medicare Prescription Drug passage, phony CME, and so on."
5,an extraordinary little book,"I have known this book for many years, and own it in a couple of languages other than English. It is one of the most beautiful little books I have ever read, and I was very happy to find it in English and pass it on to people who can appreciate a genuinely poetic, yet totally unsentimental, close-clipped story. I was a little disappointed with the translation (as compared to, say, the German edition) but I'm not sure it could be done much better."
5,A valuable scrutiny of the Blaue Reiter art movement,"Originally published in Munich in 1912, and now available in English, The Blaue Reiter Almanac is a valuable scrutiny of the Blaue Reiter (Blue Rider) art movement, which was founded in 1911 by painters Wassily Kandinsky and Franz Marc and remained active in Europe until 1914. The Blaue Reiter Almanac combines an assembly of short essays with black-and-white reproductions of artwork to offer the reader a glimpse into the methodology, purpose, and essence of this short-lived yet passionate movement. An invaluable addition to modern art history shelves."
4,Going further,"Having read some of Kandisky's work which has really helped me to go further, this book was exceptional and really worth it."
1,pump bearings leaking after one year of light duty use,"after one year of light duty use pump bearing leaking oil and fly wheel belt won't ride true . unit now in shop waiting for parts, down time three to four weeks, had to borrow small compressor from family member. I would not recomend this compressor at all. A better compressor would be home depots huskey 60 gal a much better built unit at 399.00 pump is solid cast iron and the tubing is copper vs alumium that poter cable uses .I think poter cable should stick to building beltsanders, routers,& sawzalls"
4,"Good pads, good bargain.",These pads are a good bargain and do what they are intended to do. 4 X 4 is still a little small for my liking but they'll do in a pinch.
4,An alternate look at a beloved classic,"An alternate take on the Korean classic 'The Tale of Chunhyang.' Instead of celebrating the love between Yi Mongryong and Chunhyang that transcended class barriers, here Chunhyang is a calculating woman who doesn't hesitate to sacrifice her true love for a chance to marry up. Yi Mongryong is also shown as a vainglorious young man whose devotion to Chunhyang doesn't stem from true love but his sense of superiority and anger at being bested by an inferior man (i.e. Bang-Ja, his servant). Interestingly, Bang-Ja is shown as the most noble, faithful character of them all, in contrast to his original portrait as a sly man whose primary function was to facilitate the budding relationship between his master and Chunhyang. Quite twisted but who knows? Maybe this adaptation is more faithful to how people might have behaved than the idealized portrait in the original classic."
4,The Servant,"I thought this movie had a good storyline, and good acting. The cinematography was also good, as well as the costumes."
2,Be wary,"Although the concept of selling puts instead of buying stock,if and only if ,you have the money to buy the stock in the event of being exercised,is a good well proven strategy,the way it is presented in this book is exagerated and missleading.The amounts the author claims as put premiums are totally unrealistic in any normal market.In fact they would be difficult to achieve in any market.Rarely does the author ever state the time to expiration of the puts he sells which is strange,and suspicious.One can only suspect he is loading the facts to suit his thesis.The ideas presented in this book could probably be reduced to about 5 pages without loosing much.I note some of the other reviews have the appearance of being written by supporters of the author.I suspect he has made more money from selling the book than his method as presented in the book."
2,How to stretch 50 pages of material into a 300 page book,"The author has an interesting thesis for investing solely using a hedged set of Put options. After doing some analysis it does appear that the concept has merit, at least during times of high market volatility. At other times it appears that the premiums do not exceed the trade commisions -- at least with my brokerage.The author must have had a minimum word requirement in his publishing contract because he took an inordinate amount of space to define his reasonably simple concept."
5,Put Options are a powerful tool for your investing toolkit.,"This book does an excellent job at explaining Put Options and why you need to use them. You'll never just buy a stock again, selling the Put Option is ALWAYS a smarter move."
2,BOO! Did that scare you?,"Boo did that scare you? If so then you want this series....if not...keep reading....I only ""purchased"" one episode because it was free & I wanted to check it out before I purchased a whole season. First let me say I am a HUGE fan of ghost stories & own many ghost series shows. But when I watched this it reminded me of sitting around a campfire telling stories that are more silly than scary. This show in my ghost loving opinion....is not worth anything at all. If all of it's episodes were free I just might watch them when I'm bored....but no $ is leaving my pocket for this!"
2,Good Stories but poor acting,"The story lines have basically good premises, but the acting is more horrible than the stories. If the actors were better I would certainly rate this series higher. However, that being said, the stories are entertaining enough to take on along plane flight or long wait at the airport to help pass the time."
1,Poor quality and really predicatable,"There was no suspense, the acting and cinematography was terrible. You could predict the entire episode within the first 5-10 min. It was even really entertaining. I only watched the first episode but after that I really didn't want to pay any money on the slim chance it would get better."
4,Pretty good show,I have only watched this one episode but I liked it. It was worth the money I spent on it.
3,Dog goodies.,Collar and leash are great. The tg could have been a little sturdier. The name plate will not sta attached to the back . I would Have preferred something like a metal keychain and dealt with the name another way.
1,Nasty stuff,"I like some of the other Walden Farms products -- I gave their chocolate dip 4 stars -- but this one is not very good. I tried dipping different kinds of fruit into it, tried it in combination with the chocolate dip, and finally gave up and threw the rest of it away. The cellulose gel Walden Farms uses to give its sauces body seems to have a slight spicy/sour ""bite"" to it; it doesn't bother me in the chocolate dip or in most of their dressings, but here it ruins the flavor."
2,The worst stuff ever,"I am a sugar free, fat free, low calorie junkie! I have probably tried and loved many low calorie products in the market, which is why I was so excited for calorie free marshmellow dip. I had planned on making low calorie smores, rice krispy treats and a great sugar free hot chocolate.Well as soon as I opened the product the consistancy bothered me, it wasnt anywhere near gooey or marshmellow like.Then came the taste, it was like chemical plastic! I took one spoonful and immediatly felt like I wanted to be sick. The taste is horrible and the consistency is even worse!Skip this product until Walden farms can reformulate!(Their Fruit spreads and strawberry syrups are good though)"
4,Great dip for strawberries,"The dip alone has a rather funny after taste but when i tried dipping my strawberries in, it was Excellent! It definitely settles my sweet tooth without any guilt!"
1,aweful,"I must be genetically able to taste a chemical in this product that the people who gave it stars can not.This substance tastes like screaming death.The chocolate I could at least swallow, my body rejected this whole sale.""Walden Farms"" is a lie. There was no farm even remotely involved in the production of this product. There is nothing in it that is food."
2,Not A Marshmallow Dip Substitute,"Despite my concerns over the taste of calorie free food, I tried the chocolate dip and was amazed. Can't be eaten plain but was very good paired with other things (strawberries are great!) So, I decided to give the rest of the line a try. This one was a flop and a waste of four dollars I'm afraid. It has a very strong chemical taste to it, one that stays in your mouth for a while which is a shame because they've gotten the texture down. I don't know that I would ever buy it again (depends on whether or not I can make something with it, the cheesecake that someone suggested sounds promising) but I will never try to eat it as I would marshmallow fluff. Even on bread with peanut butter it is pretty awful tasting. Unless you're a daring low cal baker and think you can make something of it, steer clear."
1,BLEH,"This could be the nastiest stuff I've ever tasted. After paying $4 for the jar, I was excited to try it. So I took a spoonful and tried some. BAD IDEA. This has a horrible after taste and is just gross. I do, however, like the Rasperry Salad Dressing by Walden Farms."
1,All the goodness every body needs,"Cellulose Gel, Lactic Acid, Sucralose, Titanium Dioxide, Salt, Xanthan Gum, and Potassium Sorbate.....yum can't wait to get me some more titanium dioxide in me...how great does that sound!"
5,This book rocks.,"I'm not even finished with this book (170 pages left to go) but I feel compelled to write a review because this book is simply great. It's emotional, it's suspenseful, it's beautifully written... in short, it's everything you're looking for. It's one of those books where you don't want it to end, so it's actually fortunate it's so hefty. Don't read anymore about it - just order it. You won't regret it."
4,Not even finished yet,"I'm not even finished yet (300 pages to go) but I love this book regardless of what happens. Mr Chandra gives us a story as messy and complex as India itself. I'm not Indian (although I know several) and have never been to India (hope to some day), but the major (and many minor) characters struck me as complex and all too human, and I'll be very surprised if I ever visity Mumbai some day and it isn't very much like the way Mr Chandra describes it. I'm struck by how many reviewers said that the ending fell flat. While I hope for some answers/conclusions by the end, this novel is very much about the journey--the destination for which is merely an excuse for the trip."
5,Great Book!,"If you loved ""Shogun,"" you'll love ""Sacred Games"" too. I was sad when I finished reading it, just like I was with ""Shogun."" Luckily, it's 900 pages long so there's lots of enjoyment before the book comes to an end.And you've not only read a good story, you've learned a lot about what life is like in modern India.""Sacred Games"" ought to be a runaway best-seller."
2,Not worth the time!,"A weak story of the intertwined lives of movie stars, underworld dons, shady police inspectors in the ever-evolving city of Mumbai. The characters are weak and events seem to be taken from newspaper clippings related to Dawood Ibrahim or even an infamous movie of Ram Gopal Verma.The constant cussing and local slang is the only taste of Mumbai that the author cares to provide and nothing of the vitality that makes Mumbai ever comes on the surface.Narrative skills are worthy of being compared to the skills of Jackie Collins!"
2,Snoozer,Sacred games almost ends before it begins. Chandra wallows in mediocrity as he struggles to develop and redevelop characters who seem to loose their identity as he describes in never ending detail the daily life and customs in a particular section of India. The plot is straight out of a (you pick it) James Bond movie with The God Father thrown in. A most boring read.
1,Over the top,"The title, first of all, in no way has anything to do with the bulk, and I mean BULK, of this book. This book should have been edited and re-edited to 400 pages. The repetitiveness of character descriptions were boring and I kept wanting to say, Hey, I got it! The Hindu language is wholly unfamiliar to me and the glossary was of very little help. However, I learned how to swear in Hindi just by reading the first 50 pages.The ending was flat and uninspiring with an extra chapter tossed in that had nothing to do with the preceding 875 pages! An epic novel? This doesn't come close to anything that Clavell, Edw. Rutherford or Robert Elegant has written. I'm disappointed that I wasted so much time on plowing through this book."
2,Most boring thriller in...the whole world,"Look, this book is not bad reading in terms of the writing? Does that make sense? In any case, I was kind of hoping for something that would be all zig-zaggy and page turning. Chandra is a good writer but the whole story is not super interesting.This sounds like a contradiction, but that might be the point. It's like a great car running on bad gas.So, don't look for a thriller, or even a police crazy. It's like an NPR thriller. Terry Gross...why did you kill my teacher? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?"
3,Difficult and confusing to start,"I haven't put this much time into reading a book since college. I finally wrote a cheat sheet on all the characters and unfamiliar words. For the first few chapters I was completely confused, but the characters and the story really fell into place a couple hundred pages down the road, and was a good read."
3,"LONG, LONG and LONG","Yes, well written. The characters are convincing. The story is the everyday life in Mumbai's underworld. Yes, that exists, even in India. But did we have to go through this tome to find that out!The saving grace is the taut writing, but how long can that carry one, especially holding the heavy book?"
4,Change the title,"If Chandra's book ever goes into a second edition, he and his editor should change the title to ""Bombay"" or ""Mumbai"". What are ""sacred games"" anyway? Perhaps Hindis know, but for this American reader, a slight allusion to life being a game does not amount to a clear and distinctive religious view of life and the universe.But no matter. This sprawling portrait of modern, corrupt and loveable Mumbai is like a film noir story inflated by a passion for movies. Indians seem obsessed by films, and Chandra uses his own passion to create a novel that is grandly suspenseful as well as spectacular in ambiance. I felt as if he had watched and rechanneled his enjoyment of every crime series he's ever watched on TV or on the silver screen, especially ""24"" and ""The Godfather"".Whatever its sources, ""Sacred Games"" is a great read."
1,A Dreadful Time In India.,"I had high hopes for this novel, as I thought we had another Khaled Hosseini in our midst. However, it was unfortunately not to be. This paperweight of a book is quite a bore. The main character is as mundane as sheet rock. I could not finish this tome. The author seemed to have a dreadful lack of self-confidence in his literary acumen. So much so that he went overboard trying to make up for his shortcomings. The proses continue listlessly ad infinitum. He seemingly writes just to fill the page."
2,Is it over yet?,"Sacred Games is too complex for its own good. The main story line of Sartaj Singh and Ganesh Gaitonde is fantastic. It's all the ""interwoven"" story lines that interfere with the flow of the book. This book was a tough read in that it was hard work to maintain my interest. As soon as Chandra had me hooked he'd go off on a tangent again...for an entire chapter. And when I was hooked again...he'd go off on a tangent again...There are better books about Mumbai (Bombay) out there...Shantaram and Maximum City."
4,Epic BM of the Northland,"Though recently released, Quorthon claims this material hails from the era of ""Blood, Fire Death"" and his masterpiece ""Hammerheart"". The music is more Folk/Black with obvious old school Punk influences. As usual, the recording quality is not the best, but it does boast some nice samples and catchy rythmns. The vocals are all clean, with a few variations, and on ""The One-eyed Old Man"" a neat sort of narration is given by Mr. Tim Earl in verse. The whole CD, if you are not familiar with the Epic music, tells a story, in this case a story of a boy whose village is razed in the intro and first song. Each song thereafter tells a part of his quest for vengence all across the Northland and even the realms of the Gods. A good album, but not as good as Quorthon's earlier ""Hammerheart"". The book with the CD is VERY nice and lyrics are given in both English and German. END"
5,Epic Metal,"Continuing in the vein of Twilight of the Gods, Bathory releases another album of epic Viking metal that far surpasses anything he has previously done, and can safely be labeled as the best example of Viking metal yet to be released. The songs are grand, sweeping, utilizing a full choir to enhance the music. Hardcore fans of Bathory's more straightforward Black Metal approach may disapprove, but in truth the Viking metal approach-with it's more complex arrangements and clean vocals-is more powerful than the most fast paced metal record out there-and is easier to listen to."
1,Boooorrrrriiiinnnnngggg!,"While this book is factual, it is the dryest Psychology book that I have ever read. Not Recommneded."
5,I loved this book!!!!!!!!,"As a beginning carver,I found this book to be a wealth of information. The projects were easy to understand and the steps easy to follow. I really like how much information was included and hope to see much more from this author."
3,not for beginners,"For a beginner who never carved before this book was difficult, drawing in the patterns, carving the eyes, nose ,etc. I don't think the writer had the beginner in mind."
1,Do Not Buy This Book!,This book is not worth the paper it's printed on. These projects would take you weeks to complete and they aren't even artistic! What a waste of money and time!
3,just ok,I bought two. They are basically as expected although my girls say they are too hard. Also one of them had a weird gray stain on the fabric under the fur. I would have returned it but Santa brought it and it was too awkward to exchange a Santa gift as large as this without arousing suspicion!
5,"First really effective relief for my dry, itchy skin","I got a free sample of this product from my favorite massage therapist, and it's the only thing that's sure to work when my skin gets really dry and itchy. I am never without a small bottle when traveling by air (or any other method, for that matter). Fast, long lasting relief!! I'm hooked."
5,energy suspension review,Product was as described and shipping was great. Product is great!! Im satified and I would buy from this seller again!!!!
2,Good character recognition but . . .,"I found the character recognition of this software package to be very good, but the package has a major drawback: unless your scanner is equiped with an automatic feeder, the software will let you scan documents of only one page or less to a single Word file. This requires copying and pasting operations for any document more than one page long. Way too tedious."
1,Ridiculous Pricing,"I can't believe this item is priced at $168.00 here. I was expecting to pay about $35.00. This is ridiculous. I went to another site and paid $34.95 plus shipping. I expect to come here and find bargains after all. With all your resources, you should be able to have decent competitive prices."
5,Highly recommended,"Great Player so far. Have watched a couple movies--Lord of the Rings, Star Wars--flawless viewing. It plays DVD-RW (have had success with Sony and Memorex DVD-RW discs burned from Sony DRU500A). I have it hooked through a Sony Receiver and the surround sound is excellent. Have yet to try the MP3 function. Appears to be a great buy. Highly recommended."
1,Bad apple,"Bought this DVD from Amazon as a result of the reviews. However, once connected to the TV, the unit began opening and shutting the disk drawer and wouldn't stop. On top of that when I was able to load a DVD and some CD's the display keep saying ""NO DISK"". Amazon was great, send me a UPS sticker to send the unit back. Unfortunately they could not replace it. So am shopping for a Sony."
2,won't play CD's,"This unit plays movies but will not play a music CD. It starts to play, jumps and starts over. I have tried many CDs and it isn't just older ones but it treats new ones the same way. Unfortunately, I didn't test a CD while it was in the first three months warranty. I am now trying to get it fixed but can't get a repair scheduled within two weeks at the earliest. I am very unimpressed."
5,Lisa Reardon is simply amazing!,"Blameless and Billy Dead were both so touching and honest that I wrote to Lisa via her website. Not only did she write me back, but she asked for my address and mailed me a free signed copy of The Mercy Killers! She is as kind as she is talented. Thank you Lisa for your amazing novels which have enriched my life!"
1,Avoid at all costs!,"I have not found a more fitting example of the total loss of morality among humans today than the creation of the Hampster Dance. Truly, the time of judgement is upon us all if such a product has been mass produced on disc for people to buy. DO NOT BUY THIS - it will be time out of your life that you won't get back"
1,The far superior CUBAN BOYS' version,"This single is a total rip-off of the track ""Cognoscenti Vs Intelligentsia"" released by a band called the CUBAN BOYS which reached #4 in the UK charts last December. Their single started as an underground favourite and was so good that it crossed over to the main charts. I would recommend that you listen to the original and best interpretation of the old Disney tune which was released on EMI."
1,WAKE UP ITS A DISNEY REMIX!!,"This song is from Disney's Cartoon Movie 'Robin Hood'. It's part of the intro song that the Rooster sings as they gang is marching along and the titel comes up. They took one stanza of this song, looped it, and sped it up. Thats all folks. Does Disney know about this 'Hamster Dance'?OK, I like the site since I first saw it, but COME ON!! A CD?!?!! If you have money to waste on this, then I find it sad figurin' all the starvin' people that could feed their family for days on what you might waste on this cd. Stop and think about it."
1,The most disturbing piece of sound sold anywhere...,"Yes I've visted the site. Yes I showed it to my friends. Yes I've listened to this cd. And yes I'm going to throw it in the street and hope a truck runs over it several times so it can never be played again. The first time, it's cute. The second time, it's still cute. Around the 10th time, I wanted to chuck it out a window. DO NOT BUY THIS IT WILL ONLY BRING YOU MENTAL ANGUISH AND YOU WILL HAVE LOST 5 BUCKS."
1,It would be 0 stars,It's a frickin hampster!!!!! It's a 15 second loop track!!!!!!! This woman needs a life and so does anyone that actually will pay 5-15 dollars on a hampsterdance CD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Crag no like hampster. hampster meat good!! hampster music,Crag like meat! Crag no like hampster music! Crag like Hmapster meat! Hampster meat goooood! Music bag Crag Scratch! Crag munch meat! Crag sleep now!
5,Hampster Dance,This CD is based on the original HampsterDance website. The music is very cute! I enjoy it very much!
5,AWESOME SONG!,"I heard this song on the radio station B104, a station that serves Allentown, Pennsylvania. They used to play it on the morining show with Ken Matthews. It's a silly song, but I love it! I would love to have this single, but unfortunetely, I've only heard it on the radio! You should still try to get it anyway!"
4,great quality and value,"these sockets have the 'flank' drive like snap-on sockets and almost as good fit and finish for a fraction of the price. one noticeable difference is they are slightly deeper, both in total depth and the inside shoulder is deeper down (allowing the bolt/nut to go in further) which can be undesirable at times. overall still a great set of sockets and lifetime warranty, although I've never actually warrantied anything with gearwrench. I have lots of gearwrench tools and they've held up exceptionally well for years of daily use."
5,Refreshing mints,If you like strong mints you will enjoy these. They are smooth and creamy. The small packages are just enough to feel satisfied.
4,Perfect Party Accessory,"The Mr. Bar-B-Q Condiment Tray has been the perfect serving accessory for buffets, cookouts, and tailgate parties. Made of stainless steel, the six compartment tray is hinged with a thick, hard plastic cover. The six 2"" deep plastic tubs are dishwasher safe. The unit also comes with six stainless steel serving spoons. Quality built, I highly recommend the durable Mr. Bar-B-Q Condiment Tray for any event."
3,Good Insight - From a Strongly Christian Perspective,"I bought this book for my husband, when he took a new job requiring lots of travel. While there is lots of good insight to be had, the book has a strong fundamental Christian bias that was not mentioned on Amazon. My husband is turned off by all things religious, so was taken aback at what he felt was a hidden spiritual agenda behind it. We were disappointed that someone hasn't written a book on this important topic without the religious bias.Bottom Line: Great book for the Christian traveler, or those interested in or at least tolerant of a strongly religious perspective. Some good insight to be gleaned, if you can muck through the doctrinal bias. However I REALLY wish someone else would address this topic crucial to so many couples, without bringing in religion."
4,handy Wine caddy,This is an artistically pleasing and useful item.I gave it as a gift and the recipient was delighted.It is made of high quality material and i wouldlike to own one myself.
4,Best Picnic Ever,so i bought this bag for my girlfriend after seeing it on amazon and was pretty amazed. it looks much cooler in person and the bag was made of great quality material. everything seemed to work great except the bottle stop which i bought a seperate one with the bag anyways. keeps the wine cool and made for a really nice relaxing day. very cool:)
4,Just what I wanted!,"I received this Wine holder within a few day.....as is always the case with Amazon.....and was exactly what we wanted! We go to many functions at our Clubhouse and they are usually BYOB, so this makes transport very easy. I didn't give 5 stars, because there were some things we really didn't need.....cheese knife, board, etc. All in all, great product."
5,Great for traveling!,"My husband and I found this for when we take trips. Wine is one thing that is hard to transport without worrying about breaking a bottle. I came across this and ordered it in time for Christmas! We like that everything is easily able to travel with. Who cares if the wine glasses are plastic?? If you are staying in a hotel or a cabin I'd rather have a plastic wine glass to wash than worry about breaking it. Although if they would crack or break, going down to local Dollar tree and getting glass ones to replace it is no biggie.Can't wait to travel with this in a few weeks..and we like that everything is ready for wine and cheese!"
2,lousy movie just want to jump on the band wagon,"a going-nowhere movie. trying too hard to be cool and a wannabe of the genre of fast and furious but just failed in a hollow black hole. don't know how and where all these donogooders could afford so many and so expensive bikes, or they were just provided by the producer? rented? or leased? you think that fast speed and thought-to-be cool graphics would make you keep your interest undying? sorry, senor, i fell asleep so many times and tried to keep awake by nodding my butthead uncontrollablely during those meaningless bike racing or chasing or whatever and stupid dialogues."
5,Great movie!,I enjoyed this movie very much! An interesting story line and positive images of people of color.Makes me love Laurence Fishburne even more!
5,A different slice of life...for a change,"If you are looking for a film with great performances, interesting characters, intelligent drama and some fun action sequences then check ""Biker Boyz"" out. It is a great story set in a sub-culture of the multi-ethnic bike clubs that exist nationwide. I saw this movie in the theater and thought it was a lot a fun. Some of you folks take your action movies too seriously; if you want thin storylines and non-stop pointless racing look elsewhere, there are plenty of bad choices out there, This isn't one of them."
5,Great Movie,Biker Boyz did a great job of highlighting the African Amrerican sport bike racing culture. Nice bike scenes with a family tie in. I have missed Reggie Rock Bythewood's work since Fox took the original NY Undercover of the air.Well done.
4,difference between men and boys is the lessons they learn,"now that i seen the movie i like it very much. i thought it was going to be fishburne's childish attempts at box-office sucess but it is a good movie blythewood did a very good film well acted(even though my girlfriend thinks lisa bonet was miscasted) eye candy for the ladies with all the beefcake brothas and the action and sexy ladies for us fellas. even though it meandered a little (with the father discovery)i was entertained, the movie is based on african-american biker clubs that sprang up in l.a. in the last 10 to 15 years so to you negative reviewers who say this can't be true i reminds of those people who said the movie bommerang wasn't true bollocks. i liked it and hopefully there will be no sequels it ended nicely."
1,Bullsh**,"I hope any retard who actually liked this piece of crap dies tomorrow. You're stupid and pathetic, and I feel sorry for you."
2,Boring and Mindless,"This movie was not good. I hope that people will not compare this movie to The Fast and the Furious, because that movie is an Oscar winner in comparison to this. Even the special effects are lousy. In Biker Boyz, a young motorcycle enthusiast wants to become a member of the Black Nights, but he can't, and then his father is killed in a motorcycle accident, so he starts his own biker group because he's angry with the world. Under the right direction and the right talents, this could have made for an emotional movie sidelined by decent action, but it's far from that. Instead, it's a bunch of lousy motorcycle races coupled with an uninspired, no brains plot. I actually had the urge to leave a few times during the movie. It's way too long for how boring it is, and there isn't a single shred of wisdom or advice in the conclusion of the movie. Don't go see this lousy movie."
3,"Cool bike scenes, poor movie overall","I love to ride. I own a customized R6 that I rebuilt myself. So I'm not some cage riding adrenaline-wannabe. The movie was awful for its poor writing and even worse race sequences. No offence to the writers/directors, but a quarter mile on a nitrous-enhanced Hayabusa takes under 9 seconds. So ya, make those races just a tad shorter, and believable. And race tires don't grip do well on dirt roads. But if you just want to see this movie for the entertainment of checking out a lot of sweet looking bikes, it's fine. But plain and simple - if Smoke's as good a driver as they portray him, then he could never lose to Kid (it's as simple as a GSXR1300 Hayabusa vs. a GSXR1000 on a straightaway - the one with more HP is going to win - there's little skill involved).My two cents.JK"
3,Dirt racing,I just want ask the director of the movie if he or she ever tried to race a 200hp motorbike on a dirt road and then tried to stop it. The last scene in the movie is so unreal that it spoils the whole movie.Keep it realWouter
4,Good entertainment,"Purchasing this movie was very easy, I was notified when it was shipped. The product was very good! My husband loves movies and this is one of his favorites."
3,"Good, but Could Have Been More Original","""Biker Boyz"" was a pretty good movie in that the motorcycle racing scenes were very captivating. It's obviously just like ""The Fast and the Furious"" except motorcycles are used instead of cars. Some may say that the plot was sort of thin and unoriginal, but in some aspects it was very interesting. There were a few suprises in there that dropped my jaw, but overall I would say that this is a cool movie to watch that doesn't make you think too hard. It is quite entertaining and the performances by Laurence Fishburne, Derek Luke, Lisa Bonet, Brendan Fehr, and Larenz Tate were really good. Even Kid Rock did a good job!I would suggest this film to people who liked ""The Fast and the Furious."" They're the same type of exciting action-packed dramas."
3,it was ok for me,"3 1/2 starsit was ok\good for me I like the bike riding, the little action and it was fun good to enjoy it one of those now and then movies to enjoy....."
2,pretty dull,"Lots of nice bikes but this movie was way to serious and emotional to have a name like ""biker boys""... ..You should probably rent it before u buy it and if ur lookin for a real action packed biker movie get ""torque"" instead..O, and the special features were as dull as the movie"
3,Biker Baby Boyz in the 'Hood...,"....You'll see what will develop in the plot a mile or two away. But that won't get in the way of your enjoyment of this speed fest featuring L. Fishburn, Orlando Jones (a MC gang mouthpiece called Soul Train who turns out to be a lawyer), Kid Rock, Lawrenz Tate and....Hillman College kids (? Whaaaat!? They became MC gang members?) Kadeem Hardison and ueberbabe Lisa Bonet. Actually, Bonet was Zen-ing on her own thing and the cast and crew were invited to film photos of her and with her. Just kiddin'. Anyhoo, I love the speed and I love the stunts the younger moto cyclists performed. I dig also the loads of leathers..."
2,Not a thrill ride,"I had high hopes for this movie just based on the folks attached to it -- Lawrence Fishburne, Derek Luke, Orlando Jones ( who I never liked before Drumline), Vanessa Bell Calloway and Reggie Bythewood behind the camera. I don't know anything about bikes or riding, but the movie seemed like it would be an entertaining bit of drama. It wasn't. It was just too slow and was hampered by uninspired dialogue. I think the actors did a good job with what they had to work with, but this was a bad movie. Luke is the stereotypical young buck rebel without a cause. Fishburne is the old dawg trying to fend off the youngsters. And I agree with one of the previous reviewers that the ending is totally anticlimatic.I'm only giving it two stars because of the stunt scenes."
2,"MAN, THEY NEED TO GIVE THESE TYPE OF MOVIES A REST","A GROUP OF YOUNG OFFICE WORKERS COMPETE AGAINST EACH OTHER EVERY WEEKEND ON THE UNDERGROUND MOTORCYCLE RACING CIRCUIT. HAS SOME GOOD RACES, NICE LOOKING MOTORCYCLES, AND SOME GOOD STUNTS. BUT, EVERYTHING THAT GOES ON IN BETWEEN THE RACES ARE BORING. HAS SOME GOOD ACTORS IN ITS CAST, BUT EVEN LAURENCE FISHBOURNE CAN'T SAVE THIS ONE FROM BEING A LOSER. ESCAPES ONE STAR RATING DUE TO SOME GOOD RACES. THIS IS A MOVIE YOU CAN AFFORD TO MISS."
3,1st movie purchased,"it was okay... downloading hd top quality took too much time.. It wasnt bad, just not something great. My son enjoys it... thats whats important"
1,It doesn't even work!!,I spent my money and the movie won't even play in any DVD player or Game Center I put it in!!!!!!! It was a waste of money getting this and I'm sure the seller knew it wouldn't work.
4,more Hilarious,I forgot to add that 'Fettucini' is my favorite track. It's so funny! Okay...I'm done.
3,Better in person,"I had the luck to catch Kyle Cease in person and thought he was much funnier. The acts he created for this CD caused me to stare dumbly at my CD player, though the standup sections were humorous, though better life as expected!"
5,Great storytelling,"This book is set in London in 1899. A leading art critic has been murdered. Now I hesitate to read books about the art world because either the writer talks down to the reader, or a non-art historian hasn't a clue what it's all about. This writer manages to explain the art world quickly, simply and effectively. I understood and I didn't feel patronized.This is a good story; it moves right along with plenty of action. The characters are so well drawn that you don't even notice the writer doing it. The background is authentic and the various motivations very true to the time, the setting and the plot. The dialogue was crisp and the transitions barely noticeable.This is John Buchan meeting Anne Perry, with the addition of a sense of humor. I really enjoyed it."
2,Death of an Old Master,"Pretty decent stuff, but lazy writing. For example: author uses the word ""prefabricated"" (a term first coined in 1937) to describe an observation by one of the characters about a cathedral....in 1900. Just lazy! Dickinson's next book (I thought I'd try one more because I enjoy historical fiction), Death of a Chancellor, exhibits some of the same lazy writing from Death of an Old Master. Somewhat formulaic and thrown together."
5,Hmmm smells maaarvelous!,"This is an amazing product. Have been using it for years now. It smells REALLY good; and it (the smell) lasts as much as two weeks! But somehow, where I ordered it from last time did not have it; go figure. So, I googled the product and up came Amazon.Com. When am I going to learn to always check Amazon.Com FIRST?!!! The price was right so I ordered a lot...No, I mean A LOT!!! Use it for my American Pitbull, Honey Bee Bunny Bunches of Oats, and for all of my short and long haired Tabby Cats, T.H.E. (Thomas Hewitt Edward) Cat, Mewsette Little Darlin', Mr. Man Kimba Cracky Bunnyman Ootney and our newest addition, Max-A-Minion Kitty Foofoo Thumper McLovin! Bathing the cats once to three times a year, and the dog about once a month, this product helps protect against fleas and ticks year round. Use it with other protection! But remember go to this supplier via AMAZON.COM FIRST! Like DUH! :)"
4,Pretty Good Boots,"Bought these boots 6 months ago. I really like em! They offer good comfort at a really affordable price! My only complaints are that they get water spots VERY easily, they don't have speed-laces, and they seem shorter than 9"". Not too huge of a deal but just minor things I'd change if I were the manufacturer.Still a great boot that I love to wear."
4,"Nice Boots, Watch your Size !!! HAD TO SEND A PAIR BACK TOO SMALL","Nice Boots, Watch your Size !!! HAD TO SEND A PAIR BACK TOO SMALL. I have an old pair of these 11.5, Made in China.I ordered same sz 11.5, when i got in the Mail, and tried on, too Small. They were 11.5 not made in China, Made in TIWAIN, GUESS THERE IS A Diffferance. Sent back and ordered sz 12 W.amazon Treated me right ! tHANKS !! NICE BOOTS..Watch the sz, run small."
4,Very nice boots,There are a ton of this style boots out there to choose from and I mainly picked these because of the price and it had good reviews. I'm happy with the fit and feel of the boots and traction on snow is great. They are however very very slick inside on tile floors when you come in from the rain or snow.They are also a little bit of a pain to get on and off because they dont have a zippered side. When I'm ready for my next pair I will get ones that have a zipper on the side for easy on and off.
1,not what I was thinking that order,"I personally do not like, as I saw them potresen.Te are some more artificial leather that looks like a raincoat.A customer read above is very happy in Kabul, but I am afraid that if you pull them out of the box to crack the skin, so hurry to sell them to anyone in Kabul who will like them.I thought that SWAT is a proven company and sell only quality goods and are therefore sympathetic to the price, but it turned out that for less money you can not buy quality."
3,AN IMMENSE RED,"Mario Castigiani is a internationally accredited Psychic. He is called into action to help find a murderer.Beafort Tyler, the police chief of Floraville, Georgia calls upon Mario to help him prove that an old black man named Roy Washington (who was a local celebrity from the civil rights days) was murdered and not a suicide as the coroner thinks. Roy was found hanging in his kitchen. Does Roy's death have any thing to do with the hanging of Chief Tyler's predecessor, Chief Rutherford Kendall? He was also found hanging, but police officers usually use their weapons.AN UNCERTAIN CURRENCY is exquisitely written, with really entertaining and amiable characters, and a plot that will hold you enraptured all the way to theclimatic ending.AN UNCERTAIN CURRENCY has everything that an immense book should have, homicide, mystery, affection, eroticism, psychological tension, and racial discrimination all rolled into a nice tight mix."
4,This book shows how other countries are similar to ours.,"1. I think a kid would like this book because it's short and has many pictures. 2. I think a kid would not like this book because it's not funny. 3. If I could change one thing about this book, it would be to have more words. 4. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 I choose 4."
5,This book was GREAT!!!!!!!!!!,"Yes, this book was GREAT. If I could give it 20 stars, I would. I keep a log of the books I have read. When I went to put the date I read this one next to the name, I noticed that I made notations by the other Christiane Heggan's books I have read. They were GREAT, and EXCELLENT. Evidently Mrs. Heggan only knows how to write GREAT and EXCELLENT books. Believe me, if you pick up a book by her, you CANNOT GO WRONG. She is the greatest of authors."
5,Abraham Lincoln: The Prairie Years and the War Years,Carl Sandburg captures the essence of a president struggling with the many different forces plaguing the nation. He does this with humor and insight as to how Lincoln navigated the many personalities and issues. There are many lessons for today.
4,Surprisingly good!,"This is the Best EOS Album I know. While, for me, ""CRIMSON"", is the worst Death Metal - forget it - music in general - album that collected all the aspects I need to throw an album on the mainstreet, this one is really good. Sure, they got no big innovation but they got fun while they play, and you hear it. This album reminds me of early Entombed or Dismember ( Demon I ) and if you like them too, don't hesitate to buy this album!"
5,Cool!,"Sometimes releases like this are a drag. They come up with the dregs that they somehow missed before. Some of the other Steve Goodman live CDs have been a little uneven. I thought Live Wire was solid, consistent, and a great addition to the Goodman library. I'd never heard some of these before. It was a lot of fun!"
5,One Of My Favorite LIVE releases - An Easy Ride!,LIVE WIRE is smooth...just like an old smoothie...I really like the performance on this show!It has some of my favorite versions embedded in this set.Quite a few of them really do more justice to the songsin a LIVE setting right here on this performance.A stand out show!Top Notch Sound!SUPPORT STEVE GOODMAN AND FAMILYBUY ALL HIS ALBUMS/CD'S
2,"If the watch fits, wear it","This watch does not have an expansion band, as advertised. In fact the only way to adjust the band size is to remove links from the band - a rather complicated process."
1,Timex - Very Disappointing!,"I like the looks of this watch, but I was very disappointed with the indigo lighting... The light stop working after only weeks... I tried to replace the batteries and that didn't fix it... I sent it back and got a new one, but the same thing happened to it. I've had other timex's with the light feature and never had these problems... I won't buy another one after this experience!"
2,Cheap wiring.,I really like this interface but the wiring is so thin it often stopped working until I played with the wiring to get it going again.
2,Just not worth it,"So, this unit worked ok although the volume coming out of the stereo was significantly lower than the volume of the CD player. And yes, I did update to the latest firmware.Like other reviewers, I sometimes had to switch back and forth from CD to radio source because the unit would stop working seemingly at random. To boot, the cables are weak and I got a short in mine. Sending back to the seller today."
2,Cute but the pepper shaker constantly clogs,"Bought this set a few years ago. While it's cute on the table, the pepper shaker constantly stays clogged. For this reason, I can't recommend the set."
1,people-what's wrong with you?,"I bought this flick while ago based on reviews and now I have nowhere to complain. To all who wrote these reviews--please state your benchmark movie so guy like me can make educated quess. For example for me it is ""Sleepless city"" and to compare both will be insult to humanity that far they are apart. If you dont have standards state it. Thank you."
5,Not a guide book,"The ""A to Zed,"" as it is called in London, is a must-have whether you are going to the city for a week, a semester, or the rest of your life. Londoners themselves carry the book, because it is so useful for navigating the otherwise confusing maze of city streets (which do not come even close to conforming to the traditional city grid that those of us who've been to say New York City might expect from a big city).Do not buy this book if you are looking for a traditional tour book, with restaurant reviews, hotel recommendations, and price listings. You won't find them here. Do buy this book if you plan to move about the city on your own, independent of a tour guide. Not only is it easier to reference, it's much less conspicuous than a cumbersome, folding map."
4,Strangely paced,"The book is actually quite good, however it is hard to understand to what audience he aims it. At times the book seems to assume a good level of previous familiarity with the American Revolution from which he would add a greater military and political background than you were familiar with (specially a more foreign background which is rather nice). However, at other points he changes and quotes the Declaration of independence and some of its writing for a whole chapter.Probably a good book for people who are not historically illiterate, but are also not historians. Bad book as an introduction, probably a good second book on the American Revolution."
4,the short and tall of it review,"An amazing story of the struggle of human existence. Everyone sees the outside personna, but if they look long enough the inner beauty comes though. Put yourself in the author's shoes and you realize that life is a contant stuggle. This book teaches us that acceptance of who we are, asking for help, and having the courage to do whatever our hearts desire, we can achieve our dreams no matter our size, abilities, or appearance. We are who we make ourselves to be. Our biggest disability is ourselves. Read the book -- you'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll love, and most importantly you'll learn."
3,"Great, but glorifying","This a good read. I could hardly put it down and read it in two days. My only beef with the book is that it overtly glorifies Columbus and neglects to even recognize the brutalities that he oversaw while in the ""New World."" The fact that an entire race of people is now extinct because of Columbus' actions is not even mentioned in the book. When Dugard mentions such brutalities, he indicates that they are the fault of someone else. Further he fails to mention the journal entries in which Columbus completely dehumanizes the ""Indians"" and talks about they will all be brutally subjugated by the Spanish. The author does take care to mention, however, that some of the Indians ""wept"" when Columbus was rescued and left them behind.Other than that, the details of the journeys and the shipwreck were harrowing, interesting and compelling. Good read."
5,Somebody pinch me!!!,"I must be dreaming!! This dip, along with the Chocolate Syrup, is saving me from wanting to cheat on a weight loss program I started a month ago! A few tablespoons a day of this stuff (or swigs of the syrup), and I'm good to go. I admit, it has a bit of an after taste, but it doesn't take away from the initial chocolate burst at all. The dip is a lot like pudding, especially after being in the fridge for a while--it gets really thick and cold. I absolutely LOVE this stuff! HIGHLY recommended (but don't bother with the salad dressings--uh uh...)..."
1,Horrible,"I really wanted to like this stuff but it tastes really bad. When I opened the jar and smelled it I thought I'd hit the low cal jackpot, it smells very chocolatey. However it tastes strange, king of like sour cocoa with a horrid chemical aftertaste. Ever use hairspray and get a mouthful of the residual fog by accident or get shampoo in your mouth? Imagine that that happened right after you took a swig of rancid cocoa and that's what this stuff tastes like. Sad thing is I bought this and several other WF products after reading a bunch of feel good reviews on the net. Seriously it tastes bad and I'm an avid consumer of low cal foods most people abhor, like Promise. Sheesh I ate it twenty minutes ago and my mouth still tastes like a mini Exon Valdez spilled in my mouth. Blech."
1,Tastes like chemicals sprinkled in artificial cocoa,"I don't know if there is such a thing as artificial cocoa, but this stuff doesn't taste anything like chocolate, yet, if anyone were to ask me what exactly it tasted like I would end up saying it tastes of chemicals in some sort of strange cocoa type substance. I eat a lot of diet foods and strange fake foods (e.g., various fake meats), but this stuff is gross. It doesn't satisfy a sweet tooth and I don't really see the point in dipping fruit in it so that you can make your fruit taste of chemicals. I even tried it on regular ice cream (eliminating much of the diet aspect), and it made perfectly delicious ice cream taste of chemicals. After giving it several tries on different days hoping I wouldn't have to consider my money I paid for this wasted, I ended up tossing it because there's no way to make this stuff taste good."
2,"Probably better than starvation, but not by much.","This tastes kind of like chocolate... except for the aftertaste. I've never tasted hairspray, but I suspect that's what the aftertaste of this tastes like. In all seriousness, this is not very good. I finally pitched it the other day after it sat in my fridge uneaten for an unreasonable amount of time. The aftertaste was unbearable for me. But if you're on an extreme diet, it's probably better than complete chocolate deprivation."
4,good sub for jelly,I don't really like walden farms products but this one is pretty good. Its very similar to jelly.
5,is this for real???,"amazing...is the only word i can say to describe it!!!!! Now for those who aren't on a strict diet and arent used to not eating chocolate foods as much wont find this as satisfying, but still will. however, for those who are have been missing that chocolate this is HEAVEN!!!! i JUST got it and kinda hard to just eat by itself bc it has a different after taste, but eating it with anything else u can't even tell!!!!!! i ate it with a sugar free vanilla pudding (this stuff is good too, only 60 calories, one gram of fat and no sugar) i mixed it with that and added some fiber one cereal to it and bam it was like my only little ice cream mix SOOO GOOD..also dipped a piece of light wheat bread (only 40 calories) into the chocolate dip and it was like a little chocolate donut/cake/eclair!! AMAZING!!! HIGHLY RECCOMEND IT IF U NEED THAT CHOCOLATE !!! :):)"
2,okay...sort of,"I thought I would try to cut a few points out of my day by using this chocolate dip to help my cravings...It tasted okay. It was okay with fruit, but the fruit was way sweeter than the chocolate. It almost tasted like a very bitter chocolate. I think if I didn't eat any chocolate for a couple months then ate this I would like it, but that's not the case. It will probably sit in my fridge until it expires."
4,Not half-bad,"Nobody will mistake this stuff for a fondue pot full of melted 65% Valrhona, but I think this is pretty good for dipping strawberries into for a daytime snack. The trick is that it's a dip, so you have to dip something into it. You won't enjoy it if you stick a spoonful of it in your mouth, but mixed with fruit or other flavors, it adds a pleasant chocolatey taste. Most people I've given it to have enjoyed it and a few have hated it; it may be one of those things like grapefruit that you're either genetically able to tolerate or not."
4,Good Tasting Dip - Recommended,"The Walden Farms Chocolate Dip was a good find for me, but perhaps calling this ""Chocolate"" was a mistake since it only slightly resembles chocolate by looks and taste. It should be treated as a dessert dip/topping for dieters or diabetics. Being a Type 2 diabetic, I am always looking for low carb sweets that will not impact my blood sugar levels and this Dip/Topping has no impact at all.I like the flavor and use it to augment fruits and other sugar free foods to round out the dish. This works well with strawberries and with peanut butter.Recommended, if you set your expectations to match the reality that this is not really chocolate.

1,A Mere Parlor Trick,"Inconsistency can be found in the Bible (on almost every page), the writings of Thomas jefferson, the deeds of Ronald Reagan. This book purports to find incosistency (propogandized into hypocrisy in the usual rightwing polemic way) among liberals. Well it's true. That does happen. And in the same day George Bush can prodly announce to the world ""We do not use torture."" and threaten to veto a bill that would prohibit torture.It escapes me why the rightwing needs a constant dose of half-truths to keep its emotional high. Indeed, emotionalism is what the rightwing has descended to. The genuine heroes of conservatism: Irving Kristol, Richard Posner and the like are discarded in favor of an ideology whose adherents favor idology over country.Fanatacism reaps its own rewards -- a whirlwind."
1,This joker is a moron!,"This book comprises the moral soundness of a goat in heat. If you enjoy a good ""false dilemma,"" then this book is for you. Schweizer is a generously inarctiulate idiot who has all of the sensational semantic prowess that you see in this ad hominem attack. I highly advise you to stick with someone who ranks higher on the logic ladder. Don't waste your money!"
1,Why do people attack other people...,"instead of having a healthy discussion of ideas? Just because some people who subscribe to certain ideals and politics are imperfect and perhaps hypocrites does not mean that their ideas and politics are themselves bad. God has chosen many imperfect people to carry out his plans. He had no choice, there being no pool of perfect people to choose from, save Jesus. Oh, yeah, Jesus saves! Perhaps if we all try to love one another instead of attacking each other, things would improve. If you must, attack ideas, not people!"
5,Brilliant book!,"Too bad the MSM does not point out the obvious hypocrisy's about these ""stars"" when sticking a microphone in their face to get opinions of world views.....it is very easy to say the way you want things should be; it is another thing completely to live that way. This book is complete genius, pointing out today's ""practice what I preach...not what I practice"" liberal movement!"
4,Peter Schweizer-Do As I Say...,"The book was easy to read with many, but not all, facts that I had known previously about the liberals in his book. It was interesting to read about facts that were new, but not surprising about these hypocrites. I would recommend the book to others."
2,Message gets lost in a snooze-fest presentation,"I was looking for such an item, and thought I'd found it with this one, but it's disappointing beyond belief. The sincerity of the author cannot be denied. However, he must not think much of his audience, as the repetition, self-righteousness, and the overall pedestrian presentation just undermines it. Sad. I give it two stars not because it deserves it (because it doesn't), but rather for the intent rather than the result."
1,Stupid Book for Stupid People,"As they say, there is a sucker born every minute so it only makes sense that they would like this book. It gives them support for their believe that liberals are not ""good"" even if what they are accused of is totally prevalent in the conservative party. The hypocracy that we should be worried about are by those politicians that harm society as they profess their ""conservative values"", not whether someone has stocks or an SUV. Stupid priorities!"
1,Self evidently pointless,"I read this book, but you don't have to bother. After I read it, I thought, ""So what?"" How can a person's ideas have anything to do with their life style? If anything, it makes a convincing case for the ""Liberal"" POV. ""This guy is rich, so his liberalism is not veiled self-interest. He supports ideas which will harm him financialy."" If someone pointed out that a conservative was rich, you could accurately say that his ideas are motivated by self interest. A candidate for stupidest book of the year."
1,For people who want to avoid reality.,"The Reed review is right, this Hoover ""fellow"", a corporate intel operative, is basically providing ad hominem ammo for bloggers who want to duck the responsibility that comes with the facts that Franken, Nader and Chomsky reveal. Regarding Chomsky receiving military grants, that's hardly surprising and is something that Chomsky has pointed out himself on several occasions. The massive state directed sector of our economy is largely funded by research money provided via the Pentagon and agencies like DARPA which established the internet. Fortunately, Chomsky put his funds to constructive uses, not shameful uses like developing depleted uranium ordnance.People who like this book must be wanting to be deceived. Probably because they're wedded to the money and the mythology of empire. The way some are needing to wish away what Moore, West, Franken and others have to say is kind of sad. So much fear, so much self-imposed mental slavery."
1,All bashing and no play makes this book a dull one.,Nice to criticize liberals but offers the reader no real ammunition to defeat the system. I guess he forgot to mention that conservatives are far bigger liars and hypocrites but this kind of trash is what you'd expect from a Reagan hack !
4,Full Disclosure,A very quick read with a powerful impact. The short passages on each prominent liberal are loaded with documented examples of the concentrated hypocrisy inherent within the anti - Bush community.
4,Thank You,"This book should be required reading in every high school across the country.This book uses FACTS to offset the empty rhetoric spewed forth from the political figures of the left.Please America, try reading something like this before watching another docu-drama passed off as a documentary.Why only 4 stars? Because it was too short. I wanted the author to expose more hypocrites before I was finished."
4,Could be five stars,"I'm giving this book 4 stars as I believe it could have been a little better. It was fascinating reading about so many of the things I thought might be true, and now I know they are. The simplest example to explain the premise of the book would be the Rush Limbaugh/Doctor Shopping fiasco. When the left found out that Mr. Limbaugh had a drug problem and goes to treatment, they laugh, scream for investigations into illegal doctor shopping and basically trounce all over him. If someone on the left has the same problem, they are in need of compassion, help and are wonderful for admitting their problem. Double standard? You bet. This book just shows about 1,000 other examples."
3,good review on NRO,"I have not read it yet, but if you prefer a review written in a tone other than the thrid grade, take-my-ball-and-go-home style of the Publishers Review, I would suggest National Review Online. NRO points out some very interesting items: Such as Ralph Nader and Nancy Pelosi and their aversion to unionized labor in their businesses, Noam Chomsky and Mikey Moore getting rich of off that nasty capitalism, even (gasp) the military-industrial complex, and so forth...I look forward to reading it."
1,Hypocrisy?,"Liberals are the hypocrits?No mention of George W. Bush's military desertion... cocaine charges... DUI's... life-long alcoholism... ???Oh, that's right. His very rich, very powerful, well-connected daddy got all that expunged from the public record.Liberals are the hypocrits?"
4,"Well written, subject matter a bit dull.","I like Schweizer's work - especially ""Victory."" The book is well written, and it provides good ""ammunition"" for you whenever one of your lefty friends talks about Chomsky or Moore. I find celebrity lefties a bit irritating, but it was interesting to find out that they are not as idiotic in their personal lives as they seem to be in their public lives."
1,Mean spirited drivel,"This book is hypocritical, selective, myopic and in many cases, downright wrong.Wow, Michael Moore is actually making a profit. Last time I checked, that was part of the American dream.Red meat for unthinking Right Wingnuts. Go ahead, waste your money."
1,"Just partisan rightwing red meat. Doesn't explain ""conservatives"" and their obvious hypocrisies","That's fine if Peter wants to expose bad ""liberals"" for not following their own rules but this kind of rightwing red meat fodder only serves to further pit us working class against one another and further divide America to the point of total collapse. Do yourselves a favor and please get a book that exposes the inconsistencies of both the ""liberals"" and the ""conservatives"" rather than one or the other. Also, notice that this same author is none more than a Reagan/Weinberger SOCKPUPPET given his partisan rightwing rants on defending Reagan."
1,what a joke,"I love how conservatives believe that EVERYTHING they do is great, and EVERYTHING liberals do is terrible. Please, tell me how great the war in Iraq is. Tell me where the WMDs are. Tell me how safe we are now. Tell me what a great country we live in when we ""elect"" leaders based on issues like gay rights and guns, and not on education and the economy. Tell me why the rest of the world hates our guts. Oh, I know...it's all the liberals' fault! What an idiot."
1,$11.62 to learn this?!,"Well, researched? Yes. Sure. For that it gets one star. However, the statement, ""when conservatives betray their publicly stated principles, they harm only themselves and their families,"" loses it four stars. This is naive and dangerous. The bipartisan Select Committee on Intelligence and Iraq Survey Group have proven that the publicly stated principles of the conservatives running the current administration are the reason for the 2,942 dead Americans and 48,880 wounded Americans in Iraq, as well as the fact that America's safety, freedoms and economic strengths have been compromised. Yes, Liberals and Conservatives can be hypocrites. I don't need to spend $11.62 to tell me that. However, when conservatives betray their publicly stated principles, they can do a lot more than harming themselves and their families. I would rather this book put petty hypocrisy into perspective."
1,"Poorly written, for people with poorly working minds.","""Extremely well-researched and documented"". Ha, not really. Most of the damning ""hypocricies"" in this book have been pointed out by the left about others in their movement (sometimes by the folks themselves as in Chomsky's case), so I don't know where this guy gets off acting like a researcher.Even if all the ""facts"" in this book were true, and few are without a streching them three miles long, I don't understand were conservatives get off calling the kettle black."
5,Liberals are from the shallow end of the gene pool,"Usually both physically and mentally, and they know it."
3,THROW THEM ALL OUT,Proves Democrats are just like Republicans. Schweizer's new book is aptly titled. We should throw them ALL out. I believe Schwizer has perform much more research and has become better educated on just how hypocritical our politicians and those who support them have become. Liberalism/Conservatism? We're all just trying to make a buck.The current flavor (tea party) are proving to be just as hypocritical and not living their message!
4,Somewhat subdued!,"I found the book to be very readable, and while some points were slightly belabored, it wasn't either boring or over the top. I'm sure the same hyprocrisy could be summaried for many of the ""other side of the isle"", but all-in-all, pretty subdued and still entertaining with the appearance of being even handed. And I was impressed with some of the research the author did, particularly in relationship to stock ownership."
5,So true.....,"I find it odd that a Dummycrat can state lies and hyperbole with no statistical back up and half the country believes them. When a Republican/Conservative states facts, with all kinds of research data, they are called liars. This book certainly points out all kinds of hypocrisy on the left, WITH documented proof. I certainly liked the book, would highly recommend it to anyone that can actually think. The title tells it all, too bad the people covered in it have no shame. Two faced, split tongue, talking out of both sides of their mouths, such are just some of the problems of the elite left."
5,I couldn't put it down!,"I have to say, I love books that expose hypocrisy, and this truly does. I don't care if you campaign for your beliefs because you truly believe them, but don't try to legislate me to do one thing and do something different yourself! This was a real eye-opener; even introduced some infamous ones I didn't know previously! Definitely recommended reading."
5,Great Book,"Read this book several years ago. I still reference it today. It is too bad that they libs don't see it the same way we do, as Michael Moore lives in a million dollar plus home. Great book."
1,Blatant Falsehoods,"Extended research shows that most of the contentions in this rag are completely false, much like when Ann Coulter claimed the New York Times did not cover the crash of Dale Earnhardt. This will matter little to the blowhards and slack jawed inbreds who swallow this drivel hook, line and sinker. Schweizer is obviously a professional failure who is attempting to cash in on the industry of feeding propaganda to the stupid. He must have gotten this idea from the laughably false Fox News."
4,Case Studies in Liberal Hypocrisy,"Author Peter Schweitzer has written a devastating series of case studies in liberal hypocrisy. Many if not most liberal icons - Al Franken, Ted Kennedy, Hillary, etc. - are exposed and skewered due to the incongruity between their public pronouncements and their own lifestyles.If you view yourself as a conservative, you will likely love this book. Otherwise, there is a good chance that you would not even pick it up.The only thing missing is a chapter on (""Carbon Footprint"") Al Gore and his year-round heated swimming pool. (Maybe in the next edition??)Dip in and enjoy ... if you dare!"
4,Moral Certitude or Not?,"It's always amusing when self-righteous hypocrites are exposed for being exactly that. The Religious Right has taken a pounding from liberals for the sins of Jimmy Swaggart, Jim Bakker, and Ted Haggard. The problem is, when you condemn someone for their actions, you shouldn't be doing those same things yourself. That makes you a hypocrite.Schweitzer's book exposes the hypocrisy of self-described liberals such as Michael Moore, Barbra Streisand, Nancy Pelosi, Al Franken, Noam Chomsky and, of course, Hillary Clinton. The information he includes regarding Whitewater was eye-opening and I'm glad I never voted for either of them in any election. At the very least, Swaggart and Bakker admitted that what they did was wrong, while liberals like Chomsky simply change the subject.If the liberals expect to be taken seriously by the voting public, then they need to practice what they preach."
5,great book,"A thoroughly researched book that backs up claims with facts. It shines the light of truth on liberals, who want you to live a certain way, while they do whatever they want, above scrutiny, above the law, and above you."
5,Excellent documentation of hypocrisy,They all preach ideas derived from the likes of Karl Marx to the masses but in private act according to the teachings of Adam Smith. These capitalists get richer and richer and pretend they don't like the system. It is amazing that so many people are fooled and thus don't strive to make a bundle themselves.
5,Hypocrites cry foul,"The one star reviews are without substance but engage in demogoguery. One reviewer makes the absurd arguemnt that liberals discus issues but conservatives attack people. Then in the next breath calls the author an ""ultra-right-wing-radical-neoconservative Reagan sycophant."" The truth is the left takes a back seat to no one when it comes to character attacks. Since they are devoid of ideas that is all they have left.This funny book documnets the rank hypocracy of the lunatic left."
5,Accipe illud from the right.,"A fast, amusing read that exposes a list of high-profile liberals as hypocrites profiting mightily from the capitalist system living lives of luxury and fame while preaching a liberal philosophy and pretending to be ""just one of the folks."" Also, exposes rather significant misstatements of fact made some liberals. An example are factual errors in Al Franken's ""Lying Liars..""The book does not attack liberal philosophy but the human, oh so human, frailties of certain liberals.The book is a timely reminder of things we all know intuitively, but would like to forget: that most politicians and their hangers on (commentators, social activists, etc. etc.) are trying to profit personally by the acquisition of money or political power that can be converted to money's worth and that their espoused philosophies are often just rhetoric used to solicit votes from an unwitting electorate.The first review was right. This should be a good reference for bloggers."
5,Exposing the truth of liberal hypocrisy,Schweizer exposes how those on the left who crow the loudest do so (one might surmise) because they are trying to convince themselves.
1,More right wing propaganda by sub-intelligent dishonest author,"Schweizer puts forth ad hominem attacks, fallacious arguments, and borderline libelous assertions and calls them fact. Only the most uneducated, non-thinking, brainwashed person would believe anything in this book.Really, ""yawn,"" boring, more hatred spouted by a right wing that is losing their absolute power as the American people are realizing that when you don't put any money into government, you DO NOT have any services!!! Hey, love losing the mortgage deductions, no, Republicans??? HaHa!! Great government we have!Thank God I borrowed it and didn't waste my money on it - sigh of relief."
1,Look in the Mirror,"This is a great example of how Republicans first attack the person's looks and intelligence, then make fun of their position, manipulate the truth and finally try to destroy how their target makes a living. This book epitomizes the hypocrisy of the Republican party as they have done the exact same things they claim these Democrats have and much worse. Republicans who are blinded by 9/11 will love this book as it feeds into the uninformed fools who follow the current neo-con agenda. Congratulations to Peter Schweizer for capitalizing on the uninformed!"
3,Comments,"I have reviewed ""No global warming..No Santa"" comments on this and his other 11 comments. He/She is unlikely to have read this or any of the others in which he/she simply insults anything critical of liberals. The reviews are essentially the same. Just read them. They have no basis. I will vote independent because the Republicans are too much like the Democrats these days. The popular thing to do is not necessarily the right thing to do. Both parties have forgotten that. At least the right wing tried a bit longer."
1,Missed the most glaring hypocrisy of all....,"I guess the author forgot to mention how wars to spread ""freedom"" are in large part financed by the Chinese buying T-bills. Oh, and the Chinese are Communist in case Mr Bush forgot. Use Red money to fight those undemocratic Muslims... now thats principle!For a more balanced look at the problems in the country, Republican and Democratic alike, check out the new book ""Empire of Debt."""
4,The book title says it all,"Sure the book is one sided- but the title says it all ""Profiles in LIBERAL hypocrisy"". This isn't a book looking at both sides of the political spectrum- it focuses on surprisingly enough, several prominent liberals. It also a look at their hypocrisy and nicely details said hypocrisy. So if you are looking for a book exposing Liberal hypocrits, this book delivers."
5,Kendra (The Girl Next Door),"Short and simple if you like ""The Girls Next Door."" You will love this show. I watched this on E! with my wife and we both enjoyed it. Hilarious first season, what will Kendra get into next? I definitely recommend this!"
4,It's... Kendra!,"If you are checking this out, you probably loved the Girls Next Door. Kendra is the youngest of the blond threesome, and Kendra is the first season of the reality show about her life - but you probably already knew that.The show takes us through Kendra moving into her new home, moving in with her fiance, breaking the news of her pregnancy to an unhappy mother and the challenges and humor of life after the Playboy Mansion.If you liked the Girls Next Door you will like this. It has cameo's of Bridget and Holly and it is full of those situations, girls and experiences that made the Girls Next Door so much fun. For me, the hole left by Holly and Bridget is noticeable but the show manages to be fun without them.I wish that this DVD release had more special features - in a world where you can download any TV show, there needs to be motivation to actually purchase the DVD - it is uncensored and includes the extra re-cap episode, but little else by way of features."
1,wack azz show,hank is a fool for marrying kendra she's a former ex prostitute who did orgies with her sugardaddy hugh hefner plus on some old pimp chit kendra took hank to meet her ex who does that betcha iceberg slim is laughing at hank right now then she invited too short to her house why hank is a fool looks like kendra is still up to her tricks plus she's bisexual isn't that why hank married her this is why their marriage is about to be over.
3,"""Life Styles of the Rich and Famous""","Since more than half the book describes the life styles of the rich and famous with homes in Newport, and in Manhattan, parties, jets, and trips most of us can only fantasize about, the book reminded me of that television show. After 200 pages, did you finally get a glimpse into any action with the attack on Nicole. Then it took another 100 pages before a murder. The book coasted along with more promises but when the book picks up, it picked up with at least to me a shocking ending.Her characters are well developed, enough action to keep you reading.This was my first book by this author.I may try her again but you understand...So many books, so little time!"
4,"enjoyed the videos, not enough of them for the price","enjoyed the videos, not enough of them for the price.Well that's my opinion. The kids like the videos though."
1,Tiny thing ruins it,"A clever idea, would be great if the frog wasn't flashing his genitals all over the place. What's the point? Childish & stupid."
3,Jovanotti is great,"Jovanotti is great, but his last albums have another wave. The old one is more happy..."
5,Forget the Original Version. Get the Extended.,"The Extended edition of each movie is a lot better than the original one. Many questions that the original films left are answered in the extended ones. Many characters that seem shallow are revealed more in-depth. The Two Towers is the textbook definition of ""The Middle Movie."" Do not watch it without seeing the first and do not watch the third without seeing the second. It's too confusing otherwise."
1,Not the described product.,The disk case says it's a two disk set including the feature film and the special effects. Inside there is only the special effects. Very frustrating. Very Displeased. The disk case is also flimsy. The plastic on the back of the case is dented/creased.
4,Better Than the Book,"Evan though I have always loved reading, including fantasy, I had a terrible time reading the Lord Of the Ring series. Never did finish it, but the movie is wonderful, holds your attention. The photography is wonderful. the characters are so believable, and I find everyone one in our family that has seen it loved it. From the grandmother to the 7 year old grandson, and every age group in between. Wish we had more like this."
5,Better Than I Expected,"'The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers' is a movie I thought would be good or possibly average when I saw the first preview of it. But I was totally wrong. I thought 'The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers' was a brilliant movie when I saw it in theaters! In fact it was even better than its great prequel 'The Fellowship of the Ring'. The action, adventure, musical (score), acting, and drama 'The Two Towers' had to offer was incredible! Both 'Fellowship of the Ring' and 'Two Towers' went buy 'The Lord of the Rings' book trilogy very well even though there were some parts that HAD to be added, cut, or changed. So far 'The Lord of the Rings' movie trilogy is going by very well! I can't wait to see 'Lord of the Rings: Return of the King' which I'm sure will be a great adaptation of 'The Lord of the Rings' book trilogy like its two prequels are. For now I must torturingly wait for 'The Two Towers' DVD to be released in stores."
3,Wait untl the Extended Edition comes out,"I echo moviemaus-- rent if you want to watch it. Even the description above says it includes# An inside look at the Special Extended DVD Edition of ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"".That is the multi-DVD set with deleted scenes that Tolkien fans like me missed in LOTR. Don't make the same mistake I did with LOTR!"
5,one of the best movies i have ever seen,"This is by far one of the best movies I have ever seen. The action, the story, everything about this movie is perfect. This movie makes me want to actually pick up the book and start reading. The casting, the effects, the costumes, Gollum, all excellent work. The Battle of Helms Deep was the best medieval type action sequence I have ever seen. After seeing this and The Fellowship, I can only imagine what the Return of the King holds in store. I also hope that in a few years they might decide to make a prequel to it with the Hobbit. In all i would definitley reccomend this to people of all ages."
1,NOT EXTENDED EDITIONS,"This product is not actually the extended edition as Amazon lists it as in its own review of the product...the information in the ""WHAT YOU GET.."" section of the review is not correct, this is a 1 sided blu ray of the THEATRICAL cut of the film. This is still an excellent film...just not the product advertised. I'm having to return all 3 of these movies now for the correct products...FIX THIS AMAZON!!!"
5,The Two Towers Does NOT Dissapoint!,"I can't believe that there are actually negative reviews about this wonderful movie sequel. ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" is a movie that inspired me to like fantasy."
3,"Like the first one, great effects, meaningless story...","as usual, great visual effects, great sets, wonderful cast but the story runs so fast that we place ourselves on 10 or 20 different places on the 1rst half hour! like the first movie of the trilogy I think the two towers is very resumed so it can fit on 3 hours! there are ridiculous scenes too, like the final battle...how the hell is possible to beat up that monstrous army!?!? and how about those anoying trees that made everybody on the theater sleepy? Like the matrix reloaded..a deception with 5 star visual effects (like all movies nowadays)"
4,The two towers,The movie was great but the picture was fuzzy or blurry and it made it difficult to finish the movie.
1,Misrepresented. Not the Extended Version,"This is not the extended version as stated in the blurb. It is very disappointing to me, as I have seen the extended version on DVD. Amazon needs to be more careful in matching descriptions to the project. The fact that comments on a product are shared across different version of the same title, makes it very confusing."
1,A box full of rocks.,"New and out of the shrink wrap my DVDs won't play. I wonder how many people are getting rooked. For the price they charged you'd think they could at least put working DVDs in those pretty cases!!PS: I have multiple DVD players in perfect condition. I play hundreds of DVDs (and keep all of them scratch free), when I say they are defective it is because they are."
1,Purists are outraged,"Purists feel Jackson departs from the book. However, if the viewer is a casual fan, does it really matter? In my opinion, ""Yes"". It's not the same experience!Some may see the movie and be inspired to pick up the books. In doing so, that person may sorely disappointed when the find out about the following inconsistencies:In the book, Gollum leads the nice hobbitsies deep into Mordor.In the movie, Gollum only approaches Mordor.Book: Boromir's ghost comes to Frodo in a dream.Movie: Boromir steals the ring from Frodo causing him to fall into a dream-like state.Book: Samwise and Gollum share an intimate moment during a very passionate male on male kiss.Movie: Gollum forces himself into Samwise after tricking Samwise to take a strange root known as ""Spanish-fly""Book: Gandalf and Treebeard engage in an arm wrestling contest.Movie: Gandalf slices through Mirkwood using a lightsaber?! Come-on Peter Jackson, what are you thinking?!"
1,The Two Whaters,just showing beautiful landscapes and having a powerful small item like a ring does not a trilogy make.
1,Just what we need!,An even longer version of a movie that was too long to begin with! The other version gets three stars because you can almost get through it before you die of old age.
2,"loved the book, skip this 1/3 of the movie","We saw part I and the weak ending and hoped part II wouldbe better. But like part I, this movie was high on commercialselling, high on computer graphics, and drawn out on meaninglessdramatic scenes. Granted a foreign film may not have thesatisfaction of a worthy character-driven script. But it isnot a credit to the book....Sure has some interesting scenery though."
1,Close enough is not good enough,"Dear readers,For those of you that decided that the two towers was a worth while movie I feel an overwhelming sadness for you. I have read the reviews from those that thought that it was a good movie and all I can say is if JRR meant for Aragorn to fall over a cliff,he would have writen it. I won't bore you with the rantings of a Tolkien aphile and other glaring omitions and additions,those of you who know, know what they are. However when Mr Jackson adds to the story it makes me see red. I find it hard to write this because its all been said before,while it is true that it is impracticle to follow the book word for word, would it have been to much to ask that he get right what he filmed. For those who know maintain the rage because we know that beauty is in the details and for the others, read the book so you too can tell the difference."
1,Appendices Won't Play,"I have bought two of these at Wal-mart and neither one of them has appendices that will play. The problem is, Wal-mart will not give me my money back-only replacements. How may times will I have to return this piece of worthless junk? Am I the only one who's had this problem?"
1,"""The Lord of Boredom""- A supreme dissapointment.","Exciting? Definiately not! This movie makes abseloutely no scense whatsoever, and you would think the action would make you on the edge of your seat every time. Rong. Instead you get an overated, 3hr. long, compromising ..., repetative actions scenes that are suppose to resemble a movie. The actors are dismal with little acting experience, all the action reigns way to long, and talking trees?- Thats just crazy. All in all, I do not recommend this subpar ""thriller""."
1,"""Braveheart"" with Elves","I have actually seen this film and it was very disappointing. While it is without a doubt some of the best cinematography ever, it was really nothing more than a war film and basically ""Braveheart"" with elves. It is 100% unadulterated testosterone. The two female characters in the film are ""fluff"" and do exactly as they are told. Not to mention that I had a huge cramp in my back after sitting watching battle scene after battle scene for three hours. To the other reviewers, no one cares whether you liked the trailer or not, that's the gimmick to get you to spend your money on the film. Don't you get it? It's an advertisement and those are always suppose to make the product look good even if it is a piece of trash. Save your money and peace of mind this holiday season and see a film that doesn't cater to war mongers."
1,Not all that good.,"I'll be fairly straight here...This movie is the worst or the 3. Only see it to get the basic picture of what happens between the 1st and 3rd movies. It is dreary, unimaginative and badly filmed. All the actors have gone weird and tried to make the movie their own, while all failing. It has no scenes that give you a real feeling of the trilogy and the scenes themselves do nothing but explain, or repeat, what's happening.Do not bother buying it unless you're one of those nuts who has to have the whole series, no matter what. The other two are great, however."
5,wonderful movie,"I really enjoyed this movie,and the sets and makeup were outstanding and so were the actors. well worth the money I got the trilogy of this movie"
1,The package,"Did not come with the DVD. I received it on time, but I have no idea why the DVD was not included. Obviously, this is an issue"
3,The case was pretty roughed up...,"I recently purchased all 3 of the LOTR movies from this website. When they arrived and I unwrapped them I found that this one's case was in really bad shape. There were dozens of dents and even a rip through the plastic and paper of the cover. It reminded me of a very used and uncared for DVD. The Two Towers came sandwiched between the first and third movie (which were both in pristine, flawless condition), so I know for sure that its condition was NOT a product of poorly handled shipping. Luckily, the discs were undamaged."
2,I am cheated!!!,"First of all, the aspect ratio is stated as 1.77:1 in Product Details section. The aspect is not 1.77:1, but 2.40:1. Secondly, it is written in Editorial Reviews section that theatrical version is applicable. However, there is not theatrical version in any of the discs.I do not understand how Amazon permits this kind of goods sold on its web-site!!!"
5,Wow and oh my god,never has a movie left with so excited. I could watch these forever.The action is great. you will realy feel for the characters. I never have cried so much in my entire life. Wow is all i can say. this movie is super intense
5,Yay!,Love Lord of the Rings. It's awesome that it's so convenient to rent movies now online and that the extended version of this movie is available.
5,The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers,"My husband just loves, loves, loves this movie. So glad I was able to find all three extended editions for him for Christmas. I'll be shopping here more often!"
4,Well said Neverwinter Knight!,"Give us a break! All you idiots who keep writing these one line reviews saying the movies are junk, just SHUT UP! If you used even half your brain you would see that they are good movies, or at least that posting one line criticizing them is dumber than the movies could ever be. If youre going to criticize a movie, at least give reasons, otherwise youll just prove that youre an idiot compared to those of us that actually give reasons for our opinions."
3,Choppy,"The movie continually paused to catch-up with the download for the first half hour. I have more than adequate internet, but still frustrating. Overall a good movie, though a lot more in the books!"
5,Even if you need antidepressants,John Fumunda you are in serious need of antidepressants! Help yourself before it's too late. This is an amazing milestone in movie making! How stupid can someone be???!
5,All that and MORE!!,"This Movie Is Just as good as the first movie.What happen is Saruman tries to take over the world and wipe human kind off the earth. But If love fighting this is a movie for you plus this movie is based around Aragorn,Gimili,Legolas."
5,"Excellent movie, but the DVD skipped!","I loved this movie, and when I ordered my DVD and it arrived , I was very excited to watch it. However, right after the climax (Helm's Deep, Ent attack), as Gandalf & company are looking towards Moror, the DVD skipped back to the beginning. Too bad I can't watch the ending. The only reaon I gave this 5 stars because the rest of the movie was so awesome. This is similar to another person who saig BOTH copies of the Two Towers they saw had the exact same problem!I just pray when I watch the Extended Edition, I will be able to watch the whole movie."
4,Good but may not be necessary,"There are quite a few more scenes in the extended edition, but they are just extended parts of other scenes for the most part. A lot of focus on Eowyn, some on Aragorn, a bit on Frodo and Sam (and Sam's rope), and some on Merry and Pippin with the Ents."
5,lord of rings,WOW! Daughter needed to replace VHS she borrowed from friend and I was completly happy.
3,"Lord of the Rings, The Two Towers","The CD's themselves worked, but the box case was worn and smelled like smoke. Overall, for 5 bucks it was a good deal though!"
5,just great but ...,"The only complaint I have about this DVD package is that unlike the Fellowship of the Rings box, the company decided to *glue* the ""features sheet"" to the back of the box! (sorry, I don't really know how to describe this sheet but when you see it, or own the Fellowship box, you will know what I mean). I ruined my box trying to the remove this sheet and the glue residue :-(."
1,Lord of the Rings- The two towers,I think the Lord of the Rings-Two Towers was wonderful. I think that the whole series was GREAT! You can't get more drama and action in one movie.
4,"Fabulous, Wondrous, Empty","If you attend a feast and find yourself at a table of wonderfully beautiful foods, heap your plate full, and eat the most savory delicious meal you've ever had in your life, amid all the sumptuous smells rising from that delectable table, but then find, after you've left the banquet, that for some inexplicable reason your stomach is growling with hunger, as if it were completely empty, then you'll understand the experience of seeing The Lord of The Rings."
2,Disappointing,"The package itself was not disappointing, the movie treatment of the book feel far short of my expectations."
1,"Thanks again, Peter, we knew we could count on you.","Like in my last review, I own two sets of LOTR, and I will not own a third one.Whilst I prefer theatrical versions, the extended versions of this are good. I also heard that the extended versions are split, and put onto two sides of a disc. That sucks, because as an owner of a 5-disc DVD player, I can just change the discs around with my remote easily.Thanks, but no thanks, Peter Jackson."
3,Beautiful but Disappointing,"I agree with the other reviewers that this is indeed a wonderful film, beautifully created with great acting. That said, it was quite disappointing in the many points where it diverged from the book. I'm not such a stickler that I can't handle a few differences -- I agreed with all of the changes made to Fellowship that were necessary to make the story flow on screen. But making Faramir a bad guy? And what's the deal with the wimpy Ents? Visually appealling, but an intellectual let down. I almost wish I didn't love the books so I could have enjoyed the movie. Almost, but not quite."
4,Just a little slow,"Good movie, a little slow in spots (too much running everywhere!), but great visuals as usual."
3,not great,"I was not all that impressed with this movie...after all the hype I expected more than just a bunch of people either getting ready for a battle, engaging in a battle or talking about what a heck of a big battle was next. I understand having the dwarf make a jerk out of himself for comedic effect was not in the books...(never read them...not my bag...) and that a whole bunch of other stuff was either made up or left out. That seems like a pretty lame way to make a movie of a classic novel...The beginning part where that guy...Merlin, I think, was falling and killing that thing from Spawn...that was pretty cool...and those trees (though they were kind of an HR Puffinstuf rip off)... three stars for all that and any other part that didn't remind me of Braveheart."
5,Amazing movie,"This is just a fantastic edition of such a wonderful movie. There's 4 discs, 2 for the movie itself and 2 for a staggering amount of bonus features. I highly recommend getting all 3 movies in the trilogy, especially in bluray. The extended edition adds a lot of run time, and makes the small extra cost well worth it."
3,well...,The first movie was great but this one was boring. Nothing at all happened during the neverending 3 hours. Maybe it was supposed to lack action...hopefully the last one would be better.
1,Horrible Quality RUINS great movie,Sound not on time with pictureSwitched into SD every 30 seconds.I Couldnt even watch it without restarting Amazon every minute.
1,Amazon is the WORST video service!!!,"I am currently an Amazon Prime customer! I am also subscribed to two other video services (Netflix and Hulu), and I find that on their best day Amazon falls far short in ALL categories. Since movies consist of images and sound, Amazon fails on both counts. I have actually tested the Amazon sound with an identical movie on Netflix, and can understand every word on the Netflix version with the volume set at less than half of what I tried to hear the dialogue with on the Amazon version. THIS movie will takes forever to load, even when NOT HD. I have never had a single problem loading High Definition movies with any other online service, but again Amazon seems to have a problem getting video to my home screen more often than not. Amazon is the absolute WORST online video service I have experienced so far, and you can be sure they won't ""burn"" me in any more purchases from them!!"
3,The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (Four-Disc Special Extended Edition),The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (Four-Disc Special Extended Edition) is the second movie in the Lord of Rings trilogy. This is Peter Jackson's reading of the book as much is changed from the book. Much has been changed and and much of the changes have unfortunately completely changed the storyline. The music is grand and the acting is quite good. The special effects that were good at the time can seem a bit dated at times. One must remember that 10 years have past and that special effects are much more advanced now compared to then. Some of the comic relief moments detract from the serious nature of the book and are frankly a bit annoying. Still and all a quite good movie. I give it a strong 3. 3/5.
3,Great day for movies....,"For those of you who have never read LOTR, then I promise you will enjoy this movie --- depending on your attention span, that is. It is rather long. However, the special effects do not take away from the great acting, especially from Ellijah Wood and Sean Astin.For those of you who have read LOTR and have not seen the movie, prepare to be disappointed. Jackson's treatment of Farimir and Theoden left much to be desired since their characters were completely changed --- what happened to Farimir in the movie might make you cry. Expect other changes you will find surprising since they came from ""lovers"" of Tolkien's masterpiece (i.e. Peter Jackson, Christopher Lee [who reads the story every year] and others)."
4,Movie vs. Book,"Great Film! First the good news. Great acting, action, cinematography. The attention to detail is mind boggling. The great quandry of an epic film is to sacrifice acting for effects. Jackson has held true to the characters as well as the main story. Of course a few of Tolkiens subplots are sacrificed but not out of disrespect. They simply would not help the film. For all you Tolkien purists...you just need to b**ch about something! The truth is that you'll be closet fans of the films right to your graves.Now the bad news. Jackson has missed with the Nazgul (ringwraiths). The films simply do not convey what powerful and menacing creatures they are in the books. Their very presence sapps the presence of being from any mortal within proximity. The film does not make the viewer fear them. Remember how you felt watching The Shining or The Excorcist?Can't wait for ROTK."
1,"To tell you the truth, the movie is just boring!!!!","I dont see peaple like this movie, I saw it the other day and it was just boring!!!!"
2,"Buy Platinum Series Extended Edition, because","I bought Platinum Series Extended Edition Fellowship Of The Ring. The movie is longer. The extra scenes are very helpful to understand the movie, and of course they are wonderful."
5,One of the Gratest Movies of are time!,This is a superb movie! I have the Fellowship of the Ring Speical Edition and its great. It is a little expensive but for die hard Lord of the Rings fans its great. Its good for the hole family. There a lot of speical Features that I all so like watching. Hope I wasn't to Bies.
4,Better than the first,"I am not a big fan of this movie yet?However I felt that The Two Tower's was betterthan the first Lord of the ring's.The one thing I didn't care for was the creaturecalled Gollum.He reminded me too much of Jar Jar Bink'sin Star wars episode 1:The Phantom menace(Very annoying).Overall this is a very good movie for thoseof you who like action,drama and suspense.A must own for every die hard Lord of the ring's fan."
3,If only they had stuck with the book,"I have been a dedicated Tolkien-lover since I first read ""The Hobbit"" and ""The Lord of the Rings"" at the age of ten. I believe that the film version of ""The Two Towers"" would have been greatly strengthened had they merely followed the book. I am most disappointed with the movie's portrayal of Faramir, Captain of Gondor. In the movie, he is presented as a heartless villain with a mind only for power and self-service. This is entirely contrary to the Faramir that Tolkien so carefully created. Faramir, the unloved son of Denethor, is the antithesis of his brother Boromir whose lust for the Ring led to an untimely death in ""The Fellowship of the Ring"". Faramir's character is noble and wise, an essential facet of the story that is misrepresented in the movie ""The Two Towers"". However, my various disappointments will not keep me from purchasing the extended edition of ""The Two Towers"", or awaiting December 17, 2003 with any less fervor."
3,Overlong....,"...but definitely better than Part 1. I enjoyed this one a lot!!! Thank goodness Chicago won Best Picture though, otherwise I was going to be upset."
2,Just didn't do anything for me,"You know, I really loved The Lord of the Rings, and thought the animation and special effects enhanced the storytelling in a truly amazing way. But for me, the special effects, animation, and computer manipulations took center stage to story telling in The Twin Towers and (the retelling of) the story suffered from a lack of imagination. After awhile, it was just one battle scene after another until I really didn't care any more."
3,"Like the 1st better,haft to be big fan to really enjoy !","So long!!!! yes. I enjoyed the first one better because it had more adventure to it a little less talk. If you must a very big fan to enjoy the entire 3 hours and 10 min of it, I admit after the first hour I was bored out of my mind. But in a ""planned"" Triligy the 2nd movie always seems to be the settig for the 3rd which useally like in this movie has a lot of taking and setting up. If you gunna go see it I suggest takeing a neck pillow with you and be pre-bared to sit there for a long while, if you have read the book or really enjoy it may seem like 45 min to you if you havent it will seem like 11 hours (no joke).But now to complamit it, I was blown away by the battel seqences so well done I couldent beleve it thats what made it intresting to me and I look foward to Lord of The Rings IIIBut be pre-pared I hered the 3rd and final installment is going to be about 3 hours and 45 min."
5,A True Masterpiece,"I'll keep this brief: FIRST - this film is a wonderful ADAPTATION (for all you whining purist freaks out there) of a great literary creation. The changes are compelling and add to the story. If you don't like a decision Peter Jackson made merely because it is different then what Tolkien wrote (regardless of whether it makes sense, or adds tension, or character development etc.) then you are a fool. The LOTR is a story, a piece of art, a hobby, or even a passion; but NOT A RELIGION. Wake up.SECOND - to the reviewer (oceanaut1) who mentioned that Jackson made a mistake because Frodo showed the Ring to the Nazgul - you are wrong and an idiot. The Nazgul are basically blind - they could only pinpoint the ring if Frodo wore it; which is why Sam stopped him. At least do your research before complaining."
5,A BRAVO FOR THE TRILOGY & 3 SOUNDTRACKS,"""I regret to announce that this is the end. I'm going now, I bid you all..."" the best. I sure will miss the rush of expecting more from the LOTR cast, after this, there's no more. I love everything involved with the movie and since I'm a composer (film score composer wanna be someday) I will miss waiting for the december to come...after this, the coming christmas won't be the same. I wish these movies will go on forever, but all WE have to decide is what to do with the experience that the producer and the cast left us with. To me, this has been the best cinematic experience of my life. These movied changed my life and I hope in the years to come anybody who watches the movie will still admire the great talent and work of the whole cast. enough said! 11/25/2003"
3,Good But Not Great - Dark...,"There are already myriad reviews of this film, but I'll add my $.02 - if we're just talking about the merits of the film, it was pretty good but can in no way compare to the detail and depth of the original Tolkein works. It was darker in many places than the first film, if that's possible. But if you've not read the books it gives you a decent overview of the events the contained in the book. I'd recommend getting the books and the movies and do your own comparison."
4,"Great movie, less than perfect adaptation","I was very impressed with the movie production. The sets, costumes, acting, special effect were all spectacular. However, they strayed too far from Tolkein's original story. Although better than most movie adaptations, Jackson fell into the trap of trying to change the book to make it more interesting to less sophisticated movie goers. He needs to give regular viewers more credit, and realize that it is the hard-core fans of the books, the ones that have been following the making of the movie for years, that are going to keep it successful. There is nothing wrong with the original story, and modifying it only lessens it's impact. All that aside, the movie was very well done and very entertaining. The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is the differences from the original."
5,Better than the First!,"The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is an outstanding fantasy/action/adventure film about Frodo and Sam heading out to Mordor alone, while Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli must fight in the Battle of Helm's Deep.It has an amazing cast including Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, Viggo Mortensen, Bernard Hill, Miranda Otto, and many more!"
4,Disc 2 was defective,"Excellent extra footage, but Disc 2 was defective. The Helms Deep scene did not play properly. I exchanged it for another one, and it was also defective. The Helms Deep scene played correctly, but I was not able to select the scene from the menu. Is anyone else getting this problem?"
5,One of the best movie sets ever,"The Lord of the Rings trilogy is an excellent movie series. If you have read the books you can appreciate this movies battle scenes as they show a more in depth experience you cannot attain through the books. not to mention the amazing cinematography! the greatest film angles ever. You can realy feel the emotions of the actors, they show a great view of the characters. BUY TODAY i reccoment greatly"
4,Peter Jackson=Schmuck. Movie=Good.,"Any LOTR fan who has read the book and expected the movie to be a near seamless adaptaion of the book is extremely heartbroken as am I. Everyone who has given it a negative rating knows this, but it is kind of unfair to do that to the movie. The movie was indeed an excellent movie. Despite the fact that I want to personally remove Peter Jacksons genetilia and digest them and feed him my excrements.The movie was excellent. Once I forced myself to forget that I had read the book I realized the movie was still very good. Although I refused to forgive pj's for sacriglegiously marring the charecter of Faramir. I'm praying this Aussie schvatza doesn't do the same to the ROTK. All fans of the book know to hate the director. But, don't hate the movie. The movie has excellent musical score, unprecendented scenery and prop use, and extraordinary charecter development. There's nothing more you can ask for in a good movie. Just, if you need to vent, send pj's a bomb."
3,huray for hollywood,Thank you so very much Mr. jackson for covoluting a wonderful piece of litterary work. You have shown us yet again (ie. The Fellowship of the Ring) that you are indeed hollywood's best friend. Have fun on your shire hill of money (traitor).............
2,Two Towers very dissapointing,"I thought Peter Jackson did a phenominal job bringing Fellowship to the screen, but failed with this one.Gollum was great, and exceeded my expectations. What was up with Faramir? If it was not for the fact that Jackson made him a completely unsympathetic Boramir clone, I would have given this 4 stars."
1,Fix the frickin case!,"I love the Lord of the Rings extended edition DVDs so much; but I often wonder if the wonder of the extended editions are half in the cases that hold them: Amazing leather textures, beautiful artwork, and symbols from Tolkien. But this new one. Is cheep milk carton paper. I baby my DVD especially my Lord of the Rings extended edition DVDs; but I've opened my DVD probably no more than five times and it's already falling apart. It's a shame, shame, shameful thing. It stinks; and I hope they repair their error and go back to the original manufacturer of the Fellowship of the Ring DVD. This new one look good behind shrink-wrap, but once you open it, it feels cheep and falls apart. Shame on you Jackson for allowing such a beautiful movie to be placed in such a stupid case."
1,"Horrible, boring, just the worst - An Abomination","The Two Towers is just the worst. Hobbits are so boring. The bad guys are so lame, they're werent even any missiles or guns or bombs. This movie is a grotesque abomination. Don't see it. Don't buy it. And oh yah, the DVD is trash as well - its less appealing than a rat vomit."
5,THE best movie around to this day,"The Lord of the Rings the Two Towers is fabulous!The battle scenes makes you feel like you are in the war of the Two Towers! Treebeard and the other Ents was very funny ,and the return of Gandalf was surprising. Overall, the movie was action-pacted and the music was breath taking. I loved this film and definatly think that it is THE best movie around to this very day. See it, you'll be totally blown away."
1,Amazon Unbox Video has garbage quality,"The Two Towers is a great film, however the quality of the version I downloaded from Amazon to play on my PC is terrible. It's simply awful - the credits are blocked like 64bit video game text, for example - and I will not again pay for a film that Amazon delivers in 360p. Bah."
4,One of the best movies of 2002...,While it didn't adhere as faithfully to the book as most LOTR fans would like. The Two Towers is still an incredible movie experience. Andy Serkis' perfomance of Gollum alone is worth the price you pay for the DVD. The special effects are top notch and blend seamlessly with the action and the storyline. This stands in stark contrast with the recent Star Wars films whose digital worlds seem sterile and the special effects seem like a desperate attempt at a distraction from the bad acting and weak plot. Unlike most action/adventure fare that is released today The Lord of the Rings trilogy actually has dynamic characters that the become intimate with the audience and a storyline that quickly engrosses the viewer.
5,aewsome movie,"this is an awesome movie! i loved in from beginning to end. peter jackson did a wonderful job directing and the cast is great. i could watch this again and again i loved it so much. if you haven't seen it, see it."
5,Lord of the Rings Rules over all,"This amazing DvD is am must-have for any LOTR fanatic. The extended battle of Helm's Deep is a valuble insight into Tolkien's world, while Faramir's flashback not only explains his relationship with Boromir, but also introduses an new character. And the Soup scene between Aragorn and Eowyn is just hilarious! Order now, you've missed out on it long enough!"
5,Despite the Hype,"These really have proved to be some of the greatest films ever made. Not only do they have outstanding visual effect, but also spectacular acting (worthy of independent sensations). The DVD itself is loaded with hours of extras that will captivate one for days. Can't wait for the ""Return of the King!"""
3,Compared to Game of Thrones . ...,"When I watched this film in high school, I was taken aback by the visuals effects. As much of the comeback of trilogies or a film narrative spread among 3 films, it feels very outdated.But after reading and watching Game of Thrones. I am a little bored by this trite narrative. And the film is a little sausage intensive. There were opportunities to expand female characters, the film didn't try. I wish it were more realistic of the fantasy period.I think it's weird that someone's head can be chopped off, blown to bits, but romantic encounters reduced to glances or pecks."
5,"This Movie Is Better Than The Origianal ""Star Wars"" Trilogy","When I saw ""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" movie in theaters I was amazed at the stunning visual effects, wonderful drama, and spectacular music (score) it had. But when I saw it's movie sequal ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" I was even more amazed! It had better visual effects, more wonderful drama, and a fantastic music (score) that was even better than it's prequal ""The Fellowship of the Ring"". Ignore all negative reviews about ""The Two Towers"" movie because it's brilliant!"
2,Fairly sad showing,"I was very dissapointed in the second installment of The Lord Of The Rings movies. They took the most mediocre book in the series and turned it into a sub-par action film. It has its moments, but the action scenes drag on and on and seem to have no character development what-so-ever. I was extremely pleased with the first film. Even if it wasn't Tolkien's middle earth. It was still a fine rendition of a classic novel. After this poor showing I certainly hope Jackson and friends can deliver in the third installment."
5,LOTR: TTT Is One Of My Favorite Movies Along-Side FOTR!,"There are no words that can describe how spectacular this movie is! Lord of the Rings: Two Towers is a movie that I highly recommend you buy for DVD. It has amazing special effects, wonderful music (score), and brilliant acting! The action in Two Towers is very intense. The plot the movie has to offer is outstanding! And, best of all, Two Towers has a lot of adventure, fantasy, and drama in it! What more could you possibly want? Lord of the Rings: Two Towers is the winner of two Oscars and four MTV Movie Awards, including best movie, for great achievement in filmmaking. I can't wait to own this movie on DVD! Lord of the Rings: Two Towers Special Extended DVD Edition is another DVD movie I am highly looking foward to buying also."
5,Anticipation At Its Very Height,"I wish Lord of the Rings: Two Towers DVD were out now! I can't wait to own it! I saw the movie in theaters and liked it better than Fellowship of the Ring, its great prequel. The special effects were stunning! The acting was superb! The musical (score) was remarkable! And the plot goes by author J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings book trilogy very well! Two Towers will be a must own DVD. And the Special Extended DVD Edition of Lord of the Rings: Two Towers will be a marvel to own!"
2,yawn,I don't understand the adulation these movies have received from their fans. Especially the Two Towers. Lots of fun if you like endless UGLY battle footage. And mud.Ivan Rorick
1,STOP - READ FINE PRINT!,"STOP!Do not make the mistake I did. I bought this because the product page stated this was the extended version on blu-ray. It was not. If it is important to you, make very sure you are purchasing what you want. I did not research this and trusted amazons description which states it is a branch style extended version. This was only the theatrical release. For the Two Towers, if it says 170-180 minutes, it is the theatrical version. if it is over 220 minutes, then it is the extended. I am very disappointed in amazon for saying that I was purchasing the extended version in their description when it was ONLY the theatrical. The ""What do you Get"" section is WRONG for theatrical version. Amazon providing an in-accurate product page caused me to purchase the wrong version. The 1 star is due to amazon selling me the theatrical while describing it as extended. Thusly the product is not as described."
5,Another 5 star wonder.,"Once again, Peter Jackson does the impossible by essentially pulling off a movie that has no legitimate beginning or ending! He pulls it off with such ease and magnificence (I must add) that nobody really pays attention to the fact that these movies were and are the grandest moments in the history of film. Things were dreamed and accomplished that would have seemed ridiculous to most film directors. PJ once again takes the viewer directly INTO middle earth. I mean, i've read the books at least 15 times in my life, and the one thing that strikes me most about these movies is the complete fidelity to Tolkien's vision of Middle earth. True, the plot has been tweaked, but the essential elements of the story are still there. PJ's downright Puritanical fidelity to the author's vision of this world makes these movies so enjoyable that a tweak here or there in storyline is more than bearable. Buy all of these movies, make 12 tubs of popcorn, and enjoy!"
4,Aging Tolkien Novice Cries Out to Purists,"Have the well thumbed books on my shelf. Learned a long time ago that my imagination was better than any cinematographer/director/producer so I no longer expect the author's take (which is merely MY interpretation of the author's view) when consuming someone else's vision of it.That said, get a life. We each have our own interpretation of what we ingest. If you don't like the interpretation, don't pour your money into the coffer that will continue to offend you for it will only come back to condemn your vision further."
3,did not like movie,Ordered all 3 movies...we never watched and wanted to see what all the fuss was about. The movie came quick and in great condition...but the movies were cheesy and a Harry Potter storyline rip off
2,Read the books,"the only reason i would buy this dvd is because of the preview for return of the king.Hopefully this movie has inspired people to read the trilogy, as well as the Silmarillion and tolkien's lost tales. Tolkien is a master storyteller and Peter Jackson can only do his best to tell the story faithfully by following the book as closely as possible.This movie trilogy proves that reading the book is much better than the movie."
5,Best Movie of the Year,"I just love this movie; it is a follow-up to the first movie - The Fellowship of The Ring. No matter what others say, The Lord of The Ring Movies are the best movie making in a very long time (next to The Matrix). This even supercede The Star Wars trilogy 100X. I can't wait for next year - the Return of The King - the final trilogy. And best of all, I can't wait for the extended version of the DVD. LORD OF THE RINGS ROCKS!!!"
5,Best Trilogy,"The LOTR trilogy is the best one ever. The visual effects, the action, its all great. One of the few good book-to-movies. Absolutely brilliant! i give it a A+. A must have!"
5,Lord of the Rings Review/purchased from Amazon,"I loved the movie. I read the books years ago and loved them. My Two Towers broke, probably worn out. I got another one and it's great. I'm glad they had it, because they are not in stores any more."
5,amazing!,This movie is incredibly good. It's a must-see film for fantasy fans and people who just want to see a great film.
5,Absolutely AWESOME,"Well, if you thought Fellowship of the Ring was good, The Two Towers steps up to the plate and works just beautifully as the sequel.Of course, the main elements are the battle at Helm's Deep, the return of Gandalf (now the White), entirely CGI Gollum, and ditto CGI with Treebeard.It's just an absolutely cool movie! It doesn't need a bunch of sex and bad words to make it worth going to either. The only problem people might have with it is violence, which can be intense for youngsters, and even adults.Still, I loved the movie. It works excellently with Tolkien's second book in the trilogy, though there ARE some bones to pick with it: some things are definitely changed, the biggest one taking place in Faramir, who in the books is a stout, brave-hearted nobleman who refuses to give in to the temptation of the Ring. In the movie, it's quite different.Otherwise, it's really great, you should see it!"
3,Read the fine print on the rebate carefully...,"Why would I buy the theatrical version when this extended version exists? Stupid rebate policy on this one, Amazon."
2,"Man, this STUNK","Peter Jackson should be ashamed of himselffor what he's done to a piece of classicfantasy literature. Characters, especiallyGimli, are altered for comic relief. Scenesare so changed that they're barelyrecognizable. This was terrible. I highlysuggest buying the book and skipping thisdreck."
2,oww,"ranks as just about as nearly as bad as the second Star Wars (money....) movie in terms of complete disapointment. a sprawling, directionless, monotonous mess filled to the brim with : unrealistic way too polished looking computer FX (like I haven't seen this ruin a movie before, ahem the new star wars syndrome, ahem), terrible, confused actors on par with low budget computer game cut scenes, and generic, irritating ""medieval fairy war"" music that will shake your brains right out of your head (perhaps an attempt to make you gaze in awe at this poor pathetic attempt at a film). All in all the experience was like having to sit through a very long and somewhat bad ""in between mission"" computer graphic laden cut scene in some geeks ""medieval battle"" computer game. this ... - and yes, read the book instead. the end."
2,It's a nice movie - a pity they didn't make the Two Towers,"Well, as I suspected upon watching this in the theater, this movie reveals the lack of appreciation amongst the director and cast for Tolkien's books. At several places they mention how little they think about the way Tolkien developed this or that character or plot element. They completely misunderstand what Tolkien was saying about Faramir's character, and where they do retreat to an almost-Tolkienian love story between Aragorn and Arwen, they admit that this was after trying to make Arwen into a warrior and failing.The movie is entertaining, and the casting, staging and effects are superb. It's just a shame they decided not to make Tolkien's story into a movie. This one is along the lines of ""inspired by"" fluff."
