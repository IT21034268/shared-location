4,Inspiring,"Angela Davis stands in my perspective as one of the most accomplished women of the postmodern era. This autobiography draws from her childhood to her young adulthood. Her account of prison life includes an unsentimental analysis of the sexual habits of women in prison. One factor that prevents me from giving this memoir a 5-star is her abandonment of her personal life as a woman. She focuses entirely on the black power movement. In closing, this memoir can offer women the strength to fight injustice but encouraging them to first empower themselves."
2,It should have been a fascinating story. . .,"Having grown up in central California during the 70s, Angela Davis was vilified in my family. This made me want to read her book all the more. Unfortunately it's presentation is delivered in a very boring way, concentrating heavily on her trial, which is quite boring in comparison to the rest of the book. Also, Davis' anti-White attitude is on display, which prevents her from delivering a non-partial, even account of the times. I can forgive a slanted view on the times, but not a boring, slanted view."
4,Great value except shiupping charges,I purchased two of these and they work great. This is a great value for the price charged for the batteries alone.The price was the best I could find anywhere but I was charged nearly $13 for shipping and handling. Shipping charge of > 2.5 times the cost of the items seems a little excessive.DMR
3,disposable bowl,"I love the food processor, but the handle on the work bowl breaks a little too often. This is my third replacement bowl since 2008."
2,Poor quality materials and design,"After the 1-year warranty expired, the bowl and lid started cracking all over, until I now have to replace it because the handle started detaching. The center stem is way too short which gives it much smaller capacity than 12 cups. When putting the bowl through the dishwasher, moisture and dirt remain in the hollow handle--why would the handle not be sealed?"
2,Fragile design,"I love the base and all the attachments to this food processor. It is powerful, not too loud and looks good, but I need to order another bowl (2nd time) in two years since they just don't hold up. I am a very occasional user, maybe 2 times a month max. If you drop the bowl though, the mechanisms in the handle just don't take the shock well."
3,Still a good product,"I was disappointed that I was unable to get the black handle that used to be available. The bowl remains difficult to remove without reaching in and twisting the blade. Otherwise, a great processor."
4,Strolli review,"This stroller add-on has been worth it to me so far. I've had it for a couple months, and it seems to be well made and keeps my 4 year old from kicking the 1 year old out of the stroller so I have to carry the 1 year old. I like it better than the bucky board or kiddie board options because I don't have to shorten my stride to keep from stepping on it when I push the stroller. The down side of it seems to be that my taller than average 4 year old has to turn his head to one side when we make a turn in the direction it's attached to, to keep the stroller handle from hitting his head. He doesn't mind though. And it's one more piece of equipment to keep in my trunk. But if I have only one kid with me I don't have to hook it up and that's convenient."
5,Will Not Disappoint,"Season Six does not disappoint. Monk's character is funny, serious and loveable. I can not say enough good stuff about Monk. Great show!"
5,You'll Thank Me Later,"Actually you can thank the seller pretty quickly. They deliver quickly and of course, ""MONK"" is just the best~"
5,Monk-Season six,I have the whole collection and will get the final season when it's available. Shame it can't go on forever.
5,DVD of Season 6 for Monk,"As always, the 6th season of Monk is terrific. The DVD set was delivered as promised. We have purchased most of the Monk series from Amazon and have never been disappointed with our purchase."
2,Temporary Solution,"I ordered at the end of 2011 and it arrived with a bad connector. After cutting the shell apart and soldering in one wire in the pryed open terminal and insulating the wires with heat-shrink performance in the telephone was restored to new --- for about six months. After that the battery pack didn't last any longer than the other two phones which had their original batteries for several years and before I had it in there for a full year it died comletely.Internal construction (cut the plastic cover) is good, so all I can determine is the battery cells must be of poor quality. That and the effort necessary to ""rework"" the connector cost the review a star.There are lots of reviews better than mine, but I wonder how long they waited before evaluating the product and what the reviews would be a year after puchase(?). Just to compare though, I bought two cell phone batteries years ago from a different vendor and they are still going strong... . Your milage may vary."
2,Doesn't Fit Vtech TM311 phones,"Although 1 or more sources claimed otherwise, this battery does NOT fit w Vtech TM-311 phones. Amazon was nice enough to pay for shipping them back & gave a full refund quickly & easily. Go Amazon!!"
3,Not very good,"I can make some use of this book since I've been making wine and liqueurs for a long time.But this book is not at all useful for someone just starting out - only historical value.This is an old book with a new cover, originally published in 1909. The author assumes youalready know how to do everything she mentions, have all the gear she uses, so on and sofourth. All you have are her recipes. Nothing to help you figure anything out, such as:Amounts (Hundredweight, pennyweights...)Terms/things (Fume the vessel with brimstone, alembic...)Ingredients (isinglass, rhatany root, red tartar, catechu, logwood, tincture of kino, canary, savin... )I love it, but that's me..."
2,"Decent sound, poor noise cancellation","These headphones were bought as a gift to me. They are okay, as in not great not terrible. fairly durable, as they have lived in my backpack for a year almost now. Noise cancellation is terrible though, i would say spend a few more dollars and get some over-ear; as opposed to these on ear types."
1,it is for sale if they have no product,"Dear friends, I make the purchase of this product I was accepted, I was charged to my credit card, I was assigned a purchase order after the order charged did not then appear and I have no way of tracking that purchase, I would like to know which was the that way, if you do not have the product Deveria publish, that we the buyers do not go through the hassle that this generates, time and hassle, thanks."
3,Blum Locking Device For Inset Tandem Drawer Slides,It works when you mount it YOUR way and NOT the way they say to. The screw that goes in at an angle raises the other end of the device and causes it to raise from the surface and not work. Remove the plastic guide and use that hole to screw down flush and add a sticky glue (such as shoe-goo) to hold the other end down flush to the surface (no way to screw it down).
3,Blue Stoneware Salt Pig,"It is pretty on the counter, but it is just too small to be much more than a decoration, unless you have time and inclination to use the tiny spoon. It I could reach in an grab a pinch of salt, and it held more salt, I would have rated five stars."
3,Conservative Monk,"This is a clear effort at making Monk more palatable to a wider audience at the time. The pairing of Monk and Ellington's tunes is certainly a natural, but these are conservative, occasionally even boring (Don't Mean A Thing...zzzz) renditions that sound like the the ""Monk"" knob in the recording studio was turned down very, very low.Most of the playing is charming and enjoyable, and fans of Monk and Ellington both will certainly enjoy this. Just don't expect to be ""Wowed"" by it."
4,Two Masters At Work,"I thought this was a fine album. I agree with some reviewers that this was not Monk ""unleashed."" Still, it's neat to hear one master interpret the work of another. That's what you get here.Now, wouldn't it have been neat to have the reverse of this as well? You know,""Duke Ellington Plays Thelonious Monk""? I'd love to hear Duke play HIS version of ""Straight, No Chaser"" or ""'Round Midnight"" with a combo or even his big band!"
3,BEGINNING OF THE END,"This show lasted 11 seasons...The 1st 6 seasons were great...Season 7 is the beginning of the end....This was when the show transformed into a full blown cartoon.....One major reason is Ron Leavitt left the show (Ron Leavitt and Mike Moye created the show)The kid Seven was a disaster....Al became a full blown Homer Simpson.....The storylines started to get sillier..the show lost its nastiness and became slapstick.....The seasons 8-11 are complete disasters......There are still some good reasons to get this season....Even though the show started to decline, there were still enough solid episodes to keep this season respectable.....Christina Applegate never looked better, and the episodes that focused on Kelly were great....Faustino also had a very solid season with storylines...Jefferson also had his best season.......So it is still a good season, but not great.....As far as I am concerend the show ended after this season..the next four seasons are not even worth talking about"
5,Married With Children vol. 7,"What can I say. If you like the Married With Children series then you and I will say, ""its great."""
5,"""Unlucky Number 7""","You've gotta admit, that kid Seven ruined a perfect show. Luckily, he didn't last. I still give this season 5 stars, simply because the rest of the cast were very funny. Looking forward to season 8, (no Seven!!) < that lil' turd!"
4,The Season Where The Magic Starts To Fade,"I always loved Married with Children every since it first started airing on US TV. But, this is the season where the magic starts to fade. The characters were always given wonderful witty dialogue. However, in season seven you'll only find a few minimul jokes, a few good episodes, and mostly fillers in between. Overall, this is still a great show and a decent season. MWC will always set a milestone in the realm of sitcoms. Still enjoyable nonetheless because of the loveable cast of actors."
4,virada turning point,"ja nao tem mais aquele pique das temporadas anteriores, mas como eu sou fa eu recomendo assim mesmo.that is not like it was once before anymore, but as a fan, i recomend it anyway."
3,Good product if a gas grill is not an option,"This definitely does not char food as well as a gas or charcoal grill, but with experience and trial-and-error, you can get decent results. It's easy to clean and maintain. Also works pretty well as a smoker if you get some wood chips. Be warned: it's a bear to assemble. If you can buy it pre-assembled, do it. I'm into my 3rd year with this, and it's still going strong."
3,"Ok, for electric",I was hoping for more of a grilled flavor with this but it is ok for what it is. You don't have the dangers of gas or the mess of charcoal. Things cook pretty slow on it too. For the price I wish I had purhased a gas grill instead.
3,Good In Principle,I bought this for my Grandparents since they do not feel safe online ordering and I told them I would put it together for them. The directions are nearly impossible to follow. The directions contain several models and do not distinguish very well between what model you have purchased and what parts you need to put together to assemble your own grill. The grill works fine when cooking however. If you don't have difficulty with directions this grill will work for you.
5,Review of Meco Electric Grill,"I've used Electric Grills for over 30 years. Meco is the best in my opinion. Get the same tasty grilled meats like acharcoal or gas grill, without the fuss. No lava rock needed. Easy to use all year round."
3,meco grill,"the grill is good lookingi had to spend $35 to asswmble itthe name on the item is not meco.the name is AUSSIE GRILL.i do not have a cover yet, and it is outdoors on my terrace.the only way that i could protect the electric plug is putting it in a plastic bag and putting into the BBQ and closing the top when cool.i grilled some eggplant and it seemed to do the job.i do not love it, but things that live on an outdoor terrace do not have a long life and need to be replaced about every 2 to 3 years. i would have been happier if it was priced at about $100.thank you.irma sragg"
4,Electric Cart Grill,"This is a great little grill. Its quick and does a great job. I don't have the tune to wait for charcoal and didn't want the hassle of gas. Did a lot of cooking this summer, so I didn't have to turn on my stove. It is important to clean it right away. I would definitely recommend this product."
1,Disappointed and Wish I could return,"The grill is so close to the electric outlet below, and the temperature setting is vague: so food (hamburgers, steaks, chickens, etc. ) all come out burnt, overcooked on the outside, but uncooked inside. Cleaning the grill is a pain as well. Will not recommend it to anyone. Personally, I would like to return the darned thing if I could."
1,Poorly Designed and Destined to Fail.,"Don't buy this grill or the table top unit built like this, it will fail with time! I have owned the table top unit for several years now and I am giving up on it forever. I have probably put four elements in the grill over the years( @ about $60). Eventually the element will burn out but not before the control unit has a loose connection and burns wires loose on the element. It happens every time! I have been repairing the loose connection with some soldering effort to make the element last till burn out. No more. I am trying the charbroil patio model. The replacement elements are cheaper and I hope they don't have a connection problem on the control unit. They could probably fix this engineering issue but prefer to keep selling replacement elements! Don't get me wrong, I have been using an electric grill since about 1990. I love them when they work!"
1,Piece of JUNK!,Grill is hard to assemble and even worse to use - the grate is way too close to the heating unit - worse grill we have ever had or used
3,"It cooks okay, BUT","The design of this grill leaves something to be desired. It is difficult to clean and the drip tray is a little aluminum loaf pan that is hard to insert into the holder without mangling it.The electric burner has an aluminum pan under it which catches all the juices, grease, etc., which causes it to smoke heavily.The rotissery works pretty good. My last one was a CharBroil and it was far superior to this one."
5,Great electric grill,"When you can't have charcoal or gas on a condo deck, this is a great option. Good size and does a better job grilling meats than expected!"
2,Not impressed,"I purchased this for my outdoor deck in the city due to restrictions on charcoal and gas grills. I am very disappointed in this one. It cooks very slowly. It takes a long while to heat up and takes time to cook everything. For example I put hot dogs on this and it took 20 minutes for them to cook. I could have cooked them faster on the stove. Speaking of the stove, this electric grill makes everything taste like it was cooked indoors on my stove. I guess that is what is to be expected and I should have realized an electric grill is the same as an electric fry pan..but the fry pan is quicker. I have had this a month now and after using it 3 times I have retired it to the shed."
2,WoW!,"Great little grill. The catch pan is cheaply made. A bucket would work better.Update: These grills break after a while. It may be the heating elements. I don't know, but I have ordered two. They both stopped working in the same manner."
3,Review for Meco Grill,"This is the third Meco grill I have purchased and have almost always been pleased. This time, I did have a few complaints. First, the handle on the side that controls whether you grilling or in rotissierie mode, does not stay in place. It always shifts to grilling. Second, the pan underneath is not sized correctly so no matter how you try to move it with the handle, the grease drips around it an does not go into the grease drip container. Other than that, the grill works fine."
5,nice set,"really nice speakers. decent sound.. good enough for a dorm room. compact size, very user friendly. i would recomend them to everyone who wants a decent set of speakers for a good price."
2,Works fine but not for bedroom. It glows very brightly when off.,This works well for the price but the very bright blue lights are beyond annoying. I have this in my bedroom and have to unplug it at night or it lights up the entire room. Wish there was a way to remove the lights. Thinking of trying to smash them.
4,Decent sound at a decent price,"I bought four of these for Christmas presents. The sound is good for a bedroom or office, but not as a main home audio system. Setup is a snap and the remote works as advertised. This unit makes a great gift for a teenager or younger child owning any version of the iPod."
1,Don't recommend,"I purchased this item in August 2006 and the remote didn't work. I returned the unit and exchanged it for another unit. This one worked well for 4 months but then the volume adjustment both on the unit and the remote stopped working. Since the unit only has a 90 day warranty I can't return it. Was fine when it worked, but not a reliable unit. I would not recommend this product."
1,Beware!,"Amazon LLC sells this product in two colors.Black. And white.I waited patiently.Somehow I received PINK speakers! Which is amazing, when pink is not even a color option! What's even more amazing, is that the item # on the box matched what I had ordered from Amazon! It made me wonder if everyone ordering white is receiving pink, but I'm probably just a lucky fluke.I'm only slightly displeased. My new speakers will arrvive 2/1/08, the same item # again, hopefully I receive the white speakers pictured above that I had originally ordered, but... Amazon's customer service was amazingly helpful and their return service is easy as well.I do most of my shopping online, and I have never experienced faster easier to deal with customer support. Hopefully I'll get white speakers this time!"
4,Best in hes Class!!,"I bought this, for me, a really chip price. I was not expecting the best quality sound but it fool me, it sounds really great, not BOSE style but a very good sound, i recomended it..."
4,good room filling sound for the price. But...,"Overall I'm very pleased with the purchase of this item. It's small enough to fit almost anywhere, and although not mentioned as being portable, size once again comes into play for portability. Sound quality is excellent. Only problem I have encountered is with the remote. The remote features separate volume up and down buttons. A play/pause button. I run into a problem with the dual functioning skip back/rewind track and skip forward/ fast forward track buttons. Almost always, rather than skipping a song completely, it either rewinds or fast forwards through the entire song, forcing you to either listen to a jumbled version of the music, or get up and manually choose the song you want. If you can get past this little annoyance, the overall product is excellent."
1,I've returned this item,"I've returned this item because the color is not pearl white as the website showed, plus, my friend also did not like this color since it does not match with her iPod."
2,At least the charger works,"Only buy this item if you desperately want to listen to your ipod out loud. The remote control I received did not work right out of the box. It will control the power and volume of the unit but will not pause, skip, or repeat tracks on the ipod. Sound quality is barely passable. No bass and no highs, only a muddy sounding midrange. The only thing I could compare it to are the small, handheld transistor radios that were popular in the seventies. The charger dock works fine but will not charge my ipod with a protective rubber sleeve on it. It also has a cool blue light that shines behind your ipod when the unit's power is on. It's a shame about the sound quality and the faulty remote because the unit itself is nice and heavy and feels very solid. If you have any other alternatives, I would advise to skip this one."
4,Great Deal for less than $50,"I bought this speaker set-up so that I could listen to my iPod in the kitchen. It works just fine. No, it doesn't have the sound of an expensive unit, but for $49 bucks I have no complaints. I can put my iPod Mini on shuffle, and enjoy the tunes while I'm cooking dinner or eating breakfast. If you want home theatre sound, buy something else. But if you just want to hear your music without paying a lot of money, you'll be very pleased with this unit. I am."
2,Not quite,"Even for the price, I still wouldn't suggest this one. Spend the extra bit of money and get good speakers. I needed to put the ""bass booster"" equilizer on on my iPod mini so that it would sound decent. It doesn't come with any adapters for different iPods (mini, nano, video, etc.), you can only have one device plugged in at once (CD player and ipod. it will not play the ipod), and the remote is second to useless. Spend the bit of money and get good speakers. The JBL OnStage iPod Speakers are superb, even for inexpensive speakers. If you don't want to pay that much, get regular old speakers."
1,don't buy this docking station,"I read about the issues in prior reviews before buying this product, but since I was simply looking for something to play music on at a very low volume at my desk at work, I wasn't concerned with the sound quality. The unit worked fine for a few months, but as many other reviewers noted I suddenly lost all volume control, and now it will only play on maximum volume, which makes it completely worthless. Its out of the 90 day warranty so I now have to toss it and buy something new. The product is inexpensive, but not worth it if you have to buy a new one every 90 days."
2,"GPX iLive ISPK2806 iPod Speakers with Remote Control & Dock for iPod, Mini, Shuffle, and Nano (1G)",This product is styled very nicely but the quality of sound is below current acceptible standards. My first transistor radio sounded better!
4,Not bad,"The bass isn't great, but the sound is pretty clear and I've had no problems with volume control. However, I wish that there was a button to switch through playlists. It's kind of awkward to use the scroll wheel on the iPod when it's docked into the speakers."
1,"Oh, Please!",This book is obviously written by someone who is obsessive about housework. The suggestions were so absurd our whole office was in stitches when I read portions out loud. (For example - frisk the dog each time he comes into the house to check for dirt hidden in it's fur.) The authors snide insinuations about why your house is dirty were insulting. (For example - maybe your house is dirty because you come home from work and want to rest for a few minutes when you should be starting right away on housework.) A total waste of money.
5,A sane and scientific approach to understanding mentoring,"Jean Rhodes, professor of psychology at UMass-Boston and former faculty member at Harvard and UChicago, has written the most thorough book to date about the mentoring process. Employing superb research skills and accessible language for both a professional and lay audience, she captures some of the essential components of mentoring that we as a society need to discuss from both a public policy perspective and a psychological care approach. Her analysis and discussion of ten years of empirical research help support her arguement with essential data that adds to the growing body of knowledge on mentoring. This is a book for community activists, religious leaders, social scientists and concerned citizens.PM Camic, PhD, Professor of Psychology and Education, Columbia College Chicago"
2,it sucks,It took me almost fifteen days to get the candies.It tasted not like the soda candies I had before.The deadline is only two months in the future.
3,Picked up at a local store,"I have a very bad ^_^ habit of picking up Japanese candy and this one fell victim to that. I found it slightly odd. The package is very unique and adds to the over all cool idea of the candy. At first glance it looks like a normal hard candy till you put it in your mouth. My first reaction was wow what is this it's fizzy, then I spent the rest of the time trying to figure out what cola tastes like that. I've shard this with my friends it's not a bad flavor, just different, and has a fun aspect like pop rocks. I still have a few left :P"
2,meh,"I LOVE gummy colas, and I enjoy pop rocks well enough. So when I saw the rave reviews for this cola-flavored candy I thought I HAVE TO TRY THIS!!! Alas, they were only okay. They tasted fine, like hard gummy colas. The faint fizziness was interesting. But NOT worth eight bucks, nuh-uh. Especially after sucking on two of them in a row caused the roof of my mouth to get sore. Next time I want a candy cola flavor, I will go round up some of my gummies. :("
5,Great Resource for Teachers and Students,"This huge volume is an excellent resource for teachers and students of Asian history. It contains dozens of essays on Asia and the west, Asia and the world, and themes in Asian history, written by some of our finest historians. The information on Asian history, culture, and religions is fascinating and accessible. For high school AP World History teachers like me, it is an invaluable reference because it provides both great scholarship and intriguing little ""hooks"" we can use to keep the students interested. I keep this book in my classroom at all times."
2,Limping,"The ever-commendable Nancy and company are heading up the youth campaign to save the recently fire-gutted River Heights recreation center. Suspecting foul play beyond even the missing insurance payments, Nancy knows her hunch is correct when someone begins sabatoging the fundraising and threatening the campaign leader, Mary McGregor.Although it's nice to see the girls back at home in River Heights, it's too bad they couldn't have had a better mystery to enjoy while they were there. THE SUSPECT IN THE SMOKE, while not exactly lame, still limps along, at best."
5,Love Frank Asch's books,"I love the story lines and the illustrations of Frank Asch's books, so well written, understated, but also bright and cheerful, they make such wonderful read alouds too. This one stands out as one of his best to me. A classy Halloween story."
2,Looked like a Photo Copy,"I had a hard time finding this title, which was a childhood favorite. As happy as I was to find it, I somehow missed that it was a ""mini edition"" and was pretty disappointed when I received it in the mail. It looked like nothing more than a shrunken photo copy of the real book with a staple holding the pages together. Buy it if you really want the book and can't find it anywhere else. I wouldn't buy it for a gift...it looks really cheap."
5,popcorn,"my sister and i have been looking all over for this book, had no idea what the name was.. we remember it from we would go to the doctor years and years ago...i love this book and plan to pass it on to my nieces..."
2,Not so good,This book was very small... When they say mini they mean it. I would not recommend a book of this size to anyone. Book came on time and was in acceptable condition. I would order from this seller again in the future. I would not recommend this product to others.
5,the popcorn story,I like this book because it deals with something that kids will understand. his parents leave for a party so the kid bear has a party of his own. every guest brought popcorn and he decices to fix it all and it fills up the house with popcorn. They eat all the popcorn and clean the house so his perents never know what happened. his parents came home and they brought him some popcorn. This is a great story for kids around the halloween time
2,Strong Eyes,"You will need either very strong eyes, or thick glasses to read this because it is SO small. I was NOT happy with what came. I knew it was a mini book, but even small things are required to have some amount of quality. This was not quality. It indeed feels like a color copy that someone threw together with a few staples. Shame on the publisher for allowing this treatment of such a wonderful children's book."
2,Teeny Tiny Mini Edition,"Please look carefully at the product specs, especially the size: 5.3 x 4.1 x 0.4 inchesI bought it because I loved this book as a child and the large version was way overpriced, but this mini book was not worth $4...maybe $2. It would make a nice stocking stuffer or Easter basket goodie but it's not really sturdy enough for children to use, and the type is too small for a early reader to comfortably read.I was so excited about finding this book that I overlooked the size. I absolutely love this story, just not this copy! My kids sat on the floor around me and I read this to them, and they could barely see the pictures because of the ""mini""ness of this book."
3,Cute,"It was better than expected. I don't care for Hillary's singing voice, or her attitude towards some things, but I liked the movie. It was cute, mainly for kids and young teens, but I still was fond of it. I felt bad for Gordo though in the airplane scene."
1,"The worst movie of all time, right by all Disney Movies","This is the worst movie of all time, well, i say that about pretty much every Disney movie(Exept Pirates of the Carribean).Hillary should stick to doing... ummmm...well... what does she do good at? Well i can tell you that it is not acting or singing for SURE. I only watch this movie when i want to fall asleep, but i stopped because it kkept giving me horrible nightmares. This movie was just a huge, crappy publicity ad for Duff. And i'lll guess she is gunna be the next Britney spears, I'll give her 2 years untill she starts swearing and wearing skimpy Clothes. So basicly we have all had enough of Hiliry Duff."
4,I'm REALLY too old for this...,"OK, so last week was my sixteenth birthday, and, as a joke, my friends and I rented this video. I wouldn't buy if you have a weak and cynical stomach... the movie is a little campy. However, it's not at all bad, as you hear from the president of the I HATE LIZZY MCGUIRE CLUB. If you know someone who's younger than me, esp. if they like the show, then they will enjoy this movie."
5,A GREAT FAMILY MOVIE !,I think that this movie is enjoyable for all ages. if you like singing and dancing you will love this movie ! and the location is a great place for a movie like this it will make you want to go to rome. and if you like lizzie mcguire the t.v seris you will love this . it is about lizzie mcguire she just got out of high school. and is going to rome when she is in rome she is meeting secretly with a rome popstar named palo and she looks like his singing partner and ...... by the movie to see the rest even though marinda is not in the movie it is still good matts still doing scemes . and thats why you should see the lizzie mcguire movie!
2,Alternate Ending,"We saw this movie in the theaters because my daughter is a Duff fan. It was far more tolerable than I expected it to be, though I won't give it 'good' or 'enjoyable'.When it came out on DVD, Disney advertized an alternate ending. My husband endulged and we now own it. The alternate ending is a 30 second tacked on bit in the plane home in which Lizzie exclaims, ""At least I got to keep the clothes!""If I can keep just one person from buying this movie, my time here will have been worth it."
4,HILARY DUFF IS HOT,HILARY IS SO HOT AND I AM ONE OF HER BIGEST FANS I WISH I COULD DATE HER. YES I'M A GUY. I LOVE YOU HILARY DUFF.
2,Lizzie McGuire....How Disapppointing,"I am 16 and I was very disappointed. Lizzie was a brat in this. Kate was incredibly nice, and Ethan was smart. I think it was really mean of Lizzie to totally ditch Gordo for the cute popstar. Some parts were ok but the plot was dumb. They were nothing like the TV characters people love. I think if you see this movie you are bound to be let down, because of its slowness."
5,the best movie ever,I Loved it so much . Hillary Duff is really really cool in her acting and singing. I love Lizzie Mcguire i watchd the series and still do so im begging my mum for the Lizzie Movie. This is a extreme must to buy.
1,This movie SUCKED!,"I HATE this movie. This movie is one of the WORST and BORING movies of all time. Hilary Duff CANNOT act OR sing! She's a freakin' poser for God's sake! And the movie is SO unrealistic. A high school trip to Rome?! PLEASE! The whole movie was horrible, not funny, and just plain boring. Hilary Duff should give up acting and singing for the sake of the world. Even better, work at McDonalds, Hilary!! LMAO. All in all, this movie sucked, and is a TOTAL waste of money. (I gave it too my older sister who's obsessed with Hilary Duff :P)"
5,Awesome!,"What a great movie! I can't wait till it comes out on DVD! I loved it.In the upcoming season, I want Gordo and Lizzie to hook up, and share more kisses like they did at the end of the movie.A must see!"
3,It was an ok movie,"I saw the movie two days after it came out, and the theater was packed.. As I was walking out, I overheard two woman saying that it was a really dumb and very terribly made movie. I can't say I don't agree with them, but I can't say I do. The movie is about.. you know what, just watch the preview. While I was watching the movie, I was waiting and waiting for something to happen, something exciting, something fun to watch, but it never came. The only part I liked was probably the part everyone likes -- the part where.. sorry can't tell you, you have to see it for yourself. This movie is the type of movie that you see it and that's it, you don't have to see it again.Well, I hope that you like it (if your 9-13 (the tween ages))!"
2,Over-rated,"I mean, an impossible plot, and an annoying cartoon character? C'mon, even a sloth could have made a better movie than this. The plot was cheesy and predictable. Stay home and watch the show instead. Not recommended"
1,Toxic waste from Heck...,"Not so long ago, Disney used to churn out silly, wearisome crap like this on a regular schedule. Herbie the Love Bug is one example of how bad these movies can get. After watching 10 excrutiating minutes (Believe me, thats all I could take before the nausea kicked in) of this dreck, I was wishing for a Herbie the Love Bug marathon.Duff can't act, sing nor does she have any on-screen appeal. She is just another pop star clone created by Disney and her publicist, stamped with a ""safe for kids"" label. Don't worry parents, your 14 year-old Ritilin addicted daughters will love this waste of film due to the mindless dialog, music video styled, rapid-fire camera work and the fasion show scenes.Plus there's no trace of true romance to be found in Duff's boring, sanitized world. To make things worse, in Duff's Italy everyone speaks English. Children should not be subjected to this much stupidity in one film; steer clear of this one."
1,Disney movies are ruining the world!,"What I hate about Disney movies is how they give a false sense of reality. In Disney's world, there are no such things as corruption(Disney), terrorism, racism, violence, hatred, greed(Disney), or anything that is constantly plaguing the human race. In this movie, Britney wannabe Lizzie goes to Europe and suddenly becomes a pop star! This movie is not funny at all; in fact, none of Disney's movies are funny. If you found this movie funny, or if you find any Disney comedy funny, I feel sorry for you. Lizzie is encouraging child molesters to molest children(something Disney enjoys to see). Boycott Lizzie!"
3,"eeeeehhhhhhhh, soso...........","The story line didn't really make alot of sense. I mean, one of the main points was that he lied and said he was sneaking out, not her, but he'd been with the group the whole time. Stuff like that, there were alot of really random non-senseical things in the movie. It wasn't a totally ruined movie, and much better than the crappy show. Mad TV's Alex Borstein was hilarious, though. That was probably the only thing that kept this movie from bein a total waste. So-so. I recommend seeing it if it comes on TV, but you probably shouldn't pay money for it. eh."
3,My two cents,"Ok, first of all, I'll agree with everyone saying that the star of the movie is charming. She does a good job (with what they give her).The plot the of the movie is pretty weak. To be honest, it doesn't do the show justice. This movie failed what this great show was built on.BELIEVE me when I say that fans of the show would've rather had this movie based on the changing relationship between Lizzie (Hilary Duff) and Gordo (Adam Lamberg). And to be honest, I would've like to see it as well. Throughout both seasons of the show, you get the vibe that these two characters are going to become something more than 'best friends'. The show ends leaving fans on somewhat of a cliffhanger for these two, so when Disney says they're coming out with a movie that's going to pick up where the show left off, you can't help but assume that that's what the movie is going to be based upon. EEEH! WRONG!All in all, it's an ok movie. But I for one, was disappointed."
4,Hilary Duff is fine for a 16 Year old and she a good actor,"""The Lizzie McGuire Movie"" was not the best movie ever made but it was pretty good considering it was a disney film.The movie starts out with her brother Matt (Jake Thomas) spying on her with a remote control car while she is getting ready to go to graduation from Middle School.After messing up badly at the graduation she goes to the airport to catch a plane to go toRome with her new high school.She and Gordo (Adam Lamberg) get on the plane and start messing around on the plane,all the while showing some affection for each other.When they get to Rome,Lizzie meets a famous pop singer named Paolo whos partner Isabella just ran out on him.Lizzie just so happens to look like Isabella.After finding out a secret about Paolo she goes on stage and lip syncs to an Isabella recording.All in all the movie was pretty good.Hilary Duff does an amazing job as Lizzie and I think this movie deserves and A-"
3,Okay,"Based on the TV show that Mcguire had, I was expecting a lot more from this movie. It was very unrealistic and didn't really display the charm that Mcguire brought to her TV series. It was a sweet movie, but really lacked the interest and excitement I expected."
3,*OK movie..but far too cliched*,Typical...heres why. American girl goes on summer trip to Italy. American girl meets Italian boy. Italian boy happens to be named Paolo (obviously) and of course..American girl rides on the back of Italian boy's moped as they speed away on the streets of Italy away from her school mates. **Yawn** Been there..done that..Ive seen this in other movies..mainly When In Rome starring Mary Kate and Ashley.
2,"damned opening,good ending!!!!!!","for the first time i saw it,3 words lived in my mind:bored,stupid,cheap.........but then,at the end of the movie,i think different:it's a sweet movie(just at the ending!!!)so i don't like hilary duff too much,she's too fat&her; voice got something like britney,she's try to be like britney........i don't like this movie,it's not real for teen even it's have a little bit cute....so if you are want to have real movie,real romantic,you must watch what a girl wants movie!!!"
1,Yikes.,"Wow, I must say that this movie has no redeeming qualities. First off,every actor is in desperate need of acting lessons, or, in lieu of acting lessons, a punch in the throat. Yes, the acting was that bad. The opening montage sets the pace for the rest of the movie, assuming you consider ""Hey look, we're in a city, why are my ears assaulted by the screaming of demons?"" to be a pace. This movie was horrible, and Disney has disappointed before, but this is one of their absolute worst."
2,Fluffy and lacks acting skills,"The whole movie was completely pointless with hillary duff dancing around like some maniac. There is only like one scene in the whole movie without hillary and the plot is completely unbelievable. The only highlight of the entire movie was the extremely HOT italien rock star, Paulo Valisari, who in my opinion is the only one that can act. Yet, the only decent character turns out to be evil in the end! I guess fans of the series will enjoy the sometimes romantic parts of the movie. On the whole, the movie was bad, but if you like hot foreign guys and hillary duff, i guess u may enjoy this film."
2,Enough of Duff!!!,"Two words: Bad Movie.It was what I expect from a Hilary Duff movie, and let me tell you, I wasn't expecting much. The movie was bad. Not terrible, but bad.The whole movie was about a girl who goes to Rome(?) for a some school trip or something, and winds up meeting some famous Italian boy singer who's partner left him. But amazingly, Lizzie McGuire looks exactly like her, so the boy wants her to be his partner. She accepts and then has to fake her way through doing the work she should be doing for school (Naughty girl!!) to secretly meet with that guy.I recommend these movies instead....What A Girl Wants (Amanda Bynes) PG.....Way better!!! A great girl-power story!Agent Cody Banks (Frankie Muniz) PG.....Not a girl story, but still awesome! Hilary Duff is in this one, but not as a main character.Miss Congeniality (Sandra Bullock) PG-13.....One of my favorites! About a tom-girl cop who investigates the Miss America Pageant by going undercover as contestant. Hilarious!"
3,Hilary please dont make a Lizzie Mcguire 2,"I went to see Lizzie Mcguire with the rest of my family at Kendall 9. I wanted to see it since me and my sister were fans of the tv series on the Disney channel. So I go and I almost fell asleep because I got so bored.The best characters were Matt and Lizzie's new principal.It had such a horrible ending with the Paolo dude. My mom cried well my mom crys for every movie including Doug. So just take my advice dont see it when its in theathers and dont buy it when it comes out on dvd. Its a waste of preciously good money. Well save your money ""Dont see the Lizzie McGuire Movie"" Sorry Hilary!!!!!!!"
4,Good flick!,"This movie's pretty good, but it was pretty different from the show Lizzie Mcguire, and I think it could have been maybe just a little bit better, but however, it was still pretty good. I think Lizzie's other best friend, Miranda, should have been in it. It wasn't the same without her. Yes, get ready for a few surprises in this flick. Hilary Duff's movies, for the most part, are really good. However, I think her latest movie, The Perfect Man, is compromised and is hardly as good as her other movies. This movie is a good one to rent or buy. Some other good movies from Hilary Duff are A Cinderella Story, Cadet Kelly, Cheaper By the Dozen, and Raise Your Voice."
2,Drifting in fantasy land,"THis movie was way off in Fantasy Land. First of all it is impossible to look exactly like an Italian pop-star, and be mastaken for him\her. secondly-the chaperone in this movie,miss ungermier would have known that Lizzie was sneaking out of the building.Thirdly, Hilary Duff Seems like such an air- head to go along with some plan a stranger she met has just made up, and believe every word he says. The one and only thing I liked about this movie was getting to sort of get a glimps of Itlay, and its landmarks."
4,I really enjoyed watching it.,"I really enjoyed the Lizzie McGuire movie. It was light and entertaining.But I don't know if I would want my daughter to watch it because it's based on deception and I am really concerned about her not learning the wrong thing.Lizzie is pretending to get sick so she could sneak out and do other things. But for those who already know right from wrong and won't be convinced that lying is ok based on this movie, it's entertaining."
3,O.K. for GIRLS,"I love watching Lizzie Mcguire on T.V. but when I saw the movie it was a little dissapointing because it doesn't seem like most boys would like it because of all the romance, I am a boy and it wasn't as good as the show at least for most boys."
3,"Good, but not up to par","Being a HUGE fan of the series, I expected more from this movie. The plot was pretty bad. I liked the series because I could relate to some of the stories, but this is not as good. I guess this movie is alright if you are less than 12 or 13."
3,Movie based on a TV show,"The Lizzie McGuire TV series is really good, but I think they could have done better on the movie. The type of plot appears in many movies like this. Lizzie goes on a trip to Rome, meets a guy, falls in love with him, sneaks out to see him, and becomes a pop star. There were some good lines, but it was easy to tell how the movie would end. Overall, it wasn't that good of a movie, but I could watch it a few more times."
3,Mixed Bag,"Hilary Duff cannot act to save her life. But, so what! As a 38 year-old male who had to drag his sister's kids to the bijou, I had to sit through this ultimately vapid piece of schlock. Nonetheless, I was still fascinated enough not to have to leave, for Miss Duff is rather well-endowed physically. If only someone could put Gwyneth Paltrow's mind in her body, then Duff would be unstoppable."
1,Give Me a Break!,"I'm not really a fan of Hilary Duff, so I thought that this movie was kind of lame. Hilary isn't that great of an actor, she's kind of fake; like Marykate and Ashley. She's all sappy and the good girl. None of that could ever happen to a normal teen. I wasted my money on this movie. Duff fans would really like this movie. But if you really want great movies get the Lord of the Rings series."
1,"Parents, Think Twice!","The only thought in my mind throughout this whole movie was the Natalie Holloway case, about the girl last summer that went on that school trip, went off with a boy and disappeared. In this movie, Hilary Duff's character is on a school trip to Rome, meets a guy there and then fakes sick to get away from the school group to follow this guy around Rome. I felt so bad that Disney had made this movie showing a young girl going off on her own with a boy she did not know on a school trip because it rang so close to home from that tragic dissappearance of Natalie Holloway. In this movie the only repurcussions the character gets for doing such completely unsafe acts was that she was grounded..and they didn't even show that part. Young girls are very impressionable and will jsut see the glamour in the movie. Hopefully they will be brough up by good parents that will teach them right to know better than to go off with a stranger in a strange place."
2,Oh Dear(1 and a half stars),"As I was reading other reviews, my mouth dropped open. Sure this a kind of cute movie and ""fun"" but there were quite a few problems that I would like to point out.1 The movie forgets one of the best charecters, Lizzies best friend Miranda2 There is no plot whatsoever. Its breezy and predicatable3 Despite the plot problems, they put in too much sap and goo and morals. It's sick4 The Italian charecters are fake sounding with wierd accents that don't sound Italian (and I have been to Italy)5 Some side charecters seem out of placeOverall, the only reason to see this movie is if you love Hillary. WATCH THE SERIES!!!! It is much better. And see Holes, Disneys other movie which is wonderful! Thats all."
3,The Lizzie McGuire Movie,"Although this movie was good, not great, mind you, but good, I felt that it was too different from the TV show to be about Lizzie McGuire. Lizzie's house wasn't the same, the charecters had changed, and the story was a bit unreal.I wouldn't highly recommend this movie, but if you like Lizzie McGuire, then I guess you might like it.P.S. I'm sorry if you don't have the same opinion as me, but please don't criticize me for it."
2,Pure Predictable Trash,"By reading watching the opening sequence and reading on the back of the case one basically already knows what is going to happen. So why watch it? The story is unoriginal, the acting cheesy and fake, and a whale sense of deja vu setlles over you as you realize you've seen this before."
5,Awesome!,"Me and my cousins really like this movie. But here is a list about the big dissapointments that we agree with each other:1) Why couldn't they just hire Hailey Duff (Hilary's sister) to play as Isabella?2) Since Miranda (Lizzie and Gorgo's best friend) NEVER appeared in the last episode of the TV series nor the movie, that means she NEVER got to be in the school's last day's picture nor the movie, or the gratuation, which means she NEVER found out that Isabella looked just like Lizzie!3) Towards the end, why didn't Lizzie and Gordo just still sit outside and watch the pretty fireworks, which began to spell, ""The End""?Overall, this is a great movie. And at the very end, there's a fairy flying by the screen, which turns out to be the Animated Lizzie with wings and a wand. My cousin Diana said, ""Oh, I thought that was Tinker Bell!""."
3,Hilary please dont make a Lizzie Mcguire 2,I went to see Lizzie Mcguire with the rest of my family... I wanted to see it since me and my sister were fans of the tv series on the Disney channel. So I go and I almost fell asleep because I got so bored.The best characters were Matt and Lizzie's new principal.It had such a horrible ending with the Paolo dude. My mom cried well my mom crys for every movie including Doug...
4,"Star light, on Lizzie.","This movie, so far, out of all the disney movie <except Holes> touched my heart. It is so cute. The story line and everything. The whole 'Italian' thing was a great thing. I am 15 and yes, I have been watching the show since it came out. I also love her voice. It pratically gave me goosebumps. I just love it. It was so amazing. All the work they put in, was just enough. Though they should have added some blooper music like in the series. When someone said a sarcastic remark. But overall it is a very good movie and I recommend it to everyone from 1 to 1000 just stop reading and go watch it!"
5,i love you Hilary Duff,"Hey Hilary duff, oh my god i have seen all your movies and t.v showes especially lizzie mcguire and i am so dieing to meet you i have posters everywhere and i've got ur lizzie mcguire album i think you are really prity.hilary duff if you read this i was wondering how i can meet you well hilary, can you email me ppppppplz on melana_witch_btch@hotmail.com and give me ur email addresse for me and oh yeah i am a blonde aswell ok better go now by love mel"
3,Hell's Bells are Ringing for your Children,"Thanks to the production team for a great laugh! While grasping at straws, nearly 200 different musical artists are deemed as part of a greater conspiracy: to make your kids pawns of Satan. The irony of the ""documentary"" is that it opened me up to even more bands that fell under the ""satanic"" label, and after I saw the original ""documentary"" in the early nineties, I was more intrigued than ever to give these bands a listen. Thank you Hell's Bells for opening me up to more music in my childhood!"
5,An updated must have for pastors and teachers,"Hell's Bells 2: The Dangers of Rock 'n' Roll [VHS]is an updated version ofHell's Bells: The Dangers of Rock n Roll (Original Classic).This is a great resource for Pastors, Teachers,and everyone who wants to know what is going on beneath the surface of today's popular music. I do not recommmend this video for very young kids and for people under the age of fifteen without their parents being with them. Eric Holmberg makes a good case and bluntly shows what is going on in today's music.Some of it is quite graphic. I do recommend caution especially for those new in the faith and those who do not listen to rock music."
5,Brilliant evaluation of the dark side of rock music,"This is an eye-opening examination of contemporary music culture. Hells Bells examines the historical, philosophical and (anti) Spiritual roots of much of rock music and points out its effect of much of contemporary culture. This is not just a religious screed or an uptight polemic. The video doesn't rely on interviews with talking heads or ""hell fire"" Pastors ranting and raving, rather, Hells Bells relies on video and the musician's and fan's own words to make its points. Also, there is plenty of historical background data and scientific observation to push the central thesis of the work. The video does not attempt to trash all rock music, or even modern music in general, but is an honest and open minded study on the dark side of rock and its implications for us all. It is another home run by Eric Holmberg and The Apologetics Group. A must see DVD."
3,I cant get them on!,"I tried everything to get this shoes on. It feels as though I have injured myself! They got xxxlarge because I wanted to make sure my shoe would fit. If your shoes have a thick grip underneath it is gonna be very difficult getting them over your shoe. The video post sold me on them but when I went back and looked at it, the reviewer is wearing want appears to be pointed toe casual dress shoes; not big stell with grip underneath. Unfornately they have to go back. I will try their smaller lower version. Hopefully they work. Sorry. I was so hoping I had a great thing."
1,Published Size is Incorrect.,Completely dissapointed. The published size is wrong. Notice the item description is 6.5-8US Wms. The boots are actually 8-9.5 US Women.
3,"They Do the Trick, but Not Over the Moon","I now live in a cool, wet climate and these boots definitely do the trick for keeping out the rain, sleet and snow. My only complaint is that they don't fit snugly over the shoes I wear regularly. I don't wear them often, since they drag and flop with all the shoes I own. I plan on buying some bulky sneakers in the future exclusively for wearing the Overshoes. I'm a little disappointed with the fit of them, but better than buying new boots every Autumn/Winter."
5,Great boots: store easily and work when you need them.,"I've had these now for several months, and just wore them through Winter Storm Nemo for shoveling and walking...and they are every bit what I hoped they would be. These are NOT the flimsy pullovers that used to be popular, and which tore after about three uses. They're heavy duty, but still can roll up into a tight ziploc and go in your backpack. There's a button at the top to allow them to open wide enough to get on, but not flop around after.They take a little effort to pull on, but not that much, and when it's time to take them off, there's a little tab at the heel to give you something to pull on. Be sure to order larger than you think, though. I wear Rockport World Travelers (thick sole) in size 11, and the extra-large size of these is just fine for that, but the large would not be. Haven't tried this trick yet, but a friend with similar boots sprays his shoes with silicon before sliding them into the boots."
4,Order A Size Larger If....,"...you are going to be wearing these over larger-type shoes (like sneakers or work boots), like me. These suited me perfectly, nice easy fit (sz 12) over my sneakers (sz 10.5) which is my normal shoe of choice. However, over a slim or narrow shoe, like a dress shoe, I would order my same size, these would be to roomy."
3,So Far So Good,"I can't give a five-star or other rating until I actually use the product and see how it holds up. But so far so good. The boots look good and they fit. Some reviewers have complained that the boots are too small. I wear a 10 and 1/2 shoe and bought the XL. They ARE snug, to be sure. But if I take a plastic shopping bag such as you would receive from a grocery store and put my shoe (with foot inserted) into the bag and then into the boot, the fit is fine."
3,I have used them for years,"I am a farmer, and I wear these Tingley boots in harsh conditions, and they last about a year. I have used these boots for years, but I am considering switching brands. Simply put, they do not fit. I order the XXL, and my feet are not that big, but they are difficult to get on and remove because the ankle section is too tight, and the heels of my shoes are incredibly difficult to fit into the boots. Farmer that I am, I use silicone spray to enable my shoes to slide into the boot easier. Without the spray, the boots would tear. Alas, my silicone spray keeps disappearing. My wife puts it somewhere, or uses it, and, ergo, we have endless fights. This is getting old, and so I may switch."
3,"Good Boot, Wrong Size",Previous reviews were inconsistent as regards sizing. I wear size 12 New Balance running shoes. I ordered the 2XL based on other reviews. Had to return them. Will try 3XL next.
4,Good boot,Just the thing I needed. Fits over shoe easily and is rugged. Looks good too.I would recommend this to my friends.
3,order at least one size larger,"I wear a size 10 wide tennis shoe, i ordered the large size boot, says fits 9.5 to 11 shoe , they are very hard for me to get on, and they are very tight, I bought these last year and they are still in great shape, and light weight, but I should have ordered the XL, would have made it much easier to get on and off, If you are going to wear these boots over tennis shoes, get the next size bigger FOR SURE and if you have a wide foot, you may want to jump up two sizes"""""
3,Dress shoe boots,"I wear a size 10.5 men's shoe. I first ordered the large size because it said it fits 9.5 - 11 men's shoes. The shoes I wanted to use with these overboots was a hiking shoe with turf cleats on the sole. Well, the large didn't fit. Amazon is great about returns so no problem there. I next ordered the XL men's size which supposedly fits 11 - 12.5 size shoes. Those didn't fit either. In fact, when I put my hiking shoes against the overboots, sole to sole, the shoes were longer than the overboots.So that's why I titled my review ""dress shoe boots"". The sizing appears to be for dress shoes, but any shoe with a substantial sole may have a hard time getting in. I'm going to give it one more try and order the XXL. Normally I wouldn't go to this much trouble but these overboots are really nice - very supple yet they appear to be very strong. The big problem is getting the right size. And when I finally get the right size for my hiking shoes, I'm sure my dress shoes will swim in them."
1,after 6 months they dry rotted and developed holes and cracks,these overboots seem like they are well made but lightweight. they are a little pricey. they're just the thing for a wet day at work.UPDATE!!! i bought these boots in late spring and haven't used them due to a dry summer. they have sit on my covered front porch for six months. i got them out this morning after a rainy night and put them on over my shoes. they have dry rotted and had holes and cracks in them. turns out that they are JUNK.
1,Bad Quality & Fit,"This is by far the worst product I have purchased from Amazon to date. I read all the reviews before purchasing these overshoes and felt confident with the purchase based on all the positive reviews. So based on the reviews, I thought I planned right by ordering Large (Mens 9.5-11) overshoes for my size 8-8.5 shoes. To my surprise, I had to use a tremendous amount of effort to stretch the rubber overshoe over my Rockport casual shoes. When I tried to take the overshoe off, it took my entire shoe off my feet. I can't believe I need to order XL for my small feet. Really poor design in terms of true shoe size. The other problem I had was that the hole used to button the overshoe was completely closed so you couldn't button the overshoe."
2,Useful.,"A nice book. The book is short and a bit ""youngish"" in the pictures and layout. It's encouragement of expression of feeling about moving is so-so. I think it would be most useful with elementary school-aged children. The topic is not covered in depth and I would want more emphasis on learning the culture, language (and the like) about the country to which the child was moving if the child were gifted or older than about 6-7 years."
2,"2/3 good, 1/3 bad","While I realize that this book is intended to be a humorous look at the English language, it still doesn't excuse the mean-spirited male-bashing in which Daly engages.The first two-thirds of the book were indeed fun (hence the extra ratings star). Any attempt to experiment and play with words is great; and trying to bolster women's courage and laughingly shove them into redefining themselves on their own terms--all the better!But why trash men? Daly's definition of heterosexual relationships as being instigated only by men towards women is not only incorrect but insulting. One could almost accuse Daly of being heterophobic, and isn't bigotry supposed to be wrong? I guess all those loving, ethical, funny, and caring fathers/sons/brothers/friends are just figments of a sadly benighted race of ""fembots"" and ""totalled women""."
2,Decent Book....But,"what they don't stress is that this is a text primarily aimed at beginning Comp Sci classes. Though you can use it as a professional, I've found that a lot of the more challenging things are left to the exercises at the end of chapters, which they don't supply the answers to, unless you have the teacher's manual which of course you can't buy without a Prentice Hall rep. They will however supply the answers to half the exercises in a companion CD called their Cyber Classroom, but that's an additional cost. Which definitely pushes the book into a price range way above most books designed for IT professionals. So if you're required to buy this book for a class, it's a decent textbook, but if you're a professional looking to buy a book to teach yourself Java 2 I feel there are better more cost effective books available."
2,3/2 of this book is informative,"this book is ok till 7th chapter, after 7 ,chapters are getting too complicated,i mean what the f.. are these authors talking about and why dont they just explain them in a simple way?there are lots of examples however!! yea if u can understand, i mean u will really need to spend lots of time on learning the examples, in brief deitel do not know how to really write a book,common fix the chapters from 7!! i also have 2nd edition Walter savitch ;really good compare to deitel"
1,verbose and repetitive junk,"The Deitel's definetely do not have a clue about how to program. Otherwise, how can you write a repetitive book about an object oriented language such as java. This book introduces the novice programmer to java syntax, but does not teach the user good programming style. Much of what is in the book is also available free on line in the java tutorial at Sun. And because the code is so repetive and verbose, the writing suffers from this fallacy as well. I don't recommend wasting your money on this book."
2,Could use better typesetting for accessibility.,"I don't think I need glasses. I regularly print documents at 75% and keep my monitor resolution at 1280 by 1024(20-inch). But with the combination of thick fonts, glossy paper, and no line spacing between paragraphs, the book gives me eyestrain after reading a page or two. The book is best not read under strong florescent lights. (This comment is about the third edition)"
3,Wordy,"This books is extremely wordy. It does not exhaust itself in terms of words. As a beginners book, it's fairly decent, the book assumes that you have little to no java experience. I knew a little bit of java, and therefore reading the book became mundane. The syntax and semantics are well coded, the code is almost ""english"" like. Very, very readable code examples. My biggest gripe is that Applets are taught in the early chapters. I find that to be antithetical, first learn Java coding and OOP because applets fall under that schema of OOP and a solid foundation will make applets easier. A caveat to beginners, remember that this book is wordy, so better pay attention!"
1,"Want a java book, keep looking","This book is awful. They try to make the book for everybody, from beginning to advanced. And I mean everybody. They have a page telling people what the buttons on a browser do. You have to read so many pages that if and when they do get around to talking about something important you might miss it. That is a big if too. I have programed in many other languages so I know what the topics they should be explaining. I felt that many of the topics that should have been were not there. I had many unanswered questions. In addition they don't cover things with enough detail."
2,so so,"the examples aren't using a good programming style, really2x bad programming style. Not too good for a 1st time java programmer. Better for novice"
1,Poor coding practices and poor coverage of advanced topics,"I am an experience java programmer and I have just completed teaching a university sponsored Intro to Java programming course where this book was used as the textbook. If I teach the class again I will not use this book.1. Almost every coding example uses horrible coding practices2. Obsolete and nearly-obsolete classes are discussed and used instead of the newer classes in the latest Java 2 SDK (which the book comes with).3. The coverage of intermediate/advanced topics like Threads, I/O Streams, Collections and Multimedia is so bad its confusing or grossly incomplete.Granted basic Java concepts are covered OK, but once you get past chapter 13 just dump this thing in the garbage."
1,"poor organised , the example codes are too complicated","The author of the example codes just always think of nice GUI. 70%-80% of code in each sample program is only for GUI but have no relationship with the concept it's actually talk about.Worse more, the book always mix lots of concept into a single chapter. For example, for the chapter of ""METHOD"" , it also talk about layout manager, object,applet,event handler,Swing component,etc. What's this chapter actually talk about, merely ""METHOD""?"
4,An easy way to learn Java programming,"I have been trying on and off for the last two and a half years to learn to programme in Java, I found this book in our local Ottakars and have been 'glued' to it ever since. The book is easy to follow and the concepts are clearly laid out. Hopefully I can keep the learning curve going to finish the book and try some projects of my own.!"
2,"Poorly organized, disappointing compare to other Deitel's","I am a student and I bought this book for my first Java class. however, this book is really disappointing and didn't help me out at all except the examples are sometimes useful for my programs. It is also poorly organized and it's like the only way you can learn is to learn from the example code not the author's explanations....Compare to the Deitels C++(not all Deitels books are good!!!), this is really not recommended and of course not worth the money(what 75 bucks?!)I recommend reading the official sun java tutorial site. it's free and it's much more organized and informative."
3,comprehensive but low quality code,"This huge book covers a lot of material, and is good at showing the basics of many, many things. So it is useful. But the code examples are simply not good code. There are ""best practices"" in coding and an instructional book should follow them; this one doesn't."
1,Terrible as a Text Book,"I have some experience programming in Java for real world solutions. I decided to take a junior college course in Java to solidify my understanding of the concepts. This book was the required text for the course and I found it to be a complete waste of money. It seems that the authors spend much of their time asking the reader to mimic code and saying that they'll explain later in another chapter. Then when you come to the so called ""detailed explanations"" they seem to talk in circles. The exercises at the end of the chapters are often related to topics which they've dedicated around 3 lines of text and no code samples - this greatly decreases the entry level Java student's chance of succeeding. This book is an expensive waste of money."
3,Ehh...,"This book is a double-edged blade.On one hand, it's geared toward beginners. It's terrible as a reference, but pretty good for stepping people through the beginnings of programming with java.However, it extensively uses UML, and I think it's a safe assumption that most people who don't know Java, also don't know UML. Looking at UML diagrams can prove to be extremely frustrating for a beginner.I think if the UML were not there, I would recommend this book to any beginner. If you know UML, or if you're willing to skip the UML parts, then you can still learn fairly well from this book.Do not buy it as a reference book though, you'll be very disapointed.The included CD comes with a neat IDE though, so that's nice."
2,Nonremarkable,"Having never read Kay Arthur before, I don't know if it's her common practice to draw so heavily from the Old Testament. But in the case of this book, a lot of the content seems to fall well on the ""judgement"" side (multiple excerpts about stoning people to death who have failed sexually, etc.), rather than the more grace-oriented side. The grace is there--mostly in the latter stages of the book--but you really have to read through a lot of boring and seemingly pointless retellings of OT sexual laws and stories.The counsel offered is mostly biblical and reasoned,... Her heart's in the right place..."
3,PILOT NUMBER ONE,"The first TV pilot of COLUMBO, PRESCRIPTION: MURDER, was broadcasted on Feb. 20th, 1968, more than three years before the broadcasting of the first episode. It's also possible to see this pilot in the DVD standard by purchasingColumbo - The Complete First Season. Gene Barry, the first mean guy who ever confronted Columbo, is mostly appreciated by movie buffs because he starred in two Samuel Fuller films :Forty GunsandChina Gate.We have to accept it: there is a huge difference between this pilot and the Columbo episodes of the first season. For example, PRESCRIPTION: MURDER looks a lot more like a stage play and still belongs to the TV world of the sixties. But there are also in it a few sparkles that announce the grandness of the first episodes. I'm specially thinking here about the scene when Dr. Ray Flemming, a psychiatrist, dissects the way and the recipes Columbo uses with the suspects. This scene alone is worth the 99 minutes of this TV movie.A VHS for the Columbo buffs."
4,"SEASON FOUR, EPISODE ONE","The first episode of this fourth season, AN EXERCISE IN FATALITY, was broadcasted in september 1974. It's also possible to watch this episode in the DVD standard by purchasingColumbo - The Complete Fourth Season. This is the second Columbo episode directed by Bernard L. Kowalski afterColumbo Collector's Edition: Death Lends A Hand, and the third and last episode written by Larry Cohen after the brilliantColumbo Collector's Edition: Any Old Port In A Stormand CANDIDATE FOR CRIME.In this episode, Lt. Columbo must confound the health club owner Robert -Milo Janus- Conrad who murdered Gene Stafford, a man who was about to reveal Milo Janus's frauds. Janus is one of the rare murderers Lt. Columbo doesn't regard with esteem. Hatred is almost tangible between the two characters as soon as they meet.A VHS to keep in your library."
2,"Thick, heavy and ugly: there are better options","These boards are thick and heavy. I don't really like the fact that they can only be used on one side because of the rubber feet. Plus, the wood doesn't look that great. I ended up shelving them for good.There are better options out there, for example theTotally Bamboo Greenlight Utility Board, Medium."
5,Just what I wanted,"This CD was just what I was looking for in order to enjoy listening to one of Elvis' most beautiful songs, Please Don't Stop Loving Me. I got the CD very quickly and at a great price."
3,Why would Amazon sell discontinued products?,"I bought this receiver a couple of months ago. I am generally satisfied with the quality albeit, I was shocked to know that this is a discontinued product! This means, there is virtually no chance of Denon offering any updates/patches on this product.I hold Amazon is high esteem but I am very surprised to find it discontinued products on the catalogue. For couple of hundrer dollars, I could have bought something is HDMI switching right on this website."
5,Legendary!,It's really a nice Product with very good quality. I bought it as a gift for my friend who loves New York because he's been in the states for an year.
5,Love this cap,"Definitely my favorite Yankees cap. I love the whole old-school look that makes this cap look worn out although it's brand spanking new. It simply looks great with just about anything. Only problem is that it's a bit tight(wearing an XL) but otherwise, it's great cap."
5,Happy Yankee Fan,This is one of the most comfortable hats I ever bought. I am thinking of buying a second one.
4,size,"i'm pretty happy with this hat, especially how it's soft and not stiff. what i don't like is that it's a little too shallow for an x-large and doesn't come down to my ears. the other thing, it's a little tight for an x-large. admittedly, i have an x-large head, but this thing is still snug. if i ever wash it i think it won't fit any more. my head, by the way, was 8 3/4 at high school graduation (the last time i measured it).i hope this helps."
1,Not impressed,"I was very upset when this hat arrived. The picture makes it look darker than it really is. I was looking for the closest to black yankee hat I could find, but this picture was very decieving. From now on, I'm shopping at the stores."
4,Bought it as a gift. She loves it.,Bought it as a gift. She loves it. She grew up on Long Island so she wanted to have one for visiting relatives.
1,Piece of junk!,"Pro: Fit in a 125' hoseCon:(1) Does not fit in a 150'hose.(2) Parts do not fit properly and cart is poorly designed: For examples,(a) holes on handle bars, hose reel barrel anchor, and wheels are not aligned for screws to pass through;(b) hose reel barrel anchor is crooked; and(c) screws to secure handle bar are too long and obstruct the hose.(3) Water leaks from brass connectorS.(4) Cannot find part replacements.(5) Wheels do not have brakes, so cart moves constantly when winding or unwinding hose.(6) Cheap 1-layer paint coat.(7) Cart rusts after a few months.(8) Do not carry any warranty."
1,poor quality,I have two of these items. They start rusting immediately and are a mass of rust after a year outside. Only buy this if you want to replece it every two years!
3,Slow-methodical reading,"This book is a requirement for a class I am taking. I find that I need to read everything at least twice to get a clear understanding of what the author is saying. Once I get through it, I know it will be an excellent resource but right now it's just a lot of work."
2,Good..........But.....,I got this for airsofting and i was pretty impressed with it. But for airsofting with glasses or goggles forget it. Unless you get some mesh goggles.Pros.Looks coolComfortablegood protectionConsEye hole is way to big.Airsoft Goggles or Glasses fog up even with defogger.Hard to breathe after wearing it a while.
2,"Looks beautiful, and that's about it.","I live in New Mexico, and I thought this book was going to teach me all I need to know about planting in an unhospitible climate. People have beautiful gardens here, and it's astonishing what flourishes in the dry, hot sun.I'm a novice gardener who plants with a trial and error sensibility. I ask a lot of questions, move plants around, etc. This book didn't help me at all. I found it confusing, lacking in information, and a basic pain in the rear to sort out.I would have given it one star, but the pictures are lovely.Ask a gardener. Leave this book alone."
2,Claims to be for children...,"I bought this based upon its high review rating and its claim to be for children. It does have 8 games. However, it does not provide lessons at a truly beginner level. It's first ""beginner"" lesson assumes you have already had practice with the ""asdfgjkl;"" keys. Learning these 8 keys in the same single lesson is too much for your average 11 and under child. After having done some more research, it looks like ""Typing Pal Junior"" is a better program for beginning children. It teaches two keys at a time, starting with the ""fj"" keys. It also has dictation practice, in the form of stories you have to type as the computer dictates them to you. This provides the added benefit of spelling practice for your child. It only has two games, but the dictated stories make up for it.My children may eventually use Typing Tutor 10, but only after they have worked with Typing Pal Junior for awhile."
4,A Last Glimpse of the Garden of Eden,"Laurens story of the world of the Bushman seen through the eyes of a teenager offers us a glimpse of the ""Garden of Eden"" soon after man eat of the fruit of the tree of life and death.Francois, the teenager, does not have a first hand experience of the Bushman's world. However, through the eyes (and stories) of his nanny (Koba) he gains an appreciation of their values, their spirituality, and of course their way of live. Through the eyes of his father's partners on Hunter's Drift he comes to appreciate (in a practical way) the ways of the bush and the principles governing live in paradise.Sadly by the end of the story paradise has been raped and all its principles violated in man's quest to bring civilization to this place of perfection. Paradise is gone with the wind!"
4,A fascinating tale based on personal experience and history,"Laurens Van der Post has written a very insightful book based on his personal experience during the period of political upheaval in late colonial Africa. It details the transition of a boy into young adulthood at a pace not of his own choosing. The characters are well developed and the descriptions of the plant and animal life of the African veldt are intriguing. This is a book that is hard to put down. You may as well order the sequel, A Far-Off Place, at the same time. You will want to read it as well."
2,No...,"unless you count the author's long-windedness, this story is nothing like the wind.If you're interested in the Bushmen, or if you're simply looking for a good read, you'd be far better served by Elizabeth Marshall Thomas's _The_Harmless_People_ -- her account of actually living with Bushmen in the Kalahari in the early 1950s. (And the later editions include an epilogue, written in the 1980s, in which she has telling things to say about the film ""The Gods Must Be Crazy"" and other popular depictions of Bushmen culture.)"
5,A white boy-man feels the soul and magic of Africa,"I submitted my review anonymously. I would like to lift that anonymity. Lawrence Walker Salt Lake City, Utah"
5,Story Like the Wind,"Here is a tale as intriguing as its title. It moved me as no other book about Africa can. If you loved the little Bushman on ""The Goods Must Be Crazy"", you must read Laurens Van Der Post. The underlying motive in this work is to give you the very great gift of intimacy with the little people of the Kalahari. Van Der Post is so taken with them that his life and life works center around the African Bushman. He leads you to believe that our civilization and each of us personally is missing unbelievable magic in our lives -- magic that is a natural posession of the mystical Bushman. I remain entranced with a new awareness and a deeper sense of our potential, if only we could find our way back to our natural selves. ""Story Like the Wind"" should appeal to almost anyone, from hunters and adventurers to thinkers, romantics and fantasy lovers. If you read it the world will be better for it."
5,One of the best books I've ever read!,"Poetic, prophetic, profound writing and an insight into the culture of Afica that could only be experienced by being there or reading this book."
4,a beautifully written and captivating story,"Van der Post is one of those rare writers who can draw imagination stimulating word pictures about a subject both familiar and foreign. The familiar is the growing of age of a young boy. The foreign is the African setting with its rich native culture. The tension between Western beliefs and values and those of the indigenous people is neatly drawn through the eyes of Francois, a 13 year white, who has grown up in both worlds. Layered on top of that is the seemingly senseless turmoil and blood letting among African tribal groups. I could not put this book down!"
3,Aura by Sainkho Namtchylak,"Sainkho does get monotonous. I think she's run out of steam on this one, but its still interesting and I'm glad to have it. Even so, its a good compilation of her work, though ""Stepmother City"" is better."
5,Lovely Music,"Original Soundtrack from the fantastic Korean 54 episode story recently shown on the Asian Television Network. The music complemented a wonderfully written story about 16th century Korea and the little girl who grew up following her mother's footsteps, first as head lady in the royal kitchen and then as the first woman physician to the king. It is virtually a soap opera with such highs and lows emotionally. There is such joy and sadness. Each episode is like a cliff hanger of old time serials. Not only do I highly recommend the music CD, but also the DVD which is also known as Jewel in the Palace"
5,"A Must Have who watched ""Dae Jang Geum""","I am simply copying and pasting a review by a person whose name is Nicole:it is really about how one remains true to where one started by overcoming one's own greed and desire. The lyrics of the BEAUTIFUL theme song roughly translates into; ""Just because one comes here, one doesn't stay foreve, just because one leaves, one doesn't go away forever."" In my opinion, this IS the real theme of the show, letting it go and humbly accept what's human (high and low of life, birth and death).."
4,Nice soundtrack but room for more.,"I enjoyed listening to this CD, as well as viewing the 54 episodes of this great Korean drama. The music is great, but the CD is 62 minutes long, so there was more room to include some of the other great music tracks from the drama. The CD is just a small sampling of the fantastic music found in the original DVD collection."
2,Light weight,"Not much here to comment on. It appears that very little research was done on these Christmas traditions to write the book, or if there was, the author chose not to let the readers in on it. It book is small and cheaply made."
4,Perfect for lovers of history and the Christmas season,"In this book, author Ace Collins traces the history behind various popular Christmas traditions, from caroling and ornaments to mistletoe and yule logs. Collins provides various theories on the origins of each tradition, some of which date back to even before Christ's birth. He also does a nice job of explaining the rise in popularity of each activity as it moved into the mainstream of Christmas celebrations. Finally, the book carries a strong Christian message, as Collins talks about connecting each modern tradition back to its original roots in commemorating Christ's birth. This is a perfect little book to teach children about the history behind Christmas or for adults looking to find greater meaning in this much-commercialized holiday."
2,One too many,"Aside from milking Vineyard popularity in his rather dull series of mysteries, Craig does not fail to disappoint in this weakest of his offerings. Nothing much happens in this book, the murderer is fairly obvious, and Craig spoon-feeds us dribs and drabs of drama about as riveting as a bowl of mush. Cold mush. As one reviewer noted, there's just too much Zee adoration and Joshua junk. There is very little excitement. Like Martha's Vineyard after the tourists (finally!) go home. I gave this book two stars for the recipes that Craig thoughtfully includes with his stories. Now, if he would only publish his cookbook..."
3,"I'm almost afraid to say ""I liked it!""","The reviews of this simple little book are all over the map. The comments about ""too much Zee / Joshua"" are fair and I agree with them. This edition had a lot less fishing too, thank you very much. The plot was easy to follow and you probably won't be ""guessing"" until the end. But this series is designed for summer reading - a time when your mind should be on autopilot. That means, it should be easy. also, it should be fun and it should be atmospheric. I think Mr. Craig knows that and he has hit on a decent formula that he can use (milk?) until he runs completely out of ideas. I'm reading the series now because it's April and it's still snowing here in the NE. I could use a little Vineyard summer right now and the series continues to bring me back to one of the most beautiful places in the USA. I'll keep reading if he keeps writing because I know what I'm getting."
4,Movie in the Making,"A scouter comes to Martha's Vineyard to select locations for a film of adventure and buried treasure. J.W. Jackson is hired to drive him around, but one of the attractions of the island for the scouter is J.W.'s wife, Zee.J.W. must solve the murder before he is arrested for the crime, as just the day before he and the victim had exchanged blows in front of witnesses and no one else was around when J.W. ""discovered"" the body.The late Philip Craig left cozy mystery fans a great series to read and sample to foods of Martha Vineyard. I have and the will soon appear in on a new web site.Nash Black, author of Indie finalists HAINTS and WRITING AS A SMALL BUSINESS."
2,Didn't get what I ordered,Unfortunatly I got a paperback with a slit in the middle of the front cover when I ordered a new hardback. I was refunded $2.00 and accepted it so I didn't have to go through returning the book and reordering. I still wish I would have gotten the hardback and wish the order just came as it was supposed to as this is a book I plan on keeping.
1,DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT!!!!!,"DO NOT PURCHASE ANY PRODUCTS BY NATURE CLEANSE, THEY DO NOT WORK AND THEY REFUSED TO ISSUE A CANCELLATION ON THE PRODUCT AFTER EVALUATING IT FOR 2 WEEKS LIKE THE AD STATES! THIS IS NOT A LEGIT COMPANY!"
3,"charger compatible, cord was not","Adaptor and uplink cord arrived on time and in good condition. Only issue is that although charger is compatible with many Palms, the charge cable was not compatible with my Tungsten E2. Kept the adaptor and used my own uplink cord."
3,Simone and Rifka,"I am an Orthodox Jewish girl at an Orthodox Jewish school, and I read this book because I am very interested in books about my faith. I think that the author did really well on Simone and her boyfriend and her friend and the friend's boyfriend, and that reminded me of other great teen books I have read, too. I do not think she did as well on the stuff about what it is like to lead a Jewish life. My best friend who is also Jewish has an adopted younger brother and I know that her family really tried to find a Jewish baby in order to adopt it but there were not any. I really do not think that Rifka would have given her baby to a gentile couple unless Rifka hated being Jewish, but she did not! The most interesting parts of the book was the part where Rifka and Simone met for the first time, and the parts about Simone and her boyfriend. There are some plot things that come up fast and then are dropped too fast, like the stuff about the club at school."
4,Beautiful story about finding ones self,"I literally just finished A Brief Chapter in My Impossible LifeBy Dana Reinhardt and had to post about it. I started off not being all that impressed. I purchased it for my middle school library and when I started reading it I felt it was not really appropriate for this age group due to the drinking and sex in the beginning. The more I read though the more I enjoyed the book. Although I would not suggest it to the younger middle schoolers, I think it would be a great book for students 14 and up. It would be especially appropriate for anyone who has dealt with adoption.It is a beautiful story of family and finding one's self. It also does a great job of including lessons on Judism without turning the book into ""Jewish Book"". The story brought me to tears without being morbidly sad saccharine sweet. I would give this book a 4 1/2 out of 5 stars."
1,Christian Bashing,"This book amounts to Christian bashing. The only Christian in the story is a fanatic. Everyone else is either agnostic, atheist or Jewish and they are all portrayed as intelligent, insightful and balanced. When a Jewish character recites Jewish prayers and sings religious songs, the atheists are awestruck. Meanwhile one atheist character spends two full pages explaining that Christmas is no longer a Christian holiday, but a secular one for everyone to celebrate. Perhaps Reinhardt is assuaging her own conscience for indulging in the joys of a Christian holy day that celebrates the birth of Jesus.I don't see how it is acceptable to bash Christians and Christianity when the equivalent targeting any other religion would not be tolerated for a moment.I will not recommend this book to any patrons."
5,Quercetin the greatest.,"I have taking been three JARROW quercetin caps per day and have great energy. When I had to miss it for two weeks due to being too busy, I got back into the old way of feeling not able to do anything. After my second order and back on the caps for about 4 or 5 days I felt great again. Even have dropped one of my breathing meds and my Dr. said "" go girl go"".. I feel wonderful. M. Norris"
3,Ansir,"3 Sides of You helps you identify your 3 of your dominant personality styles in Thinking, Working, and Emoting categories.The idea is to help you understand how you think, work, and love. You take a series of 3 self-perception tests, and then read the types that result. If they don't match, check the test, you are asked to type yourself--the results are dependent on you.If you want to give this a try before you buy, you can try out a limited version of the test at Ansir.com, at the very least, I can tell you you'll enjoy giving it a try."
5,Pieces of Intelligence,"This is a ""must have"" book!!! If you've watched the Pentagon/Dept. of Defense briefings before, you will definitely want to own this book! It is a real hoot to re-live some of the spoken words of ""Rummie""!"
4,What are we coming to?!!!,"Ok, folks. Let's just get this straight. This book is not meant to glorify the clown otherwise known as our Secretary of Defense. The ""poetry"" is meant to draw attention to the fact that Secretary Rumsfeld's public comments are vague, misleading, and unintelligible. Some of the reviews on this site seem to suggest that Rumsfeld is actually an aspiring poet. Others seem to think that author Hart Seely is a fan of the current administration. It is a shame that this clever book is too far over the heads of the American public to make its point."
5,I haven't read this but...,"...I had to correct the last reviewer: Donald Rumsfeld is our Secretary of Defense, not our Secretary of State (that's Colin Powell)."
1,Not worth the lowest coin in the realm.,I just recently received this pulp as a misguided gift. I've also noticed that used copies are now selling for a penny. That's a sad state of affairs indeed - because this pulp isn't worth the lowest coin in the realm.
4,Absolutely hilarious...,"Since we can't believe anything that comes out of the man's mouth, at least we can have some fun with his bizarre ramblings..."
1,I've endured him on T.V.;now he's being offered in print,"It is important for anyone tempted to buy this book to wake up to the reality that Hart Seely's collection of Rumsfeldisms pawned off as what one reviewer characterized as Donald Rumsfeld's ""Zen poetry"" is really nothing more than an author's worshipful repackaging of a dogmatic, narrow view of the world being marketed in a way that tries to make Rumsfeld's arrogant, reactionary world view seem more palatable. Don't waste your hard earned money."
1,You've got to be kidding.,"I honestly feel sorry for anyone that actually took this seriously. Why don't you try reading a REAL book? You know, one with words in it that have more than one syllable."
3,RELAX,"First of all, anyone who does take this book seriously is crazy. Secondly, have any of you out there heard of irony? The point of this book is to mock Rummy,not cheer him on! So when reading this ""book of poetry"", please don't forget the grain of salt--and a sense of humour."
3,A must for any Bon Jovi fan,"This is a good solid cd for any Bon Jovi fan. Diamond Ring is one of my favorites and it is actually a very old song. I heard it on the radio one time just before the I went to see them in concert during the New Jersey tour. I fell in love with the song and never heard it again until they put out this cd. I would have bought the CD for that song alone. I like the slower songs on this cd - This Ain't A Love Song, Lie To Me, It's Hard Letting You Go. This CD lacks a ""Power Rock"" song, there's no Livin' On A Prayer or You Give Love a Bad Name equivalent, These Days is the only fast song that I find catchy. I am looking forward to their new album and tour. I am so there! Bon Jovi rules!"
5,In my opinion - the BEST Bon Jovi album out there!,"I am a huge fan. I love all their stuff from the 80's to the 90's.... I'll admit: their new album Have a Nice Day is pretty crappy. Bounce wasn't all that great either. However, These Days is a perfect CD. Every song is written incredibly, the lyrics are thoughtful, and the song quality in general is very high. Funny too because this album didnt really have any hit singles, yet it is so amazing.. says something about just how good Bon Jovi is. Anyways, listen to this album. It's their best. You won't be disappointed.I just wish reviewers would comment on the ""remastered"" aspect of this particular album, since I only have the original and would like to know how this remastered version sounds."
5,One of the Best Bon Jovi CD'S EVER!,"This cd was great, unlike others the lyrics really touched me. I could relate to almost ever song, like ""Something to Believe in"" and ""These Days"" are some of my favorite songs that I'll never get tired of! I would recamend this CD to anyone and everyone! Trust me on this one, this CD is a real winner!"
3,Not as good as previous albums,"This is the first album where Bon Jovi fans knew the magic of previous albums was starting to disappear. For some reason the band also decides to talk over the start of a lot of songs on this album which might have seemed the in thing to do at the time but has dated extremely quickly and is pretty annoying every time you want to listen to a track.There are some great songs such as Something For the Pain, These Days, All I want is Everything and Something to Believe In. There are some terrible songs on here as well though such as This Ain't A love Song (they released this as a single), My Guitar Lies Bleeding in My Arms and Diamond Ring.The other songs on the album are listenable to but nothing great. I guess this is why Bon Jovi released Cross Road their greatest hits album before they made this album as they knew the great album days were over. If you can get this for a good price buy it but I wouldn't pay full price for it."
5,"Bon Jovi's Best Album, Even Better","THESE DAYS, which is already Bon Jovi's best album, is even better remastered. The band sounds here like East Jersey's answer to all the great Southern rock bands of the 70s, which is not surprising when you consider Jon Bon Jovi's belief, shared with those bands, that the young Australian tourist jailed in Indonesia for drug-smuggling was unjustly convicted, which, along with his advocacy of increased funding for law enforcement, makes this album an essential purchase for both your ears AND your conscience."
3,first half good second half bad,the first 6 song are great . then it fall a part. the second half is so sad. over all this is a good cd from bon jovi.
2,DISGUSTING,"Bon Jovi, you're a money lover. AFter selling more than 10 million copies of ""KEEP THE FAITH"" and ""NEW JERSEY"", you were not satisfied: you destroyed the soul of the band in order to get moire commercial songs and make more money.. It'á shame..."
1,so sad,these days is the worst bon jovi cd. these days is so sad I can not understand why people like this cd. please stay away from this one. all the others bon jovi cd are great. so get one of them .
1,disappointed with the lyrics,I have been a fan of Bon Jovi's for 18 years and I just recently bought this CD. I hated to read the lyrics of Hey God. How sad to know that Jon and the boys may have felt or still feel this way. They are a great band and good guys. I would hate to think that they still feel this way. Needless to say I got rid of the CD and will stick to all the others I have.
5,Always a pleasure.,It's always a pleasure to hear Bon Jovi.This was no exception! Classic rock never goes out of style and you would really enjoy this CD.
1,Inept,"Chapter One says it all. This is a litany of ineptitude by an acknowledged master in the field. Beyond the typographical errors and linguistic mistakes, which point to the author's lack of familiarity with any of the relevant languages needed for the work, there are major undergraduate-level mistakes. Cairo's Al-Azhar is not known as a Wahhabi institution ... And how can anybody (or anybody's editor) claim that 15 percent of Cham Buddhists are Wahhabi? This would be like asserting that 15 percent of Hindus are members of Opus Dei. Caveat emptor."
5,Essential Reading,"This is a fascinating book that examines the Southeast Asian terrorist network in chilling detail. It is highly readable, yet filled with data and information. It is essential reading for all those interested in Southeast Asian terrorism,and to understand how Al Qaeda has morphed."
5,Suffering makes sense-A postmodern classic,"I would like to strongly recommend this book to all. It handles the hard question in a very sober and inspiring way and even humorously :-). Kreeft has not the role of an excathedral theologian or philosopher. No, he is a philosopher in the true sense. Majeneutics, the Socratic method of philosophical dialogue, is mixed with reflexions. The author points out and by hints lets the reader find the answer. He is a seeker, voyager and a challenger like we all. Like any good voyager he has his common sense and lot of experience as compass and ofcourse lot of professional knowledge and wisdom. Thouse of us who luck it or can not structure our life-experiences should read this humble and beautifull creation of a genius. Suffering makes sense. AMDG"
5,One of the Best Books on the Topic,"Eschewing easy answers, Peter Kreeft calls us to explore the mystery of suffering. Examining the thoughts of philosophers, artists, and prophets, he shares clues to the why of suffering. This culminates in Jesus, ""the one who would solve the problem of suffering by suffering, who would solve the problem of death by dying, and in so doing transform the meaning of suffering and death.""People of our day think feeling good is the ultimate objective, and therefore see suffering as an incredibly bad thing. But when you realize the ultimate objective is the glory of God, suffering is truly a momentary light affliction. Peter Kreeft helps us understand that."
4,Welcome Back!,"Not that they've been away, but it seems a lifetime since the two time pop sensation I'm Gonna Be stirred my spirit. Sure there's been a couple of discs inbetween but nothing seems to stick quite like the undeniably catchy Hate My Love. In fact their are several tracks that keep me pushing replay. When Charlie cries out ""You meant it then..."" behind Craig I want to run down the street kissing everyone. This album is a gem amidst the slew of corporate muck that we are inundated with during the first half of the year. Not content being a nostalgic act, they write of mid-life woes and joys yet manage to make it sway. I'm grateful they're grateful."
2,A bit disappointing.,"Matt Dusk is indeed a skilled singer, but there is very little here that grabs the listener and refuses to let go. The Bono-penned ""Two Shots of Happy, One Shot of Sad"" is a keeper, but the rest is rather bland.You can certainly hear the talent in Dusk's vocal offerings, but you just don't feel the emotion. Hopefully his next effort will truly show us what this young crooner is made of."
1,Nothing Original Here! Very mediocre.,"I keep waiting for a new artist to come along and release some new 'standards'. This isn't it. Matt Dusk is mediocrity personified. Nothing but the same old songs that we have heard for decades. Nothing new, nothing original, nothing but BORING."
2,A snoozer... zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,"I found this album for 2 bucks at a Goodwill. I tried to listen to the whole thing once. Not sure if I made it all the way through. Matt's competent, and has a pleasant voice. But there just isn't any excitement or risk. His notes are accurate and consistent, but never quite impress. There has to be an emotional connection with every song, a story being told, a drama that the artist creates and shares with the audience every time. Matt is technically smooth, but I don't know what he's feeling, if anything. I love jazz music and standards, but this album is just a snoozer all the way through. I can find five different versions of any one of these standards that I know would awe me, touch my heart, and blow my mind. I can listen to Ella, Nina Simone, Nat King Cole, Sinatra, Vic Damone, Jimmy Roselli, Sinatra, Tony Bennett, Streisand, Betty Buckley, name your own favorite. Why would I want to listen to Matt Dusk?"
3,Two Shots could use a few more shots.,Dusk nearly does it on this compact disc although there's no pizzaz no spark as far as I'm concerned. On tv live he was more endearing to me.
2,let down,"dusk was compared to cincotti and buble, and i gave him a try but he is lacking some emotion and feeling.his voice is pleasant, song choices may be stale, but there is nothing on this cd that jumps out at me."
5,The Best Since Sinatra,"If anyone is contemplating on buying this CD, please do not hesitate. Its one of the greatest CD's made and Matt Dusk is awesome. A quick rising star since Sinatra and the voice to prove it. I saw him in person and he is great. Love this music and would buy again from him. Please, get this CD, you won't be sorry. A++++++ MATT DUSK IS THE BEST."
2,Dusk dips down in my books.,"I had great expectations after following him on tv, and sadly I'm disappointed in this.I'm not sure why he doesn't hit me with this cd, but it just falls a little flat.I mean if Rod Stewart can get it..."
5,Fabulous,After watching the first episode of the casino on Fox I knew that I had to find Matt Dusk's CD. If you like the rat pack and old jazz you'll love Matt Dusk. Listening to his music is like going back in time. Absolutely Fabulous!
2,"Two shots of Sinatra, one shot of Sinatra = Sinatra Clone","I was very disappointed in this CD. After reading the reviews (""breath of fresh air"" etc.) I was expecting someone original and new. But unfortunately, there's nothing new on this CD in terms of style and delivery that you can't get from Sinatra CDs. And I'm seriously not exaggerating when I say he sounds *exactly* like Frank. It's uncanny. Also, while he has a very good voice and is obviously well-trained, most of his tracks are lacking emotion. Everything is technically excellent, but nothing really grabs you."
5,INCREDIBLE FOR ONE SO YOUNG,"It took me a while to find this album, but it was worth the effort. Great voice, great music & excellent production - but then I like the kid."
5,Wowee!,"Not since Michael Buble came on the scene recently have I heard such a voice. Matt Dusk has that classic swing/jazz voice that'll make all the dames swoon! It's clear, soft and grabs your attention immediately. The first time I heard it was passing quickly past it on television and I frantically reversed the channels in the hopes of finding it again. The next day I went out and bought the single. Keep 'em coming Matt! I'll keep buying!"
4,Sexy voice,"This album is incredible. It has the sound of old times and great singers like Sinatra, but with new songs. It's definately one of the better albums of its kind. Matt's very soulful when he sings, it comes from his heart. He makes the songs sexy because of his one of a kind voice and he gives the songs his own little touch.I definately recommend this album to anyone is enjoys the sounds of smooth sensational music."
3,One shot of disappointment...,"I had been eagerly anticipating the release of Two Shots for some time after hearing Matt Dusk on a jazz compilation. When it finally arrived, I popped it into my CD player and listened to the album twice - from beginning to end.While I love the richness and texture of Matt Dusk's voice, his phrasing and singing at times were a bit shakey - like he was trying to hard for Sinatra-esque swing and swagger. I found some of the original compositions to be a bit schmaltzy, the interpretation of 'Please, Please Me' to be grating, and the dance remix to be completely unnecessary.Perhaps, this is a CD to be put away on a shelf and re-discovered at a latter date. Regardless, I look forward to Dusk's 2nd album because it can only get better."
3,Judging a book by it's cover.,"Good looking Matt Dusk disappointed me with this cd. With his picture and the title Two Shots I had anticipated something much better. The voice is ok, but the style just doesn't seem suited for him. I judged a book by it's cover and I shouldn't have."
3,Has a style of his own but far from matching Sinatra's,"Matt Dusk is a good singer with a voice that has a neutral effect on you. It is not the type of talent that gives you goose bumps. Some of the reviewers do not have musically-tuned ears to make a judgment about his talent. If you want to hear music that makes you say ""WOW!"" at the end of every song, you can simply listen to the real thing: Sinatra that is!"
2,Eastern Sandalwood,The container is cute but i thought it would smell better. Disappointed! I would not tell my friends about this.
4,Excellent product!,"The scent is very nice! I would recommend this for people who enjoy natural, earth scents. My only disappointment is that the item isn't threaded, so the top just sits on the bottom...I have almost dropped the bottom part by picking up by the top. Other than that I really like this product."
4,Pretty much what was expected.,"The product was delivered in a few days from purchase and was boxed in original packaging with a safety seal around the container for security. The stone holder is really nice, I'll probably keep it for decoration or other uses and the perfume solid was fresh, though I would describe the smell more like ""clean powder"" or baby powder than anything smokey or exotic. It isn't a screw on top so you can't really travel with it, but, for the money, I think its a decent buy."
5,Rare Insight Into the Implications of Quantum Physics,"Quantum Physics is interesting in-and-of-itself, but equally or more interesting are the implications of quantum physics with respect to other subjects such as mind, consciousness, philosophy, theology, biology, and cosmology, just to name a few.Dr. Swanson's detailed as well as implied overview on all of the above is quite rare if not non-existant in most books under one cover. The mysteries which quantum physics presents are not any 'further- out' than the 'far-out' conclusions Dr. Swanson presents as a physicist, (with respect to paranormal events in this world). His book explains many things which demand explaining through physics. It is impossible to lay his his book, ""The Syncronized Universe"" aside.Respectfully,Jim HoyGreen valley, Arizonacnjhoy@cox.net"
3,Starship Creator Add-on Pack,"You don't get to controll any of the missions, but you can personalize your own style, strength, and other features of many different ships. Not an action game."
4,this is a great show but the dvds are lacking,"First off, season four is perhaps the best season of the show period. The plotlines were creative, the jokes were incredibly smart, the acting was amazing, and the show was just really in it's sitcom niche. That said, these DVD sets are taking way too long to come out and then are quite expensive for the lack of features on them. I for one do not even consider the ""themed featurettes"" a special feature as they're pretty much a clip show. It is nice to see the inclusion of outtakes, but I'd much rather see some behind the scenes stuff! I keep hoping that with each DVD release we'll see things getting better, but it's just not happening. However, this season's DVD set is MUCH better than season 3, except for the menu screens."
3,Please help,"I'm enjoying the episodes, but I'm having this really weird experience. There are supposed to be 6 episodes on each disc, but for some reason, the menu on my discs show only three on each! Does anyone have any idea of what's going on here??"
5,I love it,Will & Grace is one of my favorite shows and it will continue to be even when it ends next year. I bought the 1st season when it came out but after that I decided I would wait till the series ends so that way I could buy the box set whenever it comes out. It will have 8 seasons in it probably costing about $100 and something.
3,Sour Note,"Season 4, like all of this show's seasons, is very funny. The show has never needed its guest stars to be entertaining, and has been the only sitcom to ever successfully you guests stars (repeatedly) without diminshing the roles of the stars in the episodes and seemlessly putting them into an episode.This is a show I did not watch on live TV, got hung up on it during reruns so picked up the DVDs. It is a great show, but sadly this season ends on a sour note. Forgetting it's a comedy, we watch Karen and Jack have dreams crushed, and Will and Grace think about having a baby together and disappointing each other - - only to roll into next season with Will angry at Grace when she finally meets Mr. Right.Ultimately, the Season is worth the sad end; I only hope Season 5 has a quick redemption."
1,How Does This Show Keep Going?,"I used to think that MASH had the longest span of seasons that weren't funny. But at least it had some good seasons before it jumped the shark and Alan Alda turned into the War Is Hell Show over and over again.I've seen WILL & GRACE shows from the beginning up to now, and they are not funny. You can't even fly cross country without having to sit through at least one episode anymore. And they're still not funny.WILL & GRACE is the only show I know that jumped the shark the second it started."
4,Will and Grace Season 4,"Well, i LOVE will and grace, this season was really great. I loved it and i plan to buy all past and upcomming seasons. I'm not gonna sit here and give you all the episodes and a discription, because other people will do that. I actually have a life. :) Anyway the point is that this is a very solid investment. When i first got it i watched it at least once a day for like 2 weeks. So its good. :)"
4,Great the series gets better but wheres the special features,Season four was the last great season of Will and Grace. This season we see more grown up charactors. Jack is better then ever and Karen is better then ever. Will is great but Grace starts to moop around to much and complain. The story's are good and funny but I hate the story line with Will and Grace wanting to have a baby. Again where are the special features. Sadley aftetr this season the show started to go down hill it was still funny but not as funny as the begging of the series.
3,The standards have fallen from season 2,"I don't know what went wrong, but this show isn't funny by this season. Now, you end up watching it for the story and not realising that there are no laughs. Every now and again when the characters 'push political/sexual barriers' the audience shreaks and howls - is that what this top-notch show has come to?"
1,An annoying show,"Maybe this show appeals to some people, but to me the characters seem like a bunch of annoying, whiny retards. I can't stand the voices of the main actors - two of them shriek rather than talk. Rather than provide comedy that everybody can enjoy, Will & Grace revolves around cliches and gay sex jokes. Debra Messing is the only salvation in the show, but she's not enough to save bad comedy."
4,Describes Early Generation Handicapping Programs,"This book was written ten years ago, so don't expect a description of modern computers and software. The book is a tutorial for writing a simple program in the software language BASIC for picking horses. At the end, he tests the program and it does okay. He also gives a computerless system which can be done with a handheld calculator. The book is a good insight to the fundamental approach of selecting and weighting handicapping factors, although today's techniques are more rigorous. The book was updated in 1999 after the initial publication in 1995. This would be an excellent book for a youngster getting started in programming, with an interest in BASIC and horses, unfortunately I don't even know that any one uses BASIC anymore!"
3,A mediocre math book,"My daughter used this book last year, and I spent many an evening in it with her. The book uses multiple methods to introduce each concept, but, ends up confusing rather than helping. The problems provide a good review of all the material to master in each chapter. Unfortunately, the explanations don't get you ready to do the problems. By the end of the year, we both felt cheated."
3,Middle School Math -Course 2,"My daughter is using this book and I have been frustrated with the way the concepts are presented and the numerous areas they cover with examples, which confuse the children.The authors forgot their audience. Does a 11 year old need to know about stocks/NYSE, investment managers like in Chapter 4??? Or how about use of GCFs and LCMs in Warehouse Management (chapter 3-7). It is an overwhelming book. My husband and I ( respectively a chemist and an engineer) are taking turns helping our daughter to conquer this book. Such a turn off book for kids."
2,Not a favorite,"There's isn't much of a story to this repetitive book. Sure, there's lots of animals in this zoo and they all 'look back' at the main character after she looks at them, but it's not enough to make it interesting. My 2 and 4 year old weren't impressed and they LOVE books."
1,"Baby got a ""smack""?","Not only did my kids seem very bored by this book, but I was a little disturbed that one of the very few suggestions of activity was a mother monkey ""smacking"" her baby."
4,Outstanding for its time,"Contemporary readers may not be as impressed with this biography as they ought to be, as it has been so influential that its conclusions have been widely adopted by subsequent historians. As a result, this book should be read in conjunction with a more recent biography. However, keeping in mind how old the book is, it is still a classic, and Bullock's writing is a pleasure to read."
3,Good for starting out,"Bullock is one of the most well-known of Hitler's biographers, and that for a reason. The UNABRIDGED version of this book is, however, a much better choice and a more interesting read as well. Compared with others (Kershaw, Fest, Maser, etc) this abridged volume comes up short."
3,HITLER - A STUDY IN TYRANNY : ABRIDGED VERSION,"I enjoyed the book very much as an amateur historian and read it often, so much so that my original copy fell apart over the years.The book itself compares well with Shirer's 'Rise and Fall of The Third Reich', which I personally consider to be 'the bible' as regards the Nazi era.The abridged version of 'Study in Tyranny' I found a bit dis-appointing after having the original, full text edition as the bench mark. I found there was, naturally, some parts of the text absent and that was dis-concertiong plus the larger print of the new version was a shade off-putting.My paperback edition of Shirer's work is full text, with naturally smaller print, but it is the full magnum opus, which is also an overweight Irish cat.I fully commend 'Hitler, A Study in Tyranny' to the student of The Third Reich but I would re-commend you purchase the full length version to gain the best from this work."
5,Excellent book,"This book was one of the assigned books for my Hitler + Nazi Germany class. It was excellent, although I'd prefer it if it were the original (unabridged) version."
4,Like new!,"This book is in A-1 shape, no bent pages, stains, markings, etc. Would definitely order from vendor again."
2,Forget it,"If you want to find out about how great the ideas of Noam Chomsky are and how badly mistreated he has been by his critics, this is the book for you. If you really want to learn something about what is known about the biological basis (bases?) of language look somewhere else."
1,not appropriate for my car like it said!,"This item seemed like a good fit for what I needed for my car (2005 Jetta). My original gas cap had a crack in the seal and was making the check engine light come on every time i turned on the car. I searched on amazon and the item had a check list at the top to make sure that the item would fit the vehicle you were buying it for. This extra feature DID NOT WORK. I don't know if that's Amazon's fault or the sellers, but I was very disappointing to find out that Jetta's have a ventilation system in the car so that the gas cap does not need to be self ventilating. Needless to say it was a waste of money and the 6 dollar shipping that they charged me. Be careful with check list if it tells you the item will be a fit for your car.. it still may not be what you need."
4,Fits a 1998 Golf,"Works great on a 1998 Golf. No cable, but that was expected. Works well for what it is, a gas cap."
3,Strapless,Great little cap and fits like a charm. Made in Mexico but it still works. Don't have a strap/leash to keep it from getting lost in case you forget to put it back on but................!!!??
4,Its a gas cap.,"Not a ton to say here, its a gas cap and significantly cheaper on Amazon than other more VW oriented stores. Fits just fine on my 2000 VW Jetta. Only thing missing (and the reason for one star short) is some easy way to connect a rubber leash to it like the original.\Peter"
1,dvd does not work keep getting disc error,"well got video as a gift for my dad, dvd does not work in any of our dvds players. tried calling was hung up on 2wice got thru the 3rd time was told i couldnt return it. so I am stuck with the dvd that does not work and from what i read it is in spanish that doesnt help m either so thank u"
4,Minor Leagues Yield Major Talent,"Those who enjoy the passion that enters a community when minor league baseball first makes its entrance will enjoy Bob Roth's book. What comes across is a hopefilled book-the hope that baseball brings to a community and the hopes of the minor league players who carry the torch of someday playing in the major leagues. The author proves to be a bit of a prophet as many of the players who made their debut with the initial Lansing Lugnuts now make their homes in the major league and the continuing success of the Lugnuts franchise is a major contributor to the revitalization of the Lansing community. If you love your baseball...and would enjoy a look at some of the ballplayers who rarely receive much ink, you'll enjoy reading this book!"
5,View this novel as a gripping cautionary tale!.,"It is often said that those who ignore the lessons of history are apt to repeat them. This book should be compulsory reading for the young and those who are wont to thoughtlessly follow others in political protest. This novel, loosely based in Castro's Cuban Revolution, demonstrates how mob psychology and injustice can be [done]to serve the ends of an unscrupulous leader and his cause. It also demonstrates how human nobility can rise triumphantly despite threats of death and annihilation. It paints a credible picture of a regime that craftily exploits the emotions, inexperience and gullibility of the young who idealistically seek after (perfection, peace, nirvana?) on earth. This is an intriguing novel threaded through with vital lessons we all need to be reminded of in our haste to attain a quick (""peace"") fix/resolution of political woes."
4,Rockin' Blues made in Canada,"Guitar-Slinger Carson Downey goes ""all the way"" on this rocking Blues-CD. Until now this trio was probably Canada's best kept Blues-secret. That might change with this nice effort - I'm waiting for more."
5,EXCELENT!!!!!!!,Its a great manga. The best i had ever read. I think Clamp are a great artist and I love their style!!!! n_n
1,Not Rayearth II,This is NOT Rayearth II Book 2. It is Rayearth I Book 2. It is also not a right to left manga. It is left to right
4,Alrigh,"I ordered this because I have fertility issues and alot of research I have done pointed me in the direction of Maca Root. The product seemed to help right off. I noticed my energy and CM. I do think it helped with energy a little, but I'm not positive. I have been taken it for about 2 1/2 weeks and the only negative side effect I have noticed is that It can give me an upset stomach if I don't eat with it."
1,stomach cramps,I respect Natures Way brand but having Non cooked/prepared Maca is not suitable for me and others as I have read this gives stomach cramps and bloating to the stomach. I experience this for myself
5,"Wardlaw's Short Story, The Snowstorm, Excellent","This collection by some of America's best short story authors contains an excellent variety. Dont Go Near the Stove is funny and imaginative. Wardlaw's The Snowstorm kept me on the edge of my seat. In fact, he has a book coming soon, Dracul-The Vampire Returns, published by Publish America, Books. It is as well written as The Snowstorm. If you like Horror and Vampires, this is not one to miss. Keep them comming."
2,iSight Camera light,Not very good. Light intensity on subject not as expected. Subject still appears dark using only Griffin Sightlight during video conferencing. Additional room lighting still needed.
1,Looks cool w/ iSight but is a huge disappointment,"What you're paying for is the same thing as a cheap 40-watt desk lamp that can hardly light up a face in a dark room! Not only does the light hardly work, but the light casts you in a weird blue complexion, even in a well lit room. The ambient light sensor sounds like a good idea but doesn't really work that well (the light comes on even while in relatively well-lit rooms). Despite all of these shortcomings, the SightLight is very easy to install. Bottom line....Use an exsiting lamp or buy a cheap one on ebay."
1,Anemic disappointment,The lights are weak LEDs and don't do much at all. Don't waste your money on this one.
1,Don't waste your money...buy the program iglasses instead.,Bought this because it was supposed to light up your face so people could see you easier using iSight. It doesn't do anything unless you are within a foot of it. It is worthless and should be pulled from the shelves.
2,"Disappointing, throws off color balance","I had high hopes for this product. After all, every video chat benefits from extra light, right? Unfortunately, this product is only beneficial in absolutely darkness. Its illumination is so weak that it's virtually impossible to detect any difference under normal office lighting.Chances are that you will be using iChat AV with your iSight. And the blueish white light this product gives off completely upsets iSight's automatic white balance. Caucasian skin will have an unnatural pink or magenta tinge to it (like you have high blood pressure!) as the iSight will get confused between your office light, any daylight and the blue/white LEDs that power this light. Also the LEDs are very piercing and difficult to look at... not the soft glow needed from such a product. I guarantee you will squint everytime you look into your iSight with this light on.Unless you need to videoconference in pitch black rooms or outdoors at night, I would avoid this product."
1,SiteLight,I recently bought a sitelight from my local Apple Store. Its now on its way back to the store because it basically does nothing- there is so little light emitted that you might as well hold a lighter in front of your face- you'd get better results.
1,a total waste of money!,"Worked marginally for the first month. Light works only at close distance (you have to be 12 from the light source). Then the fire wire connection failed. The light works on it's own, but not in conjunction with the iSight Camera. I've tried it with another camera and computer and conclude that the fire wire link is faulty. It's past the 30 day warranty so apparently I have no recourse. It's a lousy product and the Amazon return policy is inadequate."
1,STAY FARAWAY --- FAR FAR AWAY!!!!,"This light offers no extra lightSeriously - you could buy a small desk lamp for a much cheaper price, and it will provide you with MUCH better and more effective lightingTHe SightLight does look cool in a way though --- so if you need the cool factor, then go for it"
1,Read the bible for the truth,"Since there is no scripture that proves that there will be a rapture before the tribulation, this book may not be presenting the truth. My advice if you want to know the truth, read the bible and let the Holy Spirit show you the truth and be prepared for whatever way the future turns out.Anyway, do we really need another end time prophecy book? Let's face it, no one knows how the future will turn out but God and most prophecy books are just speculation.The Rapture Ready message board is also a very censored board and does not allow different opinions to be spoken, only the ones that they agree with. Different views are quickly suppressed. Too bad, it could have been a great Christian site to share the truth."
1,Only the Tip of the Strandberg !,"Yes, read Todd's new book. And read items on his ""Rapture Ready"" site. And read ""OPEN LETTER TO TODD STRANDBERG"" (on most search engines). But read fast. Time's running out. The rapture will happen without warning. If you don't read this review fast enough, something may happen right while you are reading about the rap....!"
1,DISAPPOINTED,"Book is biased to the authors religious views, is not an unbiased presentation of information on the subject and is a shameless promotion for their other fictional novels as it contains numerous excerpts from the Left Behind novels."
1,"Would love to sell these, but...","Unfortunately, these tuners are not ATSC (Digital) and therefore cannot be used in most of the world now. Not sure why people are still trying to sell them. Buyers, beware."
3,Not an Original Sound Track (OST),Ave Maria on this CD is NOT from the original sound track. It is a different arrangement and singer than what was on the original DVD drama. If you are expecting the original sound track look elsewhere. This CD is the re-recorded Japanese version. The other tracks sound pretty good though.
5,SWEET SONGS FOR YOUR HEART,"If u've seen this mini serie/soap opera, korean drama , you know why i say sweet songs for your heart. This 2003 serie was a truly love story and it had the most amazing music in it. Here u have some songs that come in this cd, such as the opening song called ""Bo Go Ship Da"" by Kim Bum soo. Another one is ""Na Man Eh Nuh"" by Kim Hyun Ah. this one is instrumental.And another one that drives me crazy is ""chun gook eh gi uk"" by Jang Jung Woo. And more tracks. If u are gonna ask me what that means.. yeah i dont know. But i do know that ""bo go ship da"" is ""missing you"" and its a very sad song. If u are familiar with this serie then you will know this music. I totally recomend this.Dont forget the name of the serie is called ""Stairway to heaven"" (Escalera al cielo) and it's about a triangle love, the stars are Cha Song-ju: Kwon Sang Woo, Han Jung-suh: Choi Ji Woo , Han Tae-hwa: Shin Hyun Joon, Han Yuri: Kim Tae Hee among others."
4,A GOOD SAMPLE OF HER EARLY DAYS,"Being a fan of FRANCE GALL,i found out that almost all she recorded between 1962 and 1968 with a few exceptions is quite good, even if FRANCE herself has not fond memories of that time.It is quite obvious today that FRANCE GALL was the first of the so called LOLITA type of singer.This collection does a good job .All the hits are there including SACREE CHARLEMAGNE (her least favorite),POUPEE DE CIRE,POUPEE DE SON and my favorite LES SUCETTES with a double meaning lyric to match.All of FRANCE GALL 's early recordings have been reunited on a 4 cd collection.Thank God!There is only one FRANCE GALL, beware of imitators."
5,"You will love this ""Tour de France"" because it's real France","Melodies are just beautiful. Voice is exquisite. Everything is ""typically french"" here. France's father was Robert Gall, a composer whose ""La Mama"" song for Charles Aznavour became one of the greatest hits of the century in France."
3,Tasty but you might want to consider...,"I purchased these in a twelve pack and actually found them a sweet delight. (If you don't want a sweet treat, I would advise you not to purchase anything stated to include honey, one of the sweetest items known to man.)However, I must include a note of warning. Some of the nuts can be very hard to crunch into. Seriously, if you have weak teeth, some of the peanuts are so coated as to be like hard candy and can do some serious dental damage if not careful."
4,I'm addicted,I really enjoy these nuts. These are the best honey roasted peanuts around. I also like the small container since the larger container would often go stale before I finished the contents. Good for a picnic or a road trip. I also like taking them in to the theater.
1,disappointed,"i love honey roasted peanuts,but the honey roasted i thought i was buying is the sugar coated nuts.these are candy or toffey coated nut honey roasted.i'm not sure why they are called honey roasted.i did'nt get what thought i was getting."
1,Toffee Peanuts--Emerald Universally Lousy,"I can see the appeal of these honey roasted peanuts since they have 3x the salt and sugar of other brands, but for me the salty-sweetness was excessive, leaving a burning sensation in my throat. These peanuts contain almost 30% sugar by weight, and the sugar and corn syrup annihilate the honey flavor that I appreciate in other brands. I also found several small and one large chunk of peanutless coating in my container, forcing me to watch out lest I end up with a mouthful of sugar. While these might be a replacement for a candy bar, the low peanut content (only 3.2oz) makes them expensive, and the chunks of coating make them defective.A two-star product: I over-correct for the perfect reviews of the sugar-fiends."
5,"Rory had great ""Taste"".","I first heard Taste in about July of '69 and have been hopelessly addicted since. I coaxed a neighbor friend into buying the 1st lp and I learned it by heart, in fact it molded my whole 'taste' of blues and how it relates to rock. On The Boards came out shortly after but I did not get a copy for a few years. Regardless of the delay, I consider it a brilliant showcase of RGs best effort to date. I echoe the opinion of all the previous reviewers. He plays all instruments with equal perfectionm displayed on each track. Thanks Mr G for a lifetime of listening pleasure!"
5,Great album,This is a great album. I recently discovered this gem by accident while searching for something else. It sounded like it was worth checking out. Boy was I surprised. This is rory gallagher's band before he went solo and it is a great classic/blues rock album. THe guitar playing is awswome and there are plenty of moods to get into from blues to rock to jazzy stuff to rockabilly- ish. It's all great.
3,a good sequel,"Being a new fan of Mr. Niles work, I picked this up and quickly read it. I admit that the story has weak plot elements to it, namely the end (which I wont spoil). I felt a bit betrayed by the conclusion but understand its horror and shock value. Overall well done and the artwork continues to be top notch, one of the best. The setting moves from a forlorn Barrrow, Alaska to sunny Los Angeles (which makes for a great contrast). I wish the some of the minor characters had more development, but understand the limitations of this genre. I highly recommend it."
2,Not What I Expected,"This item is marketed as a ""book"" on this site, and although technically it is a ""book"", it's actually what is called an ""illustrated book"", or a ""graphic novel"" - or in other words, it's actually just a longer comic book that has been bound as a regular paperback book. It's a story that is told mainly with ""illustrations"", where the only reading is the balloons over the characters. I would call it neither a ""book"" or a ""novel"". If you're looking for something to actually ""read"", this ain't what you're looking for!"
3,Interesting authorship,"The book contains interesting strategies for winning at Monopoly, but even more interesting is the background of the authors. One, Jay Walker, later was the founder of Priceline.com, while the other, Jeff Lehman, eventually became president of Cornell University."
5,comfort!,"These Mary Jane Crocs are very comfortable, and I can even get away with wearing them with dress slacks!"
2,zester,"Does not produce results as expected. I have had better, not sharp Would have expected more from Martha Stewart. Sorry"
1,COMFORTABLE IF THEY ONLY FIT!!!,I BOUGHT A PAIR OF THE MARY JANE STYLE HOPING THE STRAP WOULD HOLD THEM ON MY FEET.THEY STAY ON BUT THEY LOOK RIDICULOUS. I HAVE AN A2 FOOT AND THESE CROCS COULD CARE LESS ABOUT THE PERSON WITH LESS THAN A MEDIUM OR WIDE SIZE FOOT. TOO BAD FOR ME AS I WOULD BUY SEVERAL COLORS. OH WELL - I TRIED.
5,very good product . . .,"Who doesn't like Crocs? I especially like these Mary Jane Crocs because they have the strap in the back. I don't use backless shoes, I don't like them flopping around. The one thing I would stress is that you follow their advice on the fit. Your toes should not feel the toebox, I should have bought the next size up but I was just sure they would be too big - wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, but oh well. They're a great shoe and I definitely want some colorful ones although I started with a generic color so that I could put anything with them. You'll love them - buy them now!"
3,Order them in a bigger size,"I really liked these shoes but had to return them because when I stood my foot slid foward and they were to small. I would recommend buying them one size up. When I bought my first pair of crocs thats what the sales guy told me, but then everybody made fun of my shoes being to big so thats why I got my size this time and look! they didn't fit! Just something to think about. Anyone who likes crocs will like these."
2,a tad disappointed,material looked faded (definitely not as deep of a black as picture and felt stretched out. Also right shoe straps keep coming unclipped which is very annoying.
5,Cros are great!,The Mary Jane Crocs are great for the professional.They are sleeker than the other crocs and very comfortable.This item was shipped quickly and without problem.Recommended.
5,Love me some Crocs.,"Seafoam, this time. Have a pair of army green mary jane style, too. Great for wearing in the garden, and walking right into the shower afterwards. Rinse 'em off and let them dry (seems to happen pretty quickly if you hang them up) and all's well."
5,super comfortable,"I made this purchase because we were no longer allowed to wear flip flops to work. These crocs are a great alternative! Very comfortable, light, and airy! I wear them about 6 out of 7 days!"
4,Shose Crocs,"I they unsign that the service of sending(parcel) in very good and efficient, there has come to me exactly what pedi and was delivered in the ruled date. Thank you!"
4,Can't Help Loving These,"They totally go against all my style impulses (ok, they're on the edge of ugly) but they're so comfy and the colors are fab. So thumbs up from me."
4,Overall they're nice shoes,"These crocs are really nice! The original ones are too bulky and big, but these are very slim and slender. They look great with flare or boot cut jeans and are very comfortable. They are light weight and pretty easy to clean if they get dirty. Mine lasted about 2 years then the bottom of the front of the shoe began to get really thin and all the grips on the bottom wore off. The strap broke off completely but I was able to fix it. Then the plastic button that hooks the straps to the shoe snapped in half, and I decided it was time to retire the shoes. Thankfully crocs has a recycling program you can send them to.My overall experience with this shoes has been a good one, I may even buy another pair."
4,Crocs,"These are comfortable and cute and I'm using them mostly as ""house"" shoes. I just feel like I should have ordered a half size larger. They just touch my toes and I think they would have been perfect if I had exchanged them."
4,A unique book,"Hitler's Squadron not only looks at the executive aircraft used by Hitler himself but also many key members of the Third Reich's leadership. The book has quite a bit of technical information on many of the aircraft used by this special organization (such as the Fw200) and discusses Hans Baur, a WWI ace who became a devoted Nazi and Hitler's personal pilot. The book is very well illustrated and has some great photographs but it doesn't discuss the actual organization of this specialized unit at any length. Nor the book have any maps showing bases that the squadron operated from, although it did include a layout of the Bunker (!) which Baur lived in for a while but was otherwise irrelevent.An excellent book within a very narrow spectrum of interest."
4,"""Good Thriller!""","Kurt Russell, J.T. Walsh and Kathleen Quinlan star in this 1997 thriller.After their car stalls, a man desperately searches for his missing wifehe believes is kidnapped. I think it's one of Kurt's best and J.T. wasa great villain. This dvd has good picture and sound, but only thetrailer. I recommend this good thriller."
5,One of Kurt Russell's best,"Breakdown has got to be one of the best suspense thrillers I've ever seen. The directing was great, the cast was great, and the ending car chase was top notch action. Moral of the story----don't get stranded in middle-of-nowhere Arizona !"
5,"Great film, Great cast","This is one of my favorite flicks. Kurt Russell is one of a kind. One of the few child actors who kept his career going after he grew past the the cute child star, teen idol, and mature star mold. Non stop suspense. Action for everyone. And wonderful support from The supporting cast. Most especially, the late, great J.T Walsh. The DVD is first rate. Excellent transfer, and imaging. The film echos of Hitchcock. And the location scenes are breathtaking. Highly reccomended."
5,Pure and Simple,"Breakdown is a thriller, pure and simple. Breakdown is about Kurt Russell's attempts to find his kidnapped wife.Breakdown is incredibly tense and suspenseful. The hero is no superman and does not wrestle down helicopters in his spare time. He becomes more and more terrified as his situation gets worse and worse.There are so other many films that call themselves thrillers but fall short. ""Breakdown"" is so simple and so effective that you'll feel like you've really been through something when it's over.Great stuff."
3,Want to give it 5 except for a couple of beefs...,"Beef 1: the dvd menu is anamorphically presented, but the MOVIE IS NOT!!!!!!!!! WHAT is Paramount thinking??? Couldn't the moron in the telecine bay have flipped the switch????? Unbelievable!Beef 2: a movie this great deserves some added materials, but there's none to be found. No commentary, nothing.This is a GREAT suspense film, with great performances throughout. And awesome desert cinematography!STILL, I CANNOT contain my OUTRAGE ANY LONGER - Paramount, get off your f______ a__ and issue a SPECIAL EDITION OF THIS!!!"
5,UNDERRATED,"This movie was one of the most suspenseful thrillers I have seen, yet it failed to win the praise of many movie goers. I hope Breakdown gets much publicity in the near future, because it still stumps me why I haven't heard of it before its HBO premiere."
5,where's my wife,"theres no doubt that Russell is a great actor. I mean this one fits him well. just think if him and Goldie Hawn,his wife, did this and Goldie Hawn was kidnapped. He'd flip out and frickin do something and he really shows the emotions and paranioa of his role and the suspense never lets go. hang on!!"
5,what a winner!!,"I was totally unfamiliar with this film til I caught it on tv last night...it's marvelous, a real edge-of-your-chair, no holdsbarred barrel-house of a ride with real villains who'll have youhollering at the screen. Watch it and tell your friends...it's a keeper!"
5,ROAD RAGE,"THIS IS ONE HECK OF A MOVIE. Kurt Russell, J.T. Walsh and director Jonathan Mostow combine to bring about a suspense-filled, action-packed thriller. Russell commands the movie, showing all the frustration, rage, and terror he feels in his pursuit of the rednecks who have absconded his wife. Walsh is an unparallelled villain, able to pull off his dastardly deeds and then go home to his wife and son. The scene in which both he and his wife tell their little boy to kill Russell is downright horrifying. Kathleen Quinlan, a good actress, doesn't have much screen time, but does well with what little she has. Mostow crafts some supremely bone-chilling chase scenes and the ending is breathtaking. I too wanted to cheer when the credits rolled.A brilliant, underappreciated film."
2,The Accidental Agent - No Surprises,"After reading the description of this book, I was looking forward to a page turner that would relieve me of a week of rain. Instead I found a book that was mildly interesting with characters that I neither loved nor hated. The plot did not rival the work of John Grisham or even Patricia Cornwall. I did find the setting interesting since I am familar with the area of North Florida coast. Yet, the book lacked the lyrical language of the Prince of Tides and true odd-ball southern characters.Disappoint was my biggest feeling about this book, for it did not live up to the description on the first few pages."
4,"Cooks fine, clean up is a little difficult","While putting it together we noticed two little end pieces were missing, but that was of little consequence. Also noted...the hole that is for drainage to a little outside cup is up too high to be of any use. We put a sheet of aluminum foil to line the bottom to catch any drippings.The tray is also hard to remove as directed. If the grid was set a little forward it would come out easier.The unit heats up quickly and does a great job with steaks, fish. Did cook hamburger that wasn't as lean as label said, and with the heat on high there was a fire. That can happen on any electric grill. I have another electric grill at different home and I like this one better. An improvement would be an outside indicator of what the temperature is inside the closed grill.I basically like this grill a lot. It's not expensive and does a nice job."
5,bette davis collection,"Arrived promptly and was a great hit with my 84 year old mother in law as a birthday present. ""Don't let's ask for the moon, when we have the stars!"" (Now Voyager), aaaaahahaha...."
3,Weird.,"I did not receive all five Bette Davis movies. Missing was ""The Letter""which was replaced with ""Dial M for Murder""- a great movie but not what I asked for. When I emailed Dena Sabin(2X) she never emailed me back."
5,Classy Lady of the Big Screen,"There is no finer lady of the big screen than Bette Davis. If you like tear jerkers, this is a must. If you want acting at its greatest, this is a must. If you just like watching the classiest lady in the world, this is a double must. Each dvd has a review from her peers, giving you inside information that only enhances the Bette Davis experience. A must have at any price."
2,Defective DVDS create inconvenience and frustration,"I've officially decided to stop ordering boxed sets from Amazon, as it more often than not results in the frustration and inconvenience of having to return/replace defective DVDs. In this case, 2 of the 5 DVDs were defective (Mr Skeffington & Now Voyager). I reviewed the other three films individually (all excellent and worth owning), but I cannot recommend boxed collections of this sort, purchased here."
2,what did you thinking???,"Bueno cuando vi,.,que iba a poner una coleccion de las peliculas de bette davis... me emocione..mucho..ya que valoro mucho su trabajo...pero..por que incluir... peliculas que ya existen en dvd....a excepcion de Mr Skeefington y The Star....esta ultima..si bien..es de mi agrado..creo que hay muchas otras opciones para .realizar la transferncia a Dvd....asi tenemos.:All this and heaven too, Marked Woman, In this our life, o hasta Hush hush sweet charlotte....creo que la coleccion de Joan Crawford esta mucho mejor escogia en cuanto a las peliculas.. ya que de las 5, 3 son titulos nuevos en dvd,,,favor tomar esto como una sugerencia,, para una segunda entrega,,,saludos cordiales"
4,ENJOYABLE,THESE MOVIES TAKE YOU BACK IN TIME WHEN LIFE WAS VERY DIFFERENT. IN SOME CASES MORE ELEGANT OR DRAMATIC BUT WHATEVER THE SITUATION BETTE DAVIS WAS GREAT. MEN WERE SO MUCH MORE THAN THEY ARE NOW. EACH MOVIE TOOK YOU TO A DIFFERENT PLACE AND MADE YOU MAD OR HAPPY OR SAD OR NOSTALGIC. TRULY ENJOYABLE.
5,I'm so excited!,"Both Bette & Joan collections on the SAME DAY!I know some people are upset that this set includes 3 prior releases, but fortunately for me, I don't own any of these titles yet.I agree with many others that Beyond The Forest & Hush, Hush definitely deserve that DVD treatment. Along with The Nanny, The Anniversary and The Petrified Forest.I also wish TCM would do a retrospect on Davis like they did for Crawford.I look forward to adding these 5 great titles to my own collection of All About Eve, Dead Ringer and The Burning."
5,Bette Davis Collection Vol. 1,"The first of three Bette Davis Box sets, including her most well known films at Warner Brothers Studios and one not often seen later film, ""The Star"". As expected, excellent performances by Ms. Davis in all the films in this collection."
5,lovely cards,"very pretty, I sold them in my shop to someone who was very happy to be able to buy them"
3,Nothing about JNDI ?,"Java has a directory API called JNDI. This book no more than acknowledge its existence. This book discusses LDAP and Netscape's Directory SDK. The author's mention that the book only covers Directory SDK. They don't provide any information on the differences between JNDI and Directory SDK, how the two can be used together or why they focused exclusively on the Directory SDK. What an oversight! The title is misleading. It should be: 'LDAP and Netscape's Java Directory API'."
3,Where's the JNDI?,"Well written book, but based on the author's proprietary API and not JNDI which is the modern approach, thus it's rather dated, hence the discount to 3 stars. The URL and other data still applies, but for actual Java code examples I liked Wilcox ""Implementing LDAP"" even though it isn't Java-centric. I look forward to the O'Reilly LDAP book to see what it's like."
1,With Java this stuff shouldn't be proprietary at all!,"Too bad that such talented authors have decided to write this book based on Netscape SDK and not on JNDI like they should have. The book really gives a wrong impression on how to code with Java & LDAP and causes major vendor-lock. Maybe all this was was the plan in the first place when this book was written, since both of the authors are from Netscape, Weltman being a designer of the Netscape LDAP SDK and Dahlbura a lead engineer specializing in LDAP implementation and planning."
1,This book is very poorly titled,"Focusing solely on Netscape's Directory SDK with the Netscape Directory Server, a more appropriate title would have been Netscape Directory Server via the Netscape Java Directory SDK.If you are not working with these specific tools, this book will be useless to you."
4,Great handbook for writing,This manual is great for any piece of writing. It is very helpful even when editing or proofreading. You won't regret having bought this book.
5,Prett Much The Best of The 80's Hard Rockers,"Say what you will about Bon Jovi, hard-rock wannabees, pop-metal, girly band, whatever....this album is just flat-out rock mastery.Funny thing about this disc, there were 5 top 10 singles, and not one of those is actually the best song on the album. A song buried on side 2 called ""Wild Is The Wind"" is not only the highlight of this disc, but quite possibly of any Bon Jovi album.""Slippery When Wet"" will always be their trademark, but ""New Jersey"" was their true masterpiece. One of the very few albums that even people that say they don't like Bon Jovi will tap their feet to every tune on it.""New Jersey"" is truly a testament to why Bon Jovi has been around for 20 years."
2,Sad...,"This band is as shallow as the shallowest thing ever devised. Bn Jovi (and Sambora and others that contributes songs here) know how to write cheesy, romantic anthems that pleases only teenage girls. The band has no substance, no sincerity. NEW JERSEY is one of their worst albums."
4,Solid album,"Good album, still showing growth from their Slippery When Wet days and has a good collection of songs that went to be some of their greatest hits."
5,Rocking socking Bon Jovi!!,"This album may be 16 years old now but its the only way to find ""Born to be my Baby"" which is an underrated Bon Jovi song. The other tracks are great especially the guitar riffs on ""Lay your hands on me"", Richie Sambora can flat out play!"
1,Please DON'T Do ANY More Beatles!,"Never a fan of Anne Murray, one can objectively understand why many people are drawn to her soft, soothing voice. She clearly is very talented, but that talent does not extend to Beatle songs.Her version of the 1964 classic, ""I'm Happy Just to Dance With You"" was horrendous. That is an excellent song and Murray's gross mistreatment of this Beatle classic was upsetting."
4,Outdated,I didn't realize that this book was published in1994. It is very outdated given the shifts in the political landscape since then. I know some of the authors philosophies are timeless and still relevant but i wish he had updated the book.
5,Frightening,"This book will terrify you, shock you, make you nauseous and give you nightmares. If it doesn't, you're either a government employee or brain dead. But I repeat myself...This book WILL change your life."
4,on the mark!,"James Bovard, argues in this book,that government is intruding in our lives,infringing on our rights as citizens.The tenets of modern political thinking is guided by its right to control and punish our behavior.This control is disguised by arguements of ""fairness"" as they continue their assault. This book is loaded with many assertions most of which is well supported,which will lead you to realize that we are forfeiting our freedom to be left alone,take risks, and ""pay for our own bloody noses"". Anyone suspicious of politicians today,will be frightened after reading this book.If you are like me,you will become more involved in being informed of governments attempt to increase its control,and resist in the few ways we have,such as standing up and voicing your opposition as loud as you can!"
5,Eye-opener,Numerous specific examples of the way government fails US citizens every day. If you are looking for reference material to convert a liberal this is a good book to start with.
3,Well Researched and VERY VERY DETAILED!!!!,"Get ready for tons of stats and info., this book is good, but long and broadly blames government for every bad apple. Political junkies: this is for you."
3,NOTHING WITHOUT MICHELLE VISAGE.,THIS SEDUCTION COMEBACK IS O.K. MICHELLE VISAGE MADE SEDUCTION! SEDUCTION PUT OUT ONE ALBUM. BACK IN 1989. MICHELLE VISAGE WAS THE BLONDE LEAD. AWESOME SINGER/RAPPER. ENIGMATIC. GREAT STYLE. SO APRIL HARRIS. DECIDES TO RE-CREATE SEDUCTION 15 YEARS LATER? GET A LIFE! SO SHE PUTS TOGETHER. A WHITE CHICK. HERSELF.(A BLACK CHICK.)AND A HISPANIC CHICK. (THE SAME ETHNIC PEEPS AS THE ORIGINALS.)GET RIGHT! GET A LIFE!! WORD OF ADVICE APRIL; DROP THE NAME SEDUCTION AND JUST PUT OUT THE MUSIC!!!
3,A slice of 1960's college life,"Most of this book is dedicated to an interesting (and I suspect somewhat autobiographical) sketch of the life of a college Freshman at the University of Maryland at College Park during the late 1960's. I especially enjoyed the story of the main character's romance with his first girlfriend. The book takes a somewhat unfortunate detour, however, with the introduction of a plot involving the solving of a crime that does not seem at all believable."
5,Add this book to your Florida must read list,"This book covers every natural area found within Florida. Within each area it will pick several species and detail how they interact with each other. For example, it goes into the relationship between the fox squirrel, longleaf pine and underground fungi in the high pine grasslands.The authors present the best explanation that I have read why fire is necessary for the survival of ecosystems and species.Any Florida resident who reads this book will have a greater appreciation for the natural wonders of their state."
5,Very good.,This will work perfect in developing future classes and will make an excellent supplement or primary class text. Worth the money.
2,not about local animals,not at all what i wanted i thought the book was more about the wildlife and pictures of them not about that at all.
4,A Priceless Overview,A great book for those looking for an introduction to the many plant communities and eco-systems of Florida. The wonderful photographs enhance the images drawn by the authors in the text.
1,Tin Elephant on a Bike,Not worth the money at all. Doesn't work properly - too much money for something that doesn't work well at all.
2,Bummed out,I was under the impression the ball on the top of the elephant would turn. It does not. I think it would be a much cooler toy if that part moved. No directions come with the toy. NO way of knowing if the ball was supposed to move or not. Bummed out. It is just a paper weight now.
3,An introduction to the Iron Duke,"Elizabeth Longford's ""Wellington"" is a very short introductory life of the First Duke of Wellington. It is derivative of her full-length biographies of Wellington and Queen Victoria but manages to be solidly informative without being overwhelming. Longford, in highly readable prose, provides a fast moving survey of the military and political life of Arthur Wellesley, weaving in the kinds of personal details that hang a more human face on a man and a time much mythologized. This work is clearly intended for the general reader; serious students of the Duke should track down Longford's two volume biography (""Years of the Sword"" and ""Pillar of the State""). Those looking for a detailed military biography should also seek elsewhere; this volume only lightly skims the surface of Wellington's long military career. This is the kind of book a serious student of Wellington provides as an introduction to the subject to his less serious friends and relatives."
1,didnt fit,"i baught this item for a nissan versa 08 it said ti fits but when i recieved it, it doesnt even enter the nossle of the gas cap. i feel ripped of."
2,Look for the unespected,"Nora Jones's first CD presented easy listening jazz that was enjoyable for the eclectic music lover wanted to add some mild jazz in their life. This new CD is deceptive in her first release Sunrise you can her the bluegrass influences in the still somewhat jazzy recording. After purchasing the album you discover that with the exception of a few tracts ,""Don't Miss You At All"" and ""Those Sweet Words"", it is a bluegrass album what I found enjoyable but not at all what I wanted when I purchased the album."
4,Unimposing and mellow,"I have always been confused by the categorization of Norah as a Jazz artist, and I must say this CD has done nothing to clear the confusion. I love the voice; it's perfect for jazz. Her piano playing is clearly jazz-influenced, and her band is certainly competent and capable. The music is simply not jazz. Having said that, I do like the music. Norah Jones music is simply Norah Jones music- unimposing and mellow. It's clearly all about the music instead being about the artist or the production. Overall, this record is a bit more upbeat than Come Away With Me, but listening to one after the other does not leave you wondering what happened. The overall style is the same; they complement each other well. If you're a Norah Jones fan, you will probably like the record; if not, this will probably not win you over, and quite honestly, it's probably not the best place to start. Get Come Away With Me first, listen for a while, and then try Feels Like Home."
3,"I thought it would be . . . well, not what I thought","I loved Norah's first album. Her take on more traditional standards was refreshing. The jazzy, bluesy, even country (not a big country fan) feel of her album was also something that I liked. I was really anticipating the new album and rushed out to buy it when it was released only to listen and keep hoping that something would blast through the speakers and pull me into the web of her music like the first album did but unfortunately that did not happen. Although, there are a couple of songs that stand out, it is a cd that is pleasnat to listen to. Not much more but certainly not anything less."
4,More than a one-trick pony,"Norah Jones absolutely surprised me with this album. I don't own, but have heard her first album and thought it was decent. It was a good jazz record. This one blew me away. Here we have a contemporary young artist doing good music! It's more country flavoured than her first and with the wailings of Dolly Parton it is an awesome listen! It's a quiet sunny Sunday afternoon listen. The highlights are ""Sunrise"", ""Creep On In"" and Tom Waits' ""Long Way Home""."
4,Listen to the entire CD for 2 hours,"Ok. At first I thought that Norah Jones' sophomore album is subpar to her debut. However, after listening to the entire album again, and again.... and well, again, it started to sound really good. From the heavenly ""Sunrise"" to the really at-home melody of ""The Prettiest Thing"", this album is pretty much diverse. Also, the lyrics are very poetic. Unlike other artists who have CD's with pretty much only one good song and the rest, well, crappy, I gotta say, kudos to Ms. Jones. She is the true embodiment of talent... a true artist with more substance than manufactured style. Her sound is a music pot - her songs just make you feel that good."
2,Disappointing...,"I hate to give a bad review as I think Norah Jones has a wonderful voice, but I found this CD just didn't do it justice. There wasn't nearly enough piano (which is of course the sound we all know her for) it was all guitars, twangy country sounding at times. The first song is good (which is why I gave it two stars instead of one) but I think the rest of it was weak in both sound and lyrics. I'm sure the band is really great, and I know Norah Jones is really great but I just think the two of them together didn't sound that great. I don't think she shouldve changed her sound quite so drastically for this album, maybe kinda ease us into it lol anyhow, thats enough of that, im positive that there will be a lot of people out there who do enjoy this album. If you like jazz and you like the country sounds then maybe this is for you???"
3,What happened here?,"Nora Jones, in here debut album just about knocked my sox off. Her rendidtions of old standards and a lot of the new material in the first effort were innovative and pleasing. The ""generically country"" Lone Star is a musically sweet and lyrically poetic number that no one else around today has paralelled. In the Feels Like Home album she has departed from all of the characteristics that made the first album so interesting and exhillarating. It would have been better for Nora's following if she had done at least a couple of albums based on the standards she set with the first production before exerting her independence in new areas, which seems to be what she has done with Feels Like Home. Diana Krall has become her own principal song writer in her latest Girl In The Other Room, but at least she gave us a half dozen albums of what brought her to our attention in the first place."
5,great sophomore album,a great pop jazz album from thegranddaughter of ravi shankar.highly recommended.
3,The debut album is much better!,"Although there are only three songs (Don't Know Why, Come Away With Me, Turn Me On) that I like from Norah's debut album ""Come away with me"", I've decided to give her 2nd album a try.I have been listening to both CDs and I can't help but to think that Norah's debut album is much better than her latest album. I was disappointed with the ""Feels like home"" album since it has more country like songs. Some of my friends also pointed out that all her songs sounded the same."
5,I LOVE THIS ALBUM!!!,"""Come away with Me"" was a great cd! I loved it so much. I wondered how Norah would come up with a follow up that was as good as the first. But I didn't need to worry b-cuz this album was great! Her voice is so relaxing, so after a hard day you can grab a cup of hot tea and read a good book while listening to her CD. You need to buy it! You'll regret it if you don't!"
4,The best way to relax- Norah Jones!,I think this CD is really good. I love listening to it while I am studying or stressed out because it just clears my head and relaxes me. Norah Jones has an amazing style that allows you to just sit back and enjoy her singing without too much going on in the background. I love it.
4,Feels Like Home,"Let's face it: Norah Jones is going to be great doing whatever she chooses. Her Grammy winning debut, Come Away With Me, is nothing short of spectacular. In my opinion, Feels Like Home is just as great, it's just different. While Come Away With Me is known for its jazz undertones, Feels Like Home possesses a light country twang that is charming and relaxing all at once. Like her first CD, Norah's vioce is front and center, and the subtle tinkling of her piano and the quiet strums of a guitar just add to the appeal of her airy, sweet, all together cozy voice. If people are giving Feels Like Home such low reviews because they're comparing it to Come Away With Me, then they are comparing apples and oranges. While they are both different, they are both excellent and satisfying CDs. Give it a try. The feel is inviting and warm, and does nothing but please and relax the listener."
4,Good Second Album,"I find this album to be a nice follow-up to ""Come Away With Me."" Norah Jones blends country and jazz effortlessly, and this is a find for anyone who enjoys both. My favorite track is the last one, ""Don't Miss You At All."""
4,Caught in the Middle,"I love Norah's voice which I think has great depth despite her youth. I thought ""Come Away With Me"" was fantastic due to the mix of great voice, great songs and the sulty sexy jazz undertones. On ""Feels Like Home"" her voice is still excellent, the songs are OK ish, but the whole feel of the thing is too ""Sugar and Spice"" if you know what I mean. I must confess to disliking Country Music in general and being put off by the whole ""Apple Pie"" type of thing, my urban upbringing I guess. All in all I still liked this album a lot, but because of the genre rather than the performance it fails to measure up to ""Come Away With Me""."
1,Why settle for less?,"I don't even own this CD. I've just heard it like 500 times because a lot of my less musically-inclined friends enjoy it. Other reivews of this CD are right, this is boring, uninteresting, and extremely unchallenging music. This ""music"" is so boring it would put coffee to sleep. It's just that regular morons dislike to be challenged when listening to music and prefer to never get any smarter. This crap is just plain watered down. Why listen to Norah Jones's version of Duke Ellington's Melancholia (intelligently renamed ""Don't Miss You at All"") when you can listen to the original, which is 10 times better and 10 times more musically advanced. It's like the difference between reading a picture book about Hamlet or the real play."
2,Weak second time showing,"I, like so many millions loved the first Norah Jones album.I anxiously awaited the follow-up, hopeing for a repeat of such a great package of songs. I was sadly disappointed. The first had no weak or throw away songs, the second seemed to be the left overs not good enough for that debut. I strained to find something that was likeable and easy on my ears. Memorable songs that made me feel good. This album seemed to be either rushed to cash in or simply uninspired.I continue to listen to the first and have filed away the second as a bad investment. Her mamagement could learn a few things from that of Tierney Allen, the silken voiced jazz and standard singer who has yet to come into her own with a major following.Ms. Allen's music always is up lifting and easy to listen to on ""repeat"" on my CD player. Not so with Ms. Jones second time out."
3,Just a rehash of already covered musical territory,"I loved the first album, but this one is just retread and there isn't anything that stands out in a positive way. Norah's voice is beautiful, the music is mellow, but, this is all pot boiler. Don't waste your money.I definitely agree with another poster who said the duet with Dolly Parton is very out of place. I like Dolly, and wouldn't mind something like that on a specialty album, but not here. The song sticks out as the proverbial bastard stepchild with it's country twang."
2,Rather disappointing...,"in comparsion to her first album, this definately pales.. Its boring and too country.. not just country-tinged.. Its horrible. If i wanted country i would have gone to the Country section.Even my boyfriend who loves 'Come Away with Me' agrees that 'Feels like Home' is a very lame follow-up."
2,Norah Jones. FEELS LIKE HOME,"I find the new CD to be the same old stuff. While some of thesongs are potentially 'exciting' I find that Norah's voice alone can not carry it off. I find the back up group rather lame! Her new CD back up music is so vastly inferior to her performance with The Peter Malick Group. In that CD Norah's voice combined with the groups superior performance produced a very special sound. If you are into POP like Celine Dion, Dianna Krall etc., I guess Norah's CD ok. I look for MUSIC first then voice !"
2,A snoozer ...,"I loved ""Come Away With Me"" the first moment I heard it. I also had the opportunity to see Norah and her wonderful band in concert ... the experience was absolutely FANTASTIC! I couldn't have asked for a better!So naturally I waited in eager anticipation for her new album ""Feels Like Home"" which after only one listen made me feel narcoleptic. It was a good thing I didn't try and listen to it while driving. To be perfectly honest, I haven't listened to it since.She is so talented, I wish this effort had been as successful as the first, but not everyone hits a homerun each time at bat.But I still hold out hope that her next album will be better."
2,Disappointing,"She doesn't have a great voice, the songs are boring and the lyrics very poor. I can't understand Norah's success. I bought the CD because the duet with Dolly Parton, the only acceptable track...just because Dolly'sa voice is still amazing. Is not jazz, is not pop, is not country, is not Good."
1,They Call this MUSIC!,If this is music what happened with the ART we call music. This must be a joke! I can't believe people a listen to this CRAP. ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ go to sleep and dream because after a good sleep you will feel better. I wasted my money. This is the only way I can revenge. Don't buy it because is a CRAP!
2,"Don't bother buying this one, buy the 1st CD instead.","If you absolutely love the 1st CD like I do, then don't buy this 2nd CD (Feels like home). It will disappoint you, really disappoint you. Just go to Apple iTune and download (buy) ""Sunrise"", ""Those sweet words"", and maybe ""carnival town"". The rest are quite disappointing compared to the what she had on the 1st CD. Boring songs and I don't even why she put Dolly Parton in the CD. I like Dolly, but just not in this context.So disappointed, I should demand my money back."
1,Feels Like Politics,"The recording industry once again gets behind some pretty face, with the right ""team,"" and poof...a star as born. Meanwhile, real talent like Peter Cincotti, Brian Evans, and Steve Tyrell are on the backburner. If you want the real thing, buy these three guys. Don't fall for the 12 Grammy hype that no one bought, just as no one should buy this CD."
2,Isn't it time you changed your diet?,"Norah Jones albums are like fast food burgers: engineered to be ""tasty"" to the masses so they'll sell in the gazillions. But that doesn't mean anyone gets nourished, or that connoisseurs should go anywhere near them."
1,Disappointment.,"I really do not have a great deal to say about this CD. It sounded to me more like a CD of the out takes that were not good enough for the first album. The sound is very similar to her first album, but the tracks here lack any life. This leads to a bland bland noise/sound.So do yourself a favour and save your money to spend on another album you want."
2,More of the same,"Pretty mediocre compared to the first album. Basically more of the same, but less clean and the lyrics are awful."
1,Good Marketing Job,"Good marketing, Good product positioning, Good product launch, ... BAD CD. It doesn't even deserve to be on the top 100, not to mentioned being the best selling album!!!I bought both her CD's just to find out what people were talking about, and after listening to it three times, I have retired it to my coaster section. She has a good voice, but every song on both CD's sounded too much alike, making it a touture to listen to both CD at the same time. Before you go out and buy this, borrow it from a friend who has it, and if you can listen to it more than twice and like it, than buy it, otherwise, save your money, or buy any of Diana Krall's CD instead."
4,Different mood,"I liked this CD, I'm not sure if I like it as well as her first one or if you just have to be in a different sort of mood when you listen to it. For those of you who can't get enough of Norah Jones, listen to her track on the Dolly Parton compilation (Just Because I'm a Woman). Norah sings ""The Grass is Blue"" and it is great."
4,Really sweet and pleasant,"She is great and sweet. I still like the first CD better than the second. However, this last CD has new rhytms and tones I like. I do recommend it. It is very relaxing and pleasant to listen."
3,not what i was expecting,"I am a big fan of Norah Jones and her musical efforts. However, this particular album was not what I was hoping for. Her vocals were just average. Though she did have some stellar guests assisting her on some of the tracks. Listening to the album made me long for the vocals that she produced on ""Come Away With Me"". This time around the album was not as musically ""tight"" as ""Come Away with Me"". The band just wasn't up to filling the shoes left by the previous album. The album was also too twangy and slow for my tastes. The first album had a much wider mix of slow and fast paced music. Please listen to the album in the store before you purchase it unless you are diehard Norah fan."
2,A let down follow up cd.,"I read in a magazine interview that Miss. Jones did not want to be seen as ""Just A Jazz Singer"" an on this cd she wanted to show her country music influence, which she got growing up in Dallas, Tx. On a side note she came out of the same perfoming and visual art school as fellow Dallas Texans, the great contempary jazz trumpter Roy Hargrove, and neo-soul singer Erykah Badu. Back to this cd, while I really like her voice, she is out of her league as some sort of neo-country female singer. Although the cd does have it's solid moments such as track 11 ""The Prettiest Things."" I give her credit for try to branch out into different sounds,but one must know what works and what does not. I hope that by her next new cd she knows the The quote of Miles Davis ""Great Music, like great art is more define by what's left out, rather than what's put in."""
5,Feels Like Home,"I am not going to write a lengthy review. I will say that I think this is my favorite Norah Jones CD. In this day and age I am very glad we have a few artist that I actually like and Norah is one of if not my favorite, She can sing, and makes great music. Recording is very well done which makes it sound oh so good on a great sound system.I design and make My own speakers so I guess you could say I am into that kind of thing. I have a friend who likes way harder music than I do and He actually likes Norah also. When describing Her voice I agree Billy Holiday is fairly close and a complement."
3,Too country for me,"A good album and shows her versatility, but a little too country for me. I prefer the jazz overtones and harmonies."
2,not so much,disappointing I must say - I was one who imagined all of her success came from one track on the last album anyway tho - I have much respect for Norah Jones - just not sure I would buy another CD....after I listened to the full stream here at amazon I decided NOT to buy this one. only came back to see what other reviewers had to say.
2,Highly disappointed,"Come away with me was a rare find and is one of my favorite CD's. It is very seldom you find a CD where you actually love all of the songs and don't do a lot of track searching.After much anticipation and excitement,Feels Like Home finally arrived and it definitely needs a vacation. This CD lost soul along the way; actually about half way through the first track. I searched and searched for a song I actually liked on this CD and disappointingly didn't find one. I also was very disappointed when I was surprised with Dolly Parton's contribution. If I wanted to hear Dolly Parton I would buy one of her CD's and yes there is a huge difference between blues and country. This CD probably will be a hit with the country music fans. Norah go back to what you do best !!!!!!!"
1,This CD SUCKS,This CD sucks hugely. Who can anyone buy crap like this? Are you people idiots? Norah Jones is a dull singer and needs to shut up.
3,Enh.,"I really, really liked ""Come Away With Me."" I like this album because it's more of the same. On the other hand, I am unimpressed with this second album because... it's more of the same. Moreover, somehow, this second time around, the sound and the lyrics seem trite in a way that they did not on the first album.And for gods' sake, who ever thought that people who like Norah Jones' voice and singing style would appreciate Dolly Parton's shrill caterwauling?!?"
5,Better Than the First,"I have had about a month to listen to this CD now, and I like it even more than when I first got it. ""Feels Like Home"" is a wonderful CD. Norah's voice sounds stronger than ever, and there is more variety of songs on this album compared to her first album. Some songs, especially the beautiful ""Those Sweet Words,"" ""Sunrise,"" ""Carnival Town,"" ""The Prettiest Thing,"" and ""Don't Miss You At All"" and ""Toes"" would fit in perfectly on the first album, while others like ""Creepin' In"" and ""The Long Way Home"" lean a little bit more towards country and a new direction for Jones.The album as a whole is not a radical departure from her first, but there are enough changes for it to avoid the sophomore slump. You can't go wrong buying this album."
5,Great CD you can listen to again and again,"I like all kinds of music - jazz and country included. And unlike some reviewers, so far my favorite song is ""Creepin' In"" with Dolly Parton. My kids love it too!"
3,Feels Like... I'd Rather Come Away With Me,"This is a good sophomore effort by Norah Jones in an attempt to try something different to her follow-up multi-platinum Grammy-winning smash, Come Away With Me. When I first received Come Away With Me, I played it in my CD for hours and days, potentially killing the CD. Not so when I received Feels Like Home. Norah Jones' sultry voice still comes alive on songs like ""Sunrise,"" ""Humble Me,"" and ""The Prettiest Thing,"" which placates the cravings of listeners who want to hear something similar to Come Away With Me. Songs such as ""Toes"" and ""Creepin' In"" (duet with Dolly Parton) can drive the listener nuts (namely if you don't like country music). I was able to wholeheartedly recommend Come Away With Me, but I don't feel the same way with Feels Like Home. It was a good effort by Norah Jones to try something new, but the elements just don't add up. Miss Jones can do better."
2,A far cry from her first album,"If you like country music, Dolly Parton or Tammy Wynette you will probably like this album. If you were expecting more of Jones' jazzy songs from her debut album, you'll be dissapointed."
1,Hype,Anticipated this album and was promptly deflated and disappointed. Songs lack luster and range. Lyrics are absolutely horrid. Save your money...what a waste of talent.
3,Could do better,"My initial reaction to this cd was that it was a terrible example of someone hanging on to the coattails of their first highly acclaimed album, but I have to admit it has grown on me somewhat with more listening.It definitely doesn't have the style of ""Come Away With Me"" and the country stuff definitely has to go - some of the baselines remind me of cartoon music! I don't know what she thought she was doing duetting with Dolly Parton - it shows a total disregard for her fanbase. ""Creepin' In"" and ""Long Way Home"" are so annoying I just have to press the skip button. But having said all that, the rest is relatively enjoyable - it won't light up your life but it's decent enough background noise."
2,Extremely disappointing,"After the lovely ""Sunrise,"" the album descends into a morass of slow, doddering songs without any hint of charm."
3,Not My Cup of Tea,"Still trying very hard to warm up to Norah Jones. She is undoubtedly extremely talented--both her pipes and her piano playing. However, the tunes are simply boring. Many of them are painfully similar. More power to her if she can continue selling millions of cds with this formula."
4,Soothing and sweet,"If you liked her first CD, you'll enjoy this one too. It's somehow a little edgier - especially her duet with Dolly Parton - but Jones' voice is just as sultry and smooth as before. Highly recommended."
5,Realllllly NICE!,"What a beautiful voice! I could listen to her for hours and hours! The music is palatable and soothing, kind of a folksy jazz. If you like Anita Baker, Carole King, and Anne Wilson, you'll like Norah-just wonderful. I'll copy this review on her two other most recent works, as it applies there as well. She has established and proven herself, with a wide-enough body of work, so that she deserves all the recognition, for a wonderful talent, that she gets, and then some!"
5,She is one the best blues singers out there,"In the modern world of hustle and bustle people don't take time for music like this and for me it's been a revelation. I'm just getting into Blues. I have listened to Jazz for many many.... many years but haven't really taken time with the Blues. She has taken some Mississippi mud and formed something I didn't expect to find. This music is timeless because she brings you back to the where Blues came from but in a clean modern setting. She is essential music in my opinion and highly undervalued as a musician. I own both of her musical ventures to date and both of these are very powerful in their simplicity, straight forwardness and honesty. The sheer majesty that people miss in her music is that she isn't pretentious about who she is but she knows her value. This is good stuff."
4,Soothing and satisfying,"While I loved ""Come away with me,"" this one has lots of great songs, too, and I definitely would recommend it to anyone who loved her previous album. My favorites so far are ""Sunrise"" and ""Those Sweet Words."" I think some of the other reviewers expected too much or something drastically different, but this one is great and definitely a quality second album."
4,Diverse,This is a good CD with a very diverse musical style. It is obvious that the people that do not like it are pigeon-holed into one style of music and do not venture away from that. It is refreshing to see a musical artist that can go between styles of music with ease and do it well. It is so boring to hear a musical artist that sounds exactly the same on every one of their albums. I do not like every song on the CD but 80% of it I can listen to and I think she has a fantastic voice. There is one song where I think she sounds like Dolly Parton.
4,Great music...lose Bandlink,"I actually think many of the songs are better than the first CD. Those who truly don't like the style...never will. Those who love the style...her style...will continue to buy. Guess music does that to folks & always will.But...the reviews I find most interesting include the notes about Bandlink. I for one do make my own compilations, not to give away, but to listen to with other songs I prefer to listen to. Using software to mess up PCs will destroy the sales market, not enhance it. Perhaps the fools who think this will create sales know something the people who buy music do not know. If I had access to a list with CDs containing Bandlink...and I'm sure there is...I would not buy them."
3,Nice Demo- When does the REAL recording get released?,"The song writing and performances are great and is a nice follow up to her debut. The problem is with the recording. It sounds as though it were recorded on cheap cassette tapes and played back through the stereo in a 1979 Toyota. I honestly checked to see if my speakers had gone bad. Please remaster the sessions and re-release this disc without the ""sincere"" homemade accoustics. Ms. Jones voice is too sultry and beautiful for such intentional low quality audio and it is really distracting to the point of being unlistenable."
1,"Feels Like Something, But Not Home","This album is underwhelming. Jones's fine voice that was so great on her first album is overly ""helped"" by her backup singers. Yes, the venerable Dolly Parton was okay on ""Creepin' In"", but Norah needs little, if any, vocal assistance at any time or on any song. Also, there was not enough of her piano, except on Track 13, ""Don't Miss You At All"". But worst of all, her songwriting seems to have gone quite lukewarm. Her band is fine, but after all it's her name on the front cover. After the masterpiece of ""Come Away With Me"", this second album gives me the feeling that she left without us. Frankly, I want my money back."
2,A bit too country for my tastes...,"I loved Come Away with Me because of the jazz feel and Jones' voice. I still like the voice, but this album is waaaay more country..."
4,Surprisingly good.....,"I was a bit apprehensive with purchasing this one. I got COME AWAY WITH ME after hearing DON'T KNOW WHY and was a little disappointed. But I am glad I didn't listen to my mind...and went with what my sould was saying. This album is surprisingly good....and a little more upbeat than the previous. It is quite obvious that the country influence has definitely come into the Norah's music. The best songs on here are SUNRISE...and the absolutely awesome CREEPIN' IN. Norah and Dolly Parton sound really great together....and I really hope this is the next single, because I really think it has a chance to become a big hit. It is a jazzy mingling of bluegrass that is sure to get your heart beating and your toes tapping! The rest of the album complements these two tracks, and I think it is worth a listen whether you do it at a listening booth or actually buy the CD and take it home. You will be pleasantly surprised....and the songs just won't get out of your head!"
2,Watered down beer?,"Reminds me of watered down beer at a night bar - as opposed to the night bar itself. A bit disappointing, a bit too light, and a bit sour... and mostly overall, just not authentic. I rather listen to Diana Krall."
2,Sounds like the last CD,"I don't know what all the hype is about. I mean she goes in one direction and stays there. The melodies sound a little too much alike (tto tranquile, boring)..I don't get it..what's all the hype about, this CD belongs in the Country genre, it's good elevator music, but trust me it will never be in full rotation on my home or car stereo system....Noarh I like you, but could you please give us other melodies, let your hair down and jam a little, geeze"
1,Total waste of money,"I loved the first CD so much, that I couldn't wait for this one. It was an absolute disappointment. It will be difficult for her to recover from this fiasco."
2,Sleep inducing,"Much of what made Norah Jones's first CD interesting is missing from this follow-up CD. Perhaps too many of the songs were written by or with Lee Alexander; (Jesse Harris, who won a Grammy for his ""Don't Know Why"" on Jones's _Come Away With Me_ CD, doesn't appear)there's less of a jazz-aware sensibility and more of a country - not exactly sure sensibility in this one. Her next effort needs more musical exploration, more tension, and more feeling, or listeners are going to start believing that they've got all the Norah Jones they need."
2,A huge dissapointment!,I have her debut album and it was a great album to listen too and I enjoyed it for a while!But I just got this yesterday and I am very disapointed the songs are all plain and have a very boring sound to it!If your gonna get an album from her you might aswell get her debut one its more worth it!
1,Feels Like Forever!,"YAAAWWWWWWWWNNNNNNNNN!!!!......Oh is the CD over yet??I can't believe how boring this one is. I can't tell if it's the first or the second album. Here is one of the most overrated artists ever. It's not original, it's not entertaining and her voice isn't that good. So I ask, what's with all the hoopla??!!!!!Avoid ladies and gents."
2,Mediocre Emulation!!,"Undoubtedly,the talent stroking the black & white is distinguishable.However,it feels like a regurgitated act at best...thus,the obvious reek of inanimate imagination.Head straight to the likes of Rachael Yamagata for a more innovative fresher act..and DO Free Fiona!! www.freefiona.com"
1,Not impressed,I didnt enjoy the experience of listening to this album one little bit. Unless your a 50 year old woman going through a mid life crisis i wouldn't recomend this to you.
1,Gold HDCD is a FRADULENT CD! as per EMI Record Company,"I found one on a google search from a small company in Portugal. The sound is bad and at times scratchy as though they re recorded using a regular cd as a master. Anyway, the fellow at EMI Records in NY who handles Norah Jones emailed me back to let me know that they never made a HDCD for Norah Jones and that this one is Pirated and that they are now investigating the matter. Gold CD with extra tracks and 24 bits... too good to be true! Jody Koval"
3,"sorry, Norah...stick to cover songs!","I bought this CD really really wanting to love it, just as I loved NJ's debut album ""Come Away With Me"" which truly deserved to sell its 8M copies and also because Jones is a gorgeous woman both visually and vocally.Unfortunately it's been a hard slog. Unlike her first album, Jones wrote most of the songs here herself. They turn out to be simply mediocre tunes, despite Jones' beautiful voice and refreshingly spare style. Not terrible, but nothing special---lyrically nor melodically. Just very forgettable. The best ones are her covers of Tom Waits' ""The Long Way Home"" and Duke Ellington's ""Melancholia"" which she renames ""Don't Miss You At All.""Oh yeah, and the country-ish twang really needs to go. Sigh. Norah Norah, PLEASE COME *HOME*!!!"
2,Pretty Boring,"This CSW was nothing special. I enjoyed her first CD, but this one is a little more ""blah"". I was hoping she would use her sultry voice and continue with the bluesy type songs. This album leans more toward country, and is really not her style. I wouldn't recommend this album. Keep listening to ""Come Away With Me""!"
3,It's okay - but not great,"I've also recently purchased Norah's first album, and feel that while the arrangements and instrumentals are beautiful,both albums are just too precise, too measured, and therefore somewhat sterile. I saw Norah Jones in concert, and the same was true of her live set. It's almost like she's afraid to make a mistake, so she doesn't allow herself to be really brilliant. I think she has talent --- but perhaps she needs more time to grow into her ability.When I bought 'Feels like Home', I also bought the new one by Susan Werner (I Can't Be New), and in terms of this type of music, I really like it a lot better. Surprising, because Norah is a big name, and Susan really isn't. I'd say skip Norah, check out Susan Werner, and get more sultry vocals, jazzy arrangements and amazing writing for your amazon dollar.I'm a big fan of good songwriting, and unfortunately for Norah, I have to look elsewhere.Norah does have a great voice though."
2,Disappointment,"Her first CD was calming, sweet, jazzy, and nostalgic. I listed to ""Come Away with Me"" too much, but I still like it. So, I was excited to get her new CD. It's terrible; there's not a song I like on there. I still listen to her first CD; her second CD is lost somewhere."
4,Someone has GREAT taste!,"It's so wonderful to see someone with a great new spin on Townes Van Zandt's ""Be Here to Love Me"". What a terrific song!I'm new to her but Norah sounds great too.StoneyG."
2,Even the positive reviews are lukewarm,"Two stars because it isn't a bad album. It just isn't very good, either. The gushing male DJs on our local ""jazz"" station can't get enough of her, which means that the CD is heavily overplayed, and this is not a work that takes to being played very much...before it's played out, simply because there is so little depth to it. She makes the most of her meagre voice and uninspiring piano playing, but she isn't going anywhere with it on this particular effort.Good for people who want some unobtrusive music whittering away in the background, or by ""pack listeners"" who buy what the media tells them to, but no originality here."
4,Nora Jones is a Star!,This is the next big great American voice. Like a Whitney and so much hipper than Madonna.
2,"Nice Music, Poor Recording","This disc could be fine entertainment if one could listen through the awful distortion to appreciate the performance. Appears Ms. Jones and her success has gone the way of all good things to create a market for Norah Jones, not her (abundant) talent...a shame and a poor reflection on Blue Note, I'm sorry to say. It's very disappointing! Let's hope they wise up and remaster/reissue this CD at a quality we should expect."
3,No Grammys Here,"This highly-anticipated latest release by Norah Jones, after her sensational tour-de-force debut album two years ago, is regretfully disappointing.""Feels Like Home"" comes up short to its predecessor, ""Come Away With Me"", in both artistic originality and lyrical beauty. In short, Ms. Jones is unable to capture the same magnetic spark and energy she so beautifully demonstrated in her 1st album.Purchase ""Feels Like Home"" only if you're a big fan of Ms. Jones', otherwise please dutifully wait for her next work--hopefully one that is representative of her unparalleled talent."
1,Calling all people with insomnia,"When i heard she got 8 grammies, I got her first CD that very day and played it. I had hardly been through half of it before I fell asleep and slept like I've never slept before. Her lyrics are very boring. Her voice is the worst (it is melodious but it doesn't catch your attention. I'd rather listen to Britney) Why on earth did this female get 8 grammies? In my opinion she deserves half a grammy. Just the base of it probably.I borrowed my friend's 'Feels like home' just to see whether she's improved. I saw no difference at all and I hope she doesn't get a grammy this time.What's more, when I borrowed my friend's copy, she took my copy of 'In the zone' by Britney Spears. And now she wants to exchange them. HEAVEN FORBID!!!"
1,She Puts Me To Sleep,"While I gave her debut high marks, I soon after began to tire of this little girl very quickly. Restraint is one thing, but sheeeesh!!!, this CD renders me comatose. Her Live shows are pretty bland, but on record you can experiment and try something new. There is no excuse for music this lifeless and hackneyed. Put on ""Feels Like Drone..."" only if you run out of Sominex."
1,What Is Going On?,"The thing that amazes me more than anything is the amount of albums that this lady has sold. It just doesn't make any sense to me. Just who is it that she knows that makes critics hail her? This is the kind of music that nobody should ever be forced to deal with. Don't Know Why has been her only hit, yet somehow it was enough to sell 8 million records. This album is absolutely depressing. If this is supposedly the best artist in recent years, it's no wonder why music sales have declined so much. In 10 years people will have already forgotten who Norah Jones was. People talk about how the love her voice. If you got a 6 yeary old with a sour throat to sing, I guarantee it would sound identical to Norah's voice."
1,Rated for disk not artist.,I have no real idea if I like this album or not as I have returned it due to the fact that the disk has copy protection on it. Since I refuse to buy CDs that have this (as it is not part of the CD standard) I have not had a chance to listen to the complete CD.Beware if you are planning to buy this album that it has CD copy protection on it.P.S. Amazon should be including this warning on items that contain copy protection since I have had these types of disks cause problems with my equipment.
2,8 Track is Coming Back!,"I loved the first album so rest assured I'm not anti-NJ. I am extremely disappointed in this offering. The sound quality is awful, awful, awful. It stinks. Next time, rent a studio...Too country. Enough said.No snap. No zest. She's like 23? This album sounds like she's already bored with the whole singing career thing....In summary. If you live in a small town where the local bar sometimes has live music, this CD will remind you of that experience....you know, the CDs they hawk when they go on breaks? The ones neatly stacked on the piano? Well here you go except they ain't 5 bucks...."
4,"pleasing, but not quite as good as her last album","If you liked her first album, then I think you will enjoy this one as well. It has more of the jazzy, laid back songs that have become her trademark. Unfortunately, I think this album has become a victim of her own success. While Nora once sounded unique and refreshing, this album is a bit repetitive and lackluster. Although she is still much different, both vocally and stylistically, from most other singers, her last album, ""Come Away With Me"" has saturated the airwaves and dulled my senses to her style of music. Also, this album seems even more laid back than ""Come Away With Me"", if that is possible, and fails to showcase the range of her incredible voice. Overall I like the album and recommend it. Just don't have high expectations before you hear it and you won't be overly disappointed."
3,Feels like home,"Good - not great music collection. Jones' voice is sometimes compelling and sensual, sometimes just weak. I probably would not buy this CD again."
4,Yay Norah,"I really enjoyed Norah's first album, that one is must have. This one is nearly as good. It does have a country feel to it. The lyrics are beautiful, as usual for her. I give it 4 stars because while it's not as good as her first one, I still thoroughly enjoyed it. She is awesome!"
4,Sophomore flop I think not!,"Well I must say that I was a bit worried when my favorite artist of 2003 was coming out with a new album. But no need to worry I now have two CD's that I put in the player and just chill. This CD transports me to a totally different place.I really like the background vocals on Be Here To Love Me. Also I think there is a lot more music on this CD than the other. We really get to hear allot of The Handsome Band's talent.Go buy it now you won't be disappointed! Oh and dolly on Track 7 is just an awesome surprise, classic!"
5,She's Done It Again,"There's no sophomore slump for Norah. This CD is just as good, if not better, than her debut. Norah is going to go down as one of her generation's bestsongwriters, and listening to this CD will prove why. The songs are generally moe upbeat than her debut, but ifyou liked it, you'll have to have her second offering."
4,Marvelous,"I admit that when I first heard the album, I felt disappointed. But on the second listen, I began to hear it for what it is: Fine music, obviously different from the previous album, but fine music nevertheless. I'm enjoying it more and more."
4,"Languorous, evasive, full of hurt, lonely","Anyone who listens to this anticipated recording by Norah Jones and pays little attention to the pivotal song, ""Humble Me, Lord,"" will NOT understand the nature of this collection. Norah is quietly exposing an enormous world of hurt and loneliness and, more important, quiet humility before her muse. She's genuinely swept away with this mellowness and humility. Her voice is saying, ""This is just what you get, take it or leave it, and thanks anyway."" That's exactly why Dolly is a participant here (on ""Creepin' In""). And that is why one inspiration for these strange, mellow, languourous songs must be one phase of Bob Dylan (whether Norah knows it or not). There is surely no hard rain fallin' here. Hey, Norah's rain is exceedingly soft; it's satin and silk. This sound is our strange America in a distant, brave new millenium. This is a dubious and worrisome ""Sunrise"" that, alas, very much ""feels like home."" I really dread the next recording from Norah."
3,Mediocre at best,"Norah Jones has a distinct vocal quality unfortunately this album does little to showcase it. The only work I found truly compelling was the first track, ""Sunrise"". Her Duet with Parton, ""Creepin in"", was energetic and was different from the rest of the album. I took to ""Toes"" even though it was only slightly better than any of the other mediocre tracks. Overall this album didn't showcase her voice as well as ""Come Away with Me"". Except for the three tracks I mentioned above it's really great background dinner music. Otherwise it's unremarkable. Thankfully I got it cheap from Best Buy."
2,Feels like being stuck in the desert,"Poor Norah! They say that winning ""Best new artist"" is a curse. There have been a lot of artists who've won the award, and faded into obscurity, never repeating their success, and eventaully, disappearing off the face of the planet. It seems that the beautiful, sultry, classy Norah Jones is no exception. Her first album, ""Come Away With Me"" was a brilliant, stunning masterpiece showcasing a subtle, gentle beauty that was as warming as it was cool. However, her sophomore album is extremely disappointing, to say the least. the songs aren't melodic, but bland, boring, and overly produced. It is too bad that Jones' ""Feels Like Home"" is suffering the post-Grammy blahs. It seems that ""Come Away With Me"" was a blockbuster movie, and the sequel is underwhelming with a poor script, the same old plot, and nothing more to offer."
4,Very Good.,Norah does nice work again. What a pleasure it is to hear voices like hers. My appreciation for this style of music has grown. Now with artists like Norah and young Michael Bublé leading the way we're in for a pleasant musical journey.
2,Disappointing,I absolutely loved her first album and unfortunately this one can't even shake a stick at &quot;Come Away With Me&quot;. It's too ambiguous to be categorized and too poor a showing for a category to actively seek to claim it.Save your money... hopefully her next album will make up for the flop this one is.
4,Cyndi Lauper and Norah Jones..Feels like home,"I bought Norah's new CD and is awesome. Her songs are a piece of art. I play ""Feels Like Home"" followed by ""At Last"" from Cyndi Lauper and have chills. Add ""At Last"" by Cyndi Lauper to your collection and you will feel like home, at last."
2,Feels Like Home,A real disappointment from her previous album. I want more jazz.She should have stuck with what made her famous.
5,BEST CD*******,"This is the best cd in my collection...she has an outstanding voice, that is pleasant to the ears and heart.I own all of her's and am waiting for the next one..You've got to try this one. listen to all of it first."
3,Not what was expected,"I was very excited when I heard Ms. Jones was coming out with another cd. Yet ,I am a bit disappointed in this one. The songs all sound the same which sound the same as the first. It would have been nice to have a little more variety and for her to try a little differnt things.I still enjoy the cd, but it is not my favorite. I hope her next one will offer something different!"
2,More Sedation!,"Norah Jones latest release ""Feels Like Home"", proves to be a very sedate and uneventful cd. Just like her debut, Jones comes off sounding like a piano lounge singer at best. There is no risk taking in her music at all, as she maintains a constant recipe of boring muzak, that will not tax her vocal chords anytime soon. Roberta Flack was a similar soft piano chrooner, who was very successful, because she had superior voice and material. This latest release is riding high, thanks to the popularity gained by her first release, but there is nothing earth-shattering or groundbreaking here to warrant 5 star reviews. If you want groundbreaking, from a female piano vocalist, I suggest you revisit Carole Kings Tapestry! That is what I call a monumental album."
5,She does it once again,"I bought this album without even listening to any of her current singles, but I was definitely not dissapointed. Her music is instantly warm, welcoming, and easy to listen to. Whether she's singing about love lost, love found, or just life; her voice has that rare ability to make me feel like I am a part of it, and you never feel like it's too much or too little. Truly one of today's most promising music artists."
2,Just didn't feel like home to me,"I don't know, but Norah Jone's just doesn't do it for me on this album. Every single track is very slow and very relaxing. Don't get me wrong - I LOVE slow and relaxing music. That's more my style, so of course, I LOVE Norah Jones and her soft voice. But for some reason, the songs weren't up to par on this album. Her voice is just as great as Come Away With Me, but the songs are so slow and boring! I couldn't even listen to the entire cd. The only good songs are Sunshine and Creepin' In with Dolly Pardon. I suggest that if you want soft, easy listening - buy Mindy Smith, she does it much better than Norah this time."
1,cd has spywear that will mess up your computer,"The music is not bad, not too different from her previous album. The CD contains stuff to mess up your computer if you listen to it there. It is like a telemarketer that calls when you are having candlelight dinner with your date. I would not recommend buying it because of this problem. Norah should fire her managers."
1,WAY TO COUNTRY!!!!!!!!,"Not at all like the 1st CD! The whole CD has a country sound. Too much of her back up singer in this one. Might as well be listening to Dolly Pardon! If you want to listen to country buy it. If you're looking for another CD with the sound and style of Come Away with Me, then keep looking!"
1,Ugh!,"How could Norah, of all people, let us down like that? Me and my wife were enourmous fans of this blossoming young artist's debut album, and anxiously awaited the next one. But this is crap! It is pure country! That's okay, I guess, but this is taking it too far. We were hoping for another Come Away With Me.It makes me sick to think that artists like Norah don't give a hoot about their fans. They just do what they wanna do. Me and my wife feel like Metallica fans must have felt when the band turned alternative. Please, at all costs, stay away from this one. It is not worth anything."
1,what is wrong with the world?,"im not going to write a lot because, looking through the reviews, i see that many are negative. i just want to point out that this is not music. talking sexily and playing piano one key at a time does not make a song, an album, or a musical masterpiece. norah is probably the sexiest TALKER that i have ever heard but that does not mean she should get a record contract and brainwash people into thinking her ""music"" is calm and refreshing. its not music. even worse, its not music and its boring. i am astounded. i thought making albums was saved for the musically talented. i guess i was wrong"
4,"Different, but not ""bad""","She's an artist with great vocals. I listen to her for vocal talent, not necessarily the lyrics..yes, they need work but at least she can sing. too much of music today has not a shred of real talent to present, just pretty faces. You can hear many influences in there, and it was even apparent on her first album. This album is more raw, which is not entirely a bad thing. The ""country"" sound everyone is talking about is more of a blues based sound than country..One song is bluegrass, with Dolly Parton..The rest of the reviews on here are misleading. This is Folk/Blues with a traditional jazz song at the end. Good album, with room for more great music to come."
5,No Sophomore Slump for Norah!,"Given the tremendous success of Norah Jones' first album, it is inevitable that the critics are gunning for her this time around. Don't pay the critics any mind...this album is perfection! Norah remains true to her jazz and blues roots but manages to infuse a subtle hint of country. Not so different from Come Away With as to alienate fans of that album, but different enough to make it stand apart. Fantastic!"
3,Boring,"Contrary to her fantastic first album this is a boring follow-up. I only managed to listen to it once, it is so annoying. I very much await her upcoming third album so that I can forget this bloomer."
3,Good,"This album is good. I gave it three stars because there is only four songs that I love. Nora Jones is kind like Jazz/Blues (to me). I like this album, but not the firs one. That one I give it to my dad, its one star. I recomend it to buy this album, and I think this review was helpful. (that was just my opinion)."
2,Norah Bores,"This album is a musical exercise in dullness, no zest here, no vivacity what so ever. I don't understand all the buzz about this girl. She's good, but not in this setting. Disapointing, because here first album is much better.Warning: Do not listen to this album while driving a vehicle, may induce drowsiness."
5,Norah Jones goes a little country with a gorgeous new album!,"With her sophomore album, Norah Jones has decided not to stray too far form her proven formula, but the new album improves on a few of the pitfalls of ""Come Away With Me"": There are a few more up-tempo numbers (and more variety) on this collection and, while the previous album was mostly jazz with a tinge of country, this new CD is pretty much a country record with a tinge of jazz.With that said, this CD works much better than Jones' previous effort. It's more fluid and captivating, and her singing is more expressive and tender. Also, the instrumentation is a bit more daring, and the songs have a lot more meat on the bones. Choice cuts include ""Toes,"" ""Be Here To Love Me"" and ""What Am I To You.""Although this album contains a misguided, odd-duck duet with Dolly Parton on ""Creepin' In,"" it is still a luxurious, gorgeous collection that is certain to please most Norah Jones fans."
5,Surprised,"I'm glad I didn't take too seriously the many reader reviews that were disappointed in this follow up cd. I think it is far superior to the first cd, more complex and nuanced and far less sleep inducing. Highly enjoyable. Norah has the smoothest voice around."
4,It grew on me,"This cd took more than a few listens to grow on me. Now I think it's a very good cd. Songs like ""sunrise or Humble me"" are perfect night time songs. Feels like home has more of a country feel to it and is very consistent in quality. It's cool to finally have a young muscian who has talent. It's very rare these days."
5,"Great,relaxing music","I totally fell in love with this album,I think it is so much better than Norah's debut album/although I loved Come away with me as well/.Her voice,her piano play are still beautiful,and she has grown a lot,I think.You can feel that on the whole album.It's very relaxing,worth listening,simply just a fantastic album.Buy it!Eszter from Hungary"
2,A tolerable misstep,"Norah apparently likes country/bluegrass music, all fine and good. The problem is that she hasn't learned how to or simply can't let her voice shine in that genre of music. Her voice has this rare intimate quality that works best in jazz or blues, or music with those types of hooks like ""Those sweet words"" and ""What am I to You"". But listen to ""Creepin In"", she gets blown out of the water by Dolly Parton (who I don't even like) so much so you don't even want to hear Norah sing again. So it goes with most of the CD until the last ""I Don't Miss You At All"" a jazz standard that although she heatbreakingly missinterprets, comes out fine. Norah is a young singer who I'm sure is completely unaware of what it is about her voice that is so special, therefore she doesn't nurture it and it hurt her on this CD."
3,sick and tired of protected CDs,"I don't understand why this CD is rated 'Enhanced' rather than 'Content Protected'. I cannot play it in my computer, and I cannot transfer songs from it to my phone. I'm sorry I paid good money for this disc, and I'm doing my best not to buy 'protected' CDs from ANY artist. Can't Amazon clearly label such CDs, so I can buy others instead?"
5,Unbelievable!!!!!!,"This CD is absolutly amazing!! A mix of jazz, country, blues, and folk! It don't get much better than this!!! Don't listen to other reviews, for they are not true music lovers and don't understand the talent Norah Jones has!!!"
3,What&#65533;s the Big Deal?,"I picked up this cd at a bargain price because of all the, ""Norah Jones this, and Norah Jones that,"" I've been reading, and like many other Amazon.com reviewers, I am under whelmed.""Feels Like Home,"" is mellow, and forgettable. Though Ms. Jones's voice is adequate, and the band is good nothing reached out and grabbed me with a ""hey, pay attention,"" energy, or even riff.""Feels Like Home,"" feels like fine background music - if you like that sort of thing - or rainy day take-a-nap music, but I don't think it's going to get many spins out of me."
5,It Really Feels Like Home,"The first time I heard Norah Jones was from a little 30 second snippet online of her first video from her first album. I was hooked, and immediately grabbed my keys and went to my nearest record store to buy it. I really enjoyed her first album, and this one is just as good. The song with Dolly Parton is really fun and cute."
4,Feels Like Come Away With Me,"Norah Jones - Feels Like Home (Blue Note, 2004)If you loved Come Away With Me, then you'll love this album too because it's practically the same album, just not without a noticeable hit like ""Don't Know Why"". Similar to India.Arie's sophomore album, don't expect a significant growth in Jones's songwriting and performance because it's only been a short time between this album and her last. This album still has highlights aplenty like ""What Am I To You?"" and the Dolly Parton duet, ""Creepin' In"". Norah Jones has bypassed the sophomore jinx with this one. -EJR"
2,It goes downhill past song #5...,"Norah Jones' latest effort was dissapointing to say the least. I felt there was potential to her when I listened to her first album, but after listening to this album certainly I am not ""feeling the same way."" The first few songs stand out, but in general the album is (yes, you've heard it before) booooring and repetitive. It's hard to put your finger on almost any song after the fifth track because they all sound very similar and, in a way, dull. ""The Prettiest Thing"" and the closing Ellington song ""Don't Miss You At All"" are the only other songs that stand out in the second half of the album: the rest I can totally live without. Granted I loved the use of electric piano on some of the tracks, giving them a bit of an edge, overall I don't see this as more than a two-star album. I recommend Jacqui Naylor's 'Shelter' -far better!"
3,Only if you are motivated...,"After Come Away With Me, I have to confess that Feels Like Home is a little disapointing. I love the song Sunrise but after that first song, it gets a little repetitive as you go along and it is hard to keep your interest after a while. This, on the other hand, does make it a good CD to play in the background while doing work or something. It won't distract you and you can stay focused. I feel that the CD is a good investment if you are someone who is patient enough to grow to like a CD, instead of tossing it on the shelf after one play."
3,Copy controlled by EMI,"The album wasn't bad on first listening, but then I tried to rip it so I could listen on my MP3 player. It failed after track one due to the ""Copy Controlled"" format that my CD came in. It is going right back to where I bought it. Perhaps Amazon can comment and highlight in the future when a CD is ""Copy Controlled"" because I won't be buying any more CD's that are set up with this built-in problem. If Amazon's version of this album include EMI's copy protection, I recommend staying far away."
5,Best Of Today,"Norah Jones is one of the best singers in the business today. Her approach to a song and musical ability should lift her to be one of the few artists that we will be seeing and remembering on VH1 retro shows in years to come. She didn't sell out on her new album and stayed true to herself. No overproduction, no dance beats, just a great voice and a great CD. This kind of talent has staying power and everyone will be seeing her around for a long long time."
2,Doesn't feel like home,"I was very dissappointed in this much anticipated release. Each piece on ""Come Away With Me"" was distinct and memorable and could stand on its own merit. On this CD, the selections blend together, in a not very appealing way. I found myself getting bored and skipping to the next track to see if there was a pleasant surprise waiting. Usually, there was not. The tone of the CD was rather downbeat. ""Sunrise"" is nice, but even though I'm a Dolly Parton fan, I did not like the duet ""Creepin' In"". There was just too much sameness on this CD, and nothing seized my attention or emotions. Also missing was much of Norah's distinctive piano playing. My recommendation is to stay with the first CD and wait for the third."
4,Listen twice before giving up!,"If I'd reviewed this CD after the first listening, it would have one star only. My wife (h-u-g-e Nora fan!) would agree.After the second listen, our review goes up another 3 stars. Why? It's hard to explain but this CD's music is different in many ways from the first with an intentional country twang sound in there and yet... at the second listen, we began to like it! After 3 times, we're fans once again."
4,Great Album,"I don't have the ""Come Away with Me"" album, so there's no way I could compare the two.Nonetheless ""Feels Like Home"" is an instant favorite.I know there are some who won't consider Norah Jones a jazz singer, and that's alright with me. To me it's always the music that counts, regardless of the genre.""Feels Like Home"" is simple and rich, soft and sweet. I'd listened to the entire four time since I bought it yesterday.My most favorite tracks are (so far)SUNRISE; THOSE SWEET WORDS; THE LONG WAY HOME; THE PRETTIEST THING; TOES.It's definitely not easy to make an album like this, without the big powerful guitars, booming bass, thundering drums and all those studio gizmos, you really need a lot of talent, hardwork and heart to pull it off.And these days, good, let alone great, music is hard to come by. I'm happy to have stumnbled on this one."
4,Usual Fare,"New albums or books by an artist or writer who've had a rave review for their previous effort always make me wonder two things1. will it be as good as the old one?2. are all the raves i see for the second time just an obligatory rave influenced in part by the hype from the old albumI wouldn't call this album anything to rave about really. Its her usual method and style, just like in the past album. Peaceful, calming and soothing. In a way, in our hectic world, filled with screaming music, it does make her album stick out, in a good way. Its a good album to come back to and unwind, just before bed, or if you've had a particularly frustrating day. However if you thought her first effort was undeserving of all the Grammy's she won, don't bother with this one."
4,Life must suck,"The things people are saying! WOW! Y'all are extremely negative and angry about this record-don't take it so personally. AND, on that note, the guy who talks about Norah JOnes not caring about her fans??? Do you KNOW her personally. LOOK folks, musicians don't write music for YOU, they write it for themselves,it's their catharsis NOT yours. If it happens to move you, cool. This ,as all things Ms. Jones has done in the past, personally- MOVED me regardless of how ""mellow"", ""quiet"", ""boring"", ""country crap"", y'all thought it was. I am as impressed as before AND, I have superb taste in music. Sorry all you other folks are so disappointed, life must suck right now for a lot of you!"
1,Expect the expected,"In a word, tepid. Record labels and big-time publishers spend tons of money to tell us who to like. You'd think they could afford to find the best of the best, but instead we get a halcion cover act like Norah Jones pushed on us in every outlet store, every bank, dentist office, funeral home, you name it.As expected of a multiple Grammy-winning debut phenomenon, Jones is joined on her sophmore release by a bunch of hacks (including one of my former heroes, Dolly Parton) who for whatever reason are routinely convinced to latch on to the new so-and-so like so many algae to so many fungi.The result? A dreary, mid-tempo exhalation of dead hits, re-worked in the style of wonder bread soul. I have nothing against Norah Jones' music, save its Big Brotherly pervasiveness and its exhausting lack of originality and charm."
2,"Dissapointing, lukewarm","I agree with the reviewers that found the album dissapointing and quite boring. It is pleasant to the ear, but that's about it."
2,Boring songs fall flat....,"I loved Norah's debut CD. Yes, her voice was original and touching, but the material on it was OUTSTANDING! Her 2nd CD shows how emberrasing it can be to release an album with BORING, ordinary lamea** songs!! They are such uninteresting material, and a bit too country!! Some songs sound like kindergarden songs!! Not even her voice can carry this one.The production team obviously didn't want to mess with a winning formula, but why burn it to the ground??I've read reviews about the other EP album she did with Peter Malick, which was clearly recorded before she reached stardom. I happen to like it more than this 2nd album. Check it out."
2,I need a nap,Oh God...wife...playing...Norah Jones CD again...so dull...and...unimaginative...eyelids...getting heavy...IQ decreasing...can't go on...typing...much longer...must...play...Meshuggah..........................
2,I Cannot Resist Quoting This Review From England,". . . ""The rest wafts discreetly around the room like something manufactured by Airwick. Don't Know Why, the best-known track from Come Away With Me, had an undeniable melody: you might not have liked it, but it was impossible to dislodge from your head. There's nothing similar here. In fact, Feels Like Home is so inoffensive you have trouble remembering whether you put it on.""""You suspect that this is the appeal for the millions of people who buy this kind of thing. They are past the point of wanting to be moved or inspired by rock and pop. Instead they treat music as something ornamental, something with which you can tastefully decorate your home. Beautifully produced and beautifully played to no cumulative effect whatsoever, this album fits the bill perfectly.""-Alexis PetridisFriday February 6, 2004The Guardian"
4,"Mellow, unmemorable - and eclipsed.","If *only* Vienna Teng's sophomore album hadn't also come out around the same time, NJ might have escaped unscathed by comparison. As it was, the contrast was too stark and glaring.I longed to love it, played it often in the hopes that some hook or phrase would lodge in the memory - but nothing. Hélas."
4,4 only because it's not as good as the first!,"This is a great CD, I love it! Not as much as I love Come away with me though... So seeing as Come away with me would get the full 5 stars and then some... I had to only give this one 4."
3,"Could have been magic, but........","Well, having been a huge fan of Norah's first album, I can attest to how disappointed I was in this one. It does have its moments, such as ""Those Sweet Words,"" and ""Don't Miss You At All."" Those two songs are golden and show that shadow of her former self we loved. This album, however, has descended the bar from beautiful jazz piano to twangy country-esque music. As always, lyrically she astounds, but the songs themselves leave something wanting.Though I miss the old sound, this album overall isn't bad. But, as I said, it does just leave that feeling of something missing."
3,Sedate!,"I recently lost my tranquilizer pills to keep me calm, but as it turns out, this Norah Jones CD is the perfect fixx!! She has a tried-n-true voice that really keeps me on balance. I saw her perform on Saturday Night Live, and the results were stunning. I can't believe she's not more popular.If you're looking for relaxation, this is the one!!Have a peaceful night!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,the album before Norah was NORAH,"She brings her country root this time, but waaay to many.Guess this album was meant to be the anti-climax of her groundbreaking ""Come away with me"".Nevertheless, the die-hard fans would really enjoyed her tunes."
2,A Very Disappointed Fan,"I was a devoted fan of Norah's. I have all her albums. But recently, I have become very disappointed with her current albums. I'am a jazz devotee. When I counted all the reviewers who share my disappontment with this latest album, I decided to look for an up and coming jazz vocalist who sings, plays, composes jazz. I was lucky to find such a singer at the jazz festivals I attended. Let me introduce you to Dena Derose, who I think is everything that Norah is not. ""Love's Holiday"" is an extremely satisfying, refreshing CD. Her signature sound is vocalizing her piano solos or scatting with her swinging piano solos. Her voice is crystalline in sound, with impeccable jazz phrasing where she can easily change keys or slide through the bars with horn-like pacing. She has an outstanding backup group that she has organized. DeRose has arrived. I guarantee there won't be one disappointed jazz fan of Dena Derose. Win me back Diana.."
2,Commercialization kills a star,"When I bought her `Come Away with Me' album, I enjoyed the non-commercialized rich jazz-like music she produced.Unfortunately, she has now entered the world of pop stardom and this reflects in `Feels like Home'. This offering has ventured too far towards `country' to be called jazz / soul. I'm sure it will still sell a couple of million copies based on the expectation one had following `Come Away with Me', Next time, I will first listen to the CD in the music shop before buying it. Her music has gone from being excellent to being mediocre at best.I have to give this CD a qualified thumbs down."
2,I like Norah but this album isent clicking...,"I enjoyed Come Away With Me it was an ok album!I was exspecting her to top that album but I don't think that happened,This album is not even ok its like a bunch of fillers not single worthy a bit!I like Sunrise and thats all and Im upset because I was exspecting so much better!If you wanna check out good album's check out these!#1 In The Zone - Britney Spears#2 Come Away With Me - Norah Jones#3 The Very Best of Sheryl Crow - Sheryl CrowThose are my top 3 album's at the moment for me!"
1,annoyed,"I have just brought a new Norah Jones CD and I can't get the stupid Copy Control Licence agreement stuff to work. I can't play my CD.What I would also like to know is what happens if my computer is not connected to the internet!!!This is ridiculous - I purchase the CD I should be able to play it without being treated like a criminal. I will never buy another CD that has ""Copy Controlled"" written on it.I get a site that says it will go live soon - so what happens to me in the mean time - just wait until you have your site live and then I'm allowed to play my CD - if I purchase something I expect to be able to enjoy it.VERY UNSATISFIED CUSTOMERJayne"
2,a snoozer,"Wonderful intimate voice,great musical heritage, extremely monotonous songs....great if your trying to lower your bloodpressure or achieve REM state. This ain't jazz it's elevator music."
3,"Melodious, soulful, but not very diverse","Norah plays more original music this time around, and the results are a beautiful, melodious album. There is excellent, restrained playing here although I'm surprised they don't vary the tempos a little more. Those who call it elevator music, though, just aren't listening. There's a lot to recommend in Norah's sound. Now to work on those lyrics . . .And for Evan Mahaney (below), Robbie Williams isn't huge in the States because his music and singing are laughable. He's ambitious, but ultimately a middle-of-the-pack talent."
2,Nothing to write home about,"I like Norah's debut album, but I am far from a huge fan of her music. Ms. Jones returns to the music scene with nothing new to offer her fans, which isn't surprising. Her voice, while beautiful, has absolutely no range or emotion, like Sarah McLachlan's voice does in her live concerts. If you want something to relax to, ""Feels Like Home"" will satisfy you. If you want something fairly interesting and appealing, buy something else."
1,Boycot Microsoft,What's all this nonsense about CD that cannot be played in car stereos??!!! I bought N Jones' latest CD (paid premium price for it!) only to find that it won't play in my car stereo. And we're not talking about a cheap stereo here. We're talking about an Audi sound system.I spend lots of time in my car and I want my CDs to play there as well as in other places.This is just one more example of the disgusting dominance of Microsoft!! Why include a Microsoft player in an audio CD??! Why can't the cosumer have the liberty to play CDs with whichever player s/he chooses to use??!!This is outrageous!
1,Do you like country music?,"If you do, you will probably enjoy this album. I am a jazz fan and was very disappointed with Feels Like Home. I managed to listen to the entire album by hoping that there would be one track that I could enjoy. ""Sunrise"" is not bad but it goes downhill from there. I wish I had read a review like this and saved my money."
2,Went out of her talent and range,"The point of trying new things is to progress as an artist, but I felt very little progression on Norah's part.The lyrics have regressed, the spirit I heard in her voice and tone in her first album, lost.This CD felt more a response to mass market appeal. Norah is catering to a new segment that subjectively is beyond me - country. Some people may think of a duet with Dolly Parton as artistic, but hardly do.Hopefully in her next album she will return to the spirit of thought she evoked before - that of a wistful loneliness, of the murky depths of a dim nightlife, and build on that."
1,Major disappointment,"I REALLY loved ""Come Away With Me"" and eagerly awaited Jones' next CD. Her sultry, smokey voice is alive and well. It's the material that kills this new CD. You could just fall asleep listening to it -- and not in a good way -- out of boredom. I'm just completely disappointed. There isn't a single track that measures up to anything from her first CD. She needs SONGWRITERS -- fast. I'd hate to think of her as a one-CD wonder."
1,The French Clap for Anything,"Who can go through this album more than once without gagging, falling asleep or shooting themselves of boredom? Thanks Snorah...........The Good News is: I saved $100 on my car insurance with the Gecco..............PS: Get Dena DeRose's ""Love's Holiday"" You won't gag, fall asleep or shoot. You will just have a unique jazz experience."
2,Snore-ah does it again!!!!,"All I know is when they put the children down for their naps at my son's day care they play this cd. That's the only reason I dowloaded, oops I mean own this cd...."
1,This Cd sucks!!,Norah Jones straight up sucks. I don't see what the big deal is about her. I wouldn't pay a dollar for this album. Don't waste your money on this trash.
3,She writes two of the songs on the album.,"Just like her first CD, this CD is written almost entirely by her band members. Does this bother anyone else? I feel like especially with the type of music she's playing, playing other people's songs isn't what it's all about. A lot of musicians are good at piano and have a beautiful voice, but not all of them can write great songs -- and Norah Jones isn't one of the ones who can write great songs (only a good songs that is)."
2,"oh, was that it?","and halfway through the first track, darkness came over me as I felt my head hit the pillow, while Norah Jones' sultry voice echoes through my head ...""Sunrise sunrise ... ,"""
2,"Absolute crap, just like the last one...","You can definitely tell she listened to the critics with this new CD. She writes her own songs, and it shows. Cliched lyrics (deep blue sea, butterflies, etc...). She is not the ""indy"" darling, Blue Note is owned by Capitol. She has a great voice, but has definitely been marketed to the birkenstock baby boomer crowd and has benefitted from that. Put this next to your Enya CDs on the shelf."
3,"Actually like the music, very poor recording though","Unlike a lot of reviews of less than 5 starts, I enjoy the music on this CD. If you enjoy the sound of Norah's voice, you'll like the CD if you can put up with: The recording quality of this CD is horrible. Most songs have clipping or distortion no matter what system I play it on. The higher the end system the more obvious the recording has issues. If I wanted a low quality version of her music I would have just downloaded it from iTunes."
3,Disappointing,"How can you top ""Come Away With Me""? I still listen to this amazing CD like I am hearing it for the first time. When I saw the new Norah Jones ""Feels Like Home"", I immediately purchased it, excited for another work like ""Come Away With Me"". To no avail. The songs are nice enough, but not memorable. Where I cannot stop listening to ""Come Away With Me"", I can easily turn off ""Feels Like Home"" and move on to something else. There is a mishmash of songs - they don't seem to flow together. Disappointing. I can only hope that her next release will be more like her first."
1,Seriously not worth 12 dollers!,"This is the most horrible Album of 2004 and I can't belive I bought it!I wanted too see what all the fuss was albout this album so I got it and Im so upset I lost my money's worth.The songs are bad,the toons are awful,and Norah's voice is very tiring.And also there is Spyware on this CD which means if you place this disc in your computer it will mess it up grrrrrrrrr Im so mad so I thought I should give peeps second thoughts before getting such an album!"
1,ENHANCED Means It Might Not Play On Your CD Player,"This is an Enhanced Compact Disc (ECD), which means there is a mix of data and music files on the disc. An ECD is not a compliant Compact Disc under the Philips standard (as evidenced by the lack of the Compact Disc logo on the CD and CD case). It should play on most CD players, but not all (it won't on my Aiwa ACD-300).Note that Amazon will not refund your purchase if it doesn't play on your CD player."
2,"I'm sorry, but it's dull.","I have to join the chorus and tell the truth. These songs are well crafted, layered, sophisticated... and boring. It starts off with ""Sunrise,"" the only worthwile tune on the CD (and the only reason I gave this two stars). Then, well, it just get's bland and stays that way for the rest of the cd. It isn't that the songs all sound alike; they're just not that interesting. And they get even less interesting with repeated plays. If this cd were food, it would be flavorless oatmeal - no cream, no brown sugar, no raisins... just blah."
2,What a disappointment!,"Love Norah Jones and have several of her CDs, but this one was a big disappointment. Can we say boring? And I've never heard of most of these songs and they were not interesting and the performance was lack luster. Would not recommend."
3,Norah Jones CD,"So long ago, I have no idea whether it is a success, but certainly family member in US likes this artist"
5,FORK!!!,"all of me hyde sinks one into the nether-regions of one mister cyrus rex. produced along with help from a wild assortment of nefarious gasses, this is a journey into juices not yet classified by ancient or modern clergy. blister pops carry the mindset while the electrifying play-dough heavens open up into worm tubes, providing massages in places i can't mention for fear of over-exposure. explosions of flatulence and peanut butter (compressed) add just the right amount of bite to an otherwise more sterile carbonated pork mix. oh the cows do come home in this work, squeezing a cheese that leaves only the slightest hint of sharpness, much like that found when licking the edge of a piece of quality paper repeatedly. it left me bruised and beaten, shaken (not stirred), leaving me feeling generally satisfied in a pool of my own insides."
3,"Review For Nora Roberts "" Irish Series""","I am a Huge fan of Nora Roberts- and writing as JD Robb. But I have found I just don't find the "" Series of "" Irish Based Books"". To my enjoyment. As I have most all of her other books. I will continue to check out any new material she offers- she is one of the most talented writers- I have found- and I have become totally taken by the Eve Dallas Series. And can't wait for the next issue. My statement is just my opinion and certainly doesn't criticize anyone who does enjoy these books. As the saying goes "" To Each His Own""."
2,Irish Thoroughbred,"I thought it would be in better shape. According to the description the binding had wear, but other than that it was good. It was more than a simple bend and it looked to have been used numerous times. I realize it is an older book, but the product description should have been more accurate."
3,Good popular history review of the Black Rock region.,"This book covers the history of the Black Rock Desert region near Gerlach, Nevada from roughly 10,000 BC until the early 1970s.The writing style is a little stilted, but this book is a quick read. The longest chapter discusses the war with the Paiute Indians, but there is also discussion of some of the mining activity, and an excellent chapter about the ranchers of the area.It would be nice to see this book updated to include more information about the founding of Gerlach, and to discuss some of the activities of the 70's and 80's.If you've been to Burning Man, and are wondering about the history of the area, then this is the book for you."
3,Neither a Great Bell nor a Functional Compass,"Not surprisingly, this is neither a great bell nor a functional compass. The compass, in particular, worked fine at first, but then -- suddenly and for the reasons I do not understand -- showed directions exactly opposite to those it should show. It is very unstable and only produces a clear reading when the bike is at rest. On the good side, the article is very fairly priced."
3,Not bad,"This is very much as described. However, the one thing I don't like is that the compass (which works just fine) is set up so that it shows the direction you're coming from. That is to say, when you mount it correctly, and say you're facing north, the South pole of the compas is facing you so you're reading the direction you're coming from, not where you're headed. This could confuse the dim-witted!!!! :-)"
2,wouldn't buy again,"I received this bell about 9 months ago. I bike every day to work and thus I've used the bell quite a bit and am very familiar with it. I like the timbre of the bell and the loudness -- this was great. However, after 9 months, through rain and muck, the ringer mechanism has already rusted and broken. So it's no longer a bell. The compass is one of the crappiest compasses I've ever had (and hardly useful). So I love the idea of a dual purpose bell, but I think this one fails in both regards."
3,"Cute, but clumsy","A great idea, having a magnetic compass, and mount for bicycle handlebars. The bell is a bit...dull, not the traditional ring to it. Overall, good value."
3,Okay,"It was as advertised. Easy to attach. I found the compass to work correctly. The only negative is the plastic gong that rings the bell. It feels really flimsy, like it could break easily. To be fair, I have had it only a short time and it works fine so far but I have the fear it might not last."
1,cheap. boring,Not impressed at all with this device. Title says it all. Looks cheap and feels cheap. Returned as it wasn't what I had hoped
1,el cheapo,crap compass and dull bell.pretty disappointing. not worth returning for credit.go with the old school mechanical ringer bells. this is asian junk.
2,Not very good,"I purchase this book because of my interest in the 1970s Ranchero - particularly the `72 and '77-79s. However, I found the information being sparse. It seems to cater toward young readers with a passing interest for these vehicles, not serious enthusiasts. Each year of the Ranchero is presented with a brief description. The writing is quite dry with much of the material disclosing options, color choices, dimensions, and sales figures. Photos are all in black and white. Mays shows little objectivity in his writing and throws accolades at every Ford or Ranchero product. In quite a few places, he mentions the superiority of the Ranchero over the El Camino. I remembered reading some absurd piece of writing that mentioned buyers flocking to the Ranchero in 1973 because of the energy crisis! This book, even at the discounted price of 18.96, is too expensive. Only get it if you are a die-hard Ranchero fan or want to complete your automobile book library."
5,AC Smart,"This is an excellent book for anyone with even a passing interest in the history of Allis-Chalmers and the establishment of the early American farm machinery industry. Easy to read and very informative. Loaded with facts, figures, and pictures; this book should be required reading for anyone who loves farm machinery of any brand."
5,An incredible album!,"This CD is one of the best bluegrass albums ever released. Compiling two CDs, a listener is treated to 22 tracks, all of which are astounding both vocally and instrumentally. A key ingredient to the success and popularity of Doyle Lawson and Quicksilver (no matter who joins or leaves the band) is Mr. Lawson's intrepid ability to choose songs and arrange them beautifully, without regard to genre. The exceptional redition of ""Yellow River"", originally recorded and released by the '70's rock band Christie, stands as a prime example. But regardless of which genre they sample from, Doyle Lawson & Quicksilver remain true bluegrass artists, deftly making use of both delicate harmonies and really fast pickin'! A standout album!"
5,"A FRESH voice, thank the GODDESS!","The raw reality of this book and Kenney's ability to relay her unusual college experiences made me laugh, cry and cringe for hours. No typical ""gen-exer,"" Ms. Kenney has a sleeper hit on her hands here. (I attended a 'reading' of hers recently and it was well worth the time!) The world will be hearing more from this young talent, I'm sure."
4,"How a nice girl, well...","..as she says, maybe she's not so nice. But Ms. Kenney is forthright and nonjudgmental, which counts for more than a little. At bottom (take it how you will), this brief sketch tells the story of a tomboy who became a young woman, and lived an interesting life in the process.Ms. Kenney provides a clear window into a subculture that most of us know about in only the most veiled way. More important, she is honest in her response to it, and develops a sense of her own boundaries and limits without passing judgement on the needs of others. Her book avoids the trap of cheap voyeurism and makes for a refreshing read"
3,Over-rated,"A short, chatty book which you can reading in one sitting, fairly entertaining but with little style. The author, who was quite frankly into dominance purely for money, but she has little insight into the psychology of BDSM. In general she loathed her clients, with the odd exception of those such as Norman the bereaved husband; that may be understandable, given that she sees only the behaviour without trying to understand the motivation. Some of the things she writes about don't completely ring true - I wouldn't say that they are lies but I'd guess that they are slanted or exaggerated. Either way, Id say that this book will appeal more to the vanilla world, looking for a little excitement, than the BDSM world."
4,I Was a Teenage Dominatrix: A Memoir,"A very interesting read and insight into a world that I know nothing about (and in some cases, would rather prefer to think it didn't exist; some of the characters in this book are really disturbing). The first couple of chapters start out a little cold and distant as the author describes her childhood. But for the rest of the book she takes us through her journey into this lifestyle and does a good job of showing her emotional growth along the way. I was glad for that, rather than just fact-driven accounts, she describes her reactions to the situations she ends up in, which gave it some humanity. At just over 100 pages, I wish that it was a little longer and some of the stories were ""filled out"" a little more. I laughed, I cringed; it was a fun read! There's a lot of ""I was a stripper"" memoirs out, but I haven't found something like this before. Don't read if you are squeamish, though!"
4,Kingsters Unlimited,"Not your typical teenager for sure. A very interesting book. I don't think Shawana is ever going to be a soccer mom. A teenager with a very steely reserve. I admire she used what resources she could. Being thrown out of the house at such a young age and making a go to better herself is admirable. I wonder though, if seeing such a seedy side of men will skew her for life. I wish her the best of luck.This book certainly was incredible and very funny in many spots. As she said, she never did anything to these men they didn't want. One thing for sure, there are certainly many more kinksters out there than just me. I've never understood the whole Dom thing but to each there own. I'm glad she had limits and didn't cross the line into prostitution. Would it be fun to spend an evening with her just to listen to her stories. Incedible!!!"
5,Teenage dominatrix: A whip-cracking delight,Vivid account of an everyday girl with a secret identity. An autobiography that is full of heart with a great sense of humor. Ms. Kenney really shines here. She'll tickle your fetish to the very end. A must read.
4,Close to home...,"When I spotted the review in the Washington City Paper, I went out and got the book. When I read the book, I realized (much to my amusement) that I had gotten acquainted with Kenney while hanging out in the Crowbar.This is one of the better ""I worked in the sex industry"" memoirs around, precisely because Kenney seems to have gotten into and out of the industry relatively unscathed. Insightful and amusing, I would recommend it to anyone who is neither prudish or looking for cheap thrills."
5,Shawna Kenney Delivers - A Pitch Perfect Book,"I'm surprised at just how much I enjoyed Shawna Kenney's I Was a Teenage Dominatrix: A Memoir. Keeney is an immensely talented writer who weaves an extremely compelling and engaging tale that is focused and pitch perfectly paced. Using a combination of vivid language and well rounded characters Kenney writing is immerse, it's easy to get swept away with the universe she creates.There are so many traps and pitfalls with a book that deals with a sexual topic and Kenney is adept at navigating the story and the characters into a very real but not overly heady space. Everything in the book feels very real and not contrived, a level of honesty which serves the book extremely well. If you're even remotely curious about this book or the topic, I highly recommend picking I Was a Teenage Dominatrix: A Memoir up, it delivers and is well worth you time."
3,"Oh, for an editor or proofreader!","Chaplain Waite's book is worth reading as a firsthand account of the initial invasion of Iraq (Operation Iraqi Freedom) by a participant at the battlion level. It is also spiritually uplifting, because the same participant was there as a minister of the Gospel as well as a naval officer. The book is not easy to read, however, because it never passed through the hands of an editor or a proofreader. There is not a single page, of the almost 200 pages in the book, that does not have at least one misspelled or misused word; and many pages have several of each. There are also some bizarre anachronisms: for example, the soldiers of Iraq's official Army (before the collapse of Saddam's government)are consistently referred to as ""insurgents"" or ""rebels."" This inattention is annoying and distracting. A story worth telling--and this one certainly is--is worth some care in the telling."
2,athe artist's reality:philosophies of art,this is basically a personal journal. The artist's ruminations about art and life - very dry reading. Rothko often contradicts himself. There are several books available (such as those published by Taschen) which are much more readable and are filled with beautiful illustrations of the artist's work.
1,Bait and Switch?,"This is the first complaint on anything I have bought through Amazon. This product was fulfilled through 47th Street Photo. I specifically ordered it because it was advertised as Canon brand name products. When the order came, it was a Samsonite camera case (nice, but bigger than the Canon item), and ""off-brand"" batteries and charger, similar to ones that I've had trouble with in the past. It was specifically the Canon batteries I wanted, in addition to the case. I won't go through the return process, but I'll think twice before ordering something again not sent directly by Amazon."
5,"Good buy, very useful",The case protects the camera while in my purse quite well. The battery charger came in handy by the second day when the batteries that came with my camera ran out. The batteries recharge within a few hours and with twice as many as needed by my camera I can always take photos.
1,This is a scam,"[...]Better yet, spend a bit more at Radio Shack for a system that will handle different size batteries as well. This is a scam for suckers who think there is something uncompatible about one AA-battery versus another; thinking Canon makes a ""special"" battery only compatible with their camera (ha), they spend more than twice what they should. Don't be fooled."
3,"Case is well built, but the batteries are a scam","There is nothing defective or wrong with the kit. The case is nice (except that you will only be able to carry camera and maybe another card). The main issue is the batteries and charger which are very generic (nothing special). I would recommend not going with the Canon batteries and instead purchasing another readily available brand. In the end you will probably be much happier and will have saved money.I agree with most others that Canon really should have included these items with the A80.*Also... if you are purchasing a Canon camera and expecting it to be made in Japan... watch out! They have been switching production to China mid-stream. Mid-2004 all the A80s were showing up with Made in China labels. Many displays show the one made in Japan, but the box you get will probably contain one made in China. It may be perfectly fine, however just be informed."
2,Too expensive.,This kit is priced way too high. If you shop around you can find other NIMH battery chargers for a lower price and the batteries that are included often have a higher mAH rating. Some of the chargers even have a quick charge mode so you don't have to wait overnight for them to charge.There are also camera cases for specific model cameras that should fit those camera much better. The case for the Canon PowerShot A400/A410 is (at the time of this review) priced on Amazon at just under $6. It fits my PowerShot A410 camera perfectly and is well worth the price.
1,Waste of Money,It is a waste of your money to spend $40 for Canon Battery Charger.Best Option is to buy Sony Charger which comes with 4 AA batteries and buy the Camera cover which totals around $25 so that shipping is free.
3,Should have come with the camera,"I think it's a bit of a rip-off to make you buy this separate from the cameras. The case is attractive and well-made, but all it holds is the camera and maybe some extra batteries, although I suspect 4 extra AA's will be a tight fit in the one pocket in front, or in lieu of batteries, an extra compact flash card. My A70 came with 4 rechargeable AA's. They should really just put the case in with the camera and either include the charger too, or let people fend for themselves with buying some other manufacturer's battery recharger. Seems like a ploy to sell battery chargers to me. I could have bought a charger with batteries for the same price as this kit. I only bought this to get the case."
3,Book for school,"I bought the book for my Anthropolohy class. The book is not bad. It's a bunch of essays put together in this book. Some of them are interesting, others a little long."
4,A Unique Collection of Works,"The film scores of Dmitri Shostakovich are certainly not his best works, but they are definetly worth a look. There is a great range of music on this CD, from the joyful 'Tale of the Silly Little Mouse' to the harshness of 'Hamlet', and Chailly and his players give solid performances throughout. I wouldn't really recommend this as an introduction to Shostakovich's works, but if you're a fan, then it would make a great addition to your collection."
4,Track 25 is the best,"Shostakivich wrote some 'heavy' music, but in his better moments he wrote some beautiful melodies (e.g. The Jazz Suite) and film themes including The Tale of the silly little mouse'. What a pity that you have to wait until track 25 for the best piece - the Romance from the 'Gadfly' (Theme music from the BBC series 'Reilly, ace of spies'). The definitive recording of this piece was the version by the USSR Cinema Symphony Orchestra, with Khatchaturian conducting, but the version on this recording is also excellent."
5,"Over 1 year after I bought it, it's still working just like it should...",It did exact what it was intended to do. Nothing more and nothing less. Great product at a great price.
1,Jack that never was.,"Never worked. Simply,plug it in and get two options to plug into. It never worked. No dial tone through this device. If it wasn't so cheap, I would ask for a refund."
1,NOY a SPLITTER!,I wanted this splitter to be able to run both my computer AND Netflick at the same time .... It does NOT work! I can only get one side to work!
3,Not an internet splitter,"Should have known for the price I wasn't getting an Ethernet splitter but unfortunately I was lead wrong, still a good phone line duplex though."
3,connect phone to answering machine plug,The concept is good but I noticed that the plug wobbles in the phone line plug. Had to tape it in place.
5,Just What I Needed,This is a simple device that will allow you to connect two telephone lines into one wall outlet. I bought a new corded phone but did not have an outlet for it. So I set it beside my wireless phone and connected them both to the one existing outlet with this handy little device.
1,Didn't work at all !,"Maybe I just got a bad one. I had this sent as a gift with a cordless phone and it didn't work. I later made a visit out of state and took a replacement that did work. When I checked this one at home - No good! Looking closer, the molding was faulty. The brass connectors do not stick up far enought to make contact. Thus, no connection. GE should do better than this."
5,"Works perfectly, a little flimsy.","Would definitely buy this again, it does the job perfectly, however it is a little flimsy with flex at the wall and I'm concerned that it may break over time, however, this is purely speculative. I will update if it does in fact break and that would bring down the rating, however for the time being its a great price and does exactly what it should, can't give it less than five stars for that."
3,works - but barely!,After a recent blackout I decided to be more prepared and get a corded/landline phone. The location I need to put the corded phone would require a splitter so I ordered this adapter. When attached to the line the adapter causes a bit of a hissing on the line so the sound is not very clear.I've tested the phone(s) and line out so I know that it is actually the adapter causing the hiss. Not quite worth it to send back and it *does* work so I'll probably look for something else of better quality locally.
1,Don't waste your money,"You will be lucky indeed if this product lasts a year before either it starts leaking or the aereater breaks off. I made a big mistake when I thought I would save money by buying a multi pack of replacement filters. I've ended up purchasing two additional faucet mounts just to use up the filters. On the positive side, Customer Service is very cooperative about sending replacement parts when it breaks in less than a year."
4,dr. chud rocks!,this album has strong music and good enough vocals--if you like american psycho u will like this
3,NOT BAD BUT NOT GREAT,"I WAS SO HAPPY WHEN I HEARD THE NEWS OF DR CHUD PUTTING OUT THIS CD. WHEN HE CAME TO CANADA I MADE SURE I SAW HIM LIVE AND HE DID NOT DISSAPOINT. HOWEVER WITH THIS ALBUM IT WAS A LITTLE BIT OF A LET DOWN AS IT'S NOT THAT GREAT, IT'S NOT BAD JUST NOT GREAT. IT HAS FOUR GREAT SONGS AND FOUR SO SO SONGS. BLUE SKIN, MOMMY MADE LUV TO AN ALIEN AND SPIDERBABY ARE SIMPLY WORKS OF ART. CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEXT ONE WHICH I KNOW IS BEING WORKED ON NOW. IF YOUR A DR CHUD FAN PICK IT UP OTHERWISE IT'S BETTER SEEING THE GOOD DOCTOR LIVE..SEE YA IN THE PIT"
2,"Where's the pulse, Doc?","I'd probably give this closer to 1.5 stars, but I rounded up.This is a really short album, with only 8 songs, and of those songs, there are a few that I just couldn't tolerate, like ""Heavy Metal"" and ""Powerless,"" while the others were okay, but nothing special. The entire album just seems a little cheesy: the music, the lyrics, everything. I know that horrorpunk is supposed to be fun, but there's a difference between fun and corny, and clearly the Doc doesn't get it.I have to add that I'm a fan of Misfits (both Glenn and Graves eras), and followed Graves' and CHUD's careers pretty steadily. This album is just a weak entry into CHUD's resume, and to horrorpunk in general."
5,One of the funnest albums out there,"This album is awsome, because its so unique. When I heard Dr chud had his own album, i expected basically more of his brutal druming. I couldnt have been more wrong, as Dr Chud steps into the spotlight, singing and playing guitar for this album, which is both suprising and impressive. Dr Chud provides some of the most energetic, catchy, and fun songs in recent memory. Tracks such as BlueSkin and Rabid touch on some of the misfits mindset, but with a unique take and delivery. Other songs such as Bury you alive , Mommy made luv 2 an alien, and Goodbye are stupidly fun, catchy songs. With this album, Dr Chud shows exactly where the quirkyness and humor of the ressurected misfits came from, and delivers even more corny, cheesy fun. Though not as dark or heavy as his work with the misfits, this is an energetic, fun, unique ""horror"" punk album. Personally I liked every track on this album. The album is short, but you will want to let it play it over and over."
5,5 Stars for the good Doctor!,"Well gang, I had the good fortune and the great pleasure of seeing and hanging out with Dr. Chud's X-Ward LIVE last night. I have to say, it was the most fun I can remember having at a show. The guys rocked with unmatched energy. Here is a hardworking, down to Earth bunch of guys if ever there was. I highly recommend that you catch these guys if you can. You'll have a blast!The CD is alot of fun(I'm particularly enjoying ""Spiderbaby"" as I am currently reading book 7 of Stephen King's ""the Dark Tower"" series and there just happens to be a Half human/half spider baby in there.) The packaging is nice and includes a neat mini-comic. Perfect for that Halloween party or anytime you need a rockin' Horror-Punk fix. I highly recommend ""Diagnosis for Death.""Check out the band's site for more info: http://www.drchudsxward.com/Ehren"
5,Top Class Reggae,"Excellent compilation of Hardcore roots songs, High Grade material.Sought after album for serious collectors of hard to find Reggae music."
4,Nice for shoes,"My son requested these for Christmas. He had them on his wish list on Amazon. I ordered them and he was excited to get them, but they did take a long time to get here. They did post that they would arrive late. Which they did. It turned out to be an after Christmas gift."
5,Very nice model,"This is a very well done and highly detailed model of a 57 Ford Thunderbird. The hood, trunk and doors open. The steering wheel turns the front wheels. The engine under the hood is very detailed as well. There is an add-on hard top packaged in the display package. Nice car, you'll like it. I was more than pleased."
4,Wrong color.,"I am overall pleased with the model but it came in black not the blue-grey shown. Hate the wheels, not beefy enough for the weight of the car. Just wish sellers would make a statement that the car is not the color shown. I probably would not have bought another black one had I known."
2,Beautiful T-Bird. For about Five Minutes,"This model would be great for a collector. One of those people who wants everything to stay in its perfect packaging. Within five minutes of opening the box, my teenaged son brought the car to me with parts broken off. He is not a rough player, but I think this toy is not for children. It was beautiful and had incredible detail before it self-destructed."
1,Bootleg,"As everyone has said, this IS a bootleg. Only one company has EVER done universal release DVDs that were ligit, and they went under. Bleach is NOT one of their titles. Thus, you have the first clue that it is a bootleg. The second clue is, the fact that Rukia is spelled Lukia. If a company in Japan wanted to mechandize their stuff so it was international released, they would take time to garantee the quality, but the fact that there are other errors in there, is the second clue. I am writing this review, so people don't buy this, and go and support Tito Kubo the right way."
2,Quality,"What ppl really need to know about this product is not if it's a bootleg or not, but the actual quality. The translation is really rough, it seems to be a literal translation instead of working english and can get confusing at times. The image quality is sub-par and doesn't seem up to dvd standards. That said, if you can't afford this many episodes (I got 4 discs 95 episodes) you might have try to make it work. All in all i was still a bit disappointed."
1,It's a bootleg,"Region free means bootleg. You're wasting your money on pirated goods. The official DVD release is the region 1 released by Viz.In comparison, look at this boxset. It doesn't list the company that made it. Doesn't say if it has subtitles. Doesn't say what the play time is. If you want to spend money on something that you know nothing about, you're just ripping yourself off."
1,Bootleg,"This item is a bootleg product. Do not purchase this, if you want to support the true creators."
4,An Excellent Book,"I enjoyed ""The White Tribe"" greatly. It is very well-written and the history that it is based on is extremely interesting (it's a fictionalized account of the author's experiences in the Rhodesian war). It's a pity that it's out of print. However, I do have one problem with it. The author portrays Rev. Andrew Young as a homicidal race-baiting nut case who calls the Republicans in the USA, the Rhodesian whites, and everyone else he disagrees with ""Fascists"" and ""racists"" and rails about how all American whites secretly support white rule in Africa. Although Rev. Young supported some causes that were not worthy of the support of a man of his moral standing (Robert Mugabe and Communist-directed army, basically), he is not the lunatic portrayed in the book. I recommend ""The White Tribe"" to any interested in a good war story and/or history."
5,The Three Sides of Ansir,"Ever wondered if anyone *really* understood you, or if you could *really* understand yourself? Wonder no more. ""Three Sides of You"" is beyond Myers-Briggs or IQ tests. Sandra Seich's book examines how you think, how you work, and how you feel--the three sides of you--and shows how each of these separate parts work to create the ""whole"" you. After taking the test the ""Three Sides of You"" book will reveal a deeper part of yourself in an amazing way. You'll never see yourself, or others, the same way again."
5,One of the very best Francis biographies,"This is a definitive biography of St. Francis, placing his life in context of his cultural and religio-political times as few have done before. Spotto takes advantage of the most recent work of Franciscan scholars to piece together a wonderful, complex, historically accurate image of St. Francis and his radical gospel charism.However many Francis biographies you may have read, this one will offer you insights and facts you haven't come across before...unless you're one of those Franciscan scholars listed in Spotto's excellent bibliography -- or have worked your way through all three of those fat volumes of the new ""Omnibus."" As a Secular Franciscan, I've read dozens of Francis books over the past thirty-plus years, but I couldn't put this one down.If Franciscans had a required reading list (unthinkably un-Franciscan!), this book should be at the very top of it."
3,Falls Short,"I hate to write this, but I have to be honest. This book is nicely written, but it really tells us nothing about the real Francis - the human being behind all the myth and fanciful legend. Perhaps that is simply not possible to do, since all the source material is written by purveyors of the Francis cult. But there are so many imponderables, so many holes in the popular story of his life...yet this author doesn't even adopt a skeptical approach."
1,What the.....???,As a student of a Franciscan University the Francis Donald Spoto writes about is far from the reality of the great St Francis. Very anti-Catholic summary of the life of such a great believer in the Church of Christ. Sad book to read.
5,Creates an image of a very human Saint,"I've read many books on Saint Frances and this is the first that created an image of a man with all of the struggles of life, yet inspired by God to change. The change or conversion that Donald Spoto creates in his ""Reluctant Saint,"" truly brings out the life-long process that Frances underwent, even until his last days. A very readable book."
5,The Language of a Saint,"What makes a good biography? Intellectual excellence, purity and modesty. What makes a good Saint? Purity of heart. I find this book to be the greatest biography I have ever read. The author is as unconscious in the beauty of his writing as St. Francis was radiant in his charm. Qualities we can all aspire to. A must read for all who wish to know about the life of Francis of Assisi and consider him to be an ambassador of grace.Jenny L. Bates, author of ""Opening Doors: An equilog of poetry about Donkeys"""
4,The truth about trading,"When you start educating yourself on the stockmarket, you start a journey to what really happens.There are hundreds of books out there telling you the same thing, but its not what you need to learn.The Wyckoff Method is about price and volume. And what you can interpret from it.This is what you need to know to compile a trading plan that will stand up to all types of markets.From this book I can now compile a trading plan in relation to volume spread analysis.(VSA)In the pursuit of knowing what a market will do tomorrow, The Wyckoff Method points you in the right direction."
5,Interesting Read,"Being new to Wyckoff I have no basis to compare this book to others on the same subject. However I enjoyed the subject matter and found the contents very interesting. Will this make me a successfull trader, I don't think so. I am a great believer in finding your own way to do things after carefull study of other successfull people. This book has given me some ideas to work on which will hopefully give me a better understanding of the price movement of markets. All in all well worth the money I paid."
3,Half a loaf not better than the whole in the market,"This book attempts to summarize the Wyckoff Method for stock and commodities markets activities. These markets are very complex and no abridgment of Wyckoff's voluminous work can begin to do qualify as a substitution. As a summary of Wyckoff I guess it's ok, but then who would want to read it as literature?"
5,Olympus Battery,"Battery arrived quickly, well packaged and works perfectly. Very affordable, great service. Recommend it to anyone in need of one."
5,Best Price for a Replacement Battery,"This was WAY less expensive than an equivelent aftermarket Duracell battery for our work camera. The Duracell is a good battery, but not 3-6 times better, which is what I would of paid for one. The aftermarket batteries for the Olympus Cameras range from lousy, like 15-20 pictures before needing a recharge, to decent, like the 40-50 I was getting from a Duracell. But none beat the original Olympus equipment. We average around 60-70 pictures from an Olympus LI-42B battery for 12 to 18 months of fairly consistant use and recharge cycles. I will be ordering additional batteries from this company and would not hesitate recommending them to others. Shipping was very fast also. Had the battery in hand less than 72 hours after ordering it."
1,D,"This battery was brand new, seemed like original packaging. It however did not work.Returned it, no questions asked, no hassles. Received credit, ordered a different one, the next one did work."
5,Love it,Perfect for my Olympus camera and this battery will give me years of quick and easy picture taking - great price
1,Unhappy - not original,"Please don't order this battery. All the comments about the battery are TRUE. THE BATTERY IS WORTHLESS!!! I ordered in May 2012. The battery will not hold its charge and it is not the original. I should trust all the reviews. I didn't give a star at all, but the website will not accept the comment unless it is at least a star. The battery S_ _ _ _!!!"
2,Product was not chargeable.,"I purchased this battery so I would have an extra battery to use for photos I planned to take on a trip to France. I was never able to charge the battery. I am assuming the product was defective when I purchased it. Needless to say, I am very unhappy with the product."
5,Customer Satisfied,I just bought this replacement battery for my Olympus camera. I works as expected. I fitted the camera perfectly and the battery life is good. Shipping was free and the item was received in just a few days.
1,Good item if only it lasts...,"Got this product some months ago for two Olympus cameras I have. The part number matches and everything starts fine. After only 1 week the first camera stopped working so I bought a new camera and two weeks later the other camera stopped too. I contacted Olympus and they want to charge me arms and legs to fix the problem. Then, by accident I tried one of the old batteries and the surprise! Both cameras are working so the problem was with the batteries... I'm really not willing to claim a warranty replacement but I wish the batteries did last for at least 6 month..."
5,great product,this is an original Olympus battery that's lightweight and affordable. The retailer was very fast and reliable with their service.
3,Li-Ion rechargeable battery,"I bought this battery because the original battery provided only a limited number of pictures.This battery also provides a limited number of pictures about 70-80. I was expecting a lot more.So the battery design is such that you can only get a limited number of pictures. Therefore, I am resigned to keeping a couple of spare ones on hand."
4,Olympus Rechargeable Battery,The battery came in a sealed package in a timely manner. I'm happy with my decision to purchase it through Amazon.com.
5,Olympus rechargeable battery LI-42B,I found this to be a useful second battery and the recharger that came with the Olympus camera recharges very quickly.
4,Good batteries.,"They're good batteries. They lasted as long as the camera lasted, so I consider that a good buy. Definitely recommended."
2,Ok for the price.,"These batteries do have a short life even if you recicle them frequently.,do not leave them without charging for long periods.,since they will die sooner."
1,Batteries (two) were duds.,"After approx . 4 separate uses and charging cycles, each battery only provided enough power to take approx 10 photos (per charging cycle) with an Olympus SW 720 camera. Ordinarily, the Olympus Li-42B battery has enough power to take 150+ pictures each charging. And the Olympus Li-42B ordinarily lasts 2+ years.Each of these batteries had a manufacture date of 06-2012.I returned the batteries and was refunded all but $6.00."
2,Doesn't hold a charge very well,"I got this one to replace a battery that died in my Olympus Camera, but this one NEVER held a great charge either."
2,Not Impressed,"Charged the battery as soon as it arrived, but found it does not hold a charge for very long. Original battery went without charging for months, if lucky this one last 1/2 day."
5,Replacement,"It is to soon to make a reasonable review about this battery but if it performs like the original that came with the camera, it should give me many pictures before another is needed."
5,Camera Battery,I just needed a new (back-up) battery for my Olympus digital camera and this filled the fill perfectly. I am quite satisfied.
5,A Pleasant Surprise,"What at first was a disappointment (I didn't receive my order in time for a trip abroad)turned into a really pleasant surprise and a reminder that some merchants still have old-fashion values with regards to excellent customer service. When the folks at 1 to 3 found out my order was late they quickly apologized (they had me at that point) and insisted on refunding all of the shipping fees, not just the expedited fee.I feel like they truly are interested in my satisfaction, not just a sale. What a pleasure to deal with people like this.Definitely will do business with them again...and again"
1,Has never worked! don't buy it,"I bought this for my uncle. I imagined the battery would be fine, but last time I spoke him, he mentioned the battery never worked.ANother battery like this from another supplier didn't work either (after one charge it has stoppped working).It told my uncle better buy another camera (no more Olympus) instead of investing in lousy batteries.There are supposed to be original Olympus batteries!"
2,hmm doesn't seem to hold a lot,"My first experience with this battery is not the same with the other reviewers, first it has no english in the instructions that came with it. After using it for the first time, the battery didn't hold a charge enough to last a hockey game (approx 3 hours total) and died down at the start of the third period!!! I will continue to use it and see if maybe it was just because of the first time use and hopefully it will improve and hold more charge!!"
1,I am very unhappy....,"I am very unhappy with the service that is being provided... I had recently purchased Item: Olympus LI-42B Li-Ion Rechargeable Battery.....however, it did not work even when it was charged. I returned the item, it was then delivered on 8/2/10 it is now 8/24, i have not been refunded my money back, its been more than 14 days....i have sent ameribargins numerous email updating me, however no one responded....now this has gone on long enough....this is the first time i have ever had this problem with amazon and being treated like this....i would like my money back now...............Olympus LI-42B Li-Ion Rechargeable Battery"
3,Might receive wrong batter,"This says it is a LI-42B and the packaging says it is a LI-42B. The description specifically says it will fit my Stylus 720 camera.BUT the actual package I received had a LI-50B which is 1/2"" too big to fit the camera or charger.(And I had paid extra to get it by Christmas so I could use it... now I have to go out and buy one locally and pay $40.00 for some cheap imitation brand.)"
4,Olympus battery,"The battery is exactly as described & fits the camera. Have not had a need to use it yet though, but know it will fit."
5,Good battery,"Good value for the money, Long battery life,Olympus LI-42B Li-Ion Rechargeable Battery (Retail Packaging)Olympus LI-12B Rechargeable Lithium-Ion Battery for Select Stylus and C Series Digital Cameras"
3,Worked for me!,"I didn't want to buy a new camera because the one I have still looks new. I'm glad I decided to buy a new battery instead, because at first I wasn't sure if the problem was with the camera itself or the battery. This battery's working fine so far although my camera still shuts off unexpectedly once in a while. Great deal!"
4,Camera battery,Good value and it seems to be holding a charge well and of course it was a much better deal than the camera store.
5,Excellent Battery. Don't settle for less.,"This battery is a great way to keep your memories alive. I bought this particular one as a backup for my Stylus 7010.If you're considering this product, don't settle for less. The non-OEM batteries will just cause you grief in the long run.Lithiums are better then Ni-mH and the others. They cost more, but they won't randomly die out on you.I give this product 5 solid stars."
1,Won't keep a charge...,"This battery won't keep a charge.After charging the battery with the Olympus battery charger, my camera can only take 3 pictures before it indicates ""battery empty.""Also, the model on the battery reads 60206BA, but the battery I wanted to buy reads 51209BA."
1,Knock off battery,These batteries that Amazon sells are complete phonies of the orginial manufacture. I purchased 2 batteries for a recent trip and after charging them neither one would hold a charge or even have enough power to take 1 picture. I should have known better when I put the battery in the wall charger and the charging light went out in less tha 10 minutes.
3,doesn't recognize fully charged,"My phone doesn't recognize the batteries as fully charged, until you plug a charger into the phone (it only has to be plugged in until the phone is powered on). Then they work just fine."
4,"Works fine, good price","This product may be counterfeit or factory seconds. The label was misaligned and looked somewhat different from the original battery that we had. Based on photos of the battery, Olympus product support also suspected it to be counterfeit.That said, the battery does hold a charge well and works much better than some other after-market batteries that I have tried. Don't know yet how long this one will last, but so far it works well and was much cheaper than other sources.Delivery was fairly prompt through the US Postal Service."
4,Olympus LI-42B rechargeable battery,The wrong battery was initially sent. A single phone call solved the problem and the correct battery arrived today. A prepaid sticker was provided for use in returning the old battery.
3,Not sure if it's original...,"It looks like an original, it works like an original, but the packaging was a bit suspicious; That also looked original, but it was stapled close! I really don't think that Olympus (or whoever makes their batteries for them) would staple their packages close. For that reason alone, I've given it three stars. Be warned!"
3,So far so good,"The product description noted ""Retail Packaging"", which was not true. The battery was loose in the packing envelope, which understandably made me nervous. So far I have taken several hundred pictures with one charge, which is much better than my old battery. So, so far so good. If it had actually been in retail packaging, I would have given it 5 stars."
4,Looks like the original,Time will tell how well it hold a charge. I gave it 4 stars due to other reviews being less that great.
5,Camera battery,I was unable to purchase this battery in the stores. They were out of the item or did not carry it. Your price was very reasonable.
3,"OK, hope they hold up","These were advertised as in ""retail packaging"". Last time I checked, the retail stores didn't have them in clear, unmarked plastic baggies. We got the before Christmas, and they seemed to do well after their initial charge.They definitely matched the OEM battery that came with the camera, and were certainly better than a previous aftermarket battery we bought a few years back. Time will tell if they are truly worthy, but so far, so good.The seller should revise their description, however, as we almost decided to instantly reurn them due to the packaging not being as described."
1,Fairly dead battery,"The battery was in retail packaging, but it must have been there for quite a while, because there wasn't much charge left in it. I only took about 20 pictures before it died. I recharged it and the same thing happened."
3,Retail Packaging must mean Used,"Purchased this replacement battery for my Olympus camera. The battery works just fine, and holds a charge just as you'd expect. My issue is that the battery itself is dented and marked up. A very poor looking exterior. I wasn't aware I was buying a Used battery. In the future make sure to note that Retail Packaging may mean Used."
1,Olympus LI-42B Battery,"Battery looks fine but why did it show up as being compatible to my Stylus800 camera? The cables I bought in the same search screen did fit my camera, Amazon needs some work. This is not compatible to my camera which is why I may never buy something like this again on the web, be cause you can not see and touch it. To ship it back will cost more than the battery so ""GOT YA, GOT YA"""
1,electronics accessories,"Item was delivery on time in original package has stated. Item seems to be defective, it charge it to full and when place in camera, camera indicate that battery needs to be recharge. This product is no good would not recommend for other to purchase."
5,Excellent Price and Product,"I am very happy with this purchase, the price was excellent, the product arrived very quickly, and it is working very well in my Olympus camera."
4,olympus camera battery,"we had 2 year old olympus camera which ran out of battery, so i found these as radio shack did not carry the battery, sold by amazon and arrived on time at decent price."
5,great battery,My old battery wasn't holding a charge anymore..bought this one and charged it up..working great! It also shipped very quickly.
5,Just What I Expected,"I am very satisfied with my battery. My camera's former battery had never been in very good condition prior to me finding it on skiing slopes. My camera is back up and running. It was a quick delivery so I had it in time for my three week camping trip, and I only needed to charge it once with mild use over my trip. Very helpful via email when I was concerned about their return policy. Good company."
4,Olympus Camera Battery,Just like the one that came with the camera. Was not happy with the LI-40 battery. Hope this one lasts longer than the original equipment. Nicely priced.
5,Works Great!,I bought these batteries for my and my mom's Olympus cameras. It's an extra battery to have on had for both of us. Works great. Holds charge well. Very helpful on our vacation to swap out the battery when one dies.
5,Works perfect!,"I bought this for my Olympus Stylus camera and it works great! the price for this battery was a great deal! When my battery dies out, Im gonna purchase from seller again!!"
1,Bait $ Switch,Hmmmm.... ordered the Olympus LI-42B Lithium Ion Rechargeable Battery for ca. $6 from Amazon...the price was $5 more when billedOlympus LI-42B Li-Ion Rechargeable Batteryon Amazon. Is that Amazon's new way of 'balancing sales'?
5,"Wow, very suprised","I am a truly hardcore spider man fan, I really realy enjoy anything spiderman, from action figures to video games. I didn't want to spend alot of money on a console version of this game so I tried this one out. This game truly amazed me, Although its a side scroller, it doesn't play like one at all, and web slinging through levels, (even side scrolling!!) is fun. The combat system is unfourtunatley dull, (for spidey) he has a few moves and combos, but its very repetitive after playing 2-3 levels with him. This changes with venom, you use the touch screen for him, for all sorts of moves. The game also introduces a choose this or that, but your going to do it eventually missions system. You basically choose which mission you want to do, (either spidey's or venoms) then play them. Overall this game was fun to play, had an ok storyline, and gets a 5 * average for me."
4,Ultimate Spider-Man DS Game,"Overall, I am pleased with the service provided by the Book Grove. I ordered the game for my grandson for Christmas; however, the game did not work in his DS. The metal part of the game was damaged. I contacted Amazon who put me in touch with the Book Grove. They suggested that we try the game in another machine. It was taken to a GameStop and we were told that the game was damaged. The people at Book Grove asked that the game be returned within 7 days. Without an address that was pretty much impossible. I later received an e-mail from the Book Grove which stated that arrangements had been made to send out a replacement. I received a used game rather than a new game which I had paid for. I received the replacement on Saturday of this past week. My grandson was very excited to get the game which works fine in his DS."
2,Better suited for a child...,"Although a reasonable introduction to the paleontology of Indiana, this work is written well below the reading level of all but the most patent novices in paleontology. Buy this for your 12-year-old, but find something better for yourself."
1,"poorly written, has a lot of mistakes and typos","Looks like the initial intent was to cover a lot of topics, but the quality of presentation is quite poor. I is a pain to read this book due to a numerous typos, mistakes in solutions (the first example, 3.2.1.b gives wrong solution, any weather radar technitial understands that the Doppler frequency must be doubled). Author seems to be a good administrator but not a good writer. Also several wrong reference citings has been found. Self boasting, however, is felt from the very beginning."
4,"Good coverage, but narrow focus","In-depth coverage of modulation scheme, but somewhat limited. Good book for those keen on learning one of the proprietary modulation schemes out there."
1,The Essential Jesus - Not up to Crossan's usual standards,"While Crossan's book might make for a nice gift for someone who likes books full of sound bytes, it does not contain the detailed scholarship of his earlier works. I purchased the book as an addition to our church library and was disappointed to see that most of the pages contained only a sentence or two or a virtually indistinguishable photo of early Christian art. I'm sure that Crossan and his publisher believe that this book is a worthwhile investment, but I think that he should have waited to publish until he had something to actually put in a book."
1,Nothing lower than 1 star,"For a book written by supposed historians, there is an amazing absense of historical evidence to back up what they write. Mostly ""evidence? who needs evidence, just believe in us we're scholars so we must know what we're talking about"". When they actually produce some evidence that their version of things is more accurate than what's in the Bible, then I may start listening to them. Until then, stear clear of this book or for that matter any of their books and the supposed ""Jesus Seminar"". All of the above are purely thier opinions without one shred of evidence, but they always present them as fact."
4,Study in preconceptions,"John Dominic Crossan is an excellent scholar whose works are always worth reading - and this book is no exception. However, one is never sure reading this work whether Crossan's view of Jesus as an economic / social rebel shapes his view of the essential Jesus or vice versa. Either way the book is worth reading for both what it tells one about Jesus and what it tells on about Crossan."
1,DONT BUY THIS FROM STACKS & STACKS,"I ordered this a week ago, they still have not shipped it......I get no response from seller STACKS and STACKS when I inquired twice as to when it will ship.Don't make the same mistake I did unless you can wait and wait and wait for it to ship, if it is actually even in stock!!!"
2,ok but..................,"Smaller than I realized. I also purchased an ""Uncle Mike's"" car organizer. If you are looking for a larger more roomy organizer go with the Uncle Mike's."
5,Awesome!,"I love this car organizer, so I glad I spent a few more bucks for this one. I'm an itinerant teacher so I spend a lot of time in my car and this is perfect for finding anything from an umbrella, Tylenol, or a nail file. You can fit so much, and it's great being able to just swing it to the back when I have a passenger ."
3,Helpful,smaller than I thought but works nice. great if you travel for work and need a place to keep items.
5,I love this!,"I keep snack, notepad and pen, gloves, water bottle, all at my fingertips. And I can quickly flip it to hang on the back side of the seat if someone rides with me. Its great not having to gather up all the stuff that would typically be covering the passenger seat."
3,I wish this had a true cupholder on the side,"I bought this as a gift for my nephew who just got his first car. Before I give it to him, I'll put these things in it:1-tire gauge2-antibacterial wipes3-notepad and several pens4-map of his city5-small first aid kit6-box of propel powder packet7-address book with phone numbers (in case he looses his cell phone or leaves it at home - most of us no longer memorize phone numbers)I looked at A LOT of car organizers before choosing this one. I like the fact that it doesn't take up seat space and hangs in the front where it's easy for the driver to access it. Plus it can be swung around behind the seat if you have a passenger.I had it shipped to me, and when I opened it was a bit disappointed that the place for a bottle (see the photo) is a mesh pocket - it wouldn't be easy to just drop a bottle or lidded cup into it. Otherwise I would have given it 5 stars."
5,Perfect for a kid travel organizer!,"I needed a way to occupy my kids on a long car trip, so I purchased 2 of these organizers and filled them with crayons, markers, colored pencils, travel games, a clipboard (that they could decorate with stickers) with notepaper ... the sky is the limit! You could put snacks and drinks too. It worked perfectly! They were so excited for the sun to come up so they could get started using all their stuff. It clips and unclips easily to the seat with a sturdy clip and is also easy to tighten/loosen. It holds LOTS of stuff without ever falling out."
5,Works just as described,This organizer is an efficient way of utilizing the space in an unoccupied passenger seat. Everything is kept at a level that is convenient to reach for the driver while driving. What I love about the organizer is that you can swing it away when the passenger seat is needed. The pockets are well spaced and the seams seem rugged enough that they will stand up to long term use. I recommend it to anyone who wants a place to stash all the miscellaneous in their car.
2,"Nice organizer, not very durable","Based on the positive reviews, I had hoped this was going to really solve our messy car problem and help us to keep important things handy during road trips. I do like the overall size of this organizer and the different pockets but it just hasn't held up well for this family of four. Within a couple of months the fabric at the top started to rip, exposing the cardboard backing. It's still functional but really can't hold much weight (water bottles or children's picture books) without stressing the seams. Might be ok for a young single person but not for a family with lots of stuff."
5,Helped on my long trip,"I had to drive cross country so purchased items I thought would help. This High Road SwingAway Driver Organizer did just that. I put my maps, glasses, books, and water in it, and felt easier to drive knowing I could reach them with ease. I get distracted all too easy, and worry about being a safe driver. This product allieviated those fears greatly."
3,"OK, but too SMALL","OK, if you don't have much or want a TINY holder, but not enough for what I needed in my patrol car. It truly is just too small for what I needed and I think for the ""average"" person also. Maybe if you have just a few things and are retired, it would be good for that type of person. Seems to be constructed ok, not tough, but ok I would say."
4,Perfect for People who drive primarily alone or with backseat toddlers :),I bought this to try to contain the plethora of toddler necessities I travel with. It is also great for a few water bottles and my mail. It's really cut down on the number of break slides (this is my word for what happens when you break and all the crap on your front seat flies down into the foot area) I experience in a day.
5,Better than the last one!,"Though heart To yours was a pleasant surprise for me, Michelle's sophomore album really shows her increased confidence as a solo artist. in my opinion, her unique and beautiful voice shines more brightly here than on her debut, and the style of the music is much more original. This disc is a pleasant mix of funky, upbeat numbers like Purpose In Your Storm, jazzy mid-tempos like Never be The Same, and emotional ballads like Fifteen Minutes and the title track. The lyrics seem to come from her heart, which also shows in the way she sings. This is definitely something to check out even if, like me, you're not a huge fan of gospel music. This is because Michelle tries to please mainstream fans too, and succeeds magnificently!"
5,That's my girl!!,I love this CD.. I also have the first one.. they both are excellent and I am extremely proud of her... I agree with most of the reviewers in that she did not get hardly enough shine when she was with DC.. now that she has branched off and started doin her own thing it is my personal belief that she will eventually out shine the other 2/3 of DC.. Im looking forward to upcoming projects from Michelle.. she is definitely the truth
2,Don't straddle the fence.,"I think this album is okay. The first was better. Maybe I am having a hard time accepting the album because Michelle is back with Destiny's Child with more risque lyrics than before. I am a Christian and by NO means am I near perfect but my ""fence straddling"" is not publicized either."
3,Good.....But.....,"The CD is good. Still waiting on her to hit the songs with some Anointing, but I guess that will come once she stops compromising. I belive she should remain solo and leave Destiny's Child and committ fully to the Lord & Gospel Music. We are supposed to be the light of the world! We must remember that we are IN THE WORLD, BUT NOT OF THE WORLD!"
1,Ew,"She's the friggin psycho-religious hands-together-halo-over-her-head nun girl in her solo stuff, but now she's slithering around like a dimestore skank with DC? Make up your mind, girl!! Only sell out to one group at a time!!! It would be nice to see the real Michelle, not her pop culture image. Although her horrible Macy Gray-like voice lessens that desire from time to time. I think this album is putting me to sleeeeeeee.....zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz"
1,Michelle who?,"I've never heard such a bad album in a long time.Sometimes I wonder, what makes people think of singing? Michelle has zero talent when it comes to singing, her voice is ugly, weak, and so boring. I cannot think of a single postive element in her, she is not beautiful, she is not sexy, there is just nothing special about her.The first album was a disaster, and this one is even worse, please don't make another solo album, please."
3,"Not bad, not bad","Beyonce stripped down, sold her golden voice and overwhelming sexuality, and hit it huge. Her former Destiny's Child sister, Michelle Williams, has taken here golden voice, and used it as an outlet to praise Jesus. This album will surely delight the gospel world, with an up-to-date version of R&B church music you can get jiggy to. It is a subtle praise, and seems more like an undercover gospel album dressed in R&B garb. The Last track features Beyonce and Kelly Rowles come together on the final track, which is the crowning jewel of the album. Michelle has gone with what shes feels, and you can't knock her for that. Who says you have to sell your soul to make it big?"
4,DO YOU KNOW this CD is much stronger than her first!,"MICHELLE WILLIAMS returns with a second solo project. I was truly anticipating something as weak and disappointing as her first solo effort. To my surprise, this is not the case with this CD. On DO YOU KNOW, MICHELLE completes a 360 turnaround and delivers to the public a product that is strong, bright, catchy and unique. The tracks on this CD are perfectly produced to reveal sweet vocals that are highlighted to stand out. Her vocals manage to evoke a mild harmonious blend reminiscent of the musical style of a youngish Holiday. I guess MICHELLE paid attention to the negative reviews of her previous effort and concentrated to produce a product that could stand the test of time. I can honestly say, this CD is worth purchasing. The tracks on this release are catchy making you forget all the flubs of her first release."
4,"East Village ""High Fidelity""","This is a ""guy"" relationship book. Martin Sierra, an unpublished poet who idolizes Bukowski, can't catch a break. Nearing the age of 30, he's still desperately clinging to his dream of being a writer, though all he has to show for his efforts, so far, is a mountain of rejection letters. Unlike a Bukowski character, however, Martin is the sensitive, shy type; so along with his lack of literary success, his dead end ""non-career,"" he can't find a date. His best and maybe only friend is a woman who takes on the big sister role, advising him as he tries to negotiate the surreal world of personal ads and the downtown singles scene.The format reminded me a little of Fante's ""Ask The Dust."" Short chapters, lively characters, and a willful main character made this an entertaining read. Parts reminded me of ""High Fidelity,"" and ""Sex Lies and videotape."" I enjoyed this fun book."
2,Annoyingly Redundant,"Though I found this book full of facts and a great look into their lives, the Author is very repetitive in his writing. He repeats himself to the point of annoyance. There are paragraphs that are rewritten two to three times in a few chapters. If you can get past this, check it out. If it irritates you like it does me, find another title about them!"
1,Keytronic Cordless Keyboard and mouse. Dont buy!,"The mouse didnt work at all. The keyboard didnt work well. Letters stuck, and sometimes wouldnt work at all.Also this is only compatable for a PC, NOT LAP TOP. I found that out the hard way and tried to return. They wouldn't take back so I had to buy an adapter and it still wasn't worth the money. I threw it away."
3,A One view movie,"This was a good movie with excellent acting, but the topic was one that is very disturbing and difficult to view once, let alone more than that."
1,Just plain terrible movie,"This movie is just terrible. I had read lots of reviews bashing this picture, but as a true X-files fan I had to buy it. I thought to myself, I had bought ""The House of D"" just because of David, so this couldn't be worse than that. I was wrong.There's no character development. All of a sudden the characters are at a party, and before the 10 min mark you are already confused and bored. The director/writer has just no clue about what movie making is about. It's pure and gratuitous nudity, violence and stupid and totally unrealistic situations.If you are a fan of Gillian and you must buy this, at least try to get it on a sale, because frankly this movie isn't worthed the film in which was printed on..."
1,Who cares?,"The movie was bad. But who cares? Gillian Anderson + Full Frontal Nudity = Happy, Happy Lesbian. :-)Nuf said."
3,Closure,"A bit of a thriller, but a little too graphic in some spots for me. It held my attention though."
4,Closure,Well directed. Well acted. Violent scenes shot well by giving you the visual without actually showing you the visual. Enjoyed watching Gillian Anderson in different role and her British accent.
2,Gillian Anderson,Not a particularly good movie. I bought it because I like Gillian Anderson and wanted to see her in something other than X Files. Not an Academy Award winning performance.
3,Dark and dreary,"This film about a brutal rape and beating a couple endured and the revenge they take take on the group responsible.While this plot offers some great opportunities, the film avoids them.The actors dont seem to have much emotion as they go on the hunt other than Anderson's ability to scowl and look disturbed. The process of finding and taking revenge was predictable from the start as the story unfolded. About the only saving grace to the film was Anderson's abilityto bare more than her soul. Much of the drearyness of the film is probably due to the shooting location. They should have shot it in the Bahamas."
5,had to get another cd,"I really love this album! I bought it on cdbaby a few months ago but came here to get another as a gift. I found out about Gina through a friend on myspace and have been hooked ever since. Her voice is pure and filled with emotion. The whole album has a great ""coffee shop"" feel to it. My favorite songs are (Move Me) & (Here & There). The album is perfect for background music when you have guests and great for those introspective long car rides where you daydream about past relationships. I can't wait for her next album!"
3,balls and my word,"this is tight the first version of the geto boys before scarface, willie d, and bushwick bill came up on the mics but at this time bushwick was a dancer and the geto boys consisted of prince johnny c, jukebox, and dj ready red these mugs sound like run dmc wannabe's my favorite joint is balls and my word which samples the movie classic scarface a movie many rappers sampled over the years."
5,ON a scale from illy to fresh i give this a dope!,Yo dj ready red rips it up on the wheels of steel then bushwick be like yo money yo dis is ill yall betta pick this one up cause its john blaze itll make you wanna smack that bottom like a god darn car crash dj ready red is definetly the illest he be like just like that ceedric and big willie d be like yea just lilke that
4,Goes nicely with sugar bowl,I purchased this pitcher because I was purchasing the sugar bowl and spoon and decided to complete the set. It is nicely designed and attractive.
5,"Perfect, Classy Cream Pitcher","Exactly what I was looking for to serve after dinner coffee or put out in a breakfast spread. I also got the matching sugar dish with the cute little spoon. Very high quality feel and I just wish they made a tray I could put the two together on. In fact, these would make a great hostess gift :)Some mentioned how small they are, but I think they are the perfect size."
2,So So,Do not buy a mask online unless you have tried the model on your face. Also I have found that the sniff test does not necessarily ensure a water seal so I would never buy another mask without first wearing it in water.The snorkel sucks. It is supposed to prevent water from getting in but none of these gadgets really work and I think you are better off anticipating it being filled with water then the other way around.
1,Durability Concerns,"I received the unit intact but before first use, the goggles broke by means of a peice of plastic attaching the strap to the mask. Thus, I did not even get a chance to use the goggles so they may in fact work nicely provided you carry them everywhere in a pillow.The snorkel is extremely heavy and the unit which I had problems with the valve at the top which prevents water from entering. The valve stuck way too much, even after lubricating, causing a reverse affect where you could not breathe even when you didn't have water in the tube. The weight also causes it not to stay upright if using other goggles.I'd recommend sticking to the Seabreeze and Cozumel set, from my experience at least."
1,"GOOD BRAND, POOR DESIGN, SNORKEL USELESS","I had the same problems as as other reviewer. The valve on the snorkel closes when you don't need it and in turn, cuts off your ability to breathe air. I also found it to be heavy and feel it should be held in place by the mask."
4,For Mac User,"i don't know why ppl said they are unable to make print from their mac, i am personal using a TiBook 400 with 10.3.4, i download and install the driver from Samsung Website, then i hook up the printer with USB cord and everything works perfectly fine with me, and i recently hook it up with my Airport Express, and i use Rendezvous printing and share it with my other Wintel machines at home, never have a problem.my experience tell me that you need good paper to get quality print from this little machine(never try grahpic, i print text only)."
2,Horrible single sheet feed - not for check printing.,"I bought this to replace a 10 year old HP Laserjet 4L primarily used for printing checks from Quicken. The HP was flawless, this is another story. Printing a full sheet of checks from the paper cassette is fine, but anything requiring the manual sheet feed is a disaster. The mechanism used to sense paper in the slot is touchy. It sometimes works and mostly doesn't. I've wasted more money in spoiled checks than I paid for the printer itself."
2,Text quality looks like 300 DPI only,"Pro: Cheap and smallCon:1. come with 25% toner only, after you print out around 200 pages, you need to buy a new toner, which is almost same price of this printer. refill toner if you can, buy toner refill kit from ebay, only cost you $10.2. noise level is hight when printing.3. 1200 DPI text quality looks like 300 DPI. HP has the best text quality.After I dump this print, I purchase a brother 14XX laster, same price, 100% toner, better print out quality, but a little bit bigger in footprint."
5,Toner Costs Not Bad Compared to Brother 1440,I had to respond to some of those that are complaining about the replacement cartidge cost of about $80 for this printer. They are saying that their Brother toner cartidge only cost $50 in comparison. We'll that is only for the toner! Brother charges you an extra $100 for the drum. The Samsung cartrige comes with the toner and the drum for only $80. You do the math.
2,Good while it lasts,"This is a great little printer, while it lasts. I've owned both the ML1740 and the earlier ML1710 and both failed shortly after the one year manufacturer warranty expired. If you want a printer for a year, this one is great - otherwise, I would put your dollars somewhere else.The errors that each one had were different, incidentally."
1,NOT supported on a Mac!!,"I bought this printer to work with my MacOS X machine. I opened the box to find a little note -- Samsung Specification Revision Bulletin #001-032904 -- stating that this printer is not fully compatible with Mac operating systems. Additionally, ""Any references to Mac compatibility in any advertising, manuals, specifications, or other documentation is not valid and should be disregarded.""That's nice since I bought the thing online based on specifications and reviews stating that it WAS Mac-compatible.To their credit, they say that they'll accept the return of, and issue a full refund for the printer. We'll see how that goes tomorrow.Be warned that the following Samsung printers/multifunction devices also fall under this bulletin:ML-1740 printerML-1750 printerCLP-500 printerCLP-500N printerSCX-4016 multifunction productSCX-4216F multifunction product"
4,Great step up from InkJet,"I bought this printer about 2 months ago to replace a dead canon i850 and have been extremely happy. Initially I had a standard parallel cable connecting it to my computer and the first page out time was roughly 8 seconds. When I found a spare USB cable in my closet, first page out went down to almost 5 seconds and general print speed increased.It's fast and spits out great quality prints. I've compared it to the output of a much more expensive HP Laserjet 8000 and it is as good or better.The only downside is that I'd like to do duplex printing, but then again I don't know of a laser in this price range (sub $200) that can.I figured my long term ownership costs (paper and toner) to come in around 2.7 cents a page compared to an inkjet with per page costs somewhere around 9 to 20 cents each. Also, it has a published life cycle of around 60,000 pages before needing a tune up."
1,[....]poor product.,"We purchased this printer to take the load off an ink jet and lower printing costs. A brick and mortar store had this printer on sale and advertised [...]We decided to keep the printer and eat the lesser of the two rebates--it was still a good deal. I hooked it up and found marks on the margin caused by a defective toner cartridge. Samsung's solution is for me to buy a new cartridge. Also the printing is twisted on the page Samsung says the paper doesn't meet its' spec. Two different laser papers from two different manufacturers that comply with the spec printed in the owners manual and they blame the paper.Look at another manufacturer for your laser needs, we are."
4,Good buy,"Glad i made the switch from ink to lazer.....dont have to waste time and money to get ink and this does everything i need it to do....i do not need coloUr printouts and so this is perefct. Some people complain it take too long to get ready but i dont see that, seems to get up and ready pretty fast. Small size is also a great help"
3,ya get what ya paid for,"This printer is perhaps the most unreliable printer I've used! It intermittently print error messages with no rhyme nor reason which costs my money. I really wanted to use this laser printer to print prepaid mailing labels so that they won't smear if they get wet. I only get 2 tries to print the label correctly and if the printer doesn't cooperate, which was quite often, I have to send a claim in, which is very inconvenient, not to mention wasting label material."
4,This It can be shared,"Just to make sure you people get the wrong idea from other reviewers. As per the manual, you just need a host pc to connect the printer to, then you can share it thru that pc."
4,"clear illustrations, directions and descriptions","I loved this book when I used it for class, and kept it for reference afterwards. I really liked how direct and clear the infomation was, I felt that if the need arose, I would be able to appropriately execute a new restraint, etc based on this book. It has a good deal of very relevant information, especially for someone who might not be as familiar with handling a species, for instance a cow person who needs to help someone with their swine. And for someone who might not have been around livestock, there is a lot to learn as well with plenty of illustrations so even if you are still learning the terminology you can see what is being described."
3,"Good for beginners, too basic for more advanced people","I got this book for a livestock management class, glanced through it, and never looked at it again. It goes through how to handle all sorts of different animals, which is great for beginners, but way too basic if you've already worked with them. I wouldn't waste your money on it unless you are an absolute beginner in the animal science world."
3,Help!,"Like most Microsoft Publications, this book is totally impossible to penetrate for the beginner, or the intermediate beginner. It is twisted and illogical, jumping from one exception to the next. I don't blame the author for the chaos, blame Microsoft.I think in a few weeks or months I may understand what a Property really is and how I can use it.Looks like preaching to the converted to me. At least it trys to be funny. Like being funny in a torture chamber."
2,First Edition was not very useful,"The book attempts to give a presentation of the requirements needed to write an ActiveX control, but the flow of the text jumps all over the place, skipping topics and glossing over the important ones, such as simple containment. Hopefully the second edition will remedy this."
2,Worst of my Leon Russell CDs,"This is by far the worst of the CDs I have of L.R. Get Shelter People, Live, or Carney first they are much better. This CD lacks any real feeling or enthusiasm on Leon's part. He just doesn't sound like he's really into his music on the album. To me he is just cranking out some songs to make some bucks. Bought this CD used and wasn't even worth the price I paid. Pass on this one for sure."
5,AWESOME!,"MCSolaar is awesome and by far the BEST French Africain rap/hip-hop artist. He really is a true artist and knows how to best mix vocal with instrumental. His use of rhyme in lyrics is awesome and most of the time poetic but I think there is a bit too much emphasis in making rhymes. There is a hit of jazz which gives a good melody. There hasn't been an McSolaar CD that I didn't like and wouldn't play over and over again. He blows away all other French artists in the same category. I particularly like the underlying message of his lyrics. He obviously has a social conscience. This is not gangsta rap which is quite refreshing from the violent, pro-drug, anti-cop crap churned out by American so-called artists."
2,Below Their Standards,"While both Domingo and Fleming are among today's outstanding singers, this is a very dissappointing disc. Even in the Othello selection, which comes from their normal operatic repetoire, they are not engaging. The dramatic tension is suprisingly slack. Unless you need to have every disk they made, pass this one up."
2,Terrible,"I must say that this album was not what I had hoped, and as it was my introduction to Renee Fleming, it was sometime before I bought another of her CDs. Domingo, I would hope, would have better judgement in his recordings, for I found this album nowhere near standard.Please only purchase this item if you have enjoyed better works from both artists, for it was my introdution to them both, and I regret to say that I was most dissapointed! ~"
2,"Great for the first 2 months, then...","I love the design of this headset. If the cord only lasted longer than it did, this would be a 5-star item. After 2 months, the cord shorts out and if I tilt my head just right while I am talking, the wires will have enough connection that people can hear me. Very frustrating. I hope others have had a better experience."
4,Great inexpensive headset,"I've used this headset for nearly a year without problems, finding the voice transmission superior to others in a similar price range"
4,A Nifty Little Pendant Necklace,I bought this necklace as a gift and was worried it may look like cheap costume jewelry. I was happily surprised when it arrived. You won't mistake it for something from Tiffany's bought it is a nice piece of antique styled jewelry. The locket sealed well and holds the photo of your choice. If you're looking for that little something for mommy or granny give this one a look.
3,Not too bad for a casebook,"The structure could be better, but I do like how the book explains the rationales and policies in the notes between cases; it makes the cases themselves much more cognizable if you read the notes after the cases first."
1,"Poorly organized, out of date, long winded","The book is poorly organized, out of date, and long winded. If you are a professor, look elsewhere. If you are a student who has to use this, try for used -- that way you won't feel so bad when you throw it away."
3,Gotta buy a supplement to get through BA using this text.,I strongly suggest that purchasing a supplement is a wise choice if your prof uses this text for BA - I used the Nutshell by Hamilton (the same author of the text) - Very Helpful! Good luck in BA!
1,Law student perspective :-(,"I'm sure this is a handy reference for people who know about corporations already. However, learning the law of corporations from this text is agonizing. There is no flow to the text; extracts are unhelpfully arranged without explanation.Concepts are often given introductory explanation after you have already trudged through pages in which give the concept more in depth treatment. Inexplicably, much of the best information is in the footnotes.If this is your required text, be prepared to do a lot of additional research to illuminate the content."
1,... better get a good commercial outline,"this book is maddening. it zigzags through material in an incomprehensible fashion. you have to work so hard to see which cases go together and how they go together. it certainly doesn't make it easy.Hamilton has a Nutshell outline, which is okay. The Casenote Outline is quite good in my opinion."
4,Not bad,"I am overall pleased with the purchase because of the deal I got on the book. I shouldn't even complain so I won't. All I will say is there was a little more highlighting and marking than I expected, but some of it is actually helpful so I guess that's a good thing. I would buy from this person again"
1,"If I could rate this lower, I would","I've used Naturade soy replacement formulas before and loved them but the french vanilla was by far the worst. The consistancy was very think, almost like yogurt and it smelled awful. I was unable to drink it. The expiration date on the bottom says 10/2014 but in September of 2012 it was as if it had already expired. I recommend the vanille naturade soy replacement."
4,Does the trick.,"I was looking for something that was quick, full of protein, and would hold my appetite from breakfast until lunch. This does the trick. It mixes better with milk, but I usually use soy milk instead, which the powder stays a bit clumpy in. The taste is not amazing, but what do you expect from a protein powder? I have tasted MUCH worse, and I do not mind the taste at all. Keep in mind, I am not ""savoring"" my breakfast, just gulping it down fast. What I am most impressed by is that it holds my appetite over until lunch. I drink it at about 7:00 AM, and I do not get hungry before 12:00 PM, which makes it a success for me!"
2,Delivery time within timeframe promised ..not so good quality,Was not pleased with Jersey as would have preferred one with Steeler logo & back of one of the Bettis Jerseys had a piece of material behind the silk screening but was not worth hassle of returning.
4,a way to pass the time,"I hadn't read the previous book, Mrs. Pollifax Pursued, where she apparently meets Kadi and Sammy, her main cohorts in this story. Kadi finds out that Sammy is having difficulties and so she and Mrs. Pollifax hop on the first available flight to Ubandiba, where Sammy is the current ruler. The people are terrified by the rumors and murders of the Lion Killer, all of which point to Sammy. Kadi, daughter of murdered Ubandiba missionaries, becomes a target of the Lion Killer and Mrs. Pollifax must use her resources and ingenuity to save them all. I listened to this book, and it was a pleasant diversion on a long drive."
4,More adventure for Mrs. P.,"Gilman's charming spy is back, this time in a book that is more of a sequel than another series entry. Even if you don't normally read series books in order like I do, I strongly suggest you meet Kadi and friends in MRS POLLIFAX PURSUED before reading this one. Now our beloved Emily Pollifax is traveling to Kadi's home turf, Ubangiba, to untangle a web of political intrigue with her usual clever style.There was a noticeable lack of CIA presence in this book that made me wonder if Emily had made a copmlete break from the agency, but then I noticed INNOCENT TOURIST and UNVEILED both come after this one and seem to involve the CIA again. I found the clues a little easier to spot in this book than in earlier stories, but it was great fun putting them together for a satisfying conclusion. All in all, another great Mrs. Pollifax adventure."
3,disappointing,"I never got fully engrossed in this book. The characters were hard to understand, and the whole reason why Mrs Pollifax felt compelled to go to Africa didn't quite make sense. I expected more intrigue associated with the economic development of the mythical African country, but it never happened. And to top things off, when the killer was finally unmasked (literally!) I found it kind of hard to believe it was this character. The whole kidnapping part of the story was weak too. Sorry - just didn't work for me."
5,Buy it,They are an adventure you will truly enjoy taking. I never stop reading them over and over. You cannot go wrong.
4,social work with groups,"delivery came ""on time""... but i waited till last day...book was in good shape."
5,A good suspensful book with well researhed Hawaiin history,"The ancient Hawaiian culture has always held an air of mystique. The language, not readily understandable by the rest of the world, even has a touch of the unknown. Couple these with a warm tropical paradise and you have the perfect setting for suspense.When Kate McKenna, the daughter of a native Hawaiian mother, visits the island of Maui in search of her heritage, a chance meeting with a mysterious stranger piques her curiosity. The stranger, Dan Kala, is disconcerted with the near-identical resemblance of Kate to a long-dead Princess of Hawaiian Royalty.Beginning with a missing roll of film, unexplainable events begin to occur which seem to have roots in a curse out of the past. When Kate begins to doubt her own sanity she wonders if Dan holds the answers, or is he on a search for his own reasons? TAKE MY BREATH AWAY is a good, suspenseful read that kept me turning the pages."
3,Only for fans of Hawaian ghost stories.,"Unless you are already interested in Hawaian history and mythology, this book is likely to be somewhat disappointing. The relationships did not really make sense, and the hero is boring, with incomprehensible motivation. As for the supernatural part, it did not really integrate with the rest of the plot in my view"
3,"Not bad, but not great","I ordered this table at what, at the time, I thought was a steal for $39.99 w/FREE shipping It is advertised as ""sturdy wood construction"".When it arrived I learned that it wasn't very sturdy at all and the table top and seats are pressed cardboard & not wood at all.I actually had to wood glue one of the side pieces together and am considering glueing all of the joints to makes it a bit more sturdy.I bought it because I was looking for an inexpensive outdoor table, but there is no way that pressed cardboard will hold up in the rain. As an indoor table it is decent but there are already dents and dings in the table top from my children."
1,This table = an ER visit for us!!!,"We purchased this table for $14.99 FULLY reading the other reviews so our hopes were not extremely high. BUT I figured for the price and a little help from a little wood glue we would be able to use the table for awhile! NOT EVEN!! We assembled the table and the next morning my 22 pound 2 year old sat on one of the seats and it collapsed right under him. While he was falling to the ground (which isn't a very far fall...its pretty low to the ground, that wasn't the issue) a VERY sharp wood screw protruded out and gouged a three inch gash out of his tiny little leg. We cleaned it up and came to the conclusion it was deep enough for a visit to the ER. Now the table is sitting completely broken out on our deck, just waiting for the recycling truck. My issue is not the money paid...its the safety of this table. It needs to be taken off Amazon and Becks Internation needs to upgrade their quiality control. SO DISAPPOINTED!"
3,DAMAGED!!!,"I ordered this table and was so excited about it because it was exactly what I needed. However it arrived badly damaged and I had to return it and wait for a new one, only to have that one arrive damaged as well, both due to poor packaging. I didn't have the patience to deal with sending it back and waiting again so I just decided to ""deal with it"" the way it was, but I am very upset that I can't have somthing in new condition that I purchased NEW."
1,Childrens wooden table with four seats,"This table came damaged due to poor packaging. The directions were shredded, there was NO hardware at ALL, and there was an obscure board added to the shipment that did not belong. The white material is a pressed cardboard with white veneer type covering, that is cheap and like I said was damaged in many places. DON'T buy this unless you want to be extremely dissapointed."
2,Very cheaply made and will not last long,"I got this table in hopes that I wouldn't have to get one of the $100 little tables for the kids, but this thing just doesn't cut it. You have to be extremely careful when you move it or you'll pop the seat right off and then you have to drill another hole to get it to stay. I think that I over paid for this and I only paid $15. We put it out on the patio and it didn't take long for it to be completely destroyed. It has since been used for firewood. I would only buy this if you are looking for a disposable table."
1,Piece of Junk and NOT SAFE,"This table is a piece of junk. It is poorly constructed. There was damage to the table top. The construction is absolute junk. The construction is so poor, I would not feel safe letting my child use this. Some of the wood pieces were separating at the joints. The mounts in the table top were loose, and I could pull them out by hand. I can't believe an item of such poor quality is sold for children. This is a lawsuit waiting to happen."
3,You get what you pay for,"This is a pretty cheaply-made table. You can't pick it up by the table top because it will come off. I got it for a steal, though, so I'm willing to put up with it."
3,Damadged like everybody elses,Mine came damadged too. It was an easy fix with some wood glue and it looks great but still...I am still very happy with it for hte price I got it at (under $15)
2,"Great Idea, Poor Quality","The table top and seats are made of standard kids toy furniture quality, however, the legs were made out of cheap wood that is unfinished, rough, and splintery. One piece even had had wood putty (very noticeable) smeared about six inches long on side. This wouldn't be a bad buy if the table was marked as ""ready to sand and paint"" but it isn't. I considered keeping the table and fixing it, but as I began to put it together I realized that it is glued with small dowels in most places and the hardware provided wouldn't be enough to withstand a child getting on and off the seat for very long. Also, the box arrived looking fine, but once opened it revealed that it was not properly packaged to withstand shipping and the packaging material was insufficient which led to damage to the table top. All in all, even though I only paid $14.99 for it, I returned it. Sometimes a good deal isn't worth it."
5,GREAT for the price I paid!!!,"Got this when it was 15 dollars with free ship, was suprised how easy it was to put together and how sturdy it was after my husband made a few adjustments, so if your not handy with adjusting then you might have a problem with this, overall, for the 15 dollars and free shipping that I paid, can't beat it, even if it only lasts a year, it was and will be well worth what I paid for it, got it pretty much to keep the kids off my kitchen table and destroying it so they could do arts and crafts, but so far this table is very sturdy and I don't see it falling apart any time soon, glad I purchased this!!!"
2,Not the Same Don't Dress for Dinner,"It should be known that the other reviewer in this topic who Reviewed Don't Dress for Dinner is referring to a very funny play by Marc Camoletti, not by Robin Hawdin. I have not read this particular play, so I have no input on its merits, but I don't want others to be misled."
2,Pavarotti's 70th DOB,"I was disappointed in this as it is a compilation taken from many previous DVD's that I have purchased. It is not a Gala Celebration like his 25th, or 30th. These are all repeat numbers from various other recordings etc......alas....."
4,Well done!,"I suspect that individuals who have not yet heard the call to solitude will have trouble understanding the attraction. But for those who have, this book is very nicely done. I recommend it without reservation to anyone who would like a sort of sampler of writings about solitude and the hermit life. One small thing, however. This excellent book deserved much, much better proof reading. There were egregious errors (1939 for 1839, and more of that sort). The author could have been better served, after preparing such a fine book. Having said that, however, it was still worth reading."
4,Eye Candy!,"Outstanding photography is the highlight of this book, but the text is rather sparse, emphasizing breadth (74 total skaters) over depth. Although there is little here to learn for long-time skating fans, this could be an excellent introduction to skating for those new to the sport, as far as the ""eligible"" world of figure skating goes (no professionals are included). There doesn't appear to be as much pro-Canadian bias as there is in some books that come from that country! The only significant omission seems to be Sasha Cohen - understadable, though, since she sat out the previous season with an injury. So, again, I would give this 5 stars for photography, 3 for text."
2,i thought i would get better,"I got this book and was excited, but they wrote about such pointless stuff, its good for a quick ref i guess. They also didn't include skaters such as Sasha Cohen (:}) but oh well, don't buy it!"
1,Over-priced,"Bought it because I had to. Nothing I can do about that. Sorry for the low grade, but I hate over-paying for books I'll only use for 2 months."
2,I could have made a better desk,"This desk is okay if you don't move it around, but if you move it the desk part ,that is attached to the chair, it moves and then kind of rubs on the chair leaving marks."
5,Great Camera.... I love it....,I love this camera. Moreover I bought it on Amazon for $123.00 in March 2007 which was an amazing deal. (Not sure if it worth the current price of $300) It works great... A friend of mine friend bought 2 of these at the same time as me and he is very happy with them too... It is pretty small to carry with you and clicks great pictures. Its a great buy.
4,"Great camera, Look Out on the Price!","It's as small as it looks in pictures, but it's thicker than it appears too. The camera is very handy though. It fits comfortably in front pants pockets. The camera's zoom is limited, as can be expected of a portable camera. The 5.1 mp isn't bad. However, I can tell a bit of a difference when it comes to zooming in on pictures in comparison to my bulky 6.1 mp camera. But that is self-evident.The camera is mainly for point-and-shoot operations. You can manually change is ISO and other settings, but if you're interested in specialized images, you might want to look elsewhere.My old Fujifilm was great, but took bad night pictures. This camera has none of those weaknesses. Night images come out very clearly.I haven't figured out how to work the games on the camera yet, but I think it's a really cool function.I would definitely recommend this camera, but not for the $200+ it is selling for. I bought mine for $140 and so should you!"
4,Nice Camera,"It takes great pictures, just what you would want for a point and click camera. I would have given it 5 stars, but in bright light/outdoors, it is hard to see the LCD display. Otherwise, its a great little camera. I would recommend purchasing this camera at the price I paid for it/ about 139.95."
5,Fuji Finepix V10,"Once again Amazon have topped the hit parade, dispatching the camera to an hotel in New York, arriving beautifully gift packed ready for the arrival of my wife. Wonderful service, I cannot thank them enough for a fantastic price which could not be beaten . The camera was pristeen and was soon storing pic's for me to enjoy on her return."
2,"Above Average Looks, Below Average Pictures","This is the first time I have felt the need to write a review. This may be a stylish looking camera with a price that you cannot pass by, but you really should. The images taken on this camera are grainy, pixelated, and a huge disappointment. Save yourself the hassle and do not buy this camera. This customered just returned his."
5,love this camera,"love love love this camera.Simple, easy to use, just point and shoot. I handed this off to my husband with no instructions one day and said ""take some pictures""! He turned it on, saw the button for taking pictures, found the zoom button and was off! He was so impressed, I kept telling him that Fujis are really intuitive and now he believes me!Takes wonderful pictures, nothing to complain about. Does fine in low-light, outside, sunny days, cloudy days. I haven't found a situation where it doesn't work well. There are all sorts of manual settings you can use if you want to, having fun with the dual picture option (takes two pictures in a row, one with flash, one without flash), or just let the camera decide for you based upon the situation.Definitely recommended to my friends, and I just LOVE the orange color. Sure makes it easier to find when you put it down on a covered end table! :)"
4,Fujifilm Finepix V10,"I bought this camera for a my wife for Christmas this year,she loves it especially the extra large lcd screen. It takes good pics too!The only setback was the 16mb card, didn't hold many snaps. Upgraded now to 1gb nd all is right with the world!Nice compact design fits small hands well too.It is also relatively simple to use, she is no techie, but is able to work it just fine. Got it for a GREAT PRICE TOO!"
2,I'd like to like this...,"I was really excited to buy this camera because of the large screen, the good name (fujifilm), and the games. I had seen that Consumer Reports online had given it ""excellent"" in print quality, so I was completely dissappointed to find that the pictures were extremely grainy. Some of the pictures I took were acceptable, for instance, shots outside or in brightly lit areas.I was taking pictures of a baby shower which took place in a living room with open windows, and none of the pictures are clear. Also, for most of the pictures I zoomed in slightly or a lot, and none of the zoomed pictures were clear at all.I would not recommend this product."
4,The Extras,"The camera is as the reviewers said, small, easy to use, large display. My wife said, ""oh, I can use it to show friends pictures of our twins"". Yes you can with pictures saved on the card. I don't know if you can transfer old pictures onto the card easily though. (Update: You can transfer pictures from your computer but it may be out of sequence depending on the file name)On to the extras. Despite the low cost, I bought the two year extended warranty as friends have had their little cameras break for all sorts of reasons. I also bought from Amazon the case to protect the screen and the lens from accidential opening. Oh yes, I also bought a 1GB card as the 16MB card held about 16 2MP pictures. This added about $70 total.For the price, a very nice deal for everyday picture taking."
4,excellent camera but ISO is too sensitive,"For the price of this camera on Amazon you won't find a better deal. Camera itself is really nice. Very good ergonomics. Easy to use and navigate. Higher capacity xD card and a case is a must. Makes great pictures outdoors using AUTO ISO. Indoors I needed to change ISO to 100 or 200, otherwise if left in AUTO camera selects ISO on the high end. It selected in 600 range where 200-400 ISO would be enough. Picture became very grainy when ISO is above 400. It might not be noticeable on 4X6 prints, but when you view your picture on entire monitor screen, ""noise"" is very noticeable. Just manually change ISO setting from AUTO to 100, 200 or even 400 and you will get a very good quality picture. Overall it a very good camera considering all fitures, picture quality and price."
5,Digital camera a sucess!,"This camera was purchased for my daughter for Christmas, she wanted a colorful camera that had a larger screen and she is thrilled with this camera. She also wanted a thin camera, her last digital camera was rather bulky. This camera has everything she wanted and she loves the quality of the pictures too!"
3,Returned it,"I was really disappointed with this. We bought it to replace a 4yr old Olympus, mainly because it was supposed to be so good in low light situations. However, while it had more natural flesh tones than the Olympus, we didn't think the low light was much of an improvement. We tried the mode where it shoots one pic w/out a flash and then immmediately takes one with a flash, mainly doing so in rooms at night in various levels of light. Then we took shots from the same angle with the Olympus. Other than better flesh tones, we saw no real improvement over the old olympus. The pix taken without the flash were nearly always blurry, and even when not they almost always looked better w/the flash anyway.The LCD finder was pretty cool, and the menus were fairly easy to use (the software I didn't like), and I don't want to dissuade people from buying a perfectly acceptable camera. But it is not the low light champion that some Fuji fans would have you believe."
1,If it was reliable it would be ok,"I went through 2 of these before calling it quits. The first one arrived with a broken lcd, so I would urge anyone getting this camera to treat it like a carton of eggs. The second one arrived and worked for about 10 photos. After that it would no longer power on. In addition to having a camera that didn't work, I now have 2 useless xd picture cards that won't work in anything other than Olympus or Fuji... and after my Fuji experience I'll pass. I decided to spend the extra money and buy a Canon SD630. In the V10's defense it took decent pictures before it died and I posted them just in case my review doesn't scare you away from this camera! Also, I have had at least 5 or 6 point and shoots prior to this and NEVER had any problems whether they were casio, kodak, hp, sony, or canon, or my nikon DSLR. Also Amazon had AMAZING customer service and accepted the cameras back with no problem!"
4,Nice camera,The first camera that I received stopped working after a week or two.I contacted Amazon and they worked quickly to resolve my issue and send me a new camera.So far so good. The camera seems to be working fine. For starters i like the size of the camera. Its small and compact.The picture quality is also really great. Its much better than the Kodak that I have.The large screen comes in handy but when outside in the bright sun it can be hard to see. That is really the only time that I have needed a view finder.And the games really come in handy when I am bored!!!I have no complaints with this camera at this time. I have only had the camera for a few weeks though so that could change. But lets hope that it doesn't.:)
4,Cheap camera for a good price,yay! Got the cam for [...]+ free shipping and just mailed out the [...]rebate form.I took some pics without touching anything right from the box and picture quality came out to be very grainy in low light conditions. Then I adjusted the ISO setting to ISO 64 and pictures got a whole lot better!
5,Great gift,I bought this camera to gift as a gift my mom. She is not a tech savvy but found it extremely easy to play with. Simple menu options and large screen fits her style perfectly. I love fuji cameras coz of their menu options. In fact I have only used fuji camera's for last 6 years. Keep upgrading to a Fuji. Cannt ever go wrong with it. :)
3,Not all that great!!!,"I picked this camera up for my boyfriend because I read the reviews and it seemed to be a good option. We're in the film business and I wasn't looking for anything high-end, but I did expect more from this thing.- The screen is extremely grainy- The picture is decent quality, but this thing struggles deeply with lighting issues (takes a long time to focus and still proves a soft image or overlit most of the time.)I really wouldn't have many complaints if it wasn't for the fact that I got my parents a Kodak Easy Share 4 or 5mp and it is easier to use and produces much better pictures. We just got this thing, so I'll keep you updated.Overall, he wanted a thin camera he could hold in his pocket and take anywhere. Well, he's got it, I just hope he can get a decent shot occasionally.* My recommendation would be spend a little more, do some research, and stay away from this ""cute, little orange"" camera."
3,Great in bright light... not so great in low light,"This camera takes beautiful pictures in sunlight or brightly lit indoor scenes. The huge screen is fantastic for reviewing pictures. However, the low or ambient light pictures I've taken so far are not so hot. There are often artifacts in the images and a general blurriness that makes them look ""soft"" around the edges. To be fair, I see these inconsistencies more prominently when reviewing the images on the computer, while the printed 4x6 pictures seem pretty good. I would recommend this camera for amateur digital photographers who don't plan on printing large prints. It's compact size and easy to view screen make it a nice everyday camera."
2,Poor picture quality,Picture quality poor compared to 5mp Pentax I had. Also have had problem with the lens cover not opening all the way when I turn it on.
2,Lens Cover Started to get Stuck.,"I owned an old Fujifilm S5000 (3.2M) and I was really happy with that. However that one is very bulky and I needed one that fits nicely in the pocket. The V10 fits my needs perfectly about the size of your palm.Because of its size, its bit awkward at first taking photos, but you get used to it. My reason for the low 2 star rating is when you power the camera up, the lens moves out and a plastic protective cover opens up. This plastic cover keeps getting stuck and not opening up completely, I had to push them open with my fingers.It takes decent pictures, but because of the broken unit I got, I had to return it. Anyone else see this problem?"
3,Fuji V10,"Nice cam for the money; but, big screen washes out in bright sun, so even a small viewfinder would help. Movie mode-noisy motor. Convenient to charge battery in camera. Well made ,all ss. Port covers flips won`t last long. Picture quality VG"
4,Great Camera For The Price!,"Bought this camera for my wife. She loves it!! Takes GREAT pictures and is small (fits her purse easily) and easy for her to use. Would recommend it as an easy to use, inexpensive (relative) ""point and shoot"" camera for the average user."
3,Ok camera but could be a lot better,"Overall, the large back screen immediately brings a lot of positive ooohs and aaahs. In fact, pictures look quite good when taken in regular lighting and in Auto Mode. However, any pictures not taken in auto mode do not have stability control and therefore usually lack any focus. So for pictures that you would like to take at night, this camera may not be a good purchase item. Many pictures come out blurry without the Auto Mode and you feel frustrated when trying to capture moving objects. However, for plain pictures, the camera is absolutely great and the price tag is very affordable"
3,"good camera, ok pictures","i've had this camera for almost a year. i like the camera itself. it is small, not too heavy and has a big screen for looking at pictures you have just taken. there is very little camera lag and it takes good, quick shots in low light. i just up the exposure a bit in iphoto afterwards. the battery lasts a long time and you don't need a special charging cord so if you forget to pack it or whatever you can probably find something else to do the trick.but i don't care for the picture quality. i used to have a canon and though i did not like the camera the pictures looks good even when i blew them up. if i zoom in just a little with this camera is looks fuzzy. if you care about the quality of your pictures i wouldn't recommend this camera but if you just want to document your life and print some 4x6s it's fine. anyone with artistic aspirations should move on."
3,Warranty or Not?,"My daughter purchased this camera back in May - without a warranty. She really liked the camera but after a while a problem developed. No local camera shop would work on it so we ended up mailing it back to Fuji in hopes they would handle it. Yup, they can and will, for a mere $82.50. Hmmm..."
2,Go with something else,"I bought this camera for my boyfriend so we could take behind the scene shots when we are on film sets. We just got back from working on a feature in Trinidad and 90% of the pictures are so grainy. The LCD image is grainy and I knew that, but this thing has no idea how to focus, especially in low light.If you don't want to ruin a priceless experience with terrible pictures then get a better camera."
4,Great Camera with Bad Red Eye,This camera works great - but the red eye that shows up in pictures has to be 10x worse than any other digital camera I've used. Maybe there is a setting I have set incorrectly or something. Other than that it is a high quality product that feels very expensive and sturdy. The screen is just beautiful.
1,Camera must be defective,"I bought this camera six months ago for my son's birthday and it has been nothing but trouble. We are inexperienced and new to digital cameras so we didn't know this wasn't how cameras work. First, it freezes after a couple of seconds or blacks out and can't be used for a minute or more. We started to hold the power button down the whole time to keep it functioning and then quickly slip your finger over to take a photo. What a pain.Now it completely froze with a open lens and readsFocus error on the LCD> Too late to get a refund and can't figure out how to get a replacement through the online return center. Just kicks it back to me saying too late for 30 full refund.I will never order electronic's online because now I am stuck with an obviously defective camera and out 150.00 with no recourse.This sucks!"
5,VERY GOOD,IMAGE QUALITY ON THIS CAMERA IS VERY GOOD. LOW LIGHT SHOTS ARE THE BEST I HAVE SEEN WHEN COMPARED WITH OTHER CAMERAS FOR THE PRICE. PAID 150.00 FROM AMAZON.
4,Nice pocket camera,"Have had it for a month, simple, nice photos, seems sturdy. My wife likes it so do I. Priced ok for all the many cameras out there in this category, it fit our needs.CONS... buttons are VERY small my (my wife has no problem) I do worry if view screen scratches what then? Not as many preset settings as others.Overall I am satisfied with Amazon purchase, price and delivery. Yes we bought the orange one too.ENJOY LIFE...look at the alternative!"
4,A good option,"High ISO and large screen were the reasons for my purchase. The screen is great but, when you force the ISO 1600, it seems to darken the pictures more than in 800. I have a S5200 and that one seems to adjust other options like white balance much better when an ISO is set w/o having to go to full Manual option. Definitely something to improve! The auto option seems to work much better and I was surprised with how good the high speed three frame shooting works. Also, the two picture function(it takes two with slightly different sets automatically) saves me on a lot of 're-posing'"
4,recommended,"good camera! back is all screen which is great. good settings, good zoom, good quality. definitely recommend!!"
4,Good for the purpose,"I bought this camera for a small, put-it-in-your-pocket snapper, and it works VERY well for this purpose. This is by no means a high-end camera, but it captures colors vividly, but is a bit loud especially at low ISOs and the images seem (to me) to be a bit more noisy and less sharp than they otherwise could be.It's nice and cheap, and does the job well!"
4,Perfect on the run camera.,"Bought this camera for my son for Christmas and loved it so much I just ordered the orange one for myself. The color reminded me of Hermes. LOL!!As with most Fuji cameras it picks up such nice color. It is about the size of a cigarette pack so it fits nicely in your pocket or purse. Games are a plus if your into them while sitting in the airport.So far the only setback is that when zooming in distance it produces a grainy picture, but I knew that before I placed the order on the second one so that should not be s deterant if you are looking for a fun, simple, portable camera."
1,poor quality,"I had this camera for one week and then I dropped and it hit the edge of my desk and then I caught it. It would not work at all and it cost more to ship it to Fuji than to buy a new one. Also I couldn't find the warranty card they swore I should have even though I didn't throw anything away. It was nice for the week it lasted, but definately not worth it."
5,A real gem,The striking beauty of Tenzin Palmo's tenacity is richly enhansed by Vicki Mackenzie's fine-honed ability to paint with words. A Rembrant of a writer and a Diamond of a subject. Wonderfully inspiring and deeply touching. ShantiMayi
3,"Fascinating story, mediocre book","The story of Tenzin Palmo is what makes this book interesting, not the writing itself.I appreciate the author's choice of including many quotes from Tenzin Palmo but I would have preferred reading either an autobiography or a less seemingly biased biography."
2,Borrowing,"It was to long to develop the story and seemed unbelievable, I won't recommend to any one, not my choice of reading"
3,Fantastic story but poorly written,"The story of Tenzin Palmo is incredible, the things she has done, the adventures and the hardships and finally her enlightenment. She is an astonishing women especially when you consider the times she lived in.Sorry to say the book is poorly written, the writer doesn't do her justice. A couple of chapters really dragged on pointlessly and it was all I could do to force myself to finish them. The writer obviously has her own agenda that doesn't seem to fit in with Tenzin Palmo's outlook on life.The life and adventure of Tenzin Palmo is worth the read, don't feel guilty skipping the odd chapter if you find it off topic."
1,Not enough Tenzin Palmo and too much Vickie MacKenzie,"This title is _very_ misleading, rather, it should have been ""One Feminists Interpretation of Tenzin Palmo's Life and Work."" I had high hopes for this book but found that only 1/3 of it was actually biographical. Yogins and yoginis are a tight-lipped bunch, to be sure (regarding their experiences on retreat etc.) so some of that can't be helped. What was substituted for Tenzin Palmo's experiences was the author's infusion of American feminist thought - not a problem in and of itself, but not why I bought the book. I would recommend that anyone looking for an objective biography of Tenzin Palmo look elsewhere; for those looking for a feminist paean to Tenzin Palmo, this book is for you. Despite feeling cheated in my purchase, I would say that one truly redeeming quality of this book is that a portion of my purchase goes to help Palmo build her nunnery."
4,Outstanding comtemporary jazz recording,"This recording I first heard being played as background music in a prominent Houston vegetarian restaurant, and I was so affected by itsbeauty I got the manager to go find out the title. When I found it wasproduced in Japan even though it is a recording by an American, I knewI might find it difficult to acquire by a local dealer. I turned toAmazon and was delighted to obtain it for my CD collection. I continueto listen to it at home; it does not gather dust as I am so fond of it."
4,Convenient,"This is a great product for any internet telephone service - all you do is plug this into your home phone jack, then plug in your internet phone service modem into one side. It makes that jack and every other jack in the home available for use. You are also no longer as restricted in selecting your computer location, since the additional line cord length allows you to place your computer on the opposite side of the room from your telephone jack if necessary. Furthermore, since it is a line cord rather than just a dual jack module, you can utilize the jacks with the rotating locking covers."
4,Works,"What can be said? It's a phone line with two jacks on the end. I have a DSL modem plugged into one and the phone plugged into the other and they both work fine. Nice length if you have to run line, as I did. I haven't had it for long, but I don't see what issue I would have with it later."
2,phone line cord only - not good as a dual jack,this dual jack does not work very good - (actually not at all in my case) - so what I am left with is a very long telephone cord which I do not need. I used to use dual jacks just fine - but now it seems I need something more which I found on ebay - so now I am up and running. The dual jack probably does work as well as the jacks at the dollar store - so if you need something like that with a long cord then you would be all set.
2,Poorly made junk,"If these were $40 I'd give four stars for the value. But I paid $72 each for two and all four wood pieces came with some scuffing and scratching. Also, a couple of the plastic feet on the bottoms of the poles have molding defects. Finally, you have to waste time adjusting the screw points to make sure all the poles are straight. The mount points on the poles aren't just precision drilled to line up correctly.In short, these are overpriced Chinese junk. Amazing that you can screw up packing up two wood disks and four pipes, but this manufacturer managed it."
4,Works real well,"I wish the stitching on the case were a little sturdier, but otherwise this is a quality leather case for the H10 that makes it easy to get at all the controls. The clip design makes the player a lot easier to carry on a belt, since it allows the player to rotate freely when you're sitting down, etc. And a special shout-out to the folks at MisticAudio--I called to ask if I could purchase a replacement for the clip after I lost it, and they sent me a couple of replacements for free. Now that's customer service!"
2,Review of book purchased on Amazon.com - Oliver Cromwell by Samuel R Gardiner,"It was difficult to determine the condition of the book. There was no picture of the book and the condition was described as ""GOOD"". ""GOOD"" is a very subjective term. The book is very brittle and will probably fall apart if I try to read it."
5,INTO THE HORNET'S NEST,"Very good book, my wife and I both enjoyed reading it. We are looking forward to more books by the author. We are school teachers in the Pomona Unified District and thank God we don't have many administrators like her Mr. biggs. P.S. We are both former students of Dr. Meinberg and her classes at National University. Good Book Dr."
1,Big Synchronicity Disappointment,"I have heard much about Jung's theory of synchronicity mostly informally. I have even cited it as a theory I subscribe to over the years. This book proved to be a great disappointment by lacking any substance, significant insights, or explanations in the few areas of the book I even bothered to review. That is not to say that a complete cover-to-cover reading would result in the same conclusion, but I find little that would motivate me to explore this book cover-to-cover."
2,Not worth buying,"I bought this book after reading I, Vampire. I, Vampire is not a perfect book but presented interesting ideas and showed a lot of promise. I thought that Romkey would develop as an author and the books would get better later in the series. Instead, this book, The Vampire's Violin, is a much poorer novel. Instead of adding more facets to his world, it just repeats the same information. The characters are less interesting, the story more sordid. I, Vampire is about a man's conflict within himself. The Vampire's Violin is less insightful and reads more like a television miniseries. I will note, however, that Romkey's musical knowledge is excellent."
2,A Disapointment,I have never read any other books by this author and thought I would give it a try. I did not like it. The book dragged on and on. What it amounted to was a fictional history lesson. The book was suppose to be about a girl who was given a 'special violin.' That turned out to be a very minor point of the story. Since the book was part of the series I would assume the others have to be better?
2,Message gets lost in redundancy,"I found this recording to be so annoying that I did not listen to completion. Although the writer's voice is rich and beautiful, I found the way that he kept CONSTANTLY repeating lines for emphasis to be incredibly irritating... incredibly irritating. Not wanting to subject anyone else to this recording (despite the topic of spritual growth being of genuine interest to me and many others that I know), I literally threw it away -- which was a bit painful given the excessively high price-tag. If anything, read the book(s) instead."
2,Slightly Entertaining,This is the first book I've read by Klein and I have to say that it was written very well. That's about it. For the most part the story was boring. Once in awhile it would pick up the pace which would soon die off. The end left me with the feeling of what the hell happened? I hope Klein's other works are better than this one.
2,More smoke than bacon,"There is a ton of creepy atmosphere in this book, it is obvious to me that Klein is a connoisseur of the genre (probably appreciates Lovecraft). The characters were fine in my opinion, each unique. WHat I did not like at all was that after the slow buildup of the story I was expecting a really explosive climax that never materialized. Instead it seemed to me as if it all fizzled at the end. The author is quite good at keeping the disturbing and uncomfortable atmoshpere churning, but is appears as if he was reluctant in letting it all come to a close. So that ultimately the story has a very unsatisfying ending."
2,Atmospheric Weirdness,"Picked this up from ""Horror: The 100 Best Books"" by Stephen Jones. It's a rather long, languid, and atmospheric rural Christian gothic novel. This book sure does seem to have its fans, but I found it to be more sleep inducing than thrilling. Dense and elaborate prose weighed this book down, and much great detail of the Amish-like country folk and their beliefs. Draws heavily on Arthur Machen's short story the ""White People""."
4,Great book for managers,"This book gives an overview of how factoring works and the lingo. This book could be helpful to business owners/managers looking for cash. Its important that the managers/owners understand that cashflow is important and how factoring (often viewed as expensive). Actually is required sometimes to recieve funds for growth. Sometimes manager's and owner's have a hard time understanding that rapid growth causes a cash flow pinch and can be dire. They view the interest as excessive but is generally better then a loan. A loan shows on the books and can bring down company valuations, increase your debt ratio and hamper any future loans you may require."
5,Excellent Meco Electric Grill,This grill is the best for my needs. I don't have to worry about filling up a tank and running out of propane.Cooks all meats and veggies with no problems. So its a pro all the way around. The rotisserie is great as well.cooked a few chickens on it and they were perfect. Would not want any other grill. I do use and extension cordand it does not affect the grilling of the temp at all. I use it several time thru the week and every weekend so far.will use it in the cold weather as well. Great product for the money..................
3,Meco 9329w Deluxe Electric Grill,The Meco Grill is an OK product. Grilling fine but cleaning the plate rite under the heat coils (it is attached)is a pain. The plate and coils should be separated so cleaning is easier. Maybe if this happens it will cause less flare ups.
2,electric grill,I'm still getting used to electric grill after using natual gas weber for twenty some years. Can't get the charring that I like.It could use an metallic drip pan that could then be covered with foil.
2,electric bbq,"I am VERY dissapointed in this product. I've had electric BBQ pits in the past and that's why I bought this one; however, it doesn't compare to any previous ones I've had. The element is not set in a position that will cook the meat properly."
1,Never again.....,"This grill didn't even last 6 months before breaking down. It never did assemble very well; cheap materials made for off-kilter alignment of lid to bottom so it would never close. Food slid off angled grill onto deck floor. I'm going back to Patio Caddie, although I will likely get the Patio Bistro this time. The quality of construction comparison is hands-down in favor of the Patio Caddie model. I hope I'm able to protect someone from a disappointing purchase thru this testimony."
3,Not Really For Me,"Too early for full review....used it only 3 times so far. Seems to work O.K. One thing I could say for sure! The slanted grill design is horrible. Food slides down all the time, and could fall onto the floor if your not ready for it. If Meco redesigns their grill cooking surface horizontal, I believe their product sales should increase."
4,Electric grill,Compact. Few options for condo owners who like to grill out. Fairly cheeply made out of stamped metal. Cooks well however. Taste is similar to gas grills. Can't comment on durability.
5,Great Grill!!,"Works like a charm and no gas or charcoal taste! Rotisserie works perfect. I bought thebaskets that go with the rotisserie, just set it and forget it!!"
3,Like the Grill however....,They did not ship the Lock Nuts and only one wing nut! Kind of hard to put together when you don't have all the parts! No time to contact seller since this is a Christmas present and need to be put together before then. So off to the hardware store I go to get the extra parts. Thanks a lot.
3,It not great but it works,I read the reviews and chose to try it out at my own risk. What I have learned from using this grill is that it does not get to the temp that I like and the angle they but the grill at makes all my meat to fall forward and have to close the grill and quickly as possible to prevent the meat from falling off. But it cooks the meat and I can use it at my apartment.
5,Lucid English,Perhaps one of the best introductions to philosophy in English next to James Collins and Copleston. Joad has a terrific writing style and is very very clear in articulating difficult philosophical ideas. An absolutely terrific book you will read and reread.
4,What can you say about screws?,"As every other review says, they're screws, and this gives you a lot of them for a decent price. It is incredibly easy to strip the screws though, so be careful when you use them."
4,Saved My Bacon,"Dell likes to mount its cooling fans with cheap rubber mounts that give way in a couple of years. In the last 12 months, I 've had to replace the mounts on 8 servers, each with 2 cooling fans each, and I used these. They work really well, they are cheap, and are easy to thread into the mounts. Keep a fist-full on hand."
5,They do exactly what they are supposed to.,Not much to review here but I received them quickly and they work in all the fans I've used them with.
5,excellent product,"These arrived quickly after placing the order, and are fabulous - I use them in shoes, slippers and boot to help relieve plantar fasciitis pain in my left heel.Great product!"
2,Not what I was hoping for.,"I had high hopes when I purchased this remote trainer. When it worked it was okay, couldn't tell much between the settings. Sometimes it made noise but did not zap the dog and other times it would give her a good zap. It worked very inconsistently and didn't have a range over much more than 10 feet. I would not purchase this item again or recommend it for anyone."
1,No effect on dog,"My dog didn't react on it at all! Thanks to dog's trainer, who was here to try. Otherwise my dog would kill a cat"
4,Good customer support,"I bought this as a replacement for the same model in which the rechargeable battery finally died after 8 years. So this time, I bought the battery operated collar. I did have problems with the initial synching of the remote to the collar and thought at first I had purchased a bad battery....so I bought another battery, and still couldn't get it to work. I thought at first I had received a dead product, so I called Innotek Customer Support. They were very helpful and knew right away what the problem was....turns out there was a mfg defect in which the battery prong did not touch the battery correctly. All I had to do was bend the prong out a bit and it worked fine. The only thing that bugs me about Innotek is that they have shipped all of their mfg out to China (which explains the mfg defect). The collar I purchased 8 years ago was made in the USA! Had I known this beforehand, I may not have purchased."
1,Frustrated,"I purchased one on the recommendation of my sister, who has one. (Our dog has serious front door issues!) When it arrived, the battery screw would not fit no matter what we did. So I returned it and ordered another one. This one worked ... FOR TWO HOURS. Two zaps (on the lowest setting) and it completely died. I must say, it did work as far as getting our dog's attention and stopping the ""door rage,"" but now it is completely dead and I'm done with it. I will try another manufacturer. (Other reviewers seem to have the same problem, I should have listened to my gut!)"
2,Disappointed,"I bought this collar for my Lab/Rot mix. I was slightly disappointed at the amount of time the setup took. What was worse though was the length of time it took for the remote to actually activate the collar. Walking my dog on a 6 ft leash made the collar nearly unusable. The corrections were not instant as needed for proper training, they took too long to be given and at that point there is no connection between the shock and the behavior. For the price I expected a much higher quality collar."
1,does not work,"Does not work i would like to return for a refund. please send me a contact number at trexpaddle@yahoo.com All it does is make beeping noise and no stimulation. i have canged the setting with assistance from innotek. my dog is easy and not stubborn,ijust wanted to discourage her from running up to other dogs while off leash."
1,Collar works but no training DVD was included,"Took around 9 - 10 days to get to me. Compared to any other product i previously purchased from amazon.com, this one took quite a long time.Anyway, collar works fine but didnt receive the Training DVD that was described in the Amazon.com Product Description. So since i am new to this I dont really know any methods. Do i shock my chihuahua when she does something bad?I feel this wasnt worth the money and was a waste of time. I expected at least everything that was described in the description to be included.All i can do is google search or search youtube.com. Unhappy with product."
1,Worked good for a little bit,"The collar was good while it worked. The range is awful now; it only works at about 6 feet.I've replaced the batteries again and again, but even with fresh batteries it doesn't work for distance anymore. Also, a lot of times the shock doesn't work; you have to get it so tight that the dog chokes and I have to be close enough that I might as well just hit the dog with the remote rather than shocking. I'm probably going to switch to Petsafe as they make the wireless fence collar we use and it's worked great for about 6 months"
1,It didn't work at all!,"My sister has an Innotek remote training collar for her dog, so I thought this would be perfect for my high-energy 2 year old Lab mix. I was so excited to use it that I immediately opened the box, put in the batteries and tried it. My husband and I tried to figure out which setting we wanted and what it would feel like. It worked for literally the first 5 minutes and then the receiver stopped getting the signal from the transmitter. We called Innotek to see if we were doing something wrong (we weren't) and they sent out a replacement unit. When we opened the replacement unit, it didn't even work for the 5 minutes the other one did! I returned the first unit to Amazon and will never use this product again!"
1,You do get what you pay for,"I had a Tri-tronics trainer that lasted for years and was rugged and easy to use. This Innotek collar is junk in comparison. No real on/off switch (you ""pair"" two red buttons), minuscule battery cover that is impossible to open and close, setting the levels requires a magnifying glass and a very tiny tool that you must furnish, the snap for the collar is cheap plastic, the whole thing is cheap. Mine just died after two months."
1,Stopped working after 2 weeks,"The collar worked well at first -- transmitted slight, annoying but not painful shock (tested on my hand). Range was OK, but not great. Then totally stopped working after about 2 weeks."
3,Great if it kept working.,I'm on my second one in less than 2 weeks. The first came with a battery that lasted barely a week and when I replaced the battery it got stuck. It frequently stops working just when I need the correction the most like when my huge puppy takes off after the cat. Then I have to remove it and sync it again and again. I've had the second one for a week and the battery died. I have not even been able to consistently use it so overuse isn't the issue.
1,waste of time and money,"we purchased 2 of these at the same time, when they arrived the batteries appeared to be run down , i guess where they had been on the shelf for some time.anyway i went out and purchased new ones for both the remote and the collars, and after following the instructions about setting the units up, (pairing them) they made the necessary clicking tone noise when the button was pressed, but as for any shock value it was a waste of time.i managed to shock myself but the only way this was possible was to press down as hard as i could against the 2 probes that shock, the only way i could have got any shock value to my dog i would have had to had the collars so tight on the dogs neck it would probably have choked him before zapping him.i have returned both of these for a refund, which will hopefully come through ok, you wont be able to return in as new condition as you have to cut open the plastic packaging to get to the units inside."
2,Pay too much for replacement batteries,"This one has a relatively short range, but it is a good product. We spent a fortune on replacement batteries. Suggest one that has rechargeable ones."
1,cannot use this item,"Cannot even figure out how to adjust the ""zap"" on this item. There are no directions. We've had it for about 4 weeks and cannot use it! It stinks & we want a refund!"
3,battery,It's a great product I can let my akita run in the park LOVE IT.the one problem that I see with this product is the battery not even 20 hours of use and the battery dies. Battery very expensive.10.00 a piece.If it were not for the battery it would be worth the price.Annette
1,Try the petsafe version instead!,"This was awful! Went through the setup and it worked perfectly. Testing on the dog and it didn't work. Seems to have a range issue. Changed batteries and tested range with device sitting upright on table. Stopped working at ~10ft. That's right, 10 FEET! Sent it back and ordered the PetSafe PDBDT and it works well, even through the house. Dog is running much less and listening much better."
3,Good product while it works.,"I LOVED this set the first time I bought it. After about 6 months, it just was dead and wouldn't work again, even with new batteries. The SECOND time I bought it, thinking I did something wrong. I loved it again the first 6 months. The THIRD time I bought it (still thinking I did something wrong), I loved it only about 2 months before it died AGAIN! At this point, I realized I was not doing something wrong and was irritated beyond belief at that point. I could never get an answer from Innotek as to why this kept happening so I decided to move onto another collar system.Moral of the story is: don't buy this product!"
3,All items not included in shipment,"You don`t get the vcr video in the package as advertised above. There was none in the shipping box when I opened it, just the collar and no instructions, good luck."
2,Stay away from Innotek,"We've purchased several of these Innotek brand dog training collars over the years with the same results--they either broke or drained the batteries quickly. The craftsmanship of these units is flawed and they only work for a few months if you're lucky.You'll be happy initially because the collars do work for the short term, but you'll be constantly buying batteries because they run down so fast.I have decided that I will never purchase anything from Innotek again because of the poor quality and design of all their products. Not worth the price even if they're on sale, which by the way, they often are because word gets around about the horrible performance of these devices.In short, stay away from Innotek and save yourself some money and frustration."
3,tessa,"I have a boxer that is always tryin to run off, get in trash, or just run the house. I bought this with hopes that it would help with the training and get her under control. I have been using it for a few months now and it has help some. I did have to set it on the hightest setting and sometimes it still does not work, but it has made a difference. I like that the collar has a beep sound along with the virbration. I guess the biggest problem I have with the collar is the range.. I would like the range to be greater.. our dog had a bad habbit of running off to either our neighbors down the road or the neigbors behind us that is behind a wooded area, once she gets so far the collar does not work. we try to keep her in our yard but sometimes she gets gone before we know it..So yeah the collar works and it does help with the training but I would like a greater range on the collar.."
3,pretty good,This works on my shepherd but I have to put it all the way on 7 for her to if she gets excited...think her hair is stopping it on the lower setting...also not very good instructions for setup...had to call customer service to get it up and running the first time
4,Absolutely Delightful,"This is a fabulous collection of three of my favorite romance authors. It was such a bonus that it concerned the paranormal in a very fun, almost Bewitched sort of sensibility.Lori Foster's story was wonderful for the trademark way her characters love each other and make appropriate moral choices around minor children.Lucy Monroe writes sex scenes with a whole new attitude and twist and I love it! I also adore her heros. I had read The Real Deal in the last couple of months though so I had some idea her story would be great.I adored Dianne Castell's story; it was warm, loving, and funny in a big way. The cloakroom, the boathouse, the greenhouse, the roof! It was hilarious! And the dialogue was that snappy, fast paced talking that was so fun in the old t.v show Moonlighting. I loved the way this woman writes.You really won't go wrong with this purchase."
5,"""GREAT""","I wish i had bought an electric Bar-B-Q years ago. What a difference in taste/ease of cooking/and $$$ saving. I would never again use propane or charcoal. This is the ""GREATEST"" purchase of this summer.Mel Pearson"
3,"Easy to use, but a bit of a clean-up afterwards.","Grill heats up quick, cooks food well and quicker than propane or charcoal grills and is easy to use. It is a bit of a messy clean up for a grill, though. Assembly wasn't too bad, but the box came with all those little tiny styrofoam balls that got all over the place and made a mess while unpacking. Connecting the wheels was also a pain."
1,Breaks after 12 months and no-service from company.,"I purchased this grill and it was very good for the first 15 months. The grill rotates to be a rotisserie as well. I rotated the grill to the rotisserie and the grill shorted out and is now a door stop. The grill is only warranted for 12 months so if you want a grill for longer, look for a different manufacturer. I would not recommend MECO as a company."
5,Potomac CAD buys a great grill!,"We were hosting a business event for our Potomac CAD clients and purchased the Meco 9359W Electric Grill because we couldn't worry about the possible fire hazzards of Charcoal or Propane. While we thought about the loss in the quality of our Bar-b-que, we found that this grill cooked the meat perfectly! Everyone was impressed with our use of electric for many reasons but mostly because it cooked some great food and produced some wonderful flavor. I would recommend this grill to any backyard cook and businesses as well. - Craig Chaney, President, Potomac CAD, Inc."
3,Yet another compilation,"Don't get me wrong - I am a huge fan of the Blow Monkeys. But I purchased this album hoping for SOMETHING different about the songs it compiled, only to be disappointed. If you have the albums, there is no need to buy this compilation. In fact, half of the catalog on these guys are nothing but repackages of the same song versions, so buyer beware. If you really want to add some Blow Monkeys to your collection, I recommend picking up their first 3 albums (Limping for a Generation, Animal Magic, She Was Only a Grocers Daughter) and ignore the rest. Really."
3,Nice but little boring..,"I bought this cd hoping to hear some other nice songs such as ""Digging your scene"", ""It doesn't have to be this way"" and ""This is your life"", unfortunately the least are these good songs. For me, in total there are 5 good songs, found it boring. However, if you like 80's music and you collect cd's this is a ""nice to have"" cd."
5,The BEST!,"My Boxer had 9 puppies so I knew I had to find something large and sturdy. Boy did this saucer deliver! They LOVE it! It's perfect, especially for a large litter. It proportions the food nicely so that all the puppies get equal amounts. Great product!"
4,"Be patient, and it'll pay off","When I bought this book, I had absolutely no serious programming background. I was pretty accomplished in HTML, but nothing advanced. At first, the book was a bit hard. But the technique that I found helpful is to re-read each section (or each topic). I haven't even looked on the CD yet, and I'm learning loads about Perl. Also, reading this book really helps one understand some more advanced Perl tutorials on the web. It doesn't get 5 stars though, because the reader has to really be committed. This isn't a light read: get in the thinking mood when you read it."
3,Potential to be good but lacking some source code.,"This book had the potential to be very good and I did learn some things from it, but many of the example results lacked the source code that generated the results. In addition, much of the source code that was in the book was not on the included CD."
3,Rushed into hardcopy,"QUE must have pushed this book into print. As other reviewers have noted, one has to have dogged determination and stamina to digest this book. It presents a confusing, unrelated and diverse array of ""my pet way do it"" by several authors. The examples on the CD are pathetic - all lumped into one directory, no readme file(s), incomplete and therefore not runnable as-is. Example: to extract the files related to Ch 9 required sifting through the entire chapter, and then register.htm and its CGI backend were conspicuously missing. However, after bludgeoning my way through most of the book, I have extracted a small number of gems that are actually useful in real-life projects. The CD contains this whole book plus two others in HTML format. A nice idea, but each one is disorganized by a totally different team of people. There is no unified 'look-n-feel' and navigation is painful in all three books. Good as a reference, shop for it 2nd hand (and pay only what it is worth)."
1,It is Not GOOD don't buy it,"the fisrt chapters are clear, then the book starts to use strange statements and never explained so i didn't read it all I have thrown it in the garbage..."
3,Not for serious juicers!,If you just need to do one or two limes or lemones. If you are doing a lot get ready for carpal tunnel to set in.
3,"Great manual juicer, Cheap electric is easier to use","This is a great bar juicer especially when there is no electricity. When juicing 10 pounds of oranges, an electric juicer is better."
4,A journey into the Universe: Both Levin's & the Cosmic one,"A nicely put diary of two universe's; Levin's & the cosmic one.Suggested for readers of all levels. It serves as a great introductory text that provides a summary of the work of the universe, those who study [ like physicists and cosmologists ] and time.Being in the form of a diary it was a geat first-time experience, specially as a science-based text.Moreover it provides an idea of how a physicist or cosmologist is just another person living a normal [ rarely beyond normal ] & problematic life. The diary takes you on a journey through time & place in Levin's own personal life [ through all the good & bad occasion ]. It proves to you that physicists are not aliens or weirdos, but just human beings like any other in this planet."
3,Spotty,"Janna Levin has a real talent for explaining some big ideas from physics in a clear and simple way. This book is at its best when she is doing so. Unfortunately, it's merely boring and annoying when she is agonizing over her wimpy boyfriend, the dreary British weather, the overcrowded London Tube, and so on. The transitions between the two threads are always abrupt and often contrived. It's as if two different authors wrote different books, then shuffled the pages together. If Levin had left out the schoolgirl-diary stuff this book would be half as long but twice as good."
3,Dissapointing End,"Great beginnings but a poor end. The sceintist fails to take a position on her scientific observations and opinions, and tries to relate it to her personal life. Very good book, but dissapointing end. Yes, I am over age 13. My son is a theoretical mathematician, so I understand the peculiarities of the abstract thinkers."
4,Importance of Philadelphia Negro Study,"This of course is a seminal study, but was extremely enlightening since we don't realize that a number of African Americans were free and living in urban settings with their own insular communities and organizations. Although it is filled with graphs and staid sociological comments it is an important lens on life among negroes 1840-1880's."
2,Item shown not sent!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I was very excited to see this particular kotex with velcro wings online since I had not been able to find them any where in stores. I ordered it immediately! However, when I received the package it was a different fit of kotex then the one I was so eager to receive."
4,A breath of fresh air!,"This cd has rough beats , and rough rymes. This cat Streetlife has mad street cred. His skills on the mic are rugged. This is real hip hop. Way better than the crap rap you hear on New York radio. Thank you Streetlifeand Method Man for this gully cd. It is well appreciated. Solid purchase!"
2,Real Street and No Beats,"I don't know why anybody is giving this more than 3 stars??? Yes he can spit pure fire, but with the weak ass beats behind every song how can you enjoy this at all. Also what's with the Yo, yo yo yo yo before he spits on each cut???I am a old Wu Head and I always give Wu family a chance to shine but this was too much. Trust me when I say he is better off doing guest spots on other Wu realted material."
2,Ouch,"Man, Streetlife was the bomb on Method Man's albums. Naturally I assumed that a full CD of Streetlife would be hip-hop bliss.Its more like hip-hop *iss. I agree with a few of the previous reviews by others here in that the the lyrics are good, but the majority of the music is just flat and boring.There are three good songs:Cant Stop, Wont StopDescriptionsShoot on SightI expected more and I expected better considering the talent that Streetlife is. Three hits out of 15 tracks is not going to cut it.Not only do I want my money back, but I want the time back that I spent trying to fell this."
2,"Works, but image is misleading.","The image incorrectly shows model # TL26164, which has a detachable coupler. The model # TL26571 in the purchase description has the extension coupler permanently wired into one end of the cord...it's one-piece, not a 25 ft. cord with a separate coupler."
3,It has its moments but is ultimately uninspiring,"This is an average album from a decent band. Or a decent album from an unexciting band, I guess we'll have to wait for a full-length to really tell.There's potential here. Nice Corgan-esque vocals with energy and emphasis in all the right places and a healthy dose of rocking guitar work, but the songs never really go anywhere. They all have their moments, but the only one of the seven songs on this album that actually feels fleshed-out is a cover. Not a good sign. The rest of the songs just take a catchy hook or an appealing melody and repeat it a bunch of times.So, again, hard to tell if it's because the band is no good or just that this is their first release and they haven't quite found their groove yet. If the latter is the case, I have high hopes. Either way, I do at least recommend checking out the first song, Kissing Families, and then making a decision from there as to whether this EP is worthwhile or not."
3,"Starts Strong, Finishes Mediocre","After hearing Kissing Families on KEXP, and reading the reviews here on Amazon, I thought for sure I had found my new favorite Indie rock band. Though I still think Kissing Families is a great, great song, filled with wrought emotion, the other 6 tracks of this EP failed to deliver. I kept wanting more emotion from the band, but was always left unfulfilled. Oh well, next band please."
4,"Listened first, then bought it.","I read some of the reviews here, and it left me wondering what I would actually find on this album; so, I looked it up on Rhapsody and listened to it. It turns out this is earlier Silversun Pickups, and it sounds like... the Silversun Pickups. If you like the Silversun Pickups, I suspect you'll like this album. I listened to it on Rhapsody and now I'm buying the MP3 album."
5,12 Years After Siamese Dream...,"...this band finds the torch that Billy Corgan so carelessly dropped in '93 and makes it their own. Much to their credit, they feed the flame with art instead of ego."
3,OK for first effort,"I'm sorry, I love this band but this album ain't the greatest. Only 6 tracks, 7 if you count the incredibly annoying track at the end. They give you 1-6 and then 13 blank tracks and then add a track at 20. I HATE it when bands do this. Do you really think that by making your album LESS LISTENABLE you'll be attracting fans? Its the same way with Carnavas in that they add 2 minutes of dissonant noise to the end of what is probably the best track on the album. I guess THAT one's not going in my ipod. It's just so juvenile and I have to call bands out on it. And there are MANY bands that still do this and need to be told NO!Anyway, if you love Carnavas you'll probably hate this album. The melodic sound they find later just isn't evident yet. There are a few bright points but not enough for me to recommend."
3,"Good Album, but listen to Carnavas also","The album is good, ""kissing families"" is a good track especially, but it's also the only one that really hooked me. If you arent familiar with Silversun Pickups, listen to their latest release Carnavas and then pick up this one."
3,Not as good as some....,"Generally speaking, I like this Janet Dawson series, mostly because I like the Bay Area setting. Reminds me of my many years living there; Dawson does a great job of making it real again, lots of scenes she describes are exactly like I remember them. That said, this book isn't among her best. It drags -- not as easy to sustain suspense or interest when the setting is a typically drab and gray corporate office, ie, ""Cube City"", which proves just as boring to a reader as it was to those who worked there. Time and again, I skipped hunks of pages in the middle, as the character analysis of this corporate executive or that corporate lawyer exceeded my ability to care. I'll still be on the lookout for more in this series, though -- just hope the others will have a little more action."
4,Good book for beginners,"This is an interesting and easy to read book. It provides the reader with an in-depth explanation of Bollinger Bands and its interpretation and application. The book expands a bit more on how to apply the bands to trading strategies, but it falls short on a more detailed trading system with the bands. For instance, stop-loss, entry, exit, ect. It is a book about the study of an indicator, and that's about it. Nonetheless, it is worth reading!Unfortunately, the book fails to provide a more detailed explanation on the most interesting aspects of the bands: The squeeze. The squeeze of the bands itself does not tell the trader too much, except that the price action is bound for a strong move. However, it is possible to combine other indicators so to have a solid idea which way the move is going to occur."
3,Too much superflous waffle,"This book wasn't all that bad, and there was some worthwhile trading information in it, however it could've have been half the size had the author not wanted you to know how ""really really"" smart he was. As a result of this it included a lot of waffle about unrelated history about non trading/investing matters. Still O'Neill did it as well, so did Sperandao.......why do guys who've made a few bucks in the market and turn themselves into authors confuse themselves with Einstein?"
4,Very Good But Not Great Book,Learn B Bands from the man who invented them. Not the best investing book in the world but a very good book. You can make money if you follow his rules.I had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Bollinger at a seminar and he is a very decent man. He is one of the few knowledgable good guys they have on CNBC. CNBC should give John B and John Murphy a show together on technical analysis.CNBC should fire that creep James Cramer and some of their other flacks like Suze Orman.
2,Too Thick for Bollinger Bands,"I forced myself to read throughout this book. The closely relavant information about Bollinger bands in this book is something like 10 to 15 pages, some of can be found in standard TA books. I believe the Author should have written a TA book and included Bollinger bands as its one chapter. It is so boring to read a book made of by extending a chapter of it to a book."
3,Ok but I wouldnt spend any money on it,"Did not get too much out of it that wasn't obvious to anybody that uses Bollinger bands. ALot of reading but not much content; you can get the info in this book by just reading about the bands on many web sites. Spend your hard earned money on something like ""How To Buy"" by Justin Mamais that gives you alot of advice."
4,Some New Good Idea...But Not Enough...,"I've bought this famouse author's book with a lot of expectation. And then, I've been inspired several new idea from the book. Since I've been learned about the Bollinger Bands, I've expected to get a lot of New and Powerful idea on this book, but not much... However I found some New idea like that price reaches the peak when lower band reverses its direction, and I'm likely to read the price action more accurately and easily than ever before. Only with this idea, the book is worth buying.Recommended."
4,Rational Analysis,"I wanted to know more about Bollinger bands because I saw no real use for them except as a channeling tool. There's more to it and I liked what was learned. Definately not a stand alone tool, but highly usefull. Some interesting strategies for the squeeze with the head fake, and walking the band. Will subscribe to his website as soon as I feel I made some money off of what I learned.Remember in the stock market theres no sure thing, even the best technical indication is still a (gamble) bet; the best we can hope for is that we're right more often than wrong. Amen."
1,Don't bother under these conditions,"I bought this coupler to put two 25' phone cords together (the cord between the hand set and the phone itself). We were always stretching a single cord beyond its limitations when talking on the phone. However, when using this coupler, I could not get a clear connection between two cords. I tested both cords (at first I thought I had a defective cord) but I determined the issue was with the coupler. Perhaps it just should be considered only for line cords (between the wall jack and phone) that do not have tension."
4,Just what I was looking for...,I was looking for this one piece for my phone at home and I couldn't seem to find at any local store;let alone know the name of it.But I found it on Amazon and ordered it and it works like a charm.Thanks...
4,It works okay,What more can one say other than it works just as it should. I plugged in the cables into both ends and everything works just like they should. Both connectors I ordered work well without any issue or problem.
4,Does What It's Supposed to Do,I used to couple two lines. No problems so far with the unit. A very good value for the price.
2,Choices - A Disappiontment,"I hate to give a bad review but... ""Choices"" was a BIG disappiontment. ""Choices"" is about a disabled high school athlete, (played by Paul Carfotes) and his girlfriend Carri. (played by Demi Moore.) I am all for rooting for the under dog but please... This movie is so bad it put me to sleep.When I went back to watch this movie a second time I was still very lost. ""Choices"" is suposed to be about a disabled athlete and his girlfriend. However, I did not catch on to what the the problem was until the movie nearly ended.All actors did an ok job given the weak story and dialogue. One actor I was impressed with was, Victor French, of ""Little House on the Prairie"" and ""Highway to Heaven"" fame. Of all the cast, I think victor gave the strongest performance. Victor's performance is also the reason for my two star rating.In my opinion, spend your money on something else. Chances are, this movie would be collecting dust in your collection."
4,The Best American Short Stories,"I bought this book after looking at some of the names on the back. Especially appealing were, Saroyan, Cather, Wharton, Harte, Dos Passos and Anderson. The stories selected from these authors were not the best of their works, but overall it is a good sample. Additionally, there were some suprisingly good stories from people I had never read before, especially Zona Gale, whose ""Nobody Sick, Nobody Poor"" was excellent. Overall, a few stories (The Gold Bug) are let downs, but most are excellent and worth the time to read."
1,not great at ALL,"Why in the WORLD do people love thsi so much? The plot IS innovative, but that's where it ends. It is completely unrealistic, and the art is NOT gorgeous but only so-so. Maybe I've been brain-washed by Yuu Watase's artwork, but if you really want a great manga, I suggest Ayashi no Ceres (Ceres: Celestial Legend)."
3,3.5 stars in my book,"I'm pretty new to Rotersand's music. ""Welcome to Goodbye"" is my first introduction to the band. Rotersand may not be VNV Nation or Apoptygma Berzerk but I thought ""Welcome to Goodbye"" was enjoyable. There definitely is a Pink Floyd element in the band's music especially in the vocals but for the most part Rotersand's music is your standard EBM. The production is perfect. It has a good live vibe to it. There are lots of good hooks and good beats. Tracks like ""Dare to Live"" and ""The Last Ship pt. 1"" made me want to get up and dance. Unfortunately what plagues this album is repetition but then again repetition often plagues many electronic based music. ""Exterminate Annihilate Destroy"" gets pretty tiresome after a couple of minutes of listening to the obnoxious synthesized beats.The same can be said about ""Almost Wasted"" except the beats aren't so obnoxious. ""Welcome to Goodbye"" is good, not perfect but good. I have definitely heard better EBM cds than Rotersand's recent effort."
3,"Not very deep, but an interesting read","This book is a mix of fundamentalists' stories, former and present. It's light reading, not terribly deep, in my opinion. It suffers from credibility in that either the author or his subjects chose not to give their names and often their denominations or locations when telling their stories; thus everything together seems somewhat vague and generic. And it's not terribly fair to lump all fundies together this way; just because one church or group believes in strict subordination of women doesn't mean the next one will. The book has some interesting and thoughtful insights from the author's subjects on how the minds of fundies work, what makes them tick and why they cling to such obviously unscientific hogwash (in some instances). Each chapter is a slice of life, but unfortunately it's not overly nourishing. If you want serious analysis look elsewhere."
3,"Good interviews, but lacks conclusiveness","In ""Growing Up Fundamentalist"", Stefan Ulstein has collected a series of interviews which cover many problems and positives (though fewer of these) in growing up in a fundamentalist tradition. The interviews are sensitive, interesting and well-conducted. Ulstein seems, however, to shy away from drawing conclusions based on his data, or from offering solutions to these problems. He also appears to have a bit of a religious agenda of his own, in that he included many interviews with those who are still practicing Christians, and fewer with those atheists or agnostics. It would be interesting to do a statistical survey to see how accurate the percentage really is. A good and interesting, if not great, book."
5,A Great Kid's Desk,"My 2 year old absolutely loves this desk! As a matter of fact, so does his 11 month old brother. We'll probably be buying a second one for him in the next few months! It arrived in perfect condition and was fairly simple to assemble. Both of my sons love to sit at this desk to play or eat snacks and they also love hiding things in the drawer under the seat."
1,Absolutely ridiculous,The publishers of this book have certainly got poor taste. They have the Artist's name wrong. They probably also did not acquire proper copyright permission from the Artist or others. To comment any further please go to Chughtaimuseumlahore.com
3,Some special effects please,"A bit cerebral, most viewers will likely need to watch it more than once to pick up the subtle nuances Hal Hartley likes to interject in his movies. Still, more or less an interesting story line that tickles the curiosity whether or not aliens from distant planets could live among us, and if they do/did, would the majority of us be able to recognize them? Being a fan of good special effects in scifi, the low budget character of this film almost ruined it for me; however, you can rely on the charisma/talent of Sabrina Lloyd here to raise it well into the realms of the watchable again."
3,WHAT WAS HAL THINKING?,ALTHOUGH A HAL HARTLY FAN.... I DIDN'T GET IT ?TOO DEEP OR OVER MY HEAD MAYBE? I JUST DIDNT LIKE IT AS MUCH AS HIS PAST WORKS! MAYBE SIFI JUST ISN'T HAL'S BAG?
1,Don't waste your time,"I'm sorry - I can think of zero reasons why any thinking person should subject oneself to watching this morass. I can't believe I just sat through it. I am so bummed out by its bland mush I can hardly type on here to warn others. (btw, WORST ""soundtrack"" I have ever put up with! Yuck!) Actually ""yuck"" is my reaction to whole mishmash."
3,Beginners Reference,A guide to stimulating reflexes in the feet to bring about relaxation in corresponding parts of the body. It describes the application of fundamental reflexology techniques. This book is suitable for beginners to practitioners. I do think that the diagrams could have been better.
2,It was ok-ish,"The book was informative, however, the illustrations and technique instructions were not very clear. I think this book would be much better if there was a dvd showing the techniques as opposed to just describing them."
4,Handy,"If you're like me, married to a sweety with several watches that are always either too loose or too tight, this is a very handy gadget to have around. Simple to use, not a lot of rocket science here & it saves repeated trips to the jeweler. Just work slowly, haste will result in a bent push pin or damaged link."
1,Stay away from this book,"Random ramblings on patterns sprinkled with ridiculous cartoonsdepicting fictitious sofware development meetings. The whole book barely has 100 pages, but if you eliminates the useless pictures and diagrams you're left with half of that."
3,A useful primer,"I picked up this book to get a general introduction to patterns and the thought process that ""might"" be used to apply them. This book gave me exactly that.I got a peek into the world of patterns and their application to enterprise architecture.This book doesn't have good examples. The examples could have been simpler and more business oriented. The author doesn't do justice to tying in the examples with the theory.Overall it is a good introduction to patterns."
3,A little too light for a book,"You can finish reading this book pretty fast because it's very short, as others already commented on. The good part is its three extensive examples covering such design patterns as the Decorator and Builder. I downloaded the source code and worked out the first two examples (one in C++ and the other in Java), while ignoring the third about gaming/playing cards, which is not a domain I am interested in. For the most part the code works except for a couple of bugs (e.g., missing destructor in one instance) that I discovered while doing code editing and compilation, which would probably have been overlooked if you only read through the pages of code. The reading and exercise were certainly helpful, at least for a better understanding of the few patterns emphasized in the examples. The detailed UML diagrams matching the code are also a good point for the book."
4,That Crazy Pigeon...,"My 15 month old girl absolutely loves the Pigeon books and this one is no exception. We read it several times a day along with the other board book, ""The Pigeon loves things that go"".While not as good as ""The Pigeon finds a Hotdog"" or the other Pigeon books aimed at older children it's fantastic for toddlers. The Pigeon's ever changing moods make it perfect for using different expression in your voice which children love. And it's short enough to keep their attention.As always the simple drawings are fantastic and the Pigeon has so much attitude!Very cute!"
5,8 month old loves this,"My baby loves this book. He was being read to even before he was born, so I know right away if he does or does not enjoy a book. So far he loves all the books I have from this series and I don't mind reading this one either. These particular books are a bit more entertaining for the adults too versus other childrens' books."
2,goofy book with rudimentary pictures,"Not good for babies...this book has bland colors, boring background and the sarcasm doesn't really fit in a kid's book."
3,No the size I was expecting,"Good book, but it was smaller than I was expecting. I thought it would be a larger hardcover book like the ones my son gets from his school library, but it was smaller and made with all hard pages like the toddler books."
2,Ver y disappointing,"My young son and I are huge pigeon fans, having loved the first two books. When I saw that Willems was releasing two new pigeon books, I was very excited and ordered them immediately. Perhaps if I had waited, I would have seen that these are ""board books,"" i.e. only a few ""pages"" long. Instead of a book demonstrating multiple pigeon emotions, as I expected, we touch on angry, sad, then happy, all in the course of less than a minute of (slow) reading time. I guess it's a cute enough book, but know that it is just a ""smigeon of pigeon,"" not a full book."
3,Needs more Pigeon,"As a parent of a blossoming reader, I enjoy funny books that get my child motivated to read and laugh. The Pigeon books have become some of our favorites as the pigeon always seems to find a way to make my daughter laugh. The Pigeon has feelings too! is a bit short; in length and in humor and I will be looking forward to another (longer/better) addition to the pigeon series in the future. I recommend that you skip this book, but please giveDon't Let the Pigeon Drive the Bus!,The Pigeon Finds a Hot Dog!, andDon't Let the Pigeon Stay Up Late!a chance. You will be glad that you did."
2,I guess I should know what a BOARD BOOK is...,"My wife & I are first-time parents of a now-10-month-old. My wife loves collecting children's books for our son and one of her favorites is the Pigeon series. I bought this book, along with a few others and was disappointed when I found that this was a very small ""board book"" with less than 10 very thick pages.That being said, upon re-visiting the page for the item, I did notice ""board book"" a few times in the description. I guess now I know what to look for - considering that I had no idea what that even meant at the time. But I can guarantee I won't be making THAT mistake again!"
1,Worst Pigeon book ever.,"My students and I LOVE Mo Willem's Pigeon books (and all Mo Willem's books, in fact). I don't generally buy board books because my students are too old for them, but I thought I'd make an exception. I was disappointed. The book barely makes any sense because the pigeon's emotions are not nearly as clear as in any of the other books (which is ridiculous because this book is supposed to be about emotions)."
2,Only for fans,Ugh. Other reviewers are right. 1)Way too short. 2)Meaningless unless you already know The Pigeon and (most importantly) 3)Not very good at actually showing emotions and faces -- The Pigeon looks nearly the same in all the drawings!!
1,Pigeon disappointed me,"I had heard of Mo Willems and looked forward to reading his book to my little 3-1/2-year-old friend. There is nothing substantive to this book. Emotions are expressed, but they don't go anywhere. There's no plot, no resolution of feelings. I read it my little friend, who has the ability to have fun with almost any book, but this one was disjointed and she was bored and disappointed. I returned it."
3,J. taylor,"I love ""Don't Let the Pigeon Drive the Bus."" This book just fell a little short of my expectations. My son likes it, and it is Pigeon, so it is fun."
1,Is this a joke????,"We got this book as a gift for my 2 year old along with ""Don't let the Pigeon drive a bus"". When I said the ""Don't let the Pigeon drive the bus is bad"", this one is way worse! Colors are awful, illustrations are horrible, and no any kind of sense in the text! (Sorry author, but this is ONE ugly book for the kids!). We ended up throwing both books in the garbage, because we didn't want any kid to be exposed to this."
1,Forget it; returned three,"Machine has a fatal flaw.The first one I bought did not work at all, and I replaced it.The second one was fine for about a month, then began cutting out messages when I accessed them remotely. Yet messages were there when I came home. Great, got to come home to get a message!ATT was very responsive and sent me a new machine. Worked great for three weeks. Hit the dust--same flaw re remote access--this week.ATT is sending me the 1722. Have no idea whether it too is defective. Let's hope not. Wish we were back in the good old days when Lucent not VTech made ATT machines.Only good thing I can say is that ATT does respond to calls.Do not bother to buy this machine. For $20 the hassle and lack of a working machine it is not worth it. Three strikes..."
1,Returned Two of These,"I had one of the earlier AT&T digital models, which worked fine for about five years. Then it failed, and I bought the new model. The good thing about the AT&T models is that they use flash memory, so messages won't be lost if there is a loss of power. But the new model seems to be flawed. At the end of a message, after a caller hangs up, the machine records dead air for about thirty seconds before it resets. I returned the machine and got a second one, which did the same thing. The second one is also going back to the store."
2,Won't reset after a power failure,"While it will retain messages, it won't reset it self after a power failure. So if the power goes out even for a minute, it won't record, untill you reset it."
3,Sound quality terrible...but customer service was better.,"I bought this machine after reading the positive reviews on this site, and was very disappointed to discover that any messages left on it were completely incomprehensible due to a terrible static noise that intercepted the caller's voice. I sent it back to AT&T and in about a month received a new machine. Unfortunately, this one had the same problem. So I called the customer support center, and the service rep offered me a higher-level model (phone and machine combo) at no charge and free shipping. He also said that these machines (1719) rarely have any problems, which makes me wonder if something in my house is causing the interference. At any rate, AT&T customer service is clearly making an effort, which is to their credit."
2,The clarity of the recorded messages is poor,I bought this answering machine because it looks good but I am very disappointed with the clarity of the recorded messages it is the first digital answering machine and it might be the same with all others but I used to have till now the one that records on tape and it is not to compare
4,just lovely,"I ordered these in Le Beige Naturel. Color is more of a sandy suntan, but very nice just the same. Smaller weave of fishnet, appears to be durable."
3,"Low budget....high performances, creativity and originality","Forget everything but the killer and his mind, because this is the center of the whole movie. Made in a, could I say, theater style, this movie shows the motivations, desires and secrets from one young man living alone surrounded by a (true) ambience, the one perfect for his creative mind work. This movie hides many secrets, could I say, messages, and repeated views would help to understand it. I could tell you more about the drugs, sex and violence this movie portraits, but I will leave it all for you to make your own conclusions."
1,Complete loss!,It didn't work....It didn't work....It didn't work....It didn't work....It didn't work....There's not much more to say other than that...didn't work.
1,I didn't get that book yet!,What do you mean by reviewing the book? I didn't get that book yet! Please help me out to get that book or money back!
5,Compelling telling of an interesting part of Sierra history,"This book is well-written and entertaining. I recommend it to anyone interested in the history of Sierra or the use of livestock, as well as to anyone who has spent time in the Sierra back country. The author does a wonderful job of presenting the facts in a manner that brings the era and the people alive. The history of packing is provided against the backdrop of the broader Sierra history, putting it in context that makes the role of packing clear."
1,Fit & finish is terrible,If you're going to put out such a poor quality product it would be better if you just passed. Materials are as cheap as you can get. Top of smoker does not fit securely. No integrity to retain smoke in smoker.The workmanship on this product is just awful. Really sucks!
3,Meco 5023i4 Smoker Review,"Overall the body of the smoker is structurally stable. However, when I was putting it together, I noticed the barrel was bent slightly and affects proper application of the lid. It is a very simple product to use, but requires attention to ensure the temperature remains stable."
2,no exhaust damper,"I was unable to keep a constant temp because there is no damper on the lid. I had to use a stick to keep the lid open slightly. Took forever to cook ribs and chicken and they came out slightly dry because of no convection without the damper. Barrel section was dented also. Very cheap design, I would not recommend this item when there is so many better ones for a quarter of the price."
2,Not true GE batteries,"I expected to receive GE brand batteries but received some offshore generic batteries instead. Obviously, I was a bit disappointed by that."
1,Absolutely disappointed,I bought this one for replacing my motorola phone battery. The battery package states my phone's model number as a supported phone. The battery life is horrible. Does not even last a day with one charge... it is even worse than the old battery that I replaced. I would definitely not recommend this.
3,Wrong author,"We were expecting a book authored by Louise Fitzhugh, as she was listed as the first auther. This book is actually ""based on characters created by..."""
3,A good read,"This was my second Susan Krinard book that I have read. It in no way measured up to Prince of Shadows, but it kept you going if just to find out how they resolved the problem of David being a ghost. There were a few discrepancies in regard to Al, one comment being his ""pinned up sleeve"" which led you to believe he had lost his arm, but then in another part of the book it mentioned him putting his ""hands"" around his glass. He supposedly had to walk with a cane, but managed to speed off through the woods... but that is just minor flaws. The book was good, but if you had a decision to make between reading Body and Soul first or Prince of Shadows - please pick Prince of Shadows."
3,skip it...,I agree with the reviewers-not one of her best.Plodding and boring to get through-downright depressing in some places. If your book budget is limited I'd suggust you skip this book.
5,Arrived safely,Bought these and others like it for china when moving. Don't buy the cheap ones and i also suggest the thicker felt discs for in between each piece. Our china arrived all in one piece and no chips.
5,Just what I needed,"My fine china has been taking up space in my kitchen cabinet for 30 years. During those years, I've probably used it only 20 times! It was taking up valuable ""real estate"" in my kitchen cabinet, so I packed them in these nifty storage containers and moved them to a storage cabinet in another room. It feels so good to have extra space in my kitchen cabinet, while still giving my china ""a place of honor"" in these well-designed storage containers. I truly don't know why it took me 30 years to figure out I could store my china elsewhere! I'm glad I bought these."
4,Works well,"Would not protect in a move, but great for storage in a closet. Great price, great product. They were exactly what I was expecting."
2,Not sturdy enough,It was nice that they came with felt to separate the dishes. One of the storagecontainers had a broken zipper. I didn't feel they had enough padding around them.I sent them back along with the matching storage containers.
3,Microfiber material thin and cheap,"The quality and thickness of the quilted microfiber material is way cheap. The price point is great, but the quality and amount of protection it affords is just so so."
3,Wise Children is better,"I read this book on the strength of ""Wise Children"" and I much preferred that book. There is nothing wrong with ""The Magic Toyshop"" but the story didn't resonate with me as much. Carter is a master at developing characters and this book is full of them. There is something decidedly creepy about this tale, but in an oddly pleasurable way. Definitely worth reading, and I will read more of her books."
3,"Very odd book, but beautifully written","I was totally lost as to what to expect out of this novel. Angela Carter's descriptions, especially of people, are some of the best I've ever read. I just couldn't shake this sense of menace and impending doom while reading the book. It has very gothic overtones. I was very fearful for the characters. (It didn't help any that the cover is very creepy). I mean, it is rare that recently orphaned British children sent to live with their Uncle (whom they have never met) end up in happy circumstances (at least in Literature and Film *smile*). Still, very different and interesting, and I LOVED her descriptions. The plot was very weird and different. The ending left me with a ""hmmm..."" feeling. Oh well. I'm still glad I read it, but what a strange coming-of-age story."
5,Rediscovering a dark classic,"I just read this again after almost 10 years - it's lost none of its power to grip you, and envelop you in its dark and twisted world.It's a haunting tale of growing up, that I remember being a revelation to me at 16, and at 26 it still stands tall."
3,Didn't work with Dr. Brown's large bottles,"I had heard this was a great bottle cooler, but unfortunately our large Dr. Brown's bottles were too tall to fit so we had to send it back."
4,Does what it needs to!,"I really like the playtex fridge-to-go single bottle holder. I have it and it's larger partner. I love them both. I leave them stored in the freezer and when I need to grab them they are ready to go without the hassle of wet ice packs. They save me and my diaper bag from condensation that melts off of ice packs. The single holder will not keep my daughter's bottles cool all day, but that's not what its intended to do... her bottles remain cool for about 4 hours... long enough to run a few errands. If I know I will be out longer I take my larger fridge-to-go carrier. I will definately continue to use both... great and convenient design."
4,Great for short outings,"This works great I love it for short outings. The only down fall is having to put the whole thing in the freezer, instead of just the ice packs. I also have to Platex Two bottle one. This one stays cooler longer as the ice packs ar much bigger. Better for longer trips out."
1,Costume,"The constume was missing parts, looked as if someone had cut the hood off the shirt, the pants were ripped."
4,Ninja!,Great costume. The only thing that my son did not like was that the hood is not attached to the shirt. It didn't look or feel right.
3,"Missing waist sash, runs in costume, poorly made","MIssing waist sash. Runs in costume, threads dangling all over the hem of the shirt and pants. My son enjoys wearing it, regardless of it being poorly made, which is why I gave it 3 stars."
3,You get what you pay for....,I is cheap and that is what you get but its a disposable one time use outfit anyway. Its thin so you will need to dress the child for winter and put this over it. It is true to size.
4,Good,"Nice one, because its fit to my son, he likes it,But the clothes is so tiny or petite hehehe but its ok for me."
3,Not exactly like picture.,"In the picture for this item the hood and the shirt are sewn together. However, when it comes to you the top of the shirt looks like someone just took scissors to it and the hood is not connected, but rather a single piece that you strap onto the child. The whole thing looks very cheap and the maker doesn't even take the time to sew the ends of the garment or even make sure the ends line up. As long as the child is only wearing this at night, its okay. Wouldn't let him wear it to school though."
2,"CHEAP, NOT AS DESCRIBED","This costume is horrible. It arrived with loose threads all over it, fraying at every seam, and the hood is not attached as pictured. The hood had two small pieces of velcro on either side to fasten it under the chin, however one of the pieces had come unsewn before we even took it out of the bag. Almost a complete waste of money; my son did enjoy wearing it."
2,hood not attached to shirt,The costume works well but the hood was NOT attached to the shirt it is separate and doesn't look right. Luckily my son has a red hooded shirt to wear underneath. Just wasn't exactly what I was looking for. He is happy with it and has worn it seveeral times to events before Halloween.
3,You buy what you pay for,"Bright color but poor quality. Hood came separate from the shirt, I have a sewing machine so I'll stitch it myself.My child likes it, that's the most important.Good deal for the money you're paying if you don't mind sewing a little bit."
2,Ok. Poor packaging QC.,"Received item quickly, earlier than estimated time. Item did NOT include the face mask as stated on package. 3 of 4 arm/leg ties were a shorter length and one was longer. Waist sash was fine. Agree with other comments about detached hood. Size information was hard to find. My 7 year old wears a 6/7 so I ordered a Medium and it was a good fit - roomy, not snug over clothes."
5,Made a great Ninjago costume,"This costume was great for a ninjago outfit. My wife paired it with swords that attached to the back and it looked great, plus my son was happy.We used it for one occassion and then it went into the kids costume bin. Im glad to say, it is still looking good and getting plenty of use.Would buy it again, and would dress my other boys up in it...might use it for a red powerrangers outfit this yearHere is the link for the swordsDragon Ninja Weapon Backpack Weapon Set"
4,nice costume,"pretty decent, very thin nylon and overall looks pretty much like it does in the ad photo. Except the hood isn't attached to the top. It has tiny velcro that is suppose to hold but doesnt really stay on his heaad. The other peices are fine, so its ok for his a kid's dress up. My five year old took a size medium and he's a size 6."
2,Not as pictured,"Order this for 2011 Halloween. My son loves it but gets frustrated. The description is misleading. The hood is not attached and no way for the hood to stay in place on the shirt. With that said the material is too short to tuck in the hoodie. The pic shows the waist sash long up to the boys knee. The longest fabric is only enough to double tie. My son is 6 yrs old 44inches and only 40lbs. The ties around arms, legs keep sliding since the fabric is a slippery type fabric that pilts. The face fabric does not hold up. It slides so I had to put Velcro on it to stay put. My son is keeping it only because he likes that it is red and had a cool skull, not to mention his grandma is going to fix it. Hope this helps ."
4,Red Ninja Costume,"My 9 yr old really wanted to be a red ninja for Halloween...this costume fit the bill. It is made of an opaque nylon with a silkscreen type design on the chest. Pants have an elastic waist. All openings are unhemed but neatly trimmed. There are five strips of black fabric strips to tie around waist, legs and arms. The face mask would not stay up, nor on so we left it at home. He was very pleased so I was too. This item is not fine quality nor durable, but for the price a good deal."
2,Not durable but kids had fun,"Flimsy material. We were very disappointed - the item is not as shown. There is no hood with the top despite it being described with it. I was hoping to exchange but the item was sold out so had to run around finding the right material to sew a hood on. In the end it would have been just as easy to make it ourselves. Red top, red pants, strips of black material - done."
3,Meh.,"My 5 year old son loves it, because he wants to be a red ninja. Poorly made, cheap fabric. It doesn't stay on him, sizing is a bit off."
3,It's HUGE but the ties are tiny!,"I bought the size larger than what I thought my son needed, so that he would be able to wear it a while. When it came he could actually pull the pants up to his air pits and the bottoms were still on the ground. It's probably three sizes bigger than what he needed. And the ties are nothing like what is shown. They are barely long enough to tie with nothing hanging down. In fact the waist one isn't even long enough to tie. He was so excited to get it, and doesn't want to send it back. And the hood is not attached like it says. It's just a piece of cloth on his head that gaps with the shirt. Not impressed!! There's not much I can do to make it work for him!"
2,Cheap,It wasnt impressed at all. It was different than what the picture was shown. The packaging had other costume pictures inside it and the hood wasnt attached as shown in the picture. Had to sew it on or there was a huge gap between costume and hood. The mask kept sliding off my sons face no matter how you tied it unless you wanted to suffocate the child it was pointless to try to put it on him. Not sure who made it but it was really cheap.
4,size,"again, it was larger than i thought it would be but he too will grow into it and has a brother he can share it with"
5,hit of halloween,"we got a TON of compliments on the costume! It was thin and came with a bunch of the ties that were all different lengths so I had to ""figure out"" what went where, but it fit him perfectly and he LOVED it (which is really all that matters) and the kids in the neighborhood liked it too! Again its THIN and you get what you pay for....but for the price its a WIN!"
1,kids ninja costume,Poor quality hood was detached from shirt and didn't have the mask that went over the face. This was a piece of crap I did not have enough time to send it back so I had to fix the damn thing myself. Will never order from them ever again.
5,Great for the price.,We purchased this product and are very happy with it. It is very comfortable unlike a lot of halloween costumes. The price is great and the quality is good. My son loves it.
1,Horrible,very misleading... hood is detached.. and broke.. no way to somehow attach it to the shirt or put ot on right unless I sew it on.... it's just a triangle hanging over the head.. hope we can get a new one given that we are overseas
1,Unhappy Aunt Tee,One of the pants legs is cut up at the bottom and there was another costume's cover (Superman) packaged with the shirt. I'm a very unhappy Aunt Tee right now!
4,great halloween costume for my 7 year old,"My son wanted to be a ninjago for halloween, we could not find a costume for him but we came up with this. It looks a lot like ""Kai"" from Ninjago and my son LOVES it. We bought the large but probably would have been okay with a medium. He is 7 years old is just over 4 ft tall and is about 70 lbs, we didnt want it to be too small. For the price, the quality is great and he cannot wait to wear it to his school halloween carnival."
1,DISAPPOINTING!,This costume arrived WITHOUT the most important part... the HOOD for the ninja and it has a HOLE in it!!! Very disappointing overall
5,Good price for the purpose,"Bought this for my 6 year old son who picked this item.As we know, costumes for the halloween are made of cheap materials.There is no docs like manual but I could figure it out by looking at the big picture of red ninja in the package.I think this has good price for the purpose compared to other online shops."
3,buy from this vendor with caution,"Cute costume, but not exactly as picured in the photo. The graphic on the chest is completely different. No skull or Japanese characters. Only two gold designs near the shoulders. My son likes it, but it is not officially what he picked out and I paid for. The material is cheap and thin, so you will need to wear clothing under it, but for the price, I would expect that. The ties are cool, and the fit is good for my very tall, 6 year old. I bought a medium, and he wears an 8 slim."
2,Missing a piece...,of the black accessorized parts. The part that is supposed to cover the face. It would seem to be that there should be some type of quality control check to ensure all parts are included in the package prior to mailing. How difficult can that be?
1,what you see is not what you get,"I was expecting two mold from the package as it is shown in the picture. But surprisingly disappointing it only come in one mold.Just be aware! The seller is very misleading, there is no where in the product description that saying you will only get one mold not two as shown in the picture!Dishonest seller!"
1,Interesting Grill,"I have the one with a window, HOWEVER, the grill has a SEVERELY STEEP incline and it is confusing to me why it is set up like that, it is not flat....you have to be VERY careful so the food doesnt go and slip on the floor.I'm just very confused about this grill and how someone made it."
3,Does not get hot enough,"We use this grill because our condo association does not allow gas grills. It does not get hot enough to char a steak properly, but it is fine for fish and chicken. Perhaps the solid metal grill type would be a better choice."
4,Timber Framer,"To date I have purchased three books on timber framing. I would buy anyone of them again, but this is definitely the best one for a lay person like myself. The guidance is easier to follow. I also liked the fact that he is not afraid to give specific names on where to purchase tools and supplies."
3,Neophyte realities,"This particular book is an overview. Nothing wrong with that, it's merely that I do not even approach the level the overview allows. Again, a fine book for an intermediate but not for My particular position in the process of learning timber framing. A book that is far more to My liking is called ""The craft of modular post and beam."" Written by James Mitchell. Way better for a beginner and a lot more incisive all the way across the learning horizon. Listening to Paul Butterfield's ""East west"" and am being pulled away from the typewriter! That is all!"
5,I actually used the methods in this book to build my barn!,"I actually used the methods in this book to build my 40 X 30, four-bent barn. I can't say enough about this book. From the dedication to the index this timber frame manual was crafted in the same manner as author Steve Chappell's structures: solid, precise and with artful beauty. This book teaches everything from the basic tools to advanced joinery and details everything you need to build a traditional timber frame structure. The illustrations are great and the exercises are extremely useful.""A Timber Framer's Workshop"" is an essential reference tool for anyone who's serious about timber framing."
5,A good engineering and classic timber framing book,"Very good book with philosophy of the design, with good engineering information. I found good details on joinery, how to equip yourself for timber framing. I was mostly interested in engineering and found a lot of information, including example on how to verify if joints are correct. It covers only classic timber framing, which means metal (nail, bolt, connectors)"
1,DONT BUY THIS - I DID AND IT'S A WASTE OF MONEY!,"This is by far the WORST movie I've bought. Where to start...1) DVD quality sucks. The audio/video don't sync up. The film is grainy, it looks like someone produced it on a PC with the lowest resolution quality. YOU-TUBE QUALITY resolution!2) The script writing is HORRIBLE.3) The acting is worse than the worst community theater group I've ever seen.4) The ""special effect"" makup is oatmeal and watered-down ketchup and chocolate syrup.In conclusion, the master copy of this movie should have been a ""BURN PROGRAM"" (play once and then destroyed, just like in the plot of the movie)."
1,AWAKEN THE MOVIE!,"My DVD box said the movie was in color, but mine was the color of of a washed out VHS movie. This is a ""Night of the Living Dead""- light. A group of bad actors with a bad script are held up in a secured house while there are zombies and a guy taking notes outside. The zombie make-up ranged from mediocre to rubber mask. The people seemed to know that only head shots killed zombies, although that was something that was just done and not learned. The box hides some of the ""mystery"" of the plot by describing the girl as an ""assassin's daughter."" The writer, director, producer, and editor are all the same person, Jeffery McMichael Bookshire. The real mystery of this movie is why Mr. Brookshire didn't star in this film. Do not waste your time or money."
5,I had some fun with it. You will too.,"Movies are escape, pure and simple. I like the raw energy of low budget indie films and find some interesting venues for creative exploration. This is one of them. I liked the story and the subtext of redemption was a plus. What it lacked in budget it made up in story telling. I recommend it."
5,Great Album,"I recently found out about Endif, and thought ""wow what a great and unique type of music!"" Endif delivers a hardcore electronic/IDM/power noize beat that will definately get your blood flowing. Some songs can be a bit darker, like Bolter, but they definately have a strong appeal to me. My favorite songs on the album are crackpipe,Blotter, and gritscape, they all just are great. Overall, this album is perfect, definately 5 stars. If you like Agonoize, C/A/T, Manufactura, and other industrial bands, you should definately get this CD!"
2,Just read the chapter titles and skip the rest,"All you will find out from this book is that you have animal brain and human brain, and you can switch. It will be repeated about million times as the only solution for absolutely everything. Affirming your day might work for people who do not believe in themselves - not for strong people that just want to master their skills. It was very disappointing and I am saying it using my intellectual brain. With all due respect it was a waste of time."
5,Valuable!,"i agree. i got this book to deal with a specific person in my life and found a whole new way to deal with everyone in my life. it's great. i wish they had tapes too remind me of the information or seminars to go to because it's the way i want to be. this book is essentially how to be happy and who doesn't need a little bit of help every once and a while. it's full of heart. i loved it. thank you. ""Switch!"""
3,Umm...a bit flakey...but makes many good points.,"This book will point you in the right direction when it comes to looking at the ""glass is half full"". It will help you look at life in a healthy and positive way. That being said, if you can't get past the ""Stuart Smalley"" feel, don't get this book. (if you don't remember Stuart Smalley go youtube it)"
5,Thank you so much!,Hello all - thanks for the great reviews. We enjoyed writing this book and hope it gives everyone who reads it a fresh perspective on how to live life!
4,A fun read!,"It's a fast paced, exciting novelization. When I pick it up, I can barely put it down. The way the film is detailed in the book, I think it's going to be a fun film. It's not claiming to be a materpiece, just a fun and wild entertainment ride.Also, the author knows how to use similies and synonyms and metaphors and analogies correctly. The book has many descriptions. I'd say it's written for a sophmore in H.S. reading level (in the honors program). It's by far not a tough read, but it can trip you up if you don't have a dictionary handle.Also, what I find interesting is how the author writes out the thoughts of Patience/Catwoman as though you're inside her head. Ellizabeth even adds her opinions a long the way as if she were there observing the actions of each scene. As a young novel it's great. It's not boring and moves the plot and story right along with no hang-ups.Needless to say, I can't wait to see how the film, Catwoman, plays out in connection to the book."
5,A little Spice and Sugar,Don't let the negative reviews KEEP YOU FROM READING this awesome book for any CATWOMAN fans like myself I was hooked ever since I started on page one!
3,Book,"Not the best porduct ive ever bought. It was an old used library book in ok condition. I was in a rush to buy it for class so i didnt search for better ones, a few of my classmates claimed they got new editions for a dollar more than i paid, had i had the time i wouldhave done so, not bad but not great."
2,a very trite read,this book offers a varity of theories both in relativity and in quantum physics. it tries to cover too much ground in this book and no theory is ecplored to a satisfacory level. some explinations are trite and others are not current. dissapointiong. too much time is also devoted to fraud.
5,Breaking the Time Barrier,"Have not read the entire book yet, but what I have read has been written very well. Not a big fan of most female authers as I notice a different writing style from that of men, but this woman has done an execellent job of creating a book that is both interesting and factual. It is printed in what I would say is 1 1/2 spaced lines so it makes for an easy and enjoyable read. Just let your imagination go and visualize the future with such possibilities, the potential is enormous! We can already travel in time in a limited way, get up in the morning and relive the afternoon all over again in the same day, but what is suggested may be around the corner is mind blowing. Buy the book!"
4,powerful writing transcends generation gap,"Picked up on a lark, I wasn't sure what to expect when I opened the book. Too young to appreciate the actual fight when it happened, I doubted if I would be able to get into the story. Powerful narrative quickly pulled me in. Ali's (and Mailer's) soulful journey captivated me and I was unable to let go of the story until long after I had finished reading. A book about the human spirit, Ali's personality is difficult not to love."
1,Over-rated author and a poor excuse for a boxing book,"Anyone who believes that this book is an authentic portrayal of boxing has never stepped into a ring and has no sense of history or perspective. Mailer hero-worshipped Ali, and could never write anything objective about him. Mailer knew nothing about boxing, other than the sensation of hitting a woman in one of his drunken binges. Mailer went to Africa, and could not write the truth about Zaire or its bloodthirsty dictator. He either did not know or could not write that the stadium in which the fight was held, for example, was a killing field for criminals who were rounded up before the fight to make sure the event went smoothly for the press and the tourists."
3,"Ali vs. Foreman, and Mailer vs. his own digestive system","Norman Mailer could do just about anything with prose, and what he usually wanted to do with it was celebrate Norman Mailer. So, what we have here is the story of two fights - Ali vs. Foreman, and Mailer vs. his digestive system, which was rendered ineffective from various elements in Africa, not the least of which being Mailer trying to interpret the varieties of black people [sic]. The parts about Ali/Foreman are vivid, unpredictable, and great fun to read, and the parts about Mailer are unbearably narcissistic and should have been kept in his journals. Mailer never understood that Ali's vanity was channeled into entertainment, while his own never rose above masturbation. Half a great book, half pathetic self-aggrandizement."
2,Silliness,"Ridiculously overwrought. Mailer seems to think that he can influence the outcome of the fight via a mysterious magical force in the air that he can get in touch with by getting drunk and doing stupid things on his hotel balcony. As a historical document, this book is interesting. As an insight into Ali and Foreman's personalities, it's good. But one walks away with the firm opinion that Mailer is a bleeding idiot."
3,Didn't work with my computers,"The product states that it works with CD-ROM, DVD-ROM products. The audio portion didn't work with either my desktop or my laptop. Worked just great with my DVD player and stereo system, though."
3,"Audio CD only, no video DVD encoding.","This wouldnt play at all in my DVD player, the menu never came up and it wouldnt even detect as an audio CD for some reason. It did, however, work great with my CD player and even allowed to find out my speakers were out of phase which I easily corrected by reversing the positive and negative leads for one of the speakers.I'll be looking for another cleaner for my DVD player as this one seems to be made more for audio and has no video features as far as I could find."
1,Don't bother,"My guess is if you can get your player to read the disc it just might work. Unfortunately for me, non of my players even recognized the disc. I have a PS3, Samsung blu ray, LG blu ray, and four regular Sony dvd players. Non and I do mean non of my players recognized this disc. Everyone of them gave me a disc error message. Unfortunately since I lost the Best Buy receipt, I couldn't return it. Fortunately I only paid $5 for it. Buy the Maxell disc cleaner instead, it works."
3,Did not work in car,"This is a useful product, good price, worked well in my Bose cd player. However, the cd player in my 2003 car could not read the disc, which is why I bought it. Just a warning....."
4,Lens Cleaning kit,"This worked really well. Used it on my Playstation2, my dvd player, and on my dvd rom. Everything started working really good after using it. I used it a few months ago and all is still working great."
2,no good for GPX brand,"Did not work for my brand of DVD player- GPX 5 year old antique from K mart. Wrapping does not specify which brand it will work for. I now know that GPX not one of them. player did not read cleaner, cleaner did not clean lens. I ended up removing cover on dvd plaYER, manually cleaning lens with cotton buds and rubbing alcohol- dvd now working again, no thanks to DVD lens cleaner. Worth a try though- cheap price prompt delivery."
3,it works,"i ordered this item thinking that it was going to be a cheap ""knock"" off! But to my supprise it actually worked! Although it worked it did not work as well as ithought it would... but it did work!! just make shure that you follw the dirrection (exactly) as read and heard on the audio cd and you will have a good experience!!"
3,"Ok, but cheap!","I bought this from Wal-Mart for $10 and it did work great the first time, but the label on the CD is nothing more than a sticker (come one Memorex) and it is now bubbling up and pealing only after using this disc twice. None of my DVD/CD/Blu Ray players will play this disc now. Wast of money, try something else."
1,Damaged my 6 CD Car stereo,"My old 6 CD car stereo had been having problems reading audio CDs. It sometimes skips tracks or declares CD to be bad once in a while. I bought the Memorex CD/DVD-Player Laser-Lens Cleaner to improve the situation. Now to my horror, the problem got worse. Not only did my player not recognize the cleaner CD, now its rejecting most of my audio CDs. Probably the brushes in the cleaner CD spread out the existing dirt on the lens. Don't think CDs with brushes are fancy anymore."
1,This works only for audio but does nothing to fix video,"After reading all the reviews on Amazon, I got tempted to give this a try for my DVD player to fix video, only to be dissapointed.This cleaner did not work on my DVD player which randomly decides to play a DVD or just spit it out. When the product arrived and I read the intructions and the kind of tests that this thing runs, it was obvious that the cleaner is only meant to improve the audio quality and has no tests for the video. This product is only good for CD players and not for DVD players. The item heading/description is misleading in that respect. If buying for a DVD video, you will just waste your money by purchasing this item."
1,Product was ineffective,The disk did not work on on a Mac Book Pro. Laptop still had problems reading CDs even after the cleaning process.
3,nice price..but,I thought I would be getting something I could use in my car cd player but when I got it the label said not really a good idea. Could not tell that from the picture and info
5,DVD cleaner,This item works well in cleaning the cleaning of the head and lend on a DVD player. Best buy in doing the job.
3,Good cleaner,"I tried this with my mac DVD,, it was not detecting some DVD's. After this Memtek, DVD drive is complete clean and works perfect now."
4,DVD/CD cleaner,Keep your DVD/CD player clean for optimal use and enjoyment. This is an easy to use tool to keep your machine clean!
1,piece of cr*p,"This is a very expensive piece of cr*p that didn't work at all. I tried several times to make it work on my dvd player. I had to open my player and clean the lens by hand. I gave the ""OptDisc"" to a friend and he had the same response. It probably only works for big chunks, which I don't get because I am a very careful dvd user."
1,DID NOT WORK,"I own two dvd/cd's and this cleaner did not work on either one. It did not get past the ""disk loading"" stage so no menu ever appeared. Since the cost was so small I did not even consider sending it in for a refund, I just threw it away.I do not recommend this product to anyone as a cleaner.Memorex CD/DVD-Player Laser-Lens Cleaner"
1,did nothing for me,"Well, it was cheap so I gave it a try. Nothing. It seems to have worked for some people so good luck. It was a car CD player which someone else mentioned below it not working in..."
2,sorry - didn't do the job for me,"i've given it 2 stars instead of 0 because after i used this CD, the sound from my system did seem to be a little better (the CD's were not skipping as much). but the bottom line is it didn't fix the problem as the CDs are still skipping noticeably, although not as bad as before. ... not sure if this has anything to do with the fact that my set has a 6-disk CD changer."
2,failed,"I bought this in the hope that it would cure a skipping, scratchy problem on my cd/dvd player. It did not. It does not mean the product didn't clean the lens, maybe it did. It just did not solve the problem."
1,STAY AWAY FROM THIS BRAND,"I've not found anything from Memorex that works right, try Maxell products from Amazon, you can't find better products and the best customer service on the net."
1,Ripped Offed!,"I can't beleieve I just spend $12.99 + Tax at Circuit City (in Long Beach, CA) for this worthless product! I thought all CD/DVD Lens Cleaners were the same. I tried using this one on my computer's DVD drive and it does not work! They should put a warning on the packaging. Its bad ebough that it won't do the job I wanted it for but I spent three times the real price for it! I just hope it works on my regular DVD player and my CD player so I won't have been completely ripped off. This will teach me to not impulse buy anything again."
1,Waste of money,"I thought, given the reviews, that this would solve my skipping problem, but it did not. If anything, the skipping got worse.Is there a product out there that helps with video skipping?"
1,Almost useless,VERY disappointing - 5 pretty much useless tiny brushes. I have a 10 year Memorex that is 20 x’s better than this darn near useless piece o junk – get Memorex instead!… and could the Woman’s voice be more annoying… I doubt it.
1,Unfortuately Did Not Work At All,"I purchased this DVD lens cleaner with high hopes, however did not even get to use it. After many attempts and getting ""cannot read disc"" error, I finally had to give up. Good news is that it was not that expensive, but not worth paying to ship back. Will just have to go to a store and purchase a better brand....."
1,Doesn't work for my DVD/VHS Recorder/Player,"I just bought this yesterday because my DVD recorder is getting a little fuzzy when I record shows off of my TV. I thought maybe I need to clean it & see if that helps. Well, no help with this product as it doesn't work for my player/recorder. I kept getting a message saying ""Read disc error"". What a waste!"
3,Its a cleaner..,Im not quite sure how well it cleans. I've never had a problem. I use it as a maintenance item. Just insert and push play Audio instructions do the rest.
1,Doesn't work on all DVD players,Even though I'd heard it doesn't always work I bought it anyway. My DVD player wouldn't read the disk...figures. :(
1,Not compatible with some DVD players,"Yeah, this product was no help. Apparently not compatible with my Roth alfie system. Did I miss part of the product description where it describes which systems are compatible? And... I almost hurt myself trying to open the clamshell packaging. Come on Memorex. Get with the green trend! You're killing us with all that plastic!"
1,Useless,"My Samsung DVD player would not recognize the disk. Upon insertion, it took a long time for the player to simply say, ""No Disc"". My player has no problem recognizing any other disc I put in there."
1,A waste of money,"This supposedly cleans the DVD player so that all your DVD will play flawlessly.....when I put it in the player the window read ""Disk is damaged or dirty"". This is what is was suppose to fix....."
3,Hard to tell,"I presume the product is a good one, but it did not solve the problem I have with my DVD player...still won't read the DVD's. Guess it just finally bit the dust."
2,bought 2---1 worked well 1 did not work at all,would not spin in my son's sony crx140e cd burner--when i checked it out the paper label on the top center had bubbled and would not turn in cd player?????????????????????????
1,DVD Cleaner,"It's hard to rate this as it wouldn't work on my DVD Player or my daughters. So, I bought a new DVD player."
