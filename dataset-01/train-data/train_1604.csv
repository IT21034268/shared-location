1,What?,"What the heck are these things supposed to be? The shoes look like they're from the 70's. And for kids come on! The only reason I'm giving the shoes a star is because they may be (groovy) for hippies!!! Moon shoes, come on! Use your brain!"
3,Well written but of limited utility,"In this book Prof. McGinn gives an extremely concise tractation of the five basic concepts of identity, existence, predication, necessity and truth. Each concept corresponds to a chapter, in which McGinn, after briefly delineating an ""orthodox view"", proceeds to describe his personal theories. The book is well written and easy to follow. Some of the points raised by McGinn are of outstanding interest, others are not impressive at all. By putting so much emphasis on his personal views, the author reduces to the minimum his dialogue with famous philosophers and this results in some cases in a not very complete dissertation. Although the book is interesting, I think it offers itself to a narrow audience, not because it is too specialistic, but because it does not contain extensive introductions to each topic."
4,The perfect road trip accessory!,A musical masterpiece! 'Born to Be Wild' will have you singing and dancing all night long!
2,Not as I though,"I am over half way through reading this, and will be surprised if I finish. I thought this book was going to be a biographical story about John Colter, but I am finding out it is really a (insert any mountain man's name here) type of book. Very little information about John Colter himself, just stories of people places and events during the same time frame as Colte's life.Really, I wish I would've paid much more attention to other people's comments before I purchased this book."
4,Colter's life fascinating - book does it justice,"Once I started this book I could not put it down. Colter's life is the high of great excitement and drama and the author does not let the reader down. Read numerous books and articles on Colter but this is full of new and interesting information and perspectives on the man. I very highly recommend this book. Plan on looking into other books by the same author - you will not be disappointed with it in any way. His treatment of Colter's life with other trappers, with the Crow Indians, his venturing into Yellowstone, and of course his legendary/famous ""Colter's Run."" All of them are presented by the author so very well."
2,John Colter: His years in the Rockies,Hardly about Colter. Mostly others that were supposed to have been with him. Writing style mostly narrative. Reads more like a text book than a story.
2,Weak Hero,"The hero in this novel was weak although very attractive he did not have any dominate qualities. He did not own any land, he was not a strong warrior and there are many times in the book his wife berates him and treats him child like. I was very disappointed"
1,Did not work for me,"I bought this for a camping trip with several friends and found that it worked great for the first couple of days. We were using this for more than just drinking water, also to clean our dishes both morning and night. By the end of our 4 day trip the flow was reduced significantly (drip... drip... drip...). I cleaned the outer membrane but that did not help. I returned it to Amazon for a refund and will look for another solution."
4,Convenient,"Best thing about it is that its convenient. It folds up fairly well in your pack, and is super easy to just set it up and leave it. We've only used it once so I don't know how long the filter will keep running since I've read lots of reviews about it slowing down. So we'll see, but so far it worked at a good pace."
4,"Great value, Awesome product!!","Took this on a survival hiking trip in Michigan's U.P. over the summer and it provided everything we needed it to. Very flexible, easy to use, and it's water!! Who doesn't like fresh clear water?!?"
5,Katadyn Base Camp Water Filter,This will save your life get it now and don't go camping with out it. We uses ours all the time and it works great.
4,Best water filter yet,"We recently took a four day trip into the BWCAW in northern MN. This water filter, a birthday gift for my husband, proved to be as easy to use as the advertisement. The video advertisement is deceptive, however, in its portrayal of how to fill the bag. But it was extremely easy to fill from the side of our canoe. We hung it from a tree back at camp and it worked great! It was so easy to use and store and the water was delicious. The only reason I didn't give the bag four stars was that the clean water output was quite slow. But when you're on a camping trip like this, who's in a hurry? We are definitely glad we bought this filter."
1,Returned Twice,"Wish I had a 5-star experience like some others, but alas not the case. Got a slow drizzle from the first unit. Took it to the BWCA for a week anyway thinking it would get better. To make a long story short, had to boil water for the week because we were getting about one drip every 5 seconds. Took it apart to find filter looked brand new...no apparent clogging issues. Returned it and got second one. Followed instructions to a ""t"" and hung it in the bag yard with clean water for the first run. Again, drips, nothing more. It's going back and I'm going back to the pump. Could not be more disappointed. I am an engineer and appreciate the elegant design and quality construction of this unit. Too bad it doesn't work."
2,NOTHING TO DRINK IN GUATEMALA,"Well, here we are in Guatemala, the most populated country in Central America, and we find the filter bag leaks like a sieve. Appears the thread design is faulty and the ""O"" ring is not thick enough to seal the connection and so we are without filtered water. POOR DESIGN. I have contacted KATADYN to see if they have an International solution for us! Be sure and check yours out before camping or traveling and be aware the problem worsens with each use."
1,Not the Katadyn 'CAMP' water filter I was expecting,"I fell in love with their CAMP product several years ago on a group bike trip. Our guide had one and it was fantastic for five of us.After buying I discovered they had changed the filter technology from using a high capacity ceramic filter (Camp model) to a disposable filter with a max life of 200 gal (Base Camp model). Now the product has no more capacity than a personal bottle filter. The fault is mine since 'Features' text is accurate.I give it a low score because it no longer fulfills it purpose as a high capacity camp filter, due to cost and hassle of replacement filters. I would also not recommend for your emergency kit, because of the limited filter capacity.A+ DesignD- CapacityF- Total Cost (filters add up)If you are in Europe, you can still buy the Camp model with the ceramic filter that yields 5,000 gal life.[...]"
5,Great product,A group of seven of us hiked and camped overnight for our first time. My husband was concerned about getting sick from drinking lake water even after it was filtered. The Katadyn Base Camp Water filter bag worked great and no one got sick. We filled the bag using a separate container then hung it from a tree. The bag was filled about three times in a 24 hour period. It was much easier and faster than hand pumping the smaller water filters.
2,unhappy with replacement filters,The katadyn base camp water filter was great the first year we had it. The following year we bought 2 Hiker Pro Replacement Cartridges at $40 each and the katadyn base camp water filter has not worked since. We have tried every thing and are very unhappy. There isn't a number to call or any one to check out the filter. I feel we have wasted over $140 for nothing. Does any one have a suggestion? 7/14/2010 Unhappy!!
2,description discrepancy,"Product description says ""gelcaps."" But look closely at the image. The bottle shown says ""capsules."" And that's what you'll get. If you specifically want gelcaps, don't order this."
5,nicest set cookware ever owned,"Received purchase within five days. The cookware is very nice looking and performs flawlessly on our new induction top stove (unfortunately the stove, Samsung, does not). the best features are: the non stick coating, dishwasher safe, the solid look and feel. I would recommend this cookware to anyone looking for a quality set at a reasonable price."
2,disappointed in circulon pans,"I have had these pans for a year now. They are suppose to be dish washer safe and metal utensil safe. The coating seems to be coming off the bottom of some of my pans and the non stick coating no longer works. My fried eggs stick to my fry pan with sufficient attachment that they can not be turned over easily. As some have noted the handles do get hot. I will be using these pans for sometime to come but they perform only slightly better than my stainless steel set(which I gave away). This is my first set of non stick pans, but if this is as good as it gets, I will go back to stainless on my next purchase."
1,"Nice looking, no quality","After I read all reviews, I decide to order this set. But even with all good reviews, I was profoundly disappointed. After 3 weeks the coating start to come off on the items that was used.Maybe I wasn't lucky to receive a good one, but at this price the quality has to be constant."
2,Haven't been able to try out yet.,"I an excited to give them a try but haven't gotten a set that was good coming out of the box yet. The first set the large skillet had two sides bent in and one of the large covers had a dent in the outside ring. I returned it and received a new set a week or so later and when I unpacked it I checked each piece over when removing it and the second large cover on the top of the box had the handle snapped off. They are refunding my money and I placed another order for the same set, hopefully the third time is a charm. I'm looking forward to giving them a try."
5,Circulon Infinate Pots And Pans,These Circulon Infinate pots and pans were purchased for a Chrisatmas gift. We had been through many sets of non stick pots and pans before but none seemed to last very long. These on the other hand are like none of the rest and far superior in quality. As soon as you pick one up you can feel the difference. We are already looking to add to the set! You won't be dissapointed.
1,Leaks,"Whenever I take the pots out of the dishwasher, they leak.. A lot! The water is coming from the handle. I guess when the pot is in the dishwasher, the handle fills up with water and then can't come out until I pick it up and turn it at an angle to let it run out. These pots cost too much money to have such a defective flaw."
4,so far so good,"We decided to buy the circulon Infinite set because it said that they are dishwasher safe. I have been putting it in the dishwasher, and everything still work very well. The non-stick work very well. The handle does get rather hot, so there could be some improvement here. Now, only time will tell if the dishwasher safe last, it would be heaven if it does!!"
5,Great cookware!,"I bought this after purchasing a smooth top stove.It is perfect, and everything comes out cooked evenly.You do have to use plastic type spoons/spatulas to avoid scratching, but that's ok since they seem to be selling those everywhere now.I've been using this for a year now and it still looks as good as new. Heavy and durable."
4,Cookwaare raspody,I find the collection to be an excellent product. I have no gripe about quality. Price on the otherhand is a bit beyond. I know the Amazon Was the best price on xommon onlinw awecwea.. However Best Buy has the same unit at 25% less price. I am a member of direct buy and should have checked there first. lI Direct Buy will work for you I highly recommend it.
1,"dont buy, save your money",I have had for 8 years and finally got a dishwasher. I put them in and all turned silver. The hard anodized came off. I called and they said oops they are not dishwasher proof. Who has pots and pans you cant use in the dishwasher?? it doesn't say not them not to use dish washer so i'm out hundreds of dollars. Don't make the same mistake i did. Buy someone other. They don't care about their LIFE TIME warrenty...If you do call and talk to Crystal she just laughed and said to have a nice day.So do yourself a favor and buy someone elses pot and pans. maybe their warrenty will actually cover their product.Save you hundreds.Buy someone elses that is made for actual use. Some you dont have to worry about haveing to wash by hand....i dont know about you but im busy and the dishwasher is my savior...
5,Circulon Infinite,"When our old Circulon cookware was mistakenly put in the dishwasher by the housesitter, a replacement needed to be found. I did a thorough search of available brands, with cost not being the most important criteria, and the Circulon Infinite had all the qualities that we were looking for. We have NOT put it in the dishwasher, even though we can. At least we don't have to warn future housesitters that they shouldn't. We loved our old Circulon but this is even better. I love the heavy base, the handles that don't get too hot to touch, the lid that fits so snugly. The handle is comfortable, cleanup is simple. We had considered All Clad/stainless steel, being told that it was the best, but tried one piece and when the egg absolutely stuck to the pan decided that we just didn't want the hassle. I have nothing negative to say about this product and would recommend it highly."
4,Infinite Circulon Works for Me,"After surviving the purchase of this product, which was to include two bonus pieces, and which Amazon made much too confusing and frustrating, I purchased this set and some additional pieces. That being said, this new infinite Circulon does everything I expected. I have a new kitchen with a new induction cooktop and these work great. They are heavier than my previous cookware, but I've had to pass on my previous stainless and aluminum pieces since they don't work with the induction. These heat well, the non-stick is amazing so far, and they have been through the dishwasher. I really do like them. they are everything they are supposed to be."
4,Nice to put in the dishwasher if you can lift it there,"Previous experience with Circulon II was very good. So, Circulon that could be put in the dishwasher was really desirable. However, they are really heavy and the handles get hot."
2,Do not use oil sprays and high heat,"I really enjoyed cooking with all my Infinit Ciculon Cookware. After about 1 1/2 years of use, my 8"" and 10"" frying pans sticking bad. I went to the Circulon website under the FAQs and found""Why are my foods are sticking?"" and read. Do not use spray oils on frying pans because the oils burn on a lower temperature and do not use high heat. If you use spray oils or high heat, you would void your lifetime warranty, Bummer!!! BEFORE YOU BUY, READ THE USE AND CARE, AND Warranty."
4,Nice set of pans,"Cooks evenly, Well made. Little bit pricey, I will have to see how well they hold up. As the other reviews have noted the pans are heavy."
2,Metallic taste,"Large pot gave food (most noticeably pasta) a metallic taste. All other pieces in set fine, but large pot definitely a problem."
5,Great Camera Case,"This is a great case. I bought this camera case for my G2 thinking it would hold the camera and some ""extras"". When I got it I was pleasantly surprised to find that it is fitted to the camera. I probably wouldn't have chosen brown leather but now that I have it, I actually prefer it. It is a very rich color, looks great, and fits perfectly. One great advantage is that it is in two parts. The bottom stays on (screws to the bottom of camera)and you just unsnap the top to take photos. The case does not have to come off to attach the power cord or download to computer [unless you need to take the lens cap off.] I also bought a larger case to hold this camera, cords, speedlite, etc. I would recommend that anyone get both the fitted case and a larger case to keep everything together."
1,Wrong color and not very useful,"The case appears to be black but is actually dark brown, which does not match any colors in the Canon PowerShot G2. The case is purely for protection during travel and gets in the way during photography. A camera bag would be cheaper, providing more padding/protection and storage for extras.The case is in two parts. The lower part screws into the tripod mount. The upper part is held on to the lower with three press studs. There is no storage for extra cards or the remote. The two upper studs can be detached, so that the upper part hangs from the lower stud. However, because the case is very stiff it either covers the lens (if in front) or bumps into your chin. For photography you would need to detatch the upper part, and if traveling you would need a camera bag to put the upper part of the camera case in! So just buy a camera bag."
4,"Handsome, sturdy case if you own the G2","Yes, the case is dark 'chocolate' brown. I actually like it... It actually adds to the ""classic"" look to the case.Yes, the case is in two parts, but this is how standard SLR cameras have been made for years. And contrary to what other are saying, you do not have to 'take one part off and set it aside in order for you to use the camera.' While not recommended during extensive use, you can have the upper part dangle. This is simply how old-style SLR camera cases have been made for years!And yes, accessibility is limited with the case, but I really don't know how they could have made the case be protective without it limiting some of the access. The ports that are available are the power and the PC connection ports.Look, the main reason why I bought this is because I don't want the body of the G2 scratched up, and protected from minor bumps and drops. The case does this fine. And it good looking to boot."
4,"looks great, ok function","This case looks and fits great. I hope Amazon sells this in black. I unknowingl bought a brown from somewhere else (still looks great but it's a bit of a disappointment because silver would look great with black). I am satisfied with this buy overall. A few notes on usage: it's somewhat inconvenient because this thing comes in 2 pieces. so when you take pictures, you'll have to put one piece somewhere else. The piece that is attached to the camera allows you to use the power and other ports/outlets but you'll have to remove it to change the flashcard. i am satisfied over all though."
1,Will not fit G3,"This is a recommended accessory for the G3, but will not fit it. If you order it, you will most likely receive it through J&R; Music World. If you try to return it, they will want you to pay for shipping because of the error on this web page. They will give you a big hassle about it too.Do not order it for the G3. There is another case somewhere called the PSC-3000. It also has no pockets for any cards or accessories. Too bad someone didn't correct this error a long time ago and save people aggrivation. Doesn't anyone ...read these reviews???"
1,It is useless,"It is useless, ordered thought it is a nice complete case to carry all the accessaries, but it is just a case to protect the camera itself. With the case, it is difficult, if not impossible to take pictures."
2,cheap and sad,"The tuning needle is off by almost 1 Mhz making some stations in certan bands unatainable. Knobs and switches feel super cheap and loose. Even though the unit has a light, you cant see what band you are in. This thing is pretty sad.You get what you pay for, get something better."
5,A Must Have for the Serious Cook,"This electric wok was everything I had hoped for and more. It now has a permanent place on top of my stove and I use it almost every day. It was the crowning glory at my recent Chinese New Year party. The 6 quart capacity easily held 2 pounds of Yakitori noodles. With a bit of sesame oil it sauteéd the chicken pieces beautifully.I chose this electric style because I cannot use a traditional wok on a glasstop stove. I was so thrilled with the way the non-stick coating prepared a variety of recipes that I ordered another one to give to my son for his birthday.Finally, cleanup is a total breeze. Aroma Housewares Electric Wok is a pleasure to cook with and a must have for the serious cook."
1,Aroma Electric Wok AEW-305,I read the reviews for this product prior to purchasing it. My mistake was I should have believed the negative reviews. The fist one I received was DOA right out of the box. The second one lasted for 40 days or so and I only used it once or twice a week. The return policy after 30 days is brutal. Warranty from the company is not much better. I would not recommend this wok. I am going to toss the wok and eat the cost!
5,Great Wok,"Heats fast, works great. I like that the cord is connected and I don't have to look for it. I highly recommend -- especially with the price."
3,Good not great,Very nice coating for non stick cooking and well made however the heat control has no temp on it and cannot be removed for washing. This is an ok product if you will use it 1-2 times a month but for regular use spend an extra $20 an step up a little
2,bad product!,"I bought this electric wok on Jan. 22, 2011. It looks nice. However, After three months (April 25, 2011). it doesn't work any more, no power, no heating. I have to through it away. I do not recommend this wok!"
2,Not Recommended.,Made some great fried rice but didn't last very long. I would recommend spending a little more money for a wok with a longer life.
3,Faulty,I purchased this with high hopes and never opened it unfortunately for me until a month later. The top knob came screwed on the inside of the lid and when I attempted to unscrew it the screw broke and is now stuck in the knob and rendered it useless.
4,WOK REVIEW,I am very happy with my Aroma Wok. The only complaint i have is I wish the electrical connection was a plug-in and not a permanent connection. The electrical cord is cumbersome when I clean the wok.
4,WOK,Have only used once. Need paint on temp point setting as its hard to see. Heated very good and even
1,Not good,"1. The wok is not as big as what picture shows. It is relatively shallow. It is difficult for stir fly as the material can be easily stirred out of wok.2. Only a small center portion is hot, and is not even. The hot area is in M shape.3. The thermal dial is kind of not liner. Turning to middle doesn't get you middle temperature. It is more about turning power on and off than adjusting temperature.4. It is broken after being lightly used for 3 months. It can not be returned because return policy expired already.5. I make a good use of it by turning it into a WIFI antenna parabolic reflector. It does look better than aluminum baking tray."
5,Positives Surpass Price!,"Excellent product for the price! I have owned quite a few woks over the years, as well as the top of the line (now dis-continued), and this modestly priced wok is on equal status. It has a large cook surface, heats quickly and evenly, and is a breeze to clean. It will also accommodate the separate vegetable steamer from my now defunct expensive wok. Don't let the modest pricing fool you. This wok scores a definite 10 with me!"
3,NOT SO HOT,"This wok sorta gets the job done. When I attempted a tempura, it never got golden brown.Makes a nice stir fry but the oil doesn't get hot enough. When I checked the tempit barely hit 340 degrees when you need 350-375 degrees. I had an old WEST BEND wok that I used for years and never encountered this problem.If you use it regularly, don't set your expectations very high."
2,good not great,"I had great expectations for this product, reading the reviews and the specifications, I wanted the 1520 so that it would work perfectly for the different type knives. I read the instructions and followed them, and the results were improved edges, however I was expecting razor sharp, what I got was very sharp. A good product but not great. I think I could have bought a sharpener for $100 less and got the same results."
5,Chef's Choice 320 knife sharpener,"I bought this sharpener after trying a friends Chef Choice. I thought the two stage was all I needed and I'm very happy with the purchase. Does a great job sharpening,very fast and easy. I highly recommend this model ands you can't beat the Amazon deal.."
4,Great knife sharpener!,"You must read the instructions and follow them to get the knackof making ""new"" knife blades out of old. It took a bit to get myextremely dull knives sharpened, but now they are fantastic!I sharpened tiny paring knives up to my chinese cleaver and waspleased with the super sharp results.Make sure you allow the blades to align with the magnetic edge,do the passes according to instructions and you won't be sorry.Sorry Amazon doesn't have a better price, I actually found cheaper by $40.00 in Manhattan, still the price is good compared to some of the models I priced out at that big box store on 6th Avenue. My husband can't believe this sharpener delivers the goods without the addition of oil and water during sharpening."
4,Works great after a year,"After a year it is still working great. The amazing thing is my kids use it weekly and the haven't broken it yet.One less star because it is hard to clean around the controls and they are not waterproof.Waffles come out great, no complaints at all."
3,Not Grandma's Waffle Iron!,This unit is ok. I would have preferred an old fashioned waffle maker. The waffles are to thin. I am experimenting with various batter recipes for thicker pancakes.
2,Waffler,"Bought this heart waffler because of it's great reviews. However, the crispy outside and moist on the inside button didn't seem to work any different than the other buttons. Called the company and adjusted settings based on their recommendations but still it didn't work."
3,The rare thin waffle maker,"Pros:-Simple to use.-Makes thin (not Belgian) waffles.-Has been durable.Cons:-Gets dangerously, ridiculously hot in use and well afterwards. Not recommended for kids.-Difficult to clean."
1,Save Your Money,Save your money - ony the left side of the blade got sharp on every knife I tried. Not worth the money or the time.
5,Fantastic product!,"I read all of the reviews for this product and the other two ""Heart"" waffle makers that I was considering, but I went with this product in the end. I wanted the Heart waffle maker because after living in Germany for 3 1/2 years, this was the type of waffle that my kids were accustomed to eating. In fact, I can't tell the difference between the waffles we ate in Germany and the ones that I now make at home. They never stick and the waffle maker never makes a mess. After using it, I wipe it down with soapy water and ""Fertig!""--I am finished. The waffle maker cooks perfect waffles that have to correct thickness and texture. They are not ""thin as crackers"" as one review stated. There was not a chemical smell either. I am very happy with it!"
2,Can't get a knife sharp anymore,"This put a pretty good blade on my kitchen knife set (Calphalon) the first few times I used it. Since then, it seems like it doesn't work at all. I'm using the same recommended technique, but no longer getting any results on my knives."
5,Great Knife Sharpener,I have been the old oil and stone method knife sharpener all my life but I have now discovered that this is the best and quickest way to sharpen knives. Did not take me long to sharpen all the kitchen knives to a very sharp edge. My wife thought I had purchased a new set of knives. I am now collecting all my pocket and hunting knives to sharpen. This is a great product. A lot less messy than the old oil and stone method. Much quicker too. I would recommend this sharpener to anyone who is tired of the old method.
2,Loose Sharpeners,The sharpening disks loosen and vibrate when trying to sharpen a knife blade. This results in uneven results. It happens sporadically. Flaw in the sharpener ? Too expensive for this kind of problem.
1,Open your windows... the smell is awful.,"I have never written a review before but this item is so disappointing that I feel I must.This waffle maker, Chef's Choice 830-SE, does NOT make the Scandinavian type waffles. I'm from Sweden and have eaten plenty of waffles there growing up. This waffle maker makes the waffles as thin as crackers and I would not even call them waffles. The waffle maker cooks them very unevenly no matter the browning setting. There was also no difference between the two cooking modes, the waffle turned out the same.The absolutely worst part is the chemical smell that permeates all through the house when it's on. Horrible. Have had the windows open all evening and it still stinks in here.It's a good looking appliance though... but not usable at all."
5,Exciting Adventure,I thought the novel was fast paced and captivating. I picked up the book and was unable to put it down. The character of Page was well developed. She had many of the characteristics of middle class girls growing up in the suburbs. Page was both vulgar but yet sincere. She was bored with her life and was searching for something better. Like many children she was alienated by her surroundings. She knew her only hope was to get out. The book was well- written and thought provoking and it had many elements of humor. I would recommend this book as a fast exciting read.
3,It is what it is,"The basket and set is pretty much exactly as shown in the picture. Some items are ""flawed"". Some of the plastic plates have black dots (impurities). The inner fabric is held to the basket with fish lines. Some of the lines were not trimmed correctly. But I'll be keeping this as it arrived the day before our picnic and we used it. It functions as it's supposed to. Would I recommend it? If I were to buy this, I would probably want to buy it in a store where I can look at it and know the quality, and probably pay $25-30."
2,Picnic Basket,"We got this picnic basket for our 8-year old who asked Santa for it. She wants to have picnics with her friends in the backyard. It is nice that it comes with all of the items needed for the picnic so we did not have to add anything to it to make th basket functional for her picnics. And we just removed the wine opener. However, there are lots of sharp ends on the wicker part of the basket that we are nipping off so she does not scratch herself, and the twist clasp closure is a little hard to do unless it is in the perfect position."
1,booooring,"I hope these guys aren't from my hometown because they are so marginal, dull, uninspired, unoriginal, Eagles-meet-Huey Lewis hacks that they wouldn't do justice to the city of Burbank. Save your money. The 30 second samples were torture.You have been warned."
1,Too many mistakes,"I am only to page 50 and this book has already completely disappointed me. I cannot even count the number of spelling, grammar, and layout mistakes. The book frequently refers to the incorrect figures, and even when one finds the correct figure, often the command shown in the figure will be different than the text describes! I believe the book is also using the wrong acronyms in some places, so the information may not even be reliable! For someone that does not know AIX well - which should be everyone reading this book - they will be thoroughly confused. Without an AIX machine in front of you, there really is no way to tell when the book is wrong. This is definitely only for the UNIX savvy that can figure the mistakes out."
1,A superficial text replete w/grammatical & spelling errors,"This book was a great disappointment in both its content and presentation. The treatment of most subjects was extremely superficial. Even more surprising was the extent of grammatical and spelling errors, as well as, reference to a non-existent Figure 6-6. Finally, ""defaultly"" is an annoying example of lazy techno-speak and not an appropriate substitute for the phrase ""by default""."
1,Something very important is missing. What is (Aix)?,There may be alot of people that don't know about this and would like to know at least what does A I X stand for without having to spend 30-40 $. Welcome to the world of Aix ( description ) would be nice for starters.
2,Umm..I can barely jump on this thing,"Well, first of all..I'm 13 so I guess I'm probably out of the weight range for these things now..but nonetheless, I still think these dont work very well. For little kids, these shoes help with balancing skills..and I have to admit they're pretty awesome on a trampoline (i did almost sprain my ankle tho). On the ground, though, they're just loud, heavy, shoes that clonk around. I wouldn't really recommend buying these though. They're kind of pointless and will probably end up under a pile of junk in your garage."
1,Total piece of junk,"these seemed like such a good idea and my daughter and her best friend were actually willing to spend their own hard-earned money on them. So we bought them and I spent an hour or so assembling the two pairs. Within an hour we knew they had to go back. First and foremost, the girls were totally disappointed in what they did. Blame the box, it's deceptive, but I was willing to chalk that up to real world education and would have let my daughter deal with the lesson. More disturbing was that we had to replace a half dozen or more of the black rubber bands within that time, they snapped. Now I know why they give you so many, it's not just for the heaviest kids (who proabably are too old for the toy to begin with.) It's so every time the kids use them an adult can spend time putting new bands on...until you run out. Needless to say, they went back the same day."
2,My Son Expected More,"I tried to explain, ignore the advertising on the box, but he was too excited. He is 6 years old and it was a sad moment when he tried to walk around lugging these big hard plasic shoes around. They are very large and hard to manage. They do have a bounce effect but not much fun if the boy just stands there. I would have liked them better if they had a softer/rubber bottom so his efforts wouldn't mare my wood floors. They are now in the closet, we'll try them again next year in hopes he can manage them better."
1,So you want a sprained ankle?,"My son is 9 years old and very angile. he was very excited about these moon shoes. After we prepared the shoes and adjusted the straps to fit his feet, he jumped twice and landed awkward on one foot. The hard plastic bottom tilted over and now he has a hurt ankle. If you have a problem with agility and balance this is not the product to teach it to you. Play with theses at the risk of breaking your ankle!!"
1,Cheaply made and hard to put together...,"Purchased 2 pairs for my 8 & 9 year old daughters for Christmas. The shoes are made of cheap pieces of plastic. The box includes bunches of black, elastic bands that you need to really s-t-r-e-t-c-h onto the shoes to provide the ""bounce"". The more your child weighs, the more bands you use, but you have to double or triple them onto the same hooks. They are very hard to install and could be dangerous if they snap back into your face while you are installing them. Once assembled, the kids played with them for about 10 minutes before becoming bored. They haven't played with them since. Don't waste your money!"
1,Not a good buy,My daughters ages 10 and 8 wanted the moon shoes for 2 yrs. They got them last Christmas and played with them for a few days and in the closet they went for a month or so the next time they wanted to use them the bands started breaking and we replaced then as the broke within 10 minutes all of the replacement bands were broke as well and my children weigh 80 and 60 pounds well within the weight limit. I don't suggest you waste your money on this product...
2,Not as great as I hoped they would be,My daughter just turned seven and we got these for her birthday because she loves to be outside. She thought they were cool for a few days and now they are sitting in the garage. We put the appropriate number of strings on for her weight (56 pounds) but she doesn't seem to bounce very high. And she needs help getting them on. She was upset because some neighbor boys made fun of her due to the fact that they are so big and awkward looking. I wouldn't tell someone not to buy them but I wish I would have gotten something else for her.
1,Accident waiting to happen,"My 7 year old daughter received these for Christmas from a cousin. We immediately returned them. My daughter had no interest, thank goodness, because it would only be a matter of time before she broker her ankle on them. You're better off just buying a real trampoline."
1,No bounce for the buck,These were purchased for my Grandson for Christmas. They are hard to get on. Clumsy and don't have the effect they would have you believe. He never really used them and a waste of money. They were useless and also very dangerous. Defintely would not recommend.
4,good shoes,my 10 year old nephew loved these shoes. they actually work. he bounced all over the place in them and amazingly did not break his neck.
5,Might as well jump!,"Don't let the picture fool you, these shoes DO NOT make you jump as high as the moon. In fact, even the most highly trained athlete wearing these shoes would only be able to jump as high as the clouds.While gravity and shoddy craftsmanship might limit your jumping potential, your imagination will allow you to leap to the stars! That's the best part about Black Moon Shoes -- it's not about how high you can or can't jump -- it's about how high you WANT to jump.So when it comes to using your imagination and developing important motor skills, Hart Enterprises' Black Moon Shoes are leaps and bounds above the competition."
1,Highly disappointed,"As a huge Prince fan, when I first saw these I thought they were PURPLE RAIN shoes, so I purchased four pairs without hesitation. Imagine my dismay when I realized they were some ode to Michael Jackson instead, and were in fact Purple MOON shoes. Very confusing indeed and back they went."
4,Remo djembe stand,"A great product and very affordable. I didn't give it 5 stars only because I wish it was just a little taller. I bought the 10"" head Remo djembe and it is a little lower than the bigger head djembes, so I have to lower my chair to use it. Not a big deal since I have an adjustable chair! All in all, well worth the money. I have a feeling if you bought the 12"" head djembes and larger, that your drum head would be higher up to play"
1,OOPS,I did not receive this work. I got an opera by Bach by mistake. I was never able to correct that mistake. I haven't watched the opera yet.
3,Enjoyable But Ordinary,"I bought this CD because the bandoneon player of Tango 7, Daniel Binelli, once worked with my musical hero Astor Piazzolla and because one of my favorite Piazzolla compositions, Chau Paris, is presented. There is no doubt that Binelli is a fine bandoneonist or that his combo is technically excellent, this CD just lacks the passion I listen for in tango. Piazzolla compositions are among the finest interpretations here: Chau Paris, Picasso and Imperial are all delivered with gusto. In addition, I enjoyed Tango 7's renditions of the classics Los Mareados, El Choclo, and Tanguera. But I am ambivalent about the remainder, thus the three star rating. I like listening to all kinds of tango and if you are a tango fan you'll likely find this CD as I did, enjoyable but ordinary."
3,"Dated, but good","I have the A very Special Christmas 1, 2, and 3. This is my least favorite of the three, but I still like this one a lot. Sinead O'Conner's I Belive in You is very haunting. My favorite tracks are Tom Petty & and Heartbreakers ""Christmas All Over again"" and Jon Bon Jovi's ""Please Come Home for Christmas"". Unfortunately, this CD has tracks by Extreme, Tevin Cambell, and Debbie Gibson, so it feels a little old. But Christmas Music is Christmas music, and if you liked those artists, it won't bother you too much."
5,A Very Special Christmas 2,Never owned this before but has some great Christmas tunes I knew and with the low price for the used CD I bought it.
2,Diappointed,The clock is made of pressed wood. Very flimsy. The clock hands are not protected by a plastic or glass covering. Not really sure what they mean by high definition.
2,Disappointed,"Reading these reviews, I got this book for my daughter.She got very bored with it, and I was disappointed in thelackluster writing. As a college professor, besides beinga mother and a book reviewer, I found that this authorhasn't learned to ""show, not tell."" It looks like this isthe author's first book, so of course there is room forimprovement in the future. I just would pass on this one."
5,Review of K.L.Kings Music,"Karl King was a wonderful composer. He was in the same time period as John Philip Sousa. Perhaps a little different style of composing, but definitely in the same league. This music certainly gets you cranked up and puts a smile on your face. Everyone loves a parade."
3,A fine collection of vintage tunes!,These great marches and rags are a must for the circus collecter. We all can enjoy such marvelous works of music as these.
4,Very pleased,"I love my new hi hats. It took a little while to get used to their sound compared to my old Sabian B8 hi hats (those are good too) but I really like the sound these make, would definitely purchase again and recommend. For this price range, I think these are a great buy."
4,different but better,"I have read the first two of the Mary Russel series before I read this one. I like this one much better. The Mary Russel series is good. However, I can't help feeling that Sherlock Holmes by Conan Doyle is probably NOT as King depicts him. Folly is a stand-alone novel. At first I had my doubts because depression/suicide is not exactly my favorite subject matter. However, the book is absorbing. Despite the fact that I thought I would not be able to empathize with the protagonist at the beginning, I couldn't help becoming interested in her plight as the story unfolded. King is a good story-teller. Much more so in Folly than in the Mary Russel series. She can probably cut some of Desmond's diary entries shorter, however. Philosophizing on fear or solitude or whatever gets a bit boring at times. I found myself skipping over paragraphs of it towards the end."
5,A great book,"A must read. As a fan of King's Mary Russell and Kate Martinelli series I almost went past her latest work. I'm very glad I didn't. It is a powerful glimpse into the fine line between sanity and mania, and into the world of depression that so many of our artists dwell in. Anyone who has had to stuggle with the demons of fear, both internal and external, will relate to King's depiction of Rae Newborn's state of being when she arrives at Folly. And will be equally exhaultant at her victory. The entwined historical and contempory mysteries of the Newborn family was almost secondary to the tale of catharsis they engender."
3,Simply not stellar,"I am not sure how to describe my feelings on this book. On one hand, I liked it. The story keep me listening and wanting to find out the truth. On the other hand, I found it a little hard to get into, and up until about 2/3 of the way through the book, I wondered why I kept listening.There were a few scenes where I felt like the characters involved were contrived simply to resolve someting, but that they didn't really do all that much to move the stor along.I did enjoy the book. I might listen to something else by her, but I simply can't rave about this one.I can tell you that the narrator annoyed the hell out of me. He has a soft ""whispery"" voice that kinda hung on every word, or at the least on the end of every paragraph. At first I considered stopping reading, but then remembered that I actually paid for the book and set my sights on the end. I made it.Not a bad story, just not stellar."
3,I will have to differ with the other readers,"Though the storyline was not bad, I couldn't help but be irritated with the main character. I am not familiar with mentally unstable people but this character is one selfish loser. After endangering her then infant child's life (the first one who is an adult in the story), she actually gets slighted if she has to fight for custody everytime she gets out of her insane stupor. Worse, she grumbles when her daughter and son-in-law took over her finances to pay her bills because she was crazy. It didn't even stop her from hating them when they handed over her checkbook when she got well.She's just a selfish crazy person just like her great uncle who expects everyone to accept them with open arms after the mayhem they caused."
1,Tedious Folly,"I found this whole book to be tedious. If it weren't written by King, I wouldn't have forced myself to get through it. I kept waiting for something REALLY dramatic to happen. Not much did. I guess I will have to wait for another Mary Russell book."
4,One of the earliest and loveliest of the Austen music recordings,"The lovely voice of Juliette Baird, with several other artists, delights in this selection of works taken from Jane Austen's music manuscripts. Music by Handel, Storace, Dibdin and other 18th-century composers performed with style and charm, and with humour when called for. This is a more aesthetically pleasing album than Baird's later 'Jane Austen's Songbook', which is laudable in the completeness with which it includes the contents of one of Austen's songbooks, but suffers a little by the randomness of the arrangement and is not as well recorded."
4,"act 3, i like it more than before","After years, i listened again to act 3. It was amazing to find myself really blown away with the maturity of the composition!They could control the flow and emotion more than their first 2 albums. The sound sounded great too. Without attempting to create a too polished sound, they succesfully brought the energy of their music. I still remember in the beginning of 90's when first time listened to one of their track: Stop. I liked it very much. It was the time when I learned drums. But when I listen to that song now, I like it much more than before, also with the rest fo the songs in the album. Maybe it's because I've been in a thrash band for years. It makes me listen to their music in diferent way. By the way I'm a huge fan of Messhuggah, that's why I like Discontinued too!"
4,"Their best album, excellent production by Max Norman","Although not as hard-core an album as their two previous ones, Act III is worthy aural entertainment for the discriminating headbanger. In my opinion it is their best performance because it sounds like they put their heart and soul into it. Producer Max Norman does an excellent job with their overall sound and balance, but it is somewhat ""over-produced."" Above all, this is their most ""musical performance."" I wish these guys were still around..."
5,Dogs love them,"The dogs love these things, they don't leave little chips all over the floor (like the compressed rawhide), and they're not terribly expensive. Dogs not bothering mom - priceless!!"
2,Poor sorting,I don't believe the company quality controls these raw hides for size or thickness. Some pieces are the expected average size for flat raw hide chews - 8x4 inches. Other pieces are maybe 4x4 inches and very thin and would be very bad to give to larger dogs.
4,One of Stout's best,"""The Mother Hunt"" by Rex Stout really shines with Stout's wiry humor and classic reparte of Archie and Wolfe. A baby is left on a widow's doorstep with the note ""a boy should live in his father's house"". Wolfe and Archie tackle one of the most difficult and complex cases of their careers - finding a father needle in a haystack. Everytime they come close to an answer - another person falls victim to a still unknown killer. With time running out, Wolfe cooks up one of his most ingenious charades - all without the benefit of his beloved Brownstone. A great read - this one you will want on your bookshelves."
1,can never get one delivered that isn't broken,"wouldn't reccommend this item, I've had two shipped both arrived broken beyond use. please use another brand , good luck"
4,solid overview of qualitative techniques,"this book is a good, comprehensive, light-hearted treatment of various techniques available to the qualitative researcher.those looking for in-depth treatment or detailed experiential stories will be disappointed.it provides a good hands-on approach to developing the methods for the personal use of the researcher."
2,Too much for too little,"Although it is a nice product, I recently purchased a silicone whisk for myself (The Cuisipro is a gift)that was a better quality for less than half the price. Live and learn!"
2,No good!,"This thing works great as long as youi have ideal lighting, meaning complete sunlight. I did not expect it to work perfect in the dark, but in a well lit area I would have thought it would at least provide some type of image that you can see. Truth is that unless yoiu have plenty of natural light this thing won't work at all. They should tell you this on the box, but instead they have a picture indicating that it will in fact work in a dark room."
5,A female Jim Croce,"If you like the humor of storytellers like Jim Croce with the strong sultry voice of a Wynona Judd, Carla Ulbrech is someone you just have to hear. I strongly recommend this CD to you."
3,Competent - Not passionate,These recordings present opportunities to hear Handy's work - but I doubt they will inspire others to perform those lesser known tunes.
1,Burning the bridge,"I had seen REO in '96 and I was excited to hear they had a new album coming out. Quickly, I envisioned the Good Ol' REO sound of classic albums like ""Tuna"", ""Nine Lives"", and ""Hi Infidelity"". I couldnt wait to get the new album. However once I listened to ""Building the Bridge"", I was severely dissappointed. Boy, does this album scream suck! I mean, all the songs mesh together in one bland, adult-oriented pop, lackluster effort. Where are the catchy choruses? Where's the fun? Where's the energy? Where's the signature guitar licks? (Oh yeah, thats right...the energy of the Band died when Gary Richrath and Alan Gratzer left).Im not gonna mention the songs because its just a waste of time. Stick with the classic REO."
2,Peace earrings,"These earrings are TINY! Also, the peace sign looks more like a cross...NOT what I was going for. The arms of the peace sign that are suppose to slant down barely do, plus they are a bit rounded instead of straight. Good thing they were only $4."
4,As official as it gets...,"Well, like it says, this book is exactly the same as the online 1.5.2 documentation (which you should be familiar with), just printed out. None of the information is new. If reading the documenation on screen is fine for you there is no reason to buy this book, but if like me, you find having to use up half your screen for a browser window is annoying, you'll find it useful. I gave it four stars because it's so cheap (sure beats printing it all out!)Warning: this is a technical document, not a tutorial. If you're looking for a ""Learn Python the E-Z way"" sort of book you should look elsewhere.Also, this book covers the core of Python - the built-in types and syntax - but _not_ the modules. Anything you have to import to use will not be in here..."
1,useless for me,This was a three page report that wasn't helpful at all to me. Of course I just got apple works and I was looking for some help to get started. Maybe someone who had apple works 5.0 might find something in there useful but I doubt it.
5,Well executed guitar-based acoustic/organic music,"Into The Flow showcases Dan Cunningham's talents as a writer, arranger, performer and interpreter of a wide range of pleasing acoustic stylings. Here, he seamlessly weaves folk, classical, contemporary and meditative songs, ancored by his fluid acoustic guitar playing, and complimented by just the right amount of accompanying instruments. Dan's arrangements are clean and simple, never slick or over-produced, spicing this collection of songs with harp, cello, bass, percussion, humor, and the occasional use of voice. Highly recommended."
5,White Horse Thoughts,I think the book was wonderful. I loved it. When I first read the book I thought it was wonderful. Now when I go to the library I check it out. I love it. It's a beautiful book that's maybe telling a teenager's life right now and I love it and you should too!!!!
1,never worked,"I have to give this television the lowest score possible because it never even worked...either time we got it! It looked like the perfect tv for the under cabinet space in our kitchen - we didn't really need a tv-dvd combo since it's just for me to watch while cooking. But we wanted something sleek and as large as possible but that could fold up under the cabinet. There really are not many choices out there to fit this decription. So many of them have been discontinued by the manufacturers. This one arrived, we set it up and...nothing. The remote didn't work and the tv only picked up a couple channels. We sent it back and Amazon sent us a new one which did basically the same thing as the first. We even checked the batteries with a tester and tried all different cables and wires. Nothing. I wouldn't advise anyone to take a chance on this tv."
4,13 Years and Still Going Strong,"This rice cooker is beyond great. I can't compare it to any others, because it is the first rice cooker I ever had, and I haven't had to replace it yet. My husband's Korean aunt purchased it for us when we first moved in together over 13 years ago. I love the retractable cord, it doesn't take up much room, and the rice is perfect every time. The only reason I rated it a four is because the little container on the side of mine broke about a year ago, and after that it leaked water onto the countertop, which could be a little dangerous. Now I put something on the side to catch the excess water, but I plan on replacing the rice cooker with another Aroma one (only because I would like a stainless steel one to match my decor). Also, it does make 6 cups uncooked rice, but for my family of four that's enough, since it keeps the rice fresh for about a day. We just make more rice, and it doesn't take very long compared to some models my friends are using (ex. Zojirushi)."
1,Misleading label,"This product is clearly mislabeled as a 12 cup rice cooker. It is only a 5.5 cup rice cooker. Rice cookers are typically sold by uncooked cup quantity and not by cooked cup quantity. This product is being advertised as a 12 cup rice cooker, but the 12 cups refer to cooked quantity. If rice is your main dish, then this cooker will hardly feed your family! I am returning this product and am planning to buy a more trusted brand like Panasonic."
3,Not so good as I expected.,"I bought this DVD because I thought it must include Weber's famous invitation to the dance waltz. Unfortunately, it didn't. It included many Latin America music which I really don't like. I'm very disapointed."
4,Afghan/Soviet War: Pakistani General view,"Afghan/Soviet War books can be broken up into a finite set of subjects. Personal/First Person Journalist account, War tactics or High level political/war analysis.This book is squarely in the last category. A view of the war as described by the Pakistani ISI Brigadier General who ran it.Regardless of the fact that the book is very one-sided, biased and self-promotional; I found the book invaluable as a reference on how the Pakistani's ran the war. From Supply chain, US politics, right to on-the-ground tactics; the General goes over everything. At some points admitting Government secrets (That had probably been unclassified by print time).An excellent book, well written, and interesting. The book even reviews at a tactical level, many battles you can read in ""The Other Side of the Mountain"". I would suggest anyone who reads this, also read books written by the Soviets to get an even picture."
5,Everything you ever wanted to know about rings!,"Not only does this book give you the history of this still culturally significant custom of rings and the giving of rings, it delves into the background and techniques of magic rings, including the significance and symbolism of all materials used. Very thorough."
5,Simply Great!!!,"This is a must have for anyone who loves latin music. I am not familiar with Robi Draco but Juan Luis Guerra and Ruben Blades, as always, are amazing. These two traditional artists overwhelm with their lyrics and their music."
5,Outstanding performance,"After hearing Robert Taub featured on Trenton's classical music radio station and hearing him perform at the Institue for Advanced Studies in Princeton, I bought this CD. I have found Taub's eloquence and mastery of Beethoven's Sonatas throughly mezmerizing and I had to get all three volumes. In fact, this collection has become my standard gift to friends who enjouy outstanding classical piano performances.This set is a must have... highly recommended! Also, Robert Taub is a must see if you can get to see him perform."
2,"Not, bad but got old on me fast.","When the band first put out their well polished demo cassette EP called 'Our Stinkin' demo, I was crazy about this band. Their previous 2 albums on Metro One, were great 1990s groove metal feasts. This third self titled one, still has some good heavy moments, but lacks the stamina of the earlier material. I think it's another case of a band that tried to update their sound and it turned around to bite them. I bought it mainly for the sake of collecting it."
1,This Album Is An Abomination,"Don't know what happened after Southpaw, but this album is worse both in style and production. But it only if you need to complete your collection."
3,Fine music - not fantastically performed,"As a previous reviewer commented, Palmer and Brewer recordings are not the best (most are embarrassingly poor/awful) but they do bring some of the finest music ever written to the public ear - so we should at least be grateful for that (even if done abysmally!) Harris is very good, even wonderful in places. Matthews, Hart also very pleasing, pity about the orchestra/conductor, they mar the performers. I don't understand how any professional music recording could feature Lane or Castaldi, they are awful! Worth getting for the music, if you can bear the poor quality of the overall performance."
1,"DO NOT BUY IT, if I may ask","It's a shame. Richard Auldon Clark does not know anything that happened after the dillettantly enthusiast Horst Tanu-Marggraaf. It is not simply a question of gut strings: his group includes ""Manhattan"" in its name, a symbol of the richest and highestly educated people, among whom either one you will not find to buy this debris. Instead, even the inferior other American Händel recordings can be advised for the same money. McGegan, JEG, Hogwood, Christie: they are really experts. RAC is a pompous Niemand."
3,YULE LIKE THIS HOLIDAZE TREAT,"It's beginning to read a lot like Christmas. The publishers spew out the Yuletide titles, and we read them. And sometimes we weep. In the case of Richard Ross' latest, we laughed. Often. This collection of patent applications --- think Santa Claus detectors, singing elves, inflatable snow people and collapsible, pine-scented fake evergreens, smoke alarms in the shape of haloed angels --- proves what happens when the creativity, curiosity, capitalism of idle wanna inventors collide ... perhaps sparked by a generous helping of spiked eggnog. Santa, baby, all we want for Christmas is the tree that sticks out his tongue, patent #US6.053.790."
2,Christmas Patten Book Review,The book was not as good as we thought it sounded when I heard about it on the radio. It would have been better if I could have reviewed its content before buying.
3,Can you say contractual obligation?,"A ""greatest hits plus"" effort from a band with only 3 albums under its belt? Not the way to treat old fans or gain new ones. Four new songs are featured here, but only 1 - ""Days Like These"", stands out. How much better this would have been had the band booked a couple months in the studio and put together 9-10 new efforts, rather than just an album that satisfied only their contractual obligations to Geffen. Sadly, it appears we'll now never know."
4,Great Hits-Plus New Songs,"What can I say besides this is a good hits collection with some new songs thrown in. All the new songs are worth a listen. ""Am I in Love"" is a great ballad. And of course all of the staple hits from the '80s are on here. The only complaint I have was that there should have been more than one song included from the ""Astra"" album. Good hits collection from one of the best bands."
3,Asia Wetton Sampler,"A John Wetton-era sampler of the early 1980's Asia, filled with it's best known hits, (""Heat of the Moment"", ""Only Time Will Tell"", ""Don't Cry"", and ""The Smile Has Left Your Eyes"") and with a great pick-me-up, let's get-the-day-going song, ""Days Like These"". ""Days Like These"" was a huge 1990 rock radio hit that led me refuse to listen to local radio again (our local station wasn't playing it while the rest of the country was). ""Prayin' 4 a Miracle"" is another quality Asia song. The other songs don't quite match the quality of the hits"
2,Nothing Special.,"""Then & Now"" #114 (1990).Then had 5 old songs, Now had 5 new songs. The re-make of ""Voice Of America"", was unnecessary, ""Days Like These"", #2 MSR and #64 hot 100 was a fairly good single. (written by Steve Jones of The Unforgiven a nice little band, that produced a special 1986 release). Just a lackluster release."
4,The 80's group was ASIA,"ASIA was one of my favorite bands from the 80's, this Then (80's) and Now (90's) combine the best era of the band, the John Wetton era, too bad a great song is missing like ""Go"". But if you wanna get the feel of a band born and eclipsed in the 80's buy this CD. The other Greatest Hits(The Very Best of Asia) is better, but with this one you will get the ""basic""(and better) Asia."
3,A Mini Greatest Hits Package with Maxi Problems,"The ""Then"" material is fine with all four of Asia biggest commercial hits (""Heat of the Moment"", ""The Smile Has Left Your Eyes"", ""Only Time Will Tell"" and ""Don't Cry"") and the excellent ""Wildest Dreams"" (featuring a nice Palmer solo in the middle of this song). The ""Now"" side is weak. ""Days Like These"" is fun and energetic. But, ""Prayin' 4 A Miracle"" struggles. ""Am I In Love?"" is too sappy and ""Summer (Can't Last Too Long)"" sounds like Asia trying to immitate A-Ha (Yuck!). And, of all the songs on the ""Astra"" CD to put on this release for the ""Now"" side, Geffen or somebody else picked ""Voice of America"". Why in the world would anybody use this song when they could have used the excellent ""Go"" instead? Don't commit to this CD. Buy the new ""The Very Best of Asia - Heat of the Moment -(1982-1990)"" instead if you want to see how good this group really was in the 80s. Nice cover art though."
3,"Ok, if you don't have other ""oldies"" set.","Songs are mastered well. Nice clear sound and easy to sing to. Sounds like the original background music. You would not be dissatisfied with ""Chartbuster Karaoke"" products. The one flaw with this set is; is that there may be the same songs recorded on these disc, under the same karaoke set title."
2,Disappointed,"I hate to use that term on anything related to Scripture. However, I was disappointed with these songs. Not sure what I expected but this did not meet my needs."
3,DVD defective....,I purchased this combo unit based on reviews I read. My experience in the 3 weeks I've had it is poor. Both the vcr and dvd are loud and the dvd part is defective...After only 3 weeks there are lines across the picture...It is going back! Unfortunately!
2,Barely there.,This is not worth the price. It is not dependable. The picture quality is average at best. The media compartments are flimsy and sluggish in response. Look at other brands. For a few dollars more you can do much better (think Toshiba or Sony).
5,the perfect summer read for you kids,"This is the first chapter book that my girls (6 and 5) actually enjoyed. We spent hours on the grass reading this series and these sessions always ended with ""just one more chapter PLEASE!"" I give it 5 stars!"
1,Boxcar Children overrated,"So many other reviewers of these books have written about how much they love them, and so it feels churlish to offer a dissenting view. But my children couldn't stand the books, and I read them and agree. They're just too preachy. The story isn't compelling, because the books aren't really rooted in story, or in well-drawn characterizations. The kids are so perfect, my kids didn't find them remotely believable. There are so many other much better books for children--I'd recommend almost anything else."
3,Boxcar Children,"From an Elementary student in my class:This book is about 4 children Henry, Jessie, Violet and Benny. They are homeless and looking for a place to find food and shelter. They found a bakery. They got to stay but Jessie heard the baker and his wife talking about making Benny go to a children's home away from his brother and sisters. They ran away from the bakery during the night. In the morning they found themselves sleeping in a haystack!"
3,a review,"I liked this book well enough as a child. My mother read it and then I enjoyed the story. What I don't get is the name of the series. They only lived in a boxcar for the first book, so why are they still called the boxcar children? Will anyone ever let them live down the fact they had to make their home in a boxcar? Geeze."
3,Good book,I think this was a good book because I hate to read so I finished this book in an hour and I loved it!
4,Boxcar children mysteries,"great book with lots mysteries, my daughter loved it and i would recommend to everyone. the book is great reading material for everyone."
5,The best of the series,"3rd grade reader says, ""This book is about four children who keep running away from people after losing both parents during the depression. First, they run away from their grandfather because they picture him as old. They think this means he will only bully them and make them do his chores. Second, they run away from a bakery because they don't trust the baker's wife to not call a foster home, which would allow their grandfather to find them. Finally, they create a safe place to live away from everyone - in an old box car with stuff from a dump. Then they build a friendship with a man and his friend, but the friend turns out to be their grandfater in desquise. They go home with him, bringing the box car with them. This book teaches not to judge people by how they look and how we need a safe place before we can trust."""
5,"Wonderful, even for the little ones!","I read this book to my son as part of our homeschool curriculum for Kindergarten. Every night he has begged me to read one more chapter! He enjoyed listening to this book so much that he would rather pick up his toys than risk missing a night of The Boxcar Children! It was a huge motivator! I highly recommend it. My son has also informed me that when we finish (we read the final chapter tomorrow night), I am to put the book on the shelf and save it so he can read it himself when he's bigger!"
5,The Boxcar Children #1 By Gertrude C. Warner,"Did you ever run away? Well, this story is about four children that ran away from their grandfather. Their names are Henry, Jessie, Violet, and Benny. They ran away because they thought there grandfather did not like them. They found an old boxcar and lived in it. Henry works for a doctor. Will they run out of food? Will their grandfather find them? Find out in The Boxcar Children. Recommended for 3rd graders and up.BySammy"
5,used as part of our homeschooling curriculum for K and 2nd grade,"We read this book as part of our homeschooling curriculum, it's part of our Sonlight Core that we're using. My girls 5 and 7 love this story. We read a chapter per day about 4 days per week and after will talk about the story. I overhear my girls acting out the story with their baby brother who plays ""Benny"".Also a really nice way to talk about children who have lost their parents, and importance of sibling relationships and history, the difference between how the kids lived then and how my kids live now.I might not have chosen to read this if it was not scheduled for us."
3,This book has a great story line that holds kids attention!,"Our class is reading this book and it is very entertaining! The four children are so kind to each other in their attempt to survive alone. I like the humor, especially with Benny and when he cuts Watch's hair! This book is a must read for 2nd and 3rd graders!"
3,"Probably good, but...","...power adapter did not work with either my Sony or my Panasonic portables, so be advised! Others seem to have had luck with other brands."
4,Semi-Great Product,I have one of these ... and it works great. It is the perfect gift for any music fan without alot of money!
5,"I AM THE MUSIC FAN FROM LIBERAL,KANSAS",I LOVED THIS CD. YOU GET SUCH A MESSAGE FROM THE MUSIC. IT I LIKE YOU KNOW WHAT IT FELT LIKE TO BE THERE THROUGH ALL HIS HARD TIMES.
2,Length not as advertised,"This is a very pretty necklace but it is way too long. It is 20 inches, though the ad said 16. I had to pay a jeweler an extra $20 to shorten it 4 inches. I would have preferred to return it, but my husband wanted his mother to keep it. Therefore we ended up paying an extra $20. Would not buy from them again."
1,"Honda manual, not that good","I have a 1982 nighthawk, this book described in great detail the 1970s models but had hardly any info on the updated 80s bikes, manual was not very helpful."
1,Inviting Porches,"This book has a beautiful front cover and several pages of color photos. However, the vast majority of the book is comprised of house plans, many of which that do not have porches other than small stoops. These house plans contain no specific reference to porches, there are no individual porch plans, drawings or elevations. This is a very disappointing book that utterly fails to live up to it's cover...."
5,WOW - Glad I brought it!,"I gotta tell you that I thought long and hard about this product before buying it. I was worry that it was going to sit in my cabinet collecting dust with all of the other stuff I don't use. Not this one, my family loves ice cream (yes, even in the Winter) so I can pretty much say that I use this waffle cone maker at least once a week. I use it more than my toaster. I wish that I can make a large amount of cones and store it but my family prefer it fresh and hot from the cone maker I don't mind because this is very easy to use and clean. So, don't thinking about buying it just get it - you won't regret it."
1,How do I tun the beep off?,"It turns on, it turns off. Making waffles is not rocket science. But the beeping? It never shuts up? It beeps over and over... Make it stop. I'm selling mine because I hate the beep so much. There is nothing wrong with it, makes a decent waffle but gives me a headache on my quiet Sunday mornings."
3,chefs choice 838 waffle cone maker,Nice and compact. Potential buyers should be informed that the product operates on 110 volt network and could not be used on the 220 volt networks of europe or south africa without a step down transformer
5,EVERY LESBIAN SHOULD READ THIS BOOK--IT BRINGS RESULTS!,"I LOVED THE BOOK! FINALLY, a book that addresses an all too common problem within the lesbian community. This book offers SOLUTIONS, RESULTS, and OPTIONS to the dreaded bar scene and lonely Sat. nights to all single and/or lesbian couples. Thank you, Rhona Sacks!"
3,Pretty good,"I bought this along withLesbian Dating: Officially , Maybe, I ThinkIt was pretty good. I liked it.!"
5,An Enlightening Experience,"I decided to read this book because I, like so many of my friends, was just so darn frustrated in the lesbian dating scene. I didn't realize how many of my unsatisfying experiences had to do with me. Ms. Sacks has wonderful insight--she has obviously been there--and great, practical suggestions on meeting like-minded women. I feel better about myself and our community from reading this book. It was a very enlightening experience. I have recommended this book to 4 of my friends, and I recommend it to you."
1,paperback pep-talk,"this book took me about 15 mins to read, and another 15 mins to re-list for sale as used. this is not a collection of methods and techniques for meeting women with similar interests, as the title implies. it is merely an ink-and-paper 'warm fuzzy', full of up-beat exhortations to just keep your chin up, and don't stop trying, girl! at one point, the author suggests that you approach an attractive woman in a bar, and introduce yourself. duh, had that not occurred to anyone before Sacks? if this had been a step-by-step how-to book for building a garage onto your house, it would have gone something like this: ""Get a lot of bricks. Stick them together. Now, pull that car in, girl! Don't worry if a few dozen of 'em hit the hood of your new Volvo. You just keep parking in there, girl! Remind yourself that you have a right to park in there, and don't let that garage make you feel bad for doing it!"" maybe she should have titled it ""Lesbian Dating for Shut-Ins""."
3,BUYER BEWARE,"This thermosotat may be very well suited for Radiators and other convective heating units that offer rapid heating BUT it was NOT designed for and is INEFFECTIVE for use with UNDER-Floor Heating Mats(As Amazon suggests and shows being purchased WTIH . .) Honeywell offers a similar unit - TH115-AF-GA/u - The operative letter being ""F"" for floor sensing. Yes, the unit will send power and warm the floor(as will a light/dimmer switch) albeit far less efficiently than the AF models.So, just becasue OTHERS have bought the unit with a Floor heat system does not mean YOU should. Besides, there is REALLY no point in ordering the EXTRA Floor SENSOR if TH115-A 240 has NO floor sensing capability."
2,Not Accurate,The indicated ambient temperature on this thermostat is 3 to 5 degree's higher than actual ambient temperature. This was compared to two other digital thermometers placed next to thermostat. What happens is when thermostat activates the unit itself starts to warm up from the activation of the relay. This raises the temperature indication on thermostat hence effecting it's accuracy. The thermostat was set for 70 degree's in our living room and the actual temperature was 65 degrees when it shut off. I am returning thermostat and will start to look for something better.
4,Fun Reading,It is a fun book to read. It keeps your attention from page to page. I'm not a big reader of this type of book but I must admit it kept me reading it straight through. I couldn't wait to get back to it. Ya See - I have a PACEMAKER so it was interesting to me.Nice work author.
5,Just listen...,"... I just got done working out to ""Jesse"" and the rest of Dragline. This album was always on my person in college, and still close to my music-mad heart. Apparently others share the feeling. Good....if it weren't just for the unbelievable music, I never would have spied the insert photo of the best pair of jeans I've ever seen... one of my favorite photos ever...sorry I'm just a girl... love it, love it...aaaah!You cannot go wrong if raw, true blue rock is what you seek. Why the hell did A&M; drop them... DAs..."
5,NO RECESS,"Quite simply, this may be the best album I own. It's not for the faint of heart as it is driven by heavy guitar cords and large amounts of whiskey. The only thing better is the live show but for now this will have to suffice."
5,THE WHOLE CD ROCKS,I saw PAW play at bar in Louisville KY one night and couldnt believe my ears. Why are they here? These guys should be playing in arenas with Pearl Jam opening for them nuff said. One of the best CDs ever.
5,"Phenomenal Band! Too bad they got grouped into ""grunge""","This CD is one of my top 10. I like others were turned onto them from the Road Rash soundtrack. They go from every label bidding wildly for them to virtual obscurity. A lot of outlets labeled them as grunge and they soon felt themselves being unsupported by their second release ""Death To Traitors"" which is no longer even available through normal channels. I hope they make a huge comeback but with their lineup recently changing who knows? Every song on this album is a single. My favorites are Jesse, One More Bottle, Couldn't Know,... heck they all rule!"
5,Where in the he-double toothpicks are these guys??!!??,"I felt compelled to write this review after listening to some mp3s of various songs off of Dragline, and being really impressed with the enduring quality of these songs...I used to listen to Dragline religiously in high school, and it became one of the albums I put in rotation when I would isolate myself to produce my artwork (I drew back then- I'm an aspiring filmmaker now)...Just me, some pencils, my Walkman and Dragline. I loved ""Sleeping Bag,"" ""Couldn't Know,"" and ""Lolita"" especially, although it's really difficult to pick a favorite out of such great, emotional and well-crafted songs. That guitar work- OMG! So hot...WHY don't they make rock music like this anymore? It's truly a shame."
5,Super Duper.,"I just had to throw a good 5 stars for this album. These guys have always been good and, having lived in Lawrence and attending KU, the only thing I regret is not attending while they were forming and playing up there! Road Rash forever!"
1,Automobile Traffic in Background,"I've been converting my LPs and cassettes to mp3, and as I was listening to this tape (headphones on) to adjust the input level before recording, I heard what sounds like automobile traffic in the background. It's not noticeable if played over loudspeakers, but disconcerting nonetheless to think that I paid for this. I can almost see someone setting up their microphones near a bridge beside a babbling brook, with trucks rumbling overhead. I've played this tape many times, and never heard the traffic, but I don't believe I will ever play it again. I'm giving this one star only because I can't give it zero stars.If you really want soothing natural sounds, take a listen to the Environments series by Syntonics."
5,The foot notes really help me to understand the Bible,I appreciate when I don't understand something being able to go to the footnotes and get such unique plus valuable information. This book should be for everyone interested in God's Word.
2,Mix of accurate and inaccurate interpretations,Witness Lee is an extremely controversial subject. Much of his interpretation is a mix of scriptural insights and human imagination insights (some very un-scriptural).What is needed is not another interpretation of the Word but how to help all believers interpret the Word for themselves. Relying too much on one persons writings instead of the Holy Spirit cannot be a good thing.
5,The absolutely best Bible available anywhere.,The Recovery Version is the most accurate Bible. Faithful to the original Greek text and to the original thought of the writers. The Recovery Version is the clearest and also very easy to understand in its flow. It also has those Notes! The Notes are pure gold. Any verse in any book can be opened up to the reader like never before. The cross-references and the outlines are also extremely useful. The is no better Bible available.
5,WHAT IS LIVING ALL ABOUT???,I found through the recovery version the secret to the universe! God has soo much to reveal to us and I thank Him that He provided me with the recovery version to ACCURATELY communicate it to me. On several occasions this word has proved itself to me. It also is a source of freshness and life. It is THE BEST WAY to find the living Christ in His Word.
4,stork oin,"I liked this item. i need sixteen more words before i can submit htis. now six, now four, now two"
4,Great camera for the price,"I moved up to this camera from a Fuji Finepix 2.1 MP camera that I had for a year. Was very happy with the old one, but wanted to be able to do enlargments. Gave the old one to the kids and bought an E550. It takes great pictures and has lots of manual features that even a relatively novice photographer like me can figure out. The only complaint I have is that you have to manually click open the flash or it will take the picture without it."
4,Nice origami book,"This book contains a collection of fifteen original origami models by John Montroll. They are really for the intermediate level paperfolder who has mastered the techniques of inside and outside reverse folds along with some squashing and collapsing techniques and who can fold reasonably accurately.There are no photographs of finished models, but the computerised diagrams are clear and the models are attractive when made up. This would make a nice gift and anyone who enjoys Montroll's work will like the book."
3,Park Ave Alternator,"Received item in a timely fashion. However, I was only able to get two out of three bolts to line up on the alternator. It is installed and does work but it is definitely a sub standard replacement part."
4,Great tie,"This tie is a perfect match to our wedding colors, out little guy is going to look great! Great quality and price"
1,Not satisfied. Never received my product.,I can't write a reveiw of the product since I never received it. I have submitted 3 emails inquiring about it and haven't even received a response. I am totally unhappy with this experience. I would still like to receive the tie I ordered. It's needed for a wedding very soon.
3,Quaint but absorbing,"M. Gobillot is a famous barrister in Paris. He has a beautiful wife who has helped him fashion his career and now, a twenty year-old mistress. In 2008, some fifty years after this book was published, the outcome crackles with misogyny and for those of us of a certain age, is perfectly predictable.Simenon was well-known as a libertine so it's no surprise that the lawyer enjoys his mistress-and occasionally his mistress' girlfriend as well-and at the end, the inconvenient young thing ends up dead.What redeems this book is the hero-narrator whose utterly unsentimental take on himself matches his almost bloodless telling of his feelings for wife and mistress. The coolness of this storyteller reminds us of a certain vogue in the fiction of the years after ww2. For many of us, our reaction to the narrator will be a mark of how far we've come.Lynn Hoffman, author of bang BANG"
1,"When did spouse abuse become a ""Romance""?","This is the unlikely story of a hapless young woman abused by both her father and the course, ignorant man she was forced to marry. Their story starts out with the usual light conflict that is expected in Romance novels, but drags the reader throughthe heroine's endless humiliations and physical abuse because of her husband's very heavy-handed manner. There is no pleasure to see a young woman cowering at every turn, but is it especially repulsive to see her accepting this abuse as her fault, and still trying to please this beast. There is far too much spousal abuse in our culture, and to read a ""Romance"" where such brutality is condoned is very upsetting."
3,Two books with the same title,"I do believe we have a mix up here. When I pull up reviews for Amanda Scott's book ""Border Bride"" the info that comes up is about a book written by Arnette Lamb that is also called the ""Border Bride"". I can see why the confusion since both books have the same title. Amazon.com is showing the cover of Amanda's Scott's book but posting the reviews from Arnette Lamb's book. I don't think this will make either author very happy and is confusing to readers."
4,The song My Way alone makes this a great CD.,"This CD is not especially packed with to many of Sinatra's greatest hits yet this is a powerful CD. Of course the CD is made perfect just by the title song ""My Way"". I would recommend this CD to anyone who enjoys great music from a great performer."
3,Frank Sinatra - My Way Review,"Believe it or not, This is not one of Frank's better records and Im the biggest Sinatra fan in the world.This record is o.k. but its Frank so if your a fan you have to buy it."
4,A mixed and modern album - barely 4 stars,"There are some great cuts on here: My Way, A Day in the life of a fool, If you go away and ALL MY TOMORROWS and of course FOR ONCE IN MY LIFE - one of Frank's staples in concert from 69-95.The rest of the songs are fair at times Frank's singing sounds a bit lackluster and cold (e.g. Watch what happens). This may also be due to the extreme amount of reverb on his voice and the fact that on some songs he's in dead center in the mix. He sounds warmer on most of the ballads.This album was co-produced by Costa and Sonny Burke and I still think Costa was the better producer."
3,Gotta Love Frank,As a person who got their start in radio as a board op for the Sounds of Sinatra on Sunday mornings....I have to say...Frank's version of Mrs. Robinson is truly like no other. Only Frank could sing Mrs. Robinson this way and still have it sell a zillion (and one) copies. I've developed a fondness for Frank over the years....which makes me able to tolerate his version of that particular song. I am just glad that he and William Shatner never decided to team up for an LP of (very interesting versions...of previously very popular) cover songs. This would not be one of my fave Frank LPs. I prefer Frank's classics.
3,"A mixed bag, but some greats from the Chairman...","Sinatra sounds like he's in great voice on this album, and there are some good tracks -- My Way is wonderful, All My Tomorrows is also treasureable and he generally makes more of the music than it is worth on its own. Didn't We is a good example, beautifully performed but not much of a song lyrically or musically.Yesterday isn't bad, Mrs. Robinson is just awful. Not the first Sinatra album you should buy, but overall very listenable (just skip the last track)."
3,Only suitable for very small rooms,"I wish they've an estimated warm up space on the product info. I got this until about a month ago and I first tried it in my living room. With maximum heat (claimed to be 1500W), I can feel no different in temperature. So, I moved it into my bed room, which is about 100 - 150sq ft, and I had the heater on all night in maximum and door closed. When I woke up in the morning, I don't feel warm at all. The temperature between my bed room and living room is about the same. It's kind of useless IMO. Or, maybe my unit has problem? The fins do heat up but not very hot. Only good enough to warm my hands and feet.P.S. I live in California, so it's not even extremely cold to start with."
1,Poor Quality- 2 Dead in 18 months,"The first one arrived leaking oil. After struggling with the Warranty Dept. at Soleus, they finally sent a replacement. The replacement lasted about 18 months before the electronics burned out. I could smell and see arcing in the unit. Of course they won't replace the 2nd one as it is ""out of warranty"". Buy the Delonghi, I have one of those for over 2 years with no problems."
3,Takes too long to heat up..,"But I guess that's how oil filled heaters work. Does not really heat the entire room, but it's cozy to have it near you."
4,Some of these stories stayed with me,"I read this about forty years ago, but found some of the stories so haunting that I bought a used copy and re-read it. The particular standout is ""Wolves Don't Cry"" by Bruce Elliott, about a wolf who wakes up to find that he has turned into a man. I also liked ""The Story of Sidi Nonman"" a sort of Arabian Nights-like tale that is anonymous. There were a couple others that I didn't like so much, but all are competent stories.Contents:,Introduction, by Rod SerlingThe Amulet, by Gordon R. DicksonThe story of Sidi Nonman, AnonymousThe Final Ingredient, by Jack SharekyBlind Alley, by Malcolm JamesonYoung Goodman Brown, by Nathaniel HawthorneThe Chestnut Beads, by Jane RobertsHatchery of Dreams, by Fritz LeiberThe Mark of the Beast, by Rudyard KiplingAnd Not Quite Human, by Joe L. HensleyWolves Don't Cry, by Bruce ElliottThe Black Retriever, by Charles G. FinneyWitch Trials and the Law, by Charles Mackay"
1,Burned on someone's home computer,"It's a burned CD, which was not in the advertisement when I bought it."
1,Where are the speeches???,You would think thst this DVD would actually have the speech for JFK's inauguration. All it really is is an old news clip you would see in a movie theatre in the 50's with narration talking over it. Home made...dont buy!
5,President Kennedy was eloquent and a real Public figure.,I met President Kennedy in Santa Monica. what a thrill that was. The year was 1962 and he and his brother had saved America and the world from experiencing a nuclear exchange with Russia. I shook his hand twice. Once on land and once in the Pacific Ocean. Thats a story for another day. He exuded kindness and sincerity.Listen to his voice as he speaks and jokes about politics. Hear Ye Hear Ye.Remember him well. He belonged to all of us. His voice is soothing.
4,great little movie,"Lots of great characters and very entertaining. Philip Seymour Hoffman is fantastic as Joey's assistant who gets a chance to show off the talent that has made him a star now. Gina Gershon one of the hottest women ever in moies, Erik King late of the tv show Dexter and especially Richard Edson as the titled character all shine. I remember seeing this movie years ago and really wish they would put it out on dvd. A agent learns that living life is much more inportant than just making money. He turns from a homophobbe to a caring memebr of the world. Great show."
2,Good Information--Bad Judgements,"Although this book is full of great photos, interesting information about the plants and the worlds where they come from, the authors are clearly more interested in exploiting the knowledge of the natives than attempting to appreciate the unique tribes, their customs AND the plants they use. This book should be called ""The Plants We Can Take from Less Advanced People Than Ourselves""."
2,Unnecessary,"The only songs on this album that aren't on Big Ones or O Yeah! Ultimate Aerosmith Hits are some live and/or acoustic versions. They only have ""Dream On"" and ""Sweet Emotion"" as live, but don't have the original recordings. They also have a dumb acoustic version of ""Livin On The Edge."" No original for that either. People complain that O Yeah! is missing some essential songs such as ""Train Kept A Rollin',"" well this does not have it either. They have many of their hits, but there is no reason to get this. If you want a greatest hits collection get O Yeah! or Big Ones. If you are looking for live tracks get Classics Live or Live Bootleg. Stay away from this unless you are turned on by the jewel case cover."
2,Who is this for?,"For whom exactly is this double-disc set intended? Is it a hits compilation for casual fans who don't want to delve into the albums? Well, seeing as Geffen only owned the band during the second stage of their career, it couldn't be definitive, and the single-disc best-of ""Big Ones"" covered the Geffen years quite nicely already. Is it a rarities collection? There are quite a few b-sides and previously unreleased tunes here, but it's mostly re-packaged material from their Geffen albums. Even the live tunes are straight from their recent live record, A Little South of Sanity. So the hardcore fans will have to have it, even if their paying mostly for material they already own - and a few casual fans might pick it up confusing it for a greatest hits collection. Still, it's little more than another contractual obligation of marginal value."
1,Rip-Off!!!!,"My son is really in to making a comic book and his favorite comic characters are Marvel. I thought this would be great for him, but it is very hard to use and very, very limited in the use of the Marvel characters. You only get one limited group of templates. For instance, Spiderman leaping from a building and no other frames of him. Kind of hard to create a spiderman comic with on pose! I am seriously looking in to getting my money back.Marvel Heroes Comic Book Creator"
3,Too Narrow,I was so excited about recieving my shoes because they would go perfectly with a dress I had just gotten. As soon as I took them out of the box I saw how narrow they were. I tried them on anyway and of course my foot would not go in all the way. Otherwise very pretty looking shoe.
1,Not worth it,"I purchased this product to steam my Borsalino hats. After 5 uses, it stopped steaming. Rowenta told me to put water in it and hold it upside down and press the steamer button 4-5 times. I tossed it in the garbage. Extremely disappointed. Sure I could have sent it in for repair, but that would have cost more that the amount I paid for it originally."
3,Just OK,"Maybe I was expecting too much... Trying it on hanging garments, it does lessen the severity of wrinkles, but only the lightest wrinkles disapeared completely. I liked that I could use regular tap water, ...especially because I used at least one handle-full per shirt. (the removable tank is in the handle). It irons as well as any standard iron, but the shape of the handle makes it more difficult to handle than the usual shaped irons. (One might get used to it with practice) If I want clothes that look pressed, I think I will have to go back to a regular iron and board, and do the work of actually pressing them. I have no experience with professional steamers, and do not know if they would do a better job."
3,Problems with suppliers,"As I have a problem with a broken part, ROWENTA NEVER; NEVER answerd my requestn and then, I bougth a new one to replace the broken one.So the problem is not the DA-75 Steam, but ROWENTA has not post customer service."
4,Great for travel and light steaming,I have owned this iron for about three years now and I use it every week still. It is great for quick steaming of sweaters and quick ironing in the morning. Not great for stubborn wrinkles or delicate fabrics but that is not what its true purpose is. It is wonderful to throw in your suitcase for traveling. Just remember to keep cleaner on hand and clean it regularly.I recommend this iron for any business traveler!
2,Will BURN you when using VERTICAL Steam,"when using vertical steam against hanging clothing, the steam will push out underneath and blow towards your hand underneath the handle. Its HOT!You also have to press the button every time you want steam. It takes for ever to steam a regular hanging cotton dress shirt.water reservoir is very small, only the size of handle.would not recommend. I need a iron that will steam continuously an hanging article, without a board. gluck"
2,Look For Something Else,"I picked this up used at a thrift store for $10 and I can see why it's no longer in production. It's more of a hand held mini iron than a steamer. When hitting the steam button, steam spits out erratically (leaving wet spots on clothes) and water drips down the handle (kinda putting the user at risk for electrocution). If you remove the plastic brush cover (to use the sole plate for ironing), you have the let the unit rest on its side. The container which holds the water is too small. It might be good as a touch up iron but I wouldn't recommend to anyone to buy this unit."
1,Where's the steam?,"An unfortunate purchase. I have had much the same experience that many other reviewers have had with this steam iron. I wanted it for steaming clothing which cannot be easily ironed. I was thrilled to find a reputable brand at a reasonable price. I was disappointed from the start. The first one I brought home, didn't work; no heat, no steam, nothing at all. I re-read all the instructions and tried again. Nothing doing. I returned it for a replacement; same results. Don't bother buying one."
4,Works great but it's big,The steamer/iron works great but it takes some serious space in your luggage.
2,Nothing like Rowenta irons,"A friend of mine has a steamer that she loves and says she never irons anymore. She must have a much better steamer than this one! I chose a Rowenta steamer because I love their irons, but...It's very poorly designed in all ways. It takes 2-3 reservoirs of water to get the wrinkles out of one shirt. Plus you have to contantly hold down the steam button, which will have your hand cramping in no time.I'm taking it back to the store :("
1,VERY poor quality,"Boy do I wish I'd read the reviews here before we purchased our Rowenta steam iron! Like many others, ours never worked properly: 1. The brush attachment broke right away (should have returned it then, but we just accepted it and continued to use it), 2. It constantly leaked water over our clothes, floor, selves when in use, 3. It was always REALLY DIFFICULT to get it to steam, requiring repeated, fast presses of the button until our thumbs were sore, 4. It finally just died today--stopped working for no reason. For such a simple product as an iron to break after just a short time, you know the quality is POOR. BEWARE OF THIS PRODUCT and, by association, THIS BRAND. We will certainly never buy a Rowenta again!"
1,Rowenta Steamer,"I am so glad that I reviewed your customer comments. I purchased the Rowenta Steamer for my sister a litle over a year ago at a fabric store.The steamer never worked properly, (could not get steam to come out of appliance ) and we thought it was just a ""lemon""She contacted customer service at Rowenta and they wee not onlynot helpful but rude. They would not replace the steamer since she didnlt have the sales slip; although they had a record of a her phone call right after it was purchased.Rowenta is certainly not customer or service oriented.After eading reviews; I will purchase another brand for her.Thank YOu"
4,"THE WINNING TOUCH, a game to practice times tables","We had this game for our kids in the 1970s, and I was very disappointed in the quality of the current offering, however, it provides the same practice opportunities, and if played with the child who needs practice, is very engaging."
4,Orchestra sounds good especially...,"the Apotheosis. Played at the right tempo. Big sound. Right use of percussion, AND four distinct downbeats at the end. Well done !!"
1,Captain Planet review,"This show and the episode stinks. The Villains are very repetitive with sterotypical names. The Wheeler guy is annoying and the rest have little to no personality. The show itself is preachy and hammers the same message over & over again like a broken record. B.T.W: how can you start a fire just by lifting your ring and saying ""fire"" and what's the deal with Ma-Ti's ring of Heart? Do they ever explain how it works and why it works on humans & animals? I give this tape a 1 out of 10."
3,has its moments,"As a whole these cd's are not Seb's best work. But if you like the 'commercial' sound of Oakie then you will love it. He has definately replaced a lot of his regular funk and edge for some atmosphere and POPie baselines. The standouts on cd1 are ""Tweakin"", and Saeed and Palash's ""Champion ""which by the way is a bangin track. Cd2's standouts are #4 ""wrong"" and #5 ""Lexicon"".As always Seb's mixing is utterly flawless, i would almost say that all of his cd's are laid out by a computer if i haden't seen him spin personally. Definately has its funky and 'chunky' moments but not often. I know that all artist have to move foreward or get left behind but we have enuf Oakies in the world."
5,disapointed,misrepresented to be an up to date Almanac for 2012 when it is 6 years old.This is a yearly publication for Military personnel. Money should be refunded.
5,Good manual,"This Retired Military Almanac is a good reference manual. But, just try and actually get the benefits; forget it. Just like the Government. They always brag about your potential benefits which are always just out of reach."
4,"""Retired Military Almanac,"" by Debra M. Gordon.",This is the version for retired military personnel of the old faithful annual for active duty military. It contains a wealth of useful information in a handy-to-use format.
4,Love the story & Doris Day's lounge singer character.,"Doris Day's wise cracking, slang speaking character is such a different role than is usually associated with her, but no less adorable. ""Romance"" is filled with classic Hollywood cheese, rapidly fired one liners and quirky people doing quirky things. The exotic places where the cruise ship stops are a fun escape from the norm, and are populated with stereotypes that reflect the average unseasoned traveler's attitudes towards tropical locations at the time of filming. Although, I feel that only adds to the film's charms as it is essentially an escape into a different world for the average 1940s American. The character actors throughout the film are a snapshot of things as they were before unapologetic stunt casting removed these types of artists from mainstream work. A breezy classic romantic comedy where no amount of mishaps and misadventures can keep the main characters from being happy in the end."
5,a delight to watch,"This film is sheer delight from start to end. I am glad to own this film with Doris Day in her first film.If you like musicals, add this gem to your collection.Doris takes the place of another person who wishes to snoop on her husband. Meanwhile the husband does the same thing, the resuts is pure comedy. Just watch it, you will no go wrong."
5,Her Best!,"I love Doris Day, but I think this is her best movie. And I love Oscar Levant; I think his dry sense of humor is wonderful."
5,Great!,"This was my first Hiatt CD. Of course, I'd heard him before (Pink Bedroom, etc.), but hadn't paid him much attention. This one blew me away. ""Old Habits"" and ""Permanent Hurt"" are the favorites. The guitar bridge on ""Old Habits"" was one of the best licks I heard when I first got the CD. Again, one of the best of the 90's."
5,A desert-island disc for me...,"One of my favorite CDs of all time. I can listen to it again and again (and I had never listened to John Hiatt before). Buffalo River Home pulled me in, and I slowly grew to love every song on the album. Highly recommended"
5,Excellent album.,"You can listen to Perfectly Good Guitar all of the way through, every song, not skipping a one. Something Wild, Straight Outta Time, Perfectly Good Guitar, Buffalo River Home, Angel, Wreck of the Barbie Ferrari, When You Hold Me Tight, Permanent Hurt, Loving a Hurricane, are all rockin'. The mmm-mmm-mmm at the beginning of Old Habits is just sensual, leading you into a strip-it-bare stolidly mournful song. This album is one of his best."
2,Entertaining but Flawed,"This book has nice pictures of Arlo, Alice, and the church, but it unfortunately also has some serious flaws. Lee makes a few odd claims about Arlo Guthrie, the strangest being that his draft status was really 1-A. According to Lee, ""The truth is he was not disqualified for the draft at all. His number simply never came up."" (p. 102) I'd like to see Lee's source for this, but since she didn't footnote anything I have no idea where she got this information. Arlo Guthrie, in his commentary to the 35th Anniversary DVD of Alice's Restaurant, says that Lee is wrong: the army called him back several times and ultimately told him they didn't want him. Given Guthrie's denial, Lee's lack of evidence, and the general behavior of the US military in 1966 towards anyone classified A-1, I don't believe Lee. The book is entertaining, but I'd take it with more than a few grains of salt."
3,"Passable, but left alot to be desired.","Being a fan of Bonobos, I was sorely disappointed with the Gear's book. The writing was two-dimensional starting with a head to toe description of all the characters as they appeared, and ending with a decided LACK of scientific information, which surprised me. Nothing was mentioned of matriarchal, sexually open Bonobo society being far more peaceful than Pan Troglodytes', or even of the differences between the two types of chimps at a basic level. No explanation was given as to ""how"" they genetically altered the chimps, other than vague references of blue eyed mother chimps nursing babies and conversing in AMESLAN. All in all, it was flat. Passable as brain candy if there's nothing else to do."
4,Good story line,"U.S. scientists try to raise bonobo chimpanzees in their homes - very intelligent, genetically engineered chimpanzees. The smartest is Umber, who shows intelligent that of a human being. When the truth comes out why Umber is so intelligent, she, along with her caretakers, is send to Africa to a specially prepared fascility, where the secrets are being held. What the scientists don't realize is that there are very dark horrors awaiting them there - horros created by humans themselves. Original and entertaining."
5,Wonderfully Thrilling!,"I bought this book mostly as an after-thought, never having read any of Gear's work before. It was more curiosity on my part more than anything. But I'm so glad I did! I enjoyed it thoroughly and look forward to more just like it!"
3,Good,"Interesting story. Good character development as is typical with both of the Gears. HOWEVER, the editor needed some time off before reviewing this one."
5,Duet Heaven,"I defy you to find a more beautiful duet than Aaron & Linda's Song Of Bernadette, this hauntingly beautiful ballad has been around for quite a while now, but it is only through these magnificent vocalists that it has become a musical masterpiece. I think it's about time a compilation CD of their duets was made available."
5,Fantastic CD!,"If you like Aaron Neville, you should buy this CD. It is terrific. He has the voice of an Angel, and does not disappoint for a second!!!Melody"
4,"""SOUL..NEW ORLEANS STYLE""","NOT REALLY A HUGE FAN OF AARON NEVILLE..HOWEVER..THIS ONE WAS WORTH GETTING BECAUSE IT HAS SEVERAL TRACKS SUCH AS ""BROTHER MY BROTHER"", THE BELLS,ETC..DONE IN A WAY THAT ONLY AARON NEVILLE CAN DO..JUST FUNKY AND BLUESY ENOUGH TO BE WORTH THE PURCHASE..WOULD RECOMMEND AS A ""CHANGE OF PACE"" ITEM!"
5,can't find the words,Bishop Jakes is truly a man of god the best way I could explain it is he's what the glory of god looks like in the flesh. This 6-pack dvd is inspirational it will change your life if you act out the sermon. Women and men should buy this dvd-package. God Bless
1,A collectors book...not very useful for shooter,"The content of the book is overly personalized to the author and contains little information useful to the average 10/22 shooter. The book reads as if the author is writing for himself rather than for the reader; the most commonly used word being ""I"". Collectors may find some valuable information though the presentation makes the book a below average and boring read. There is a copy of the original 10/22 patent, which is interesting, and some ""blow up"" shots showing the firearm parts and assembly in detail. These are the only pluses in the book but can be found in other 10/22 manuals which are much better written than this book. In short, if one is looking for a little history, and some collector information on the Ruger 10/22, this might be a book to consider. If one is a shooter looking for details on how to use, repair or modify this firearm, look elsewhere."
3,Disappointed on Video Cd's,"This book is providing necessary information about the basics of Asp. I tought the video cd's coming within the book are hands on training but I have to admit that I am a bit disappointed. Cd's are not useful but they are full of unnecessary talking. Far from a tutorial. For its high price, the book doesn't worth to purchase."
1,ASP Fundamentals - Not worth the money,"THis isn't even a real book. The book is actually a power point presentation taken to kinko's to be copied and bound. You might think that all the money you paid went into making a really cool learning tool (the Video CD)... but the video lessons are unprofessionally done... very generic, not helpful... All together the lessons are only 1.5 hours long, most of which could have been condensed into 30 minutes. I would not recommend this book, even as a joke!"
2,"Sean Costello, my review from Barcelona","I am a fan of Sean Costello and I own several of his previous albums like ""Call the cops"" or ""Moanin' for molasses"", that I rate with 4 or 5 star. However this one, for some reason that I cannot understand, is not a blues album, only a hint of blues put in a sort of soul-pop-rock dish. If you're expecting something in line with the works mentioned above, I strongly recommend, as M. Bernocchi does, to give this CD a listening before buying it. Soul - pop audience might love this album, but for a blues purist like me it falls short of my expectations. When Sean plays blues is really such a big pleasure that I hope he will come back playing true blues very soon.This album is a mixed bag. The tunes ""Take it easy"" and ""Peace of mind"" are very good in my opinion but not the expected Blues."
4,This album works,"How can anyone be disappointed with this Sean Costello offering? Is it traditional blues? No. But the blues has different sounds and form and this CD, with its up-beat tone, tough chops by Costello, pounding drum rhythm, works ... and works well. The blues don't need to be sad, they can make you want to dance, too. You'll bop your head up and down to this CD and mimic a bass player or a drummer if you like. It's catchy and fun. C'mon guys, lighten up. Clapton, Costello ain't. Why would anyone put the two in the same sentence? He's Sean Costello not trying to be anything but. Give it a whirl, it's good music, done good."
5,a great addition to any stitcher's collection,"I love to cross-stitch, yet I have trouble finding patterns that interest me. This book is such a wonderful find. It has a wide variety of patterns (the Klimt doesn't look anything like the Tiffanys on the cover) which are challenging enough for a stitcher who likes a more intricate pattern (like myself.) The patterns in this book are some of the best I've ever seen as far as artistry goes. The small motifs and decorative borders included at the back of the book encourage us to use our own creativity. I can't wait to make more of the projects in this book - right now I'm working on a pillow with one of the decorative borders."
5,The man behind the voices,"He's not as well known as Mel Blanc, but should be. Daws Butler was the voice of Yogi Bear, Huck Hound, Elroy Jetson, Mr.Jinx, Quick Draw McGraw (and don't you fer-get it!) and Snagglepuss in the classic Hanna-Barbera cartoons. He alsoworked with the legendary Stan Freberg (from ""Time ForBeany"" to his radio shows and records). Toward the end ofhis life, he served as mentor to the likes of Nancy Cartwright(voice of Bart Simpson) and Dr. Demento's co-hort WhimsicalWill.This is an enjoyable read for fans of cartoons and old timeradio. Ohmart and Beliacqua show us the man behind the voices, both at work and at home. Heavens to Murgatroyd!"
4,A Loving Tribute to a GREAT Talent,"Daws Butler was the best of the best, right up there with Mel Blanc and Paul Frees. I am prejudiced as he was a friend of mine (My name appears twice in this book, grossly mispelled both times.), but he was the greatest. When he died, it took over 30 actors to replace him. This book, written by a friend and student of Daws, while hardly literary, is a well-researched labor of love, and a fine tribute to one of the nicest men ever to be the very best at what he did. If you loved Beany, or Huckleberry Hound, or Yogi Bear, Captain Crunch, or the classic Stan Freberg recordings, you'll find the story of the man behind the voices to be a terrific read. If you weren't privelged to know Daws, this book is as close as you can come now to a visit with this kind, wise man."
2,Don't Bother,"Poorly written, with so-so layout ideas. It was just plain hokie! Got this at the same time I got ""Scrapbook Storytelling"" by Joanna Campbell Slan. The latter book is FAR superior and very well written. If you really want quality journaling in your scrapbooks, get ""Scrapbook Storytelling"" NOT ""The Art of Scrapbook Stories."""
3,it's whatever,"Filter hogs up much of the bottle, and takes quite a bit of effort squeeze.. not ideal for when you're tired and dying for a drop of water. I also think the nozzle technology is dated, and check out the costs of the filter. It's only good after one trip."
4,nice product,Works well and instructions are clear. Make sure you follow the instructions before using the first time. A little smaller volume than I thought. The filter takes up a good amount of space inside the bottle.
2,Not your best option.,"Okay, the Zvue seemed like a good buy at the time. But it was not. It only came with a 125mb card wich can only hold like 25 songs. I wanted it to have a 4gb memory, so i went to the store and it costs 50 dollars or more for one. So it would be much easier to just buy another mp3 player (at the same price as the Zvue with a 4gb memory card[total of about 180 dollars or so]) at the same price and get 8gb or more and you could probably get a better video player on that mp3. So its much easier to buy a Zune or even an ipod. But i must say that it does have great sound and two headphone docks so you can listen with a friend. But the flaws outweigh the good."
4,Zunie video,Great little gadget for video on the go. Easy transfer from desktop to the device. Good website to download videos from.
2,Very Short Introductory Guide for ERP,"This book has very short chapters that cover ERP in introductory terms. It's an alternative to reading a 50-page article over the Internet, for example. Nothing is covered in depth and the information is not going to raise one to the level of either being conversant on the subject of ERP or give one tools to make a buying decision.Whenever I get a book like this, which only happens by accident, I always try to discern the motivation of the author. Who was the author writing this for? Of course, since I don't know, I speculate. I hope it's appropriate to speculate here on an Amazon review. My speculation is that this author wrote this book to enhance his career. That would make sense and it would work. Few people read books on technical subjects and therefore authoring such a book would be career enhancing without inviting much scrutiny. And since it's not so easy to put together a book and finance it, I give the author credit."
4,Minority Report,"Guess I'll be the only complainer, but here goes:Game Play on the high seas: Excellent, 5+ stars. Lots of fun! Thoroughly enjoyable!Sword Fights & Dancing: Miserable, -1 star. Didn't work for me (no hand-eye coordination, I guess). No fun and, as far as I'm concerned, did not add anything to the game.First Sid Meier game I've ever had a problem with. And no, I never played the first Pirates."
2,Failed after 9 months,I have 4 sticks running that are not overclocked and one stick just failed after 9 months.
4,Fighting Fit: Complete SAS Fitness Training Guide,"Adrian Weale served in British Army Intelligence working with various elite units of the British Armed Forces. His book is derived primarily from his contacts within the SAS, Paras and Marine Commandos.Weale covers the human body, nutrition (including a meal plan), exercises, equipment, navigation (for those who will take part in cross-country training) and several different programs.His programs include several for people out of shape (Desk Driver's, Semi-Pro, and Fighting Fit) and one each for those preparing for SAS, Para and Commando training. These last three training programs contain a rigorous schedule which will challenge even the relatively fit. The SAS program emphasizes movement over moutainous terrain, while Para focuses on speedy movement over shorter distances and Commando splits between running and upper body strength."
5,"Delightful, funny and challenging.","My 5 year old was having trouble deciding which bedtime story to choose when I began reading ""It's a Spoon, Not a Shovel"" outloud. Within seconds, the delightful words and outrageous answers had caught his attention, and he snuggled in with me to read the rest of the story. He never once lost interest, answered all the questions correctly (not a great feat, given the choices, but he felt successful nonetheless!!), and was thoroughly intrigued by searching for the not-so-easy to find letters. Great book!"
4,Second purchase,This the second one I've purchased. The first was dropped and never worked again. This one doesn't seem to get as hot as the first but it's still my favorite iron.
2,"Well, depends on what you need it for","As a home iron, sure. As a travel iron...never again. I really did like the iron. What I didn't like was that it blew THREE electric current converters. Three!! The very expensive one with all the adaptors that I bought to take on my 3 week European tour, plus 2 more that I bought in France because I had no way of charging my camera battery. Third time's a charm, because it was at that point that I figured out it was the iron blowing the fuses. On the first, I tried to change the fuse (because it came with 2 extra), but the iron fried it so badly, that the fuse material melted to the connection points in the converter. So, no thanks....I'll go back the slightly crappier travel iron I picked up from Wal-Mart for the last trip I took."
1,Disposable Iron,I purchased this iron and use it for my only iron while we spend extensive time in a motorhome. It began leaking water in a short time then quit working completely within 2 years. I would not purchase it again.
4,LIGHT AND HANDY,"This iron was sturdy and reliable to use in the US and Europe, still I recommend that if you are going to the Middle East or Africa, you do not take it with you, even with the travel adapters, the current over there fried mine."
1,should have paid more for a working iron...,"For the price I wasn't expecting this to be a fantastic iron however i didn't think it was going to be this bad! Like another reviewer mentioned, this iron leaks. I guess it's true that you get what you paid for. Lame product from Rowenta."
1,Cheaply made,"It looks very low quality and it arrived falling apart. I'm returning it for a refund. The sole plate was separated from the body, and I don't like what I saw inside. It has small cheap plastic pieces inside."
3,Works well....but,"I bought this iron a few months ago to use at my sewing table and have been happy with it. It heats up fast and works well, the size is perfect for quilting. However, the handle is open ended and it has slipped through my fingers several times and yesterday it hit the floor. Now the handle won't stay up. I'd be afraid to buy the newer model for fear it would do the same."
4,Nice iron,"Nice iron, very efficient, it worked properly. My only concern is that it is a bit huge for my personal standards; i don't comprehend inches very well since i'm used to centimeters."
2,Rowenta travel iron,"I am a quilter and I use a small iron when sewing quilt seams, ironing pieces of fabric, quilt classes, etc. The iron is awkward to hold compared to my old one. I find it doesn't get hot enough like my old iron. I'm not as happy with it as I thought I would be."
2,"OK for verbal review, Poor for math review","When I first started reading the verbal review portion of this book, I was confident I was learning something. Then I hit the math review section & was absolutely frustrated. The explanatory answers for the math practice test explained the answers maybe half the time. Otherwise I was left still wondering how they got the answer. If you are mathmatically challenged like one of the other reviews mentioned, don't use this book. There were numerous typos. The vocabulary section was comprehensive, & the reading comprehension tips were useful. I'd be very wary of this book though since I bet a fair amount of the answers they say is right to the practice questions are not, or there could be more than one answer. Keep looking for a better review guide."
2,Not for the mathematically challenged,"This book would best be used as a suppplement to other study guides. It doesn't work well on its own. This edition has the same problems reviewers of previous versions discussed: numerous typographical and other errors, such as answer keys not matching the explanations, especially in the non-verbal sections. Those problems, combined with the tendency for the math explanations to skip too many steps, made it extremely frustrating and difficult to fully benefit from the sample problems. However, the general information, tips, and verbal sections were good. Difficult vocabulary words were used in sentences which made it easier to remember the definitions. Analogies were explained quite well."
1,Don't buy this book,"The people who wrote this particular arco book did not know how to do math. Since I am so strong at the verbal section, I would not even know if the answers were correct. In the practice examination section of this book, at least 4 answers were wrong in the quantative section. I don't understand how they can publish this book. I would recommend other acro books, just not this one. I need to get a hold of the editor of this book and give him/her a piece of my mind."
2,Frustration!,"While this book had some good review tips, it was particularly frustrating as it needs some serious editing! Often, answers listed in the answer key were incorrect or the solutions listed did not include the correct answer due to errors in calculations on the part of the editors! This took up a great deal of time that could have been spent studying trying to figure out where I screwed up when, in fact, it was the editors who were at fault! GRE reviews are frustrating enough without having to compensate for the editors' careless errors!"
2,Save your money .. There's nothing new in this book,"When I read about this book I thought it'd offer something new so I got it right away. While reading it I kept saying the next page will tell me something new. Unfortunately that was not true. If this is your first book on the subject, you'll find it interesting and rather informattive. However, if you've read all the previous books about Diana, don't bother with this one. It offers nothing and I mean NOTHING new at all."
2,I am ashamed that I bought this book,"This book was an interesting read, but there was nothing new in it, with the exception of a few little tidbits of gossip...and those things you probably heard on his many many talk show appearances.The majority of this book is old gossip, and his ""sources"" are somewhat questionable. Sometimes even using ""a friend of a nurse who was told by the nurse who was at the hospital..."" as a source, though he doesn't say that explicitly in the book. He also claims not to have paid his sources, though that statement is also questionable.If you really want to read this book, don't contribute to this man's income...as the profits of this book go to him, and not Diana's charities. Go to the library and check it out there. But if you want the ""National Enquirer"" with a pretty, hardback, cover...then buy it."
4,Femme Fatale In Detail,"As much that has already been printed about Princess Di, there is much more. This squeamish portrait of that fatal day is not for the faint of heart. With quotes from nurses, the priest who administered the princess's last rites, even the funeral employees who did her hair and makeup, Andersen's account is riveting, though sometimes very graphic.It won't make you like the Queen any better. After she learned of Di's death, the author says, the Queen called the British embassy in Paris to insist that any royal jewels on the princess be returned at once.You might see Prince Charles in a different light. His planning, over-riding his mother, and devotion to his hurting children will bring some tears about this complex woman who was fated to be forever in our hearts."
2,Save your money and read the excerpt in Good Housekeeping!,"If you've never read anything about Princess Diana, I guess this book would be pretty interesting. The first chapter is fascinating and filled with new information, but it's all covered in the excerpt in Good Housekeeping magazine which came out in late August. The rest of the book is NOTHING new!"
4,Unbeleavable BOOK,This is the fifth time iread this book it's fantastic i think i'll read 10 times because it talks from the the writers heart to our hearts
5,This book is a real page turner!,My favorite part of this book are the portions where Mr. Andersen portrays the Princess as having the time of her life aboard the Jonikal. I couldn't get enough of the jet-set courtship and couldn't believe some of the information he has come out with. It was well written and it took me only 3 days to finish. Though some of it was sad and bittersweet. A real good read for a look into the last few weeks of her tragic life.
5,"Intruiging, thought provoking and tragic....","Splendidly written! I was so relieved to discover that Diana was HUMAN! She always seemed so surreal, it was fabulous to see that she could cuss like a human, and feel the same things in life we all do. I almost hoped though, that the ending of the book would be different. That history could be re-written, and she would still be with us. But alas, she is gone, and I now have this wonderful book to read, and re-read, and feel as though I could have known her. She would have made a better queen than Elizabeth...the tin queen still looking for a heart....."
5,A must for all diana-fanatics who miss her so much.,"This book was grest,so much detail!I highly recommend it,it would even interest non-Diana types.A great read,you can't put it down!oz"
3,Something Old - Something New,"Readers should be aware that this book covers events in Diana's life that have already been covered in exhaustive detail by many other sources. Furthermore, Mr. Anderson's writing style seemed frothy at times to me. However, he does provide highly detailed information about the accident, the medical treatment Diana received at the accident site & subsequently at the hospital, & the reactions of various members of the Royal Family to the accident & the public's later reaction to the death of the Princess. For readers interested in the subject, I think they will find this book to be generally worthwhile."
3,A very good behind the scenes read,This book was difficult to put down and was not afraid to outline the callous actions of the Queen in the face of this tragedy. It was well researched and I found it extremely enjoyable but sensitively written and tinged with the sadness of the loss of a wonderful princess.
4,A Life Lived - A Life Wasted - A Love Lost,"Diana's death left such personal voids in so many lives, from those who knew her to those who did not. This book reaffirms every emotion when we first learned of the Princess' untimely death. Unfortunately, it now seems even more senseless and tragic, as well as inevitable.Like the heroine of a greek tragedy, Diana exhibited a childlike naivete where people, particularly men, were concerned. Despite all her charitable efforts, loneliness consumed her. In her quest to find true love she appeared blinded and pitiable, portraying an almost prepubescent-like caricature of the Diana we thought we knew.How sad it had to end here in what seems to be the middle of her story. I, as well as so many others, would have loved to have seen her overcome the demons that haunted her. And in the end, as we had hoped in the beginning of her fairytale, to live happily ever after."
5,Tear Jerker,"Out of the many many books I've read since Diana's death 4 years ago, this has to be the best and most informative. Just reading about her in the hospital after the accident was enough to start my water works up. I recommend a box of tissues at your side. Apart from the emotional factor of this book, it's also very interesting to read about Dodi's father and his thoughts. This is a well researched account of the day Diana died and I recommend it."
5,"An exceptional, chronological look at the death of Diana.","I have had a very hard time putting this book down! Christopher Anderson has written a book that captures the final months of Diana's life and includes comments and quotes from friends who shed light on the Princess' romance with Dodi Fayad and the shock of all those close to her when they learned of her death. Very interesting is the reaction of her former husband, Prince Charles, but also the completely unsympathetic reaction of Queen Elizabeth, who appears to be more concerned with royal jewelry, than with that fact that her grandsons' mother is dead. The book is a fast read, but fills in many of the blanks surrounding the death of Diana. If you were moved by the death of Diana, this is a MUST HAVE book"
4,"I was transfixed, but skeptical.","I wasn't sure what to expect when I started reading this book. The author covers not only the actions of Diana and Dodi before their fateful night, but the actions of what everyone else was doing at the time of the accident and at the time of her death. This is an easy read, as it reads like an article in the Enquirer. And yes, I found myself transfixed, against my better judgement. I have some questions about the authenticity of some of the information in the book. After all, who is really going to tell the author that Prince Charles was wearing blue pajamas at the time he received the call about Diana. And, I admit to learning more about the actual accident than I wanted to know. All in all, I would recommend the book, but keep in mind that not all the information may be fact."
1,Worth what I paid for it!,"A prior passenger had left (probably intentionally) a copy of Anderson's work in my airline seat pocket. With nothing else to occupy my time on a long flight, I read the book. I can't imagine anyone other than a devout royalophile enjoying this tabloid-esque sort of missive. Strictly for ""Enquiring minds."""
1,Enough already!,"Why do people flock to a book like this? They think its a tribute to Diana while they miss what it really is; yet another chance for an otherwise talentless writer to cash in on the tragedy. Her death is now a money making industry in and of itself with every would-be-author jumping into the ring to pump out a quick book and grab some cash. Spare me the "" it was a tribute"" or ""a labour of love"" excuses. It's greed. Pure and simple.My advice, if you really honestly love the lady and everything she stood for, is stop funding these hack writers, put away your Elton John single, and move on with your life. Just because it has a pretty cover doesn't hide the fact that it's tabloid journalism. Or if you remember, the very thing that helped drive the princess to an early grave."
2,Not much more than was on 'Good Morning America',"I was eagerly awaiting the release of this book and am sorry to say that most of what I read was already talked about on TV or in the papers in the reviews. Although interesting reading, I didn't come away satisfied and still felt I wanted to know more. Realizing that we probably will never know all of the facts, the book does offer interesting commentary from various sources. I question the validity of some of the material presented. A quick read but don't consider it one of my more memorable Diana books."
1,It's not Jackie after Jack.,"I had just read Jackie after Jack and was looking forward to this book because I've always been interested in Diana. This book was a waste of time; there's very little that was new in it. Knowing that the Royal family doesn't give interviews, I was very sceptical about some of the scenes described.I think the author has tarnished his well-earned reputation for 'Jack and Jackie' and 'Jackie after Jack' with this book.Diana fans, this is not the book for you!"
2,This book offers very little new insights into Diana's death,"Diana fans will be disappointed with the rehash of material from previous books about her life including the often repeated courtship, marriage and divorce stories that don't mesh with the title of this book. The amount of new information offered here could be covered in a magazine article. I expected something equivalent to The Day Kennedy Was Shot by Jim Bishop. A better book covering Diana's death is Death of a Princess:The Investigation by Sancton and MacLeod."
2,A Big Swing and a Miss,"Christopher Andersen writes one of the most gripping and emotional first chapters I have ever read. However, Andersen needlessly defuses the emotion by rehashing already known facts of Diana's life with her parents, the Royal Family and Charles. Only after wasting lots of pages going over old ground does Andersen get back to the point of the book: The Day Diana died. It would have been a much stronger book had Andersen stuck to his premise, and wrote a day by day account about how the Media, government, public, and Royal family dealt with Diana's death, and how their actions and reactions affect the way the public views Diana, the Royal Family and the media."
5,WOW,"I've read a lot of Diana books (and passed them along,donated them, etc.) and then I found THIS one. This isno screaming tabloid...it is well-written journalism,sensitive, and has lots of info I didn't know! I readit, bought another copy, and gave it to a friend...myphone rang 3 days later, and here was my pal: ""I can'tstop READING this book!! I can't put it DOWN!"" Well,I couldn't put it down either. I'm sorry I never gotto meet Henri Paul (despite his alcoholism). This isa real Keeper for my library. Enjoy!"
4,not for everyone,"I don't really care for ""jam bands"" but I picked this up because I liked ""Conquer Me"" and thought the rest would be in the same vein.Well it is. They could've worked on the songs a bit more - or cut a few out- but overall I think anyone could enjoy what they find here."
4,TRINA MAGNA,"Trina Magna is an opus in six minutes. You know the chill you got up your spine when you first heardthe Vienna Boys Choir on You Can't Always Get What You Want? Well, the chill is back when Popper'sheavenly harmonica strafes the choir at the end of TM. Truley transcendent. This is a hell of a disc."
4,Let's Save My Soul,"Okay, let's cut to the chase - if you are here, you are here for a reason. Save His Soul, definitely stands out from the rest of the Blues Traveler albums. Although not necesarily for the best, the album rings of a undefined, inquisitive nature. It feels more of an attempt rather than a natural offspring, but nonetheless, still rocks and excites the listener. Trina Magna, Whoops, and Go Out Side & Drive are the principal driving forces off this one, while the harmonica on Fledging is simply beautiful. Some of the songs though are better live - Love and Greed - NY PROPHESIE - for example, and Love of My Live is grows more valuable with each listen. Overall, much more focused delivering the point of J.P. through writing, but essential, to me, nonetheless."
4,One of their best,"One of the best CD's from Blues Traveller.The best tracks on this CD are Trina Magna, Letter from a friend, and Conquer Me. Overall a great CD."
5,Best of Blues Traveler,"I really think this the best and most powerful album BT has ever made nothing could match this one. I have all 6 albums and this one is the best. Whoops, Trina Magna, and Go Outside and Drive are awesome songs. Popper's hospital boredom really transalate's into this album"
4,An underrated masterpiece,This is by far the best blues traveler album ever. My favorite tracks are Trina Magna & Love & Greed. The emotion that is heard on this record is fantastic. It's a damn shame that this record is out of print and hard to find. Do yourself a favor and go find it. You'll be glad you did.
2,Not very durable...,The toy was a lot of fun but would loose charge somewhat quickly. Ok though cause the charge time was about 15min. Was unhappy though when the plastic teeth / gears stripped in the motor or something. So after about 2 days of playing with it it's now somewhat of a very expensive piece of trash. My little one was also very disappointed that it had broken so easily.
4,"Fun toy, not good for teeny kids","I bought this toy for my nephew, who is 2. My brother and I ended up playing with it instead and we are 36 and 31! It's a really cool toy, but watch out for the propeller on the bottom, as my brother almost took off a thumb when he caught the ufo in midair. It goes REALLY high!!! We took it outside and with a slight breeze you may loose this thing in the trees, but it goes way beyond the top of the pine trees around here... which is over 3 stories. I almost got it caught on the roof. At night it is REALLY cool.. the lights flash and it looks like a real ufo. My nephew was over here and we took it outside and he kept saying, ""COOL COOL!!"" It doesn't last very long on one charge, I'd say about 5 mins... but it was neat nonetheless.. I only paid (...) for it at a local crafts store. It was worth the money to see my nephew enjoy it."
5,COOL!!,this toy is so cool because it has lights. And in a small room it does not hit walls it stays the highth you put the triger and my brother gets his nerf gun and shoots it and it wiggles but it does not fall down.In our entry way that's about 20 feet high it goes all the way to the top and toches.GET ONE NOW!!!
4,Cool toy.,"While the commercials make it look more amazing than it is, it's still a cool toy. The remote control allows you to control the speed of the fan and make the saucer go up and down. You can't control left and right and the slightest breeze will cause it to take off. That's the fun part in a way... the unpredictable behavior. We've had ours for 2 years now and the kids love it. Yeah, they go a while without playing with it, but when they bring it out, it a blast."
2,Junkie but cool,"This product only lasted for 1 day! I played with it 10 times and it stopped working. Then it worked again. Then it broke! Two days later I threw it in the garbage!!! Don't buy this thing. I made a mistake. I'm getting the Air Hogs copter instead. Also, this isnt made by Spinmaster. It's made by some company called Overbreak."
1,Poorly made,"My 10 year old loved this toy, however, we have only had it two days and already have returned it twice. The first time it just stopped going up and down (which is really all it does) for no reason after a few uses. The second time, it landed on its side (which it often does) and it again stopped working. Luckily, we live close to the store.Don't waste your money unless you enjoy standing in line to return it time and time again."
1,Very poorly made,Add me to the list of people whose Hover Copter broke without reason. After three days the propeller just stopped working. Very annoying.
2,Good idea but need to make it more relible and rugged,Had to return this toy. the propeller stopped working after 2-3 uses. Fragile construction.
2,"fun, but ceap","I got this toy for my birthday and really liked it, but it broke right away. The propeller just stopped working. We emailed the company and they said it was defective. So we returned it and got a new one and the same thing happened. I decided that this product was cheap. So unless you want to be really disapointed with a product don't get this piece of junk."
1,Save your money,"We have gone through too many of these flying saucers to count. They break easily & don't hold a charge. When it is charged it will take off with great speed, up. There is NO controlling where it goes after that. It lasted a week, the kids are upset that it didn't last longer. The 'spokes' from the center to the outer circle have been glued and taped to extend its life, but that too didn't help. dud"
1,WORST THING EVER,"I FLEW THIS THING TWICE. THE FIRST TIME IT WENT ABOUT A FOOT IN THE AIR AND TURNED UPSIDE DOWN FALLING BACK TO THE GROUND. THE SECOND TIME IT WENT ABOUT TEN FEET UP AND WHEN IT HIT THE GROUND IT WAS BROKEN. I CAN STILL HEAR THE MOTOR WHINING BUT THE PROPELLER WON'T MOVE FAST ENOUGH TO LIFT IT UP. IT WAS FUN FOR THE 30 SECONDS I USED IT, BUT OVERALL-WORST SPENT 20 BUCKS EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DO NOT BUY THIS, IT IS JUNK"
2,Hover-copter?Stinks!!,"The hover-copter is very fun to use.The only problem with mine is that I can only use it for about 2 minutes.Another thing that I hate about the hover-copter is that you can't control it and sometimes it goes to places that you don't want it to go.Oh yeah,it's not durable at all.So I recommend you to not even bother to buy one.Honest!!"
5,This toy is a blizzard of fun,"From my 8 yr old....We got this as a gift six months ago and it's still fun. It takes practice to lean how to control it, and landing is kind of hard until you learn the trick. You have to be careful of your fingers because the blade goes fast. It goes very high. It's really exciting and it is worth the money."
2,Hover Copter plopper,"My dad bought this for me after I saw it in Hamleys in London.It worked OK for a few turns then the motor went on and stayed on until the battery went flat. We took it back to Toys r Us, who had none left. We then went to Wallmart and were told that they were selling them for $ 10.00 Canadian, and TOys r Us sold them for $ 30.00.How can there be such a difference in price?"
4,Intriguing Mystery/Thriller,"I watched this because Dean Silvers and Marlen Hecht have made some of my favorite indie films ever, and I was not disappointed. It has their usual quirky sensibilities, but applied to a New York City corporate conspiracy. Think female activist Serpico character in a film with humor."
4,Review of Measuring Poverty,Anyone concerned with the problems of measurement of poverty and with realistic solutions should read this book.
5,Great Sloane Illustrations,"If you enjoy Eric Sloane's illustrations, you will want this book. Many of the items illustrated in this book have appeared elsewhere in Eric Sloane's books. But this book is comprised exclusively of illustrations with short captions to provide the necessary information. It would be a nice way to introduce young readers to Sloane's work."
5,One of a long line of great CD's!!,"Witness brings new life to harmonization. The vocal range of tese for young ladies is outstanding! The lyrics written and Produced by Mike Brooks come to life with their vocal skills. Truly inspirational, but it will also making you pat your foot, and snap your fingers a must have!!!"
5,A Voice that Captures an Era,"The Portuguese have a word, ""saudade,"" described as the seventh most difficult word in the language to translate. But I'll try: it refers to the longing one can feel for something one hasn't actually experienced. ZOOT SUIT MURDERS takes people back to the duck tail era if they knew it, produces saudade in the rest of its readers. Sanchez will often accumulate 100 pages of hand written notes - phrases, sentences, half sentences - while searching for a voice. He does not begin writing a story until he has found that voice and is thinking in it. This is one of the secrets to his powerful ability to lure his readers into time and place and make the present recede."
5,Expert advice from an expert,"Sylvia Bashline, author of The New Cleaning & Cooking Fish, is just the right person to tell you how to clean and cook a fish that you've just caught. She's served as president of the Pennsylvania Outdoor Writer's Association and also as a board member of Outdoor Writers Association of America.Her book makes lavish, skilful use of color photography to tell you everything you need to know about preparing a fish to eat, once you've caught it. Plus, there are dozens and dozens of mouth-watering recipes for cooking fish by every method you can imagine."
4,Favorite Christmas Gift,My son started paging through this cookbook right after he opened the gift at Christmastime. He is very anxious now to go fishing so he can make these new recipes. I am very pleased with the cookbook.
5,Great book,"A good book, just what I ordered, it came on time and the price was right. Will use it each time I or someone with me catches a fish. The recipies look delicious."
5,It doesn't get any better than this.,"By far the finest novel I have ever read. It actually had me gasping out loud in parts , and crying in others. Demille only has one fault, and that is he doesn't write enough books.All of his novels are 10s but Word of Honor blows away anything I have ever read, and I read a lot of books"
4,Word of Honor,"This is a great book, very exciting, keeps you on the edge of your seat. I am going to look for some other Demille books that I haven't read."
5,A Must Read!!,"By far one of my favorite DeMille books, this one grabs you by the throat and doesn't let go until the very end of the story. If only every book I read could be so compelling. I've been handing down my books to my father, who is a voracious reader and the last time I gave him a carton of books, he went straight for the DeMille novel. It's hard not to get hooked on this talented writer! For a non-stop read, pick up this paperback, you won't regret it."
5,Just Doesn't Get Any Better.,I'll make this review short and sweet. This is the best fiction I have ever read. It had me gasping out loud in some spots. Just the best read ever.
4,One of DeMille's best,"Nelson DeMille can be very inconsistent in my opinion, but this is one of his better books. Despite the fact that it's about a truly ugly subject, it holds up extremely well as entertainment. Furthermore, it truly changed the way I viewed it's subject... the Viet Nam War, and the people who fought it.The protagonist is a fairly obstinate and aggravating character - an ex-army lieutenant who commanded a platoon in Viet Nam, and is now a civilian and a married, successful businessman. He's filled with so much anger about the war, that he's unreasonable with everyone, including his own family, which often makes his behavor less than sympathetic. Believable, though - a very interesting read and a page turner. A good story, and a convoluted but credible mystery."
3,Early Demille effort; his later stuff is better,"Having read and enjoyed other books by the author, I found an abridged taped version of this one--and so jumped at the opportunity to listen to it . . . wasn't terrible, just not as good as some of his other novels . . . the other problem I had with it: I sort of knew where it was going, right from the beginning."
2,A disapointed DeMille fan,"This book is a let down. I like DeMille because his characters and well developed and true to life. The characters in this book are truly under developed and dull. In fact in the third part of the book there is almost no character development it is just a long trail with the same story told several diffrent ways.I waited for this book to pick up and be the usual fast paced DeMille I love, but it never did. Skip this and read The Gold Coast or The Generals Daughter instead. They are better reads."
4,after reading this on holiday in Vietnam,"It's a good story, well written. A real page-turner.Sitting here in NaTrang, watching the kids running on the beach it's hard to believe that the War ended 27 years ago. But the book forgets something very basic about the war: most of the soldiers were not college kids, but working class lads who had no grasp of the huge mistake they were involved in. It was a class-war for the benefit of generals who needed a place to stage a conflict. What a sad time it was."
2,One word: disappointing,"I'm a big fan of Demille but this was his worst effort, in my opinion. A plot too unbelieveable to even consider, a confusing mass of characters and not among them, anyone you particularly care about. Disappointing Demille."
1,VIET NAM,THE EVENTS ABOUT VIET NAM ARE BELIEVABLE--BUT TYSON APPEARSTOO GOOD A GUY TO BE BELIEVABLE.
4,DeMille is de Man!,Huge fan of Nelson DeMille's work. I saw this on Amazon and had not heard of this work so I bought it thinking I would take it on our trip to Europe this summer but promptly changed my mind when it arrived. The beast is 850 pages big!! But I'm about 1/2 way through and it really IS a good read so far. It did receive much good praise when it came out in the 80's and I can see why. Enjoy!
5,DeMille Fan,"I have read most of Nelson DeMille's books, but some how had missed this one. I am so glad it was re-published as it has become one of my favorites. I love his style of writing working in a great amount of fact within his fiction. I have received a tremendous education concerning the Vietnam War through his work and ""Word of Honor"" was excellent in adding to my knowledge."
5,Another Great by DeMille,"True to DeMille . . . he builds a great story that takes unexpected turns that leaves you wondering ""how is this all going to end up?"" Characters to either love or hate, intrigue, and and unpredictable ending. A great read and hard to put down."
5,Classic page turner,I could not put this book down until I finished it. The main character is someone anybody could identify with and the plot is fast paced and interesting. Definitely Demille's best work.
5,"Intriging, could not put down, educational, fantastic","If you are looking to be captivated and entertained, as well as educated and intrigued, read this book. Each and every chapter is well written and Nelson Demille does a great job all the way to the end. The story is about a really interesting man whose past includes an incredible experience in the Vietnam War. It gave me an appreciation for those who were in the war, including my dad. Also, it's neat how the book goes back and forth from the present to his past. This is the first Nelson Demille book I read, since then I've read Plum Island, Gold Coast, and Cathedral. Just purchased Generals Daughter and Charm School. His books are awesome!"
5,Glad I am sick,I have been in bed sick for two days and don't wish to get well until I finish this fabulous book. I love all Nelson DeMille's books and can't wait for his next. He is an amazing story teller and I can't get the story out of my mind. Good thing I am sick as I would be getting nothing done.
5,Another classic from DeMille,"I agreed with one reviewer about the strikes against this novel. Although I have now come to appreciate DeMille's books and am not scared off by the length but a story about Vietnam that also includes a trial seemed unlike any of his previous books, needless to say the subject didn't interest me. However, Word of Honour in my opinion is his best. You wonder what other stories are there for Tyson when he was in Vietnam and his life now. If you're a fan of Nelson DeMille you have to read this one!"
5,Practical,This book is full of practical advice as well as a ton of resources to use for professional development. Don't leave home without it!
2,You need the prior publication,"The workbook without the prior publication, Understanding by Design by McTighe and Wiggins, is useless."
4,Understanding by design: Professional development workbook,This is a very useful book for class. Has many good activities in it. I think it is worth the purchase.
4,Bought it for school and still use it.,"Understanding by design was recommended to me by one of my teachers. This book helped me understand how to approach lesson planning. Backwards design is an excellent way to design curriculum. The templates are very helpful, and almost mindless even. You just have to know what your goals are, and the templates help you do the rest.I think they should come up with a computer program to make it even easier, but hey, writing is good practice. I rated it four stars, because I haven't found some of the information int he back too helpful- of course I haven't thoroughly read it. I guess it's there for something, but I'm a stickler for not including unnecessary information."
4,Very Good!,"Weel, I was ""trying"" to find something interesting and finally it happened. The book has a solid explanation of concepts, and every example is quite illustrative. The section that covers Posix threads is very good. And I'm sure that this is the one of the best beginner's guide to socket programming.If you wants to develop TCP/IP programming, this is THE book."
5,Even if you live in the U.P. - this is a wonderful book!,I've visited relatives in the U.P. for several years and recently moved up here and I love the natural beauty in so many places! This is a fabulous book and after reading it - I'm ready to search out some of really rugged spots you can't get to by car. I'm not a big one for getting out in the winter - but after reading Lon's section on winter - I'm going to get myself some snowshoes!!! How nice of Lon to share some of his favorite spots with us.
3,It doesn't pack much of a punch,"It doesn't pack much of a punch, but the mellow vocals and experimental instrumentation combination may take you down to the mat just the same."
3,Book Fantastic... shipping.,"I had spent so long searching for this book because David Levithan is one of my favorite authors. Then finally Amazon was selling it so I jumped on the opportunity to purchase it! The book is a must read and really would appeal to a teenager with a close brother and those who love road-trip books (John Green fans especially). The only problems I had (and have had with Amazon in the past) is that the books are in a odd quality. They're a little dirty and maybe crinkled at the edges. Either terrible shipping quality or just lots of moving around in the warehouse. The physical book may not be appealing but it's what's in the content, right?"
4,A good introduction,"I thought that this was a good introduction to stock market investing. Overall, it is fairly comprehensive, with discussions about portfolio planning, stock research, technical analysis, and stock market theories. While it is not an in-depth text, it does give a good survey of stock investing. I think that this is probably the best introductory book on stocks that I have read."
4,All about stocks is really all about stocks,"This book offers a complete overview off really everything about stocks. All types of analysis and examples are given on a objective base. So the reader gets a lot of information about the subject, while he is not put in a corner to follow a certain strategy when it comes to buying and selling stocks. The book is sometimes a little academic but it's still readible for people like me without an economic background.This book thought me really a lot of new stuff and finally gave me accurate information around all kinds of analysis regarding to the stock market. It's far better than the 'trustfull information about a certain stock' you've got from a good friend."
1,Yuck!,"Am I the only Aerosmith fan who thinks that everything recorded after 'Live Bootleg' is complete trash? Sad to say it, but Aerosmith recorded their best stuff when Steven and Joe were completely wrecked out of their minds on chemicals...not that I wish they'd start up again, that is (even tho Steven can't seem to stop drifting in and out of rehab)...'Dude (Looks Like A Lady)' is the most nerve-wracking of the whole mess...the sax in it sounds like a goose getting its neck wrung. 'Rag Doll' is almost as bad...where's the heaviness of 'Rocks'? Where's the biting sneer of 'Hand That Feeds'? Some bands outstay their welcome because their legions of old-time fans either don't have the heart to realize that they have become completely irrelevant, or their newer fans don't know the difference between the classic stuff they recorded and the rehashed and inferior stuff they record today. Aerosmith has gone on for about 15 years too long...say goodnite, boys."
1,Aerosmith or Air Supply ????????,"If this what you get when you stop doing drug's, I've got one thing to say. I'M BUYING!!!!!! This cant be the same Aerosmith from the '70's. Maybe they should go on tour with the backstreet boys. GARBAGE!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Uh.....NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I can't believe that this album is what helped them regain their popularity again. It just baffles me. This album goes against everything and I mean EVERYTHING that Aerosmith stands for. It does have a ""few"" pleasant moments though. Hangman Jury, Heart's Done Time, the Movie and probably the highlight of the record, I'm Down; which of course is a cover of the Beatles song, which is almost, note for note, identical to the Beatles. The other stuff is just WAY too pop and polished for my Aerosmith taste. And ANGEL? .......oh...let's not even go there....."
1,are you joking?,"This is by far the absolute most horrible record that was ever made in the history of music.The only Aerosmith songs worth listening to are ""dream on"" and ""janie's got a gun"".I mean,""dude"" is by far the worst song that was ever made.I can't think of any song that could possibly be worser than that one.That,and ""angel"" show you how much they completely sold out.If your going to listen to this band,at least listen to some of their 70s stuff,because everything they did in the 80's was garbage."
1,I LAUGH AT THESE KIDS WHO THINK THIS IS GOOD,"KIDS: If you want good Aerosmith, buy (or let your parents buy you) following Aerosmith CDS:1. AEROSMITH (FEATURING DREAM ON)2. GET YOUR WINGS3. TOYS IN THE ATTIC4. ROCKS5. LIVE:BOOTLEGUnfortunately thats the only Aerosmith cds that are worth talking about. Permanent Vacation sucks.... Way too commercial.... My friends think the same think, not just I.... SO BUY THESE 5 CDS AND STOP LISTENING TO PERMANENT VACATION, PUMP, AND NINE LIVES!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Aerosmith Permanent Vacation,Aerosmith Permanent Vacation audio cd. This cd is a good older cd from Aerosmith.would definitely recommrnd this cd to a friend.
4,Fine comeback after the previous two records.,"I read some of the reviews on this page and felt compelled to add my own. This is a great Stereophonics album and for those who apparently don't know it is the bands fifth recording. The album shakes off the experimental, laid back feel of JEEP and You've Gotta Go There To Come Back and returns to the heavier, up tempo sounds of Performance And Cocktails and the fantastic debut Word Gets Around. True enough Dakota is a stand out track but Superman and Devil are equally as strong and there is plenty of strength in depth to go with it. Anyone who isn't familiar with the band I'd definitely recommend this album but I'd also suggest the first two aswell. I'm from Caerphilly; South Wales and was fortunate to hear their early tracks before they signed with V2 and released Word Gets Around."
4,You'll be happy you bought this one,"I listened to this cd about 6-7 times, then I realized that this is easily one of the Phonics' best albums to date. Man, these tracks just grow on you, getting better and better eveytime you hear em. The tracks are all pretty high-octane, with Kelly Jones' awesome vocals adding the signature Phonics sound. Songs like Devil, and Superman, Dakota, and especially hard-rockin Deadhead being the best, I think. This cd very worthwhile indeed. If you like The Verve, Oasis or Radiohead, you should go for it."
2,Try Before You Buy,"I had never heard of the Stereophonics before Live8 but was taken by the song ""Dakota"". Regrettably, I raced out and bought the album without listening to the rest of it first. I am not saying this is necessarily bad music but, if you are expecting to hear an album full of songs similar to Dakota, you will be disappointed. The album obviously appeals to some but I found it monotonous and lacking variety in sound and song style. The sound has a hardness to it and seems under-engineeered with louder passages becoming a matter of volume over quality. You may love it but go and listen to the whole album first. In retrospect, I should just have bought the single of Dakota."
3,eh....,This album is just average. I don't feel there are any strong track on this album. I think this group has a very generic sound.
2,"LANGUAGE,SEX,VIOLENCE,GARBAGE",Ouch.i just bought this yesterday.i really regret the 19 euros i paid for it.thankfully i also bought The Beautiful South's Miaow for 1.05 euros too..The latter was a lot better than this garbage.Theres only 2 decent songs in here.Dakota and Lolita.Guys it's time you split up.once you were a great alternative band.Now you're a waste of time and money.
1,BAH- no longer in my backpack gear.,"HEAVY , and doesn't carry enough water to justify the weight.SUCKING HEAVILY- is what you'll do to try and get a SIP of water out it . Plus you have to squeeze the hell out of it to get H2O out of it.I think I burned more energy trying to drink water than i did on the hiking trip...I've now switched to iodine tabs after this expensive lesson."
5,Amazing Jeff Goldblum,"Jeff Goldblum brings a breath of quirky fresh air to the series. He is great with Juliette, together they have a natural style and fit well together. I hate when their episodes end, and can't wait for the next. I am a fan of all the Law & Order franchises, but I have to say this duo is the absolute best. Even the story lines seem more interesting."
4,Review Title,"If you're interested in Abbagnano's thought, then this is a must have. Langiulli treats all of the necessary prerequisites to get a beginner's grasp Abbagnano's philosophy."
4,Guitar is the star on this Klepacki title.,Klepacki shreds on this solo release. I'm so glad he puts enough music aside to release these albums amidst his prolific composing for gametracks.
3,Holiday Blahs,"I have this on CD, so I'm somewhat surprised that only the cassette is listed in Amazon--but even that's listed as being unavailable. Not surprising that it's gone out of print. Like so many holiday efforts by anonymous MUZAK ensembles (and this is NOT the London Symphony ORCHESTRA, of that I'm sure), this effort is uninspired and uninspiring. There isn't much in the way of originality or virtuosity here. Determining how to sequence and what to include in the three medleys they offer is about as imaginative as it gets. But it's OK background music for one's holiday festivities. No one's going to get too distracted from their present opening or egg nog sipping while this is on. But it may add a bit to the holiday ambience. Give it that much."
5,kills all,"Dead down wind is not for hunting alone. Dead down wind is also the best odor killer i have ever seen to kill liquor breath. I know 4 different people that had some drinks, used this product, then when they got home their wives/girlfriends could not smell any trace of alcohol at all."
5,Awesome thunderstorm when you can't have a real one!,I love this CD and listened to it often when I had it. Unfortunately when I moved 2 years ago I got the jewel case and my roommate wound up with the CD! Hopefully Amazon will get some more so that we both can order it!
4,If you like rain and thunder you'll love this CD.,The only way this CD could be improved is for it to be released in Dolby Digital 5.1.
5,An Excellent Introduction,"I read this book after having read about 160 pages of the O'Reilly ""Learning Python"". I found Guido van Rossum's introduction to be very well-written. His examples showed some interesting things that ""Learning Python"" hadn't, such as the pickle library, and he included a clear but brief treatment of Python exception handling. Possibly not the best for a complete beginner, but if you've seen a little Python before, it does a wonderful job. Be aware that this text is available as part of the standard Python documentation, but having the hard copy is friendlier to the eyes and part of the profit goes back to open source."
3,"I love this, but not true to size.",I bought this for my miniature dachshund. And she is about 8.5 lbs. I bought this for her and she is almost a year old and it's still too big! This can't be a true to size extra small.
2,Easy Rider Car Harness,It is too easy for the dog to get out of. We had one before that worked much better on our other dog. Don't know where we got it though.
3,Chewed right through that bad boy,"The harness was easy to use and I think would have worked fine but our dog chewed right through the leash that was connected to the seat belt. I was watching him and stopped him when I saw him trying to mess with it but somehow he was able to slice right through it. He didn't like being confined to the belt but will jump out of the car and take off the minute you open the door. I don't know what to try next, something with chain not leashmaterial. He is a chewer and has teeth like razors obviously."
3,well made but. . .,this product is very well made but unfortunately my 10 lb. little poodle does not like it all--may try it again with him in the future.
1,Terrible,"It might just be my dog, but this thing did not work for me at all. The way it connects to the seat belt was unsafe and my dog became tangled and almost choked to death. I had to reach in the back and disconnect the seat belt. I think what this product needs is a turn buckle so that if the dog twists or turn the harness will allow it."
1,What a hassle...,This harness looked so comfy in the picture.It was very difficult to get on my dog & the more I triedthe worse it got.
1,extremely unhappy,iasked for the glasses in the photo and i recieved whatever the retailer wanted to send me.
1,Right out of 1990,"That's not good for software. I have spent the last hour looking at this. The quality is that of pre-internet days. It's unintuitive, difficult to navigate, and cumbersome. Avoid."
2,"Not worth it, save your money",Bought this for my three year old for christmas and it was one of my worst purchases. The remote didn't work even though we inserted brand new batteries. Total waste of money and a big disappointment.
3,Close-Fitting,"This isn't a bad necklace for its price. However, I think it should mention in the description that this is a close-fitting necklace. It would probably be more accurate to call it a choker. If you're like me, you prefer a necklace that isn't quite so clingy."
3,"Very, very specific target market","Are you interested in dyeing something using authentically ancient-to-medieval techniques, or in knowing how one might undertake such an activity? No? Then this book isn't for you.Medievalists, SCA members, fashion designers, and novelists looking for a little added authenticity in their old-timey stories will probably find this fascinating and indeed useful - because this is a very practically-oriented book, helpfully divided into sections covering general pointers on dyeing, plus specific chapters for 'reds, purples, blues,' 'yellows, golds, oranges,' and 'browns, blacks' - you WILL be able to use this to dye clothing, assuming you can come by the raw material.Others, however, will most likely feel _Ancient Dyes for Modern Weavers_ to be not so much bad as pointless."
3,"Adequate overview of the field, but too expensive","The book basically summarises, without going too much into mathematical modelling which is such a hit with behavioural ecologist seeking regonition of their subject as a HARD science, just like experimental psychologists were doing in the 70's coming up with all sorts if theorem and formulas predicting and quantifying the learning process (to no avail though), the latest developments (NOT adavnces, as most of the theoretical breakthroughs and insights were back in the late 70's) in the field, though I would suggest the money is better spent on the great works of William Hamilton, in 2 volumes, Narrow Roads to Gene Land, or the book Sperm Competition and Sexual Selection edited by Tim Birkhead, whereby you can have an in depth exposition on inclusive fitness and the evolution of sex."
4,Music from abroad.,"Wonderful music from the Isles which contain Ireland ,Scotland,Britain and Wales. Nostalgia buffs will love this one. A pretty voice with lively accompaniment."
4,time and time again,"Barry white is truly an inspirational musician and person. Going on for more than 3 decades he proves he can still get jiggy with his new music. I am a teenager and mostly like his new 90's hits as preferred to his older ones. Its funny how when you hear a song that you like when your really young that moment in time and what you did at that specific time stays in your memory. In this case everytime i hear the song ""practice what you preach"" it brings back memories of when i was in 7th grade technology class turning on the radio hearing this song, and going out to buy the album the same day. Thanks Barry for those memories. 4 stars"
2,ONE CLASSIC SINGLE AND AN ALBUM OF FILLER,"heres an interesting phenomenon that seems to repeat itself quite often, ancient singer enjoys well deserved comeback with catchy single, follows it up with an album that contains the hit single and a disappointing clutter of filler tracks.""practice what you preach"", the song that put barry back in the picture is here, and it is incredible, possibly the best song he ever recorded. the remainder of this album is dull, repetitve and unimaginative, and not worth hearing. in short, its awful. that pretty much sums it up.i'd recommend the new double album, the ""essential barry white"", for everything you need."
5,Excellent Resource,This is a fabulous book for the person desiring to learn about other religions and also the person interested in converting to another religion. It is written in a reader friendly format that is not overly analytical or bogged down with dry facts. He is amazingly respectful of each religion and shows the beauty in each faith. I borrowed it from the library and now want a copy for my own collection. It is great book for older children and adults alike.
1,Dealz4Real Xbox Headset,Logitech Cordless Headset for Xbox - 980363-0403I purchased 2 Xbox sets from Dealz4real and got them ontime but neither of the 2 work. From 2 other review I just read Dealz4real is not very good at replacing products. Will update after I cotact them.
3,Wireless Controller has glitches,"The first controller we purchased did not work properly, so we had to contact Logitech. They promptly replaced the product, so I have no problems at all with their customer service (with the exception that it took 3 long distance phone calls to get through to a representative). The product itself, however, still does not quite live up to expectations. The controller requires increasingly frequent charging and often does not fully charge, even when being left on the charger for a full 24 hours. It cuts out in the middle of games, leaving the user unable to communicate with other players. I would not recommend this product as a stand-alone communicator. I don't feel it fully lives up to Logitech's reputation for quality in their peripherals. Hopefully, they will work on fixing these problems and bring it up to the standards that I, as a long-time Logitech user, have come to expect."
2,well....,"ON the plus side, it's comfortable and user friendly. On the negative side, the battery stays charged for about 30 minutes. I wouldn't have bought it."
1,Second Time...,"This is the second time i have had a defective product from this company.Like the other fellow,i did a full charge on the unit and it wouldn't go past 45 minutes.I did this twice before i called their service dept.They said send it back to where i purchased it for a replacement or a refund.The seller took care of it but still lost on the shipping charge back.Another thing is the battery is not user replaceable.Turn around time for a battery from them is about a month.Never again."
1,Not happy....,"I ordered this Logitech Wireless Headset thru Amazon from Dealz4Real on Aug 12, 2007. I received the item very quickly - in 2 days. The product came in its original packaging and appeared to be new; however, it didn't work. There was no packing slip, return slip or any kind of paperwork in the shipping box from Dealz4Real. I e-mailed them from my order confirmation e-mail and told them the product didn't work. They e-mailed me back with the return address and a questionnaire and said it would take 7-10 days to get a replacement item. Well, I did what they said, I have confirmation that they received it on August 24th. Today is September 12th and I still don't have a product replacement, a credit to my credit card, and they won't reply by e-mail. I am not happy and do not recommend using this company. The price was right, but it wasn't worth it!"
1,Junk,"DO NOT BUY THIS I repeat DO NOT BUY THIS. Does not hold a charge. Garbage. You'd think Logitech would've fixed this by now its been out for a while. Like a friend told me thats probably why you can't buy it in stores anymore. I wish amazon would let you put no stars, actually this deserves a -20 rating"
1,Terrible in every way,"The battery only lasted 10 minutes, per each 6 hour charge. The microphone ear clip is also weak and doesn't stay on my ear. This is a very bad product."
1,"Poor Price, Poor Quality, Poor Design","I have three complaints about this headset&#9658; $80 is simply too much to pay for an X-Box headset.&#9658; The ear-holding mechanism broke within a week of purchase&#9658; The mute button is on the ear piece and there is not so much as a mute indicator on the communicator plug.I deeply regret this purchase. Even before it broke, I had reverted to the headset that came with my X-Box Live subscription. The mute thing is also a bummer. I was never sure if I was muted or not. It seems to me like a huge oversight on the part of the designer."
1,Horrible,"Hi,There is a constant pinging white noise.People complain about their audio being bad because of it.This headset is heavy.Yes, it looks cool, but have you seen the bluetooth headsets?Need I say more?I am very disappointed in Logitech.-Edward"
5,Looks Fab!,"I do not own the headset yet, but I have already ordered it from amazon, and It is supposed to come awhile after my xbox live starter kit, so I will have to use my louzy wired controler with the stock headset until this new one comes. My impression is that it will be a very good product, because it is logitech, and i have that wireless joystick for pc that they make, and it is fablous. The price? Great price. I got mine for somthing like $25. (buy from abuy4u)but it looks like a great product and i look foward to reciving my headset. Yes, 6 hours can last me a weekend."
1,Logitech Cordless Headset for Xbox!!!!!!!!!!,"I ordered this from amazon, it shipped from 3btech.... and ive had no luck with it... the communicator its self is quite comfortable... but i cannot comment on the quality of the mic or the audio that comes through it because it will not charge... i called logitech tech support and the tech asked me the usual questions (is it plugged in, have you tried a different wall outlet, have you tried jiggling the plug at the communicator end, and so on) after all the questions the tech said that it was defective and that they were running dangerously low on stock of that particular one.So i guess what im trying to say is order at ur own risk and i hope you have better luck with it than i did."
2,Good product bad battery.,"I had no problem with the seller, the product came in good condition without any visable defects.The problem is that the battery didn't work upon arrival, after I replaced the battery (it is not one intended for replacement and I tinker in electronics a bit), The headset work as intended.Because of the nature of the headset the battery is very hard to replace and not intended to be replaced by the average user. So while the product worked as intended after a battery replacement, many customers may get a headset that dosen't work because of this problem."
1,Xbox Cordless head death battery!,"the microphone never worked because the battery was dead. Costumer service attention very good though. they returned a new one for me after I complained but it also had the same problem. they return my money, but the microphone never worked."
1,Item Returned,The cordless head set didn't work and so I returned. I did return this item and did get my money back. Thank You.
3,"Meh, It's Alright","This headset has great range, and provides a clear sound both through the microphone and ear piece. However, my only complaint is the short life this headset has. After about an hour, the headset would die, and the only way to use it would be with the power chord attached. But other than that, good purchase."
2,After three beers I blow a 0.00....?,"After following the directions to the letter I waited for my results to display---thinking that I was well over the limit since I had just polished off half a six pack. I would never drive on three beers anyway, but I wanted to see how my light 160lb body handled three brewskies. Apparently I had plenty of room for more! The readout said 0.00 as though I hadn't touched a drop.Amazing! I wondered how many I would have to drink just to register a number, any number. Quite a lot I found out later. But even then I failed to reach anywhere near the legal limit according to the AlcoMate. Maybe I just got a bad one. But then again, maybe I should go join a drinking contest."
2,Worth what you pay for it,"It seems to work, but also seems to give readings that are high relative body weight and glasses calculation.If you do it 3 times in a row it will give you 3 different readings.Never have confidence in what it tells me."
1,Wildly innacurate and touchy... Please don't rely on this device.,"I had bought this device from a local retailer, hoping to use it as practical party favor and for assisting myself and friends to determine whether we were below legal tolerances for driving. I met with some friends at a bar and we proceeded to start testing the device, following the directions to the letter, -and despite that- the readings would vary depending on not only how forcefully you blew into the sensor, but also how far your mouth was; even varying minor distances. This product is NOT fit for consideration or for accurate readings, not to mention the cheap quality feel of the build materials. Thankfully I was able to return it, but for those browsing; the device shouldn't be trusted for more than a dollar; and even then the money would be better spent towards another pint."
5,Perfect set of colors,I really like these earrings. They are the perfect size since I prefer smaller earrings and the colors are a perfect mix. I can find a pair to match anything I wear.
5,"Great useful material, great format. A must for Architects","This entire series has emerged as an important part of the Enterprise Architecture knowledge base. The format is accessible and easy to navigate. the explanations are top notch and the patterns called out are relevant, and timeless. This is a must for every serious enterprise architect and aspiring architect. You will go back to this book often as a reference."
5,Excellent companion book for design and architecture,This is the second pattern book (after Core J2EE Patterns) since I started reading and using patterns. I did read about high-level GoF but I was always skeptical about ready to use inline with a programming language like Java or VB. This book is another best example yet of where patterns can really improve your application design. Applications don't miraculously integrate with one another; it needs some architecture ideas and practical experience. This book helps to demonstrate some of those ideas as patterns in action. The descriptions of the problems and their possible solutions... just helps to simplifying and resolving the design problem.
5,Required for any architect,"Whether you are new to integration architecture or an experienced professional, this book book is great. I make sure any architect I interview can speak to the topics in this book."
3,"It looks nice, but","This chip and dip set look very nice. The set is practical as to size (for holding dip and holding chips, crackers, etc.). However, there are a few small bubbles in the glass, so the glassware is not super high quality. Also, it seems a little pricey. But I will keep it, and it has already proven functional."
2,Pointless the whole way,"When I finshed reading the book, I really felt like I wasted a good two weeks reading, when I could have read something else. Luckily, it only took me about 2 weeks to read, I was in a hurry. It was my fault for being mislead by the cover and the back description. Of course the main guy does not know who to lose in hand to hand combat. Standard hero stuff. Not much on military stuff, which is what I thought it was. It definitely is not."
2,Early 1970's sci fi from an award winning author.,"Dickson is one of those authors whom I refer to as the psycodelic generation.Many of their novels are literally ""far out"". The Outposter is one of them."
2,"3.5 Ounce TIN , 0.8 Ounce Bay Leaves","After saying the item would be shipped in two days, It took over 3 weeks and is only 0.8 onces of leaves."
3,Nice introduction for beginners,"This book has a nice overview and is certainly interesting if you never had to do with SANs before. Like its predecessor, FibrChannel for Mass Storage, the book is VERY HP oriented and most useful if you live in an HP farm. Otherwise, I'd recommend the Clarks Book as well."
3,Good for a HP Shop,"The book is good for learning about SAN if you know nothing about it right now. But it has a lot of HP product marketing in it. It is also quite theoretical for example, does not tell me anything about cost of implementing a SAN."
2,Mediocre Introduction to SANs - Lacks Much Needed Detail,"While this book presents a readable introduction to SANs, the level of detail is too simple. An annoying aspect is the constant reference to HP products and solutions. While HP is a player in SANs, there are many other vendors that provide equal or superior alternatives - but of course they are not mentioned. This book could have been summed up in 3 chapters max. A better option would be any of the books on SANs by Clark."
3,Great shoe. Size off.,These are great shoes. However I had to give one pair away because they run a size small. And one is smaller than the other. I have bought two pairs and find that to be true with both.
3,Habit with options,"This product is not as advertised. It is not an authentic Habit and it includes gag headbands, like 4 versions. The material is very thin, not good for a Halloween night in Seattle, Washington. I was hoping for an authentic Mother Superior Habit...a good sign was the price. LOL!!"
5,Complaints about this costume? Nun!,"This costume was needed for a retirement party skit. It arrived in a timely manner and was reasonably priced. The pieces were of the costume were of good quality and fit together easily, right over my street clothes. Everyone was very impressed with how realistic I looked! I wore the headband that said, ""Nun of Your Business"", one of three that were included with the costume. It was really fun and I looked fabulous! When the skit was over, it took me only a few seconds to slip it off and join the party in my regular clothes again. I would definitely recommend this costume to a wannabe nun (a nunnabe?) on a budget!"
4,Great Costume,"This was a great costume. The gown was very roomy and comfortable. I was a little concerned that I had read somewhere that it was a size 14 and that is what size I wear, but there was plenty of fabric. It wasn't clingy at all.The only downside to the costume was the head piece. There didnt' seem to be anything to attach it to your head. There were two straps, but they weren't long enough to tie. I ended up using a safety pin. If there was velcro on the straps that would have made it super easy to attach."
5,Excellent Quality!,"Very pleased with the quality, couldn't ask for a better value and was exactly what I was looking for. This is going to be a hoot, can't wait!!"
5,just perfect!,"This came fast and it's of great quality! Perfect for the price, a little better actually. I am going to enjoy this ;)Happy Halloween!"
1,negative,its just a big old cloak style. i felt like i was more a chris brown costume looking more like a terrorist.
4,Nun Costume,"As it turns out, I didn't have a chance to use the costume but it seems to be well made. Look forward to using it another time."
4,Easy and cheap costume,"The costume was as expected and a good product for the price.For a shorter person such as myself (5'4), the costume was way too long in the arms and at the bottom. The fabric is not hemmed so it's easy enough to cut it down if you need to."
5,snocone maker,our kids love this snocone maker! it's easy to use and just like the stuff at the fair! Just wish we had this years ago!
4,"Book good, description bad","The description here says ""This special edition features a new introduction by the author and a color insert featuring photos and illustration seen here for the very first time!""Yeah, well, it doesn't include the introduction or the color insert.Other than that, I loved the fleshed out story of one of my favorite movies of all time."
2,Too bad software included,"The IEEE-1394 card and cable works fine with my system. It can even be used to connect a notebook with desktop. But the Arcsoft ShowBiz software included in the package is totally a piece of junk.It can download video clips as .avi files in huge size (>2G)from DV to your hard drives. But if you want to transfer these clips into MPEG or other file types, it will quit without any error notice. Sometimes it can churn out a smaller file with extream slow speed, but later you will find out the sound track of your video clip has been seriously biased. It has been slowed down and everything sounds weird with lower frequencies.I don't recommend this product."
2,Maxtor DV Producer,The card caused by PC to never shut down. Maxtor had no clue. I swapped it with my friend's card (different brand) and it worked on his. His worked on mine. The ArcSoft software is OK but tech support is nonexistent.I would not recommend this product..
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!,Do not buy this product. Dansko stopped mnufacturing this shoe because it is defective!! The strap breaks within months of purchase and a pair of Dansko's should last you years.
2,same problem,"I have had similar trouble with the design of these shoes. The elastic strap on one shoe broke within just a couple months. I returned it to the seller who gave me a new pair of shoes. But the same problem occurred again. I absolutely love the style of the shoes and the type leather (I have the brown), but the poor design makes the shoes worthless. They were also extremely uncomfortable to break in."
2,Hard to hear mike,"I got this for my Blackberry Pearl (which required special software to make it work). The stereo sound was OK, but the person I was talking to usually complained about not being able to hear me. And if you're going to have to mess with a wire between the speakers, what's the point of bluetooth. (The magnet was not as cool as I had hoped--no real benefit.) If I weren't so lazy, I'd send it back."
3,"Decent sound, but broken earpiece. Waiting for reply from Customer Service.","I bought this about a month ago, and it worked fine the first time I used it (really, only the first time). The sound was decent, mic didn't seem to have a problem picking up my voice, etc. However, the sound disappeared from the left earpiece shortly thereafter. I noticed that if I applied pressure onto the earpiece (as if crushing it), the sound would work (though it cuts in and out). Not overly pleased about it, so I emailed their customer service today to see what they have to say about this. Will post a follow-up if/when I hear back."
2,Pity,These could have been a great item.PROS:Sound qualitySolid ConnectivityPortableCONS:Not ergonomically created with HUMAN ears in mindNeed duct tape or both hands to keep in earsHeavy
2,It the Fit that Kills In,"I guess I should know better. Maybe my ears are weird, but I can't get a comfortable fit (I have a hard time with in-ear types too). Sound is fine (for Bluetooth), operation is fine, but they just keep falling out."
1,Craptastic,"The UBHS-NC1 pairs flawlessly with my phone and my iPod touch 2G. Unfortunately, that's about the extent of its qualities. The earbuds are poorly designed and no matter what I do they fall off within a few seconds. The microphone is so bad that the phone headset feature is unusable. A complete waste of money."
2,Ghettoized glamor,"This novel holds its place in gay literature only because it appeared early in the development of a relatively new genre. It has an extremely narrow focus that glamorizes a vain and superficial segment of the gay male world, but it functions as such a discovery and elucidation of this world to the reading public that it will probably survive as a document of its times. It was Holleran's first novel and reads like one. I became so impatient with the author's writing style, which seems to consist of lists, that I might not have finished the book but for the seductive sheen of the party circuit in which it occurs."
5,Dancer from the Dance,"On the surface, this book appears to be about homosexual life in NYC and Fire Island before AIDS hit. But it could be about anyone whose life is run (and ruined) by the impossible romantic notion that there is a perfect lover out there waiting to be found. Malone, the central figure of the book, is like Hemingway's Lady Brett, crazy to live life to the brim and to find the love that doesn't (or can't in Lady Brett's case) exist. The book is a classic (I am straight and thought it was as powerful as any novel I have read in a long time).It deserves a five-star rating."
3,Exasperating classic,"Friends had always recommended this work to me, but I'd avoided it, having read Holleran's other work and found it really pretentious, when not sad. I finally gave in. Dancer is exasperating: it is a 70s period piece, yet parts of it apply so succinctly to late 90s gay life, almost as if the AIDS crisis never happened. Unsettling. Parts of the novel are very well-written, but be warned: like all of Holleran's books, there is a lot of purple prose here. And despite my criticism, it is worth reading and deserves its place as a classic."
4,A Sad Angel in Search For Love,"Love, love will tear us apart again and so sung Joy Divison and in this novel Malone is ripped to pieces. Set in the 1970's Manhattan, Dance From The Dance is a rueful testament of the times in the post-Stonewall gay community. Tha main character Malone leaves his cookie-cutter middle upper class WASPish life to become a full time denizen in New York's gay world. It is there that he teams up with Sutherland, the necessary Queen who helps him on his futile, yet honorable, journey to seek love. After running the entire circuit and back Sutherland hooks Malone up with a man he doesn't love but is very rich. In the end Malone escapes once again form his former life once again, but this time he plunges into anonymity. We aren't sure if he is drowned fleeting Fire Island or burned to death at the fire at the bathhouse. Holleran never tells us outright, but it really doesn't matter. Anthony Malone remains the beautiful gay man who is glamorous and tragic."
2,A MASTERPIECE!,"I bought the hardcover release of this when it debuted in 1978 and have read it each year since then. I'm still dazzled by Holleran's unique, breathtaking writing style and, except for Edmund White and his own savvy style, have found no other authors who can mesmerize me so completely. Though my emotional and intellectual reactions have changed over the subsequent 26 years' annual readings and my interpretations, too, have adjusted, this tome is like a family dog--always ready to incite happiness, fascination, and wonderment."
4,Good read.,"This book was very entertaining. I kept me interested all throughout. I was drawn in. There were a few place where I got a tad lost and had to go back and reread a bit, but I was able to quickly recollect myself and continue."
1,DO NOT buy this item,"We bought this exact same popcorn cart from COSTCO ($299) at Christmas. Inside the cart, on the ""roof"" there is a black plastic plate that has 4 screws and holds the top half of the rotating device that then connects to the actual kettle. This plastic platebroke off in little pieces - actually fell into the popcorn. Not realizing it at first, my son actually choked on a piece!We got a replacement cart from COSTCO pretty quickly and the EXACT same thing happened with the second cart. There is obviously a manufacturing defect with this and I do not recommend purchasing it."
3,Thorough but could use a little updating,"Answers most every question you might think up from kill fees to serial rights. I found it very informative, if a little dated with respect to the typewriting references. Does anyone really use one of those anymore? Aside from that, a valuable asset to your writer's library."
5,One of Van's Best,"This album may not be Van's best, but it's very close. Only the title track seems weak to me.Every other song is stong. Lately I seem to like Aryan Mist and Celtic Ray best but some time ago Across the Bridge Where Angels Dwell and She gives me Religion were my favorites. Give the album a spin. You won't be sorry."
4,Full of Atmosphere!,"You often hear discussions about whether a specific album is among the artist's best or weaker releases. In this case I won't go into such a discussion; just note that here you have a terrific voice, some great songs and a lot of atmosphere.My favourite tracks are ""Celtic Ray"", ""Northern Muse"", ""Cleaning Windows"" and ""Vanlose Stairway"""
4,van near top form,"This is one of my favorite cd of van's.I'm not sure why others have given this release a cold shoulder.Some great songs in ""she gives me religeon"" & the title track.But the highlight is ""across the bridge where angel's dwell""this is van's most underrated song of all time,simply great,as is this cd.Buy it!"
3,"Helpful, but Too Many Comparisons to Today","This commentary's strength is in its brevity. You need no more than a few minutes to read each chapter's analysis, and you will come away with a fuller picture of Jeremiah and Lamentations.In my view, that is also one of this commentary's weaknesses. While it adds some fullness, the commentary does not add much in terms of historical background or Hebrew language analysis. It provides one man's understanding of the books, but it is not meant as an academic study tool.In addition, I found that McGee far too often -- at least in his analysis of Jeremiah -- sought to compare the America of his day to the Israelite nation of Jeremiah's. While historical comparisons can be made, I wish that the commentary had focused more on the the two Bible books rather than the historical situation of the commentary's author."
4,Fantastic,"This was my first David Wilcox album and it hooked me right from the first song, ""New World"". I am not too familar with his other works, but this one sort of like folk/pop. His voice is extremely soothing and is sort of similar to James Taylor, but with more lots more emotion (although I love James, too). The backing vocals by Jonatha Brooke and Jennifer Kimball are stunning and very nicely compliment the arrangements. Every song here is good, but my favorites are ""Someday Soon"", ""Break In The Cup"", ""Strong Chemistry"", ""Please Don't Call"", the witty ""Big Mistake"" and his outstanding cover of ""Missing You"". Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys singer/songwriter music lead by an acoustic guitar. You'll be humming all of these songs!!"
5,a must have wilcox album,"I have been a David Wilcox fan for at least 11 years. I have five or six of his albums and this is my absolute favorite. It has the beautiful accoustic guitar, it has some humorous lyrics, it has music that moves you at a sensual level. No matter what mood you're looking for this album can take you there. David Wicox is a poet, a talented guitar player and he has a rich, beautiful, versatile voice. If you're unfamiliar with him, take a chance, you'll never regret it."
5,Dave's Most Commercial Work but Still Surprisingly Good,"Of all of Dave's albums, this one is probably the most commercial in it's feel and sound. Gone, for the most part, are the intricate guitar pieces of the first two albums and the more intimate feel. Normally, this would doom the album but for what I think is Dave's best collection of lyrics on any album he has released.As is often the case with his writing, each song is a story designed to take us beyond the typical pop ""love is great"" theme to something much deeper. As an athlete, my favorite tune is ""Make it Look Easy"" but other than the two covers on the album, I can't think of one I don't like.If you are unfamiliar with folk or have only had the chance to sample the work of James Taylor, this album makes for a great entry point to the genre. The same holds true if you're looking to get a bit more familiar with Dave on your own terms. In any case, be sure to follow this purchase up with ""How Did You Find Me Here""."
4,This CD is a real treat.,"I would recommend all of David's albums. The lyrics and the music are inspired. However, there is no substitute for hearing David perform live. He is a masterful story teller, comedian, and performer. From folk to pop lovers, David has something for everyone."
1,Ocean Surf Interruptus,"You begin listening, and find the sound of the surf very relaxing. ""Ah, this is really nice,"" you say to yourself as you begin nodding off. Suddenly you hear ""AWK! SCREEYAWK!"" It's the sound of screeching seagulls. You fast forward the CD until you find a section without the freaking seagulls. But just as you begin to relax, a fog horn speaks, ""HO-O-O-WONK!"" You sail the CD out the window like a frisbee -- unless, of course, you find the sound of gulls and foghorns -- uh, relaxing."
4,Excellent Resource,"Required reading for a doctorate level class, but a textbook that I enjoyed reading. The writers weave ""real world"" examples throughout the text that provides the reader with a reference point for the application of theories. There are many visual examples throughout the text that assist the adult learner with understanding the concepts being delivered within each chapter."
2,Big mistake on first page!,"Given that the first page of the first chapter has a glaring mistake, I have to wonder how many others exist in this book... Not an auspicious beginning. There is no such song as ""One Enchanted Evening"". Some Enchanted Evenong would have been the song sung at the convocation described on that first page. Why don't people check their facts before publishing?"
2,Disappointing,"It was rather a disappointing read given the 4-5 star ratings given by earlier readers. There is a reasonable historical coverage of the life and times of the Irish, however, I was looking for more details regarding her exploits and tactics in battle, in particular, her strategic use of Clew Bay."
1,Are you joking?,"I haven't read this book yet but I'm really put out about the price of the ebook - $12.99??? I can buy a used paperback book for $3.00 and a new one for $10.00. These people need to come back down to earth and realize if they want to sell a product, the price needs to be reasonable."
4,looks good,"It looks good once it is all said and done. Im a carpenter and could have built it for about a 1/4 the price. Very simple, and made of laminated partical board with glass int he middle. looks nice and the tv fit well in the groove made of the top."
4,Pricey for a stand but nice,"Really sturdy and nice; the center shelf is glass too. A bit pricey but worth it for me; there is enough room on the shelves for my Dish HD-DVR, reciever, Blu-ray player, center speaker and more.4/5 stars just because of the price."
1,talk about buyers remorse...,"I'm a welder fabricator by trade, I was planning on building a stand for my 65"" Mitsu and should have stuck with my original plan.The Good:Color is perfectTHE BAD:Top shelf sags/bows with the weight of the TV on it.The other two shelves are not wide enough to put three components across. In other word if you want to put three componads on one shelf you have to stack two of them.Took over two weeks to get here from Amazon.Sits directly on the floor, it's missing feet.Did I mention that the top shelf bows.Because of the bow on the front of the top shelf the screen is now slightly angled downwards.I had to give it one star beacuse the was no zero or negitave."
5,What a Glorious Find!,I was so happy to find these on Amazon....and the fact that they were a great deal was even better. My family is reading through them as part of our devotional time. Great series that documents the life and dedication of a man clearly chosen by God.
5,powerful and challenging books,"When I first heard of William Branham, I was given the first 3 books back in England in 98 and was thoroughly amazed with the way God raised up this man of God. Its hard to put down the book when you start. THere are many early experiences he had which capture your interest and attention. The first one can be read very quick, but by then your drawn in to the mans life and his triumphs and tragedies. Its a must read if you are open minded spiritually and humble hearted before God. Before that I had read of Wigglesworth and the Welsh revivalists, but nothing like this. This man did indeed pray for kings and dignitaries like God said he would. Look up (google) the healing of congressman Upshaw, for instance and see what a miracle that was."
4,INTERESTING INFORMATION,"Allthough some of the information has, since it's publication, been proven untrue, this book is an interesting one for the Titanic Enthusiast. The information presented shows what the Titanic's brief life was like for her passengers and crew and offers background information on these people."
5,Great single cup tea infuser that really works!,So easy a child can use it.1. Twist the ball to separate2. Place the plunger in the lower half3. Load in the dry tea leaves4. Twist the two halfs back together5. Place in hot water for 2-3 mins. then remove all the tea flavor by pulling up on the plunger while holding top half.Great gadget!
2,I wanted to like these infusers,"The pictures make this product seem very sturdy, but in reality, they are not. There are too many moving pieces and it's very confusing. The wire drop is fairly flimsy, plus the blue plastic stopper on the top of the infuser almost always ends up floating in my tea, which worries me when the plastic is in my boiling tea. Because of the wire drop, the little tea cozy that is provided to hold the infuser after being used is not very useful - the infuser mostly just falls over. Also, the holes in the infuser for steeping the tea are too large, and particles escaped in almost every cup of tea I made."
3,"Ok, but not that small","Functionally, this tea infuser is ok. My complaint is that it is not that small. It sizes like a small egg. I have some little tea cups that is smaller than mugs and when I put this infuser in the little tea cups... it looks like a small boy eating a huge hotdog with his mouthfull. For those people in the category of LAZY, stay with teabags. Washing of this thing is not a brainer but still far more efforts than just a tossing a teabag away."
2,I Only Like The Environmental Sounds.,"Ths was a CD I got when I was younger, it's one of those things you either buy or get as a present and it's ok once but than the novelty wears off! You have to really be into sound effects, otherwise it is kind of boring, really the only sound effects I like are the environmental sounds."
3,If you like Douglas Adams...,"...you'll probably enjoy this book quite a bit. It has a very ""young Adams"" feel to it, in the style of humour and the author's tendency to personify inanimate objects in amusing asides. I laughed out loud in several places. The premise is clever and is revealed in layers, so every time you think you've figured out, ""Oh, this is what it's about, ok, it's going in this direction,"" some new piece of the puzzle changes the course. I have to say, I thought the ending dragged out a bit too long, and the wording is awkward in a couple places, but for a first effort by a self-published author, it's impressive. In short, if you enjoyed the ""Hitchhiker's Guide"" series, this is worth a look."
3,DO NOT PAY LIST PRICE FOR THIS!,"I caught this on sale for $14.20 + S&H; and it's a good thing I did! It only opens on the narrow end and closes with velcro. You have to slide the chimes in as if you were putting them into a sock, holding the case open with one hand while holding the chimes together with the other. The whole time you're trying to prevent the chimes from getting tangled or caught outside the case.If I had paid full price for this thing it would be going back!"
1,Terrible product,"I wanted a dongle 1394 card because I have a wireless card, but this product was terrible. The dongle did not release properly from the card, and as a result the dongle and card became damaged. Also could not get my W2K computer to properly recognize my iPod through this device. Had no problem on my desktop. Don't buy this unless you are a glutton for punishment."
5,Live Lo' Jo,"I first got to hear Lo' Jo in Central Park at a live concert. Although I love all their music, this live recording brings back that experience like nothing else. Denis Pean's lyrics and the wonderful winding world music are incomparable. See them in live performance if you have the opportunity! Otherwise, this is a good introduction to all that is Lo' Jo."
1,COMPLETLY wrong AVOID,Item in box did not match labeling or documentation. Item Not as advertised. No way to return item. All attempts to contact seller failed.
4,A former LAPD Officer who was there,Want to know what's wrong with the LAPD today? Read this book. Chief Vernon's first hand account of what went wrong provides tremendous insight into the destructive power of political correctness and and the political power struggles that destroyed the finest law enforcement agency in the world! Well written in a self-depricating and winsome style. A prophetic look at the future of big city municiple law enforcement. A must read for any police officer considering a career as a Law Enforcement Executive.
2,"Smaller than I thought, but will do the job I guess","Thought these were larger. I can make small cannoli with this. This company should make larger ones, cannot find them anywhere."
3,Meh.,"I've used both these forms and wooden dowels, and frankly, I like the dowels better.Dowels release the shells more easily, however they do float a little more in the hot oil (which is a problem), and absorb some oil as well.The metal forms do work, and I find them to be a reasonable size, though I wouldn't mind seeing them be 1mm wider."
2,Cannoli Pastry Forms,Was very disappointed with this purchase. The Cannoli Pastry Forms are too small. They should be larger to allow you to fill the shells. Size does matter in this case!
4,Just what I needed!,Everyone was thrilled with the cannolis I made. It is the perfect product. What more can I say about this product. Great!
4,Excellent Cannoli,The cannoli forms worked quite well. I used the recipe on the back of the package. I was impressed with the results.
2,Wrong advertised size,I purchased these because they were described as being one inch in size. They are clearly not! They might be a fine product but the description is wrong and should be revised!
3,great product for good food...,this is a great product that I bought for my mother whom loves cannolis and loves baking stuff that we as a family can eat.
5,norpro m3660 stainless steel connoli forms,bought these connoli forms for my son's girlfriend who is a baker. She makes beautiful cakes and wants to broaden her baking experiences. Can't wait to try them!
5,Cannoli Tubes Are GREAT,These cannoli tubes worked great for us. This was our first time making cannoli's and we had no problems at all. There is a recipe on the back of the package and it worked great.
5,Excellent Product,"I purchased two sets of the Cannoli Forms, they are excellent! works perfectly and having 8 helps me knock out the Cannoli even faster! Love this product! Arrived ahead of time and in perfect working condition!Norpro 3660 Stainless Steel Cannoli Forms, Set of 4"
2,Russian attempt at a western action movie,"To me it seems like this movie makes a leap for movies such as Snatch or any of the other Guy Richie classics however it misses pretty bad. The dialogue and acting and very clunky. The humor, in an attempt to be dark and edgy turns out to be unnecessarily crude and coarse.Overall I'd say skip this one and check out Narkoman Pavlik on youtube if you want some quality new-russian comedy."
1,Cheap Material...,"Wow... I wasn't expecting much from this, considering the price, yet they still somehow managed to let me down. The material is already frayed, straight out of the packaging. Looks exactly like one of those black robes that you'd get with a ghost costume, only they grudgingly stitched in a crappy collar. Would not buy from this manufacturer again."
3,decent,Fairly decent quality for the low price. Material was thin and almost see through. Disappointing that it did not come with a rosary. My husband liked how simple it was.
2,Not worth it,"This costume is just a cheap piece of fabric, I would've been better off buying a couple of yards of fabric and sewing them together myself. The fabric is super light and see through."
4,Pretty good for what you pay for and simple.,"The material is thin and cheap, but not bad at all. The neck collar offers plenty of room so you don't choke. Overall, for under $18 with shipping, it's a worthwhile buy for something that I'll probably only ever wear once."
5,Great Resource,This book is one of the best of its type that I have seen. A very handy reference for anyone doing documentation.
5,A Reformation Debate,"Excellent and very promt service. The book arrived in excellent condition as advertized, and well ahead of schedule."
5,Classical Liturgical,"This is stunning liturgical music, with several variations of a few of the Shabbat favorites (HaTikvah, Ve'ahavta, etc.). The chorus is remarkable, and the soloists bring tears to my eyes. And yet no one and no instruments stand out above the music itself. I highly recommend this CD, and I will be buying several more copies to give as gifts."
3,"Fabulous music, but problems with the recording","The selections, arrangements, and performances are all first-rate. However, the recording was made in the ""Great Hall"", and that's quite obvious: a lot of echo, and the feeling that you're in the back of a very large hall. The cuts available online will show you exactly what I mean."
3,Too Churchy....Not Jewish Enough,"This is a short comment, but the whole album is too slow and is VERY Churchy....it is just not Jewish enough for my blood. The organ and the echo sound is not my style. If you like Christian sounding music, then this just might be for you. As for the quality of what it is, it is very good, provided that you like that type of thing. I gave it three stars....but it just isn't Jewish enough sounding."
3,"Sometimes over the top, sometimes right on target","After reading this book, I ask myself ""Why?"". Why must we have a Me Inc.? Why must we doggedly pursue a vision of WOW projects, constant re-invention and innovation? If I don't I'll suffer substandard pay, my children won't be able to eat and my mortgage will foreclose?Madness I say. A cultural aberration created by a ficticious requirement to have more and more and more and more, of what? For what? Perhaps I missed the chapter, but I don't recall one word on ""value of life"". It was just chase, chase, chase, chase. Like an addiction. Dogs do this when you throw them a ball don't they? However, even a dog eventually gets tired of the purposless repetition.I thoroughly enjoyed the book, however consider it to be a classic example of how fundamentally insane our western culture is. Everyone should read it!"
2,"Every wonder why no volume @""","Have you ever wonder why there is no volume tow or three of this book? There is no there. The book makes a promise and then doesn't deliver. The stuff in this book is so basic and easy that there is no way you will play like Jimi when you get through it. Very thin stuff and material. Song are not really arranged. Get if for a joke or for a really small kid, but if you want to get serious get something else."
1,was working good but only for 2 days,unit cut off and wont come on at all nownow i have to be stuck in the cold :(
4,great little space heater that is cheap to operate,Great little personal space heater. I use it in my office where it keeps me very comfortable. It costs less than 1/2 as much $$ to run as a normal full size quartz heater. It's only real drawback is the fact that it is extremely bright. It would be better is they used red colorized halogen elements rather then the clear.
3,not safe near bedding,good heater but unsafe near bedding....my dog dragged a pillow next to heater and it started on fire.....luckily i was there to put it out before it spread....
3,It's a nightlight!,It's too bright that its light up a hold room and that it do to make noise. Don't last long!!
3,Informative,"This is a look at Jayne Mansfield through the words of one of her husbands Mickey Hargitay. This is interesting as well as informative, especially if you are into old movie stars. Good luck trying to find a copy. My parents had a copy lying around."
2,Battery died within the first week,"Cute watch, but I have hardly worn it since the batteries ran out in 3 days. Considering how much you pay for the watch, you'd think they would give you a new battery!!"
5,"A ""Must Get"" CD !!!!","How does one begin to review a CD that is so uplifting and inspiring? This CD is a true testament to the awesome talent and faithfulness of Bishop Morton. My favorite selections are, Reason Enough, Storm Chaser, and If You Could See Me Now. Bishop Morton was my mother's pastor. I was honored and privileged to hear him sing If you Could See Me Now at her funeral. It brought me great comfort. I totally recommend this entire CD, and for anyone who has lost a loved one, I especially recommend selection #14, If You Could See Me Now . It will indeed lift your spirit and help you move on knowing that those who have left us are ""in ä better place""."
1,Very crude,I love this type of movie but they have all gotten too crude with the sexual humor. I threw it away after watching it.
1,Force to watch Commercials!,"This DVD forces you to watch commercials and previews including ""Bring it on the Musical""!ARRGGGGGThere are so many adds. Adds for the concept of bluray technology, horrible movies, digital services, they just don't stop.Six minutes and 30 seconds of my life wasted on drivel.The following DVD controls are disabled during the preview:FastforwardChapter ForwardTop MenuAdvanceCuriously rewind is supported.Just not worth the hassle for this B movie."
4,"Stupid, but very entertaining!","If you are the type of person that likes a movie which makes you think; ""your highness"" is not for you.The movie is pretty stupid, but I honestly had a lot of entertainment. I recommend if you want to get some laughs."
2,Just not that funny.,"I don't really know why but I just couldn't laugh at this, and this is coming from someone that likes Norbit. Obviously my standards are not that high. There is just no original humor, no redeeming story. It's as though they feeling adding a curse to a sentence makes it funny. The effects are good and Natalie Portman is alright in it. But for the most part the jokes just felt old I think. For example in one scene a bowl cut is compared to a penis. Stuff most of us heard in middle school. If comedy is all about timing I think this movie came out 10 years too late for me."
2,Wack....,"I like every kind of comedy, this was pretty bad though.Had its moments but all in all pretty bad."
1,Worst movie ever,"I saw ""Your Highness"" in the theater and it is the first time I ever walked out on a movie before it was over. I don't have high standards and I have sat through some stinkers.The writing and jokes were lame, the plot drearily predictable. The actors McBride and Franco were sleepwalking through their roles. Even seeing Natalie Portman naked from behind was not enough to overcome how bad this movie was and keep me in the theater.This movie was so bad that I am compelled to write a review - something I very rarely do - telling you how bad it was."
1,Words don't come to mind,"this movie was just so ridiculous the jokes was just disgusting i watched the whole thing thinking it will get better but just got more disgusting by the minute i really wasted my time looking at this movie. How the hell James Franco and Natalie Portman agree to do this crappy movie, well that is just my opinion. Worst movie i saw in a very long time."
1,Biggest Stink Bomb of all time!,"I cannot tell you how much I regret having spent money on this horrible stinker of a movie. I enjoy a bit of low brow humor now and then, but this film seemed to have been put together for a very specific demographic: male, poor white trash - the kind of people who drive pick up trucks with big fat wheels, have guns (and go ""huntin""), don't wash on a regular basis, can't hold down jobs or hold a decent conversation. What astounds me is how they managed to talk a couple of decent actresses into even being in this thing!! Frankly, this movie is SO bad, it makes Ishtar look like Casablanca. And I never thought anything could be as bad as Ishtar. The people involved in greenlighting this film, producing it, and ""directing"" it, should be tarred and feathered and dumped in some horrible nasty place where they can't bother people with such dreck anymore."
1,f*&#ing stupid,"There are so many f bombs that if we had just used the movie to count them, it just might have made up for an insipid plot, poor acting and total lack of humor. Wow, this is a stinker!"
1,Rubbish,"What a complete and utter waste of money. Who in their right minds creates such rubbish. I think I got no more than 10mins into the video and decided to delete the entire thing. Wish I could get my money back, but then I I need to pay the fine for been stupid enough to think that there might be something interesting and fun to watch. Looks like only the crude and vulgar would think this is funny. Do not expose your intellect to this movie. If you do, then I understand your ....AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE!!"
1,"Sad, sad chuck of a movie.","For once, the trailer for a new comedy didn't spoil the best bits.Unfortunately, that's because there aren't any.A textbook example of ye olde two-joke movie --and beneath those two jokes,there's precious little else to fall back on.Basically, the script, from the title on down,feels like something sketched out on rolling papers.This film made no money and that's for a reason.it cost $80 million to make it it only made $20 million.it's a waste of time.If you really must see this thing rent it. You have been warned."
1,Not very happy,"I put it in my machine and it doesn't play at all, I don't have any problems with my other tapes, but this is absolutely useless to me. I didn't open it until january so it is too late to send back, but I will not buy from this company again.."
2,pathetic,"I am not sure what target audience this film is aimed at but someone should have thought about that before making it. You cannot take a kid to it and most grown ups I hope would want something a bit more intelligent.The problem here is while I do admit to swearing a fair bit and being an Aussie used to hearing this language still unlike what I am sure is the producers' intent, I do not find it funny the use of these words. The jokes are I think crude and not witty. Almost always they have a sexual connotation which did nothing for me.The acting except for Natalie Portman's effort I found bad. Having said that I doubt she is the right person to cast in a sword and sorcery movie as a fighter. She does not look the part.The actual filming is good. The special effects quite good.Still, I would suggest giving it a miss."
5,Not for the soccer mom,"loved itisn't it amazing how he can talk and * my * at the same exact timeStephen, I'm going to put you in the corner *now* while I strum my filthies."
4,Recieved Very Quickly,Item was shipped very quicklyReceived very quickly Item was sufficiently packagedMovie is one of those that are of a comical typeIf you enjoy stupid Humor you will enjoy this
2,"Unfortunately, just not very funny :'(","Let me start by saying I am a huge Danny McBride fan, I love Eastbound & Down, and I thought Pineapple Express was hilarious. Unfortunately, Your Highness just wasn't very funny. It tried hard to be, you could obviously tell where you should have been laughing, but it just failed to deliver. Medieval theme + crude humor could have equaled hilarious, but it simply was not pulled off in this movie."
1,What a Grand Disappointment!!!,"If you are expecting an innocent, tongue-in-cheek, goofy comedy, you had better look elsewhere!This has to be the most offensive, sexually perverted comedy I have ever seen! There is one scene where they go to see a wizard for guidance on the quest. The wizard offers to help if they kiss him on the lips and masturbate him, which they do! It is also revealed that one of the heroes has been molested by the wizard since he was a little boy - all presented in a humorous way, of course!This is just one example, but the movie is filled with this nonsense from beginning to end! The dialogue is continually sexual in nature, with a lot of emphasis on homosexual themes.Hey, if that's your thing you'll love this movie. I not only find this perverted, homosexual, and child molesting humor sickening, I think that it should come with one helluva warning label!As for me I gave it one star, only because ""negative five"" was not an option... {BARF}"
4,"Not an epic classic, but a whole lot of ribald fun!","On a lark I saw this with a long time friend of mine. We were laughing our heads off, laughing so hard we hurt.Really funny, there were KIDS in the audience. But the kids got the nasty jokes too! Wonder if their parents told them later any ""Wizard"" offers them a special leaf in exchange for ""Fun"" to tell them so they can ""negotiate"" with the shotgun;-)Frankly, this movie is what I WISH could have been made in the 80s. It reminded me quite lovingly of good classic but FAMILY movies, Dark Crystal, Labyrinth, etc. I'd like to see more along this line, like a sequel to Sword and the Sorceror, lots of good and NON-FAMILY NON-PC and well acted/good effects fantasy movies. There's too much PC drek out there without the fun and wonder."
1,Worst movie of the years,"This was one of the most unfunny movies of the year. I bought the movie because of Natalie Portman and James Franco and because I also love spoofs on the whole genre like Mel Brooks ""Robin Hood, Men in Tights."" But this movie is just bad, boring, gross and unfunny."
2,Wanna be funny but I cannot,"This movie tries soo hard to be funny but it cannot provide more then few rare smiles. It had the potential, meaning being funny without making fun of an actual movie, a spoof. How can you make the movie funny with a single idea? A lazy, unatractive guy, always envies his almost gay brother because of his success in life. One joke....where is the rest? make it a physical comedy, I will follow and agree. but this movie was not. Unrated version had few female flesh flashed to you and very, very vulgar language, there you have unrated movie. Do not waste your movie to buy it. Use some of those vending machines to get a $1 movie or use Amazon.com instant video Honestly, you will waste your 17 dollars with this movie."
2,How To Take a Good Story and Trash it,"This could have been a really great movie along the lines of Princess Bride in more capable hands, but instead it was filled with gross humor and bad acting to drown what could have been a good story/movie. To describe the amounts of utter stupidity would be a waste, the fact that the ""hero"" was an idiot would be giving him more credit than deserved. I think my IQ dropped 10 points while watching this movie. Let me be clear, if you think cutting off a monster's penis to wear around your neck is good fun, this is your movie."
1,Really?,"This was the stupidest film I have ever had to watch. I forced a slight grin to appear. Not for kids or for human consumption. Natalie what the heck? 'Year One' pulled the gag film better than this film could.Had I invested money into the making of this film I would be pissed off. If Amazon allowed negative 20 stars I would gladly give it that, just for some of the effects."
1,Zero Stars,This is not a movie. It's just a bunch of boring video of miserable acting. A huge insult to the viewing public.
1,worst movie ever,this is the dumbest movie i have ever seen i only watched 40 mins of it and i was wishing i was high so i could just forget what i seen. do not bother getting this movie save your money for something more important like fertilizer because this movie stinks just as much.
1,David Gordon Green come BACK TO US?!!!,FLAT OUT AWFUL. ONE OF THE WORST FILMS I HAVE EVER SEEN BY ONE OF THE GREATEST DIRECTORS OF OUR TIME??!! David Gordon Green NEEDS to walk away from HOLLYWOOD's $$$$$ and all this toilet junior high humor and make films that MATTER. I respect him with all my heart but it was torture sitting through this drek. HORRIBLE. SAD. WASTED TALENT. SO BAD I CAN'T BELIEVE I WANT TO PURCHASE IT JUST TO HEAR THIS MASTER'S COMMENTARY. HE IS A GENIUS. THIS IS TRASH.
4,A blast,"A disappointing box office return may find the destiny of Your Highness as being a future cult classic, which is somewhat disappointing in itself considering that it's a hilarious blast for its whole running time. Pineapple Express director David Gordon Green re-unites with co-stars Danny McBride and James Franco, as they play a pair of princes that embark on a quest to save Franco's wife to be (Zooey Daschenel) from an evil wizard (Justin Theroux). Along the way they come across a series of hilariously violent misadventures, as well as team up with a gorgeous warrior (Natalie Portman). I don't want to say much else about the film, for fear that it will spoil the ridiculously funny exploits that unfold throughout. Granted that Your Highness is definitely not something for everyone, but for what it's worth, this film is a hoot. All in all, leave your brain and inhibitions at the door for Your Highness, and you'll have a smoke-filled blast the whole way through."
3,"Vulgar train wreck... So, you were expecting Shakespear?","Like a train wreck, which I have only seen on the news, it is hard to not watch once you notice it. Having paid to see it, we had to stick it out. It has some good laughs, but if I had known more about it I would not have bothered.I can't say I didn't like it... much. It's just that there were a bunch of moments where I was contemplating turning it off, but felt compelled to see what was coming next. So, three stars because I stayed with it to the end."
2,"Watch, but don't buy...","I really like the cast of this movie, but I was SO disappointed when I finished watching it. The best parts were shown in the previews/trailers. I know it's supposed to be a fun, not-serious movie, but I felt like I wasted 2 hours of my life after watching. Try renting first, and if you like it, purchase."
1,If I could give it zero stars I would,"Horrible HORRIBLE movie. My husband, who normally lives for dumb movies like this, turned it off after 15 min. Dont waste your money or brain cells on this"
3,Skips But that's fine,"I recieved it at the exact time it was to arrive in, but the dvd skips three times during the middle of the dvd but it's fine."
4,Not the best but well worth the time,"It's nothing special, but it delivers on the premise and offers up a number of genuine laughs. I was a bit worried when I saw the poor to average reviews, but all in all I'm glad that I watched it. Low expectations may have helped. One gag in particular was priceless."
3,Too bad I wasn't high while watching this,"I had high (pun intended?) hopes for this medieval stoner comedy since I thought Pineapple Express was pretty good and you have the likes of Natalie Portman, James Franco and Danny McBride in the lead roles. There were a few scenes that got some laughs out of me and the crowd I saw it with, most of them the vulgar sort (this earned it's R rating many times over with more than expected levels of gore, the expected high dosage of foul language and a little nudity thrown in for good measure), but overall the silly fantasy action element didn't mesh with the comedy. Some scenes were just really, really bad, while others were mildly amusing. Still, it's far from terrible and it might be worth a rental if you are in the right state of mind...if you know what I mean.2 and 1/2 out of 5 stars (but I'll be nice and round up)"
1,Not a kid movie,"It is entertaining for a b movie, however towards the end a guardian evil bull was in the movie with a two foot full shaped penis, if that wasn't bad enough then the guy cut it off and wore it as a necklace for the rest of the movie. IF you can swallow that you may be mildly entertained."
1,Ok...so I hate it,"THE stupidest movie I have EVER EVER watched. And I am a big movie buff. Natalie Portman? I thought I could always depend on you? Just plain stupid! I think whoever had this idea was trying to make fun of this era of movies, which I love. I did find myself laughing at the stupidity of it all. The reference to sex ever five seconds was just too much. Do not watch unless you feel like throwing your money away."
2,Good for One Watch at Most; Drink First!,"At most, YOUR HIGHNESS is good for one watch. The humor is crude and not all that funny. I can only take so many penis and fart jokes before I get bored. The plot is a spoof on every medieval fantasy-quest story ever made, but that was the point, and the end is loaded with special effects that aren't very special. McBride and Franco tried to add humorous delivery to not-so-humorous lines, and Portman gave us her best buxom badass babe impression. In the end, I only laughed at this because I'm a complete fantasy nerd, and even then I found myself ready for the credits. Some great one-liners, a few good funnies, but otherwise a pass. Maybe if I'd had a few drinks..."
3,Fun,"This movie wasn't quite what I expected, but did not really disappoint. There was a ton of crude humor and an uncomfortable moment with a pedophiliac creature. The crude humor was perfectly timed though and the movie was a laugh the whole way through. James Franco, Danny McBride and Natalie Portman were all fantastic and it was nice seeing Franco and Portman in something fun and ridiculous like this. I definitely recommend this movie, if you're looking for a good laugh."
4,A Ripping Ribald Yarn,"I think poor marketing and critical indifference led to this film's failure to find it's audience at the box office. The title led you to believe that this was Cheech and Chong go Medieval. There are a few instances of imbibing the herb but for the most part it's a rousing action-adventure comedy. James Franco, Danny McBride, and Natalie Portman are engaging and the effects are pretty good. Not classic stuff but it's endearing enough for undiscriminating viewers to give it a toke."
5,Playfull secrets....,Lmao danny mcbride james franco and natalie portman...who would have thought these 2 would make such afunny movie...you have to be able to take the movie for what it is...there is so much reality in life that its to a point where I dont want it in amovie...well this quest is perfect!!! Laughed alot...way funny watch it..then watch it again and lower your expectations and enjoy..a wonderful addition to our collection!!!
4,Funny.,"I really liked the movie and found it very funny. If you have young children or are uncomfortable with blue(adult) humor, you may wnat to pass this movie by."
2,Good cast. Bad movie.,"This is not the worst movie, it's just that with a cast like this, I was expecting it to be, well, at least good. It had a few (and far between) chuckles, but was certainly not the HIGH times you'd expect. It simply wasn't very funny. I attribute that to a weak script more than on any failing of the actors."
4,funny,If you thought pineapple express was funny then you'll definitely laugh a lot throughout this film.... very funny... I recommend it
3,Raunchy but mostly funny,Enough sex jokes to keep a 13 year old boy happy. But I was happy to go back to my to my own raunchy sexy joke days for a couple of hours.
1,"could have been worse, but not by much",This movie was an incredible waste of an hour and a half of my life. The only thing worth watching was the 15-20 seconds of seeing Natalie Portman in a skimpy outfit. The only way this movie could have been worse is if Uwe Boll directed it and Will Ferrell starred in it (although as bad as it was I had to check and make sure Uwe Boll didn't direct it). Do yourself a favor and pass this one by. Save your money.
5,Much Love,"There was in the order of my DVD's with Sams Store 247, that he is a man that stands behind his word. He correct the matter in a order manner of time. So, the only I will say that in the near future. That if I have any product (DVD, CD, etc) I will not hesitate to put an order to his store. Because he have displayed a highly performance what a business man suppose be. To be able to stand behind his name an word. Thank you I will continue to do business with you any time. If you ever need anyone to stand in your corner for anything feel free and text me. I will do it with a pleasure."
1,sad,good potential....done in by its extreme crudity. In my opinion extreme language and crudity are attempts at cheap humor and is not funny. This movie fails in so many ways.
2,Used - Really used!,"I knew it was a used book but I didn't expect the pages to be falling out. Can't open the book without more page coming out. However, the photos are ok and that was what I was interested in. Am also told this is a classic on the subject."
5,A Must Read!,"This book was recommended to me by a friend and I am so glad I purchased it and read it from cover to cover. It's one of those books that you must find out what happens next--""The Can't Put It Down"" type of reading. Every young woman must read this book. What a testimony of how God can restore a shattered life and how important it is to wait on Him before picking a mate. I made sure both of my girls purchased the book. I was so blessed by this book that I had her to come to a retreat I held to sell and sign her books. What a blessing and what a beautiful young woman. It's also a good reading for older women too. It shows just how God can make a significant difference in your life regardless of the mistakes of the past."
4,Star Trek: Birth of the Federation Startegy Guide for PC,"The Star Trek Birth of the Federation Strategy Guide is a very useful comprehensive book that outlines strategies for winning and goes more in depth than the booklet that came with the game. It offers a complete listing of the ships and their strengths and also offers information on all structures, races, and charts on game effects and point systems for what each action is worth. Cheat codes and tips are also offered. Definately worth the price."
3,STTNG:BotF falls short in most categories,"I only give this book three stars because the information contained within is mostly things that you would already know about; how to explore a galaxy? Come on! My 2-year old could figure that out. Yet they give it 17 pages (Stellar Cartography, Ch. 7 and Exploration, Ch. 8) which is just stuff that you already know, if you've played this game. The book is about 50% full of charts giving you specific info on each and every structure in the game. That does help a little. Also, the Tactical Combat chapters and the Production chapters will give you some good insight into how best to proceed in each area. And that's about it. I was upset because I don't think I got my money's worth with this product. If it was only 9.99, I think I would have. But not for 17.99."
3,"A Good Author, A Bad Publisher","I got this book because I got a promotional certificate from an online bookstore (not this one). They didn't yet have many books and nothing caught my eye except this one.The author is very knowledgeable about Trek, you can tell that. And he played this game all the way through multiple times. What makes this book drek is two things, first his editor must have been blind since there are spelling errors, grammatical error all over the place (okay not that many but enough to notice). Second I could tell that he played a beta version of the game. And there were noticeable changes between the version he played and the version I bought. When I went to the Brady website to ask about things (okay to complain) it was ""under construction"".Overall an okay book by a knowledgeable Trek fan and game put out by an abismal publisher."
1,Incredibly Terribly Horrible!!!,This was probably the worst strategy guide I have ever seen. This was not a guide but a way to escape hving to think up your own strategies.
5,The Best Straegy guide for a game around,This book is real good with the game and doese it credit a good bu
5,Great Stain,Found this product to be excellent. I did not have any problem with it. It covers well even with one coat.
2,rambling and trite,"A rambling book, not very informative, with a marked liberal tone. Not to mention disjointed-- as far as the editorial content goes, each chapter is a totally separate book with its own thesis. I would have preferred a more cohesive work supported by the weight of objective historical evidence rather than repetitive tales of coffee house chats, anarchic newspapers, and loud-mouthed ideologues -- written in a soporific stream of consciousness."
5,Fast but Ugly,"Not really a 'Toy'...""Zip Kicker"" will set Super Glue(s) ""instantly""!Use the Zip Kicker with great caution as the instant set gives off hot-heat and a small cloud of fumes. Zip Kicker will ""craze"" all clear/hard plastics, so do not use for pretty joins.Test on some scrap material if you can.Good Luck."
2,What you really need is Whittaker and Watson.,"Why spend money on books like this when nearly everything can be found in Whittaker and Watson's masterpiece ""A Course of Modern Analysis?"" Instead of pussyfooting around your phobia of classical analysis and special functions, crush and conquer it by actually working through W & W now.PS. ""A Course of Modern Analysis"" is in fact CHEAPER!!"
3,STORY TIME,"I was suprised when I first started reading this book. It was not the usual step by step chapters on facts and rules. This was a story of a women who found herself in the position of needing to learn a lot in a small amount of time. So she goes to a golf club and talks with several of the people that work there. Each person she talks with teaches her something specific. When she is with the grounds keeper she learns about the course. The club maker teachers her about the different kind of clubs. What they are made of, which are best for a beginner. And what each one is made of. there is also a lot of history thrown in. How the first clubs, & balls were made etc. the last chapter is a glossery of terms: par, birdie, eagle, and many I've never heard of. It reads like a story. All the topic's in the title were covered, and I did learn a lot from this book that I did not know, and it didn't put me to sleep doing it."
1,DVD only plays in certain players......,"The DVD you make won't play in ALL DVD players like the one you buy. I made a copy of the Godfather to watch with friends. I tested it on my DVD player and it worked. I took it to some friends' house and it wouldn't play in their player. What good is a DVD if it won't play in DVD players like any other DVD? Calling this a back up copy is claiming something it isn't. If it won't play like the original, then what good is it? Also, it takes two DVDs to make a DVD of ONE movie. Who wants to get up and switch the DVD every time you are getting into the story? This software is not worth the price. Wait until they come up with one that will work on ALL DVD players. It doesn't make any sense that they wouldn't. The ORIGINAL you are copying will play on all of them...why not the copy?"
1,Not a good deal!!,"I bought a pre-issue version of ""DVD X Copy"", as of now I wouldn't advise anyone to buy this product. It is not supported on a Windows 98 platform. Every time I try to backup a DVD the computer locks up. Product support is not there for any kind of help at all. When I asked for help the only answer I got back, was to post my problem in their chat room and maybe there would get back to me. All I can say is LET THE BUYER BEWARE !!!!"
2,It works...but definately NOT an exact copy.,"If you really want an exact copy, try CloneDVD. DVDXcopy will by default put an extra track containing the warning about copy right. And you cannot get rid of it. It is extremely annoying after a while. CloneDVD is as easy to use and it give you the option of keeping the menu other than dropping what you don't need. The bottom line is, DVDXcopy works without giving you much choice."
5,Worth every penny,"I was very skeptical of DVD backup software. Most require you to download several freeware witha guide (Stay away from DVD wizard pro) This is absolutely fantastic. Very simple to use and much faster than most software. I should say that I downloaded the 1.5 version which did not recognize my DVD R drive, but the 1.4 worked fine. Video and audio quality is excellent, and the format is preserved including the titles, just like the original. My DVD drive is Toshiba which is not supported usually by this software, but luckily for me it worked well. Mine is Toshiba SD-R 6012. It worked well with 1.4 version. Technical support was good and wait time was short."
1,What Tech Support?,"Just read the review about the person who contacted tech support on Saturday? No way. 321 Studios has never responded to any of my inquiries, nor can I get ahold of their supposed tech support. Do yourself a favor. Find another product. You simply do not get the promised tech support. As for the usefulness of the product, I recommend that you carefully consider what is written in the reviews. Although I was skeptical of a company ""planting"" reviews, some of these reviews are just too glowing in their praises. My experience with 321 Studio products is that they promise quite a bit more than they actually deliver."
1,321 Studios DVDxcopy Platinum,"I bought DVDXcopy Platinum retail box at CompUSA for [money].take it home and install on my PC using Windows XP Pro.Intel 1.8 MHz 1gb.mem and Pioneer A06 DVD+R.Open the program try to copy the DVD movie WaterWorld, first I used the advanced to copy, it's was seem going good for about [less money]and then free up for over 2 minutes at last it open the DVD writer and eject out! FAILED ???, second I try the Express just want to make copy of the movie only, and that happen same thing again!!! BAD BAD BAD !!! Lost my $$$ and Times plus 2 TDK DVD+R X4 blanks. Trask this DVDxCopy Platinum.I can not return to the store because the software have been open box, if you not buy this software yet! don't buy this DVDxcopy Platinum"
2,"Looks Good, but that's about it!","I have to say that I was impressed with the software. It worked great for making an exact copy of my DVD's. The only problem is that it seems to have a problem finalizing the disks. If you are burning to DVD+R or DVD-R's this is a big problem. A regular DVD player won't play a DVD+R or -R unless it is finalized. THe + and - RW's work fine.After trying this software, I downloaded DVD CLoner to give it a shot, and I was impressed. It is not anything special, but if you jst want to make cpies of your DVD's, and don't care about the flashy software, then go with DVD Cloner. One warning though, the trial version will only burn part of the DVD, so unless you buy it first, you will waste one DVD. But other than that, it rocks's!I'm not really putting down DVD X Copy, but it just didn't work for me. THey do have a 100% money back guarantee though, so the only thing I lost was my time. No biggee!"
3,"It works, but something could be improved","The software doesn't allow you to burn multiple copies!!! you have to copy then burn, then copy then burn, etc. and so forth. It doesn't say, ""Would you like to burn another copy"" or anything to that effect. It does work, however."
3,Does what it says. Not the most user friendly,"While this software does what it promises- allows you to make back-up copies of movies, it can be a little arduous if you want to eliminate things like extra features or alternative soundtracks in order to make the movie better fit on a blank DVD. There are a few FREE programs available that are MUCH more user-friendly and perhaps even more powerful- AND THEY ARE FREE!"
1,User friendly but.......,"Little functionality. I've learned to make backups of my dvd's using free programs from the internet such as DVD Decrypter and IMGtool. While the program is relatively simple to use, you don't have complete control over everything, like taking out separate audio or video streams in order to fit everything on 1 disc. It seems to me like 321 Studios just didnt try hard enough, and it can be extremely frustrating when the program tells you that you have to make a second dvd disc to include a 5 minute special feature. If you're new to making dvd backups, this is a great choice. But if you want to make a serious backup of your dvd for free, there's better programs out there that wont cost you a penny. (many dvd backup programs and guides are available at digital-digest.com)"
1,Need some help with DVD X Copy,"Hi all-321 tech support was ZERO help so now I am going to try to see if someone out there can help me-I have a brand new Dell 8250 that came installed with 4x DVD+R/RW CDRW combo drive-The computer works great-I had no problem installing the software-When I stick in the origional disk to get it copied it works fine and takes about ten minutes-It reads it well as I can see by the title of the movie coming up on the screen-It then prompts me to enter a wrightable disk-I am trying use brand new TDK+R disks to copy on-But when I insert the disk an error message pops up ""Please insert a wrightable disk"" What the hell does that mean? I just did!!!! Can anyone help offer some solutions? Thanks so much in advance"
5,DVD X Copy Is An Excellent Product,"DVD X Copy worked perfectly out of the box. I have not had any problems with the product. It makes perfect personal backup copies of your DVD movies. Three things you need to be aware of: you have to use DVD-RWs for the copies [not DVD-Rs according to the instructions]; the source disk for your personal backup copy has to be in excellent condition; and it takes two disks to record many [but not all] movies. Scratches on a scource disk that do not adversely affect play with your DVD player may prevent you from making a copy. Apparently a disk must be perfectly readable to make a copy. Based on my experience, be skeptical of the negative reviews."
1,321 studio dose not answer its technical department.,I purchased dvdxcopy and dvdxcopy express. I have a Dell 8250 PC. Both programs do not work properly. 321 studio never reponded to my call.I will recommend not to buy a program from 321 studios.
1,DXD X Copy Company Plants In the Reviews???,"Well.... Reading these reviews, it seems that customers either love this product or hate it.Some of the positive reviews site ""answers"" to some of the poor reviews. Some refer to the program requirements (inferring that the other customer wasn't following them).Still other reviews refer to unannounced product upgrades???My own poor experience with this product and these suspicious reviews, lead me to suspect that these positive reviews were created by the ""321 Studios"" company employees in order to keep sales up.Don't be fooled."
2,Guess I'm an idiot,"As an IT professional, I'm a bit embarrassed that I cannot get this software to work. I have a brand spankin' new super PC and cannot get this software to work. I'm sure it is great for those who can get it to work, it sounds like there are many. However, be forewarned that if you are one of the unlucky ones, like me, who cannot get it to work, be prepared to surf through pages and pages of support forum entries and other web sources that resemble your problem but are not identical. The biggest disappointment with the software is that there is NO tech support. I repeat, there is NO tech support. 321 Studios claims that it offers tech support, it does not. The email support is either unattended or they just simply do not respond. The phone number connects you with an automated troubleshooting system.On the other hand, DVD XCopy Express works great. However, it only copies the movie, no menus, extras, etc."
4,DVD X COPY works great for me,"I installed and used DVD X COPY platinum with no problems whatsoever. I have 3 computers and haven't had any problems with any of them. Program is easy to use and I am sure the people who have problems with the program are easy to blame the program, but I am sure many issues have to be with the computers. The customer service is there to help with problems with the program and not with your computer. I can't even fathom the idea people cant get this simple program to work. I had it installed and burning DVD's in less than 2 minutes. The guy who uses Windows ME, thats the problems, ME never worked right for anyone who uses it. I suggest to upgrade to XP."
1,"Dont even bother STEALING this, it isnt worth it!!","I couldnt wait to get this product, and now wish I hadnt!!! The product is HORRIBLE!!! It actually took a DVD+RW and ruined it so I cant even erase it!!! The movies it claims it copies simply do not work, not in the computer, not in my DVD player! If you are even thinking about getting this piece of junk, go over to the website and reaf through their message forms... nothing but complaints!!!"
1,Save Your Money,It works some of the time. I wish I could have purchased it for some of the price. Save your money and just wait until this technology improves a bit.
4,Product now works great - after a little initial frustration,"DVD X Copy does indeed work as promised, at least for me. I initially had a problem with it locking up my computer until I reinstalled a buggy installation of Nero and removed a couple of worthless DVD to VCD copy programs I downloaded from some fly-by-night web-sites.Since then, I have had no problems. The complaint that it takes 2 DVD-Rs to record many movies doesn't bother me. Those original movies are stamped onto dual-layer DVDs, and the technology isn't available at this time for burning dual-layer discs. Besides, many early DVDs split movies between two sides of one disk. With blank DVD-Rs readily available in bulk ..., DVD X Copy more than fulfills my need to back up my movies economically, and believe me, I need to back them up the way my kids and their friends treat discs.Heartily recommended!"
2,DVD X COPY,Okay product for some dvd copies. But if you have to use 2 dvd disc for one real dvd movie. Then no way. And the real ripoff part is the company doesn't upgrade after a certain vetsion. That means you'll have to buy a whole new version just to get the little tweak they added. ... Plus there are programs on the internet that can do the same thing free. Should cost under ...[undisclosed dollar amount] since the customer has to keep buying every new version.
1,Worked for a few days.,"I bought version 1.5 and used it on my new Dell for 2-3 days and it worked like a charm. Then it started giving me errors every time, sometimes after only a few minutes. I tried the Nero option and the disks work on my computer but not on my DVD player. Wait until the bugs are fixed."
4,A fun tour into battlefield archaeology,"I originally saw this book in the British Museum's bookstore 18 months ago. Because of luggage restrictions, I didn't buy it. This year when I returned to London, I did purchase it. Then I sat down and read through the entire book. The authors pick a famous battle, do general research about it, find some fact and then try to prove or disprove it by--digging trenches. And using ground-penetrating radar, and other high-tech devices. It's quite fun, and interesting what they still can turn up after hundreds of years. Because this is a companion guide to a television series, it's not a hardcore scientific treatise, but designed for the general public.A sequel is available.Now If I could just get a copy of the television series..."
5,One of the best gospel CDs I've ever heard!,This CD is NOT by Thomas Whitfield so if you're looking for songs sung by him this is not what you want. This CD is full of other artists singing his songs. The songs are very deep and spiritual and the music just moves you. I traded one of my John P. Kee cassettes for this one with someone I met on a bus back in 1994. I fell in love with it! The cassette tape is busted now and I've been looking for it for a while. I've been in withdrawl. I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw it here. It's one CD/tape I probably could not live without. Very inspirational and uplifting! A definite must have.
2,Not well constructed,"This is a nice stand because it's very light and portable, but it has poor construction. The laptop is held up by a rubber grip that is attatched to the stand. The problem is that the glue that holds it isn't very good. I dont know if the heat from the lap top makes it stick less or what. Well, my laptop was resting peacefully on it's stand until CRASH, the rubber grip came off and my computer went tumbling to the ground. Luckily the computer was okay. I rapidlly sent the stand back to the company."
2,Hit and Miss,"Just got back from 3 months with this book in SA...Plusses:Great Maps...LP maps are the best guidebook mapsLots of Choices for Hostels/Restaurants...they aren't too detailed but do typically offer a lot of places, while Let's Go will offer 4 or 5 per city.Everyone has got it, you'll find a lot of people to hang out with when going to their recos.Minuses:Everyone has got it, perhaps you don't want to run into a lot of gringos.Doesn't cover lots of small towns which are great to visit...yes of course this is a book that tries to cover a CONTINENT so it's not going to have everything, but I found Footprints SA book to be significantly more comprehensive.A bit out of date...new one is forthcoming, I believe.Overall I would recommend Footprint's SA Handbook instead, although the maps do leave a bit to be desired."
1,tools,These were not what I expected and could have easily bought an impact set that was deep throat to serve the same need
3,Sad story with a satisfying ending,"This book illustrates an excellent example as to why no one should be expected to stay in abusive relationships regardless of the shining examples set church and family. She knows she should have gotten out sooner, but people like her ""just don't get divorced."" Was it worth nearly getting killed over? Absolutely not.The reconstruction of how the children spoke got on my nerve. Children do not speak like that. They just don't, no matter how posh a life they've had. I was a ""prize"" in a nasty divorce, so I know what it's like to be a child in that situation and let me say from real experience that the author did some strange things.If anything, My Husband is Trying to Kill Me, is a testament to why abusive relationships are NEVER okay."
2,too long,"The dress is really pretty, but it's too long for it's size. By the time my niece is tall enough for it, it won't fit, and she is not a chubby girl."
2,Not too bad,"Relaxing, but kind of boring. Sounds are repeated over and over again. I know loons make more noises than just that one."
3,"Make it part of your research, but it's a destination or cannon of any sort.","I'm kinda shocked a the 5-star ratings.I found the Babbitt interview interesting (some of the surrounding details of Princeton-Columbia) and some of the Thermin stuff is fun to watch. Mimi Garrard's choreography was incredible - a very successful staging of electronic music, in my opinion.Pauline Oliveros is someone I ""should know more about,"" so I'm glad I saw her work.But this is not a curated collection in any sense of the word. It's just a bunch of examples of art/music in an electro/acoustic/visual medium.It might help to plug a few small holes in your mental library of this stuff. In other words, there are some good things here that you might come across in your other research, listening, exploring, etc. Worth a rental on netflix, not a purchase.Oh, and the 10 animated short, ""Dust Bunny."" I mean.... what????"
2,A video for wimps.,"When I saw this title ""Jungle Hiking in Costa Rica"" and it's price, I expected it would be a ninety minute video showing different hiking areas in Costa Rica. Instead it was a goofy little romp about walking through jungle for the complete idiot. There was nothing exciting and no real information for anyone who has spent any time in the jungle. It also had no spectacular photography. It's one good point was that it did make me drool in my tapioca about my coming trip to that country. I wouldn't recommend this video to anyone but senior citizens or preschoolers. PURA VIDA COSTA RICA!"
4,Español!!,"Me parece un extraordinario título, aunque siento que hace falta una versión en español que permita expander mejor esta obra."
5,This is the database modeling bible,"Bob does a wonderful job of laying out the rules and really drives home the need to follow them precisly. This book is our bible for database design, if a question or argument arises as to where in the ERD something fits, we just go to the book and let Bob decide.This book is required reading for any database person on my team."
1,Uncomfortable with the style of writing,"I read the previous reviews for this book and thought I was finally getting myself a well written book on this complex topic but alas, the book only caused much frustration.The writing style of the author is very annoying to say the least. The author assumes the reader is a ""dummy"" and tries hard to be funny. He fails miserably at it! After spending three weeks trying to read the book, I walked away being more confused about the concepts I already knew. This book is not worth it if you ask me."
1,Piece of Junk,Used this system on a one hour trip and it worked wonderfully. On the second trip the slave screen died and shortly after the master unit quit.Returned it to Target for refund. Save up your money to buy a good one.
1,Poor Product,This item was purchased for my daughter as a christmas gift. We did not start using it till March. The only use our system got was in the mornings for 15 minutes while in route to daycare. In June the motor went out. I called Polaroid and they advised that it only has a 90 day warranty and they could replace it for us at near purchase price. This item was a huge disappointment not to mention a loss of money. We will never buy another polaroid product again.
1,Didnt last long.,"We have had our DVD player for exactly one year. We used it many, many times, and then it quit. It now will not play any movies. We took it to a repair shop and they said the laser was shot. And not worth fixing. It was good while it lasted."
2,An expensive disposable,"We bought this set to replace another portable DVD system that had served us well but finally wore out. We used it for one trip, which was about 20 hours total round trip. The clarity of the picture was really good, the sound was excellent...we thought we had made a great choice.Unfortunately, after carefully storing the system away in it's original packaging for a few months, we took it out to use for another car trip. Not more than 20 minutes into using it for only the second time, the second screen stopped working. It just went black and that was the end of it. After attempting to figure out if we had hooked it up wrong, we finally gave up and decided to use just the one screen. About 45 minutes into the movie, the screen became very dark, too dark to see anything that was playing, though we could still hear the audio. So, it was useless to us for the entire trip. Polaroid wasn't helpful at all and we just wasted a bunch of money."
2,Too complicated,"Nice idea, but the unit stopped working after the second use. Very tricky for young kids to set up. Would not recommend."
5,Girls Love this Stuff,"This got me major brownie points. Any girl would love to have this cute orange thingy. We watched the movie and she told me she wanted one. Withouth her knowing, i bought one from amazon, and she loves it."
4,"Talented writing, entertaining story","I was reluctant to read this, due to the cliche back cover description of a pure girl falling in with a gambler. But the story is more than that tired description. The author is well-studied on this setting, her writing style is good, her dialogue seems natural. You can easily submerge yourself in the story and feel like you are witnessing the events."
3,Read only for unseasoned pastors,"This work says virtually nothing new to a seasoned pastor. I have been in ministry for nearly twenty years, most of it pastoral, and as I read this book I found myself saying, ""yeah, no kidding!"" There are really no new revelations regarding what pastors go through. However, this book has one very relevant purpose; to help congregations understand the realities of pastoring, and further, suggestions as to how they might make their pastor's life better.The practical worksheet with biblical support at the end of each chapter is what makes this book a worthy publication. I highly recommend using this book with the primary leaders of a congregation-either as preventative medicine or as a tool for reassessing congregational expectations of their pastor."
3,"Pretty decent, once I got a set that weren't broken","This order was such a pain. The first set was broken, the 2nd set only had 1 plate instead of too, then another broken one. Then I finally got my order - but that has nothing to do with this review really, just a warning as I don't think the shipping methods are really ironed out yet for these, so be ready!That said for the product review: They are heavy. This can be good or bad, but they are definitely very heavy. They also absorb a lot of heat so be careful if you microwave them.The last bit and the thing that lost them another star... they come with a horrible sticker across the main portion that you have to take off. On one plate it just peeled right off, but on my other plate it was STUCK. I attacked it with alcohol, wipes, glue-gone chemicals, you name it. Eventually after working on it for a while and 3 separate dishwasher trips, it was finally all gone. Ugh!"
2,DISAPPOINTED,Very disappointed with these trays. Mine came quickly but were broken.What was left felt heavy for a tray/plate. Not replacing.
2,Product received was not what I expected,"I ordered 4 sets of these as gift items. The inside is nicely glazed however the exterior and bottom of the trays are rough unfinished and unglazed. Appeared to be a good product however the rough bottom is very uncomfortable. Upon receipt of the order which was shipped in two differnt boxes, I was only able to keep 2 sets as the other two sets each had a one completely broken in half resulting in me to look for another option as a holiday gift. Not an item I would choose again. very disappointing."
3,"12"" TV dinner tray","Heavier than I thought it would be but that's okay. When cutting with a knife, kind of sounds scratchy, like fingernails on a chalkboard - that's not okay. I would not recommend it but that is just personal preference - not because there is anything wrong with the product."
1,Does the shipping dept know how to pack?,"These may have been nice, but I will never know as they arrived smashed. I got my UPS box and within that box were the two separate boxes containing each of the trays I ordered. Both were rattling and I opened one to see the tray smashed to bits. Since the outer box was not damaged, I have to assume Amazon packed them knowing they were broken. Back they went."
2,Disappointed,I was looking for this type of product but should have trusted my instincts when I saw several peoplehad received broken plates. One of the two plates were shattered. The plates came two in one box. It wasplaced in an Amazon box with only one single plastic pillow packing which was deflated. I'm surprised bothplates were not broken. I am happy with the good plate. I used the convenience of online shopping because I'm taking care of my dad and do not have time to return it. I do alot of shopping with Amazon and this is myfirst problem. I think they need to look into their shipping department
3,Plus/Delta,"I ordered a set of the two dishes...shipped super fast (LOVE Amazon prime!) and unbroken. I don't think that the shipping package has changed from those mentioned before...just think I got lucky. Came two together in a smaller box inside a larger box.Plusses - VERY sturdy dishes and love all the compartments.Minuses - 1) huge sticker placed on the large section is very hard to remove2) the first dish I tried (have not tried the second) is slightly uneven so when I cut my food during the process of eating, the dish rattles. Took care of the problem by putting it on a magazine but bummer to have to do that every time I want to eat on a hard surface."
4,I love these trays,"I got them elsewhere a few years back, and they arrived intact. I wanted to post a review of the trays themselves.They're great. I love everything about them other than they're fairly heavy, but they're big, too, and sturdy. I don't have any reason to get more, as there are three of us and I got six of them, but I really do want more!"
5,Religious change -- the genesis,"It was extremely enlightening to discover how one of the seminal religious figures of the 20th century came to be the person he was. He was, after all, installed as a ""caretaker pope"" at the age of 77. Instead of being a caretaker he substantially reformed the Roman Catholic Church. His journal describes how he evolved from a devout religious young man from a peasant background to a leader in the ecumenical movement. We learn how being a bishop for Bulgaria, Turkey and Greece (where there are few Roman Catholics) enlarged his view toward other traditions. Additionally we find how he was surprised when he came up with the idea of the Second Vatican Council. I found this book very uplifting. Change can happen, and can happen unexpectedly."
1,Useless information,"There is a plethora of new, updated evidenced-based psychopharmacology available in published literatures and this text is the worst example of excessive greed by the authors. This book offers very little in term of ""evidenced-based"" psychopharmacology other than a collection of cited studies for each class of psychotropics. Stahl, Stein and the others most likely paid their lab assistants to collect all the psychopharm studies in the past 2 decades and put all of this together in a book. The materials in this text resemble bibliographies in paragraphs form. Anyone can easily search pubmed and find the same information."
5,Excellent Review!!,"Trust me, You need this book before you go for your oral boards!! These days most younger examiners are testing newly trained professionals in Evidence based psychopharm!!! This is the book to flip thru' to be abreast of all EBM psychopharm!! I thoroughly recommend this book for all residents and early career psychiatrists!!"
5,A door knob. It is what it is.,"I bought this because I moved in with a friend, and the bedroom I use did not have a lock on the door.This particular one, or type, is the kind you can unlock from the outside, by using a pin, or in this case; the included unlocker thingie.Where I am, it is no big deal, but if you are looking for true privacy, or happen to live with a prankster, or peeping tom, or something, you might not want a doorknob that someone can easily unlock. However if you have young children who like to lock themselves into rooms that don't have this feature, and then begin flushing things, then this might be just the doorknob you need.It was easy to install, and thus far has worked as expected. Of course, I was expecting it to work as a doorknob and lock, so my expectations were not all that high.For the price and quality, I can't complain."
1,WHAT???,This is weird a silver guy with a green MULLET!!!! Man if this was made in the ninteys then those dudes who made must be weird!!! DO NOT EVER BUY THIS OR ANYTHING ELSE OF CAPTAIN PLANET!!!
2,Had potential. Playability suffers severly.,"For starters, I'm a mother of a four year old. I love to play PS2 games as well. This game is too hard, and I don't mean for my 4 year old. It doesn't take skill so much as patience. The reason why is because you can't control camera angles which goes all over the place, from birds-eyed view to a full shot of your character running at you. Useless camera angles are detrimental when you're trying to jump or manuever around. Since depth perception is off at times, some things take multiple tries to succeed. My son enjoys it, but I don't. Unfortunately, I have to manuever most parts for him. No matter how smooth I perform, I usually get nauseous because of the jumpy camera angles."
3,Half Done,"My little sister got it for her birthday, so I played it.Not much of a storyline,but you would expect that from Nickolodeon.I had some problems with the camera too.The levels and mini games are okay though with the except of the river racing and moon racing.Both of these parts in the game are hard to control.When you turn in the moon racing mini game or going off a ramp,you can end up swerving in circles or messing up on the ramp.The games is very easy, so many people won't find it challenging.I know most of you people will not agree with this review,but I had to put my two cents in.Bye!"
4,Unbelieveable!,A really fun game. You could go to all different places and play all different game. Lots of Fun!
4,ESL Teacher - Teddy,"I've been using this book for only a couple weeks, but it appears to be exactly (or as near as possible) what I was looking for. I have two grad students whose English is already quite good (CEF C1) but still struggle with their writing. This book goes through the basic dos and don'ts of writing, regardless of academic topics. Having said that, it's not the most user-friendly for the classroom, but then again, writing hardly ever is.I would recomend this book for self-study as well as tutored study only for students really motivated to improve their writing skills, as it is NOT and ESL book, it's a book on writing.The drawback is the absence of an answer key, which I only realised when I got it and started using it. Now I have to get the teacher's guide; I've been teaching ESL for 18 yrs, and there are some tricky things in the book which most teachers (not to say all) would benefit from having a proper answer key and coments.Overall, a good buy!"
3,ok enough,Got as a gift for a college student. An ok guide to helping improve your writing skills at a moderate cost.
4,used book with some notes in it,"I purchased a used book and i found some notes in it, but it is a good book in general"
5,good,"i think this book is really very good~~~~i like this book,just need to wait shiping, this will speed your long time."
4,txtbook,"I really like, the shipment was fast, get in my house on the day before i was expect. Some exercise made in pen but i was able to erase, very satisfy"
5,Good service,"The product was delivered as it was promised, in good condition. Just few things written, but that had been included in the product description."
5,Seller send the book on time and saved lots of money!,Very cheap and half the price then buying from any book store and seller send the book on time.
5,One of the best guides for truly people-centered leadership,"Pollard has developed a fantastic culture at ServiceMaster through his belief in the dignity and value of people. On each page of the text, this principle only becomes clearer and more obvious. Belief in the inherent value of people above all else, commitment to excellence, and unwavering values combine to set the stage for management decisions at ServiceMaster. If you believe that you want to help people change an organization - THIS is the place to START!"
4,Shabu Pot,"Nice pot for the price. Arrived quickly and in good shape. I will be making my own cover out of maple, as the one that comes with is some kind of light stained pine."
1,Freezing,We received this game and it kept freezing up on us. Very disappointed and we had to return the game.
3,It could of been better,"well, I was playing this game and at first I was pleased with the graphics, however I thought the game play was slow, and slugish, I thought at time that the players were skating on mud instead of ice. But once I got play better, and I was skating better, I still found the game to be mildly entertaining. SoI give it three out of five stars."
2,Somewhat disappointed..,Beautiful color and holds plenty of water and is easy to pour. The problem is the lid is quite tight and has scraped the rim of the kettle causing rust to appear after only a couple of weeks.
3,Nice Looking Teakettle,The color was perfect for my kitchen but I'm not crazy about the handle. It's a bit awkward and I have to use two hands to pour. Form wins over function.
1,Dont waste your money!!!,I had to watch this video in my english class and was a waste of my time and probably a waste of money on behalf of the teacher who bought the film.LOOK ELSEWHERE!!! DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE~
4,"lo mejor de,pero falta un hit lamentablemente","excelente compilacion; pero... falta un hit para ser completa. se trata de ""one night love affair"", un temazo de mediados de los 80's que se obvio en este resumen. ¿la razon?... cosas de los sellos. se deseas lo mas escencial de B. Adams, esta es tu opcion; buen sonido por lo demas tambien."
3,Where is his new stuff?,I just went through the itinerary on Amazon and I see that Bryan Adams hasn't done anything since at least 1993 and alot of it is rehashed compilations and it gets tiring hearing the old stuff after awhile even after the dates read on the Amazon pages say that the things were released as late as 2008 which was 4 years ago. This is why I give it only 3 stars.
5,Bryan Adams ROCKS,Bryan Adams is one of the most gifted musicians out there! I bought this CD b/c I love every song on it and can listen to it without skipping. This is a must have for anyone and a classic.
4,"""So Far So Good"": A Great Adams Compilation","This compilation reviews Adams' hits from the ""Cuts Like A Knife"" LP to ""Waking Up The Neighbors"" and is, overall, a great collection to the Bryan Adams' listener. It also includes the gem ""Please Forgive Me"", a ballad co-written by of course, the famous ""Mutt"" Lange. This is a good one to pick up if you do not have any other of Bryan Adams' albums."
4,His best...,"Bryan Adams puts together a solid collection of his hits here. This album proves that Adams is more of a singles star, rather than an album star. There are many noteworthy songs here, including ""Summer of '69,"" ""Heaven,"" and ""It's Only Love."" The one problem that lies in this album is that Adams was partly responsible for the ""formula"" power ballad that evolved throughout the eighties, and this album reminds us of that. However, the collection does manage to mix the songs up so that the ballads are not successive. He does have a distinct sound to his music (and voice), something that is definitely lacking in today's music. The songs are all memorable, though they do not delve into anything beyond what is considered standard pop music. Overall, a good album by a good artist, who though never made a huge dent in pop music, did manage to make a nice ding."
4,Greatest Hits Lives Up To It's Name,"I wasn't too old when this cd came out. My brother was really into country at the time, but I was looking for something more exciting. I found this. And it was enjoyable back then and I still own it today. Bryan Adams is a pretty talented musician. He crafts good soft rock tunes. And I personally prefer him to Rod Stewart. The only problem he runs into is that starting his career in the late 70s/ early 80s, his sound on some of his tunes is very dated.This cd avoids it pretty well though. Summer of '69 is a classic tune. Heaven and Please Forgive Me (recorded in 1993 for this album) are stirring love ballads that we have come to except from Mr. Adams. Granted there is a newer version to his greatest hits that has been released,The Best Of Me. And there is alsoAnthology. So this is a bit obsolete. But still a good addition to your collection, especially if you can find it cheap."
5,"This isn't a review, it's a question.",I vaguely remember seeing a Bryan Adams video in which Sting sang backup and appeared in the video. My friend says I'm crazy. Does anyone know of this song/video????
3,Bryan Adams CD,"So Far So Good is an excellent mix of Bryan Adams music, with several of his best songs on it."
2,very average,"when Bryan Adams first came out i dug his stuff.songs such as cuts like a knife,run to you,somebody,summer of 69,heaven were catchy.but then he went into mellow mold.his music has gotten super sappy and boring."
5,Great retrospective!,"Relive some of the best guitar to come out of the 80s with Bryan's greatest hits...""Summer of 69"" and ""Run to You"" to the sweet love anthem ""Heaven"" (that was a weird video, though, with Bryan playing to an audience of tv sets....anybody remember that?). Sure hope Bryan comes out to play again soon, but in the meantime, feast on this great CD"
5,Maybe the best of Bryan Adams,"All the songs of this CD are so good that you can listen to them over and over again without getting bored. It has all the variety you want in an album - rock, romance , great lyrics etc. I think this is one of the best Bryan adams CD ever. I bought it 8 years back and someone borrowed it and never gave back and I love it so much that I bought it again !"
4,Reading for peace and wellness,"As a retired pastor, and USAF chaplain retired I can positively endorse this product. The Zen portions are read with a desire to learn without changing my belief system. That is my modes operendi. Finding peace and wellness while battling PTSD is difficult. This publication offers new tools for the fight."
3,Interesting; go check out the videotape,"If skined88@hotmail.com had seen the video version of the book, he would see that Ridgeway did extensive interviews with neo-Nazis, and in fact let them speak for themselves.The book itself is interesting, but the video shows these people up for the clowns they really are."
1,Jorge Boosh = Right Winger and Racist?,"Maybe someone should inform Vicente Fox.It's amazing what liberals write these days.And by the way, the Republicans and the Democrats are two sides of the same coin, two halves of the same party. They aren't that different. Both want massive immigration, both want America involved in wars all over the world, both want to move our jobs to foreign countries, both support the new multicultural society, both of them are chock full of people who marry across the race lines, neither really cares for religion (regardless of what the politicians say...I don't see the Republicans putting prayer back into the schools), both woefully disregard the Constitution, ad infinitum."
2,An interesting work of fiction...,"I strongly recommend this book to all leftists and liberals hoping to learn more about the ""new white culture"". Why? Because this book is perhaps the most deceptive piece of work ever written about the movement. One wonders if Ridgeway did any research whatsoever. Being a neo-Nazi skinhead, I have more than a little knowledge about how the far-right works and it seems as though this book was written more about how someone from the left thinks racists should be than how they are. If you really must know how Klansmen, Identity Christians and skinheads think, get a book straight from the source(like the Turner Diaries). Please don't rely on the left for all your information."
2,A Load of Rubbish!,"I seem to recall that the author of this ""book"" did a documentary that aired on PBS some years ago, which was not too bad. Not being able to find a video of the documentary, I looked forward to the 2nd edtion of the book. What a waste! Whoever indexed this thing must have been drunk at the time! Look up any entry in the index and almost none of the references are correct! e.g. ""Swift, Wesley"" refers you to pages 14, 15: but there's no mention of him on those two pages; ""Rockwell, George Lincoln"" refers you to page 21: no mention of Rockwell on that page, but there is a mention of Tom Metzger, whose listing in the index shows no reference to page 21!!! Beyond this, the book was written from the viewpoint of someone with the mindset of Hillary Clinton: not a very inviting alternative to individuals portrayed in the book."
5,My son loves this book,"We've been reading this book to my now 3-year old son for at least the past year, almost every night. He loves the rhythm of the words, and never gets tired of listening to the poems and reciting them along with us. He always asks for his favorites (which change on a weekly basis). There are so many poems and so much variety to choose from, so it's much more interesting to me than reading the same book over and over."
1,Awful Awful Dont buy it,his is yet another awful FPS - the graphics are gritty the controls are twitchy and the bad guys look like they have a weird 'haze' around them. It also has an annoying save mechanism which pauses the gameplay at totally random moments when you least expect in order to save your progress. I played the first level and turned it off. AVOID this one.
3,Black:site 51,"The game is basically too easy.Granted it is made for teens,but I have played games for teens that are much better.Even so,it was fun!I rated it a 3."
2,dissapointing....had some moments,okay guys listen this game to me could have been way better. my husband obviously misleaded (i forgive him tho). thought it was the sequal to Area 51 for the ps2. now that was a great FPS. thats my opinion. i love shooters/FPS but this one i think could have been so much more better. the controls could have been a lil better. i beat this game in four hours. im not a huge fan of just pointing and shooting. i like my FPS to be challenging and this game was not not evern on the hardest diffuculty. so if you buythis game get it used or just rent it your only guna play for four maybe five hours if your skilled at FPS. oh and also the whole driving thing was retarded to the max. hope this review helps if not i apologize.dont leave stupid comments.
2,Outdated game,"Too bad this didn't get more time to be developed. Could have been a good game. As it is the game loads slow, freezes and many problems during the game. Waste of money!!!"
3,Decent...,"This isn't a bad game, but it is a very average FPS. I thought that the story, graphics, and voice acting was above average. The different types of aliens that you get to shoot are cool, too. The thing that keeps this game from getting a higher score is the forgettable gameplay. Aiming is awkward, the environments aren't as destructible as advertised, the weapons are bland, your teammates are pretty dull... there are many other little problems that make this game barely average. If you want a great sci-fi FPS for the ps3, buy Resistance."
4,Great game,I enjoyed this game a lot.Play was simple graphics rocked and I liked the story line.The grunts talked and acted like grunts do.I did think the AI could have been better.I re-play this game all the time check it out.
3,Nostalgia,"A few years back, I possessed a cassette of this CD. Loved the classical Christmas music. The reason for the three stars is the production value of the CD. You have to boost the volume way up to hear it--I don't remember that ever being a problem with the cassette, and wonder if the CDs were made from a secondary source rather than a primary source. Other than that, the music from the Royal Philharmonic is still wonderful."
5,"Loved It! Science, Suspense, Mystery, Murder, Has it All.","If you enjoy medical thrillers/suspense/mystery books, you'll love this book. I had a hard time putting it down. The twists and turns really hold your interest and the science in it is well explained so it doesn't slow the story down. And with all this is going on today w/genetics and DNA it's a very timely thriller."
5,Raising Abel raises questions,"First off I am going to nominate the Gears' as one of the most underrated writing duos in existence. The consistent excellence of their novels combined with the amount of research and information they pack into them make them two of the best thriller writers around. Having said all that Raising Abel continues this tradition in admirable fashion. Strong, believable and sympathetic characters, page-turning suspense, and lots and lots of genetic information explained in an easily comprehensive style make this a cut above even the better thrillers on the market.Combined with the moral and ethical implications of the protagonists experiments, this book has all the ingredients of a great page-turning thriller. If you are looking for something a bit more stimulating and entertaining than the DaVinci Code- then try Raising Abel. You will not be disappointed"
5,Tomorrows Headlines,"In a shift from the normal prehistory novels that they have written, the Gears have kept me totally interested in the news of the day and genetic cloning. Raising Able will not keep you guessing as to why there are murders taking place, but who is the one ordering them? I find the book a very good read as do I find all of their books.I am eagerly awaiting their next release with book Two of the Coming Store Trilogy."
1,Bigotted,"If this book were written condemning Jews, Muslum, or homosexuals it would not have been published. But since it attack Christians and mocks their beliefs it is supposed to be OK. I am glad I did not waste my money on it and borrowed it from the library."
5,danners are excellent boots,"Shipping was a little slower than normal, but outstanding price can not fine many size 7, I've been using amazon.com and you just can not beat the deals!! best boots ive had in a long time. use the wish list and keep checking daily if your looking for something. I got the boots for around $[...] 200 plus reg. price.."
5,3rd brake light cover,This aluminum brake light cover fits over existing lens perfectly. And it comes with longer stainless screws for install. I am definitely satisfied and would recommend it.
1,OOh PUH-LEASE,"Does not work! I have been using this product for many months. It did/does NOTHING. Waste of money, in my opinion!"
4,Good product,Really works but need to use it every night! It burns if you put to close to your eyes.
4,Great work!!!,"Hi, I'm from Poland, I've been a huge NIN fan since a long long time. I enjoyed WT, saw them live (with Jerome) last year in London. I was very excited about nearLY reminder.I think it's a great piece of music, the only thing that I don't really like about this CD are vocals. Anyway I strongly recommend nearly for every NIN/Tool or even Pink Floyd fan:-) !!!"
3,"Good course, but overpriced","... it's overpriced. Throughtout the course I came across several one line facts regarding ADO that cleared up many questions that I haven't found answers to elsewhere, but for the cost of the product, I would have liked more of those little gems.Overall, a good course that I learned from, but at a higher price than I thought was worth."
3,"Overall good, but not consistent, not visionary","This is generally a good book to serve as an introduction to the consciousness of working with plants in a sacred manner. However the quality of writing, though well researched, does not inspire. You don't find yourself absorbed in the writing, just reading facts and stories.There are a few practices buried within the book but they are buried. There should have been seperate areas to emphasize these practices. As an example of the writing style the chapter on healing and death talks about death and how shamans approach it for along time. Then the story about how animals created diseases and how plants offered to help people is relayed. Then the content switches back to the death topic again. The writing shows a general lack of polish and very much lacks telling you how to enter the sacred relationship yourself.A good book, but did not live up to its potential."
2,Not the same,I have the exact globe as in their picture to the lettering on the ball. I thought I purchased another one like it when I purchased this globe but I was sadly mistaken. It had air bubbles in it and the globe is smaller or the ball is bigger so the clearance between the tee and the glass is noticeably less. It is another case where the mfg. cut costs in material giving us less.
2,scratched balls,"Loved the idea, guys loved the gift, lots of hours of fun for all, but they came very scratched, a bit disappointed but still enjoyed by all"
1,See my picture and caption above,"This is really a disgusting merchandise... they seem to have used water that came out of someone's shower drain... well, I don't want to think of it any more. I am returning it."
2,not as advertised,"Do not buy this item, its not delivered as pictured! The image displayed is of a real golf ball, with a real tee, on an astro-turf base. The item delivered is of much lower quality. I received a plastic golf ball (you can see the seam), an over-sized tee on an ugly, molded, green plastic base. I bought this to replace one I gave away to a friend and am very disappointed that when I reordered the globe the one I purchased was so cheap! Anybody know where I can purchase one like the original?"
1,NOT AS PICTURED!!! WARNING!!!,"One - It's a plastic replica of a golfball - lightweight and crappy looking the pin is a plastic cup knobby thing that also sucks. And the bottom of the globe is NON REMOVABLE so if you have stupid friends that need to break the glue seal - it will leak like crazy!something about the plastic is weird - it dissolves lightly through use and makes the water foggy. I got this because I'm a bartender and wanted a bar game for customers to play with. I've used them before - but this has no weight to the ball and the pin is quirky and ugly at best. The worst example of Golf Snowglobe game I've ever seen.However since it's on a bar for a company I no longer work with - I dont care if the thing makes death rattle noises! Ha!PS - I have NO idea why the owner submitted ""waterfall"" as part of the item name - unless they were aware of leaking problems..."
3,Good,"A good book. Not the greatest. Looks at Krishna's life from a analytical, not devotional point of view. Examines Krishna's life in 5 phases: as ""Child"", ""Lover"", ""Warrior"", ""Savior"" and ""God"". Interesting if you're already familiar with Krishna's life, but for beginners I would recommend ""The Play of God"" by Vanamali."
5,viking review,This product is a perfect size for sauces and frying and gets used most in my busy kitchen. Quality is typically viking which is excellent. Shipping was fast! Thanks
1,Not what I expected,"I have been looking for one of these for a couple of weeks. For the price, I thought it would work great. First, It was the size of a salt shaker (did not read description well enough). Second, upon first use while trying to apply a coating of powdered sugar on my funnel cake, I thought I was going to throw my shoulder out. The sugar just will not come out of the fine mesh in the lid. I had higher hopes for this. Unfortunately, It is now packaged for a return journey back to Amazon and I am continuing my quest for the perfect funnel cake shaker."
1,Powdered sugar could not issue freely through holes,"Powdered sugar could not issue freely through holes. Even tried adding rice to my sugar to dry it out, and no luck. Save your money."
2,looks good but...,The shaker does not work well with power sugar. I was hopping it would but for the cost its not worth it.
5,From soup to nuts - it's in here!,"This is an excellent book for those just getting started in the field or considering a move into professional copywriting. The author provides plenty of encouragement, including details of his own journey starting a copywriting business. At the same time, he doesn't gloss over the challenges of the profession. What emerges is an effective, realistic portrayal from a true insider.As important as this information is, the book is at its best when the author dives into the nitty-gritty details of starting and running a copywriting business. He covers everything from getting that all-important first client, to pricing, to dealing with challenging customers, and much more. The book even includes many of the forms the author himself uses to organize and conduct business. This addition alone is worth the price of admission!If you have any interest at all in this field, make buying this book your very next move!"
5,Excellent guide for any copywriter,"Steve Slaunwhite's Copywriting Business is one of the few copywriting books that makes it to the small shelf on my desk. Of course there are far better books about how to do copywriting, but few that are as helpful or clear on the business side of copywriting. Especially written for those just starting out, even old pros (and not-so-old pros like myself) can find useful tidbits here and there. Highly recommended to any copywriter who is thinking of going out on his or her own."
5,A terrific book for new & experienced freelancers.,"Practical, realistic, comprehensive, and an enjoyable read. This book gives sound advice to writers who want to start freelancing and ideas on how to improve business for long-established freelancers. Particularly valuable is the troubleshooting chapter, which provides answers and cautions for common situations that arise for every freelance copywriter."
1,Dont waste your money or your time.,"This was the worst of the Server+ study guides I read. The book in itself is just a bunch of instruction manuals for various devices. The book itself barely covers even half the test, if that, and spends its time going over pointless stuff. The practice questions on the CD are even more worthless than the book itself. Save your money for one of the other guides."
1,over kill,"This maybe a good book if it is your first cert. weak,boring hard to stay focus.Too many facts about stuff I already know."
2,Much Too Technical,"The Author, Stephen J. Bigelow, has written many very good PC hardware books, most which tend to be very technical. He carried this technical style to this book, which is way too much information and way too technical for the Server+ exam. CompTIA doesn't want you to know what all 40 pins of the IDE cable do, what the IBM cable types happen to be, or anything about ARCnet. There is also weak coverage of some of the CompTIA Server+ Exam topics including tape drives, server racks, and server shutdown procedures. A few big mistakes are also present in the book, such as page 28 which shows a picture of a SCSI controller and calls it a Network Interface Card. Don't let this book be your only source of information, if you expect to pass the Server+ exam."
2,Weak,This book is better than the Sybex server+ by a mile but it would be difficult to use this book to pass the test. It is a technical book and the Server+ exam requires the application of technical knowledge and the book doesn't seem to do that well enough. It is a good reference but not the best for passing the Server+ exam
2,Inadequate,"The writing and style were not conducive to effective understanding and assimilation.Topics covered often did not provide enough supporting information. The parts were not put together in proper order. Many new terms, concepts and other things that were thrown into the discourse were not explained until later in the book.This was not a well thought out or organized book."
5,Deadbeat Hero,"I must say, before I had heard this, I had heard a lot of things (mostly good) about Mr. Stanhope. After hearing this, I can see why I had. This man takes absolutely no prisoners. As he says near the beginning of his show, ""Seeing me is like going off to battle, some of you aren't going to be here in the end."" With his content, I can definately see why he might say such a thing. He goes over everything, from terrorism to two-headed babies, he mercilessly covers it all. This guy can deliver too. He flows through his set like no other, keeping everyone wondering the same thing, ""What will he say next?"" It's that good. I'm a huge fan of Bill Hicks and I still wasn't prepared for this. Nobody can be. There is nothing like this."
2,Doesn't stick when ironed,"We bought this to patch up the ellbow parts of my favorite hooded sweater. Within 48 hours, the patches started coming off completely - we had ironed them on the sweater.For what it's worth: my wife ended up using stitches to make sure they wouldn't come off again. They do the job now, but not the way it was advertised. 5 bucks is still a good deal to salvage your favorite clothes but you better have a sewing machine, or be good with a needle and wire."
1,Good while it lasted. No warning of failure.,"I've had this unit for 3+ years and it seemed to work well. However, recently it just fails during even minor power events and my equipment goes down hard. No battery or error warning on the display. It just doesn't work anymore. I would not buy again. Power protection equipment is supposed to self test and warn you if the circuitry or battery has failed. I'm going with a known, reliable brand going forward."
2,Failed after 2 years,"Looks like I should have read the other reviews before purchase. It broke after 2 years and looks like from other reviewers if I don't register within 30 days then they don't honor the 3 years warranty. Oh well, I was giving this product a chance, going back to APC."
1,Ultra 2000 Battery failure,"This product came with dead batteries. The batteries were to dead to even switch on the backup, thus making the batteries unusable. Other than that it looks like a good product.Abram Koop"
4,Ultra,"This is the second one of these we have purchased. They are the best! Software does not work with windows one care live, but that is a minor problem."
5,"So far, so good!","We bought this for our HDTV to protect it when the power goes out/voltage changes. It has worked wonderuflly so far, but we have only had to deal with voltage changes, no power outage yet. We have found it to be worth the money so far."
1,Not recommended at all,"I am using it with Vista. When Vista hibernates the monitoring software (USB connection) looses the connection with the UPS. When you return to your computer you have to ""wake-up"" the connection. Which is necessary to shutdown the computer when there is a blackout. Running a UPS without the monitoring software doesn't make sense.After this wake-up call the UPS starts peeping and you can only reset it by turning the UPS OFF. Of course, you got to turn off the computer as well before doing that.What is that UPS good for then?I don't recommend this UPS at all. I bought this one ( CyberPower CP1350AVRLCD UPS ) at Amazon and it works well."
1,It broke after 2 years and they weaseled out of the warranty!,"I bought this partially because of the three year warranty. It broke after two years and the company weaseled out of the warranty. They said that even though the product says it has a 3 year warranty, it really only has a 1 year warranty unless you register it within 30 days of purchase and now that it is out of warranty they can't help me. If it would have broke in the first year something tells me that they would have found an excuse to weasel out of that as well. Stay Away!!!!!"
1,Will not honor warranty,"After two years of use this product quit providing battery back-up when the power went out, then started shutting off even when the power was on. Though the warranty is supposed to be three years (lifetime if registered within 30 days), the company refuses to honor it. The cheaper price is definitely reflected in product longevity and service."
5,Ultra ULT33046 2000 VA 1200 W Backup UPS with AVR,"Set up was easy, software installed w/o any problems. Had this device for about 3 weeks."
1,"Unreliable, don't waste your time and money","I got two of these from Tiger Direct's retail arm (CompUSA) last year. One lasted less than two months, and the second just died on me this morning.The UPS appears to be one of the new ""smart"" models that can give information on load and battery capacity, however, it really is not. There is no button to select information. It just has lots of meaningless lights on the front, and possibly a measure of input voltage. given the poor quality and early failure, I don't put much stock in that.Save you money. Buy a APC or Cyberpower unit and skip this garbage.I now have Ultra on my list of ""brand names that I will not consider"" for future purchases in all categories."
1,Bad Information !!! BAD BUY,"I bought this UPS because I had read that the 220V outlet, I needed to connect a digital printing (plotter) and my surprise was that the UPS was not able to raise enough energy needed to operate the machine. In general, should check to give the customer information from Amazon and the supplier, because the on-screen ionformación is incorrect and misleading. If you need to operate equipment with 110V output is Ok, but not 220. Bad buy."
1,Waste of Time and Money,"I found the negative - bigotted take on Christianity unsettling. This film was very anti-American in that it perpetuated every negative British stereotype about Americans. You have to check your brain at the door if your going to watch this film. Only those who embrace the counter-culture worldview that hates, America, the traditional family, and Christianity - will enjoy this film.Larry"
1,"Oh, How the Mighty Have Fallen.","Hot Fuzz is one of my top five favorite movies of all time. I also really like Shaun of the Dead and the tv show Spaced. I was skeptical about Paul just from the trailer but I thought, hey, its these guys, its not possible for them to be unfunny.Soooo, I choose to believe (so that my hero worship can stay intact) they they didn't actually write this movie. Nope, it never happened. It was the collaboration of a below average 7th grader and one of those super smart monkeys from Project X. I mean, sure, Virgil knows the sign for apple but can he tell a joke? No, he can not.Seriously, any American comedian could have done this movie. There was none of the subtlety that makes British comedy so magical. If I wanted cheap humor, I'd have gone to see Hot Tub Time Machine. I expected more from you two."
1,....Why Did'nt They Release This On Thanksgiving..?...,...Cause it's one big turkey..!..Only thing missing is Will Ferrell & Paulie Shore as hitch-hikers..! Brits ya ain't been funny since the 70's..! (and that was T.V...!)
1,pathetic tripe,"the only thing to do with this movie is flush it down the toilet, just like the piece of human waste that it is."
1,This movie makes fun of believers of Yahweh and is totally Darwin.,"This movie is not for children or Church going people of any kind. It tries to make Darwinism as fact. It should be called ""The 3 Atheist and a Alien on the run"". Don't waste your money or your time on this one. And i know some butt head is going to react to what i have said. So go find yourself a Alien and write me and i am not talking about one from Mexico either."
1,Won't be letting my kids watch this one.,"The main storyline was good, and the movie would have been great... if they wouldn't have seen fit to add all the anti-religion junk in there. It was very ""in your face"" about their no God (of any religion view) views. Sadly, the movie would have been a great hit had they muted that junk."
5,Paul,This movie has to be watched several times its so good. If you are a Star Wars and Star Trek fan there are lots of lines and scenes cleverly in there to find. Its funny!
4,Love these guys,"I love this movie, the witty, dry, silly comedy from Hot Fuzz and Shawn of the Dead were back in full force. A great no brainer movie with a lot of heart, just like summer movies should be. Although I agree that if you are offended by movies that question religion, steer clear of this one."
4,Enjoyable Campy Sci-fi,"Even though this is a very commercially aimed film, I really enjoyed it. It's got witty dialogue, a wonderful ensemble cast, including Pegg and Frost but also Jason Bateman (I just laugh looking at him at this point and I mean that in the best way possible) and one of my all-time favorites, Kristen Wiig, who is slightly underused in this movie, yet she shines. The bonus features alone are worth the money. This being the unrated version, many scenes are fleshed-out much better than in the theatrical version as well. Fun little weekend dvd to have around."
3,Lightweight fun,"I admit it: I laughed out loud a lot during this movie. However, it is really pretty light and corny. The characters are nice people, though, and the plot has some pretty original twists and turns.(And the allusions to some other SciFi movies made me play those scenes over a couple of times.)"
5,Awesome,Love this movie. Thanks. Shipped quickly and was in perfect condition. Love Simon Pegg and Nick Frost together. I have Sean of The Dead and Hot Fuzz which I have watched over and over. There are several big actors in this movie. Using Seth Rogan as the voice of Paul was perfect. I was laughing nearly the entire film.
4,Liked it,"very simple standard script, with some Very Funny parts to it. Good cast of characters help my rating. I recommend"
5,Hilarious,"This is a very funny movie. Even if you are not a Simon Pegg/Nick Frost fan (Shaun of the Dead, etc), this will make you laugh, a lot."
5,love it,"I bought Paul on a whim as I like science fiction and liked Hot Fuzz. I was not in the least disappointed. I loved it and have watched it several times now and each time I pick up on a new insight of Paul's character and the quirks and gestures of Seth Rogan that in each viewing makes it even more funny. I noted that the majority of negative reviews are based on religion. ""You just can't win with these people."" If you are religious this movie is not going to change your views. Sometimes you just have to ""roll the dice"" and go with it. Enjoy it for what it is. Paul is not real, although I surely wish he was."
5,Ha-larious!,"You have to watch this, I love this movie! If you like ""Shaun of the Dead"", then you will love this movie, twice over."
2,FAILS AT WHAT IT IS TRYING TO BE,"If this movie had been a buddy bonding movie I would have given it three stars. This movie tries to be a buddy-nerd bonding movie and it fails in that sub-genre. To be a movie about nerds or geeks the characters have to have dialogue that is ecclectic and esoteric. The characters have to say things that other geeks and nerds would understand and find interesting but that most people wouldn't. In this movie there are no references to STOS, STNG, STV, Star Wars, Soylent Green, Planet of the apes, Thunderbirds, Dark Shadows, Night Stalker, et al. There is one running gag about a fictional writer. There is also a long diatribe agianst Christianity(although oddly nothing about Islam.) For a movie about UFO's I wonder why they didn't have Art Bell do a cameo. The protaganists in this movie might be geeks but we don't know because they never talk about anything that would be vaguely interesting to another geek. They never mentioned D&D."
3,paul,"the movie was all right,it was a little slap stick kind of movie i thought when i bopught iot that i would be alot funnier bur it was not"
5,Awesome Movie,"Paul is hillarious, this movie is awesome. i love the character. i would like to see a sequel to this movie. this is a great movie. the story was great and the actors were wonderful. this is a must see. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do."
2,It has moments of potential,"The british actors aren't strong enough to carry the movie, and neither is the kiddie alien. The story follows a completely unoriginal track, and the jokes feel stolen from other movies. This could've been fun, but instead it was dull & boring."
5,Lots of FUN @ The movies,"I watched this film 3 times at the movies...if you are a sci-fi movie fan you will love the references to past sci-fi movies and how much fun this road trip movie is:) Can't wait for the blu ray release! For all the idiots out there giving this movie a bad reviewdue to the references to evolution, get your heads out of your arses...it's TRUE! The zealot religious fanatics I have encounteredare exactly as the ones portrayed in this film, so get over it!"
4,FUN NERD HUMOR,"Pegg and Frost return with a new buddy SciFi movie that was described as a love letter to Spielberg. In fact, Spielberg's voice makes a cameo when talking with the wise cracking alien, Paul, but I get ahead of myself. Tale focuses on two UK nerds who travel to Comic Con and then decide upon a road trip to see Area 51. After speaking with the chatty waitress near Area 51 (played by Jane Lynch) they stumble upon an alien named Paul who they help escape from the bad Feds and during that time Paul teaches them about coolness and even gets one of them a girlfriend. It's a nerd fantasy come true and yes there's nerd humor all over the place and nods to several SciFi movies, especially E.T. SciFi fans who want a good laugh will enjoy this film. Sigourney Weaver plays ""The Big Guy"". Jason Bateman plays the gray ally. CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B; STORY/PLOTTING: B; NERD HUMOR: B plus to A minus; OVERALL GRADE: B to B plus; WHEN WATCHED: August 2011."
3,Going Stupid,"Endlessly staying in the US Brits outsmart FBI/CIA by assisting a third undocumented alien of an extraterrestrial origin to re-unite with his tribesmen and traffic an American woman into outer space-worlds.Atheism and anarchy rule, according to this piece of cinematography!"
2,Paul,"Very funny Sci Fi spoof, based upon Roswell crash. Obscene language, no nudity, not suitable for young children. If it weren't for the obscenity children should enjoy."
5,Cute,"Its not for everyone, some people might thinks its dumb, but I thought it was cute and humorous, maybe don't buy but rent if you really arent into the silly kind of comedy..."
4,Slapstick comedy,"Sure some parts are rude and offensive with the language, but we actually enjoyed this movie. Much to our surprise there was acutally a plot to follow. I'd say watch it when you need a mood lift."
5,This was a great find. The price was the best I’ve found,This was a great find. The price was the best I’ve found. It does exactly what I was looking. My wife loves it.
4,"Incredible wit and humor, plus gotta love the SciFi references","Really enjoyed watching this movie for the clever dialogue, humor and scifi references. If you're a fan of Simon Pegg's and Nick Frost's previous movies, this one should delight you!"
5,Amusing Comedy with Heart,"I was pleasantly surprised by ""Paul"". Opening with two Brit SciFi fan ""boys"" at a convention, adding a wise-cracking alien and an intense government agent on chase, and then putting in a story of compassion was not what I expected."
4,Lots of belly laughs!,"Ignore the religious nut & their review. It's just a movie dude, lighten up, it's not to be taken seriously!If you like movies such as ""Shaun Of The Dead"" you'll love this. Really funny & the effects are just great. Paul pokes fun at lots of subjects & does it in a non-offensive, comical way. There's a lot of cussing, lots of action, great story, hilarious characters, what more can you want from a lighthearted, well made movie?"
3,Not hilarious.,"I was expecting it to be much funnier than it was based on the previews. Unfortunately, the previews pretty much show all the funny parts of the film and there isn't much left as a suprise. Amusing, but not the gut busting laugh I'd hoped for."
5,movie review,Okay first of all if you have a problem with cussing in your movie do not buy this movie. If you don't then its a funny movie. Paul is defintinely not a typical ET. I would say for anyone over 18. If you are still not sure just rent it. I bought it and its a good movie.
5,"Funny...but has lots of ""F"" bombs","It's a very funny movie ......but not for some people...There are loads of ""F"" bombs and certain things that may offend people. But I enjoyed it."
5,A Christian Who LOVED This Film,"This is a laugh a minute film that kept me smiling from start to finish. If you're after a detailed movie review, skip this and read other reviews; I rarely write reviews but in this instance I feel I should, so open minded Christians won't miss out. There are a lot of negative reviews for Paul, due to it bashing Christianity: this movie doesn't bash Christianity, only fundamentalist views. If you believe that carbon dating and science are lies and part of a conspiracy, then this movie isn't for you. However, if you have a strong faith in God, can laugh at yourself and people with extremist ideas, then don't miss out on what is defiantly one of the funniest movies I've seen in years because of the negative reviews."
4,There are a lot of subtle jokes which are very funny.,"There are a lotta subtle jokes that I thought were really funny, but the people I was with didn't know them. Kind of like the jokes on the simpsons where your laughing, but the kids have no idea why."
4,Fun Movie,"Being a big fan of ""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Spaced"", I was really anticipating this movie. While it doesn't live up to either of those other shows, it is still a fun movie. Anytime you pair up Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, you can't go wrong. I just can't help but wonder if the movie would have been better having been directed by their usual third party, Edgar Wright. But we'll never know and in the meantime I got a few chuckles out of it."
4,wonderful... lots to laugh about,"I didn't get to catch Paul at theaters.. but i was such a Hot Fuzz, Shaun of the Dead, and Kristin Wiig fan that I bought Paul straight up. I'm glad I did because I now have not only a british-comedy-nerdy type movie to add to my collection but another sci-fi one as well :)I think the balance between simon and nick type comedy added to seth rogen's type cast comedy was just right :)"
4,Paul,"The best , most believable CGI I have ever seen. Also many references throughout the film to other sci-fi classics liek E.T., Star Wars, etc. very funny."
4,Geekfest!,"If you loved ""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Hot Fuzz"", or if you're just a huge geek at heart...you'd be crazy to miss this movie. The special effects used to create Paul have been sorely undervalued; the character looks real enough to blend right in with the live actors. Raunchy, hilarious, and at times even heartfelt. Good, nerdy fun."
3,Overall pretty funny and entertaining,"When I selected this movie, I was looking for something funny that did not require a lot brain power to watch. This movie met that requirement. I really enjoyed the animation with Paul and the story line was a bit hokey at times. Had some good LOL moments and overall it was a funny and entertaining movie. The thing that somewhat ruined my experience was the foul language. Not sure what effect they were going for and I realize it had an R rating, but for my taste it was a bit harsh and too much. It did not add any value to the movie and in some cases was a complete distraction to the story line. Can only give it 3 stars because of this."
2,Shame,Maybe it was mocking american people - perhaps Simon Pegg just can't do that - but his characterizations and most of the movie is just - not funny. Greatest sin of a comedy is being unfunny and mean. I am a big fan of Hot Fuzz and Sean of the Dead - both of which are very funny because they retain just a bit of warmth. This one is cold and silly in an unfunny way. The treatment of american religion is grotesque.
1,Agenda anyone?,"I enjoy comedy. This movie had lots of funny bits in it and the crass humor that i expected for this genre of movie and all was well until the introduction of a ""Christian"" female character in the movie. The movie suddenly became less about a foul mouthed alien and more about God bashing and pushing an atheist agenda. It also portrayed Christians as imbecilic and fools. As a Christian I love to laugh and i really enjoy comedies. This movie had some of my favorite characters in it but i simply couldn't get past all the bashing of the belief in God. 95% of Americans believe that there is some form of God, and i believe that this movie could have been plenty funny without flagrantly calling us all fools. It was very offensive to me and i simply stopped watching."
1,What could have been...,"This movie started out very funny! It made fun of Geek stereotypes, and I could relate. Then act two was about offending as many people as they could, and by act three they were just combining as many curse words together as they could. It was over for me by then. As Dear Abby said years ago about adult language: ""There is nothing 'adult' about it."""
1,"Could have been a much better movie, but...",The makers decided to turn it into an anti-Christian rant. What could have been a funny and cute BFFs-with-an-alien flick was far too preachy and belittling.
1,"Boring, boring, and boring","Have never seen a science fiction, alien, or comedy film this boring - it's boring from the very beginning to the very end even with an alien in the film to spice it up - hard to believe!"
5,"Fun, witty and extremely entertaining!","I rented this not really knowing much about it- I LOVED IT! :) Fun humor throughout, a fun plot and just a really great feel good movie... Kinda reminds me of Galaxy Quest~ I enjoyed it so much I bought it- Witty and very entertaining. Another great movie with Kristen Wigg and Simon Pegg and other stars that I didn't expect to see in it- Will not disappoint if you like fun sci-fi movies :)"
5,Love this Movie SO Much!!!,"After watching this on Netflix streaming a couple of times then renting the DVD we had to buy this wonderfully funny movie. If you haven't had the chance to watch it, do so immediately! Every time we do we find something we didn't notice before. It's the same guys for Hot Fuzz and Shaun of the Dead. Enjoy!"
4,Paul rocks!,"Really enjoyed this movie! If you are a fan of Shaun of the Dead, or Hot Fuzz you will enjoy this. Me being a geek, I really enjoyed the geek humor and jokes. Not high brow, but a lot of fun!"
3,Some hilarious scenes + Funny Dialogue,"I watched this with my friend in the theatre. There are some hilarious scenes. For example, the scene where it looked like Paul was going to cure the injured bird but he....The dialogue is funny in many scenes. However, most of the times it's not suitable for children.It's worth watching once."
2,it was ok,"a co worker recommended it, I thought it was kinda dumb, if it wasnt for Justin Bateman, & the guys from SNL dont think it would have been as funny as it was..I mean, I love stupid humor movies a lot, but this isnt a fave of mine."
3,Great little movie that fundmentally slams and exposes liberals,"The movie was a great parody of liberalism and found the lines and acting really good. Most telling was when Paul ""enlightened"" the leading girl, don't remember name, and she immediately goes into a rant of cuss words and wants to fornicate and do drugs. Very telling of the liberal ideology, promises enlightenment and higher knowledge but ends in the gutter...no solutions for world hunger, AIDS or war...just a one way self absorbed trip to the gutter. Also exposes the liberals weak minded view of Christians. Can only view a 2000 year old global religion as some rednecks in a trailer park. No Cathedrals or great works of arts...just a fool with a shotgun in a trailer park. The main character's paranoia was very well acted. Anything not like them was scary and feared."
4,Different than what I thought,I thought this was pretty good. Funny. Very different and very well done. Loved it and would see it again.
2,Paul,The preview that I saw of the DVR was extremely misleading as to comedy content. I found the movie to be very boring.
2,The Most Anti-Gay Movie I've Ever Seen,"Paul has an okay beginning, but it falters when it becomes homophobic. The word ""fag"" is used at least four times that I counted in the movie's duration. Even Sigourney Weaver says it. The alien Paul is pretty annoying and I got no laughs from him whatsoever. Really, Kristin Wiig is the only bright spot here."
2,A religion bashing comedy?,"I am not a Bible thumper holier than thou kinda guy, but this movie was not funny. I never did laugh out loud or even smile at this movie. I enjoyed all the other movies with these two actors in, but this was just plain bad writing. I am glad I just rented it. If you are curious I would suggest renting before buying. The whole religion bashing added into the middle of this movie does not add anything to the film. I think they put it in there just for the little bit of talk time/interest it would provide. There whole argument against religion is basically religion = Idiot non religion = smart cartoon alien. No smart funny banter for pros/cons of each belief. The key word in that last sentence being funny. rent this or just skip it there really nothing to it."
2,Ho-hum,"I am a huge fan of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, love their other movies... I am not a Seth Rogen fan(other than Knocked Up and Superbad) and his director friends just seem to wanna carry his shtick for as long as they can, even if its animated. You can really see he tries to hard and has to swear even more to pry laughs out....Other than that, he does not necessarily drag the movie down, its pretty much the most unfunny movie of the Pegg and Frost movies. It has laughs here and there and unfortunately I laughed harder in one scene without any of the 3 main stars. Its a rental but don't get your expectations up."
3,Does anyone know....,Does anyone know what the lyrics in Driving With the Brakes On is all about? It is very intriguing. The song is beautiful and I only gave this CD a 3 star because I haven't really listened to the rest of it because I am obsessed with this song.
5,This album makes you think...and feel.,"While music and lyrics hold their own appeal for varying reasons, Del Amitri's Twisted is among my favorite albums because of its uncanny ability to make me think...and feel. As another reviewer mentioned, there are songs for many occasions here, and what will sneak up on you with repeated listens is that this album is one of the most emotionally uplifting ones of the band's career. Perhaps due to the song sequencing and smart[ing] lyrics, we're taken on a journey that's very stark, and there are overt ""up"" and ""down"" moments to which we can all relate. This album does it all: It tugs at your heartstrings; it makes you pound your fists in frustration; it makes you wish you felt more than you did. And feel you will.Highly recommended."
5,There is so much more than ROLL TO ME!,"Twisted is a great album, as are all the Del Amitri albums. This album contains many great songs. I think the opening song, Food for Songs is one of the Best opening tracks I have ever heard on an album. Tell Her and Here and Now, and Driving with the Breaks on are some of the most beautiful songs Del Amitri has ever recorded. Never Enough captures the mood of being a lonely commuter to a tee. While, for some reasons I think Waking Hours and Change Everything are Better Albums as a whole, Twisted still rocks."
4,insane clown posse,"deli amitri, this album has the quality of early stones records and the pop flavour of the beatles, without the nonsense this has too be one of my favorite records they exicuted perfection when they made this record, it has the deemable qualities with perfect song writing, with excellent off the lip lyrics they are truly beautiful and the music sets the tone for roses and summer afternoon without the heatwave,i have two deli amitri albums this and ""some other suckers parade"" two of the best pop/rock album of the 90's i can't decide what album i like best it changes every couple of weeksbut i'll tell you, you can't get any closer to an perfect masterpiece of an album than this, get it now,it features the samash hit roll to me with the addictive chrous and chord progression"
4,outstanding,"I have been a Dels fan since ""Waking Hours"" and have yet to find a band that equals their quality of music. The great number of songs in their catalog is just astonishing. ""Twisted"" is another outstanding cd. I must admit I was not as taken with it at first listen as I was with ""Change Everything"". It had songs that immediately I was drawn to ""Here and Now"", ""Roll To Me""(although this song needed to be longer), ""Never Enough"", ""It's Never Too Late To Be Alone"" and ""Driving With The Brakes On"". Now after many listenings I'm to the point that I wish the cd had many more songs. As I said it is simply an outstanding cd. I am also among those who have never figured out why this band isn't a superstar group. Oh I guess great songwriting and lyrics along with great musicians aren't what people look for today."
4,"wonderfully diverse, informative, held my interest","At first glance, this appears to be a book about travel, but look more closely! As a parent of a Chinese daughter, I found the essays written here insightful. Stories recorded by Chinese women, comments about living and working in Chinese culture; I enjoyed this book and so have the friends to whom I have loaned my copy."
4,A good pack for a day trip.,"This is a great pack for a day trip to grandmas. It only holds about 4 cassettes, so if you have a lot of books you should go with the zipper case. Other than that, my daughter loves it."
5,Cute,My Grand daughter Loves her Pink & Purple Bag. Plus she can tell the difference between hers and her brothers on sight. ( Blue and Purple) !
4,Nice to use when traveling,"We purchased this backpack for my daughters 3rd birthday. Right now it's a bit hard for her to easily get things in and out of the bag by herself. However, we love it for traveling to Grandma's house. She can pick out her favorite books and everything we need fits nicely in the bag.The pink and purple design is great since she is a girl but it also makes it very easy to distinguish her LeapPad equipment from her older brothers Quantum Pad things."
4,great but heavy and with limited storage,"Honestly, I only used this for one trip through Peru because I gave it as a tip to our tour guide, who was manic about recycling our wasteful plastic water bottles and who clearly taken by it. She loved it because it's so simple. Personally I suck down water like mad, and I didn't find that it held enough water for the day. So, I had to buy some bottled water anyway. If you're thinking about this product for city-based travels (where tap water can be found) then it's probably perfect. I did find a solution that works for me, which is a high end but impossible to break water purifier (MSR MIOX) to use with my camel back. Now I never run out of water. The MIOX is expensive and somewhat complicated to use, but I'm an engineer, so it's fine for me."
4,Transport me away to the place of my dreams.,"This is an electronica single featuring vocals by Gillian Anderson. She doesn't actually sing, she speaks the lyrics, which are sort of science fictional. There are four mixes of the song here. The second and fourth mixes don't have Gillian's lyrics, other than ""Extremis"" being repeated over and over."
3,Entry Level Program,This is an entry level program. Good software and quite usable. But this is like PC DJ blue with less bells & whistles
2,Great... when it works,"This toy is awesome when it works. Totally hilarious for children AND adults! But it doesn't always work. In fact, mine never works properly. He says ""I got to sit down"" but always fails to sit down. My sister's never works right either. It's too bad, because when it works, it's hilarious!"
2,Not as fun as expected,"This looked like it would be a great toy, do the same things as the TMX elmo, but unfortunately it didn't, only about 1/3 of the action, and not nearly as fun, I would recommend buying Elmo"
2,Ours Didn't Work,"We purchased the TMX Cookie Monster on clearence at Walmart for $19. When we brought it home and took off its ""try me"" tag, Cookie monster started laughing, dropped to the ground, rolled on one side, and then stood back up, only to fall back down. Ours just didn't work. Cookie Monster will actually tell you his moves and when he rolled to one side, he would say, ""have to roll to other side."" Only ours didn't roll to the other side, he just stood up and fell backward. I thought maybe the problem was that it needed new batteries. This was no good at all. He still didn't work after batteries were changed. We took him back to the store."
3,bought it for my great-granddaughters,"I bought two of these for my ggds for Christmas--not Xmas yet, so who knows if they'll like them? My youngest ggd isn't even born yet (due Feb). I can say shipping was fast and they arrived in good condition.BTW, those star ratings are completely off the top of my head, for the reasons stated above."
1,Broken,The product I received was broken and they weren't able to replace it with a new one. Very disappointed!
2,adorable but very fragile,"I saw a friend with this & LOVED IT... HAD TO HAVE IT... However, adorable.. But my son knocked it over while it was in play mode a few times & now it doesn't work properly... It's a shame cause it's a really neat toy"
2,Disappointment upon arrival,"The toy never worked as it promised to. I ordered this for a friend's kids as a Christmas gift. You have to tickle it everywhere and really hard for it to laugh. After a long time of waiting and messing with it, this quiet thing suddenly burst out a big laughter and that sometimes scares the kids. It will laugh and sit down but never stand up - not sure if it's suppose to or not. Changed all the battery for fully charged ones, didn't help. If my friend wants to return it I totally agree."
4,Not just for kids!,I bought it as a birthday present for a 20 y/o friend and he really liked it.The concept is really funny.
3,"Average fun, but cute.","I like the toy. My ten-month-old is afraid of it right now, but I think he will like it better when it is more age-appropriate for him. It is a little smaller than I expected...I think it is smaller than the TMX Elmo. Other than the size, it is what I expected."
2,Eh......,"I (i mean santa lol) got this for my daughter for christmas, it doesnt seem to always work properly the words dont go along with the motions, n sometimes when he ""sits down"" he rolls all the way back. My daughter is currently scared of it lol so maybe when she gets a lil older she'll like it! Kinda bummed that it doesnt work all that great though. Not to mention it requires 6 AA batteries yikes!"
2,Poor quality,We have only had it a week and it already doesnt sit down and roll around half the time it just stands there.
2,FIRST TIMERS BUY ELMO THIS DOESNOT WORTH IT,"THIS VERSION OF TICKLE ME SERIES ONLY GETS TICKLED FROM TUMMY AND THATS IT. ORIGINAL ELMO TICKLES FROM 3 PARTS FROM TUMMY, UNDER THE CHIN AND FEET. THIS IS NOT AS LOUD AS ELMO. ALSO HAS LESS MOVES THAN ELMO. IF YOU ARE COLLECTING IT IS ONE THING BUT IF THIS IS FIRST TIME BUY ELMO. I WOULD RECOMEND ELMO ELMO ELMO"
4,FUN TOY FOR LITTLE ONES,THIS MONSTER MAKES YOU LAUGH!!HE IS EASY TO OPERATE AND IS GREAT FUN FOR SMALLER CHILDREN.
3,TMX Cookie Monster,"I got this toy for my son's birthday. I never saw the original Elmo from the Nineties. So, I can not make a comparison. I can tell you that this thing is a battery hog! If the batteries are not fully charged ""Cookie"" will not go through all his moves and has trouble getting up. On the other hand, when his batteries are fully charged, he almost seems to be too revved up. He sometimes falls back down after he gets up. But, he will stand up again if he falls. All in all, this toy does make my son happy. He laughs at it a lot. So do I, sometimes. Just be ready to change the batteries more often than you do with most toys. And that is six (yes six AA) batteries, not two or even four."
5,Sure to make you smile!,"I bought this for my 1 year old. Actually I have to admit I bought this more for me and my wife. It is so funny and is sure to put a smile on your face. While my daughter is too young to know how to make him laugh she gets a kick out of him every time.I haven't had any mechanical problem on my unit to this point, about 3 weeks of use.Highly reccomended. By far the best of the three. Ernie is pretty good too, the Elmo is just annoying in my opinion."
3,tickle me tiny,"Im a parent of boy/girl twin who lives in NYC. I purchased 2 tmx for their xmas gift (elmo & cookie monster). Here are my pointers: Cost: elmo is $30 less vs. monsterBattery usage: elmo still works from sat-tues Vs. monsterneeds new set of 6 batt as of tues a.m.Size: elmo is taller & wider vs. monster (14.5""H vs. 11.5""H)Action: elmo has 2 more mvement vs. monsterSayings: monster has funnier sayings vs. elmoTexture: both feel softWeight: Both are weighty & seem durable"
3,He eats batteries,My baby loves this toy....my two year thinks he is okay. I honestly hate how he keeps eating my batteries and when he eats them he eats 6 at a time......Even though Cookie is cute I am not sure he is worth the bAttery expense
4,Worth it if under $20,"I got a super deal on this around Christmas - I think it was only about $13! It was definitely worth $13. At first it made my one year old cry. I think she thought there was something wrong with Cookie. But then she got used to him and she loves him. He made my husband and I laugh like crazy the first time we tried him out, especially when he says at the end ""Oh, THAT GOOD ONE!"" I agree with others; he is a big battery hog. I haven't changed out the batteries yet, so he can't move around as well right now. But he does still bend over and shake a bit, and his voice is still good. So it doesn't really matter to a one-year-old! I am glad we got it, but might not be as thrilled if he had been over $20 (as he is as of this writing.)"
2,Not impressed,My son got cookie monster for his bday he recieved elmo last year for xmas I was not at all impressed with either of them and he could care less about either of them. Overall as a collectors peice Elmo was okay but to just buy and play I would hvae never purchased it personnaly
3,Cute Toy,"We got this for my 14 month old son for Christmas. He loves the toy and just giggles and giggles, but it doesn't hold his attention long. When I start to play it by pushing his tummy, all my son does is push him down. It was cute, but on the shelf it sits. Cookie has a problem with his moves quite a bit. He says all the things he is doing, but the moves dont really correspond all the time. Sometimes he has a hard time going down and rolling from side to side. Not really sure why, even with new batteries."
1,Doesn't Work like advertised.,"This is supposed to lay down roll side to side and then stand up. I have traded this toy in twice at a local store and none of them worked properly. Plus, it scares my 1 year old."
3,born to sing.,"though they entered the market at a time when girl groups were a dime a dozen and poor promotion was a death sentence, for real is definitely the real deal. covering musical styles from zhané to the jackson 5 to miki howard, necia, t, josina and wendi exhibit exception skills and harmonies that easily put them in a class with en vogue and brownstone. one listen to the acapella ""you don't know nothin'"" leaves no doubt that for real's lack of recognition is through no fault of their own. thoguh this album doesn't have any real stand-out tracks, it makes for pleasant listening."
4,For Real,"This CD showcases great vocalists, however the productions were drab and didn't keep the interest. The Track ""Don't Know Nothing"" gives a great example of the strength of the artist, and was the reason for the purchase."
3,I was trying to remember this group....,"Remembered the song ""you don't know nothing"" cause I liked the ending where they broke into 4 part round-the rest about them is a blur....."
5,With more than 160 species of flowering plants,"Filled with 224 color photographs as well as extensive descriptions, drawings, and a wealth of factual information, Wildflowers Of Unalaska Island: A Guide To The Flowering Plants Of An Aleutian Island by Suzi Golodoff is a superbly presented and enthusiastically recommended identification guide to more than 160 species of flowering plants. Ideal for readers of all experience levels in floral matters from recreational hikers to professional botanists, Wildflowers Of Unalaska Island is a truly first-rate, ""user friendly"" resource for quick reference, which includes Aleut (Unangan) Native American names and ethnobotanical information on the wild and hardy plants of this enduring environment."
4,Matt Hoffman's Pro BMX2,I like this game a lot because when I went to my friends house he rented this game.He said I like this game and now its his birthday.My mom said no i cant get the game for him.Atlee Gallimore
5,Beautiful watch!,I just bought this beautiful men watch and I must say that is simply stylish and elegant. Such a perfect gift for a special guy.
4,Good product,"My kids love being read to by Teddy Ruxpen, this book is a continuation to the books that came with him. My only complaint is that I feel the books are a little overpriced, but my kids really like them and get a lot of time out of them, they like to read them over and over again, so I guess it is a good value."
4,"Fast Pace, Good Read","""One Better"" was our book club's September selection. This book was very easy to read and hard to put down. The only thing I didn't like was ""I wanted more!"" I wish that it had gone into a little more detail. I really enjoy Ms. McMillan's writing (I loved Knowing), and I really look forward to Blue Collor Blues!Pamela Walker Williams, The Good Book Club"
4,INTERESTING BOOK!,"This was the first book that I've ever read by Roz McMillian, I bought Knowing, but have yet to read it. One Better was very interesting. I particularly liked the names of the characters, but I did not recall or read why the daughters called their mother by her first name? It took awhile for me to get into the book, but once I started it, I had to finish it.... it was a good read."
2,Come On...,"I admit I have not nearly finished this book and probably never will. It is uninspiring and replete with efforts. I don't mean to be demeaning, only truthful."
1,ONE BETTER THAN WHAT?,"I picked up Rosalyn's first book out of curiosity. Didn't move me. I picked up the second one again out of curiosity. While Ms. McMillian to describe a room with perfect clarity, I could care less it if's persian or outdoor carpet. Paint me characters, not the color and styles of the rooms they are dwelling in. And where did she get those names?"
2,No substance-Just couldn't get into it!,"I really tried to read this book- really, I did. But I could not get into the storyline- no substance! Also, the chapters were too long! The characters just could not keep my attention. I'll continue to support my african-american authors, but I really thought this book needed a lot of editing!"
2,MOVE OVER COSBY'S,"OKAY, Okay I guess I don't get out much, there are rich Afro-Americans, and I am not one of them. But if I were I would not name my children Mink or Sterling and then to have a boyfriend name Golden, I think Ms McMillan loves the good things in life, gold, silver and mink coats. Oh and we can't forget Spice, but thats a nickname, I was disappointed that no one was named Sugar. I read this book and still not sure if I even liked it, I guess this one has to grow on you. But I was sadden that other than Spice's love for Carmen, nobody really loved anybody. Talk about dysfunctional families. If you are the nosy type and like secrets, read it just to find out Carmen's. Don't rush out and buy this one. I did not read ""Knowing"", but after One Better, I am not in a hurry. You should always say something nice. I liked the color of the cover. (I only reviewed this book because my sister Ann likes my reviews)"
3,Pretty Good overall,"In the beginning the story line was a tad on the slow side. I continued to read and was glad I did. I didn't understand why the girls called Spice by her first name, I can't understand why Carmen never stepped in when Spice flat out said she didn't love Sterling like she loved Mink. And Spice falling for Golden so quickly took me by complete surprise! One more question...... what happened to Uncle O after he got caught?? The ending was sad and made me cry but, I did enjoy the book. :)"
4,A great recommendation for friends!,"""One Better"" started out RAW. I thought it jumped really fast into where the story was going. As I read on, I became more interested in the characters and wanted to find out more. I still can't get with the girls calling their mother by her first name, but the story brought me to tears in the end. I certainly recommend this book and in my opinion I think Terry McMillan is a very good writer but Rosalyn is 'one better'. Keep up the good work!"
3,Nice Vacation Read,"I read this book while I was on vacation I thought it was OK I really did enjoy some of the characters but I figured it out(who Sterling's mom was) the very first chapter I thought it a great lesson in friendship (Carmen and Spice) but I also thought Spice was a not ready to take on the responsiblity of rasing a child that was not her blood she could not give Sterling the love that she gave Mink and that can affect a child and it did, overall her debut novel (Knowing) was much better written. I like Rosalyn as a writer but I like her sister as a Realist (not including How Stella got her groove back thumps down)."
1,Nothing's Better about this,"I am a lover of all types of books, and I must say I can't ever recall reading one as bad as this. I normally do not write reviews but after reading this book I just had to. The characters and the plot are both very underdeveloped. I felt left out of the novel and could barely finish. I don't feel that Ms. Mcmillan fully gave us a picture of her characters; she didn't make us love them. I felt like they didn't even love one another. I think the idea behind the book was a good one, just poorly written. I have noticed that a lot of reviewers are comparing Terry and Rosalyn. I am not. They each have a seperate style and deserve due credit. With that said, I am basing the following on Rosalyn's effort in this novel alone:this book stinks!"
4,A heartfelt book,Spice and her daughters were similar to a lot of mother/daughter relationships in America today. The other characters in the book were also people whom in one way or the other were similar to someone I could identify with. The book was good...one better than Rosalyn's last!
5,A great book. The characters are like people in my family.,"One Better was a refreshing read. The characters were three-dimensional, which made them very realistic. The scenes in the restaurant that Spice Witherspoon were so descriptive that I had to keep making trips to the kitchen. My favorite character was Sterling. She seemed so sad. I was rooting for her to kick her drug problem and kick her co-dependent boyfriend Bennie to the curb.I can't wait until Ms. McMillan's next novel comes out because I finished this one in two days."
1,Not a very good effort.,"Knowing was less than average. One Better is an outright dog. It completely failed to capture my attention. Rosalyn is living off the name of her sister, but her talent is far less. After buying Knowing and being less than impressed with it, and then hearing a less than glowing review from a friend who had read One Better, I decided to borrow this book instead of buying it. I can only say that I'm glad I didn't buy it."
3,Slow at first but definitely gets better,"I read Knowing years ago and I really,really enjoyed it. Rosalyn is a great writer. She is not of the new age writings where there are many typos. Her writings are comparable to her sister Terri Mcmillan. Excellent writing well done. The story starts off real slow but it picks up and is a tearjerker in the end. The story is about Spice and her two children Mink and Sterling. It is about how Spice works herself out of poverty and tries to show her children how to always be one better. Even though Spice worked so hard for her children to have a better life Sterling never seems to get things right.This is a must read."
3,"OK, But Not My Cup Of Tea","If you like Dynasty, Joan Collins, or Harlequin Romances then this is the book for you. This book had the potential of being excellent because it carried great storylines, but became too unrealistic and unnecessarily detailed. Some scenes had me shaking my head saying, ""This is truly fiction."" However, I did enjoy the quotes provided by different writers at the beginning of each chapter. For something meatier I suggest reading ""Tryin' to Sleep in the Bed You Made"" by Virginia Deberry and Donna Grant."
2,Soap Opera Drama,"Okay, the reason I really read this book, because I must say, when I saw it in the book store, and saw the characters' names - Spice, Mink, and Sterling, I was not at all intersted in reading it, but my friend said that it was just great, and leant it to me, so I read it. And upon reading it, I found myself laughing incredulously at the very unrealistic situations that the characters were involved in. I mean, of course, I'm one of the people that sincerely wishes that I could have it like that, but come on - how many people do you know that are involved in all that and rich and successful to boot? I know a few - I see them all the time - on 'One Life To Live'.."
2,Expected Better&#65533;,"Even though this was my first novel that I have read by Ms. McMillian, I wasn't impressed. I just found the characters wrap up into some unreal life drama in relationships and reality. However, I did enjoy Ms. McMillian's concern and portrayal of drug abuse, which is a reality. The excitement of the novel didn't appear until the very end, which made this novel hard to get through, I kept putting it down. Good entertainment, if you like soap operas."
3,Okay,I didn't connect with any of the characters and could not empathize with them either. The author didn't have a character that stood out from the rest. The story line was good though.
3,This book kept my attention,"This was a pretty good book, It did seem somewhat, ""upper class"" for an Afro American family, ya know we all wish we had it like that, but It was still interesting reading. I would recommend it..."
2,Totally superficial and unrealistic,"I read this book four months ago and have since read six additional books. However I can't forget how terribly superficial and unrealistic this book was. It was recommended to me by a customer in a bookstore who said it was very good. I guess if you are interested in a book with no substance, chapters full of almost explicit not to mention unrealistic sex, and endless descriptions of immaculate furnishings and delectable foods this would be a good read. As for me it was a complete waste of money. Maybe next time Ms.McMillan will write ""One Better"" than this."
1,Not worth it,"Once again, the grinder comes apart and ruins another meal by dumping peppercorns into and onto all food and adjacent surfaces. Why do I keep on trying to use these (I have 3)?"
2,has major flaw,"The idea is good, but as others have reviewed here, the top easily comes off even while gently grinding and dumps peppercorns onto your plate/dish. It happened to both myself and my wife while cooking, and we aren't clumsy oalfs (wait, hmmm no, we're really very careful)Two meals wrecked before I junked this item."
3,OK but,"My only complaint with the product is that when using it the glass jar came apart from the grinding part thus allowing most of the peppercorns to spill out. This happened twice, once for me and once for my wife. Somehow the grinder should be designed better to prevent this. This is a big problem. I would hesitate to ever let a guest use it."
4,"Love it, But...","I've been using my OXO Grind It set for a couple of years. I absolutely love the grinder as a pepper mill. Using it as an easily convertable grinding apparatus, however, leaves a little to be desired. Changing it over to another jar usually leaves some traces from the previous jar. That is the ONLY flaw I've found. I am considering purchasing a Basic Set just to get two more grinding parts. I use the grinding part every day and it is the best I've found."
3,They look nice & the price was right but....,"I agree with the other reviewers who said the tops come off in use....particularly the pepper mill. I had peppercorns dumped all over my food, table & floor not once, but twice. You must be aware of your hand and finger placement before grinding. The salt comes out in a flurry too, more than expected...you only need one or two turns to get what you need. I guess they take some getting used to."
2,Pretty much sucks,"I really like Oxo items. I got the pepper grinder after years of needing one - I really wanted a metal Turkish Coffee Grinder which makes a GREAT pepper grinder, but they're too expensive and no one seemed inclined to buy me one for Xmas.Sadly the pepper grinder is pretty terrible. It also fell apart on me, spilling peppercorns everywhere. Sure am glad I have wood floors so they could go shooting under every possible appliance.That was when it was grinding, at least. Only a few months in and with light usage it just doesn't grind anything anymore. The peppercorns don't seem to make it into the grinding area except for maybe one every 30 or 40 seconds."
4,Cookies & Brownies,I sent these as a gift to my Dad at the care home but my sisters said they were great tasting and presented well.
3,The early classic,"This is the first album of ""Adventures in Odyssey"". It has some laughs and introduces us to a heap of new characters."
3,Fact or fiction it's fun,"Seems more fictional than factual, but that's probably because all the crazy and unlikely events that happened over a long period of time, here happen within 24 hours. That's the format of the book. Still, for all it's feeling of unbelievability, it was a fun read, and the book's events will, no doubt, come back to me vividly the next time I arrive at an airport."
3,Do you want Wings with that?,"The stories in Air Babylon are all perfectly true. I've heard them all before from people I know who work in the industry (not that hearsay proves hearsay, but stil....)I did catch one glaring mistake... when the Captain says that he was taking them all down from London to Sydney today. Um, no you're not. You're getting off at Bangkok and a new crew's coming in for the BKK - SYD leg. Hasn't Imogen heard of Duty Time Limitations? Of course she has! She even wrote about it in an earlier part of the book. So, strange to find such a glaring mis-statement.Time to 'fess up. I'm only half-way through. It is shaping up to be an enjoyable read. However, the primary story arch seems nothing more than cover for the anecdotes. So don't expect much of 'story'. But who the heck cares when the anecdoates are this much fun?"
4,Reason for CD title,"He titled the CD as a goof ... remember Frampton Comes Alive and Cheap Trick's at Budokan.... Hiatt was just playing on words..... and all the shows he played at the State Theatre in Portland, ME were great....I worked them all and enjoyed every one."
2,Hiatt plays in Maine,"Where did the title ""Hiatt comes alive at Budokan"" come from when all the tracks where recorded during his 1994 tour, only one in California, and that one in San Luis Obispo, not at Boudokan??? The fifteen tracks represent some of Hiatts biggest hits including 8.""Have a little faith in me"", 11. ""Perfectly good guitar"",and ""Slow turning, but unfortunately the sound quality suffers compared to his studio albums. ""Walk On"", ""Perfectly good guitar"", and ""Bring the family"", are better choices if you want to hear John Hiatt at his best."
2,Did Not Stand Up Over Time,Its probably a good thing these are out of stock it did not hold up well over time. The plastic came off it was a mess.
5,Works as described,Good wrench for the money. I use it on my T/C Hawken regularly. Hasn't shown any signs of poor craftsmanship.
4,Dead Body Is A Sleeper,"I have a vague recollection of this movie being released in the dead of winter when the studios dump product they don't know how to market to wither and die. Naturally it met lukewarm critical and commercial response. I came across it at a used video store and purchased it because of Paul Rudd's prominence in the cast. I'm a big fan of Rudd's and he's very discriminating in the projects he participates in so I was intrigued. Not surprising Rudd delivers his usual effective self-deprecating work. The real eye-opener was Lake Bell who gives a refreshingly wholesome and funny account of a psychic who is in love with Rudd's character. This was promoted as a vehicle for ""Desperate Housewives"" Eva Longoria who is quite good but this is more of an ensemble piece. Its kind of a throwback to oldtime screwball and it works but doesn't achieve classic status. That shouldn't be a knock on the film. If you go into it with an open mind you'll find it to be engaging light comedy."
3,Over Her Dead Body,"I thought this would be great, but i was disappointed. The story lagged and the acting was not that good."
1,Lake Bell needs should be a caterer not an actress!,"This movie drags like no other. The only reason why this movie would even get one star is the saving grace of Eva Longoria, who provides some comic relief which is still few and far between. I was excited to see the movie because I'm a big fan of Paul Rudd and Eva Longoria but have never even heard of Lake Bell. When I actually started to watch the movie and Lake Bell was introduced I was hoping she wasn't the leading lady. WOW! She is horrible!! Not nice to look at and definitely not a good actress. She brought down the quality of the movie single handedly. I hate to be so hard on someone but Lake Bell deserves much worse. Her performance was torture to watch and half way through I wanted to turn off the movie, I hoped it would get better but by the end I was just upset that I had lost the time in my life watching it. Its such a shame they used such a horrible actress as Lake Bell.... seriously... anyone would have done a better job!"
1,Don't spend the time or money on this one!,"I love Eva but this movie was disappointing. I am addicted to Desperate Houswives and a big fan but this movie (+ her acting) did not do her justice. She looked like she had the worse fake tan and the movie just lacked humor and romance! So much for a romantic comedy!This is just a remake of ""Just Like Heaven"" featuring Reese Witherspoon, which had a better plot and acting. If you are into these kinds of movies I recommend that one over this one.I don't know how anyone could rate this movie higher than 1 star!Sadly, it was a waste of money and time!"
3,Amusing if you first check your brain at the door,"This film is very silly, but offers a couple of hours of entertainment if you don't expect much. Paul rudd is one of america's most underrated comic actors and Lake Bell holds her own. But Eva Longoria's acting is pretty terrible. It might be okay if she really was beautiful. She comes actoss as annoyingly arrogant and bitchy. That might have worked, but her role is undermined by the ridiculously contradictory ending that is obvious halfway through the film. My wife gave the film four stars, though."
1,What were they thinking?,"For me this movie fails on all fronts: on the writing, the directing and the acting. Clearly Lake Bell was a Debra Messing substitute--then you have to wonder who would write a script for a B-listed movie star. There's nothing believable or cute about this whole premise. Plus, the dead chick and the groom seems like a mismatch in the first place. Does anyone really believe that Longoria and Rudd character's dated-much less-were heading down the aisle? And poor Ms. Bell. She was clearly giving this role her all, but the clutzy character doesn't suit her well. She should have stayed over at Boston Legal. As a romantic Comedy this just missed the mark all the way around."
4,not as bad as you would think,"my wife got this and i was dragging my feet to watch it with her. then i had some work to do on my laptop and so i told her to put it on so that i could work and (pretend to) watch it with her. but 15 minutes into the movie, i was actively watching it. i don't have to go over the plot as many people have already done it here. some of the scenes are outright funny and the film does do a respectable job keeping the viewer engaged. though she seems a bit manly i'm sure we are going to see more of lake bell in the years to come. not bad at all!"
3,Mildly amusing but nothing special.,"Eva Longoria Parker did an excellent job as a control-freak bridezilla, who nicely segwayed into a control-freak ghost, haunting her groom's new girlfriend. Of all the ghost-themed movies, this was definitely the silliest, with the ghost playing juvenile practical jokes on her hauntee, along with the two getting into wisecracking cat fights. Between practical jokes and verbal cat fights though, the movie sagged. Paul Rudd as the grieving groom was a nice guy with a good sense of humor and of course better looking than average, and Lake Bell did an okay job as the klutzy psychic girlfriend. But really, this was a one actor movie--Eva Longoria Parker. The movie was mildly amusing, but nothing special."
1,Definitely NOT tangle-free. Very thin and flimsy cable.,"Not tangle free, and not heavy enough for my 30 lb beagle mix, even though it says it is rated for dogs up to 35 lbs. Maybe it would be ok if you have a dog that never pulls and doesn't run around like a maniac. I am afraid he is going to snap the ends off it one of these times when he pulls on it, and I swear he can get this thing tied in knots in under 5 seconds. Because it is so flimsy, it is like spaghetti to try to untangle it.EDIT: I lowered my stars on this one, because less than a month after receiving it, the plastic coating is peeling off the cable in spots, which is what causes the cable to rust and fail. Also, one of the clips is starting to pull apart. Will not order this again. Heavier cables are a must, for one thing, this is VERY thin and flimsy, and only for the very smallest of dogs that don't have the strength to pull on it."
3,"Make sure she likes crafts for the journey, not the destination","I liked this product overall, which was good since I and my sisters-in-law did a lot of the work. My niece (who is six- may have been a little young for the product) really liked the idea of making the quilt, but wanted the product to be finished ""yesterday."" She did help and was able to pick up the fairly easy knotting technique quickly, cutting down on frustration.Upon finishing it, she was very happy to be able to say she made it, so in that aspect it beats a traditional present by a mile. Yes, I could have gotten her a fleece blanket with some pattern (which is what it is; it can't be compared to actual quilting), but she was much more excited about this.Would buy again."
4,6 Year old daughter,My daughter works on this project with her mother. Like a quilt it takes time to complete the project. She seems to enjoy it. A great value.
4,great gift,My niece loved this project and loved the finished product! it is a great gift for those creative type children.
2,A total disaster,I got this for Christmas and I thought it was a great gift when I opened it. When I got started it was the easiest part. When I tried tying four squares together I got frustrated and quit for the day. The second day was even more frustrating and my Mom and older sister finished it for me. Yet today I don't even use it because it isn't warm or cute.
2,Wanted to like this,"I really wanted to like this quilt. It's a cute idea, and seems easy enough. But the problems are those that everyone else has already said. The fringe pieces are too short to tie easily. My daughter got this when she had just turned 7 and it's too difficult for her to do, so *I'm* doing it. She's the designer, I'm the worker. Awesome. She's very excited about the quilt, just wish that it would've worked out so she could have made it."
3,alex knot a quilt,"fringe is sometimes hard to knot as too short not really a toy , so no educational value but ok to make, fingers need to be very nimble"
2,Great idea but inferior fabric,"I ordered two of these kits as a gift for my niece with the idea that she could combine them and make a nice lap quilt. When they arrived, I was very disappointed to see the fabric was thin - more like something you would make pajamas out of. I was expecting the kit to be made of fleece to make a warm and cuddly blanket. Instead, it was more like knit flannel. I returned the kits and will keep looking."
2,Knot So Happy,"From 10 yo DD: It looked really fun and the colors are really cool. The tabs are short, fat and right next to each other, making them difficult to tie. It's hard to get the knot right: too tight puckers, too loose leaves a hole. Some of the colors are more stretchy than others. Some tabs lose their shape when being tied. From me: This was overpriced for the quality. What should have been a good road trip activity was a bust that took up space."
4,Daughter loves it!,My 11 year old daughter is having fun with this and has asked friends to join her to start a quilt business! We have ordered additional kits so she can add to her collection. It helps with their motor skills and is very durable.
3,plenty large,"I got this for my 11-yr-old granddaughter. Due to one review that the product was not big enough for the reviewer's granddaughter, I bought two of them...thinking of making one XL quilt. Actually, one was plenty big for my granddaughter (who is not small) to use as a lap quilt. She enjoyed working on it and we did a good portion together. Then, of course, she decided I wasn't working fast enough for her, so she finished by herself!"
4,may not be for younger girls,My daughter is 5 and the ties are short and therefore a little hard for her to do since they are so close to eachother. She loves it but gets frustrated.
2,Not a good idea.,The quilt squares are starting to unravel as the knots are being tied. The fringes are so short it is difficult to make the knots to make the quilt. I don't recommend this for anyone.
2,Fringe too short,"This is a great idea in theory, but the fringe in our kit is too short to knot easily. It's difficult for an adult, let alone a child. If the cuts were longer, then we wouldn't have had to pull and stretch to get enough material to make knots. There wouldn't be puckers. Funny that the fringe in the video was plenty long."
2,Frustrating!!!!!!,"When I bought ""Knot-a-quilt"" I was extremely excited to open it and make a new quilt. I bought the product because my older sister had said ""AMAZING!! I LOVE THE RESULTS!!"" However,this product is so hard, even to tie a knot. The fringe is BARELY long enough to do so. The toy is a project and I understand the point of the product is to have a hard project, but for the younger ones it should be at least doable. What I wanted to know before I bought the product was if it was too complicated or not. I recommend you save your money and buy something better,easier, and more fun, if you want to knot a quilt."
5,I've always wanted a homemade quilt!,"I first thought this would only be appropriate for children, but I then read a review from a reader that she bought 2 kits to make an adult size quilt. Well, I was up for the challenge. My sewing skills are not that great, but I knew I could tie knots. I laid out the squares and got to work. I laid out a nice pattern and got to knotting. It took me a little over a week and with a lot of encouragement, I made a beautiful adult size quilt. This quilt (which was made at the end of October) still stops people in their tracks and they ask me where I got it. I currently live in a nursing home and I make sure that I have something to do in order to keep myself busy. I intend to keep this where ever I end up next.I am 45 years old and I am proud to say this kit is not only for the young, but for the young at heart!"
2,Don't Bother,"In theory, this is a great product. The quality, as stated in many of the reviews, is poor. Depending on the color of the square, you get varying lengths for tying. Unfortunately my 7 year old got the yellow - the shortest of all the colors. After 20 minutes, she quit in frustration. I've been working on it for two hours and am no where near finished. The fabric begins to fray almost immediately after the tying process begins. I'm glad I purchased this on sale, but it would have been cheaper and of a much higher quality to purchase fleece from a fabric store to make your own."
2,"Good concept, poor execution","This looked like a good project for my children, who have learned to tie things. But upon further examination, and trying it myself, I have to conclude that this is not a good project at all. The fringe is way too short for a child to manipulate into a knot - in fact, it is difficult for me! If this quilt is to be finished, it will be me doing it, because the tying will be too hard for them and they will lose interest very quickly. And I am quickly losing interest as well because it is so difficult. If the fringe were twice as long it would be much better, but the squares would then have to be larger also."
2,Alex Toys Knot-A-Quilt,I found the material to be thin and not satisfactory. I ended up purchasing fleece in a fabric store and making my own quilt.
1,Very difficult material to work with,I purchased this for my almost 7-year-old daughter. The fringe for knotting is super small and she couldn't get the knots in. The polyester fleece is paper thin and if you pull the knots too tight they stretch/tear. The finished product is not warm. My daughter does like the completed product (completed by her Grandmother). Do not mistake this for anything similar to the fleece projects available with two warm layers attached together.
1,This Item is a waste of money,"I bought this Item for my nine year old Grandaughter for Christmas. The only thing it did for her was make her feel bad about herself. I decided to give it a try. I told her it wasn't her fault- the strings aren't long enough and very flimsy and stretchable. Patents don't waste your money, It will never look like the picture and your child will just be disappointed."
4,Cute and fun all in one!,Knot A Quilt is an fun project for a child of around 7 or 8 years old. No messy supplies are needed. All you do is make knots. The kit makes a nice sized throw and it is super soft.We used one kit to make 2 baby blankets for our newborn neice and her year old Brother. I had to order more as my kids each wanted one.This is a craft they will enjoy!
2,Difficult to knot!!,"I bought this for my 9yo daughter for Christmas last year and it still sits in her art cabinet. The strips are too short and too close together to tie, even for an adult. It is a very fustrating project to work on for a child. My daughter has found other creative uses for the squares, which I am pleased about, but the intended use (and $30) got made into a pile of scrap material (which I could have gotten more scrap material for my money at Wal-Mart). I do not recommend unless you have infinate patience."
3,A long wait,"For years I collect Ava Gardner movies and books and this film was not available on DVDNot the best of movies, but my diva was off course beautiful as always.Just a view films to go!package and delivery were good."
2,mugs crack in the freezer,"I've received 4 of these mugs as gifts over the last several months. I've always washed them by hand, dried them (sometimes by hand, sometimes air dry overnight), and placed them in the freezer for future use.The first failure was the top end of a handle that came loose. After another use or two, that mug cracked, across the bottom of the mug and almost all the way up the outside, but not at the handle location.Now two of the remaining three have cracked in the freezer after several uses. Both cracked across the bottom and all the way up the side, at the handle.They were good while they lasted, but they didn't last long. I'm still using the fourth mug, but probably not for much longer."
2,Decent Album,Actually the Amazon review is wrong.This is there first album in 3 years.[]Among the trees in 2004 was there last album.And [Heroes of the harvest] the album before that in 2001.This album is decent.But the previous album Among the trees is hands down the best album of there career.Even better than there debut album.But was not heard of by many of even there core fans.This album certainly misses Arrested Developments secret weapon.There supporting rapper One love.I don't know his real name.But he is a excellent more main stream sounding rapper than Speech who is a good rapper. Also the songs on here are not even close in quality as the Among the trees CD.Also Strong there Album that came out in 2010 is a better album also.
4,Good Vibes,"This is a real good mood album all the tracks have a certain energy about them. Speech is still spittin knowledge but not preaching. I am so glad I bought this album, the first 7 songs are monstas they are what really reeled me in. Tracks 8-10 are average in a good way but it seems like they are doing their best Outkast impersonation and the songs are out of place. Things pick back up at 11-12 so over half the album is bangin. Let's support good Hip Hop music, go buy this album. Hotep!!!"
4,Illusions of Sanity,"This slim little chapbook is a departure from Burk's previous offering, Strange Twists of Fate. While Strange Twists was full of humor, Illusions of Sanity explores thedark, horror side of writing.The strongest story of the three included is ""Mirror, Mirror"". The horror of this piece depends more on the very real horror of life in a mental institution rather than on its more fantastic elements.The weakest of the three is ""This Old House"", a fairly standard story of the type that you've read or seen before, the mysterious old house that refuses to allow its occupants ot leave. It is, nevertheless, well written and smooth.Of the third story, ""Nightmare Prince"", I can only say , ""Blast you James Burk, I may never sleep again""."
2,The Worst Game Ever!,"This is the worst game ever. Most of the ""extra surfers"" are ones that I have never heard of. Some of the challenges are stupid, like jump over a pier. I would only reccommend it for people who are bored enough."
1,birds of prey,"why did they change the original sound track?the meaning of the move changed completely.they need to put back the original sound track,then it would be a five star movie"
3,Quo Vadis - Ali MacGraw,"Ali MacGraw, describes her life's unfolding, a lovely soul who became a spoilt Hollywood siren, who then crashed in alcoholic self-indulgence, then setting out to discover self-truth and integrity. The book has a lot of new age sentiment to it, reconciling Ali's difficult past with an appreciation for the relative tranquility and groundedness of the present. It is a good read, honest and compelling."
3,should have hired a writer to help her,"While I liked the book enough to finish it, the writing was very poor and the time line all over the place. Sad story of an insecure star who has so much beauty and talent that went to waste while she looked for love in men who were selfish and addictive. Honestly, can't recommend the book unless you are big fan of hers."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Rosemary Sutcliff takes the material from the epic poem Beowulf, andturns it into a prose novel aimed at young readers. She follows the manthrough the three major confrontations he has with some very seriousbeasties.A story about dedication, bravery, duty and honor, and those who choose to uphold it."
3,Way too big,The mug is fine construction-wise but it is way to big and takes up too much room in my freezer.
4,well executed portrait of a country in turmoil,"A football player falls in with a crowd of politically active peers in Allende's Chile. He struts and preens and claims to be above politics until the mad tides of history sweep up all of them. As the country devolves into a nightmare of violence, political assassinations and turmoil his transformation begins.Skarmeta portrays a lovely ensemble of personalities and, without waxing too sentimental, shows how ordinary people's lives are tossed by painful, violent change. A quick read, rewarding.The plot makes more sense if you can do a bit of reading on the Allende overthrow of 1973 as well."
3,Review of Multicultural Folktales for All Ages,"These are lovely stories with insightful commentary by authors after each story. We are using the book for Unitarian religious education program, the moral lessons are so relevant to life here today. Have met one author Lisa Galang, one of the brightest most enthusiatic writers and speakers I have ever met. This book is a treasure in our house."
4,Nicely done snorkeling guide,This is a snorkelers go-to guide for Michigan lakes. The information is great (could use more photos). However this book was written several years ago and I wonder how accurate it is now. I wish she would write an updated version.
1,Don't waste your time or money,This book is more of the authors editorializing than teaching what you need for the A+ Certification. I found more valuable information on line for free. The material was scattered throughout the book. The index and glossary were lacking terms that were common in the Transcender test prep software. I did pass the exams.
2,This book is for heavy novices,"This book is excellent if you don't know squat about computers. Now if you dont know squat then why you taking the A+. So you can get a job and ruin someone computers?? Noway.. Learn computers from experience before taking A+. I am A+. I bought this book, and read the first chapter before giving up.. It was so basic. I took the test the next day and passed easily.. So this book is not worth the money if you have expereince with computers. But if your a idiot at computers, well use this book and good luck!!"
5,One of Fellini's Best,"This is my personal favorite Fellini film. His exercises in cinematic self-reflexivity and artistic subjectivity are wholly successful here, and the film is filled with sequences that never fail to inspire curiosity, amusement, and fascination. While there's no shortage of the grotesque, eerily dream-like images that have come to be regarded as ""Felliniesque"", there is also a great deal of warmth that's impossible to dislike. If you like this film, you should also watch ""Roma"", which similiarly parodies the pretensions of documentary films within a relatively non-linear framework.A true classic!"
4,"Uneven, sentimental, but with breath-taking sequences","Originally made for TV, this film has some real dry patches (the scripted pseudo-documentary sections of Fellini & his film crew are particularly arch), but it's all worth it for the moments of absolutely heart-stopping wonder it contains. When this film was first released theatrically in the U.S., I returned to see it repeatedly just to watch the AUDIENCE at the moment when the ""dead"" clown, visibly harnessed, lifts off the neck of the giant champagne bottle and begins swinging around the soundstage as millions of streamers shoot down. Ya gotta be there. Probably far more effective on the large screen, as a communal audience experience, but don't let that stop you from viewing it on video."
3,"""The Clowns"" is not what it appears to be.","May Morin's documentary ""The Clowns"" is not what it appears to be. My expectationwhen ordering was that I would get a chance to see some of the great clowns of history at their best and, of course, laugh at their famous antics. But there wasvery little that was funny in the DVD. Mostly it was concerned with their privatelives and with the decisions of those who hired and directed their careers. All ofthis was interesting, but somewhat disappointing."
5,Better than the original,"This 20th anniversary edition is better than the original in many ways. While there are still some really glaring errors, the poetry and beauty of this book mades them something one can work around.HOWEVER, this book deserves a context. Read it for what it is, and don't make it out to be more than what it is...I recommend it for older, more mature students, with study and history behind them."
3,"First, separate the topics...","Putting aside the strongly feminist and political sides (even Starhwak in this new edition tried to do that), is a very well written and documented book. The concepts of inmanence and ""perfect love and perfect trust"" are very well explained and comprehended by Starhawk. In fact, is a reminder for us, the old line, that the last lesson, after all the roads travelled and the uses of energy, is that to be whole, you need of somebody else. Very entertaining book, specially to know all the things some have to do to feel and control the magic that we are."
4,"Excellent if you want to start a coven/circle, but...","This book was not my first ""witchy"" book, but I did find it very inspiring in many ways. However, I am a solitary, and so much of this book seemed geared towards group/community settings. Excellent ideas, and I think that this book is great for mix-and-match...no one book says it all. I am very glad I own it; it is a permanent fixture in my bookshelf."
2,"Another ""do it yourself"" book","I am a studant of gardnerian wicca and I like when elders says: ""keep wicca traditional"".this is a book of recipes, another one book of a ecletic, self-initiated ""wicca"" (or witch, or reclaiming, whatever).Is poor in poetry and in rituals. I only take 5% useful from all this pages. I consider this book the same fluffy wicca started by Scott Cunningham.For youngs who want start in practice of wicca, very well, but only for start as curious and a dedicant, this can't show you what wicca really is.It is a joke to sincere seekers, is an outrage to elders."
1,Evil,"I bought this for a friend who had it recommended to her. When she found out it was about witchcraft, she immediately burned it in her driveway. A good case for knowing what you are buying before you order."
4,Enlightened64,This is an awesome book! I purchased this book to replace my older one which was falling apart from use.
5,Very good.,I really enjoyed this book the first time it was published. The second printing was very interesting because we got to see how much Starhawk evolved as a spiritual being
3,"Wonderful book, if your a Women","The book is definitly well worth the buy for the information, and rituals in it...But if you are a male, or even a non-feminist I would stay away...The book is mainly geared towards WOMENs Spirituality, and focuses mainly on that throughout the book"
2,Pretty feministic,"I would have rated this book as average, it is a good overview of the Wicca religion system, is organized pretty well etc., and is easy and quick to read - I finished the book almost in a day, but the book proved to be full of Starhawk's own opinions that degrade men's position and counterpoints herself in many occasions. For example, first stating that a society shouldn't be leaded and certainly by no men and then later in the book stating that men's role is to limit and restrict females, behaving a sort like Lord Shiva in Hindu literature, dancing the dance of destruction. The book in essence seemed to be more a political book than a book on a religion system flavored with Starhawk's own anxiety - not a good way to promote a religion."
2,The Spiral Dance is NOT Wicca,"It is true that this book has had an impact on modern Wicca, but it is also the simple truth that Starhawk's ""The Spiral Dance"" and ""Reclaiming Tradition"" are not actually Wiccan, was inspired by a faddish notion of an ancient Goddess Monotheism and utopia that has no basis in reality, and is more a political movement than a spiritual movement."
2,"good in ways, irresponsible in others","_Spiral Dance_ would be a fine introductory book for people interested in Wiccan and neo-paganism if Starhawk had the discipline to confine herself to the topic. Unfortunately, this eminently public pagan author considers it acceptable to use this opportunity to preach her particular version of ecofeminism. The implication for the person new to paganism is clear: ""These are the orthodox social, political and ecological attitudes of the modern neo-pagan, and if you want to be a pagan and they aren't your attitudes, you'd better acquire them.""This is as much a socio-political book as an introductory treatise, and I'm disappointed at the disguise. She has written other books which are unabashedly political and with these I have no quarrel. I happen to share a fair number of Starhawk's views, but I believe that one can be a responsible pagan and disagree with Starhawk's personal take on society."
3,Not bad.,"This is a good book if you are looking into the Goddess-worshipping religions of the world. However, this book doesn't have a lot of non-Goddess-based magick, so you may want to shop around. Either way, this book is a good read, but it's aimed at a specific demographic."
5,this book got me hooked on Wicca,"This is one of the first books I read on Wicca, and it blew my socks off! Every third or fourth page, I thought, ""This is me! This is how I feel about things. I'm not alone anymore!"" For me, this book was transcendent. It changed my life for the better. That it centers on the Goddess is not an issue for me, and should not be for others either, IMHO. Her idea of Goddess encompasses the God. Anyway, I don't like attaching a gender to Deity, but that is just me I guess. Excellent book. I highly recommend it to those seeking information on what it _means_ to be a witch."
5,Wonderful book!,I enjoyed this book a lot. It gives a you a look at the positive aspects of Wicca and helps diffuse the myths that most people believe about witchcraft.
5,Excellent Book for Beginners,"This book serves two great purposes. It is one of the first major books on Wicca when it exploded into public consciousness, combining the mystical with a lived political ethic. It is also a primer for beginners providing two decades worth of evolution of thought by Starhawk. I enjoyed every edition and Starhawk's willingness to share how she has grown and changed her understanding (and history). Excellent book!"
5,"Liberates Goddess worship from the English ""traditions""","This is the book that really made the modern Goddess movement possible by giving people permission to look beyond the Gardnerian/Alexandrian model to create a path that worked for them. I have nothing against the English traditions or any other traditions for that matter, but to live a religion must be free to evolve. That's whats wrong with Christianity; its evolution into something fit for the 21st Century is being hindered. It would be a terrible shame if the same fate befell Goddess worship, but as long as people are free to try out new variations on the age-old themes that won't happen. The exercises in this book help people get in touch with their innermost selves to come up with something both new and authentic."
3,Excellent Exercises,"The exercises in this book are exceptional, very basic, and easy to do either on your own or in a group.That being said, the rest of this book gets rather questionable.Reading through it you get the impression that you can cut most of it out as Starhawk's own rather political point of view. Some of it is really good information on Faery Wicca, but most of it is just Starhawk and her groups throughout the years.I still recommend this book for its exercises and some of its content, but that I can only strongly recommend it for its exercises and lightly recommend it for some of its content keeps me from rating it more than 3 stars."
5,Overall great book,This is one of best books i have read and a great source for teaching students ..
3,Don't Start With This One,I would not recommend this book for someone starting out because it doesn't go in depth enough about meditation and witchcraft as a science. If you have a bit of experience and want more ideas for rituals this book is handy to have around.
5,An excelent book.,THE book for anyone interested in learning about witchcraft. This book changed the way I see the world we live in.
2,Divergence by a feminist Jewish woman.,"I first read the original edition many years ago when I was just discovering Wicca and it was all the rage. Starhawk's Spiral Dance inspired a huge number of young women to become Wiccan but with a price. Wicca is a religion of harmony and balance between God and Goddess, it is not a ""Goddess religion."" Nor is there a real place in Wicca for feminist men-bashing and separatist misandry. For two decades many people believed that Wicca was a ""women's spirituality"" rather than a balanced and harmonious religion for everyone. What was gained by the beautiful writing and poetic mysticism is lost in the divisiveness and misdirection. The original edition of Spiral Dance wasn't as polarized and hateful to men as later works by Starhawk or the more recent revisions of the Dance. If one can get past her misandry she has a lot of creative vision. It isn't another spell book, and that part is good. But in the end she has never given up being Jewish."
3,"Thank you, Starhawk!","Thank you, Starhawk! You've managed to give Wicca as much embarrassing political baggage as Christianity ever had... Pagans who make their political beliefs so sacred that the thought of compromise with neighbours becomes impossible; pagans who think their neighbours too lost in ""false consciousness"" to be worth trying to persuade; pagans who react to questions with rage. Instead, they too await some kind of apocalyptic social upheaval, hoping it might all lead to utopia afterwards. And until the apocalypse comes, they lose themselves in a reverie of bogus history as a paranoid fantasy of persecution. If I wanted that, I'd read Butler's Lives of the Saints.Starhawk's witches and Pat Robertson's fundamentalists deserve each other."
2,Feminist politics,"I know every witch owns this book. I own this book. But I have to say that reading it left me feeling disenchanted. I have read many books by male wiccan authors and none of them have ever come close to the sexism that I encountered in this book. I am a woman, and i was offended. My boyfriend is pagan, I have more male pagan friends than female ones, (which I realize is unusual.) This book makes me sad because I, personally, have seen more men passionatly dedicated to the Goddess than women. This book, and ones like it, made a few of my pagan friends just not want to be pagan anymore. They said that they felt there was no room for them in Goddess religions. It's on my shelf, but it will never have a place in my heart."
3,"Lacked accuracy, but still good","I'll stay anonymous because it's safer :) Starhawk has some problems with her history (as all pagan authors do), and her sources were out of date when she wrote the book. Many had been discredited, and several were simply bad to start with. Her insistance on using oral tradition rather than hard evidence detracts from her writing. She also seems to believe that Witchcraft is the only way for a person (particularly a woman) to go religiously, calls all Eastern religions cults, and would probably insult most men who read it. Aside from this, her work is still good and useful, showing women how to empower themselves using the symbolism of the Goddess. The rituals and meditations are useful; stick to those if you get the book."
5,A must get.,"If you can only get one book on Wicca, make sure it's this one. Comprehensive, sensitive treatment of the Old Religion. I reread this one constantly and continue to get more out of it. A must have for the library of anyone interested in or involved in Wicca and paganism."
4,My first Witchy Book..,"Like many others this is the first ever Witchy book I laid my eyes and mind upon. The Creation Myth within the book is what did it for me .. it was beautiful, poetic, inspiring. Unlike the 'Christian' one I was brought up to 'believe'.Even tho' I am now (after 4 or so yrs) no longer Wiccan (per say) I still use it for the Elemental Meditations and other various exercises.It's well worth getting not just for the information and insights but for the exercises which have helped me more than once!I especially like Starhawk's insights into how she has grown/changed in the time after the book was first published."
3,"By Far, THE ultimate book for every pagan","Ummm...OK, I just wiped the slate clean, and let's start over. After rereading my review, I can understand the 0 out of 2 responses. I wouldn't myself~Now. Yes, it's a classic. Yes, a very good primer, and reference, as well as workbook. In all, overall, it's a very well rounded book.NOW:It's feminist, repetitive, not orderly, AAAAND Miriam *StarHawk* actually has the GALL to flub up a very, VERY important part in the Circle Casting ritual. For a beginner who doesn't know any better, it could prove catastrophic.She tells you to purify the Circle, AFTER you invoke all the guests for dinner. THEN you basically toss water on their faces when they arrive in a dusty, dirty Circle. I don't think they'd be too happy.OK. There you have it. Happy now?"
4,starhawk,this book contains a lot of information about the Dianic Tradition and a lot of good meditation techniques.
3,"An all together ""OK"" book I guess...","The information given in ""The Spiral Dance"" really isn't anything extrodinary. Most you can find in any other basic pagan book (notice I never said wicca....). To tell you the truth if this had been the first pagan book I has stumbled upoln I probable would not be pagan today. From the start the author doesn't really draw you in. In other words, I could put it down and really didn't learn much...."
4,Bang for your student loan buck!,"This is a great reference. I've used it for each research assignment I've had while in my DPT program. The book is very well organized. Each of the 16 chapters contains objectives, chapter terms, an introduction, core content, a chapter summary, and review questions. The index is also very comprehensive. The author's presentation of the content is excellent. She is able to covey dry content with the utmost clarity. I wouldn't recommend trying to read this book like a novel, but it acts as a very user friendly reference. Whether your goal is to the the ""Grand-Pooh-Ba"" of Evidence-Based Practice or to just be able to hold your own when it comes to p-values, this text is a worthwhile investment."
5,"Solid, pleasant mystery","This book, while 60+ years old, is still readable and good company. While not exciting or terribly suspenseful, it finds occupies a middle ground we don't see much anymore-- intelligence without political or social agendas, accuracy without tedious (and often rather graphic) detail, and a good story, well written and plotted.In comparison to other mysteries of the same period, this veers more towards Agatha Christie than Dorothy Sayers, but is by no means as formulaic as Christie's works."
4,Decent historical analysis,"This is not a pop-history book. I picked this book up expecting it to be a very easy read but was surprised when I found myself reading through a book that would not have been out of place in any of my college history courses. Fraser has painted a very fascinating picture of various warrior queens around the world. Though at times, the narrative drags through her meticulous statement of facts, that is to be expected. I was very disappointed at her omission of the Egyptian pharaoh-queen Hatshepsut, however. Nevertheless, the women that she picks to include in her analysis make up a very good overview of the various warrior queens throughout the world and through time. It was an extremely interesting read and I would recommend it for anyone who has an interest in historical women as well as the the patience to read a (mostly) scholarly work."
1,An attempted read,"Perhaps I expected more from this book than was present, but I could hardly get through the first few chapters and I am an avid historic biography reader. I found her methods tiresome and boring, having the preference to recite found facts rather than compile and share, she reads like a card catalog. I now know exactly what to read if I do wish to learn something of these women she eludes to, but after having put this book down, I feel I am less wise to the subjects then when I started. I need a chronological telling of a person and their movement, not a forty-three page explanation of exactly who has written such things in the past. Perhaps, I stopped reading three or four chapters before it got good, but I doubt it. I was very disappointed."
1,"Interesting subject matter, however...","I was excited to jump into this book because I find the subject matter interesting, but I was repeatedly brought to a stand still by Fraser's laborious prose. I found that she continuously sacrificed clarity, succinctness, and organization in order to indulge in unnecessary drama and lyricism. The latter should never come at the expense of the former in a history book. Furthermore, in my opinion, the constant psychoanalytical references to various syndromes in application to the historical figures themselves was tiresome and sophomoric.I would recommend trying to get the information elsewhere."
5,Fits 2007 Ford Focus Hatchback,"Took me forever to track down the proper part, but this fits the hatchback of my 2007 Ford Focus (3 door). VERY easy to install. Pull the clip out of the olds ones (use a phillips head screwdriver to pry it out). Once the olds ones are out you just push the new ones into place. (Note, you may need to turn the angle of the holes on the lifts. This is normal)"
2,diffcult game,"I have found conflict desert storm to be a fairly diffcult game to play. The graphics are ok. It is very hard to aim the rifle i think it was an m16, you can't run and shot easliy. I had it on the easy level and i could not get the half way point. If you fail to complete the mission the game has to be reloaded it takes two to three minutes. There are no checkpoints along the way.If i had to do it over i would not have bought desert storm. I would wait until november 15 for metal of honor to come out or the new james bond game to come out, which if it is anything like the first Bond game (agent under fire) it is a can't miss game."
2,Less than mediocre,"This game looked great.Going through warzones with cool weaponry and some driveable vehicles here and there.I then bought this game and this is what a realized:the graphics are outdated looking,the aiming is horrible,the team commanding is not that fun(you feel like you barely even have a team.)Also the bullets look like lazers going across the screen.This also looked cool because you could be SAS and Delta Force:the only difference was SAS had British accents, and Delta Force had American.I would recommend SOCOM II or Ghost Recon over this bad."
2,Let Down,I just got through playing Splinter Cell. This Game was a complete let down. The movement of the soilder is choppy and un-responsive. No realism what so ever. As an arcade shooter its probably OK. If you've played S.C. Don't expect much!
1,Terrible controls,"The graphics are great, but the controls absolutely stink. If the controls were the same like for the James Bond games it would be great. Unfortunately the controls are terrible and I dont recommend this game because of that. I have been playing video games for 12 years now and I couldnt even make the guy move straight or aim straight."
2,"conflict on the system,big time!","OK i might be the only one here but I really do think this game sucks Iv tried to deny it for so long but I cant hold it in any longer!#1 This is probably the worst game I have ever played graphicly(belive me Iv played alot of those).Its like ""why does everyone look the same?"".Although I must say there is a pretty nice array of weapons but they feel so repetetive, I think one weapon in the entire game is silenced!Also I think this game could be pretty good if your squdmates werent such idiots,they dont even follow your commands!but 2 player is good."
4,"Good, not great. Fun game, but poor graphics","Unfortunately another game that does not take advantage of what could be done on the xbox (that's why I bought the xbox to begin with). The graphics are not very clear or realistic and actually very simple.This otherwise is a great game that is worth buying even at full price, full of several fun action filled levels that really hold your interest. Weapons are fun to use and numerous, and the storyline is fun as well.A shame that this game would not look any different if played on playstation."
2,really bad,Your first clue as to how bad this game will prove is when you begin a 2 player multiplayer game and one of the players sits able to do nothing in a prison cell until you spend 15 minutes finding the prison. The graphics are horrid and the game play is lame with mindless searching in circa-1990 graphics representing a sand storm.
3,Worth a second look.,"Alright, I have to admit that the first time I played this it took me about a half an hour before I got bored and put the controller down. After a couple of days passed I decided to try it again. Having more time to get in to the game, I was able to master the controls and start thinking like a soldier. The graphics could be a whole lot better given the capabilities of the Xbox but the game play is rather addictive once you get in to it. I really like the promotions and the awrds that are given out after each mission. In the future I would love to see a sequel to this game that takes advantage of the full graphics capabilities of the Xbox. All in all, a fun game."
4,Cute. Unique. Fun.,"I first spied this ring on one of the contestant's on this season of Project Runway, and being into fashion and unusual pieces, I had to have one too :) I really like this ring because of its unusual look, although I have small hands so it is kind of conspicuous, but it is not tacky or anything. This also keeps very accurate time, and comes in a nice little black net drawstring bag."
5,RING WATCH:,I purchased this product as a Christmas Gift for my Sister. She loves unusual jewelery. When she opened this item...SHE FLIPPED. That made ME very happy. For some reason she doesn't take the ring off. I'm extremely satisfied with this product.
2,I little bulky...,"I really wanted to like this ring watch. It looks nice, just like the photo. The problem is if you have to work with your hands at all, this ring is not practical for everyday use. It just feels heavy and in the way. It has a very thick band, not feminine or pretty, just utilitarian. I threw the ring watch in a box a few days after I got it. I hate to say it, but I was disappointed..."
5,Great Watch!!!!!,"Just got this today. Had been looking for a new ring watch for at least six months. My old one died when I washed my hands with it on. This is a no no. Had looked in every store and on the web. So glad Amazon.com had it. This one is the best by far. It is a stretch type, but is not too tight. My last one cut into my finger after wearing it for a short time. The numbers (I got the black one) are easy to read. Does not sit up too high - just perfect for my needs."
2,Watch band broke after 2 weeks,"The watch was very pretty. The battery lasted about 3 days, and then i spent $12 for a new one, almost 1/2 the purchase price of the watch. I have small fingers and the band was a bit too big, so the watch didn't stay on tightly. After a couple of weeks, i snagged it on a grocery sack and the band broke. Would cost more to get the band fixed than to just buy a new one."
5,A fun piece of jewelry,"This watch is fun to wear, a conversation starter, and really works. I am planning to buy other colors. I would recommend it to others, with the warning of don't get it wet."
1,"Great idea, but not with these spices","This is a really good idea, and I hope the other sets from oxo work well. We got this for a wedding present, and I used it successfully a couple of times. Then it jammed. Now it jams up a lot. It takes a lot of fiddling to unjam it, since it doesn't come apart. I don't think its the quality of the grinder. It seems well made. I think the grinder just cannot handle hard spices, such as cinnamon bark and allspice berries. Too bad, because freshly ground cinnamon is yummy. This same idea probably would work on smaller, softer seeds, like fennel, cumin, coriander, etc."
5,2+ Years and Still Great,"I bought the water filter over two years ago, and never ran into any issues. From small villages in Myanmar and Laos to big cities in China I have never gotten sick from the filtered water. I easily drank more than 26 gallons, but never got sick or had a clogged filter so I kept on using it. As a precaution, I'm buying a replacement filter and having it shipped to me since Asia doesn't have a compatible version.One drawback is a moderate drinking pace, but it is adequate when squeezed. I prefer the filter over tablets since sometimes you only find a water source sporadically, and who wants to wait 45 minutes for the pill to activate?You do get some random inspections at airports if you carry it on, but no one has ever confiscated it."
3,Good flow but Iodine taste,"After having a similar product, the Aquamira, which used phyical filtering and had a glacially slow flow rate, literally a drip, I was wary of these water bottle type filters. I have found the flow rate for the katadyn is pretty good and easy to squeeze the bottle. My main issue is the iodine taste.I will stick with my filter with the pump. A bit more inconvenient as I was many wanting to use the katadyn while fishing clear trout waters."
3,Made me sick,Don't use this for an extended period of time... it causes stomach issues... bad stomach issuses
2,WHY!!!,"I love Blade 2 and when I bought this game, I thought it was going to be great. But it was not. The Graphics ar horrendous and dull. The controls are broken. It doesn't have a good camera angle. And to end this review, it gets so annoying so fast."
3,Its fun the first time but it has low replayability.,"This game is hard to find because it was released back in 2002 but if you get ahold of this game, you'll find it fun the first time you play it. the only problem is once you beat the game, you probably wont play it again. The numerous cheats for this game add a little bit of spice but overall, replayability is low.I suggest you only get this game if you are a Blade fan and/or enjoy short term-fulfilling games."
5,Stunning Book!,"This is one of the better books that you will ever read about World War II and the Jewish people. Blum follows three soldiers,Israel Carmi,Johanan Pelz,and Arie Pinchuk through this book. The British establish a Jewish Brigade at the end of the war. The Brigade sees some action against the Nazis and do very well. The three soldiers who are highlighted take on the role of avengers. By obtaining documentation of the identities of Gestapo members who were involved in Holocaust activities they begin a series of executions of the guilty parties. Many a Gestapo member is executed. After encountering a Jewish orphanchild the group becomes involved in getting Jewish people smuggled into Palestine. This activity plays a huge role in thefounding of Israel.This is a book that will make a huge impression on you.You are able to see the early days of the State of Israel.Buy this and read it.It is a keeper."
4,In the Beginning,"In reading of the exploits of the Jewish Brigade, it is possible to see the beginnings of the Israeli military's unorthodox style in everything from battle tactics to weapons procurement to espionage. It is not surprising then that many high ranking officers in the Isreali Defense Forces got their start in the Brigade. This is also a good book for those interested in Jewish efforts to circumvent the British attempt to prevent the survivors of the holocaust from reaching Palestine."
4,Another untold story of WWII,"I am a fan of the untold, small stories in war - whether different fronts, units or individual stories beyond what we are inundated with. Blum, in Brigade, tells a great story of the Jewish Brigade and their reasons for fighting despite the fact that they were relatively safe in Israel. He uses a good mixture of biographical discussion, tactics and the history of the war to show how effective this brigade was but also how politically risky their use ended up being. I very much enjoyed this book."
4,Great Book,Enjoyed this book. Great mystery/suspense with the right level of romance. Great ending. Anita .... keep them comming!!!
4,A police box set-pinch me please!,"The Police are one of the best bands ever. They are one of the tightest trios ever to have recorded a note. The tempo of their music changes with every song, and in their words,""This box set has it all, every single note""And that it does, although I was a little peaved there wasn't more live material, as this is where they were at their absolute best. But they are true to their word, you can hear everynote, including some of the stuff they don't want you to hear. They review each track in the superb book included, in which they critique every song honestly.All in all, for a Police fan, BUY IT NOW! For a casual fan, buy a best of album. Good work boys!"
4,Just curious..,"I know this box is the ""complete"" recordings. But some reviewers have mentioned how a few things have been left out. I'm also just wondering here..the last track on disc 4 for is ""Don't Stand So Close To Me 86"". Is this the same version from the ""Every breath you take, the classics""? From internet downloads, the version from the box is over 6 mins long. The one from ""every breath you take the classics"" is under 5. Just curious. Sometimes internet downloads are incorrect. Any info would be nice."
4,WHERE'S THE FINAL TRACK?,"Great box set, excellent value for your money. Not every track is on here as stated by the liner notes! Where is the live version of ""Don't Stand So Close To Me"" that was the b-side of the ""Don't Stand So Close To Me '86"" single?"
4,The only flaw is organization,"The sound quality on the remastered discs is very good. However, splitting Regatta de Blanc across two discs is inexcusable, and including susbstandard non-album tracks between albums is distracting. I recommend using a CD recorder to reassemble the 5 original albums onto separate discs, and creating a 6th disc with the bonus material that you can stand to listen to. Some of the bonus material is genius; some is dreck."
5,History Lesson,"Greatest Hits albums always show you the shining moments of each band, often while leaving out some of the bands' own favorite songs, in favor of the commercial hits. This is a complete portfolio, warts and all, that demonstrates the evolution of the band as musicians, songwriters, and people. True fans will appreciate this aspect as much as the songs themselves."
4,"BAN ""Don't stand so close to me 86'""!!","I just bought this set, but I am anticipating it to be really good. will be great to have all of these songs in one set! However, I'm planning to program my cd player to ALWAYS skip track 18 on disc 4, ""Dont' stand so close to me 86'"". THISRE-DOING OF THE SONG IS AN ABOMINATION! Please, if you are a person of any musical taste, always avoid this song. Participtate in this ban!! I first heard this piece of trash when I bought the greatest hits record back in the 80's--I always wondered why they put this song on their instead of the original, which was far superior and without any need to be ""re-done."" Why did sting do this this? If I could break into the archives at A&M and erase the master, I certainly would--what a pleasure it would be!"
5,Do you remember how great they were?,"Can you answer this question by getting the single CD greatest hits or do you need to splurge for this Anthology? I debated this for 6 months (not full-time), let the songs run through my head and then (with the help of a gift certificate) went deluxe. If you remember these as albums, then you cannot give up those catchy oddballs like 'Man in a Suitcase', 'Bombs away' and dozens of others that you'd miss on the abridged version. I know that if I had choosen to skimp, I'd eventually have gotten sick of the pop tunes (too rich) without their more underplayed fillers and quickly shelved the CD for later days. Interesting to hear live cuts, b-sides and these help recreate the period, flavor, especially if you've never heard some of them. Easier to buy if it were $10-15 cheaper but in the end its worth it."
4,Diverse and rather enchanting,"This is recommended for die hard Police fans and not someone who isn't casually attracted to the jazz-rock sound of this classic 80s british band. the b-sides and rarities, especially on the first 2 cds, along with material from their first albums sound rather poppish and Police's attempts at punk seem futile but are still ""listenworthy"" A Sting or Police fan can almost make out the raw vocals of young Gordon Sumner in some songs and the music on this is a testament that the untapped potential of this band lives on after hearing their greatest hits. A good collection. You wanted to own every Police song ever? this is your chance"
5,"""The Police - revisited""","This is a collection well worth having. Of course, every song/melodie, has been - and is still available on singel(s). But unfortunately(?), the oldest ones, only on vinyl. So, if you're a ""late starter"" in dicovering The Police, this is the ultimate collection! It's sad to see what has gradually been happening to Gordon Matthew Sumner's music lately.. It's become more and more safe. Not like you can hear on these four dics together with Andy Summer and STEWART COPELAND. It has unusual instrumentations, provided by (mostly) the excellent guitarist A.S and the exeptional drumming by S.C. Without those two in the band, (Sting and) the Police wouldn't have become the band they were, and still is. Try out some of Andy's and Stewarts/klark kents stuff to.... Some of it is excellent..."
5,Why the Complaints?,"When this box set was released it Really was Everything the band had released. Other recordings have come since, and you'll have to buy them separately. Sorry, boys and girls, but that's life in the big world. You get all the studio stuff plus some live things and B-sides. What more do you want? I would love to have the version of ""Invisible Sun"" that they use in the video-with the lyrics from ""My Fair Lady"" at the end-but I'm not gonna bemoan my fate. I'll get the DVD with the videos on it. They have a song from an Impossible-to-find (cheaply, anyway) vinyl release that their label put out titled ""Propaganda"" (""Landlord""). So, enjoy what you get, buy the things that aren't on it in some other form (if you can find them), and get on with it. This is a GREAT box set at a Very good price. The production of the earlier (pre-Zenyatta Mondatta) material is fantastic, too. Forget the negatives you will read of this collection, and Buy This!"
5,Classic,"Overall a classic band, all together in one set at a great price. Music and lyrics that have truly stood the test of time."
5,the missing link between techno and Black Metal?,"Maybe thats saying too much or I got my genres wrong...but I love this album. Headphone, driving, or lying flat on your back music."
4,Children's Ministry,Purchased the book recently even though it is the 2004 annual sourcebook. We purchased several and the youth worker love them. Excellent resource.
5,Impeccable Boz,"Boz has been a mainstay of pop music culture since the early 70's, and as the century was drawing to a close, he still maintained his own brand of soulful jazz, pop, balladry. This is an exceptional tour de force for Boz. ""Time"" is one of the best songs Boz has ever recorded with its quiet, introspective opening and its rhythmic build-up. What a song! ""Sierra,"" ""Lost It,"" ""Fly Like a Bird,"" and the title track are also outstanding performances. In all, the album is probably Mr. Scaggs' best, along side ""Down Two Then Left"". A definite must for true fans of good enduring music!"
4,"Fine singing, song writing, and guitar playing","Among the latter day releases by Boz Scaggs, ""Some Change"" is one of his better efforts. Although this recording does not have the edginess of his earlier works it also does not delve into the schmaltz that pervades his ""But Beautiful, Standards: Volume 1.""What ""Some Change"" has going for it is Mr. Scaggs' fine singing, song writing, and guitar playing. His voice floats in and above the music, never harsh. This batch of songs reflects life and its changes through the prism of a good wordsmith. Sometimes things may get a tad sappy, but that comes with the terrain. Finally, Mr. Scaggs handles the guitar quite ably throughout this set, sometimes cutting loose like the Boz of old, but always displaying finesse.All in all, things are a bit slicker and smoother than I typically like, but this CD goes well with a solo car trip or a rainy day."
5,"meloncholy and wise, his most beautiful album","This album is Boz Scaggs best, the music is incredibly beautiful and melodic. One of the songs ""Sierra"" shows Boz' amazing vocal range and the lyrics are poetry. This album is pretty complex and requires a bit of solitude to fully enjoy."
4,Boz and his Blues,"Being from Dallas, I always kept an ear out for what New changes Boz may go through. What comes 'round goes 'round. I bought Anthology, and I got to pick out the songs of old. Then I discovered this wonderful album...no fillers. The title says it all, yet sometimes less is more. His passion in his quitar and voice are one. Full circle..."
3,Some Changes,"Only purchased for one song, Fly like a Bird, which I love. Not very fond of this guy but he's ok."
2,honda civic front light,I ordered this light for my 1994 Honda Civic and when I had someone put it on my car it did not fit like the original. The body shop told me that sfter market items do not match the orginal.
5,Zig does it again!,"Zig is an amazing 79 years young. He is an unbelievable inspiration and his God given wisdom will be very helpful in your business,family and personal life. This book will definetely make you ponderwhy you were put on this earth? Are you doing all you are capable of doing with the gifts you have been given? If everybody practiced what Zig preaches, this world would be a better place. He has been a difference maker in my life and many others. Thank you Zig for being a consistent man and a positive role model as a Husband, Father and fellow human being."
3,Over The Top is better,"This is a very good book from Zig..however, it seems to be aimed at readers who are unchurched or don't have a relationship with Christ...neither applies to me. Over The Top is a better book because it seems to be more geared toward diehard Zig zealots like myself because Over The Top is centered on advanced personal growth. Better Than Good is a great book for those who are just getting exposed to Zig, though..a lot like See You At The Top. His stories are always great, no matter how many times I hear them."
3,Religious book,Nowhere on the jacket does this book state that he calls upon the bible and Christianity to reinforce most points made. While Ziglar does have good advice it feels deceptive to me and implies that they knew they'd alienate people by revealing upfront how much religion is woven throughout the book.Simply put if you're not Christian you may not like reading this.
5,Pure inspiration in a book,This has to be one of Zigs best books ever. As a note is does have somewhat of a religious tone but take what you can from it anyway because it is that good. This book will help you with a sense of direction or will help reshape or redefine it. The book is super easy to read and is to the point. Whether you need to read the whole book in a day or just a chapter in the morning this book will help you keep that positive attitude.
2,"I love Zig, but..","It lost me after about 50 pages. Bought another copy for my gf because im such a fan... and it lost her at about 15 pages lol.I honestly think after all the years zig has ran out of fresh things to say!The christian stuff was extremely boring, and biased as well. I knew all about it going in, and secretly hoped if anyone could make me a believer it'd be zig... but it just kind of got in the way. Good for him tho with his faith, and anybody else it helps!Def not my favorite zig work. Actually my least favorite by far. It could be because im 30 and not yet in the phase of life he meant this toward, actually, I'll just give him the benefit of the doubt and chalk it off to that!"
1,"If you like religious proselytizing, you'll love this!","While I did find some of the book's message useful, the author used this platform repeatedly to try to get the reader to accept Jesus Christ as their savior. I found the religious overtones to be off-putting and an impediment to enjoying the remaining content."
3,a bit churchy,"lots of god and bible references (not expected) otherwise good book, very motivational"
1,I couldn't even finish the book.,"I was hoping to read a motivational book; a book on how to get yourself up and going based on your own passion. No, this book tells you that you need God to do anything. Why not teach people how to use themselves and they're actual passion instead of a fear of God to get things going? I wish I could return this book, but unfortunately you cannot return Kindle books."
3,Inspiring Ziglar,"Zig Ziglar is the leader in inspiring folks to do more, be more and live more! Fantastic book. I also recommend ""Running with the Rhinos"" by Christian Warren as companion book. Superb.Running with the Rhinos: Courageous Leadership for a Complex World"
1,"Narration so poor, could not get into the content","I downloaded this from Audible, and it was simply awful! I appreciate Mr. Ziglar's work but this was just really bad. How someone within his company or on his team could not tell him how terrible his reading of this content was is beyond me. I really wanted to get into the content of this book. But the narration was just awful. His speech was slurred, the pace was too fast. I tried slowing it down, which just made the slurs more pronounced. And the way he read it...it was just really bad. His tone. He did not use any kind of inflection, it was very monotone. Very bad. Luckily when I called Audible customer service, they were willing to remove it from my library and give me credit back. Thank you Audible!"
4,Inspirational,"This book is motivational, uplifting and fun to read. Zig discusses many ways of living the ""Better Than Good LIfe"" through his years of experience, and makes it easy. The book is an easy read and does not get too far into the psychological aspects of how the brain interprets X, he just discusses how to achieve a better quality of life."
1,Not Worth Even the Low Price,I bought this recording hoping I could use it in guided imagery/meditation sessions....yet the tempo is far too fast and it is so extrememly repetitive to the point of being frustrating..I cannot listen to it.
4,"Great voices, so-so song choice","I purchased this CD because I love B'way vocalists. They both sound great (and their voices compliment one another). My only problem is that some of the songs are just not that great. I love the Sondheim choices though! Still, a good CD to have in your collection."
5,A Thoroughly Modern Update of Broadway Non-standards,"This album is a fresh look at some old Broadway gems that are not the traditional war horses of lounge singers and talent shows. The singing is pitch perfect and the orchestrations restrained enough to let the voices shine but full enough to give the songs heft. The choice of material represents and eclectic menu of passion, wistfulness and very clever humor. A well thought out album that gets better with repeated listening. The singing is crystal clear and should catapault this highly engaging couple to more renown."
5,"More Marin, Please","Marin Mazzie has a lush, gorgeous voice with a hypnotic depth to it. Although her husband sings beautifully I had not expected that the CD would be a collection of duets and found it jarring to be interrupted from Marin's lovely sound. I wish that she would come out with her own CD and can't understand why that hasn't happened yet."
5,In The Mood,"I am a huge Jason Danieley fan and this hit the spot. He and his wife sing wonderfully together. Also great is, ""I Miss The Music"" on the broadway ""Curtains"" CD."
4,Replacement Battery for Olympus,Ordered this to update an Olympus FE - 190 6 mpix camera. Worked out just fine and had no glitches or delivery snafus.
3,camera charger,"I found that the delivery and equipment where great....However, billing my gift receipiant for the duty was totally uncalled for..How come they would receive a bill for the duty from FedEx 10 days later? How would anyone think that if I was sending a gift to someone that I would want them to pay the duty...Furthermore, I saw no options for cheaper delivery and I think you should get that option in the pay for part...The item in which I bought ended up costing me more then had I gone to the corner store..I will be thinking twice before I go this route again!!Thank You"
3,Jury is still out,"Right after receiving the new charger, the camera developed an (unrelated?) problem and has been sent off for repair.It seemed to work fine."
5,One of the Best Books I have EVER read.,"I am a profession College Coach. I have read many books on so called ""Leaders"" in the sports World. Wooden, Knight, Bryant, Hayes, Lombardi, Coach K, Dean Smith, Patino could all learn something from this book. This book gets to the point and proves the correct and effective technique. I have read maybe 30-40 books on leadership and coaching and I will say that this book is the best book I have ever read. After reading this book I gave a copy of it to all of the Coaches in my Athletic Department, and my Assistant Coaches. I can tell you not one person has not thanked me for getting them this book.If you are a professional business man or woman, a coach, a community leader, teacher, you need this book!"
3,Book is pretty good,The book is ok. The information is straight forward and what you would expect - basic leadership skills. The format is interesting because the author peppers in antecdotes about his Navy Seals experiences. The book is good for someone interested in understanding very basic 'blocking and tackling' leadership skills. More advanced leaders probably won't find this anything but a refresh of things they already know.
2,Did not hold up well,I love the look of this product but it broke pretty easily......only got to use it a couple of times........
5,dvd long overdue,Surely the studio can clean up the print of this extraordinary film! Fans are waiting to buy. Is any one listening?
2,blues - what blues?,"I haven't listened to the whole CD, but I've listened to the Amazon samples. So why do they call themselves the Blues Travelers? They don't sound like blues to me, with the exception of The Mountains Win Again. The rest sounds mostly like 90's pop music to me. I did hear The Mountains Win Again the other night on a juke box in a club in Austin... (Texas... y'all) and though that song was very bluesey. I guess when I think of blues I think of Buddy Guy, some Stevie Ray Vaughan songs, some of Ian Moore's older stuff, Omar and the Howlers, etc. So, to my ears, these guys don't really deserve the name Blues Travellers."
5,Thier best album in my opinion,"""Four"" by Blues Traveler is thier best work IMHO. The interchange between harmonica, guitar, bass and drums is stellar (not to mention the occassional piano and organ work also). My favorite song (if I had to choose) is ""the mountains win again"". Their use of dynamics in this song is tight. Many of the songs are also riff-based, albeit mostly pentatonic (but hey this is rock'n roll), and make me feel like dancing. It's hard to be in a sad mood listening to this cd. 5 STARS!!!"
4,Heavy Metal Harp,"I dig John Popper's mississippi sax speed and control. Also, he presents very unique and interesting vocal inflections. This ain't blues, but it is damn good stuff even if it is closer to pop. Cool party music."
4,"Four, stars","I first found this Cd in my dads car a couple years ago, and ever since it has been my favorite. i love the harmonica. Popper has the most interesting voice, lol. The lyrics have very good vocabulary (yes i know that sounds funny but thats the only way i can think to put it) Run-Around, Hook, Fallible,Price to Pay, Mountains Win Again, Look Around, Stand, Just Wait... they are all great songs."
1,Fat Man's Misery,"Man, this is such a great, talented band. It is hard to make all of your songs sound the same, but blues traveler does it quite well. Only Weird Al's masterful work on the acordian can compare to John Poppers' masterful playing on the most interesting instrument out there: the harmonica. If I was stuck on a deserted Island, and had only one cd to use as a back-scratcher, this would be the one. Shine on you crazy harmonica blower."
4,Captured the era perfectly,"Fans of the old Warren Miller ski films (before he left the enterprise) may remember ""The Mountains Win Again"" playing over the closing credits of one of his better films from the 90s... since that moment, this has captured perfectly for me the particular retro-hippie innocence of the era. I'm partial to the ballads, mainly because BT never really matched their heartfelt vibe and formal studio production in earlier or later work. They freeze a point in time, and if you ever took a road trip or sat on the hill in the car with your date in the early 90's, they probably freeze it for you too."
5,Amazing,I have listened to this cd for years and each time it gets better and better. The songs never get old. Great blues with a little bit of a rock punch to it. It's an amazing album. I highly recommend this cd.
4,Great surprise!,"In spite of the name,this is not a blues cd.This is an authentic rock'n roll cd with great blues influences. The vocals of John Popper,his way to play harmonica,besides the performance of Kinchla's guitar,are rare moments of good mixed sounds,really a great surprise of this N.Y.City group.One of the best surprises of my collection! So,four stars to ""Four""!"
5,A Must Have!,"With a delighful combination of blues, country, and rock, you get the must like band Blues Traveler. If you ever liked ""Dave Mattews Band"" or ""Barenaked Ladies"" , then Blues Traveler is a must have on your list. With awesome songs like ""Run Around"" and ""Hook"" you will not stop to turn back to your old band.""Run Around"" shows human spirit in it's real life terms, and shows people what they see in themselves and other people. ""Hook"" tells us that whenever we leave any bit of ourselves anywhere, ""the Hook"" will bring us back.Blues Traveler is a must have in anyones music collection, and I hope you buy it, trust me, you won't be disappointed"
2,Not worth it,"I am a huge Traveler fan, and I must say this album is their worst. None of the energy of the previous three albums. If you're looking for a B.T. album to start with, pick up one of the first three. I even prefer Straight On Till Morning over this album. Do yourself a favor and buy something else."
4,A Very Good 90's CD,"If I was to name quality bands that started making music in the 1990's, I would most likely have fingers left on at least one hand. Blues Traveler is one of the those bands that makes the grade. Four definitely got them in the public eye and deservedly so. The energy is very high and Johnny Popper's Harmonica playing is excellent and as a rule I don't like harmonicas in music. The sounds like that come out of that Harp are incredible. Although the songs stick to a somewhat repetitive pattern, overall they are fairly catchy especially Hook, Stand, Runaround, Price To Pay, and Look Around. A very worthy purchase indeed."
3,"good album, could be longer.","Over all it's a good album but others are better. Also the cd is alittle short 56 mins long. I think the best song on here is ""The mountains win again"". Also ""Run-Around"" is really a good song too. If you like the group you will like the cd, but not as much energy in this cd as some of their older stuff, but good!!"
3,Highs and Lows,"This album has some of BT's best and worst work. Crash and Burn & Brother John rank in my top five tunes from this amazing band. Quite honestly I can't sit still when I listen to them. I live 7 hours away from ""home"" and when it is midnight and I have been in the car for 6 hours, these tunes really pick me up. However, I can't listen to the whole album, it kind of makes me queesy. Every time I see BT live, they just plain rock. Too many of the songs on this album fall into what BTers like to call BT Lite. If it is lite, it better move me. Plenty of songs on their other albums move me. Other than a few songs, this album fails to do that."
3,Interesting ...,"Interesting reading. I don't suppose this book has much value for an American, but for outsider it helps explain many things, and also offers an insight into American foreign policy goals. The style is very accessible. The mid-east chapter is especially interesting for obvious reasons. Being an Indian, I found his analysis of relationship with India pretty positive and interesting. I could give it 3 1/2 stars if I could."
4,A walk across the globe with henry,"Henry Kissinger, one of the men most responsible for the shape of foregn policy in this country over the last several decades shares his thoughts on the world climate and the U.S. response to it in the present and future. In a thouroughly readable way Kissinger breaks down, region by region, all of the aims and goals, successes and failures of our foreign policy and offers his views on where we should be headed now. The new chapter on the 9-11 attacks provides a needed and helpful postscript. Highly recommended."
4,Interesting book on Foreign Policy!,"Kissinger lays down a great detailed account of US relations with all corners of the globe. Great insight. Lovers of international relations and politics, this book is a must. If you have been under a rock for the last 30 yrs, get this book and enjoy. I know Kissinger is considered a war criminal by the extreme Left, but just try this book. Use critical thinking. Kissinger isn't the law, but he offers some interesting suggestions."
1,Henry The Dissembling Fool,"There is little worse than Henry the Dissembling Fool and his rantings on American foreign policy, particularly given that his expertise is in assassination (Allende et al)and genocide (Timor, Cambodia, Vietnam, etc.)which require little policy, no thought, and no scruples. That's Henry. If he would write about his assignation with Pinochet, that might be of interest, but his lectures on what America should do in the world, a quarter century after he gratefully left formal power, are immensely irrelevant."
1,666: The Beast Is Kissinger?,"Every word in this book, ""Does America Need A Foreign Policy?"" is a lie, meant to beguile you into seeing things in such a distorted way that you approve of the ideas Kissinger is proposing, ideas that he has in the past, and will in the future, go through with whether you like it or not. Henry the Beast? doesn't want you to hate him; he'd rather be your friend, (or at least pretend to be) but if not, he goes both ways, so children, be on your best behaviour, lest Henry- SNAP, went the dragons!An interesting aside...Hey kids, I've got something fun for you today! You can try this experiment at home if you want. The only danger is the implied one. Henry's last name is Kissinger. If we assigned multiples of 6 to every letter of the alphabet, starting with A=6, B=12, C=18, and so on and then add up the total values in the surname Kissinger, we'll get six-hundred and sixty-six right on the money: the mark of the beast. Make of that what you will. Have a nice day!"
5,You Can't Miss,"The autor did a remarkable research and this is, without any doubt, a very rich and detailed biography of Guy Williams. Higly recommended for any Guy Williams fans."
5,What a Guy!,"I truly enjoyed reading Antoinette Lane's book. I learned so much about the real Guy Williams. I felt the book was fair and balanced, never gossipy and very well researched. The author did extensive research and I was amazed at aspects of Guy's life from his being raised in the Bronx to his early career and to his family and later life. He truly was more than the Zorro that I grew up watching on TV. Very well done. I recommend it for any and all fans of Guy Williams."
1,"Good theme, bad soundtrack","Literally every single review listed here gave this CD an abysmal review and said it sincerely sucked (it does), yet each one has 4 stars by it. What's up with that, Amazon web master? I don't think that many reviewers could be that dumb, do you?"
3,"Some poor songs mixed in with the good ones, but still a buy","I'm happy that I bought this album, since some of the songs (like the Goldeneye overture and ""Run, shoot and Jump"" are excellent and a pleasure to listen to. Other tracks are just unfortunate. I appreciate that Eric Serra and the Goldeneye team were willing to push the envelope and try out a new style, and it really pays off for a few of these tracks. Honestly, despite some forgettable songs, it's the only Bond soundtrack that I consider worth buying."
4,"This should be the model for all bond movies, of this era.","Great character interaction, well written, superb casting: this movie is everything that Bond Can be and impressive in it's own right."
5,A Much Different and Innovative James Bond Soundtrack,"If anything positive can be said about Eric Serra's score for this James Bond film it undeniably is innovative and absolutely different from any of the previous scores. The score is pensive and brooding and seems to fit the intention of the mood that the film's director wanted. The disappointment here is that Eric Serra just does not handle the James Bond Theme in a conventional or traditional fashion. Being objective, I think the rest of the score is actually good."
5,An Important Film Score,"What an outstanding score. Erica Serra understood the cinematic James Bond closer than any other composer before or since. James Bond is a loner and a killer carrying out the dirty assignments of his government. He is a tool and an instrument to that end. This dark yet passionate James Bond is finally given a chance to reveal himself for what he is via Brosnan's performance and Serra's dark and brooding score. If Serra had scored Timothy Dalton's last film we truly would have seen the dark side of this character. This is not an action score but a thought provoking exploration into James Bond the man and the world he inhabits. This score is truly is a work of art and seems to have been totally misunderstood. Serra was trying to achieve something that had never been explored. He came ever so close, but measuring success by popularity Serra's score was unfortunately doomed from the beginning."
5,Stays With You,"I first read this years ago, but still remember the world of ""jang""(hedonistic teenagers) that is the focus of this book. The unnamed protagonist's journey to self-reliance is the ultimate rebellion against a society that encourages and rewards mindless pleasure-seeking, vanity and consumerism. The sequel, DRINKING SAPPHIRE WINE, is amusing, but not as good as DON'T BITE THE SUN. A classic in the sci-fi genre, no bookshelf should be without a copy."
1,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed with this book. It basic premise is fine, but it would have been better suited for a magazine article - not a book. It is the same tired old stuff, nothing new. Cannot recommend, even to beginners."
