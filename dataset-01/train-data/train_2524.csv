2,Maybe don't bother.,"I agree with the reviews that consider this book a pretentious, self-indulgent, ego-fest. Wallace is obviously highly intelligent, and every minute of this book seems designed to remind us of that.It all starts off well enough. The characters are quirky and interesting. At first. And Wallace does a good enough job of setting up a curious chain of events to keep the reader reading and wondering what's going to happen. But nothing ever really happens. And at some point I just grew sick of the characters and their weird little lives.Ultimately, this just felt like what happens when a really smart person decides to write something as a way to experiment with and exhibit his own intellect. And while that exercise may have been rewarding for Wallace, it wasn't so terribly rewarding for the reader."
2,Not one to put in your DFW collection,"Definitely not DFW's best. His meandering style, which works well in his shorter articles, is disasterous here. It's a frustrating book to get through. ""A Supposedly Fun Thing I'll Never Do Again"" is infinitely more enjoyable and highly recommended."
3,alternately mindblowing and mediocre,"Ok so I'm not a genius to begin with and probably would not recognise genius if confronted with it BUT the sequence where the main character comes dangerously close to realizing shes a character in a novel during a therapy session is definitely one of the most fun, mindbending things I've read ever and worth the price of admission. The breathless stories within a story were great too and there were a number of wonderful little scenes besides. However. There were also a few too many moments in the book where everything slows down to a boring slog (the plot is appealing in theory but not in execution), and the characters are really only occasionally interesting."
2,really now,"read infinite jest, brief interviews, loved 'em, etc. man, what a first novel.. i really don't understand the positive reviews this book got. while wallace even then had a great ear for dialogue and the funny idea to repeat over and over and over again, this book and its characters and its entire mood are just so profoundly lacking substance, maybe? maybe not substance, but it just seemed very shallow. none of the passages of beauty, none of the brilliant characters found in his later books are present. i wished every character would have died halfway through the book. it is inventive, but its the inventiveness of a beginning author which is sort of depressing to experience when you've (i've) read all his other work first. all of wallace's inventiveness doesn't seem to have any function or to support anything.. and really now, what an awful ending...."
5,The Broom of the System in perfect working order,"David Foster Wallace's The Broom of the System arrived in my mail in pristine condition. The novel itself is a must read for any prospective Wallace readers. His short fiction is superb, but Broom is a wildly successful attempt at a novel and a definite requisite for those aspiring to read Infinite Jest. Thoughtful, hilarious and exceptionally accessible to readers of all levels, I say, ""read this book and order it from Amazon!"""
3,A Wee Work,"The Wittgenstein stuff is interesting, but it's rightly been said that this book too closely resembles Crying of Lot 49 (tho Wallace says he hadn't read CL49, andI believe him). Basically, it's one of those rambling pyrotechnic, mind-in-full-throttle to the happy ending, sci-fi, sorts of things. Worth reading, if you already own it."
4,"Good book, but Kindle version is bad","This is a pretty enjoyable book. I'm a DFW fan, and this isn't my favorite of his, but it's not bad. There's a lot of funny stuff, and interesting stuff, and some pretty goofy stuff. And the ending is characteristically rather unfulfilling, but that's OK.A word of warning, though: don't get the Kindle edition. It's riddled with errors indicative of poor OCR. There are many instances of quotation marks pointing the wrong way, random periods appearing, and missing line breaks. Nearly every occurrence of the letters ""rn"" together are rendered as an m. E.g. ""bom-again Christians,"" ""com"" instead of ""corn,"" and a character named Vem who is probably actually called Vern.Somebody had a computer scan the print version and then never looked at it. It makes for pretty frustrating reading at times.EDIT: Amazon sent me a message that they updated the Kindle version to fix issues. Some of the issues are fixed, but not all of them."
3,Chaos as art,"Though I liked this book, I was rather frustrated by the end of it...I felt almost like I had been cheated. All this excitement builds and builds and it just ends up feeling anti-climatic (and can someone please tell me why it ends mid-sentence?? i thought pages were missing). Honestly, I prefer David Foster Wallace's short stories and essays (10 out of 10 for ""a supposedly fun thing..."" and ""girl with curious hair"") because they give me some sense of cohesion. I felt like in this novel a lot of story lines were abandoned or not developed fully enough. This felt like a bunch of short stories pieced together to form a novel. The writing is good and very funny though...the book had me laughing out loud more than a couple times!"
3,what Wittgenstenian system?,"Okay - this is not a literary implementation of ""Wittgenstein's system"" as I have read elsewhere, although he plays around with some pretty cool Wittgenstenian ideas in it... it is a whole lot like a shorter version of Infinite Jest in ways... I did in fact enjoy reading it, but I understand why DFosterW chose to write Jest in a way that more fully explores this literary stab. And hey - why is it that we human readers so expect our human writers to contrive plausible endings to all that is written anyways? I mean, it is weird enough that our eyes roam across these little symbols on a page and a voice goes and speaks in our head and tells us what is written, that's what's happening here, right, and that's weird, but what I'm really trying to get at is more like"
1,Avoid Twinstar plus,We purchased this set about a year ago thinking that they were Henckels Top-of-the-line set. They were expensive but we appreciate quality and felt they would last a lifetime. The knives are well made and arrived very sharp. After about a month of normal to light use they became very dull. We still felt the knives were worth it and asked the retailer if there was any special technique to sharpen them. We were informed that the knives cannot be sharpened and that if we attempted it we would void the warrenty. The knives are now essentially useless. We very disappointed in this product and feel betrayed by trusting the Henckals name. There is no such thing as a knife that never needs sharpening!!!
1,Coating is bogus,"these knives have some sort of ceramic coating that keeps them from ever needing sharpening... nonsense; the coating means that they cannot be sharpened, yes, but is also wears off with normal use, rendering the knives dull and useless.."
1,Didn't work!,"I purchased this as a gift for my mom's birthday and when she received it, it did not work! She tried working with it and also had my brother work with it. I was embarrased and disappointed for her!"
5,a little jewel of Renaissance music,"If you are looking for an album with all types of renaissance-music from the Low Countries this is the album. Different composers from that time-area and different types of music are recorded. Some songs are very modest, others makes it difficult not to hum with. This cd is a jewel worth listening. Renaissancofiles: this album should be in your collection."
2,FLAT---FLAT---FLAT--,"The characters (and the writing of this story) were as lifeless and flat as the paper they were printed on. The only character who made the slightest impression was the heroine's self centered father (Think Eliza Doolittle's father in My Fair Lady--but much worse) and he certainly was not an enjoyable character even when he got what he deserved.The extreme overuse of metaphysical references (yes, I realize the heroine received no love after her mother died and sought some sort of affection from all that poetic ""soul mates on a higher plane"" claptrap...but Enough is Enough), the term ""elf"" for an endearment (I just kept thinking about Will Ferrell in his gold tights...nothing remotely alluring there), and the overkill on dragon references and motifs (heroine had them stitched or painted on everything she owned...probably even her drawers) were also beyond annoying."
2,Boring,"This was my first Amanda Quick book and i found it to be horrible. Emily is a smart female, i'll give her that, but she's so naive and caught up in her love for Simon, who isn't all that he's cracked up to be, and she just drives me crazy! She keeps going on and on about this higher spiritual love and i just feel like cracking some skulls. Despite how i thought this book would turn out and how it did, i'm willing to give Quick another chance, i hear some of her other books r great. This book however u won't ever catch me rereading. But if u want to try it go ahead don't let me stop u."
3,dissapointed,"Today I read ""Scandal"" a book written by my favorite author. As always I prepare myself for a good read, after all this is Amanda Quick Im talking about. Not too far into the book I decided this wasnt one of her best and once I concluded it I also concluded that I was dissapointed. Normally I would rave about her work, and had I not been truly let down I would have put on a happy face along with a good review, but that is not the case. I will nevertheless continue to read her books, and I will continue to enjoy her writting as well."
1,TERRIBLE ! !,"I'll make this short: the heroine is a total NINNY, and the so-called hero is a total JERK. I forced myself to keep reading, thinking that surely at the end they would improve. They didn't. At the end, he's still an insensitive jerk and she's still totally clueless. The plot ends with the hero KIDNAPPING his own father-in-law, while the heroine looks on placidly. Yech! There's NOTHING likeable in this book - skip it."
4,This story flows like butter!,"Despite the fact that Emily Farringdon, this book's heroine, annoyed me off and on throughout, I just couldn't stop reading.At first Emily seems overly naive to the point of stupidity, but throughout the book we begin to see that she is not as naive as she seems...rather, she is more, optimistic, and determined to be so. I think Amanda Quick tries to make this clear, but in the beginning the message is lost.I liked that the plot began to complicate itself in the middle...although there was one subplot involving a certain manuscript that I would have liked to have been more developed. Also, the first ""sex"" scene comes pretty early on and is sufficiently steamy, but then it goes downhill from there.Overall, though, this was a wonderful and fun book to read, and I recommend it for anyone looking for something quick and light."
3,If you can get through the first 50 pages,"Well, I must admit that I couldn't stand the naive romanticism of Emily initially. And I found it hard to imagine how Simon was attracted to her (which it appeared to be so), even though he meant to marry her for revenge. Anyway, as the story progressed, it was getting more interesting. Simon ended up not as mean as one would expect from someone seeking revenge but Emily's naivety bordered between boldness and stupidity. Nevertheless, I do find myself enjoying the read, minus some of the literary lines. It's always sweet to see Simon falling in love with Emily through his behaviour."
1,When was something going to happen??,"I have loved the audio books written by Amanda Quick. I decided to listen to ""Scandal"" and after listening to the first few disks, I wondered who the heck she found to write the book! It certainly had none of the story intrigue, no fascinating characters, no heightened excitement...not even any kind of a climactic ending that Amanda Quick books usually have. Nothing happened to any of the characters! Even the ""climactic ending"" was short and stupid. I agree with another reviewer who said the heroine was an idiot who stood there and took all the crap her husband was throwing at her. Then when someone tried to blackmail her by ruining her husband's reputation, she comes up with murder as a solution??? I still believe in Amanda Quick books, but pass this one up."
3,The hero doesn't deserve the title,"The heroine and hero begin as pen pals and meet face-to-face at a literary society (two of my favorite things!), but that's of course just so the ""hero"" can gain vengeance and destroy her whole family because her father ruined his father. (Two of my favorite things, cruelly misused!) I understand vindictiveness, really, I do, but I prefer to direct mine to a single individual and not involve innocents. Of course, his plans don't quite go as he wants them to once our intrepid heroine gets involved. I didn't like him and I frequently wanted to shake her, but it was diverting enough for the light, quick read I wanted. Definitely not a keeper though."
3,Need to Smack Emily!,"This is my first review. I'm halfway through the book and I want to throw it across the room. I am SO VERY SICK of reading Emily blather on and on and ON about the ""metaphysical union,"" and being ""cast adrift on love's transcendent golden shores."" I realize it's a romance novel, but if the moral of the story is that reading too much about love and romance makes women stupid, I now get it. Amanda Quick is a skillful enough writer. I've read about five of her novels, but this one really makes me want to puke. I've never read a romance novel where I actually HATED the heroine. She's a complete twit and I wouldn't blame Simon for smacking her upside the head. She's incapable of an intelligent conversation. She's 24 for crying out loud, but she waxes poetic like a twelve year old. DO NOT READ, or else the character of Emily will make you a stupider person. I feel better now, somewhat........"
2,"Interesting, but heroine annoying.","This is the 5th book of Amanda Quick's that I have read and would not recommend it to a first time reader. The character Emily spouts about metaphysical love until Blade (and the reader) is ready to throttle her. The imagery of dragons is very nice and Blade is an interesting character, but all in all, I was disappointed."
4,I really enjoyed this book !,"While this work may not be my favorite Amanda Quick novel (With This Ring and I Thee Wed are my two favorites), I still found it to be an enjoyeable read. It was a page turner and very hard to put down !However I must admit, I couldn't stand poor Emily's family and if I had been her, I would have written them off LONG ago ! Her patience with them did border on indulgence and enabling.That said, I still would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys historical fiction. While it's not Quick's best, it's still a pleasure to read and enjoy."
1,Useless,"a toothbrush would work better, when you attach the brush to the washer there is almost no water pressure."
3,What 3rd Edition?!,"This book is largely obsolete, because it was originally written while the so-called Assault Weapons Ban was in effect, and it doesn't take into account everything that's happened since the AWD sunsetted. Instead of actually revising the text, there are addenda for the 2nd and 3rd editions.This is handy to have around as a printed reference, but anybody looking for an introduction to the AR-15 would be better off getting the U.S. Army manaul (which this book largely reproduces) and reading up at [...]."
2,Its..ok..i guess,Honestly you could do better by visiting websites like ar15.com or researching on your own..honestly it was outdated and not truly helpful..you could research better things.
3,"Informative, but probably of limited interest","This is quite a fascinating look at the way people's opinions of Chaucer - and the ways in which they express them - have changed over six centuries. It's only 300 pages long, so it's far from comprehensive (my edition ends in 1968, which also limits it somewhat), but what's there is very appropriate and indexed quite well.Naturally, it won't be of interest to people who aren't interested in (Chaucer or the history of literary theory) to begin with, but I do recommend it to those who are."
4,A Little Contrived...,"...but entertaining, none-the-less.It is always fun to track down anything David Byrne has worked on, but this soundtrack is a wee disappointing. While listening to the soundtrack (as opposed to watching the movie which it underscores) you always have a sense that this is somehow a synthetic interpretation of what you expect when you look at the forbidden city...almost westernized.It's great music, and a great and cohesive effort, but many of the repetitive melodies sound as if they might be more at home in Broadway hit than a period piece about the declining days of Chinese aristocracy.If you saw the movie and enjoyed the music (as I did) there is no reason not to pick this disc up. If you are buying this because you think you are getting some authentic Chinese music...keep shopping."
5,Great!,"I used this little gadget to mount my computer screen to the wall and it instantaneously changed my world. Thanks to this sturdy device, and a subscription to NetFlix, I can now comfortably use my computer as a television."
4,very together cover album of the elements,"Al Mckay is badd and still got it musically. his trademark guitar licks and the way he hits a Groove and note you always know his signature on a song. for me Earth,Wind and Fire was never the same once he left. this collection takes you back to the days of the Fire. Al and his band knock out the classic Elements jams. this would have been a strong 5,but the cut offs hurt it. but still this is a must have for any fan of the ELements.the instrumentation and pacing here is on point and has that trademark feel good quality of EWF."
2,Not OEM,"This may be a fine set of wiper blades, but they are not OEM. The original wipers for my 2001 BMW have an air foil, these did not. Also, they arrived without any of the mounting hardware inside, so sent them back."
5,Works great!,"Just received this pair of Bosch replacement wipers. Works great on my 528i. It was a piece of cake to replace. Took less than 2 minutes. I'm more than satisfied with these wipers. I'll update after I've used these for a while and if I encounter any problems, but for now, they work great and I'll give these 5 stars.My only complaint would be the price of these but what else is new for BMW owners. :("
2,wrong blades,"I ordered these wiper replacements based on what this web site said I should order for my 3 series BMW. They are actually for a 5 series, not a 3 series, and I didn't try to install them until too late to return them. The web site now suggests a different replacement. Can't comment on item quality, but beware the accuracy of the blade selection process. I checked the reviews of several blade sizes -- quite a few people ended up with the wrong blades when they followed Amazon's selection process."
5,excellent product,This is an excellent product. Very easy and simple instalation. Done in 2 minutes. Wipes super clean and leaves no trailing water marks
4,Great product at a great price!,It was a great product and a perfect fit. You can't beat the price. Product was delivered very quickly too.
5,Great Wipers!,"These wipers are priced competitively, easy to install and work very well. Amazon made it simple to find wipers that would work on my BMW."
2,right part - poor packaging,These are hard to find locally unless you pay a premium at the dealer so the price was right and it was the correct part. The packaging however was awful. The original manufactures box was place inside a larger box with no packing material so the box broke open and the items bounced around the larger box. I had to use a screw driver to straighten the metal clasps so the wiper blades would attach. Packed properly and this would have been a 5star review.
3,Do not be misled,"Do not be misled from the other reviews , the Jubei from this movie has nothing to do with jubei kibagami from ninja scroll.""reborn from hell"" focuses on Jubei Yagyu. they are completly different characters. Also, there is an anime based on the ""Reborn from Hell"" series, which I advise to all to not waste your time. The animation is horrible and the voice acting is not much better."
4,funny stuff,it's a hilarious movie. you have to have the right mindset when you watch this movie. it's a cross between a ninja movie and an unconventional porno.
4,Must have in your library,I love this series of cake decorating books a must have for all levels of cake decorators the illustrations are easy to follow and it covers a wide range of techniques.
5,Helpful,I bought both vol 1 and vol 2 of this book. Vol 2 is more in tune with what I wanted as I am trying to learn cold porcelain. BUT it does have some useful information. Also has a few patterns I believe I can use.
3,"Good book, but sligtly dissapointed",I purchased this book online because of the front cover. I was hoping there would be instructions to the picture on the front. Unfortunatley there were none. Other than that the book has lots of ideas and helpful tips.
2,Very disappointed,"I thought this would be something akin to the roasted hazelnut pastes I'd bought before from chef supply companies. Nope. Supposedly this is made with roasted hazelnuts, but it doesn't taste like it. It really tastes more like it was made from raw hazelnuts. Also, it is very thick; the consistency is almost like that of toothpaste. Much of the oil has been drained from it, I think. To make it more paste-like you will need to add your own oil to it.Very expensive and very disappointing. I ended up throwing mine away.Its only redeeming quality is that it was rather smooth and not grainy/chunky much like another hazelnut butter I had bought online."
1,Buyer Beware!!,"If you have ever been to Crater lake then you know its beauty, its serenity, its vistas, etc. Well, this DVD release is worse than your worst photos, even worse than your old camcorder. Panorama International should be ashamed of themselves for releasing what looks to be an ancient, 5th generation VHS tape version of one of this country's most magnificent geographical sites. They even have the nerve to use the term ""Special Edition"" on their back jacket! Folks, this is a lame attempt to market terrible, blurry beyond belief, unacceptable footage as something new. Save your money, I wish I had done so! Can you say greedy ripoff?"
5,Classic Graham,"The back cover says: ""Women in uniform weren't Cristos Stephanides' thing-until he saw Betsy, in her chauffeur's outfit at the wheel of his hired limousine....He was determined to seduce her, and his enemies thoughtfully provided the opportunity by holding him captive on a Mediterranean island, along with Betsy. While they waited to be rescued, Cristos pursued his passion plan with increased enthusiasm... despite Betsy pointing out to him that she could well become pregnant with his child."" This is part of a Harlequin Greek Tycoons miniseries and is a classic Graham story. I liked the part where Betsy waits up for Cristos to get home from his long workdays with an indoor picnic. I've read almost all of Graham's stories and even though this wasn't my top favorite it was nice and if you're an avid Graham reader you'll definately want to get this."
3,Not the best of her books,I really enjoy this author but this book just wasn't up to scratch. The characters were fairly likable and I suppose the storyline was a bit different but on the whole this book wasn't wonderful.
3,the routine plot,I am a great fan of Lynne Graham but this is just like her other recent books where the hero is a Latin billionaire/millionaire who gets the girl next door pregnant and they have to marry. Although this author is talented her plot lines are getting boring. Please Ms. Graham this plot was entertaining in the first few books but do think of a new story befitting your talent.
1,Pregnant Pause on Reality Without the Passion,"The mere title sums up the book; when I flipped through the pages, it did not develop the plot, nor the characters. Unlike other Grahams' novels, this particular one tries very hard to develop a romantic tension between the couple three quarters way through the book. Incidentally, this conflict is a classic case of misconmmunication on both their parts. If one has one hour to waste, then I will gladly recommend this book to you, and leave it up to your imagination to create the passion that this story sadly lack, even with an image of an indoor picnic scene."
1,esthetic dentistry: a clinical approach to techniquues and materials,i cannot view it please show me what to do
1,Have bandages ready!,"I bought this at a kitchen store and it's dangerous! The device that SUPPOSED to hold the irons on is completely ineffective. Instead of screwing on tightly it simply pinching against the inside of the mold. After ""locking"" it with the cheap plastic knob I went to work. The moment it got into the oil it started slipping! After cooking a couple of rosettes the mold kept slipping off and splashing hot oil on me. I used the correct pan, I read all the instructions, and I confirmed my rosette maker wasn't broken. It simply doesn't work without burning you. NOT SAFE AT ALL!!!!!! The cookies were good though."
1,Disappointed,"I'm swedish and was very excited to try this set, as I loooooove Rosettes, but was disappointed in the construction of the product. During the cooking period of putting the iron in the oil, the iron slipped from the prong on numerous occasions. I was splattered with hot oil and ended up only being able to come away with a dozen cookies. Not sure why they designed this product the way they did. I think they need to do something besides a simple screw to hold the prong into place. Oh well, will keep searching for a set!"
1,VERY poor design!,"Several reviewers have already said this but its a VERY poor design on the handle. Its not only dangerous but its totally ineffective. Half the time your rosette head will end up in the bottom of the hot oil. And since the heads are designed to ONLY work with this handle, you will end up throwing the whole thing out (if you are smart). Don't waste your money on the Nordic Ware brand. Get one that screws on."
2,Technically not stable,The irons do not stay on the handle firmly. The handle portion of the iron needs to be developed so that it holds the irons tighter. The irons fall off during the cooking process. It is poorly designed.
1,0 Stars-UNSAFE!!!,"This product is TERRIBLE! My actual rating is 0, but Amazon won't let customers enter 0. I was so excited to receive this for Christmas and attempted to make a batch of rosettes tonight...ATTEMPTED is the key word here. As another reviewer stated, the tension knob is made of cheap plastic. I began with the star, and followed the scarce directions to attach the star to the rod. Once the tension knob was ""secure"" I noticed it seemed a bit loose no matter how much I adjusted it...that should have been a good enough tip off. Nope, I plunged ahead, happy with thoughts of rosettes dancing in my head...happy until the molds kept slipping off the rod. After a few splashes of searing hot oil, and burn treatments later, I scrapped the batch. I will be attempting to contact the company to see if my product is defective or if recall needs to be issued."
1,Tension does not stay set,"The irons heat up well. But the handle is completely none functional. It will hold the iron for two or three cookies and then slip off as I'm trying to get the cookie off. It's completely unnecessary to have this weak of a connection to just allow for changing molds during the process, as I can easily unscrew a mold from my Mom's 50's set with a pot holder."
2,Bummer Gift,"This was a Christmas gift for my mother-in-law last year. She only got around to using it this Christmas. However, she had several issues with the handle and is not happy with it. She made the rosettes, which were good (she used the accompanying batter recipe), but said if she does it again, she'll use the cup/bowl shape and make a shell for mousse or something. I'm looking for a different handle for her because part of the issue was that it fell apart."
5,works perfectly!!!!!!,"I purchased the Nordic Ware Swedish Rosette Timbale Set before Christmas. It was my first time using this product. I remember my Aunt making these delicate cookies years ago. I had no problem using ""two"" molds at the same time. Simply spread prongs slightly and screw on the molds. I used a ""fry daddy"" which worked perfectly for me. Simply follow the recipe/directions included and there should be no problem!"
4,Hints and tips for using this product,"Although it has two prongs to do two shapes at the same time, I had problems with the cookies sticking together so I would recommend only using one mold at a time."
4,Wonderful,This is a wonderful product. It helps create new memories with my grands as well as provide great fun for the entire family.
1,Stay away,"Got this pan for its multi-purpose utility. And for me( living in an apartment ) space constraints are many. However, this pan leaks even with the thickest of thick batters. Guess, I should ve heeded the reviews which had mentioned the Leak issue....! For me, its $18.00 down the drain."
1,Paper thin pan,"It baked okay. I don't plan to use it a second time. I used the flat springform for a cheesecake and hand washed it, it's looks crinkled now. It's a waste of money. The metal is paper thin. The company's products seem to be a hit or miss. This one is a miss. After seeing such poor quality, I think I'll avoid Nordic Ware from now on."
4,Too small,"It is totally my fault. I guess I should have seen what a 9"" pan is. I really wanted a larger pan, but I must say that when I have used this one it is wonderful. The cake came out of it well and cleanup is great."
4,spring form pan,"finally we got it after ordering twice and waiting almost two months. We about gave up on this pan and also found it another place, exact same pan cheaper"
2,Battery failed quickly - don't expect help from seller,"I purchased this battery (along with others later) from Brilliant Store and it was initally great. After about 6 weeks of use, however, the battery failed and the seller was completely unresponsive. The failures were intermittent, with the battery sometimes failing suddenly and completely, despite the charge showing above 50%. Attempts to contact the seller got nowhere. This has now happened to multiple batteries on different laptops, so I know it's not a problem with the laptop. Steer clear of this seller for laptop batteries."
3,solar lantern,"I am happy with the solar lantern, but disappointed with the brightness of the light. It is not as bright as they advertize."
4,Great translation,I read an old translation years ago. It was hard to understand. This translation is much clearer. I'm glad I got it.
5,Good Intro to Anthroposophy.,"I am currently reading this in a Waldorf Teacher training class. I am finding it easier to read then some of his other books like ""Theosophy"". If your interested in learning more about Anthroposophy I highly recommend this book."
3,General overview,"General overview of ideas of Rudolf Steiner. His first book written, and first attempt to record his ideas, make it a vague book.As Rudolf Steiner became more accustomed to spiritual research his explantions became more clear and defined.This book, however, is somewhat vague, not very detailed and therefore hard to get a fix on what Rudolf Steiner had perceived.I recommend other books by Steiner:1) Egyptian Myths and Mysteries ISBN 08801019892) Spiritual Hierarchies and the physical world ISBN 0880104406"
3,GOOD SHOW BUT TOO MANY INTERVIEWS,"I'VE ALWAYS LIKED DOYLE'S PLAYING AND WAS EXCITED TO SEE THIS SHOW, HOWEVER THE VIDEO PRODUCERS DECIDED TO SPLICE INTERVIEWS INTO THE SHOW AND THAT WAS A MAJOR DISTRACTION FOR ME. THAT MEANS THAT EVERY TIME YOU WATCH THE SHOW, THERE ARE THE INTERVIEWS. THEY COULD HAVE DONE IT AS A BONUS AT THE END. THAT SAID, THE CONCERT IS VERY GOOD OVERALL.I ONLY GAVE IT 3 STARS FOR THAT REASON."
5,Phenomenal,"Years later, I still listen once in a week his Welcome album. I love Jellycream too. I truly understand why giants like Roger Waters and Eric Clapton wanted him. Great songs, great guitar, great vocals, new style in blues-rock. Listen to ""I Wanna Be"": its solo is so groovy. And ""Smokestack"" knocked me out by its raw intensity. What a feeling ! I hope he will seriously make HIS way in the future...PS. JJ Johnson on drums is just perfect. As always."
2,A Taste of a Bad Book,"I figure I could at least save other readers by making the same mistake in thinking this was an interracial romance book. I mean in a sense it was, but it had mainly to do with racial discrimination in the work place. I did find the story interesting but it was not what I thought it would be. I thought like all interracial books it would be boy meets girl, girl tries to reject boy, boy tries desperately to convince girl, girl comes around and they live happily ever after, which by the way I am getting tired of as well. But for the most part I did like the main character, Anise. She was smart and determined and I loved her strong willed nature. But I did feel misled when reading the book and the ending was not very good. It was as if the author decided to end the discrimination victoriously and forgot about the romance."
4,A Taste of Reality,I enjoy the way Kimberly Lawson Roby writes. Her stories almost make you feel you are reading something real. I enjoy all her books.
2,Kimberla Lawson Roby,Not as good as some of her other books but I do like this author. A slow read about the life of three friends from college.
3,An Okay novel,"This is the second book of the author's I read. I first read Here and Now and I must say A Taste of Reality is better. I really did not like Here and Now I found the story a bit unrealistic and depressing however, I would not let that stop me from reading another one of her novels. Although, I think A Taste of Reality is better I do not qualify the book as great. It is an average book, good read, but once you put it down you'll forget the story.I have a few issues with the book; the lack of character development, the unrealistic characters, and lastly the authors depressing story. I know every story cannot have a Happily Ever After...but man, Ms. Lawson-Roby can you give the reader some hope.Once again another depressing tale, I didn't put the book down, but be weary."
2,Disappointing........,"I have read all of Ms. Roby's books. I have enjoyed her stories and characters....... up until this book.This book felt like a whiney story about discrimination. It went on and on. Nothing new was happening. Repetitive statements and rehashing the same complaint to every other character. Discrimination at work, from her husband, at the gym, at the scene of a traffic accident, etc. Enough!!! Get on with the story. I was bored with this book. Definitely not one of her better ones."
3,"Funny, but what about a sequel?","Sure you've made your point, there are totally bogus men out there. Funny, insightful at times, but TBM contains some personalities that don't make sense. What does the cigarette smoker, Mr. Biker, or Capt Gun-Ho have to do with relationships? I've seen/heard the author on local California TV and Radio promoting his book, but the real message here is to promote men bashing. Should there be a sequel for T. B. Women? Maybe. As for now, to women out there...enjoy!"
5,Spider-Man REBORN,"As most others who have reviewed this book, I am a big fan of Spider-Man and had mixed thoughts when I heard about the relaunch of an entire series. I am relieved to say that these writers really know what they're doing and add a depth to the series that was missed in the original. The book somewhat reflects the movie. The only villain encountered besides Doc Ock, is ""The Green Goblin"", though he is not actually referred to as this. The second book is good as well, if not better than this one. It introduces the Kingpin and Electro. Pick it up now if you haven't all ready."
3,"Slightly Overrated, but entertaining.","I bought the hardcover because of all the hype. It's sat on my shelf for a long time while I read things of higher priority. I'm coming off of Warren Ellis's Planetary series (first volume, which is excellent. Not much can compare to that fine work, but this is an entertaining read nonetheless.I must admit that I have only read half of the work. However, I can that the art is solid but not spectacular. The dialouge is believable and at times cute. Bendis works well with tweaking existing characters without making them irrelevant in the Marvel Universe. It's not worth the price for the hardcover, but Spider-man fans out there may have a different opinion."
5,DA fan Must-Have!,"If you are a fan of Daniel Amos and don't have this album, you are missing out! This is a full-length concert full of great music & humor. The sound is superb and this is a 2 disc set full of great stuff...it's a no-brainer!"
4,Works as well as one could expect for the price...,"Works great for the price. I haven't had any fogging issues, and I'm using it with the Sunpro sender. The only bad thing I could say is the illumination is a little dim, but pretty much as good as you would expect for a gauge in this price range."
3,Okay but would not work with my 1999 chevy suburban,"Okay first this would not read right on my 1999 Chevrolet Suburban so do not buy as a straight replacement for that as it may need there float unit which won't be any good on your car. But saying that I bought it to test my system as my fuel gauge needle shakes like crazy I mean its almost a blur it does it so fast so I wanted to find otu if it was the gauge or my sender and this was a cheap way of doing it. Hence to say it worked for that and I now know its the sender unit. Shame though as I cannot use it as a replacement as it would not actually read the fuel properly though, it was waaaaaay out."
3,Deceiving photo,I bought this kit going by what the photo showed as what was included. The photo is deceiving as there are probably more like 70 or so items in the photo. In reality there are less sprinkler heads than what is depicted and the 50 count goes toward the plugs and attachment clips etc. That was a little disappointing. An inventory should be available for viewing to prevent this sort of misconception. I am keeping the kit because I know the stuff is good and it gives me a sampling of things to work with for future needs and you still can't beat the price. (Although the photo and the actual inventory verge on false advertising.) Buyer beware as usuall. gjOrbit 67500 50-Piece Micro Sprinkler Assortment Kit
3,You get what you pay for!,If you are looking at this product GO TO HOME DEPOT! They have a better selectionand it was surprisingly cheaper!
3,neat little set,"I think this kit is pretty neat, with all the little sprinklers. They are several different types and I like experimenting with them. My complaint about this kit is the quality of the fittings is terrible. Everyone I used broke. Bottom line is you don't have to have this kit for drip systems but it does.give you some different sparayers and ideas. For the price I would still buy it."
3,GOOD ASSORTMENT FOR BACKUP,"This is a great little kit of asssorted pieces to have on hand for the occasional repair.The price is certainly right and Amazon service is, as always, spot on.I awarded only three stars because the kit contents was a bit light on the kind of pieces I wanted and a little long on the kind of pieces I will rarely, if ever use. But, still a good buy for very little $$."
3,Clunky compared to later P5,"I had an odd introduction to Pizzicato Five, my first album of theirs being the 2001 import ""In The Mix,"" a Yoshinori Sunahara live mix album.""In The Mix"" is fantastic. The tracks, ranging from a snappily remixed version of ""Baby Portable Rock"" to a beautiful, live, acoustic version of ""The Night is Still Young,"" are excellent as they are varied.In comparison, ""Made in USA"" feels a lot less sophisticated and mature. The tracks generally lack the sort of captivating arrangements and lush, beautiful instrumentation that characterize P5's later work, and feel fairly dull and repetitive."
4,A Great Introduction to Pizzicato Five,"""Made in USA"" was the first P5 album I ever heard, and I couldn't decide whether it was American, French, or Italian. To learn that a Japanese group could move so smoothly from styles that I'd always associated with European and American music of the Sixties and early Seventies. But P5 hasn't only mastered these genres. They've remade them in the band's own image. Fans of the group, used to its sometimes unusual, often eclectic, style may not think this P5's best album, but it may be the best place to start."
4,Fun international flavors,"There used to be a indie music video show in Los Angeles that only lasted about two years. It is where I first saw the video for ""Twiggy Twiggy"" and, of course, had the natural reaction of ""What the hell is this?"" Well, to this day the Twiggy song remains my favourite P5 song, and Made in USA (a compilation of their pre-1995 hits) is just full of happy sophisticated pop songs like it. If you want great pop songs that makes you feel cooler just for listening to it, check out Saint Etienne. if you want the same giddfy effect but in a language you can't understand (which actually boosts P5's esoteric appeal), then definitely checkout this album."
5,The Best Album of 1994,"Not to mention one of the greatest CDs of all time! Pizzicato 5 is in top form here and this is their best collection of music. Everyone loves Twiggy, but to me the real standout is Magic Carpet Ride! Such a great mixture of music, magic and imagination! Go Go Dancer is another fabulous addition. I've purchased roughly 3 copies over the past few years since I wear them out so much!"
1,Not Quite For Modern Recruiters,"While much of this material would have been great for the late 80s and very early 90s, with todays phone butlers and very savvy gatekeepers, this book is absolutely no help. The strategies are simply out of date. Buying this book is a waste of money and reading it is a waste of time. I've noted one endorsement on Amazon from another author of books for recruiters. He must be a close friend of Radin and is probably looking for a reciprocal endorsement. Radin does have some great books out there - this isn't one of them."
4,Nostalgic and reminds me of Grandma!,The iron works great. It's a tedious process but well worth it. Everyone was so impressed with the krumkake cookies at Christmas and it made me think of my grandma.
1,Items was damaged,"I was very disappointed to find the iron broken. So I have no idea if it worked well. Now I have the expense of sending it back, plus I won't be able to use it for my holiday parties."
1,Piece of Junk,"Take it from a Norwegian, avoid this product at all costs if you are seeking a real krumkake iron. It is not a solid cast iron device. Look elsewhere for quality."
1,This unit is worthless,"I bought this unit a few years back. Worthless at best! I wish someone - even the mfg could come up with some kind of solution to retain the heat with these units. I called their customer service - who said, ""Good Luck"" as their best solution. The problem is - Aluminum cools off too fast. It will NOT retain heat. I wish I could locate a Cast Iron Krumkake! Do they make them anymore? eBay - HELP!!!"
1,Cheap,I bought one and used it two times. The ball hinge at the top of the unit broke off. Very cheaply made especially compared to the old cast iron Jotul irons.
5,Perfect for animal lovers,"My son and daughter-in-law live on 2 acres of land, own 4 cats and 2 dogs and love farm animals (especially cows and sheep). This is their first baby and we purchased this crib bedding set for them - fell in love with it as soon as we saw it. Colors are vivid and animals everywhere! As the baby's room is all white now with white furniture as well, this will bring color and texture into the room and they can build on it not only with what other products match it, but just about anything will go with all the color and animals. Great set!"
3,Love the theme......hate the discrepancy......,"I needed to design a nursery that was unisex. This was perfect! I love all the little details! However, I am disappointed in the discrepancy of the inventory of the accessories. I contacted Kidsline to get a list of all the Barnyard products, which they happily provided. I have been to four Babies R Us stores and I cannot find one store that has more than just the bedding. Yet other Kidsline products have everything displayed (i.e. Locomotion) I have written Babies R Us about this and I am waiting for a reply. Otherwise I love the quality and uniqueness of the Kidsline Barnyard product, which is why I am not giving up on it."
3,Cute But............... It pays to shop around,"When I found out I was pregnant I picked out two nursery themes, Barnyard was my boy theme. We found out we were having a little girl and decided on the name Isabella long story short we started looking for a room fit for a princess. And we found it and the rooms name was Isabella (weird huh?)Anyway to my point it pays to shop around. At Jcpenney I found this bedding for 129.99. Then we were shopping one day at Babies R Us and they want 179.99 for it. I couldn't believe there was such a big price difference. Then I started looking at Jcpenney's baby catalog and found that they carry so much more in the barnyard theme than Babies R Us does.Don't get me wrong I love babies R Us but I also know that when you have a new baby coming alot of the time most families don't have alot to spend on their nurseries. I would say that 98% of my daughter's baby items has come from babies R us. And most of the time Babies R Us even beats walmart in some things."
1,Quality Review Anyone?,"Would anyone please help some of us new moms by rating the quality of this set? softness, washability, shrinkage? Any info would be most helpful. Many blessings to you!"
5,Very Cute and cuddly!!!,"I recieved this bedding set as a gift - I did register for it - my husband picked it out b/c it is not too girly and we ar having a girl. It is very good for either sex - it has cute whimsical spirals in the blue fleece and yet the animals are not too boyish looking either. I've washed everything and dried on the lowest setting and did not have a problem. The only thing for me is that the bumper should tie to the bed, but the crib we have has the front panel that slides up and down - so the bumper pad goes with it if it is tied to the spindles. However - you would have this problem with any bumper pad."
5,Love It!,I had already purchased a crib set when I saw this while out shopping for nursery furniture. I immediately bought it and returned the one I had. The barnyard set is so adorable with the waffle pattern and soft fleece animals. The colors are great. After seeing this I wouldn't have been happy with any other set. I love it.
5,cheaper at alternate website,"I have done TONS of shopping around and found the exact same set (6 pieces and everything) online at www.dreamtimebaby.com for $152.90 (not to mention free shipping). It does pay to shop around (even online). Another benefit, you can still register for the accessories at BRU and get a complete set! Worth the look!"
5,Great bedding,We love this bedding. Great quality and washes very nicely. I also like that it is VERY easy to find coordinating Jersey knit crib sheets. A yellow crib sheet with this set really looks nice & bright. My husband and I could not be happier.
5,Barnyarn Bedding Set,"I think this set is perfect and my son will love it!!! One person commented and gave it a lesser review because she claimed to have found it at Jcpenny for $129. I to saw the set at Jcpenny but, if she read the ad correctly she would have realized that the one at Jcpenny was only a 3 piece set while this one is a 7 piece set. That would make the product from Toys R Us one heck of deal!! I highly recomend this set for a baby boy. It's fun and of good quality too!"
4,Price Difference,"I too fell in love with this pattern having seen it first in the JCPenny's catalog. The price difference caught my eye, as Penny's was $129 and BabysRUs was $180. Be very careful looking only at the price, the Penny's set has only the comforter, bumber and sheet while the BabysRUs set has those pieces, plus the valance, diaper stacker and crib ruffle. This 7 piece set would cost $244.95 at Penny's."
4,Liked it.,"I gave this book a 4 star rating because I enjoyed it, but it was light reading, sort of reminded me of the Harlequin romancesI read in High School. I love Elizabeth Lowell, I like her characters."
2,My bad!,I didn't like the book because I was looking for a story set in and at least a little about Ecuador. Perhaps the author has been to the airport in Quito but even that is debatable. Just another sexy conflict story.
2,Mediocore,The book was okay! I just could not get into the characters. Trace seemed to be a rude uncaring man. Ms Lowell just didn't give the character much for the reader to connect with. I guess there is always one out of the so many that are great.
2,"Oh, the great purpleness...","A book of a place where the men are men and the women are ideots... Though, to be fair, the supporting characters did not strike me as helpless twits. The part that really killed this book, however, is the purple prose in the sex and romance scenes. It is difficult to write a sex scene that carries no erotic charge whatsoever, but Ms. Lowell managed somehow."
1,disappointed,Should have read more about this book then I would have noticed it had been published before. It was not up to Elizabeth Lowell standards. I don't mind some romance but I would not have wasted my time and money. I need to quit buying just because of the name of the author
4,Dark Fire by Elizabeth Lowell,"This is a follow-up to Lowell's book ""Fever"" andfeatures some of the same characters as the previousnovel. Recommend that you read ""Fever"" first, butboth are excellent as stand alone novels as well.Description from the book back cover:The Andean Cloud Forest, Ecuador. Mysterious, hauntingly beautiful -- a land like nowhere else on earth. But a dangerous land, despite its beauty. A land to be feared. And respected ... Like Trace Rawlings -- a man who lives by his own rules. Ruthless, domineering, he takes what he wants. But Cynthia Ryan is used to someone trying to manipulate her, especially her powerful father. Surely she can handle this man. After all, he's just there to guide her through the treacherous forest. Thrown together by her father's ruthless ambition, first as adversaries, then as lovers, Trace and Cynthia force their way through the cloud forest -- transformed by a passion as wild and steamy as the forest itself."
1,Disappointed,"When I attempted to get the label off the inside bottom of the pan, part of the non-stick finish came off with it. Was too small and inexpensive item to bother returning."
5,Leaders can be made,"As a lead for a software development team, this book was remarkable in its discussion of what makes a good team, be it a seal team or team creating software. Well written without all the jargon and over analysis found in most leadership books."
2,"Good stories, but very basic business insight","The stories in this book from the days as a Navy Seal are great. But, I bought this for the coorelations the author can make to the business world. From that viewpoint, this book falls short from meaningful business and leadership content. It has the content, don't get me wrong. But the content is very basic. If you've read any leadership book in the past, this book will teach you nothing new."
1,Very little real-world info.,"I did at times like the ""war stories"" written by the authors and being former Navy, I thought I would be able to carry over some of the teachings into the fire service. This books tried to allow a SEAL to share his war stories to a business section of the population. I had very little that can be carried over and wasn't written very well at all. Maybe if the format of the book was done different it might have had an easier time hitting it's point. It was a very hard read too."
5,No better sleep sack!,"This is the only sleep sack I will buy for my kids. It's nice and thick, perfect for the cooler months. It's beautifully made and will last a long time, even after repeated washes."
2,Inadequate Kindle edition of a fascinating book,"""Fragments of Ancient Poetry"" was perhaps the greatest ever literary hoax. MacPherson persuaded the eighteenth century literary establishment that he had found original and ancient Gaelic poems, which he had translated into English. In fact he seems to have written all of the poems in English himself. Nevertheless his work inspired both music (Fingal's Cave refers to one of his later works) and literature (especially Goethe). Some of the story is told in the useful introduction included in this edition.But this Kindle edition of these poems is shabby. There is no table of contents, interactive or otherwise. Worse, the poems are laid out as prose, with no line breaks. This edition came out in 2005. Perhaps the publishers would consider that it is time to reissue it with these inadequacies corrected?"
2,Freshly Harvested!,"At the wonderful Barry Farms facilities, the moment an order comes in they quickly go out and plant whatever grain it is. Then after some time has passed they are able to harvest that grain and take into the factory to be ground into flour where it is finally packaged up and shipped to the customer. And just for that extra spark of good customer service they don't even provide a tracking number, so each customer is pleasantly surprised when their items randomly show up one day....seriously, the product is fine but expect to wait about three weeks or more for delivery."
4,Funny,"This was a pretty comical book. There was some sad stuff in it, and sometimes you wondered how these two were ever going to get together. I understand this is the third in a series, but this is the only one published under the ""Love Inspired"" line so it's the only one I read, but it was easy to follow without knowing the other two stories...Miss Cora was a delight and played a big role in finally getting these two together. She was a hoot!!!It may start our a bit confusing and slow, but the moment Kurt finds April at his house, the book becomes very interesting and you won't want to put it down!"
2,Copywriting (in a) weak,Is this a book or an infomercial at 2:30 on a Saturday afternoon? There are no quick fixes.Learn the craft. Don't look for the quick answer. You (and your work) will be much better off.
1,Boyfriend Nostalgia,"I purchased this DVD on the recommendation of my boyfriend who loved it as a kid. And yes, there are dinosaurs in the gym, but otherwise this movie is slow and pretty much awful. It makes almost no sense and is boring enough I actually slept through the bit with the dinosaurs in the gym."
5,Great fun,The actors in this movie are my age so I can remember when it came out in the 80's.If your looking for safe for the whole family ( rated PG ) science fiction fun with a dash of humor thrown in you must see this gem of a movie.
4,My Science Project,Real good movie... Love the Goat however according to my local speed shop there is no clutch to go on a 6-71 so as to shut it down when not needed.
4,This movie brings out the excitement of my 60's high school,It has been years since I have seen this movie. I still remember with fantasy nastalgia the excitement of high school revisited. Teachers that where far out (Dennis Hopper) and a car jock that was a sorry excuse for a student and a honor student that was a misfit groupie. Their combination gave me a feeling of hope and revenge and excitement all at the same time. This movie is a classic that will be one of my favorites for all time. I have been looking for the tape for many years and have ended up with a worn video store version. I am glad I can finally get a good copy.
3,great customer service,"First off,I have to admit that I absolutely adore this movie. Classic 80's Sci-Fi, it's off the chart with it's medicore side bit actors and all. A must have for the classic rainy day movie collection. I give the movie itself 5 stars.As fort the rest...I ordered this movie from Movie Mars and have been very happy with the customer service. At first I was dismayed because it took about 1.5 weeks for the order to even be shipped, but after it was sent out the movie was at my house within few days. Then I realized that I had ordered the 'wrong region'. Apparently there is some small print on the ordering sheet about buying a PAL or NTCS version that I must have skipped. However once I contacted Movie Mars. the customer service was amazing. They offered quick response times and friendly clear return instructions, as well as a refund. Very happy with this company's customer service, just wish the ordering was a little more clear."
1,Bad product,"This is the first time I have ordered a movie from this company, An never will again! It took almost 3weeks to get to me, An never in that time frame did they give me a expect date. When i finally recieved the movie i put it in to watch it, An nothing, The movie said ""I couldn't play this movie in my region! I was so disappointed."
2,Disappointed,"I bought this DVD for a gift and the recipient was so excited and wanted to start watching immediatly, Upon entering in the DVD player we found it was not formatted for our region. I never before heard of ordering a DVD specific to region.( I guess I am the idiot) Will be interesting to see if Amazon is going to help me with the exchange since we had to open to play."
5,My Science Project,"Was great to find out that My Science Project was on DVD! The price was good, condition of DVD was excellent. It was shipped in a fair amount of Time. Always like dealing on Amazon.com.For the value,price and delivery is why I always come to this website to find what I'm looking for."
3,Science progect homework.,"The plot is a bit thin on substance, science plausibility or character development. However, the movie is very entertaining and humorous. All-in-all it is a very good movie."
3,Weird Explosive and Crazy,"My Science project is a classic 80's thrill ride. This explosive comedy was one of my favorites. A weird glowing orb is placed in the hands of a kid by fate. (He fell in a hole) When power is introduced to the ""machine"" space time and every thing unholy takes over a local high school. See this movie."
4,inner dimensonal time rips-oh my!,"The special effects are great.The character developement is just so-so but i have to admit this movie has its moments of humour and the idea of a flying saucer being disassembled by the government at hanger 54(which by the way is a real location) does not seem that really far fetched.Dennis hopper et.al. do a fine job holding our interests and his ex-hippie type persona(which he also used later in ""flashback""helped hold together what really could only be described as a drive-in saturday night flick you might have taken your best girl to see back in your high school days.If you looking for some simple escapism this would be one you might wish to check out.It has been on moratorium for quite a while and i was suprised to see that Amazon has it-but pleasantly surprised.I ordered myself a copy-can't really justify it -just missed the movie."
4,TRIP PLANNING DVD,"This is NOT the film that plays at the museum! That film is ""Rt. 66 AN AMERICAN ODYSSEY"" by the same film company that made this ""how-to"" plan a trip VHS. This film is included on the ""Odyssey"" DVD version and the DVD is what you should get if you want the most information."
4,Home in Mayberry,"I recently moved to Mount Airy, the fabled Mayberry, and wanted a resource to help me learn a little bit about the ""lore"" behind this community. This was an excellent resource and a fun read at that. For me, it helped bring to life not only the ties of my new hometown to the TV show, but also to learn a little bit of history about this community."
2,Picture and acting quality not up to par,"Despite the recent creation of this Charles Dickens' dramatization, it feels as if it were done decades ago. The acting quality, the cinematography, the picture quality just didn't give the reality one expects now for classic novel dramatizations."
2,Disappointing,"I was looking forward to reading this book based on the many favorable reviews. What a disappointment.I gave up after about 50 pages. The prose is florid and very wordy. I found it tiresome to read. It reminds me of the old saying, ""I asked him what time it was and he told me how to build a watch"".It is too bad as the subject matter could have been very interesting. I read constantly and like all sorts of subject matter. But when I find myself saying, ""Stop, already! Get to the point"", I know it's hopeless to struggle though."
4,This House of Sky: Landscapes of a Western Mind,"The author ""Ivan Doig"" introduces Montana through his youthful eye and shares his rememberances of growing up in Montana. If you have yet to read any of Mr. Doig's excellent books or are already a fan; this book is not to be missed."
4,Great educational tool,I purchased this game for my 6 year old daughter. She has not stopped playing it since it arrived. The game has strengthened her math skills.
5,Great learning game,My 3 year old found this to be a lot of fun and is learning from it. Some of the stuff on it is a little to easy for him but other stuff us perfectly challenging for him. He loves it and so do I :)
4,Tech Toybox Price Gouging,Tech Toybox is selling this for $64.99 on Amazon. What a ripoff. They are taking advantage. Amazon seems to let this price gouging happen but will soon figure out that they're losing customers due to price gouging by their partners. Amazon should list suggested retail price on all items where possible if they care about their customers
5,leapster,"My 5 year old son received this for his birtday and has rarely put it down since. He usually tired of a toy after a couple of days, but he loves his leapster."
4,Nice product - TERRIBLE shipping!,"I love the sandal, the fit is great (street size 5, so ordered size 3). Maybe SLIGHTLY small but I'm pretty sure it'll stretch out nicely with use, a size bigger would have been too big I think.The only criticism I have is that the shipping proved to be much more of a hassle than it should have. I ordered this on the 20th of Nov and only received it on the 17th of Dec! An incorrect recipients name was used, even after supplying the correct info originally as well as TWICE after to customer service. I eventually had to deal with FedEx directly and sort out the problem.."
2,Size was very off.,The sizing table was very off. I had to return the item.I was very dissappointed and had to look elsewhere.
2,These are not wide enough,"It was recommended to purchase the sandasols two sizes smaller, so I went with a size 5 since I wear 7. The slipper fit perfectly length wise, but it was WAY too thin. I can wear regular shoes without needing the ""wide"" version (although the wides are more comfortable), but these are made for people with super thin feet. I couldn't fit into them and there was no way to make adjustments. If your feet are slender, these will work perfectly, otherwise, you may have a hard time squeezing your pinky toe in there ;) Other than that, the actual slippers were great; very sturdy material and stayed snugly in place, I just wish they were about two inches wider."
3,runs 2 sizes small??,"For an item that claims to run 2 sizes too small... these ""shoes"" sure are awfully big! I have very narrow feet, and so knowing in advance that an item ""runs small"" usually means ordering my actual size ""just might actually fit,"" but in this case, sadly, not so. I will still keep them and dance in them - it's still better than being barefoot, for my purposes - but I must say I am a bit disappointed that they don't fit better."
1,discouraging price for wonderful material,"How disappointing that this is priced so far out of the reach of more than 99% of potential customers. I implore the creator of this CD to drop the price to perhaps a 30th of the current insane price. You would likely boost sales by hundreds of thousands (certainly, far more than 30 times as many sales) and thereby reap vastly more profit while doing a great favor for science, society, education, and future generations. At the unrealistically high $700 price tag I expect that even large libraries would balk at buying it.For years I looked forward to reading (and re-reading) the Amateur Scientist column in each month of Scientific American.The awful waste of restricting this to only a small number of very privileged people makes me weep."
3,Okay,"My son really likes the cartoon pictured on the towel, but practically speaking, the towel is too small for a toddler."
3,a tough read!!,"As an Australian and huge fan of Aussie hip hop, I was really excited by the release of this book. Its an indepth look at the Sydney hip hop culture in the late 80's- early 90's. But its not an easy read. Its an academic book, written for university culture studies students, rather than a fan. An interesting book, but you'll need a dictionary to read it. Good Luck"
5,Broadway book review,This is a very handy reference book. Lots of great entries. A must for the Broadway buff. . . .
2,disappointed,"What a great title! I was looking forward to some in-depth information to share with a group of women I work with, in need of parenting tips and specific direct solid suggestions. Instead this was a mere 15 minutes (plus or minus)that left us waiting for the ""rest of the story."" This video contained some good information however stopped short of being useful."
3,Delicious Recipes,"Tried the beef and barley soup the first day this recipe book arrived in the mail. It was delicious, just what I'd been looking for. I hadn't used my pressure cooker in years, had lost the direction and recipe book that came with it, and was delighted to see that The New Pressure Cooker Cookbook had time schedules for the various foods that would be processed in the cooker. Only one criticism -- it would be nice if the book were spiral- bound so that it would be easier to read while on the counter and assembling the various ingredients! I used an old flat-iron to hold it down in order to read it."
3,Caro Baker cook book nut,This cook book was OK it just needed more recipes that had easier to use. JUst was'nt the right Pressure Cooker Cook Book for me.
1,strange,I bought this book and am sending it back. The recipes were a little strange for my taste. I wanted more everyday type dishes.
2,"Disappointing, not for families or budget watchers","I purchased this book after reading the reviews on Amazon. All those 5 star reviews convinced me! They were wrong. I find more help in the owners manual I received with my new electric pressure cooker! Too many speciality ingredients that I don't even know where to buy, much less whether we like or not. Too many ingredients in general. I was looking for down home, easy, family-type meals, and found ""gourmet"" type recipes. I now check out the customer reviews rather than the ""experts"" and I read the reviews more carefully and watch for key words like simple, few ingredients, family, ingredients I find on my shelves, etc. I also check out table of contents when offered."
4,Excellent background on the rise of American Mafia.,"This book should be regarded as a ""textbook"" of the rise of the American Mafia. Ms. Sterling has done an exhaustive research of the origins of the American Mafia from its roots in Sicily to its role in present day. The most memorable discovery in the book was the control the Sicilian Mafia had over its American ""version"". All in all, an extremely informative study of organized crime on an international scale."
1,Havent got it yet,I orederd the 9th of Dec. and still have not recived this order was suppoust to be an X-mass preasant.
5,Music is Powerful especially when used in this way...,"Karen Drucker produces the most positive music, the best quality music, and music that will change your life if you internalize it. Her CD's cover all aspects of our life and how we should look at things. Karen...""I Am Grateful!"" (One of her songs). I think she is a genius!"
4,Decent Gauge with a little extras,This is a decent tire gauge and fits nicely in the Ford Manual case. It has a plastic head. The gauge is a tension spring type. I have found it to be fairly accurate when compared to other gauges I have. The valve caps are plastic but have held up well. They have o-rings inside so they help hold the air in. Not bad for the money.
2,This book is to hard to follow,This book jumps around to much. The information should be brought together in a smoother flow on how to program.
4,really beautiful,"Great cd. Ryuichi Sakamoto is an amazing composer. The music towards the end of the cd that is not done by Sakamoto is of no interest to me, but the majority of it is classical and it makes the cd worth having."
4,my class liked it,"i try to read aloud to my students each day, so we started the minnie and moo series... my class enjoyed this story... it was funny and took them on a little adventure. good form predicting, etc. with young children"
5,A Classic,"This book is often recommended for people adopting older children. However, it is a beautifully written book, and easy to read. It has information on how to help children with all sorts of changes, permanent (like a death), and temporary, like a parent going overseas for the military. The book helps adults understand what is going on for the child, and how to help them better with their sadness, anager and aggression."
5,The best i found,"This hitch is the best i found for the value. The triple hitch is the best t have ""just in case."""
4,Muffin Pan,I like this pan. It makes the really big muffins like in the coffee shop. It's very easy to clean. I might try some other dishes such as stuff baked breads with it also.
4,splendid,"Just love this pan, it's the right size for a recipe of pound cake for instance and it comes out so easily out of the pan. Most of it, after frosting it, it looks so beautiful. My friends can't believe I actually baked the cake."
2,"Good concept, poor execution","The idea behind this product is good, but the actual product is less than ideal. The appearance is cheap and the configuration of pieces that I had to use with my particular car made it look homemade. If your cup holders are shallow (an inch deep or so) and of a certain diameter you must use the base with an adapter cup that makes the setup look silly. This configuration also sticks up too far. If you have a manual shift car with cup holders near the gear shift, be warned that you may find yourself hitting your iPod with the gearshift/your hand. Also the color is a dishwater grey -- not exactly appealing. Overall, a disappointment in looks and performance."
4,Pretty good,"I like it, it works pretty well, and the different cup sizes ensure that it'll work with different cupholder models. So far, it fits in both my car and my wife's, so that's great."
2,Not thrilled,I installed this product in my H3 hummer and the fit is not good. The hole in the factory trim is larger than the face of this adapter leaving a gap around the face and the trim piece. It looks especially cheap in my opinion. It would look fine if you planned to buy the chrome billet trim piece that would cover the gap though.
3,"Good Product, Bad Service",This unit worked as advertised in my 2008 Hummer H3. Although I cant say that for the vendor who sold it to me. Shipping took 6 weeks!
4,A great book for beginners,"I bought this book as I was starting into the hobby of Orchids. The book is extremely informative on the basics and attempts to discuss common problems people have with Orchids. The most interesting sections are those on potting mediums and the individual orchid varieties commonly found at florists or even the grocery store.biggest problem with the book is that it seems to convey the idea that any of the solutions will work which is not the case. Successful orchid growing requires an understanding through trial and error of what will work in your home. There are some basic tenants for everyone; however, they get lost in the details.All in all, it's a great reference book and I would strongly recommend it."
4,very practical information,"This book has alot of practical information and has much more detailed culture information about many different orchid families, also has information about small orchid families that I have not found in any other book about orchids.This book also gives step by step instructions on how to repot or divide several different types of orchids including paphiopediliums and Phrags."
1,Understanding Orchids,"A good, general reference for the advanced beginner. The inclusion of the writer's personal experiences with growing are encouraging and appreciated. Excellent photography."
5,Wonderful book for a newbie to Orchids,This book explains it all. From lighting to the different kind of Orchid. I recommend it highly to someone looking into starting their own Orchid collection or even those with years of experience with these wonderful plants. Has terrific colored illustrations as well.
3,Needs a little more OMMPH!,"I have been a long time fan of the Oriental Adventures line so when TSR announced a 3rd Edition version of OA I got really excited. But when I finally received a copy, I couldn't help but feel disappointed with the latest update. Don't get me wrong I like the book but they could have made it a whole lot better if they didn't focus so much on the Rokugan setting and added some more Chinese, Korean and Southeast Asian references. The martial arts system was a real letdown. I rather use the Dragonfist fighting system (you can get Dragonfist for free at tsr.com) rather than feat selection. All in all it is a good addition but not an excellent one."
4,Well done and filled with interesting details,"Of course, it would help if you were knowledgeable about the L5R thing. I am not so some of this detial is allot to remember! But it is worthwhile. Next time your regualr group is getting defeated by the bad guys, don't kill or capture...Do what I did, send them to Rokugan! Great fun was had by all as the group struggled to find their way home."
2,What was I thinking!!,"I think the only reason I got this book was to see if it would be close to the 2nd Edition game. It isn't. I have been thoroughly dissappointed in the book. It has a few bright spots, but not enough for me to recommended it. If this was based off of the Legends of the Five Rings series, why was another Oriental Adventures book put out for LoFR. If you want to play an oriental character, make one yourself, don't waste the time buying this book."
1,"Good, but is it worth the money?",i thought this book was extremely excellent but it just didnt make the full five stars i hated the stupid races and the world setting was stupid!
3,Nostalgia and Misremembered Memories,"As I buy more of these source books, either campaign settings or class books, I'm finding myself kind of missing the 1st and 2nd edition books.While this 3e version isn't bad, it isn't as memorable as the 1st edition was. Maybe I missed the heading, but I'm still not sure if a Samurai has to pay an extra feat slot just to be able to use their Katana (an exotic bastard sword, per rules) one handed.Some of the prestige classes are cool, but some of the old classes are now relegated to prestige classes, which makes them more of a hassle to attain than before.I'm pretty sure the maps they use in the book for the minor lords house and temple are straight xeroxes from the 1st edition.All in all, somewhat useful, definately better value on Amazon than paying full price at some gamestore though."
3,Not What I Was Expecting,"This book is kind of neat. Unfortunately, I was never able to see the first edition Oriental Adventures, but if this is what it was like, I didn't miss out on much. First of all, I hate the fact that it is based on the Legend of the 5 Rings setting. I utterly despise that. I thought it was only going to be an appendix, but mostly the entire book describes this setting. A lot of the new martial art feats are merely reprints of the exact feats in Sword and Fist. The religious aspect and martial arts entries are very vague. I love running my monk and was hoping for information to expand my character, but there is very little for that. The good from the book are the oriental monsters at the end and a very few prestige classes. I hope they plan to remedy this book in some way by making it in Kara-Tur. Till then, I'll stay in Forgotten Realms...which is a must have by the way."
4,I liked it but it could be better,"I think oriental adventures is a great addition to a D&D library. The only problem I had with it was that the book never realy tould you what was chines, japanize, or Idian. That makes it hard to make any advanture that doesn't take place in their stupid setting."
5,This Book Rules,"Awww yeah, now that's what I'm talking bout. Oriental Adventures rules... one of the better books ever made. Now you can be a ninja and/or a Samurai, and when you're being one of these classes as a player character, you can say things like ""You dishonor me...!"" before you roll your D20 sided dice for your attack.But, perhaps if AD&D wanted to be more politically correct, they might consider changing the name of the book from the slightly insulting 'Oriental Adventures' to the much more PC 'Asian Adventures'. LOL. Buy this one."
4,VINYL RECORD!!!!!,"***Please be warned: This is a vinyl record from the 1970's!!! This is the wonderful albumn we all remember from our childhoods, but for some reason, the corporate big-wigs never saw fit to transpose it onto compact disc!!! If you don't have an old stereo turntable or at least a phonograph, you won't be able to play it!"
3,It's worth the money,"Inexpensive and functional. Could use better water/sweat-proofing to protect the CrackBerry. Could also use an indention to better fit the earphones. Otherwise, you get a functional product for very little money."
5,Excellent Griddle Pan,This is an excellent pan. But please remember that you should not washthese types of pans in the dishwasher! The non stick surface will crack and the bottomof the pan will turn white.Kitchen Aid has the best cookware in my opinion.
2,Didn't hold up,I bought this back on March '07 and and a year and half later it's pretty much worthless. The non-stick doesn't and the surface has cracks. I never used high heat or anything other than silicon turners with this griddle.A big disappointment given it's a KitchenAid.
2,Good stories but...,"As this is a children's book, I was quite surprised and disappointed that it contains no illustrations whatsoever. The type is also very uninspired. These stories can be found in books that are much more collectable and fun to look at as well as read. As a collector of fairy tales, Märchen, and other stories, I was not very impressed."
5,A must have tool for teaching reading and writing,This is an excellent video for teaching phonic sounds and for teaching writing. This video will talk directly to the children and will hold their interest. Children quickly learn to write the alphabet and the basics of phonics for a good foundation for reading.
2,Much better quality is out there,"Skip these and buy Sound it out Land or Leap Frog phonics videos instead. The Learn to Read with Phonics videos look like they were filmed with a camcorder and are simply a teacher writing on a dry erase board while explaining the rules of phonics. They throw in a character ""Snoothy"" in a lame nod to fun and entertainment. But all they thought of for Snoothy to do is make squeeks in the background while the teacher is giving the phonics lesson. Very cheesy,unimaginative and boring. My 4 year old lost interest in 5 minutes."
5,Complete and easy to follow,"My company had bought one copy of several books on JavaScript and everyone started borrowing Beginning JavaScript. So we bought several more! It is complete, easy to follow - for both beginning programmers and experienced programmers new to JavaScript. We were particularly interested in generating XML files. The 'advanced' book we bought didn't cover it, but Beginning JavaScript did. We couldn't be happier with it!"
1,Worst movie I've ever seen,"Wow I thought this was going to be a horror movie when I picked it out. The only thing scary in this movie are the ""acting"" the script and the ahem ""plot."" Every ridiculously terrible christian cliche about the evil demons taking the world over is in this movie. I can't believe someone actually sat down and wrote this crap and didn't intend for it to be a joke, because the only entertainment value in this movie is laughing at how horrible it is. This movie makes plan 9 from outer space look like an academy award winner. If you have an hour and a half of your life that you never want back then by all means watch this flaming pile of dog crap. Otherwise avoid it like the plague or better yet if you see a copy of this dvd destroy it so no else will be subjected to this drector's preachy garbage. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD PLEASE DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!"
5,Take A Risk And Toss Your Map,"In a world where cinicism takes hold of an otherwise promising youth culture, this story of two adventurous heroins is a sign of hope. The two travelers set upon an adventure through Europe in a quest to live with what the world around them provides. As they find solice in various squats across Europe they make poignent insights into the world around them as though every facet of ordinary life were as beautiful now as it was when we were younger. The story is beautifully written and anyone who knows that there is more to life than being the girl that "" boys in adventure stories get crushes on,"" will love this novel."
3,"a quick, fun read","a little to idealistic for me. dont get me wrong, im a big fan of change. but they seem to think that all problems can be solved by becoming like themselves in which is highly hilarious because they want this society to fall which they are totally reliant upon. and dont get me wrong again, i am an anarchist, but theres some things in this world that have happened and you can't change that...i guess i am saying that it seems a bit of naive which makes sense they are pretty young and im sure they grew up in some wealthy middle class family and this is all fun and games for them and not that makes them any less of a person but it does make some things not understandable for them. but anyways, im rambling...a great fun read, some good characters and a autobiography that you dont get to read too often."
1,Horrible and costly textbook,"I wish I could give this negative stars. It is beyond terrible. Nothing is fully explained or worked out at all. It does little more than list the topics of linear algebra. Very few practice problems and the ones it does have have almost nothing to do with what the writer was talking about in the chapter. Professors, please stay far away from this horrible and expensive mess of a book, your students will thank you for it."
4,Linear Algebra for Physicists and Engineers,This is a good book for the audience indicated in the title. I don't especially like the book because it isn't very rigorous.
1,The Worst Linear Algebra Text Book,"This book is terribly written and not scientific at all. It gives incomplete example, and the writer probably assume that people who is studying this book can think in the way he does. In this case he doesn't explain the things that is critical in understanding the concept. I'm using this book for my math course this quarter, and in some reason I have to look back into another book written by David Lay which is much better than this one. Also, this book includes a lot of personal emotion stuff like ""I hope"" ""I guess"" which is very inappropriate in a scientific text book. This really makes the book even worse in some aspects. However, if you have to use this book, you are recommended get the David Lay's Linear Algebra book as well for reference, since you cannot understand what this author is talking about after all."
1,Painful to read.,"Too chatty, overly informal. The author is very knowledgeable, but there is no teaching in this book. Rather, Strang has produced a 500-page stream-of-consciousness tirade on linear algebra. I've taken nearly 20 university-level math classes, calculus and above, and no text has frustrated half as much as this one has."
2,Confusing...,"This book is not for beginners. I am taking Linear Algebra as a review in grad school for Electrical Engineering, and even though I've taken linear algebra in the past (approximately 4 years ago), this book is still very confusing. It seems as though Strang would be a good teacher/lecturer, but this book doesn't seem to be edited and/or reviewed enough to make the explanations and examples clear. He jumps around topics and introduces material in a ""isn't that interesting!"" kind of way chapters before he defines those concepts. Some important concepts have numerous pictures, while others only have a sentence embedded into a paragraph. I'm only using this book now for the assigned homework, and trying to force myself through it to make sure I am doing the assigned reading. Other than that, I am using Schaum's Outline of Linear Algebra to fill in the gaps.In a nutshell, only buy this book if it is required for your class."
3,Too Much Crazy...,"Strang tends to get all holier than thou and advocate the de-emphasis of calculus in the academic curiculum and replacing it with Linear Algebra. That's like advocating the replacement the de-emphasis of the Bible and replacing it with a text on the comparitive study of religions. Crazy.Still, Strang is a pretty good teacher and writer. Just can't get over his craziness. Calculus is the foundation for differential equations and differential equations (ordinary, linear time invarian, vector as in Maxwell's, or what have you) are the foundation for science and technology. Linear Algebra can extend such a foundation, but it can't replace it.I can understand Linear Algebra much better than say Partial Differential Equations, but that doesn't mean I think Linear Algebra is more important. It just means that Parital Differential Equations have more to them and should be taught more, not less."
5,Excellent book,"I stumbled across this book a few years ago when I was visiting someone in Pittsburgh. I woke up early, and having nothing else to do, I picked up Prof. Strang's book to read and I could not put it down. I am a mechanical engineer with an aversion towards mathematics - but Prof. Strang's conversation style completely won me over ( I refer to 2nd and 3rd editions of his book). Since then I have purchased three other books authored by him, and I have watched many of his videos on MIT's OCW website, and I have never felt let down.No author can write a book that will be acceptable to every reader, and I find some of the criticism of his books exceedingly harsh. If you do not know how to multiply matrices, then this is not the book you want to start with, but once you know a little linear algebra, his video lectures and this book will give you a completely new perspective."
4,Sort of Confusing At Times But A Good Book,"I was tired of seeing the theoretical based linear algebra books and so I decided to buy one that focused on applications as well. I got a used copy of the 3rd edition. It's really good on applications. I recommend this book highly for applied mathematicians, scientists and engineers. However, I found some of the applications a bit confusing and some of the problems assigned could be challenging. In my opinion, I think this book has about 35% - 40% theory and the rest applications. Buy this book if you really want to see the applications of linear algebra.-Patrick."
4,This makes my banana bread look even better!,"Nordic Ware makes the best looking pans, but this is my favorite pan from Nordic Ware! This pan makes beautiful breads and cakes. Because it has a non-stick coating you might have to adjust your temperature to a higher setting when baking. And even though it is non-stick, I suggest that you spray it with oil before baking because sometimes it does stick! It's also very easy to clean up."
5,Dramatic Presentation,"Why shouldn't you have a good looking cake? This pan is perfect when it comes to baking sturdy, non stick and it has not hot spots. The shape is quite nice, and the design turns out well. Cakes and jello both turn out very well in this pan."
5,Elongated Classic Bundt Pan Design,"The pan is the size of a normal loaf pan but features the classic bundt cake pan design that Nordic Ware made famous. The design dresses up any quick bread or cake recipe. As others have noted, use Bakers Joy (cooking spray with flour). I would also add be sure to let the cake cool upright in the pan for 10 minutes before unmolding. This pan creates an absolutely beautiful cake/bread with no more effort than that to make a plain product."
5,"Very Special, and a Lovely Loaf Pan!","As with all Nordic Ware pans, this pan is well-built,features a lovely design, is beautifully non-stick, and enables a superb presentation of your baked goods.No frosting is ever needed, the cakes are too glorious to frost!I have very many of the Bundt pans, and found this loaf-pan to be equally delightful!NordicWare pnas are expensive, but SO worth the expense!!!!"
3,Not 8 inches,"Just like other reviewer said, this is more like 9 inches, at the top it goes close to 10. I think it is neither the merchant nor Amazon's fault, the original sticker on the pan says 8in."
3,Tart equals tart,The pan was awesome for the economical price!!! I do agree with a previous reviewer about buttering it up well. I have made a tart every week since it arrived. And now I AM A TART.
5,Cheap and Easy,"This little treasure is one of the best buys ever - it's simple to use, cleans up easily, and well worth the small amount you'll pay."
5,Great Pan,"I made a lemon tart almost as soon as the pan arrived, and it turned out beautifully, impressing my dinner guests. So easy to use and makes a gorgeous presentation. I love buying products made in the USA, and Nordic Ware makes consistently good products. The price is right, so what are you waiting for?"
2,good pan if you can get the glue off the bottom,I'm sure this will be a good pan....but the paper instructions come glued to the false bottom with a so far impossible to remove substance. I'm having a dickens of a time getting the bottom clean!! What an odd thing to do. I called the company and they immediately sent a warranty form and asked me to send photographs of the problem. I have a feeling they will make good on this. I will add more after I hear back from them.
4,Delicious and really easy to make,"Royal pudding mix is really cheap and easy to make. Just add milk, mix by hand or with an electric mixer and refrigerate. I use aCuisinart CSB-76BC SmartStick 200-Watt Immersion Hand Blenderand mix for 2 minutes, as directed. The pudding is ready in 5 minutes, according to the box, but I usually let it set overnight in the fridge. The mix is able to absorb a lot more milk than the recommended 2 cups. I like my pudding to be thinner than most people. I usually mix more milk in than 2 cups. You can use whole, skim, or non-fat milk. The finished product is smooth, sweet, and tasty.Highly recommended, with the only caveat being some artificial ingredients (anti-caking agents and stabilizers) and colors in here (Yellow 5, Yellow 6)."
3,same ol maglight,maglights have always been great reliable flashlights well built and priced right but now with all the improvements with LED's maglights will be obsolete if they dont change that portion of there product leds last much longer and are so much brighter not to mention the light produced is a nice ambient white that lights whole rooms with tiny penlights instead of the dull yellow light with a black hole in the middle of it like these bulbs i will not buy another maglight until they use there heads and switch to led's they are far superior in every way.
3,Is Good But Not the best,I buy this for my backpack and works good for the price ! but is not the best! The maglite xl200 is the best for backpacking and good distance and bright!
2,Track is poorly made/poorly designed,"The cars are fun.The track comes apart just from the force of the cars racing around it. The parts don't line up well either, the cars often get hung up on the bridge. It is also frustrating that the cars can't finish a race without being re-shaken 5-6 times. There are two small bumps on the track that activate the start buttons on the bottom of the cars, the bumps seem to have no useful purpose. My guess is that F-P meant to have these bumps indicate to the cars that they are on the racetrack and need to go longer between shakes. Ditch the track, just buy the cars."
5,Whew,"What a beautiful book. She has a tremendous command of the language and a very flowery style. To be honest there were times I was temporarily lost-wondering if she was being literal or figurative. But it always became clear. A story of a truly adventurous spirit who opens her heart up to a lover who is unexpectedly killed, and the trama that engulfs her.Living in a pop culture of monosylabic dumbed-down dialogue, one forgets how beautiful english can be. What a pleasant gaze through a window into another world this book gives us."
2,Spend a bit more to get a better hose!,"Although I can't speak TOO badly of this hose, it is pretty flimsily made. It does not coil very easily and the connectors just don't appear very durable. I would recommend spending a bit more for a better hose. Basically, this is the atypical ""you get what you pay for"" story."
3,Too Expensive By Far For What It Is,"This is a pretty cheap product for the price. However, it tended to kink and coil wrong, and at the end fo the day, I felt more like just picking up my unit and moving it around versus dealing with this extension. Much less useful than I would have anticipated."
4,Powerwasher Extension,"Fit perfectly on my recently purchased power sprayer, and works very well. It has reduced the pressure a little, but it is worth it for the ease at getting around all the equipment that I clean with the sprayer!"
1,Hole within 1 hour of use,I used the hose for no more than an hour and it developed a hole due to vibration of the hose against itself.
1,cheplymade,the power wash hose is made very cheep and kinks when in use .the hose is not made very good not like the origenal the one i have is heavy gauge the new one is not.i will not buy this any more .
5,Better than OEM,"The PowerWasher 80011 Universal hose is nicer than the original hose which came with my Karcher gas-powered pressure washer. The hose has a heavier outer jacket which should be more durable and help to resist kinking. The price makes it an excellent value. Just be sure the hose you're replacing uses 22mm threads, or you may need an adapter."
1,NOt at all universal,I was not satisfied because even though the product is suppose to be universal ..it did not fit my water pressure and I had to buy something else putting this product at my shed to no use.
5,THE BEST OUT THERE,"If you seriously need a great air purifier, and can afford this one, I highly recommend it. My wife is allegic to my cat, I have asthma, and we can't be without this. I don't trust ozone generators, and this is used widely in hospitals. I have had other air cleaners - this is much better, and quiet (use the sleep mode)."
4,Great For A Single Guy,"I'm a single guy recently graduated from college. This is my first real set of cookware, and I am very happy with the purchase. I cook a few times a week, and this set provides everything I need. I hand wash these pans because I want them to get as much mileage as possible.I rated this set four stars because I am very satisfied with the quality for the price. I am reluctant to use metal utensils with this cookware because I already see a few slight scratches. However, I think this is a durable set that will last several years. The handles stay relatively cool in high heat situations, and the overall presentation is great. Recommended if you are looking for an affordable set of cookware for a regular use household."
4,Great cookware for a great price,"This cookware far exceeds my expectations. It is sturdy and attractive but most of all it works well. Heat disbursement is even and holds few surprises in the ways of hot spots (gas cooking source). Many similar sets will sell for higher prices but for the money this is a sure bet. For those that complain about a hot handle use a bar towel or oven mit, few professional pieces have anything but a bare handle."
4,Good set with one exception,"Just got these about 3 weeks ago. They cook very well and I really like the see though lids. The only thing I consider a con is that the food cooked in the pans can collect around the ""rivet"" that was used to secure the handle to the pan. Kind of a pain to keep that area clean. Overall very satisfied with the pans."
4,Great Cookware,I really like this cookware. Use it Daily. Nothing Sticks. Easy Cleanup. Hoping it lasts a long time. Only have had it awhile. Can't give any long term comments.
5,I loved!!!!!!!!!!!,"Im very happy with my purchase.I start cooking without grease.Clean so easy and look great for the price.Just $100.00 12pcs in Amazon.I make a research before buying, is the best price.The quality is like anolon or any other famous brands."
2,Just OK Cookware,"I actually paid a lot more for this set than what it sells for on Amazon. I thought they were going to last me several years, I was wrong. Only after a few months' use I noticed the interior was heavily marked and a few scratches, even though I only use wood and nylon cooking utensils. I even bought a special cleaning product hoping it would ""fix"" some of the scarring, but no use. The outsides also discolored very quickly. Even the stock pot developed ""rings"" on the inside that would not go away. After just a year and a half, they ended up being donated to a thrift shop. Overall, rather disappointed in their performance. I could not recommend these for serious cooks. Ironically, a good friend and fellow cook has the same set in aluminum, and loves them!"
1,Do not buy this cookware,"Cuisinart Chef's Classic Nonstick Hard-Anodized 10-Piece Cookware Set w/ Kuhn Rikon Utensil BundleUsed these pots for 6 months, non-stick coating already coming off. Had T-Fal for over 12 years with no problem. I have to send the bad pots to Cuisinart, and they make a determination if I deserve a replacement. I will send them, but in the meantime I will be shopping for new T-Fal. Don't buy these!"
5,Great set!,I researched different cookware and opted for this set. I absolutely love it. It is heavy and cooks evenly all of my food. The nonstick is much better than my old set and everything comes off easily! I would recommend this to everyone!
1,Lots of money for a not so great product,"I am very dissapointed with this cookware. It must have been designed to hang from a ceiling and never be used. The outside scratches very easily, mine was scratched before the first use. It also claims to be safe for use with metal utensils, well I used a hard plastic, not metal, spatula that left marks all over the bottom of my 10"" skillet. My T-Fal never suffered once from the same spatula. Had I bought this in a local store, it would have gone back."
4,Good but not Great after 5 years,"I've had this set for 5 years now. They are pretty good from a cleanup standpoint, but you must take care to hand wash them and use a soft sponge. I did not make this clear to my roommates and a couple of washes in the dishwasher and the nonstick surface was shot. The knobs that the connect the handle can be tricky to clean. Also, the lids do not have a vent hole which for the casual cook can lead to frequent boil-over incidents if you are not careful. But, if you take care of them (as I did for the first 4 years) and clean right after use, they will last a long time. One star knock for the lids and the handle connections."
5,Great Buy,I was so happy when the cookware arrived. It is better than I imagined. It has a great weight and the handles are just right. They cook evenly and are easy to clean.
1,Worse product I've ever bought,"I bought this set thinking is was going to look nice for a while due to the name brand and the price. Wrong... This pots get scratches from anything that goes near them. After a few months of gentle use, they already have so many scratches on the outside and look awful. Also, the handles get really hot."
5,Very satisfied!,I purchased this set for my mom at Christmas. She loves the set and is very satisfied with the even cooking. She especially likes the deep frying pan - and cleaning is a cinch!The price was great for such a quality set!
4,So far - GREAT,"Have had this for a few weeks now. Arrived in great condition (well packed - I was worried about glass lid breakage in shipment but it was in pristine condition). So far we've used each piece at least a few times and are very happy with the heat distribution, durability and ease of cleaning."
3,OK Cookware Set,"Decent price for what you get. Cooks evenly and super easy to clean if you like cleaning your dishes by hand. A few drawbacks:-cannot put in dishwasher-when using the glass lid, there are no vents for steam to escape so all the condensation/water collects on lid and when you take it off you spill hot water everywhere.-the glass lid handles get to hot so you have to use a potholder."
5,God and Business,"This book will give you a unique perspective of how His Love positively impacts on the ongoing development of man's successful economic, political and social systems in our world. Businessmen will especially find this to be a very uplifting book.Lee Markquart,Eau Claire, Wisconsinautomobile dealer"
3,Harry Knuckles and the Pearl Necklace,"I don't know what to tell you. Maybe it's my admiration of independent low budget films, or maybe it was the weed and alcohol, but I really liked this film. It's good in a bad way and bad in a good way. Let's face it, it's no stellar epic and it doesn't try to be. The dialog is over-dubbed (probably do to poor recording during filming) but that adds to the appeal of Harry Knuckles. You won't get blown away with special effects, the acting will not move you but Harry Knuckles will make you laugh. Either you get the joke of this film or you'll laugh in disbelief. Regardless you will laugh!!!"
5,Sun Quality,"SUN is a legend in tachs. This is a small one, but a nice looking one, white on black. It has a rounded base for mounting on the steering wheel and it didn't fit any of mine, so I need to alter the mount somehow to fit flat under the dash or on top of the dash. But it's nice stuff."
3,Dial is smaller than advertised,"I've had Sun's tachs in 2 previous cars - they were both the largest in size available at the time. I elected to get this smaller one for my new ride because of the dash configuration, and the advertised size of 2-5/8 would have been perfect. When I got this my first reaction was 'that's not almost 3""!! This dial measures 2 inches by my ruler. I was contemplating sending it back but still don't want the full-size unit and getting this out of the package destroyed the package. It's contained in a 'blister card' affair and has to be cut open.I will still use it... I just wish it was the size advertised."
1,The worst book ever written,"Read ""Inside COM"" or ""Essential COM"". There was once a time when you couldn't find a book on the subject. Now you can. Avoid this book."
5,Very useful,"This foundational bible is a good desk reference. Chapter one summarizes the remaining chapters, and is therefore a good starting point for the uninitiated. Once a topic has been perused in chapter one, it can be studied in the specialty chapter."
3,OK boot.,"First, I have to say, I had a pair of heavy soled skechers boot before and wanted to replace them. These looked almost exactly like it but they weren't as heavy soled as I thought. Other than that disappointment, they are a good boot and well constructed. I just got so used to the heaviness and these seemed like slippers compared to it."
1,Crappy workmanship- good looking boot,"I bought my 1st pair and 3 weeks later sole came off. sent them back, lost my shipping money, decided I would try another pair, 5 weeks into them the soles on both boots started separating, I've glued them twice so far, I'll never by another pair of skechers shoes again, contacted skechers via email and never heard back! I have bought at least a dozen pair of various styles skechers, but this is the end for me. $100 boots should be better than walmarts $29 boots"
3,Comfortable Boot,"Very comfortable feels more like a slipper than an actual boot. Could be a good thing depending on your preference. Very light weight. Sizes run large so select a size below your usual. I've had the boots for about a year. Insoles are average in comfort & support, replaced with Gel insoles and they feel much better. Durable leather and synthetic material. The outsole is NOT very durable. Lugs wore down in less than a year and the sole is actually two pieces glued together. I know because after about 9 months they started to come apart on both boots. This was after occasional ""casual"" wear only.Overall great boot, not for daily use and not the most durable boot out there."
4,OK for the Price,"Dont fool yourself, these arent Amazing darts. I gave it 4 stars just because they are decent for the price...if you are looking for high quality darts you might try something else. I just bought these so that when my friends come over for some darts, they didnt have to use my good ones...."
2,Probably would not buy again,"I bought these curtains hoping to keep the light out of my daughter's room. In the summer, she goes to bed before it is dark.The curtains are not lined and do not do a great job of keeping light out of the room. And since they are cotton, it is very diffucult to iron and keep the curtains from being wrinkled if you open the curtains during the day.On a positive note, the yellow is a very nice color and the fabric is a good quality."
3,"Worth it for ""X"".","I am a big fan of the dreampop/shoegazer/psychedelic rock scene, and hearing 'X' for the first time on college radio was my introduction to BailterSpace.If you like My Bloody Valentine, Lush, Ride, Swervedriver, Sugar, CatherineWheel, Sonic Youth, and The Cure, you will enjoy the sonic soundscapesof this little-known band."
3,Makes cute muffins.....if you can get them out of the pan!,"I've baked with several Nordic Ware products but this one has given me the most problems. It's supposed to be non stick, but even when I spray it with a little oil it still sticks! I suggest that you spray it with a lot of oil if you plan to bake with it. Clean up is usually hard on this muffin pan. I suggest that you soak it in hot water and then use a stiff pastry brush to clean it. But overall it makes cute muffins or mini bunt cakes!"
4,Informative read,I wanted to learn more about the Jewish culture after being a part of a Rosh Hashanah service. I wanted something written in simple terminology and something I was familiar with after attending a ceremony.
3,"A good looking, medium quality shoe","These shoes look as nice in person as they do in the pictures, though they are a fair amount darker than in the pictures. They almost look black in dim lighting.The overall quality is average. They scuff easily and the scratches show a brighter brown/orange color. The air in the soles takes some getting used to...not sure if I like it or not. They are very light and the material is very thin - they feel kind of cheap.Also, they seem to run maybe a half-size too small. I normally wear a 9.5 to 10 and ordered a size 10. They are too tight unless I wear the thinnest socks I own.It may seem like I'm knocking these shoes, but that's not the case. Overall they are a nice shoe for the price, but you definitely get what you pay for!"
1,Even Amazon srews up,"Hello! I am a fan of your company, have bought books and recommended you to many friends. I bought a pair of Clarksdales at Dillards for 59.95 was happy with them and, when by chance, I saw the EXACT SAME shoes advertised at your website for 29.99 and decided to buy an extra pair.However, when the shoes arrived I found that they did not fit. Although they are marked as size 12 they are, in fact, size 10 !!!As I could not find any means to contact you (e-mail, fax or telephone) I decided to return the shoes. (Which by now may have been sold again to another disappointed customer who will also return them)I wish that on your website you have a telepnone number or e-mail to contact you. You have NOT lost a customer as I discovered that you are fair with your return policy.John"
4,"Excellent price, looks and wears great.",Got this at a great price and have been happy. They fit too snug at first but seem to just need some breaking in. Very happy with this pair and will order again.
5,Mr.,Great price for excellent product!!! Very comfortable to wear. Highly recommend for big feet people.
5,fabulous fit for wide feet,"These are my husband's favorite shoes. His mother gave him some for our wedding day.. he had those for 10 years or so, then another pair for 7-8 years, but a dog we had (not for long) chewed those up. That was a couple years ago, and my husband has not been happy since he didn't have any Rockports to wear. They are so comfy (apparently). So when i saw these at Amazon i jumped on them. Thankfully i got the right size and he beamed on Christmas morning.!! Great soft soles and slightly wide for wider feet people."
5,What a steal,"These are Rockports!! I paid $29.90!! These are not seconds. They are gorgeous and my husband says they are comfortable. They have rubber soles which was good for him where he works. I don't particularly care for that type of sole, but they are a safety issue for him. AND, since I have bought him Rockports in the past and paid hundreds of dollars for them, he thinks I spent that much this time!! AND I will NEVER tell!!"
5,Great for daily wear,"Excellent cushion and padding give an extremely comfortable and snug fit. Only down-side is, it's made in China, so who knows how long it will last... However, at 40 bucks a pop it's still a bargain."
5,Great Looking Shoe,My daughter bought these shoes for her boyfriend and they arrived looking great. He has seemed very pleased with them.
2,Waterproof leather shoes,"No, your feet cannot stay dry and comfortable in WATERPROOF (non breathing) leather shoes in the summer. When you take your shoes off at day's end, your socks are WET."
2,Poor Quality,"I thought I was getting a bargain - Rockports at a discount! When they arrived, the craftsmanship and finish impressed me. Stitching looked even and the shine was appropriate for dress wear. They are comfortable enough (maybe a little snug), but I though it was odd that they creased across (rather than to the rear of) the cap. Within a few days, however, the skin-like coating (perhaps the waterproof layer?) of the uppers separated from the underlying leather, creating blisters in the creases. Within a few weeks, those blisters tore, exposing the leather underneath. I'm not sure where this will end, but at less than 2 months old, they will soon look too bad for dress wear. And, I suspect that the waterproofing has now been compromised. I'm glad I didn't pay full price!"
1,No exchange,The shoes did not fit and i was unable to exchange for a larger size. Does it make sense to be in the clothing business and not be able to exchange for another size.I would never order another clothing item thru you folks as a result
3,Rockport Shoes,The shoes seem to be bigger than others I have of the same size. The shoes pinch my right foot and are not as comfortable as I have previously experienced with Rockport.
1,Clarksdale Rockport Shoes,I have many Rockport shoes and these are junk. They look cheap and I could not even get my foot into them as the instep is so low.
2,There are better shoes out there,"I purchased these shoes because of the ""Rockport Brand Name"". However, the shoes do not live up to the brand reputation for comfort. Got blisters on my toes the first 2 weeks. After giving them a chance to break-in, I realized they would not get any more comfortable. I dropped them off at a local neighborhood homeless shelter. An expensive gift!"
4,Principles and Practices of Electrical epilation,"As one of the most recent publications on professional epilation, it was up-to-date and well written. There are a number of chapters to do with running a business in Great Britain which are of no value to those operating elsewhere and chapters regarding general first aid and marketing which are not necessary. Otherwise, I found it a very good text, easy to read and comprehend."
5,Dopey,"The Dopey collectable is a well designed, well crafted figurine. It shows this adorable character in it's fullest. Shipping and handling were expedient. I highly recommend this to any collector."
4,Puffs puffs everywhere,I love the pan the only problem is the nonstick coating comes off really easily. DO NOT USE nething other than plastic or chopsticks which are my favorite.
4,"Works great, but ordering was weird...","My husband ordered this version of the Nordic Ware Iron, without noticing that it had an expected ship date of about a month later. We pretty much try for Amazon Prime shipping (which this had). When I went in to see why it hadn't come, I realized it had the long ship date, so I switched the order to a wooden handled version (which said it would ship immediately --and was cheaper). This is what actually came.Go figure."
3,Love the idea - but poor quality,"We bought this product after seeing it at our friend's house. My daughter loves using this product and having fun trying different things inside of the pancakes. However, we have only used it 3 times and the inside is already scratched up. We have not used any harsh abrasives on it. But we had some food stick on the inside and from trying to get it off, the inside got scratched. I have other teflon pans that I have had no trouble with and this one scratched so easily. Since its unsafe to use a teflon pad that is scratched, this will have to go in the garbage. So I'm very disappointed. I suggest paying a little more and getting a good ebelskiver pan."
1,Not worth the money!!!!!,"I used this pan just 1 time,I repeat, just one time and the Teflon finish peeled off from one of the wells. I want to return it but I threw away the package. If you purchase this item, do not destroy your package because you will probably want to return it after a few uses. I am very disappointed in this item and will state it is not worth the money I paid. My sister told me about the Ebelskivers. She bought hers at Williams-Sonoma last spring and has had no problems with the finish. For a few dollars more I could have had a usable product.Norpro Filled Pancake Pan, Aebleskiver Pan"
5,Ebelskiver pan with a nonstick finish! Great idea!,"This pan transforms the flat pancake into a European treat - the aebelskiver, a warm, delicious, filled pancake. The nonstick finish makes the pancakes easy to turn and easy to clean. Any pancake recipe works. Filling the cups about one-third before adding the filling helps to prevent overflow of the batter. This pan is a user-friendly way to enjoy aebelskivers."
3,not cast iron,"This is not your classic heavy cast iron skillet. It's very light weight & not as durable as the classic ebelskiver pans i recall, but works just as well."
1,not worth it,"this pan is hopeless, no matter what I did I could not get these pancakes to come out in one piece. its a non stick surface but the batter sticks to pan all the time. I would say pass and just make regular pancakes. Great concept but maybe the wholes need to be a bit larger..."
4,Satisfactory,"This specific pan is the only one of it's kind that i've found that will work on glass-top ranges. Seeing as that's what i own it was the only option. The non-stick surface is damaged a little too easily, but as long as you use butter every few rounds it works very well. It has a nice weight to it, for aluminum, and the handle seems to be well-attached, though i haven't had it that long. This item makes smaller pancakes than you'd expect though, fully bite-sized.Overall i'm pleased."
3,Daniish Pan,A good pan at a good price. The wooden handle is a nice feature. It makes acceptable breakfast muffins. Use moderate heat and be sure the pan is well greased.
3,Nordic Ebelskiver,"Wish there was a tool along with the pan to remove the pancakes. The product quality is OK.If you are not careful, the non-stick will get scratched very easily."
2,Disappointing workmanship,I have had used the product for less than one month. The area that the batter is poured is already chipping and the handle is loose. I am disappointed about the workmanship of the product.
3,The second half was better than the first.,"I admit it, I'm rather picky when it comes to Mack Bolan books. It seems that far to often, there's more emphasis put on a high body count than a good plot or creative action sequences. As this bok goes, once again, a good idea, falling short of its potential. In the first half of te book, the action all seems to run together once Bolan gets his friend out of jail. Once he returns to the States, things get more interesting, though. I've read better Bolan books, but this one wasn't bad."
1,The Worst Program I have ever seen,"When I bought Orphen the original I decided to get Orphen Revenge so I could have a complete set. This was truly a waste of money, not only is it not worth 35 + dollars it isn't worth 5 cents.They took a wonderful program Orphen with stylish animation, characters you could feel for and root for and when you reached the end you were sorry it ended, then hoping the story would continue you buy Orphen Revenge and there they turned it into cheap animation just to make a buck.There is no story line even the one liner jokes which were great in the orginal were really sad in this one. The animation is 3rd rate. I guess you really can not make a sequal that equals the original one.Do yourself a favor and not waste your money on Orphen Revenge if you do you will be kicking yourself it is not worth one penny."
4,Fun Start to a new Series,"While a little flowery in language the overall story was well done with characters easy to hate - very few to love. For those who play in the Everquest world this is a great addition and will make a great series. Hopefully Bob Salvatore will also write a book or two and bring in some of the other great fantasy writers. Scott Ciencin has done some great work for Wizards of the Coast which I loved but this was just not up to his best work, thus a 4 star."
1,Buyer be ware,"I am a big fantasy fan and I follow pretty much what is written and is on the market but this book is an insult to the name Everquest and R.A Salvatore. After the great written intro by R.A Salvatore I fell asleep 10 pages into the story. The story is hard to follow, battle scenes confusing and misses a continuous story flow. My advice go to a bookstore start reading the actually story (not R.A Salvatore's intro) and then decide for yourself. I for myself will keep it as a reminder that a great name as part of the coversheet does not mean a good story."
1,I cant believe it.,I really cant believe that R.A.Salvatore or Sony would attach their name to this terrible writing. The Battle scenes are extreamly hard to follow or believe. The writing was so expressive that it was incomprehensible at times.I play EverQuest and read fantasy all the time & found myself wishing the book would finish.Purchase at your own risk.
2,The forward was better then the book itself,I've been playing EverQuest for about 3 years now and have just started playing EverQuest II. I picked up this book because it seemed the most logical addition to my addictive collection of EQ paraphernalia. I was wrong. The forward written by R.A. Salvatore was fanominal! As I have come to expect from Bob. The story itself blows though. Sorry guys.
2,Disappointing,"As a longtime player of the EverQuest games, I was really looking forward to this novel. It was difficult to follow and the violence seemed to bother me."
1,Dull,The Rhythm sticks were fun for about 10 minutes. It is the middle of January and they have not been touched since Christmas Day. My children are 8 and 5.
4,Drummin',The rhythm sticks arrived promptly. I wish the sound was a little better and sounded more like a snare drum or a drumming sound.
2,Could have been a great gift but was broken when it arrived.,I purchased this product as gift for my son and he would have loved it had it not been broken when we recieved it. I was able to return it thankfully but did not purchase a new one.
3,Get your earplugs ready!,"I purchased this for my 4-year old great-nephew. I know that any musical instrument can be educational for kids, but I think he is a bit too young. The sticks play only one ""song"" and there is NO volume control which is very loud. It was tough to convince this little guy to play without the song as all the adults got tired of hearing it after 10 minutes. With a little training about beats and timing I think he'll like playing these to songs on the radio. It would be nice if there was a selection of ""songs"" built in the sticks, and especially a volume control. I wanted to select a different kind of sticks but they were unavailable at the time of my purchase."
2,Poor functionality,"We got one set of these and within a few days one quit working correctly. I figured we just had a bad one and the manufacturer quickly sent us a whole new set. Within 10 minutes a stick quit working. What are the odds that we'd get two bad sets?Aside from that...the sticks are noisy and there's no volume button. Tolerable, but we have quieter toys. The music is synthesized, not a big deal, just rather hear loud ""real"" music.Between 4 stick we have 2 functioning sticks. The two that work we like, but the kids only play with them for just a little while at a time and then move on to something else."
2,We found them loud,"While I certainly didn't expect these drum sticks to be whisper-quiet, I found them to be quite loud for little kids' ears. And there was no volume control. Also, I was hoping for a more authentic drum sound that I have found in other toys. I returned them."
4,My kids rock with these,My kids use these durable sticks all over the house and have a ball. I am even thinking of ordering more so each child has their own. The pluses-the ends light up when hit and they work whether the tips or handles are tapped. The drawbacks-no volume control and no music choices.
3,very noisy,I bough this for my 2 yeAR OLD the only thing that would make this better is to have a volume button.
4,Da bird refill feathers,"My cats loved it, so that means i loved it. I was happy with the purchae! I would certainly buy it again."
4,Cats love this thing!,"I have two cats and they go nuts chasing after this toy. It's pretty close to imitating a bird in flight so my kitties love it. This one is to replace the original one that came with the pole which is sort of chewed up after a couple of years of use. Aside from the laser light, this is a favorite toy for my cats."
4,Fun cat toy!,"My 8 month old cat loves this toy. He was afraid of it for the first two days. Maybe because he thought it was a real bird. Now he likes it and leaps high into the air to try to catch it. When he does catch it, it's hard to get him to let it go. He's a bit rough on his toys, but fortunately they sell replacement feathers and other things to dangle from it. I'm not sure how long it will last with my rough boy, but so far I'm really happy with how much he enjoys jumping around with it."
2,refill feather,One of the feathers was broke in half not what I would expect for the price I don't think i would try another.
3,Containers & SOME Hanging Baskets,"The title of the book is misleading: the words should have been transposed to signify that only a few hanging baskets are included in the book. There is a good variety of examples of container gardening, but hanging basket ideas are sparse. With good quality photos and pages, however, it's good book for beginners who are looking for general ideas and some recipes for planting combinations."
1,Quality Product?,As I removed the cardboard insert to wash it for the first time I was surprised to run my fingers and hand through it to notice sharp burs and rough edges. I expected a little better craftsmenship for the price. Hope my cakes slide out...
1,heavyweight 12 cup bundt pan,"that I already ordered but I made mistakes I dont like that kind Bundt Pan I meant orderKaiser Bakeware Kaisercast 6-1/2-Inch Saphir Bundtform Panso l already mailed UPS back with package box and recipt also explained letter into box returnedheavyweight 12 cup bundt pan... so please exchange to that one I wantKaiser Bakeware Kaisercast 6-1/2-Inch Saphir Bundtform Panso please free to call me 866-690-8129 after June 2 we will be out of town today 26th..Thanks,Emie Stringer"
1,Only disasters from this pan,"I am ready to give up on this bundt pan. Thus far, my cakes refuse to come out, no matter how I prepare the pan for baking. This is not a cheap item, and I am very diappointed with it."
5,lightweight,"Lighter than I expected. Turns out cake without shortening and flour prep. The only misstep was when I undercook or add too much liquid. Great easy to use,easy to clean piece of equipment."
2,Too light weight,I returned this item and purchased a Nordic Ware Original Bundt Pan which is heavier in construction weight.
5,Tyler Hilton is an amazing singer!,How Love Should Be is an amazing song! It is one of those catchy songs that you can not get out of your head!!! Tyler Hilton has an amazing voice and is extremely talented! Highly reccomend buying this!!!
4,I love the Rhapsodies,I purchased this CD to help me fill out my collection of classical favorites. It did not disappoint. I am not a musician but the music sounds real good to me.
1,Odd sizing,"I wear a 9.5-10b but 10's often are very roomy! I tried to put these on-size 41, the size recommend for 10-10.5- and I felt like I was in a fairy tale! But I was one of the step sisters. I can't fit my toes into the shoe much less my heel! It's a small but totally cute shoe. Unlike the fairy tale though, these cuties are going back."
3,Weej and Johnnie Hit Florida,"These are comments I have received from those who've read my novel: ""It was so refreshing. The humor was great and the characters were perfect."" Pat Wallace, Simpsonville, SC""The book is wonderful. You should sell it as a movie. The plot is suspenseful, humorous and certainly better than many of the `family' movies in today's market."" Harriette Acorne, Petaluma, CA""Your book is fabulous."" What you have written is ""in the vein of Jan Karon, except funnier, or Carl Hiiason except tamer."" Betsy Goree, editor of Lonzie's Fried Chicken, Lynn, NC"
1,Wish I had never seen it,"I've only recently starting reading this sort of book and was excited to find this book. A mixture of science fiction (which I love) and chic lit, but it was aweful! No one could speak without cursing or being crass, everyone smoked, drank and had free for all sex without any concerns about any of it. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a prude. I don't mind sex or drinking or smoking. Just not ALL THE TIME.It felt as sleezy and ashy as a badly kept hotel room. THe only likable character was the male interest who wasn't in it nearly enough to redeem it. I'm going to have to read something light a fluffy just to wash out my mind.Take my advice and don't touch this book. Move on to someone else and save yourself the need for a cleansing shower."
3,This was okay at best,"The plot was a bit jumpy for my taste. Her boss/crush Clay, I wanted to stab in the eye with a spork repeatedly. It could have been a bit shorter. I actually had to put this book down a couple times before I finally finished it."
2,Entertaining fluff,"I love romance and I love paranormal so I thought this would be the perfect book. It was entertaining enough, but i thought the main character and her life was a bit too shallow. I mean, is it too much to ask the main character be charming with half a thought in her head? I guess so. Overall, check it out of the library but don't buy it."
3,dating can be deadly,"I feel like this book had a good premise, but the writing was too disjointed. Once I became interested in one plot, the author quickly changed directions. It seemed like there were many threads that could have been developed further, such as the main character's relationships with her mom and Lina, as well as her father's death.As for the mystery itself, it was really cliche, and it wasn't too difficult to figure out ""whodunit."" It seemed like paranormal mystery writing 101, and, in the end, I was more interested in the character's lives and personal relationships than the mystery. I did like the main character, and I'd probably read a sequel if only to learn more about her past."
3,Nordic Ware Cooling Rack,"I really like this cooling rack. I was a little disappointed that it was made in Taiwan instead of the USA, like most of their products. But it is well made. But i am trying to buy only USA made products and i wish it would have said in the description that it was imported. I would have kept on looking."
3,"Fine, altho small and no protective feet","A nice product, although small--it isn't big enough to cool a full tray of cookies. Also, no protective feet as listed (no big deal, but the product listing should be changed). I returned mine, to buy the bigger size ..."
4,Where's the Feet?,"When this rack arrived, it was already missing a foot. But that was okay with me, because the first thing I did was remove the two that were still on, and take them and the loose one in the box, and tossed them into the junk drawer.This rack fits perfectly in a cookie sheet, and makes a great draining/cooling rack for my deep fried foods and my roasts. The non-stick grid means all it usually needs is a quick rinse, but it's sturdy enough for a ride in the dishwasher."
2,Not as advertised,"There are two different cooling racks with the same part number. One is gridded with rubber feet and is 10 x 15.25. The other is not gridded, has no rubber feet and is 11.5 x 16.75. I ordered 2 from Amazon wanting the 10 x 15.25, which is the one described, to fit inside 2 pans I already own. I ended up with the larger racks, which I can't use for what I wanted them for. Both are pictured on Nordic Ware's website ([...]) for the part number 43342. I copied the second picture from their website and added it to Amazon...I see this as a Nordic Ware issue, not Amazon, and contacted them on their website."
1,ORIGINAL AND REPLACEMENT WERE BOTH CHIPPED AND FLAKING!,"Flaking teflon is thought to cause cancer.Both grids I received, the original, AND THE REPLACEMENT,had the NONSTICK COATING CHIPPED OFF/FLAKING OFF.Appropriate packaging by Nordic Ware may prevent the problem, but since, I have purchased a (unknowingly at the time) Nordic Ware pan that was ""exclusively"" made for Williams-Sonoma...I ordered 2 from them, and they too, with good packaging, had the nonstick coating chipped off. I now think the problem is with Nordic Ware's ""quality""(haha) control. No more Nordic Ward products for this puppy. WITH THIS MANY PROBLEMS, I WOULD GIVE THIS PRODUCT 0 STARS, BUT THAT'S NOT AN OPTION."
2,Nonstick peeling off,"This is a sturdy cooling rack that fits nicely in a half pan, but the non-stick coating started peeling after a year or two of only occasional use. Disappointing to find the coating coming off onto the food (and worse yet, that we likely had been ingesting it!)."
3,A Good Reminder,"This is a good book, but I didn't find it to contain anything that struck me as new. It's always good to be reminded of spiritual truths in a practical way, which is what I'd say this book did for me."
5,So Beautifuly Written,"I could not put this book down once I started reading it. The book was intriguing and wonderfully written. In between the rich history of Hue and her people, the author masterfully told a love story that was beautiful, mistical and tragic.I hope to find more beautiful novels about Vietnam such as The Daughters of the River Huong. Realistically, I just can't imagine there is another novel better that this one."
4,Fascinating,"Anyone interested in Vietnamese culture will really enjoy this book and the other two in the trilogy, especially Mimi and her Mirror. This is the second book. I have recommended them to several of my friends who love to travel."
2,daughters of the river huong,"I found this book very disappointing. I expected a fairly accurate history of Vietnam with characters who could be credible. I found neither of these, just waffling fantasy & poor continuity."
2,following this story and timeline is very difficult,"Following this story and timeline is very difficult. The auther does more than necessary jumping around of timeline, characters and locations making it very difficult to follow."
3,Mixed Feelings About This Book...,"Uyen is a truly talented writer. She understands Vietnamese culture and history very well. She is able to describe to perfection the spirit of Vietnamese women: strong, dignified, proud. I would have preferred that the book start with the mystique concubine, and not the troubled Simone.Half way through the book, I became strongly disappointed due to Simone. She is self centered and weak. She is an insult to her ancestors' dignity, pride, and courage. She has nothing of the pur and passionate feelings which her ancestors had. She seems to spend her whole life, in Vietnam and out of Vietnam as an outsider. Simone made me cry of shame and bitterness."
3,Not enough history for me.,"I have tried to read through this book for almost two years, and cannot develop an interest in the characters. The history of Vietnam that I sought has been elusive for me."
5,River Travels,A short while after I have read this literary piece I have the sad luxury of standing by the perfume river in the tien mu pagoda. The images in the novel flow through my mind as if I have actually witnessed these women's stories in this very place. How rich an experience. I thank the author.
3,Not sure,"I tried to get into this one, but somehow the spark wasn't there. Never finished it, but I'll try again."
2,I have tried to inform amazon...,This book is NOT in Vietnamese. This is the first book listed in the Vietnamese language section on Amazon. Vietnamese people that want this book in their native language should not buy this. Dont know why it cant be changed?..
1,kattywatty,Did not enjoy this book. Very hard to follow the story. Very weird. Hard to find anything to gripe about because the whole thing stunk.
2,Not For Me,"I love family generational stories told through the woman's perspective but this simply didn't do it for me. I didn't make it pass the second chapter. I did however skim a bit of the middle, and I realized the writing was a little stitled. If your trying to decide to read this or not I'd highly recommand reading the google preview first. Even though Daughter of the River Huong you may like it, so check out the preview and find out"
5,Mesmerizing!,"This story is so beautifully written, as hypnotic as a river current as it traces the spirit of a proud young woman through generations. I couldn't put it down. A great read!"
4,I like it,"Interested ideas. Recommended for readers who love to explore new areas, especially who like to know more of Vietnamese culture."
2,Intreresting... A times,"So I bought this book with high expectations on the referral from a friend. Turns out she hadn't finished it yet.I thought it started well also but became stagnant more than a few times. In order to give credit where it is due I must say the history buff in me found a wealth of information about the history of Vietnam and for that I am immensely grateful, but the story as it is told leaves a bit to be desired in my opinion. I would not recommend this book as an enthralling read."
2,Adolescent,"I was looking for something more descriptive of the land and people of this historically troubled country. ""Daughter"" is not it. The descriptions of both places and people were repetitive and surface-level and much of the story is adolescent in viewpoint, without being balanced by another character's (or the author's) insight. Very disappointing."
5,Nonstick surface works well.,"We initially got this pan in hopes of making our own English muffin egg sandwiches. It works okay for that, but 3 eggs fill up all 7 wells as they're fairly shallow. On the plus side, because the eggs are thin, they cook quickly without turning. So, we just pile 2 or three on a muffin. I suppose they could be turned, but can't figure out how to do that without making a mess. With a little melted butter, the eggs slide right out. There is a pan out there with deeper wells made specifically for eggs, but it's over $100. Haven't tried pancakes in this one yet. For the price, I highly recommend."
3,Moderate,"The pan is quite large for the oven so the heat distribution is not quite balanced, more over there's no room to lift the pancake for flipping so sometimes it tears apart."
2,disappointed,"Based on the instruction,you can only use this in the oven. The bottom is not smooth & flat. The non-stick coating was rough in some parts and scuffed up. HSN has a nice one that I am going to order from."
2,disappointed,"I purchased this one June.I read a lot of good review about it.But mine doesn't work well even though it said non-stick.I don't know why.Everytime I make pancake, I failed."
1,"Not at all a good novel, rather the opposite","This is probably the longest novel I have ever read whic I should not have wasted my time with. But I persisted, today I would not. To say that it is pretentious, tasteless and lacking any dramatic coherence would be just the beginning. The real mystery is why it got a prize - other than its overt literay ambition (which is no good if you cannot fulfil it), or perhaps the author has friends in the right places...There are some excellent modern Catalan novels I can reccommend in order to recover from this one. Three in particular come to mind as a rapid cure: Incerta Glòria by Joan Sales, Paralues d`Opoton el Vell by Avel.lí Artís Gener, and Bearn by Lloren Villalonga."
4,Lots of helpful hints,This book had lots of helpful hints although some people definitely have much too much time on their hands to think this stuff up.
4,Picked it up and didn't put it down for 2 hours!,"The only reason I'm giving it 4 instead of 5 stars is I agree with an earlier reviewer who observed that the ""cutesy"" titles make these tips more difficult to readily identify. I also ordered this 1999 version because I recently purchased a 1998 travel trailer. That's turned out to be a mixed blessing. Some are spot-on, old school, duh!, kind of invaluable tips and some feature dated technology or things that have likely been vastly improved by now.For the ingenious, thrifty, make some bits of your RV life inestimably better, this is a GREAT little book. Happy I purchased it."
2,Not very useful,"I have to say the book didn't meet my expectations. A lot of the ideas are extensive modifications involving expensive tools, cutting the sidewalls open etc. I don't know why it's called a 10 minute book. It's also not helpful in solving a specific problem. An index would be good, the often colorful titles in the toc don't help."
1,Don't bother,This item hardly works. It charged the batteries enough for about 2 minutes of run time at about 1/2 power. Don't waste your money or time
2,I thoguht it would have been better,I got this for my 8 yr old daughter who wants to be a fashion designer. I thought this would have been the perfect gift. She played with it for a short time and hasn't played with it since. She told me it was hard to make the jewels stick and to keep up with the beads.
1,Wrong Edition,The picture of the book clearly indicates that it is the 12th edition. I received the 10th edition and the seller will not take it back even though I wrote to her as soon as I got it. I have to buy a new book that is the correct edition and I have lost the money I paid for this one unless I get a refund from Amazon. I would not buy from this seller again. A couple of other people complained about the same issue with this seller.
5,Love This Cake Pan!!,"I purchased this pan to replace an identical one that I lost in a move. I don't even likeangel food cake. I purchased it to bake pound cakes and coffee cakes. The pan has a nice weight, and is very sturdy. It should last me a long time. My pound cakes baked evenly, and I have no complaints. I had a couple of ""misses"", that had nothing to do with the pan. I left something out of the recipes, and you can't blame a pan for that.The fact that I replaced my lost pan with an identical one, should tell you something."
2,Not the best,"I used this for about 10 times or maybe little more since I bought it several months ago. The coating from the top edge is already peeling. Very disappointing. It is heavy weight and bakes well, but the coating came off just too fast."
2,scratches!!!,"The product scratches after a couple of CAREFUL uses. The Teflon coating is not good at all. It is cheap, however."
1,Peeling Coating,3 gentle uses and the non-stick coating is peeling in huge pieces. Rubbing any area lightly with your fingertip yields a handful of flakes. Avoid!
1,Nordic Ware heavyweight 10 inch pan angel food cake pan,"This pan is a disaster. I tried to bake three cakes, following directions exactly. All stuck to the pan and could only be taken out in chunks. I called Nordic Ware and found the manner of their representative appalling. While she was laughing, she said I should have cut parchment paper to fit the bottom of the pan. That is not mentioned in their directions. That was a joke, indeed, as the paper floats to the top, causes the pan to overflow and costing me yet another hour of time cleaning the oven and wasting more ingredients.Fury would define my mood. Will send in back and make one more attempt to speak to someone respectful at Nordic Ware."
1,Disappointing,I love Nordic ware pans but this one I don't like.This is NOT a thick metal like a typical Nordic ware. There's not even a logo of Nordic ware on this pan!! My chiffon cake didn't turn out well. My search for a good chiffon/angel food cake pan continues.
5,Beautiful,"This flag is great first because it is made here in the USA. Second, because it has sturdy, woven stripes. Third because it is large enough to be proudly displayed on our flag pole."
4,Good historical fiction,"What if the Nazi's had pushed the offensive at Dunkirk and occupied England? What if the free government of Britain were pushed into the far north, and forced to fight via an organized Resistance movement (similar to the actual French Resistance). Personally, I like historical fiction and the idea of a British Resistance combating the Nazi's on the streets of London and sourthern England appealed to me. A little lengthy, with some exhaustive (and occasionally boring) character interplay. A good ""what if"" story, though it would be nice if Steven's would focus a little more on the combat and a little less on the cloak and dagger."
3,Quote Book,"I didn't really like this book. When I read it, I thought of it as a quote book. I mean, it has great quotes from Marines, but I don't really want to read a book on clips of quotes."
2,Marines,"I bought this book to understand more about the U.S. Marines. It was ok. The chapters with the quotes were interesting for awhile, but there were way to many. I did however enjoy reading the chapters on the history of the Marines."
4,Not as Good as the first 2,Forgotten Freshness 1 and 2 are Two of ICP's best cd's. It would be hard to match this.This is still a good CD its just that a lot of the songs on it Ive allread heard so they are not really Forgotten. Its just freshness
2,Wack!,"Wack!! as Madrox would say in his phat or wack episodes. THe only good songs on the whole album are the 3 to 4 songs we have already heard. The other stuff is so pathetically stupid and talentless. Two of the songs, J stole the beat from something he already put together, put gay lyrics to it, and called it a new song. How creative is that? This is the most disappointing thing I have ever heard from ICP and I have been down since 1995.-Tha Chyna Dawl"
5,a great piece of work to keep us entertained until the sixth,"this is a great album, i anyone who says different hasnt really listened to it. i thought i had everything icp has ever done because i am always searching the net for new stuff but this proved me wrong. their is 1 or 2 songs that arnt that great but the rest are masterpieces. the songs that i do have are remastered and now sound much better.if you are down with the clown this is a must buy.you wont regret it.[...]"
2,Mr. Christmas Winter Wonderland -- Cable Cars,"I have other Mr. Christmas animated items, so when I purchased the last two prior to the Christmas holiday for use with my rather extensive Christmas train layout, I was disappointed that the scale of the two products were different than my previous Mr. Christmas items. There was no mention of the scale with reference to the skiers/lodging, etc., which is important to train enthusiast. The products work well, it is only the scale (sizing) that I am totally disappointed."
4,"Classic, but a word of caution","Many of the recipes in this book vary considerably from how the drink of the same name is prepared today. The author often calls for ingredients which can no longer be procured, but that is to be expected. For the serious cocktail enthusiast, this book is a must-have, and this inexpensive reprint means you won't want to kill yourself if you spill grenadine on it.The previous person to review this book makes a good point, too. This is not simply a formula book of recipes, but THAT is exactly what makes it a great read. Another perfect example of this is ""Cocktail Recipes from the Nineteenth Century - The Flowing Bowl"", by Spencer (another recent reprint of a rare old cocktail book.)"
1,"Not 12"" across as described.","I bought this rack expecting it to be 12 inches in diameter, as listed in the product description and on the label. It's actually 13 inches across, which is too big for what I need. (I got it for the bottom of my water canner set, to sit under the rack for jars.) Very annoyed, so back it goes."
1,Not As Advertised,"It claims to be a 12"" diameter, but it is actually 13.5"" in diameter so it is too big and is absolutely useless for my purposes.If it had claimed to hold a 12"" cake or something that would be different, but is says 12"" diameter.It is a problem with the manufacturer, because the 12"" claim is even on the packaging."
4,Furrry and Fun,"I brought these boots before I went to Michigan and I had them sent overnight just so I could wear them on my trip. To be honest when I first got them they arrived at my mom's house and when I took them out of the box I was very very disappointed but my mom LUVED EM!!! I dress really different anyway so it kinda blew my mind that she would LUV EM. She convinced me to keep em and I did...and she also said how cold it is in Michigan and I would need them over there and trust me...I did. I got alot of compliments from people in the airport and that boosted my liking of the boot a WHOLE LOT!!! Now I'm gonna buy them in the winter white. They're warm, very...very comfortable and cute...wide like the other comment said but that's what makes them different from other boots and stylish...I highly recommend them!!!!!!!!!"
5,Sorel Ahnah Snowboot,"Great boot, just need to get used to wearing something so fluffy. Looking forward to trying them in the snow. Very roomy fit, and very comfortable."
1,Not at all what I thought it would be,"Flimsy, doesn't hold air well - air plug sticks out, stars are not visible like in the picture. Save your money."
3,Not as expected,"I was anxious to get this item to replace an old thermal mug. It's very nice looking and holds a lot. My main problem with it is that if you use it for cold beverages, you will get a lot of wet condensation on the outside - very messy. I haven't tried it for hot drinks yet."
5,Most fun,"You can go from stock to a custom BLING car. You make new friends,you can buy stuffthe best car i got was aMitsubishi Lancer Evo 917 in rimsNeon green paintit was awsome"
5,GREAT,I BOUGHT THIS ITEM 2 MONTHS AGO AND I LOVE IT .. I USE IT ALMOST EVERY NIGHT .. I LOVE DOING ROAST AND RIBS IN IT .. IF U ARE LOOKING FOR SOME GOOD COOKING U HAVE TO TRY THE ROTISSERIE .. EVERY THING COMES OUT SO JUICY
3,Can't find accessories,Apparently the Popiel store has gone out of business and it is very hard to find accessories for the rotisserie. Even though it mentions ribs in the description of what can be cooked with the rotisserie you actually need a special cooking accessory for the ribs and for thicker cuts of meats like steaks and chops and vegetables there is a special basket. Ronco will sell them to you at double the price they were at the popiel store. Additionally customer service is not in the US when I called to order the rib basket she quoted a price of $36 and I said but it was$19 online and she said then I suggest you buy it online and hung up on me.
1,utter junk,did not get 1 use out of this product the timer came broken out of the box not worth the money real junk
5,Love it!,"The Ronco Rotisserie is terrific. Moist chicken, turkey, duck or roasts. Set it and forget it! But check the temp with the thermometer. Family loves it and cleanup with a dishwasher is amazing."
4,It's nice,It is a well built machine. But as someone else posted it is a bit noisy. But this is a motor subjected to haet and a LOT of weight....
4,So Far We LOVE IT!,"We purchased this Ronco Rotisserie to replace a smaller Ronco unit that stopped working.The first unit's heating element went and from reading online it was cheaper to buy new then attempt to repair the bad one.The rotisserie works great. It's bigger and has a digital timer, which is much easier than the analog timer on the old unit.Makes VERY yummy pork loins, whole chickens and roasts. We have had some dissapointment with cooking pork chopes in it one time and will stick to other cooking methods for those.Clean up is fairly simple as most parts are dishwasher safe. And you truly can set it and forget it as it takes care of itself while cooking.The top DOES get hot so be careful. Overall very happy with the purchase."
5,Best Item I bought for the kitchen so far,"Received this new item in perfect working order. Instructions/VHS video were simple and clear. Though I imagine it being larger in size( there is a larger model , but Amazon does not carry as of yet?) The only item not included in the box was the vegatable warnming tray ? No big deal.I was able to cook A 6.5 pound rib roast to perfection . shipping from Amazon was fast. A friend of mine bought one and could not stop raving about it! she was right, I highly recommend this product! Thanks Ron P"
2,Cooks great but has a huge issue,"Our friends have this model and they love it. We purchased the same one and our first chicken was SUPERB - the best EVER! Tonight we are having guests and went to cook two of them but they are too heavy for this model and fall off. The problem? This model is supposed to be able to hold a 12lb turkey and/or two chickens. The two chickens are only 8lbs. Af first we thought the chickens weren't balanced properly etc. But after trying several times it is simply the weight. I am so sad to give this only a 2 rating since it does cook great, but if it won't cook even two thirds the weight it says, that is a HUGE issue for me. I will be calling them tomorrow to return. Very unhappy and having to go to Plan B to feed guests. Grrrr..... I'm glad I found out BEFORE Thanksgiving!"
4,Makes a great gift,"Bought this as a Christmas present for my mother...she loves it! Dad says he hasn't eaten this well in years. Mom uses it 2-3 times week to make anything from roast beef or steak to chicken or burgers. Mom really likes the tenderness of the chicken, while Dad raves about how moist and tender the roast beef comes out. Mo's only complaints are (1) the non-stick surface scratched within the first two weeks during the cleaning process and (2) the recommend times error on the side of over-cooking rather than under-cooking (i.e. if the book calls for 15 minutes for medium, 15 minutes results in medium-well results)."
5,Nancy,I just love this new toy of mine. It does everything just like the TV says.I use this Rotisserie & BBQ almost every night of the week. I have almost every accessory that is offered and that helps make things a lot more simple with less mess.
3,Haven't used it enough times.,I will use it a few more times and rate it again. So far I am trying to justify the space it takes and the cost of it.
4,Great rotisserie.,Have used it several times. Quality is good. Makes great chicken and roasts.Saw a lot of bad reviews but have had no problems with it. Highly reccomend.
1,"""not"" like on tv","The so called non stick coating must be cheap black paint, first time you put a basket on the spit you will remove coating from spit.If you follow the recomended time charts you will be eating raw, not rare but raw foods! Two 3.5lb chickens took way over two hours, chart says 1 hour& 20 mins, ""no way""!, unless you enjoy chicken cooked to 135f, personalyI'll pass. have not tried the skewers, doubt if I will. Just put it up in the closet and give it to someone i really don't like!"
5,I have a Rotisserie just like this one only it was one of the first they made,We bought this for our son and I know him and his wife will enjoy it as much as we do.
5,love this rotisserie!,Loved this rotisserie. Have used it for 2 yrs just bought one for our daughter and one for our daughter-in-law.
5,Ronco Showtime Platinum Ediiton,I brought my Ronco a back in November but wasn't home to use it. I put it to the test over the last 2 weeks and I obsolutely love it! I roasted a chicken and a 9 1/2lb turkey and they were both cooked to purfection and tasted GREAT! The only thing I have to remember when using my Ronco is to tie my birds up well before cooking.
5,Meet expectation!,"This is my second rotisserrie..the first one the door broke of course over extensive period of time using it. So we figured since we moved into our new house we want to start new. Getting this rotisserie was an absolute must have for us and I used on a regualar bases. We rotisserie our short ribs, whole chicken and even turkey for Thanksgiving...let me tell you it is the best thing ever..we just set it and (not forget it) but check on it now and then..but the meat come out juciy and tender with so much flavor and you can use your oven for baked pies or green been casserole and yam...so definitely with not doubt about I recommend this to others."
5,Love it!,"Got this as a gift from my hubby. I love it! Cant think of anything I dislike about it. Works well, cooks thoroughly, and quite tasty!"
3,Good product but needed one improvment:,Good product but needed one improvment:There is no temperature control otherwise a nice rotisserie I can recomand to others.Ronco St5000plgen Platinum Rotisserie
1,Ronco Showtime Rotisserie,The food does not get hot enough and takes longer to cook than what is advertised. I was not satisfied and returned it.
5,Excellent Product!,"This is the second time I have bought this item. Lost the first one in the flood of 2006, and after 6 months of getting new place I bought another one. Generally I use it 4 or 5 times a month. Love a half of a boneless pork loinin it, nice crunch and juicy inside! Have deep basket, line with foil -- take 5lbs hamburger,a couple of onions and green peppers and make a meatloaf! Not even Ron thought of this!"
4,Great Unit,This is the second Ronco Platinum Rotisserie we have purchased. We love chicken and pork loins done this way so decided to buy a replacement. The first one died after 4+ years of use. The wires burned off the heating element. Hope this one lasts longer. Otherwise is would be a 5* product.
1,Great while it lasted but only good for 6 month,"The much promised customer support is just not available.I purchased this unit last September by March of 2006 the heating element was burned out. I was told the warranty had expired and they sent me a parts list. The heating element was not on the parts list, so not even a paid repair was offered."
1,Piece of junk!,"The rotisserie does make good chicken, however the product is not made to last. Though I have had one for three years I have used it less than 10 times and it doesnt work anymore. It wont allow me to enter cook time, therefore it wont work at all. Since it only came with a 6 month warranty, the comany would not replace it free. When asked if others have had this problem, they said yes.The coating on the pans comes off very easily also."
1,Ronco Oven,"It did not work, The teeth did not meet with the drive teeth. sometimes it would turn a half of turn thenstop. It was a piece of crap that I just didn't need. It was already sent back. and need it off mycredit card right away."
1,Throw it out and forget it.,"After about 15 uses over the duration of one year the machine quit working due to an electronic melt down. It was very difficult, if not impossible, to clean and squealed like a stuck pig. The chicken was very good but as it should have been when you consider that it cost over one hundred and fifty dollars plus to cook 15 chickens. Before it burns down your house, do as it did and ""Throw it out and forget it"""
3,Missing Parts,"I recently purchased one through Amazon.Com. Model ST500 PLATINUM. I'm missing some much needed parts and not so needed parts. This included the INJECTOR, ELASTIC TIES, SPIT GEAR PLATE and the SPIT ROS RESTING BASE. I will never order again. Very DISAPPOINTED CUSTOMER. I will be contacting AMAZON shortly."
1,Ronco,"I ordered this for my mother in law for Christmas because the glass broke on her old one. She was going to roast game hens for our Christmas dinner so I paid extra shipping and handling to ensure we had it in time for Christmas. The product arrived in time but the box had looked as though it fell off Santa's sleigh. When we removed the rotisserie, it had a huge dent on the top. I was VERY disappointed and returned it and ordered it from another website and found it $20 cheaper to boot!"
1,awful product should be taken of the market,I bought this product dispite all the negative feedbacks I saw in Amazon and all the reviews are so truth. It causes fumes even if you put a small roast I tried to make a small pork leg which was less than 8 pounds and it burn. Please ignore the set it and forget it gimmek if you forget it you will burn down your house
4,Ease of Use,"The Rotisserie is a great convience in cooking, but there are some problems with it's use. The gloves they send you to handle the food on the spit are too small. When you remove the food when done, you must use more than special care that the removable wheel doesn't fall off as ours did and nearly hit us on the foot. The construction of the glove is such that it is not heat resistant on the back of the glove, as on the palm area, and I found that out after burning the back of my hand while wearing the gloves."
2,I didn't/dont like the fact that you cannot find asseccories,This oven is hard to find asseccorries for and the orginal box didn't have the smaller grill in it and while running it it grates against the back and makes noises.
1,Do not buy From Ronco,"Do not Buy any Rotisserie from Ronco. The product works fine, but you will not EVER be able to get replacement parts. I need a PRO-Male Gear W/PRO Split Rods Attachments and I ordered them almost 9 months ago and they keep telling me they are back ordered. I cannot use my machine because they can't get me the ordered parts.If a company can not provide the needed replacement parts, then the product is useless. I asked them to send me a new one, but they wouldn't do that either. They did say after me getting very upset they would send the parts for free and when I could expect them to arrive. I have been waiting for 9 months and nothing and I bet you I never get them either. Again, this company can not take care of its customers and its slogan ""sstisfaction guranteed"" is not true."
4,Rusty expensive baskets,"Cooks great chicken! I recommend you spray your baskets with cooking spray as it helps release the cooked food a little. Beware the dishwasher. Take good care of your baskets as they are prone to rust if any of the nonstick coating comes off. New baskets are only available in a $50 ""Accessory Package"" Nice marketing Ron!!"
1,Risky to buy.,"I purchased the Ronco 5000 and used it 4 or 5 times and it shorted out and will not work at all. Since I have only had it a couple of months, I expected that the compny would replace the item for free. Nope! They want another twenty seven dollars to send me a replacement. I guess it costed me about $25 / chicken so far. Plus, when I called the company about the product, they basically sent me through a series of dead end supervisors and ultimately to an answering machine. VERY frustrating experience. BEWARE!Update: I contacted the company again and they said that they will review my case and let me know if they will wave the 27 dollar shipping charges. They will let me know in a week and then I will post the results."
2,Terrible customer service,Only worked once--Ronco says parts are not available!! Says we are not there customer. Blames Amazon for purchasing from someone else.
3,Best for chicken,"I've had one for a few years.Chicken is delicious cooked this way.They aren't as well-made as they should be. the plastic on the side broke and I have to put in in place every time I use it.I didn't think cleaning it was that big of a task. I found the top ""steamer"" more os less useless. And the cord gets hotter than I feel comfortable with. I would never leave it unattended.Furthermore, it doesn't take 2 chcikens unless they're small ones and I really question that a 14 lb turkey would fit.You can't beat it for cooking succulent chicken,so I would probably buy it again.Just know this is NOT a a 5 star appliance."
1,Set it and forget it doesn't work,"My unit came through with a broken part. A plastic strip on the bottom left portion of the unit where the door is to attach was broken. There is another issue with the device in that when the rotating part that holds the food is inserted in the oven, the gears on the 6"" round part with gear teeth does not mate with the drive gear. The two gears are about 3/16ths of an inch apart. Unfortunately, I destroyed the packaging that the unit was shipped in trying to get it all put together. Now I have no way to send it back cleanly. I have searched the Amazon site to find a person I could consult with to no avail. This makes a great case to shop in stores where you can discuss the problem and find a simple resolution. The Rotisserie is a great item. I owned one before and love the food it cooks. Just don't buy it from AMAZON."
5,I like it,"I've been using my Showtime Rotisserie for over 5 years and it has cooked some of the best turkey, chicken, rolled pork roast, Cornish hens and rib roast I've ever eaten. I only use my regular oven for breads and pizza now. I don't just ""set it and forget it"" though. I like to baste/brush my food while it's cooking so it takes a little longer to cook since I open up the door from time to time but it's very well worth it.Clean up is easier if the drip pan is lined with foil and the rest scrubs up well enough. Anything baked on that can't be removed is called ""patina or character"" Anyone who has an old oven that's absolutely spotless never uses the dang thing. LOLI like to slow smoke and charcoal grill food as well but that's a whole other set of results and I can't do that indoors in ""my"" kitchen anyway.As a man in his 40's, I highly recommend this product."
2,PIECE OF JUNK,"As far as its cooking performance, I had no problems. After awhile, the feet began to disintegrate. I called customer service to get a couple of replacements which I could do myself but they wanted my to ship the whole thing back for service. It cost me close to $50.00 for shipping. I got the machine back repaired but a few months later I had the same problem. I finally ended up throwing the thing away."
4,Mature product better than ever and lower price,"The Ronco rotisserie is our second; the first died after probably about 4 years of continual use. The new one has several non-stick surfaces which make if much easier to clean. Ours cooks a broiler chicken about once a week; ever flawlessly with crisp skin, and juicy meat, and just following instructions never over or under done. We have not mastered cooking other meats on it, but I have tasted excellent results from those who have; just a lack of testing on our part."
2,Not like it used to be,"Had a Ronco Rotisserie previously. When the element burned out, I ordered a new one. The left foot was broken from day one causing the door to come off in your hands when you open it. RONCO is not enthusiastic about fixing the problem, they seem to throw barriers in the way of doing anything about it. It doesent seem to be made as well as the original one I had."
2,Great idea but...,"I've had problems with this rotisserie because it smokes from time to time. I have to leave my stove fan on and finally I just put it outside. Then it started squeaking. I put vegie oil on the turning points but it didn't help much. Cleaning the unit and taking chicken out of the unit isn't easy. Why doesn't the inside have a non-stick surface is beyond me. This smokey dirty squeaky mess is now permanently outside. In fact, I think I will go outside right now and kick it."
4,Great Product!!,We made two chickens in the Rotisserie. They came out wonderful. The rotisserie did not burn the chicken. We did not get any strange fumes other customers got. Chicken came out moist and delicious. Wonderful product!!! Easy to use and easy to clean up. And shipping was quick. I got is a full week before the estimated ship date. Great work Amazon!!!
5,Nothing Beats Set It and Forget It!,"I purchased my first Ronco Rotisserie at least 10 years ago and used it until it literally fell apart. When I went to look for a replacement in 2010 I was disappointed that I couldn't find one, and I settled for one of the new products on the market - it was okay but didn't cook the same as a rotisserie. As I was doing my Christmas shopping online last year I discovered that Amazon had some Ronco rotisseries in stock so I bought myself a Christmas present - and it's the best present I got! It makes the best turkey I have ever tasted and does a supurb job on everything I have used it for including beef and pork roasts, chickens, steaks, and fish. I am very pleased to have found this product - again."
3,So you're thinking of buying a Ronco,"This is a decent machine, but it is not without it's faults. If you're thinking of buying one let me give you a few words of advice.1. Any kind of poultry you cook in this machine will turn out excellent. For me that was reason enough to buy it because I always overcook my poultry in the oven. When it comes to beef and pork, i can't recomend using this machine. It gives the food a funny taste, and you're better off cooking beef and pork on the barbecue.2. The commercial claims that it is easy to clean. Maybe so, but I don't own a dishwasher and it is a pain to clean. There are several parts that require furious scrubbing, taking some time and effort to clean. For those of you with a dishwasher it may be easier, but you would still have to scrub off the grease remenants before loading it in the washer.Overall I do enjoy this machine because it allows me to cook a quality whole bird. If you have mastered cooking poultry, this machine will be a waste of money."
1,RONCO SHAM,"I got this unit as a Christmas present. The first three times it worked great. Since then, the timer is off, and the heating element does not give off enough heat. Most times I have had to increase the cooking time by 25% or more. The unit first arrived with broken legs, and it took 7 weeks to get RONCO to replace them. At first they wanted to charge me $35.00 for them. Then, they said to return the unit for replacement. (Shipping costs were about $45.00, non-refundable). Finally after many letters and complaints, they sent out new legs. I am very disappointed at the lack of customer service and the shoddy product. My George Forman Baby rotisserie worked so much better. DON""T BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK!!!!"
4,platinum rotisserie,this is all that i had expected. tried a pork loin on new years day and it came out perfect. still need practice on steaks but will get it. vey easy to clean. would recommend this to anyone.
4,love it,I had the older version for 10 years & really loved it but it was getting old. I ordered this one. It came with a dent in the bottom but I was able to get it out & it works perfectly. Absolutely love the machine. I want to get another for my sister but they are sold out here. Will keep checking.
1,I would strongly disrecommend,"It sounds like a good system if it worked. You cannot use this system or the indoor camera if you or your neighbors within 300 feet have: a wireless computer network, or a cordless phone (2.4 GHz), or a microwave that is running. I'm not kidding - I can't believe this even passed testing. I think MobiCam has a newer system that you should investigate owning. Those have lots of reviews. Pay attention to them!"
1,"And yet, another Chinese disappointment","I bought my first Schrade ""Uncle Henry"" Steelhead Knife over twenty years ago. Back then, it was made in the USA and the blade thickness was .098 inch (a tad less than the thickness of TWO dimes stacked together). The one I received from Amazon was made in China and the blade thickness was .039 inch (one half of the thickness of a SINGLE dime). The current model should be consigned to no more strenuous a task than filleting half pound Perch. I was so dismayed at the lack of quality in this current rendition of a time honored classic fillet knife that I didn't send the knife back to the Amazon distributer, instead, I sent the knife back to the manufacturer with a letter so scathing it would make this review appear to be an actual endorsement. Once upon a time the name ""Schrade"" on a knife was a source of pride. Today, it proves little more than an apology. My current recommendation is to buy the ""Kershaw"" brand instead."
3,"Quick questions, but not amazing.","Flash cards, that aren't flash cards. Printed in a flashcard format, with multiple cards to a page. As to the interactive part- well I've no idea what the author/publisher means by this. Is it interactive because you have to turn the page to see the answer?It is less likely to be cluttered, or it could be cut out and made into traditional flash cards, if you desired- seems like a lot of work to me (but hey that would be really interactive!). All in all a reasonable book, I didn't fact check it- but it wasn't really high yield, and can't be recommended as anything other than an auxiliary resource. Perhaps a bathroom book?"
5,The Best Rock Mag ever!,"This really blows them all away, Blender, Rolling Stone, the old Circus and Creem magazines, the closest to it was Kerrang. They have the best articles and pictures, a great reviews section!. I'm glad Amazon offers a Subscription to it!. Try it, I'll bet you can't put it down!."
1,No Power out option...,"This winich has no power out option, it's only power in on the handheld. I tried to revise the input wires but doesn't power out! It's most loud/noise winch I've ever had. (make sure wear ear plugs). Amazon does have a good customer service for refund it."
2,Disappointing Winch,It locked up. I resorted to yanking things with a truck. I'll try freeing the cable and may try again.
3,"It's OK, BUT.....................",I drive an '06 Extended Cab Silverado and the cable that goes from the battery to the power connector on the winch doesn't; it's about 2 feet too short. I considered returning it but decided it would not be difficult to extend the cable. I also wish it was powered in both directions so it could be used for lifting as well as lowering. Maybe by reversing the polarity it will. If I burn it up trying I'll have a door stop with a handle. On the plus side it seems to be well built. I haven't found an actual use for it yet but I'm sure something will turn up.
4,Works good for an occaisional winch,I welded the mount plate to my utility trailer. It works good for dragging a riding mower up the back. Used it for some construction stuff to. Not super duty or quick- but gets the job done.
4,Watch the amperage on this unit,I just ordered this unit to use inside my garage to hoist up a utility trailer that I want to stand on end to make more room. I needed to buy an ac to dc converter to power it and the specs do not state the current draw. I called Master lock and they told me 4 to 6 amps for a several hundred pound load - and 20 amps at the maximum 2000 pound load. That is a lot of current so make sure your adapter and/or car outlet can supply the current needed.I will post back once I have had a chance to use it.
3,Works good but kind of slow,Bought this to pull golf carts onto a utlity trailer and it has no problem pulling the carts up it just goes alittle slow. One issue I have is that you have to hook this up directly with your battery and with this mounted on the front of my trailer the power cord is not long enough to reach the battery on a full size pick up.
4,Winch worked well,"THis is a nice unit, I am using it to pull a car that is being restored back into the garage, It has a long remote cord so you can stand out of the way,"
2,Slow and Noisy,I returned this unit as it was so noisy you couldn't carry on a conversation within 15 feet of it. I don't know if the unit I had was defective or if that was the design but it wasn't acceptable either way. The unit is also very slow on the retrieve and doesn't have a power reverse. I ended up getting an ATV winch for only a few dollars more which is very quiet and twice as fast. The one really nice feature to this Master Lock winch is the portable mounting bracket that can just hook over a trailer hitch ball so it doesn't need to be installed permanently on any vehicle.
2,"Worked grear first time, then the clutch would not release 2nd try","I loaded my boat, took it to lake. The clutch would not release so cable would spool out when I went to load the boat out of the lake."
1,Do not buy !,"Seems like a good deal...but...Poor quality and NO PARTS AVAILABLE !!This was aparently meant to be a disposable winch, and is built like it."
5,Works Good,This is not a bad winch for $60 to $70. If you want a heavy duty winch you should buy a Warn but they are 5 to 6 times the cost.Most people are not using a winch every day. If that is the case with you then this Master Lock winch will do the job for a great price.
1,Master Lock 2953at,Not good for my use... to pull a small sailboat out of the water onto a beach.The 30 feet of cable was just what I needed but retreval was way............. too slow. Were talking 5 minutes to go 10 feet. Did I mention noise. Loud.So it may work well for a very short distance (3 feet) but if you need it done today look for something more expensive. The quality of the unit was good.
4,Works well,"Works well, does everything I needed it to do. Added a pulley to reduce the load. I use it to raise 1600 to 1800lb large hay bales. Only thing additional I would have liked would have been a switch to lower the load rather than releasing the clutch. Otherwise, very happy with my purchase at an exceptional price."
4,Master Lock Portable Winch,"The winch was a little difficult to mount on my boat trailer, but the trailer is quite old. It works well to retrieve the boat. It had a minor problem regarding the clutch. I was unable to release the clutch for free wheeling the cable out until I removed the two bolts that were locked back to back on the shaft. They were set too close to the winch and would not allow the clutch to swing free.I do enjoy using the winch. It is a nice change from the hand crank I had bee using."
3,More trouble then it's worth in time savings.,"The winch does a fair job of pulling my dock up the steep bank (even though it seems to take forever.) The real issue is when I have the cable all the way out. During the wind in process the cable does not spool evenly! It jams over to one size and creates a birds nest.In my case that birds nest was also winched in tightly making it extremely difficult to unwind (took 30-40 minutes.) If all you're doing is pulling a few feet no big deal, winch 15 feet or more then you'll have issues like I did.I would not recommend this product, but instead would recommend looking for a better designed winch. If I wasn't out of the Amazon return window this winch would be in the mail right now."
3,A good explanation of ASP.net but...,"The review by ""Southern California .NET User Group"" pretty well sums up my impression of this book. Contrary to what that review states, there is source code download available at http://www.awprofessional.com. However there is a little too much shovelware in this book, space that could have been devoted to more in depth coverage. People with intermediate ""ADO.old"" experience and knowledge of C++/C#/Java will benefit most from this book and it is certainly better than the online documentation at Microsoft."
2,Not for real programmers,If you are really looking for programming I would suggest go for some other books. This book I bought just because of reading some reviews but after reading the book I realize it was not true.According to me this is a book for level - starter.
3,No download,I would never buy this book if I knew that it is not accompanied by downloadable source code.
4,Enjoy fewer canker sores!,"This tooth paste has been a life saver. If you suffer from canker sores using this tooth paste will be a great help in reducing them. I wouldn't use anything else. It's a great product. (It's a shame the tooth paste gets a little think as it's used up, and harder to get out of the opening of the tube, but who cares!)"
5,Kanker Sore Relief!!!,"This is the best toothpaste I have found to help avoid kanker sores. Also if you have a kanker sore, it won't irritate it. And it actually shortens the length of time you have the sore. Relief at last!"
5,Natural Toothpaste,This is a wonderful toothpaste. It makes my mouth feel fresh and clean. My teeth are whiter than before and I appreciate the enamel saver.
4,Ilke to brush my teeth,"I purchased squggle to stop the sores in my mouth as seen on Dr. Oz, I still have some leisions for the first time in my life, but I can feel the gentleness of the toothpaste."
5,Pleasant taste; my teeth feel clean.,Seems like a very functional toothpaste! It tastes nice and my teeth feel smooth and polished after using it.
5,Clean teeth and nothing more,"I was struggling with canker sores constantly before I changed to Squigle toothpaste. I still get the occasional sore, but it's usually from accidentally biting a cheek or lip and not just spontaneous. A tube of Squigle seems to last a long time as well so the added cost isn't really an issue. The taste is refreshing without being overly minty and the dispenser works well to keep the cap area clean. Overall, this is a product that I reorder every time because it just works and I have no complaints."
2,too many ingredients,When my dentist recommended remineralization I assumed this product would be ok.I took it to her and she read the ingredient list off the box. She asked me if I wantedall those chemicals in my mouth. I told her I did not. I returned the product.
4,"Not used yet, but has FLOURIDE","Just got this in the mail today. -Looking fwd to said relief... not sure about that part yet, but I had no idea when I bought it that it had FLOURIDE in it, so I'm just warning the newbies!! ;-) I'm not a flouride fan, so...But hopefully, this will do the trick for my sensitive teeth/ gums! ;-)"
3,Worth giving a try,"I was searching Google for a paste to help heal bleeding gums and i found this. It is a bit helpful i believe, so i would say it is worth trying once. I cannot comment if it helping saving enamel though :)"
3,squigle,Quick shipping. Havn't used it much. I was disappointed that it contains flouride & this wasn't mentioned in the description.
1,"yeah, no",I recently found out i am not able to handle SLS and thought this would be perfect for me because of all of the positive reviews. I am a dental health care junkie and love my teeth. I used this for a week and promptly threw it in the trash. it didn't help me clean my teeth and when i get up in the morning my teeth felt more nasty than before i brushed them. this stuff sucks!
5,Irritation relief,"Have not yet proven it is an enamel saver ( too soon to know ). However, it definately diminishes ( or eliminates ) irritation to sensitive mouth linings and gums.Purchased four tubes to try out the product,,,,, then purchased 12 tubes !!!"
5,Love Squigle,This toothpaste has saved my son a lot of pain that results from mouth sores. I had read and researched a toothpaste that would help with this and over & over again others recommended Squigle. My dentist was pleasantly surprised that I found a toothpaste without SLS (Sodium Laureate Sulfate) and had Xylitol in it.
5,It tastes great,"I am not eating the toothpaste, but it tastes great! I enjoy brushing with this toothpaste a lot. My teeth feel cleaner with it."
4,this one doesn't sting,"I bought this toothpaste in hopes of alleviating my frequent canker sore problems. I always dread brushing my teeth when I have a canker sore because it hurts so much. But I decided to try Squigle because it's highly recommended to uses SLS-free toothpaste if you struggle with the nasty mouth sores. While Squigle alone didn't really stop the outbreaks, it IS a very gentle and comfortable toothpaste to use. It does not burn if some gets into the sore. However, I am not sure I will buy it again though because it is a little expensive, and I can buy SLS-free toothpaste at several local health shops for a lot less money. Also, it just does not do the same cleaning job as regular toothpaste with tartar control or whitening agents. I like my teeth to feel SMOOTH, and after a week or so of Squigle my teeth feel like they need some regular toothpaste."
5,This stuff ROCKS!,"My husband and I started using this tooth paste five years ago and neither one of us has had a cavity sense. I have had two children during this time- so that is saying a lot. One, because growing a baby takes a lot of nutrients from your body. Two because I would get so busy and realize it was 8 pm and I still hadn't brushed my teeth sense last night!?! Yeah, I know! I SWEAR by this product."
5,The best toothpaste I have found,"This is the best toothpaste I have found to date, after trying many others. It is the only one I have found that doesn't have SLS, but still has fluoride. It also tastes and works great."
4,Nice non-SLS toothpaste,"This is a nice non-SLS, low abrasive, high Xylitol toothpaste, with a moderate peppermint flavor. I'd rather have no flavor."
4,Not too bad,"I've been undergoing head and neck radiotherapy and read that Squigle might help with the mouth sores associated with the treatment. Squigle tastes good and doesn't irriate my mouth like my Crest toothpasted did. I can't say that it's preventing or healing my mouth sores, but I don't think that it's contributing to them. I have trouble giving anything a 5 rating because that should be reserved for ""perfect"" products. I like this toothpaste. You probably will, too."
5,Big help with canker sores,"Well, it's been said already, but I have to add to the chorus. I found Squigle a few years ago and it has dramatically reduced by canker sore problem (estimate 75%).SLS is a primary culprit, but not the only one. I recently tried the Rembrandt SLS free product and it made things MUCH worse for me. So, stick with Squigle!"
1,Warning: Multiple Versions with the same title.,"Just a warning: If you're purchasing this video for nostalgic reasons (i used to rent it from the local video store every weekend when i was little,) you'll be surprised to know that the publisher of this video has re-cut and ""improved"" this video at some point since it's original release while retaining the ""Track Freaks"" name.I just purchased a copy this past week, and gone are the segments about TV Tommy Ivo, the Green Mamba, the interviews with the driver of the Botown Express, the natural gas-powered funny car, and the hydrogen peroxide rocket car. The ONLY segments that remain completely intact from the original video, in fact, are the Masters of Disaster (probably the worst part of the original!) and the Wild Bunch.If you've never seen this video before, It's no better or worse than the original (probably) but if you're trying to revisit this video from past viewings, beware that you may not get what you expect."
4,Wish a third edition had been made.,"The Photometrics Handbook is an indispensible item for theatrical lighting designers and production electricians because it has the photometrics of almost all of the US conventional lighting instruments that one would come across.My only regret is that the author did not make a third edition to include the conventional instruments that have been created since the second edition was published. Also, these days, LED and automated fixtures would be a great addition to the book."
4,Fun kid's show.,Piggly and his friends are adorable. The occasional trouble they get into and the ways they learn new things are hilarious.
3,"a good song, a so-so single","As much as I like Liz Phair, I could not recomend shelling out the bucks for this disc unless you just have to get anything she's ever released. The title song is great, but if you're a fan, you already have it. The edited version deletes the song's only expletive, so you're not really missing anything. ""combo-platter"" is a fairly lack-luster song from the rather lo-fi girly-sound tapes that really doesn't do the girl justice anyway. If you're buying it just for ""combo-platter"", do yourself a favor and try to track down a bootleg copy of girly-sound."
3,eh!,good 90's grunge pedal if your into that kinda stuff or early 80's metalica. This pedal didn'twork out for what I was shooting for but other than that its descent.
1,Save the 9 bucks,"This item is garbage; I purchased it about a month ago and already dumped it in the trash. Sure it looks and sounds good but take it from me, it's not worth the frustration"
1,Worthless,"This little machine is not worth the cost of the plastic to make it. I assumed, since Wahl has a long-time history of manufacturing grooming products, that this would be a quality item. Was I ever wrong. This trimmer is constructed poorly and doesn't cut hair. It will be heading to the trash."
1,"Cheaply Made, Didn't Last Long","Purchased this product because of the Wahl name. I own their plug-in electric hair groomer and it is powerful and well made. Unfortunately, this nose trimmer is not of the same quality. It is cheaply made foreign junk with the Wahl name stamped on it. The cutter actually did a decent job, for a week or two. Then started having trouble with the little motor, wouldn't turn or cut. I took it apart and the motor looks like a cheap motor from a toy in a happy meal. Waste of money. os"
1,Not the item pictured.,"The item in the main picture is not this model. The second picture is this model. So, if you expect to get the flat bladed oscillating trimmer in the main picture you will be disappointed."
1,Very Misleading,These scrubbing brushes are presented like they fit the Gloss Boss. They do not. Very misleading very frustrating and a waste of money!!! Buyer beware!
2,Couldn't give me product information,"Company that furnished product could not tell me via email if the brushes fit the buffer I purchased or not. They could not give me any information on how to change the brushes out on the Gloss Boss. Instead, the sent me on a wild goose chance to find out the answer myself. Other than that, they delivered quickly."
5,Scrub Brushes for machine,"We purchased extra brushes for the machine we purchased. We like the machine and brushes. This time we used it on our Berber carpet, but we will use it most on the tile floors. we would recommend to others."
1,Not so durable blades,"You get what you pay for. In this case, you get packages of multiple blades out of necessity. By the very nature of coaxial helicopters (counterrotating upper & lower blade) designs, the possibility of the upper & lower blades striking each other during extreme maneuvers, exists. The more flexible the blade, the more likely the strike event. These blades are VERY flexible. You don't even need to try very hard to ding, chip, or tear them.These blades will fly fine until you can get better blades. I've gone thru 5 sets of blades in about a month. After installing a better quality (Xtreme) blade, I've gotten no strikes, nicks or chips on the new blades.If you're an aggressive flyer, get 2 3-packs of upper blades + 2 3-packs of lower blades to last you while your order of better blades is in the mail."
2,"They are what they are, standard blades","I have a Lama V4, and let me tell you these blades are what they are. Standard, stock replacement blades. They are very fragile as they bend heavily when in air. When in flight they ""cone"" upwards creating several opportunities for blade strikes, and when these blades strike they break.They work, but there are better options out there. Xtreme blades are one option. Also there is a company named Helitek-RC that sells basic ""Hardened white blades"" that work very well as well. Both alternatives will help minimize blade breakage. Helitek-RC sells their hardened blades (one set of upper and lowers in each) for 3.50 a package. Xtreme usually goes for around 5 a set of uppers or lowers. They may cost more per-blade, but you get your moneys worth out of either.These standard blades work. They will get you back in the air, but be ready to go through them like a hot knife through butter, especially if you try to fly outdoors."
4,Decent bike for the price.,"Purchased at Target Pre-AssembledI find this bike to be a good value at the 95 dollar price. I am an adult male (160lbs) and purchased this bike to have something to cruise around the neighborhood with my kids. Bike is fine for both off road and on. However it is somewhat heavy.I did peel off all the stickers and remove the chain guard, giving the bike a sleeker look. There was a warning sticker on this bike that says it isn't intended for freestyling. Which is odd since is sells with pegs and a detangler. I haven't attempted any tricks on it, but it does seem sturdy enough. The pegs are pretty heavy, I'm debating pulling them off to make the bike lighter.TL;DRNice bike for under 100 bucks, but it is kind of heavy."
2,Okay until it breaks,"I purchased this bike last fall for my 12 year old son. He enjoyed riding it for 3 months until the rear wheel bearing broke. It cost me $40 to have a bike shop fix it and explained that the original bearing was cheap and could not be repaired, so they had to replace the whole part. I guess I could have tried to return the bike, but to dismantle, package, and ship it seemed more of a headache that it was worth. I had hoped that this bike would last a couple of years until my son out grew it, but so far it has been disappointing."
2,Family6,"We ordered one of these bikes but actually two were delivered. Which would have been great if either had the right components to make it work. One bike made it six months before it ended up in the trash and the bike that we took all of the ""better"" parts for still runs but doesn't work great. I wouldn't purchase it again."
5,This is a great light to have,"I've seen these with belt pouches also, but it's usually higher priced. This is a fantastic light source for the techie or for the backpacker. I bought several and carry one on my belt at all times. You can't beat the battery life, or the performance for the price."
2,"Vague, advertisement for a consulting service....","My company decided to adopt PACE, and plopped this book down in front of all the engineers. It caused more chaos than we had when we started. The book describes several teams, but neglects to describe how to select the team members, how to get them to be effective in their jobs, or even what there exact team responsibilities might be, other than to do ""in depth analysis"". Fine, but what does *that* mean. Oh, you're supposed to hire the authors to come in and consult with your company and develop another document that describes this. Sorry, this is a non-starter."
2,Waterfall Method Revisited for Software Development,"This guide can be very misleading for those working in the software development world.Apply this method to Software Engineering, and you are revisiting the old Waterfall Method of software development. In today's E-commerce and e-Enterprise worlds, this is not a good place to visit for long. I would only recommend this to folks developing products in a manufacturing environment.However, Phase 0 Reviews could be a very useful tool on an executive level as a Project Methodology for initiating and prioritizing software development projects and ensuring a product's overall strategic fit while allocating development resources."
2,It ripped the first day we put it on!,As much as I love this entire set I must say that I am very disappointed with the fitted sheet. My husband and I were getting the babies room all ready i washed the sheet (as instructed) as we were putting the sheet on it ripped! It was a very tight fit we have a regular size crib mattress that I used for my first daughter and had no problems with the sheets I used for her! I plan on sending this back and hope to get a replacement.
2,disappointed,I had hoped this book would provide some helpful tips on how to teach the emotional skills children need.
2,Reach exceeds grasp of facts,"The reviewers on this website who claim Rashid is the only journalist who knows Central Asia are clueless about journalism in Central Asia. There are many journalists who know Central Asia far better than Rashid - check out Eurasianet.org, for example.Rashid's book about Afghanistan, Taliban, is excellent because he has spent many years living in the region and he knows some local languages and has seriously studied Afghanistan's history. Unfortunately, he relies on unreliable secondary sources for much of his knowledge of Central Asia and his book is filled with major and minor errors. He has an unsophisticated grasp of the Soviet era history of Central Asia and he makes wild speculations and overgeneralizations about the contemporary situation based on inadequate, hastily gathered information. Jihad is just Rashid capitalizing on his cachet and the publishers capitalizing on the public's hunger for quick and accessible information about this under-studied region."
5,Unbiased and Informative,"Usually any book dealing with any aspect of Islam or other religions is either blatantly biased for or against that religion. Rashid manages to pull the attribution of all things to religion out of discussing Central Asia. He effectively demonstrates the impact of political economy and historical features on the regions lack of stability. Then he shows how religion--in this case Islam--aligns with these historical trends and impacts the country. The part I really appreciate about this book is how he resolves all these aspects into the ""bigger picture"" of how it affects Central Asia. Reading this book will also enable you to see how social movements occur transnationally in a smaller region (Central Asia comprises 5 countries). Very timely for today's events."
5,Jihad well explained,"An excellent, as well as one more interesting work by Mr.Ahmed Rashid. A great insight on untold and uncovered activities of central Asian Pan-Islamic movements. The central Asian region is a growing issue of concern. Failure to address the humanitarian issues may lead to yet another major international crisis. Jihad well explained."
4,Problem for Central Asia,"The book is tedious, but comprehensive and does explain a lot that has been said about the region. It offers confirmation of many statements about the region, usually those offered without reference. Recommended for anyone interested in ""Fundalmentalist Islam"" and/or the politics of the former Soviet Uniion."
4,The Current Landscape of Central Asia,"This book starts with the history of Central Asia then talks about the current state of that area focusing on the rise of radical Islamic groups, mainly IMU & HT. The author provides some reasons for their rise and how this has affected the area and the world. This author also provides some solutions to the problems of this part of the world while holding out hope for mass reform through foreign support as a solution to the war on terror.Large oil reserves, oppressed people, human rights violations, mass poverty, mass unemployment, and radical Islamic groups put this part of the world front stage in the war on terror."
2,Didn't Hold Up Well to Drying,"I was very excited to get this. Out of the package it seemed like a good quality product. Before putting it on my son's bed, I washed and dried the set. Maybe I wasn't supposed to put the comforter in the dryer, but after I took it out (only in there about 15 minutes), the comforter was messed up. In several sections, it was like the stuffing material had melted together in a hard blob. Fortunately, this only happened in the corners, so it is not a complete loss. Keep the comforter out of the dryer, and you should be fine with this product."
2,No skirt,"I loved the bedding, but I wish it would have come with a bedskirt and pillow shams. I don't even know where to look for one that matches."
4,You get what you pay for,"It's a very cute set, but very very thin. I can tell this won't hold up forever, but I'm sure my son will want something else in a few years anyway.I would have paid a lot more for a nice set, but this matched the only pink camo set I could find for my daugher. It's not itchy, just clearly a low thread count. If you aren't trying to match the pink one, I'd suggest paying a little more for something else.Oh, and the sheets are a criss cross pattern, in case you can't tell from the picture. You get two pillowcases, one camo and one criss cross."
5,Great Boy's Bedset,"I would highly recommend this bedset. We've had it for quite a few months now and it's been through several washings and still looks new. The sheets and bedspread have kept their color well and are good quality. They aren't the softest in the world, but they are comfortable and great value for the price. And to top it all off - my son loves the camouflage!"
4,great set for the price,The boys (9 & 12) wanted camo bedding but could not agree on style or color. We bought this set in brown and blue. They look great together on their twin beds. The sheets aren't as soft as I would have hoped but they are okay for a while. I am very please with this set.
1,False title,This book is not a treatise about letters and lettering. It's just an empty book with no images. Great words without letters.
1,What's the point?,There are no pictures. No images. One of the main reasons for the download was for the images. I was very dissatisfied with this book.
3,too simple for a first grader,"this should be listed as mid-kindergarten to 1st grade, i think. my kindergartener loves it!"
5,Leapster Game First Grade,My kids enjoy this game. I think it provides excellent review for young learners. I think it is an excellent way to provide foundation whether you have an advanced younger learner or a learner who is in need of practice. Kids enjoy their game and may not realize they are practicing their learning skills.
1,Game did not fit the Leapster GS.,The game was ordered to fit a Leapster GS not a Leapster Explorer. The game was returned and never used.
5,Great game!,"My kindergartener, first grader and fourth grader all enjoyed playing this game. I even had a turn at it. And the price was definitely a plus."
3,Bought for future use.,I am not able to rate this product as yet because I bought it for my daughter to use once she starts Kindergarten she is currently in Pre-K. I do believe after trying it myself that she will like it as it is a new learning tool that she will love to try when the time comes. Once she has begun using it I will re-rate this product.
5,Garden Days Journal,"This book appeals to both the art admirerer as well as the seasoned gardener. You can leaf through the seasons with every page of Karen's wonderful, energetic artwork and enjoy this journal only on the visual level, or you can use it as a very practical record of your own gardening ventures. It is designed to flip over in a flat position so notes can be made and pictures or information can be taped to pages. There is room for it to expand as you add vital information and customize it to suit you. It works! It's hardy. It's inspirational and it's fun."
4,sounds like teetering on the edge of (in)sanity,"I saw these 2 play in a small student ballroom back at college and they were great. Intense vocal and guitar work that grates in a beautiful way. Only 4 stars because their sound is rather limited, but they're good at what they do."
1,NOT WORTH THE MONEY,I got my savvy a little over a year ago. I paid the extra money because my daughter has allergys and it was supposed to be great for that plus it had to clean light... When it worked it was great!!!!! Until about a week ago the roll bar on the bottom stopped working!!! This is my second hoover vacuum in 3 year!!!! I will NOT buy hoover anymore.. My Mom has had her dirt devil for 20 years maybe i'll try one of them next...
2,Not a good long term vacuum solution,"This vacuum worked great the first month we had it, as in amazingly clean carpet. From there, the reliability and performance suffered. I would vacuum my floor, and it pick up virtually nothing. Yes, I regularly emptied out the cannister, so this was obviously not the problem. I disassembled some of the bottom portion of the unit, and cleared out the vacuum tubes. I'm pretty sure I violated the warranty by doing this, as by disassemble, I mean unscrewing a dozen screws and removing half a dozen or more parts, not just snapping things apart(nothing here was in the instruction manual). After clearing the lines out, it worked decently again. However, now the main three-way power switch is hosed, so I have to really fiddle with the switch to get into the correct position for vacuuming. For $200+, this just isn't worth it. I wish I would have used that money to buy a Dyson. Hoover just isn't what it used to be."
1,Complete Junk,Bought this worthless pile of plastic a bit over a year ago. The switch on the handle is going out and the brush has stopped working. We are going to have to buy a new one. Never buy a Hoover again.
2,Switch Broke after 1 Year,"We read reviews that said the switch was poor. We gave it a try because I love the green/red light to tell me to keep going over a spot of carpet. However, the switch was gone after a year. Furthermore, a piece of gasket between two halves of the main body became loose and moved into the tubing through which dirt travels. Pet hair and dirt then became clogged around the gasket plugging the whole system (no suction!). Very difficult to clean out and dislodge."
1,Would not recommend it.,"I would not recommend this vacume cleaner. It is junk. I tried to remove the bottom casing to clean the brushes and remove strings that tangel around the brushes. The screwes were so screwed so tight, that when I tried to remove them the plastic broke. Now I have to keep the casing on with rubber bands. I only had the vacume cleaner 1 month. It does pick up dirt on hard floors and the hepa filter is a mess. My mother has had her Hoover for 25 years. But I guess they just don't make them like they use to. I will never by a Hoover again."
1,Hoover Savvy Switch will break,"What a disappointment. Our Hoover switch also went, of course not until the 12 month warrenty expired. Can't get parts for just the switch but it looks like you can replace the whole handle if you want to try to repair it. I wonder what will break next and when. . . :("
1,Replacing belt for 5th time!,I've had the Hoover SAvvy for almost a year and a half and I'm now replacing the belt for the 5th time. I had to go to ebay to find the belts. The on-off switch has now been fixed 3 times!
1,Please don't waste your money.,"I bought this vacuum about a year ago. At first, like many others, I was impressed at how well this vacuum picked up pet hair and dirt. About six months after I bought it, I turned it on and it started making a horrible noise. All I did was turn the thing on. When I took it to the repair shop, they said that the motor was burned out and it needed to be replaced. 50+ dollars later (it was still under warranty), it was fixed and working fine. Now, six months later, the motor is making that noise again. The first time I thought it was me, but I'm not a crazy vacuumer; I vacuum about 3 times a week. It looks like I'll be buying a new vacuum because I refuse to spend another penny on this piece of garbage."
1,Very Disappointed,"I bought my Hoover Saavy one year and two months ago. The warranty lasts only a year - two months after its expiration, the motor burned out. I'm an engineer and know something about taking care of my vacuum cleaner and I did the maintenence to keep it running well. This thing performs well when it actually works, but it is a waste of money to buy a $300 vacuum cleaner that only lasts one year. Our local vacuum service person told me that this is not an uncommon problem with this type of vacuum because they used cheap plastic to make it. I just wish I had known that before I wasted my money. Consumer reports gave it a good review because it cleans well, but they didn't follow up on the vacuum's subsequent maintenence problems."
2,Suck (no pun intended),"We purchased this vacuum less than 2 years ago, after having to replace another Hoover. Within the 2 years we are having an electrical problem with the switch. For the amount of money we paid, we expected it to have a longer life expectancy. We agree with other reviewers, there was absolutely no customer service. We were apologized to and blown off. After going through 2 bagless Hoovers in 4 years, we will stay far away from the Hoover name."
1,Big mistake,Bought this model from Costco - used it with the included HEPA bag (bagless HEPA is too messy) and have been very disappointed. It doesn't pick up even the lightest item from a bare floor and is hard to push on carpet. I can live with that BUT the constant blowing of air straight up into my face from the lower filter is totally unbearable. Can't even breathe when vacuuming. Will be returning it for a Eureka 4870 which Consumer Reports seems to like.
1,Dumpster-worthy,"After 15 months of occasional use, my Hoover Savvy no longer works. Although this vacuum worked great at first (despite being extremely heavy and hard to maneuver), it soon started having problems.First it seemed to have a short of some type. I would have to jiggle the switch ""just so"" to make it turn on. Next, the headlight refused to come on. Shortly thereafter the vacuum stopped picking things up at all. Instead, it merely blew the debris into the air and around the room.I was always religious about regular maintenance and took excellent care of this vacuum so there is no excuse for such an early demise.Today when I took the vacuum out to the dumpster there was already a Hoover Windtunnel in the dumpster. At least I can sleep well knowing that my old vacuum won't be lonely at the dump--it will be surrounded by its Hoover peers."
2,Stylish....yet shoddy,"Got this set for Christmas. My fiance and I loved the look of it! HOWEVER... the second time we used the corkscrew, it broke. And what do you do with a lovely matched set with a broken corkscrew? It rather spoiled my feelings for it, not to mention having such a lovely set, then handing your friends a gas-station corkscrew (that outlasted THIS one by 6 months and counting...)"
5,DESCRIBED CORRECTLY,"Gauge works great, used with the sender; Sunpro CP7577 Oil Pressure Sender (bell shaped).This gauge is the ELECTRICAL OIL PRESSURE, meaning it requires a seperate sender and uses a wire to feed the signal from the sender to the gauge. The ""MECHANICAL"" oil pressure employs a nylon or copper tubing. IMO, the mechanical seems to be quicker on reading than the electrical, but I went with it anyway due to the new wiring harness I bought had the wires for it."
1,Wrong Item Description,"ITEM CP7957 IS NOT A TEMPERATURE GAUGE --- IT IS AN OIL PRESSURE GAUGE, SO I RECEIVED THE WRONG ITEM."
1,Misleading description,"The ""internal"" part of this unit is a joke. While you have to mount it into a drive bay, there is no capability to use internal USB or Firewire connections that are available within your PC. You must remove the cover from an empty PCI slot, run the supplied cables through your computer and out through the PCI slot opening, and plug the unit in using USB and firewire plugs on your PC's back panel."
1,Idiotic product,"I expected this to plug into an inside USB port, doing the obvious by giving me more of everything. That would be a terrific way to freshen up an old box. I was stunned to see that it came with 4 USB cables intended to snake through the box and come out the back through an open plate. Then I was supposed to plug these four cables into ports magically available on the back. Completely idiotic - have they never heard of something called a hub?As soon as I saw the cables and the installation diagram I packed it up and returned it."
4,KimberlyH,"We have been using this play yard for the last 4 months and it has some great positives but also some negatives.PROS1. We love the bassinet feature.2. Love the vibration option. It helped our son fall back asleep quickly after late night feedings and diaper changes.3. Diaper Changer is fantastic!4. The fabric is gender neutral. We have gotten several compliments on it and are glad we selected this particular pattern.CONS1. The bag only holds the playard and mattress. The diaper changer, and other items don't fit. It makes for a lot to travel with. Since our son is still young it would be wonderful if it was easier to take everything.2. We have never used the canopy. I wish instead of the canopy it had a mobile. Our son would have enjoyed that more.Overall this is a wonderful item and will get several years of use."
5,So convenient and baby loves it,I was in the market for an arms reach but decided to get this cause it converts to a play yard for a toddler. Baby loves it so far.
4,"Love the Pack and Play, MIssing Extra Pack Option","Like many reviewers have already stated, this would be a 5+ star product only if Graco had included a way to easily pack the bassinet option. I don't think the changer is as big of an issue for me as we stopped using that early on and you can change a baby anywhere. The bassinet is wonderful and works until the baby is about 15 lbs. Our little one is almost 4 months and still under 14 lbs. and we use this pack and play often enough to keep it packed in the trunk of our car. I am going to sorely miss it once she hits the weight limit. We have been creative and place the bassinet in a medium sized duffle bag along with pack and play sheets, swaddle, toys and any other gear we may need on the road. It would be fantastic if Graco provided a zip up bag for the bassinet/changer to accompany the pack and play. Overall very happy and hope to use it for many years (and children) to come!"
4,Great choice,"Compre este producto para mi Hija de 5 meses y esta excelente lo recomiendo, es bastante confortable e identico a la foto, excelente compraSaludosRC"
2,Durability is questionable...Folding mechanism failed after 2 years,"Had I written this review before this past weekend I would have given this pack-n-play 5 stars. We have had one of these for a little over 2 years and were completely happy with it until now. This past weekend a small plastic piece in the folding mechanism on the bottom of the play yard failed. GRACO is unable or unwilling to sell a replacement part and they have said there is nothing they can do. The customer service rep (contacted via email) was pleasant enough and gave us a rebate form which is good for $40. I don't know if we will spend almost $200 (again) for a ""premium play yard"" that wont last."
1,Terrible!,"This pack and play is SOOOO heavy and hard to put together. To top it off, it's made from materials that could possibly contribute to SIDS in a New Zealand study. The mattress materials are polyester and polyurethane foam. Polyurethane foam contains toxins that can possibly off-gas and can be VERY bad for a newborn or baby who is sleeping. I have not been able to find a travel crib that is made from natural non-toxic materials yet. This pack and play also reeked of plastic when I opened the box. That odor can't be good for a new baby. This product is also big and clunky and a total nightmare. I am sure it's all made in China too."
2,Poor for travel,"This pack'n play is a good all around, sturdy item. However, this does not travel easily. The entire pack'n play does not fit into the bag which came with the item. Therefore, I gave it a poor rating since to me a true pack'n play is easy to put up and easy to pack away into one bag. Also, this item is very heavy with no handles on the bag(awkward to carry). I do not mind the weight, yet it doesn't make packing it around easy.I think this is more of a stationary item that people use in their homes rather on trips. I will use it my on trips, since I do like the features and I am not eager to do more research on other options at this point in time. Just to let anyone out there who was looking for an easy travel item, this is not it. If you are looking for a more stationary pack'n play with great features in that case this is it."
3,Good and Bad...,"I love the look and style of this PnP, however, don't be in a rush to put it together, there are lots of extras that take some figuring out, due to the lack of good instructions.The pad for the bottom of both layers is so hard, but this is a complaint I have with all PnP's.One of the reasons I choose this one, was the changing station; however, they need a ""REAL MOM's"" help in a re-design...the holders are odd, it should hold a whole refill pkg of wipes, and there's no safety strap. I have a 6 mth old that grabs the edge, and pulls herself almost over the edge while I reach for a diaper. So keep your hand on them at all times while changing!My biggest frustration with it is the canopy...I love that it has the canopy, but whoever designed the velcro tabs that hold it up - is an idiot! So I have taken them off and made a better system myself.It is a nice PnP, but not worth the extra cost."
5,great PnP,"We got it for our little one, he's been sleeping in it since he was born, and he's now 4 months, it was easy to put together, good size, and the colors are perfect for any gender. I didnt really use the changing pad on this, cause baby would roll to the side, so I just detached it. and the little canopy its just ok, i just it just to entretain my baby with the bear hanging from it. I cant wait to use the playard and see our baby sitting in it playing with his toys."
2,The only good thing about this playard is a changing table,"We use this playard in our living room as a secondary sleeping space for our baby. Overall we are not happy with our purchase and here is why:1. Assembly is somewhat complicated. There are 48 steps you need to follow to get this thing assembled.2. Mattress is uneven. There is an air bubble in the middle of the mattress.3. Music is very quiet and off-key. Sounds like a broken record.4. Changing table has no buckle-up option so we will have to stop using it once baby knows how to roll over.Pros:We love the raised changing table, it is very good for our backs.The diaper pockets are very useful as well.Overall, I do not recommend this product"
3,Pretty but not completely functional changing table,Love the look of it and is pretty practical. The only downside is that the changing table never lays completely flat.
5,Muy buen patio,"Excelente producto, muy buena calidad y facil de armar. Cumple con todas las normas de seguridad, el sitema musical funciona muy bien. Muy buenas instrucciones, recomendado!!"
5,Good Stuff!,Very easy to put together. Beautiful colors and a nice high changing table so you don't break your back. I would reccommend this item to anyone who has a little one.
2,not worth the 50 bucks,i can save you the time and effort of reading this book. the main theme is to never discount your fees. that's about it. quick to read and kind of helpful but not the best book out there on recruiting.
1,"Outdated information, SAVE YOUR MONEY!",I have been a technical recuiter for 5 years and I found the information in this book to be outdated and hardly relevant to today's marketplace.
1,Not what we wanted...,"We ordered this video in hopes of getting a tape of baby faces and babies doing baby things... Instead we got a tape of preschoolers making faces, crying and doing bigger kid things! I don't know why they called it ""Baby Babbles"" unless the word baby means something different than what my family thinks it means. We got it for our 7 month old because we have heard over and over again that babies love this sort of thing and we intend to try and find another video that truly has babies in it in hopes that it will hold our daughters attention for longer than this one did. We also have 3 older children and they all gave this tape a thumbs down because they had expected cute babies, not bigger kids and annoying music."
3,OK Covers,"This is a decent cover album by a decent cover band, but you would be better off buying the real Dire Straits albums. Try out the free songs yourself and see what you think."
3,Rusts fast,"The no-stick coating is indeed very sturdy and this would be an excellent accessory for the toaster oven -- except... It rusts like crazy, after only a few uses too. I've tried this pan twice. I did put the first pan in the dishwasher, but when it started rusting after just 2-3 uses, I made sure that the second pan never went through the dishwasher. Yet the second pan started rusting almost as fast. After just one year the first one is pretty much rusted all over..."
3,toaster oven pans,"Pans arrived in good condition as advertised. Not as heavy duty as I would have liked, but very serviceable."
3,Much smaller than original pan for toaster oven,"While the pan works fine, although I've only used it a couple times so far, it's far smaller than the original that came with my toaster oven. I didn't notice the dimensions before ordering--it wouldn't have been a surprise if I'd read it online, but it only holds a couple pieces of toast, waffles, etc., and my toaster is a four-slice size. It's probably better to go back to the manufacturer and order new ones from them, so they'll be the right size for your toaster oven."
4,"Good quallity, but small","I bought two of these to use in our T-Fal toaster oven, mostly to bake cookies. It works extremely well, and comes clean with a wipe of a wet dishrag.My complaint is that this a small pan. I knew this when I purchased the pair and am not sorry at all that I bought them. But our T-Fal can handle an 8""x 12"" pan. If this item becomes available in a larger size I will be first in line to buy two more."
5,Small but good,"When this came, it was smaller than I expected, and I would have liked a bigger pan. That being said, I really do like this pan for my toaster oven, which is why I bought it. Food releases quickly from the surface, and I have had no problem with rusting, as one commenter had. I wash and dry them as soon as I'm finished with them, and they hold up well. I ordered three, and I may order three more - they are that handy. With just two of us in the house, it is a perfect size to make a few cookies and we avoid heating the house in hot weather. My central air went out this summer, and with two room-sized air conditioners and my toaster oven, I've been able to bake without a lot of suffering. These pans got quite a workout already, and I expect to get even more use from them in fall and winter, when we tend to have more company. You can't beat the price, and the quality is good."
3,measure to be sure,looks like a nice little pan - but it is too big for my toastation - make sure you measure before you buy!!!!!!!!!!
3,Disturbing,"This book was typical disturbing Rendell stuff. It kept my interest, but was not as good as some of her other work. She does tend to weave the various bits of the story together, but predictably; no surprises. The end of this was disappointing... it could have been much more dramatic. It was probably too realistic and that is why people didn't like it! The only other thing I did not like is that she really stresses Philip's (main character) aversion to violence, making it sound almost pathological. With this in mind, he does not seem bothered enough by Senta's talk of killing. Someone as sensitive as Philip would have to be wholly turned off by her deranged talk."
4,The Dating Pool Is Frightfully Shallow,"The Bridesmaid is a smart, original tale of madness as experienced through Phillip, a rather lack-luster young man with aimless ambition and no real life until he connects with Senta, who is quite obsessive, compulsive and (entertainingly) insane.Ruth Rendell is splendid at making a complete story where the front of the story completes the end. All the tribulations of the characters are interwoven, much like the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. There are no real surprises sprung out during the novel, but I am much more interested in the authenticity of the situation; it certainly feels real to me."
5,Chilling & Satisfying,"The Bridesmaid is the book that introduced me to Ruth Rendell.The Bridesmaid doesn't always rate as a favorite for Rendell's readers or critics, but it's near the top of the list for me. Her ability to crawl inside Philip's sexual obsession and his lack of certainty over what's real and what's imagined is brilliant. I also enjoyed the weaving together of the opening description of his aversion to violence and the gruesome violence that entered his life.Although the plot has been criticized as flimsy, I don't agree. I thought the circumstances held together to reach a satisfying conclusion."
3,A gripping read but a disappointing ending,"Please don't bother reading The Bridesmaid if you're addicted to Ruth Rendell's surprise endings. Although suspenseful until the last chapter, this novel has a predictable, dull conclusion. If you love Ruth Rendell, read Heartstones instead."
1,just couldn't get into it,"not up to ruth's usual status. i found philip stupid, naive and shallow. boy what you won't do for love and sex. the characters were unconvincing and stilted. i believe if i were in philip's place i certainly would have investigated the ravings of senta. christine was so childish it was totaly unbelievable. just too bizarre to be taken seriously as mystery. i was greatly disappointed in this book."
4,"4"" Hole saw","Works OK to put 4"" hole in a steel Jct box.... I forgot to buy the $8 Milwaukee arbor that goes between the hole saw & cordless drill. Saw blade jumps around if you do not use a clamped wood overlay."
5,A wonderful source for solving behavioral problems,"I found Ray's antedotal appraoch to behavioral problems very refreshing. By showing exactly what the owners were doing wrong, I was able to see if my problems were similiar enough to warrent the same correction. Ray really respects the fact that not all dogs are the same and as a result, he presents several remedies for the reader to try. In general, Ray showed me that we are always teaching our dogs, whether we want to or not. As a result, I am much more aware of timing, proper corrections and how I interact with my puppy. A must read for all of us lucky enough to have a dog in our lives."
5,A real missionary retelling.,"Rosalie Hall Hunt is one of my favoriters and her research paid off for this historical missionary retelling. Dr. Adnorium Judson and his wife Ann (who died in the Lord's service in Burma), and his two subsequent wives who later joined him in his mission work."
5,Simplified wisdom for everyone,"""How to Get a Life"" is a simple format with a powerful message: anyone can have a life. Each individual chapter is presented by a different contributor and expresses the life views and philosophies of some of the most famous, wise and fascinating people in history. I especially enjoyed the pieces on Joseph Campbell, Oprah Winfrey and Leo Buscaglia. Although not a history lesson, I learned more than I ever knew about Confucious and the Dalai Lama. This would make a wonderful gift for anyone, but especially a friend, relative or co-worker at a crossroads in their life. I found it stimulating, motivating and thought-provoking and am recommending the book to everyone."
5,Review of How to Get a Life,"This book is great. I liked the format. Each chapter provides insight into the thinking of a person who is a survior or a doer, or both! The life stories of Joseph Campbell, Jane Goodall, Mother Teresa, and many others, some famous-some not, was fascinating. But even more interesting was seeing the will of others in overcoming life's struggles. I have encountered a few ""dragons in the middle of the road"" of life. While each is a trial, the experience makes one a richer person. As a social worker, I will refer clients to this book."
5,Great book,I really enjoyed reading this book. The 15 essays had great messages that can be applied to your own life. I'm looking forward to the second round of books! Thanks Dr. McBrayer :)!
5,Delivered Promptly,As soon as I ordered the DVD I felt like I got it the next day. There wasn't any problems or delays with my order.
5,"Funny, well-written, engaging, and just a bit creepy!","Mim Warner's Lost Her Cool is not a typical ""girl in the city"" tale, despite the trendspotter premise. Messina mixes in a very odd group of characters to pull off a page-turner. Despite the title, Mim's not the main character - although she's certainly central to the plot. Mim runs a trendspotting firm and starts acting quite bizarrely. This forces those close to her to take extreme measures - but for one, Megan, things are more than just complex. Her dad is picking up women and singing in nightclubs to fill the void her mother's death has left, her ex-boyfriend Ian needs help promoting his new novel, her best friend chides Meg for using Ian. And then Ian's book starts showing up in very odd places. Definitely worth the read!"
2,Miss,"Red Dress Ink is a series in which I typically find hit and miss books.This one is a definite miss for me. While the basic premise is cute - I could never get into the storyline which felt as though it was being told from someone sitting in a corner who is never actually part of the storyline.The main character is so clueless that you want to scream at her.I enjoyed this author's first book, but have never really enjoyed the others and this one is no exception.This is a definite pass."
1,"Dont' bother, weak product from poor vendor.","After using this brush for a couple of weeks, the bristles - although seeming to hold up - were folding over. One I'd previously found at The Body Shop was around $12-$15, but they don't carry these anymore. It's just so hard to locate a good ""non-detachable"" brush (those detachable brush's heads always comes off while using the handle, which is obnoxious).This one's bristles finally became completely useless after a month, so I trashed it and bought a better one at the local Walmart (though I don't like shopping there). Target only carried one, as well, & it was cheap construction.The good news is that the Walmart one has lasted months now & appears to be decent. However, I wouldn't waste your ten bucks on this - or any brush I've seen here on Amazon."
3,Nice but not as durable as I would like,They are shorter than most brushes but I liked that they weren't banging into everything while showering from being too long. Nice feel to the bristles. What is disappointing is that the bristles are thinning already after a few showers. Inexpensive and handy yes but not that durable.
3,White is not really white,"This seems to be a beautiful light weight smooth and very soft blanket, but if you really want it to be white it's not. It's definately an off-white, creamy color when compaired next to white sheets and other bedding."
2,"hard to blow up, does not hold air.","the idea is great - a ball that changes color. that feature works ok, so i have no qualms with the material. the ball itself is poorly executed - there is no valve to keep the air in, just a plastic plug, that my child loves to pick on and open the ball. It is supposed to be inflated with straw, but there is no good way to insert the plug with the straw still in place... so it deflates very fast.maybe a magic playmat?"
2,gertie ball,I purchased this for my 18 month old grandson as he loves balls. I was not impressed. It does not hold air well and barely shows a hand print when he plays with it. He did not seem to like it either as it sat in the corner most of the time.
1,Don't buy this ball,"From the description of this ball it seemed to be a perfect gift for my 18 month old grandson. This ball comes deflated in a small package. It is only about 8"" wide when you inflate by blowing up by mouth. I was expecting a ball that would change colors when touched but this only happens if it is chilled first and stops happening as soon as the ball returns to room temp. (and that happens very quickly). I can't believe I paid this much for a ball that looks like a dollar store item."
2,Caution! Easy to remove small parts!,I bought this toy for my 2 year old grandson since he loves balls. Once opened his Dad inflated the ball and secured the plug and tossed the ball to my grandson who immediately stuck the plug in his mouth and removed it. The adults then played with the ball for a short while and it was put away as we deemed it very unsafe for my grandson to play with :(
1,Don't waste your money,"I have no idea if this ball does anything as advertised. It is nearly impossible to get the plug in after inflating and the end of the plug is not flush with the ball. It sticks out and is easily pulled out by my child. As other buyers pointed out, you have to use a provided straw to inflate the ball then try to remove the straw and replace it with the plug while keeping the ball inflated. If you leave the ball deflated enough to pinch the end while exchanging the straw for the plug, the ball will not bounce. If you inflate the ball until it is firm enough to bounce, you cannot get the straw out and plug in."
3,Doesn't Change color like expected.,Still a great ball for little guys even though does not change color like picture. Basically a pink ball that gets occasional white smudges on it. That is what we got at least.
3,Does not change colors,I ordered this ball for my 2 year old son who loves balls. I thought with it changing colors where he touched it that he would love it even more but once the ball arrived I noticed it does not change colors at all! My son played with it for a second then through it down to play with his sensory balls.
1,Might as well be a purple ball.,"I'm very disappointed with this item. I expected to get the ball in the mail and be able to give it to the babies in my daycare so they could see the marks their hands made--but boy was I wrong! Either this ball is so old that the hypercolor/heat reaction doesn't work anymore, or the product never lived up to its expectations to begin with! Has anyone received a ball that DID work? The ball I received changed colors ONLY when I held it up to a boiling, steaming crockpot! What babies' hands are THAT hot? Buyer beware!"
1,One major flaw,"I would like to echo Clayton Hill's review above. I would also like to add that these entry knobs will open from the inside while locked. This would be okay if it unlocked the knob, but it doesn't. My older knobs that I replaced, when locked, would not allow the knob to turn from the inside and outside. You had to unlock them to get out. I see this being a problem for me and a lot of others who go out to check the mail and, not realizing the door knob is locked, come back to find a locked door."
1,The Schlage name used to mean something...no longer.,"I have been working with locks from various manufacturers for years and had been a long-time fan of Schlage. They used to be known for quality and precision, and I have installed many of their locksets. Now things are very different. They now make most of their products in China and quality has taken a nosedive. The new locks lack the smoothness and precision of the old ones, and the construction is noticeably inferior."
5,For Perfect Bundt Cakes,"I have a cheap quality, thin aluminum bundt pan and every time I tried to bake in it, it burned... This pan is the absolute end all for traditional shaped bundt cakes. The cake cooked evenly and all the way through, no rotation required, and I can not recommend this pan highly enough. No more burnt bundts. Coat the pan gently with butter; sprinkle evenly with flour; when done, leave the cake and pan to cool(approx. twenty minutes) and the cake will fall out without any hesitation. Also, this is the BEST deal I have come across. Hope you have as many pleasant experiences as I have with Nordic Ware pans. Enjoy!"
5,Best bundt cake pan,I was looking for a bundt cake pan that was large enough to handle a particular recipe that I have. This is it! The cakes using this pan come out beautiful and it can handle a large size recipe.
5,amazing results!,"Received this just in time for thanksgiving & all the other reviews are right-I am not a good cook but this pan makes a big difference ,comes out of the pan easily and professional looking results. My father lives w/me and said""where did that come from?"". I made a moist apple cake that I have made several times and never did it come out so perfect & well cooked through out! Getting more of these high quality pans."
5,"Excellent, better than stoneware","This is an excellent pan.I borrowed my neighbor's stoneware bundt pan and liked the way it worked. However, the pan had a rancid smell to it. This Nordic Ware pan performs just as well and cleans up easily.Follow the instructions. Lightly grease and flour the pan before you pour the batter in. When you pull the cake from the oven set your timer for 10 minutes. Flip over the pan when the timer goes off and the cake slips right out. Then wash the pan out with a non-abrasive sponge or dish cloth and dry the pan out and put it away. Store the pan upside down so that you aren't tempted to nest inside any other pan or implement, which might scratch the interior pan surface."
4,An excellent light weight pan,Nordic has high quality products but personally I prefer the more expensive and heavier bundt pan they make for my large bundt cakes. For most baking users will find this pan adequate. My cakes usually require the 12+ cup bundt pan.
2,Not happy with quality,I am returning this bundt pan because it arrived with the non-stick coating worn off from rubbing on something on the top edges. Would like a replacement PLEASE package it better.
1,I miss my old Bundt pan,I hate this pan. Cakes never come out with a flat bottom. The center is higher than the edges resulting in a pedestal effect. I've made at least 4 cakes with this pan and had the same results with each cake. I'm going shopping to see if I can find a Bundt pan of the old model.
2,A Stickler,"This pan seems great, but it is not. It stick and sticks and sticks! Write 20 words? Ok, the pan sucks because it sticks. There you have it!"
5,It's worth every penny.,I've been using this pan for over 2 years - and it's just like brand new. Love it.
2,Pan received not same as shown...,"The pan I received was okay but was not what I wanted. The pan pictured has smooth handles and the one I received has the ""braided"" texture handles and the edges of the pan are really sharp as another review noted. It is a lighter weight than the one with the smooth handles. I already had an original platinum bundt pan and this was not the same. Mine is the heavier one with smooth handles. I will wait and order what I want later. I gave the one I received as a gift to someone. Since the price was good and it could serve as a gift, I didn't go to the trouble of returning it. It is troubling that the product is misrepresented in the picture."
5,Works beautifully,"I've used this pan several times since I bought it, and it has worked great every time. I'm not a great baker, and I wanted an idiot-proof pan; every cake I've baked in this pan has turned out perfectly. I do use non-stick spray with flour just to be on the safe side.I bought this pan to make a ""pretty cake"" for a party, rather than a lop-sided layer cake. I've also used it several times to make coffee cakes and banana nut breads. It's great for making different sized (height) cakes. It also cleans easily with hot soapy water."
4,Love it,"I finally broke down and bought this pan so I could make my Christmas cake without the frustration of the cake sticking to the pan. The inside pattern is not as pretty as my old one, but the cake did not stick this year!"
4,Review of the Franklin Sports Ready-to-go Hoops Basketball Game,"I ordered this item for my son as a Christmas present. When he opened the box the item was nicely packaged. When we assembled the item it was fairly easy, however, the sides was somewhat difficult to twist to keep the court rigid. Then, shortly, after my husband and son began playing the blue piece attaced to the hoop broke but, the sound still came on to give it the real basketball game effect. Overall, I rated it a four out-of-five; it wasn't all that I though it would be just from looking at the item on-line but, my son still loves it, and continues to play with it everyday so it wasn't a total bad investment."
3,Fun,"Bought this for my nephew and he absolutely enjoys it. I found it to be cheaply made. The backboard is cardboard, the pressure trigger that detects if a score was made doesn't always work. It would have been nice if it displayed the number of baskets made. I was expecting a better quality product."
4,"Not too bad, nephew LOVES it","I bought this for my 5 year old nephew who loves anything that has to do with sports. It was quicly assembled and we hung it from a closet door. He played with it for several hours on Christmas day. There are only minor suggestions for this game: the electronic part that gets hit when the ball goes through the hoop doesn't always recognize that the ball goes through, the balls are much smaller than they appear in the picture, and we wish it kept score. Otherwise, for the price, he loves it and I'm glad I got it for him."
1,Box has water stains and a moldy substance on it,"The inside box that the product is in was coated in dust and had what looks like a moldy substance on the side of the box. There was also some water marks on the box. Not happy at all with the quality of the box, which is a Christmas present!"
4,Fun reading even if you don't have any white vineger,"This book can help just about anyone in cleaning anything around the house. Using baking soda, vodka (!), and other assundry items provides one with enjoyable reading as well as imaginative jobs to do in the bathroom, kitchen, and the car."
1,bad experience,"This case somehow kept the Zire 71 powered on and soon completely depleted the battery, causing all the data to be deleted. This happened twice in two days, then I realized it was the case that caused this. I went back to using the little case that came with the device and then there was no problem. I do not recomment this case."
2,"Nice, but not practical","The case is very nice, it has a very elegant design and it is easy to access the device. But...there is a very big problem, somehow, whenever the palm turns on while the case is closed (for example: to warn you of an appointement)something in the case keeps the screen pressed, not allowing the palm to turn off after the programed minuts. It makes you run out of batteries completely and then you have to reset your palm loosing all you data (that you can luckly sync back from your PC).It's not practical. I wish it worked better....the design is very nice!"
3,"It doesn't smell, but that's not the problem.","While this carrying case doesn't smell of rubber with rotten oranges baked inside, I saw expecting it to be a little nicer. The Zire is held in place by an included velcro strip that is stuck to the back of unit like a sticker. At [$$] retail, I was expecting a carrying case like my friends Visor which has snaps to hold it in. It's fine for now, although I would have liked the blue carrying case better if it wasn't for that horrible smell."
2,Keeps Turning the Power On,"If you are investing in a PDA, you have to buy a case to protect your investment.....just not this one.We couldn't figure out why the Zire 71 kept running out of batteries within 24 hours. At first, we thought the Zire was defective. Eventually, we realized that the Zire screen was on a lot. Apparently, when the case it loaded with credit cards and such, it presses against the Zire 71's ""joystick"" which causes the PDA to turn on. If you have this item in your purse or a bag, pressure on the case will often turn the Zire 71 on.I don't recommend this item. We are still looking for a replacement and using this one because we have to."
2,Poor implementation,"I was disappointed with this case. First off, the ""latch"" takes too long to open and close. I should be able to whip the case out of my pocket and be able to open it with one hand. A thin button snap would have been ideal. Second, the case is too small for the Zire. It seems like the covers should have been a quarter inch wider to cover the edge of the Palm. As it is, the case leaves the edge of the Zire poking out and looks sloppy. A button snap may have helped this problem, too.It's been said before, but let me reiterate: adhesive velcro?!?! Come on!On the plus side, the stitching and leather are very nice. If you have something leaner than a Zire this case might work well for you."
4,Good for students!,"Before I bought this case, i read some reviews about it. Some claim that the case closes too tight and then it presses the on/off button of the handheld. In my particular case, that was not true. The handheld works perfectly with the case, no matter if it is tight. Perhaps the trick of a correct usage is the following: you must attach the rubber seal to your handheld in such a way that the handheld is mostly placed rightwards. Under this condition, there will not be any problem with the power button. It does not look bad: quite the contrary, the case is very elegant and protects your handheld. And in the States or in any other free country, the price shown in amazon.com is excellent. Here in Mexico we must pay 500,- pesos for the case in a departament store. This is more or less the equivalent to 45 US dollars!I hope this information will be useful to you in order to make a smart shopping!"
4,"Nice, but I didn't like the velcro!","I like the compact case. It is working great for me, but I do nont like that my Zire 71 is attached to the case with velcro. I was not crazy about sticking it to the back of my Palm... call me picky. The other thing is, that now I have expansion cards and nowhere to put them. If you think that by any chance you are going to get expansion cards, you might check out some other cases."
4,Great for homes with Toddlers!,"I recently received the Swiffer Carpet Flick, and have to say it's quickly become my new favorite cleaning tool! I have an 18 month-old son, and this has allowed me to clean up his cheerios and other assorted snack crumbs quickly, without dragging out the heavy vacuum. It does not, obviously, do as good a job as a true vacuuming would, however it does remove almost everything, including small crumbs. It's super-light, and a cinch to use. In less than a minute I can have his entire mess cleaned up, and the rug looking presentable again. Now if only they could come up with one of these for hardwood and tile floors..."
4,Litter Pickup,This thing is great for quick cleanup job rather than pulling out the vacuum. The guinea pigs kick litter out of their cages all the time and it is real nice to be able to grag the CarpetFlick to pick it up numerous times in a day. I would give it five stars if it picked up cat hair as well.
1,Terrible Product!,"You're better off buying a roll of masking tape, putting it over your hand, and patting down the floor - That's all THIS Product does. Honestly, all it does it run a sticky pad over your carpet. I use it on a TINY dorm carpet, and the cartridges fill up in less than 15 seconds. Seriously, they do.After buying this product, I think the CEO of Swiffer owes me an apology. Not only should he apologize to me, he should personally come to my dorm room and throw it away for me. It isn't even worth my time to walk to a trashcan."
3,swiffer carpet sweeper,you go through so many of them bacause it's just sticky paper. like the type you would get on a roller to clean pet hair. I give it 3 stars at best.
1,Nothing but a Giant Lint Roller,"Absolute junk! Cheaply made! If you're a pet owner, forget about this product; it comes nowhere near being able to handle picking up pet hair. The piece of ""fly paper"" inside quickly fills up, and all you end up with, as many reviewers have noted, is a pile of hair that will get pushed around the room. Save your money! Isn't it convenient for Swiffer that with all of their products, you have to continuously purchase some sort of a refill?"
4,I like it,"Works very well. I have two birds and this thing picks up seed, pellets, and feathers. It does pick up lint and hair as well. The hair and lint either stick to the brush like things on the bottom or the pad. It's very nice to use this instead of a vaccuum for quick cleanups, especially since I have a bad back I use each pad as much as I can before replacing it. They do pick up a lot, but I would like them to pick up a little bit more. The price here is too high though, you can get them for about half the price at Targer or Wal-mart."
2,Really not worth it,"So I bought the swiffer carpet flick cause I have a small kid and there are continuous crumbs and rice and you name it on the carpet near my dining table.Each time I have tried to use this product, the refill gets full in a second and it really doesn't pick up everything so I have to do the hand collection anyway. I mean the idea sounds great but it needed to be way more effective as a product and really why is the refill so small????"
1,"stink, stank, stunk","Save your money and buy a small electric broom or a regular dust mop. This picks up only very very light dust and dirt, not at all what you see on TV. A total waste of my money."
1,swiffer problem-no refills,"I actually liked this product a lot-however be aware that they no longer make the refills. If you like it, buy up a lot of the refills because it's your last chance.Doesn't seem right to continue to sell a product when it won't be usable when the initial run of refills is no longer available."
2,TERRIBLE PRODUCT,This is one terrible product. Very expensive because the little sticky pick up fillers fill up FAST even if you have a clean house. The refills are hard to find. Cute if you want a kid to help you behind your vaccum. Boo I have gave it a 2 because of the exercise you get from having to go over a spot over and over and over. D-
1,This thing is horrible!,This thing is horrible. Cumbersome to use and does nothing. I have to swiffer over and over again and crud is still on the floor. It removes a little bit of dirt but doesn't actually clean a rug/carpet. I'm giving it one star because Amazon won't let me rate it -0.
2,not impressed - not for dog owners,"After i opened the flick and easily assembled it I put it right to use. After a couple of ""sweeps"" I knew I had been suckered. I have 2 dogs and the Flick just pushed the hair into a nice little pile - which was easier for me to pick up than before, but that's not the point. After sweeping my Living room I had pile lines of dog hair everywhere and the cartridge was partially covered in other stuff. It's good to let my son use while I lug out the good ol' vacuum cleaner. It did pick up stuff I didn't think it would, but still not impressed."
2,Good for very small jobs.,I bought this so that it would be easier to clean up after my cats instead of taking out the vaccume every time. It works on small stuff like Cat litter and sometimes on cat food but not on anything bigger than that. Doesn't trap much hair at all. The thing I was dissapointed in was that the catch tray was much too small for the jobs I need to do. My cats spill a fair amount of litter around their boxes and are messy with their food. I have to change the pick up pad once or twice just to clean up all the stuff that ends up on the floor. It's pretty much better just to get out the vaccume and do the job that way. I think they could improve this product by allowing larger items to be caught up in the catch tray and making the catch tray a bit larger.
2,I should have REALLY read the description before ordering.,"This was not what I was expecting. I thought I had ordered a documentary style type video. This was not the case. What I got after I loaded the disc into my DVD player was hours of lecture. Which would be perfect if I were taking a class and needed material for a paper. The videography is amateur (at best) and the lectures are very...very long. This video is for hard core fans of government secrets and or cover ups. If your the type of person who just can't get enough detail on this particular subject, this video is perfect. if you were just looking for some fun, psuedo-documentary video on government secrets or cover ups....keep looking."
1,Don't waist your money.,"Man, when one has a chance to do a good thing and sooooo badly messes it up, what more can I say..."
5,Greatest Film Electrician Guide Ever.,"This book continues to be one of the greatest resources a D.P., Gaffer, Best Boy or Electrician could ever ask for. I continue to read and reread this handbook and learn and understand more and more about film lighting and technique.Whether you are an experienced gaffer or an apprenticing electrician, this book is the first step to gaining a professional knowledge of film lights, distribution and practice!Stephen Q. Breslin"
4,Outstanding,Amazon's order forms are very easy to use. They are very good at keeping you informed on your order status.My package arrived very quickly.Thanks Amazon!
5,Old Friends,"My family has enjoyed this magazine for years. I agree that the solicitations for renewal are overkill and addressed this concern by having my mother's subscription sent to me. The beautiful photography is a joy for Mom now that dementia has limited her ability to read. Other magazines are often tossed in the trash, but Birds and Blooms is enjoyed by three generations until the pages are worn. It's great to have a magazine that focuses on something positive. Birds and Blooms is a feast for the eyes and a celebration of the beauty that surrounds us. It's as if an old friend has stopped in for a visit when Birds and Blooms arrives in the mail."
2,still waiting,Still waiting........not received it yet...why do magazines take so long to get on track in this day of computers.....it makes absolutely no sense....there are no acceptable excuses.
2,Sleazy renewal letters,I bought my mother a 4 year gift subscription and Birds and Blooms keeps sending her renewal letters. I keep telling her not to respond because it's a 4 year subscription and I was going to renew it for her again as a gift but after the tone of the latest letter I'm not going to bother.
4,good; could be better,This is a good addition to our kitchen. The only complaint I have is that oil drips out of the dropper if one is not careful. The hole at the end of the dropper should have been smaller.
4,good overall,"It's small, so on the positive side it uses little space, but on the other the oil needs to be replenished more often.Pros: You don't have to use a separate spoon to measure the amount of oil, nor worry about plastic breakage as much as if it were glass. It's conveniently light.Cons: It's put together in sections and the bottom section on this one is a little chipped. The thin measuring tube drips too much and its rubbery part seems to attract things like hairs to it."
2,not that great,"I bought 2. They both drip horribly but one drips more than the other. They end up getting oily and messy because of the dripping. Also, with measurements, you can't be accurate if you're not quick due to the dripping problem. I have used both the ones I bought with oil. They do look attractive, but as for usefulness, I wish I would have just bought a simple squirt bottle."
4,oil dispenser,This product does everything I wanted it to do.Dispenses just the right amount of oil. Tube also actsas a cap to keep oil fresh.
4,"So far, so good.","I got this for my wife to replace a broken olive oil dispenser. She loves it, though I sensed some concern over its plastic construction and the lack of wash-ability for the baster, though an olive oil container doesn't need washed often. It was reasonably priced and what it lacks in attractiveness it makes up for in convenience and accuracy. The one point of note would be to make sure that you account for the baster when you fill the container--either by adding less or releasing the air before inserting and allowing it to fill with oil. Otherwise, you may encounter a mess (my wife can speak from experience on this)."
5,oil dispenser: fantastic,I bought 9 of these oil dispenser and every time somebody sees it they want to get one too. It's really great to have in the kitchen. I recommend it .Marti Charbonneau from Maine and Quebec
5,Great Book,This is a great book (recommended by my baby's pediatrician)!! I finally am understanding my baby's cries as being overtired/overstimulated and feel better as a mom that I can soothe his crying by following the EASY method!! Thanks!!
5,I love this book!!!,"My daughter had difficulty taking naps. While she slept beautifully at night she took very brief, and infrequent naps during the day. I purchased a number of other books (Baby Wise, Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child and Good Night, Sleep Tight). This book was the one however that turned my daughter around within 2 days. While I continue to use the other books as references (finding Baby Wise book to be the least helpful), I found The Secrets of the Baby Whisperer to be the one that 'clicked' for me. I am so thankful I found it! I have suggested it to other friends who have had similar success. I would strongly recommend this book to anyone looking to help their child find sleep."
4,Grateful for E.A.S.Y.,"It's simple, easy reading. I read it in one night, when my daughter was 3 months old and nowhere near sleeping thru the nite. The advice was clear and direct, but seemed too simple to make a difference. It never occurred to me that we didn't have an eating/sleeping schedule. Within 2 days, we were on a schedule, and I had a couple of hours for myself. Within 2 weeks, she was sleeping thru the nite, without being forced to 'cry it out'. It gives advice about treating your baby with respect during eatings and feeding (ie. giving her your undivided attention during meals, and not playing loud music or turning on bright lights while she's sleeping). Makes sense. The only problem I had with the book was a comment she wrote regarding expressing breastmilk exclusively. She states it can only be done for approximately 5 weeks before the supply dries up. I'm in my 5th month. She should stick to what she knows to be true."
1,Bad for Breastfeeding,"This book advocates breastfeeding on the formula feeding model. Many of the techniques it suggests, such as scheduling feeds and single-sided feeding, will kill the milk supply of a new breastfeeding mother. I know of at least one mother who feels that her loss of a sufficient milk supply was a direct result of following the advice in this book."
2,A several page essay could express the same,"This book was less than ""average"". However, this is a book that I believe to be written for the parents who are in need of immediate assistance in parenting their newborns. The book was a waste of my precious time. As all new parents can relate- they don't have time as they bring their newborns home, experience sleep deprivation, heal from the labor and feed every 2-3 hours. The content in the book was basic common sense or information I had already learned from birth classes offered at my hospital during pregnancy. It was a waste of my time and money to read 276 pages that could have been summarized in a few page essay."
1,Warning - bad advice,"Someone bought me this book and I wish they hadn't wasted their money. Don't buy this book unless you are a Nazi. The breastfeeding advice is terrible and the use of pacifiers appalling. Artificial nipples (pacifiers and bottles etc.) should not be used by breastfed babies until after breastfeeding is well establish (6-8weeks). This is precisely the time when the author WANTS people to use them to ""train"" the baby. Babies need to be breastfed ON DEMAND to build and maintain a good supply of milk. What about letting the baby establish their own ""schedule"" in their own time?"
2,"A few good ideas, but overall, very stressful for this new parent","I was given a copy of this book before the birth of my first child. About 2/3 of the way through the book, I finally had to put it aside because it was stressing me out with all of the things Ms. Hogg considered ""necessary"" in order to have a happy, contented baby. After my son was born, I decided to read it again and found that he didn't fit very neatly into any of her four categories of babies.We tried her EASY technique for the past four months and we're abandoning it now because it isn't working for our son. He likes to eat, then sleep, then play.I also agree that there are several times where the author comes across condescending and like a really bad British sitcom. If you have a low tolerance for being talked at, skip this book."
1,Not for high need baby,"These ideas may work on the angelic baby but they just makes things worse for the high need baby. Much of what is said is counter intuitve and as it turned out for us and our high need baby counter productive. I am sorry I wasted my time reading it, and more sorry for all the weeks I attempted applying the so called EASY methodology. If what she is suggesting does not feel right, it is because it is not right."
1,Opinion dressed up as fact,"The author was a baby nurse (whose own children were tended by someone else) She has advice about everything but little of it is founded on fact -- she actually says that scientific research is ""propaganda"". I was looking for mainly ideas on how to calm my baby and help her sleep better, but mainly found ways to take better care of myself without regard to my baby’s needs, which is an odd approach for a parent to take. I found several books that do a better job of combining research and common sense: The No-Cry Sleep Solution and Our Baby: The First Year."
3,Not Bad...,"Tracy Hogg, nanny-to-the-stars, has a pretty solid philosophy when it comes to babyrearing. I didn't like it at first, but then I started to understand it a little better. She's a bit ethnocentric and sometimes comes across as a little preachy, but this book can be very helpful when you've got a crying child and can't fathom a reason why. More useful for 2-4 month old babies, since it's pretty tough to put a newborn on a routine (they pretty much run the place for the first few weeks). In a nutshell, though, that's what she advocates: get 'em into a regular pattern..."
4,Great Ideas,"This book is a great, middle of the road perspective. I enjoyed her approach to personal temperment and getting to know your baby. This has helped me with my child as well as the other children I am around."
5,I love this book,"I buy this book now for my pregnant friends, I wish I had it when I came home from the hospital. I'm not a big believer in using one person's philosophy or system to raise your child, but sometimes its nice to have some guidelines, suggestions or encouragement. I like this book because its a nice middle-of-the-road attitude. Some reviews said she is judgemental, but I don't feel that's the case. She is saying what's worked for her, and specifically says that if you're doing something else that's working, don't change it. She does include some 'baby types' and general schedules, but states specifically that every baby and family is different and these are just general guidelines. Really, in this book, she presents PATTERNS rather than schedules. Babies like to have predictable days, this shouldn't be a surprise to anyone. With this book you can help yourself see what patterns your baby is trying to set up for himself and help him do so. At least, that's how I used it."
2,little substance,"This book has some good, reasonable advice. It is primarily about how, very generally, to take care of your baby. (It offers little advice for sicknesses, etc.)However, it's not worth buying. It's one of those books where you get the impression that the author had about 10-20 pages worth of stuff to say, but spread it out over a whole book instead. Skim through it in a bookstore rather than buy it."
4,Helpful Tips for bedtime,"Though following through with ALL of the tips that Ms. Hogg suggests in this book just doesn't work with my schedule, I do feel like the information is valid and helpful. If you are having trouble with getting your infant to sleep or keeping her asleep, this book may be of great value to you."
5,This is THE ONE,"With so many parenting books out there, and so many recommendations, I will say just one thing: this is the ONE book that OB/Gyn's and midwives should REQUIRE their expecting mothers to read! After reading this, and experiencing such positive results from it with my own daughter, I feel genuinely sorry for all the babies I see in public with mothers who obviously don't know how to read their babies' cues. This book makes it so easy to understand and to adapt real-life practices that make parenting the absolute joy it should be."
2,Not the best for 1st time parents!,"The realization of motherhood was pretty scary to me. I hardly had any experience with infants and desperately needed some guidance! When I heard of this book, I immediately rushed out to purchase it with the hopes of learning the many aspects of infants' needs and how to basically establish a daily flow to our new lives together. Although some of the basic concepts are helpful, this book did not offer me the overall 'guide' I was in search of in order to establish a daily flow, including feeding and sleeping routines. Instead, I found that the book 'On Becoming Baby Wise' was the exact resource I needed! It is wonderful and has been a lifesaver to me!! Although it is less expensive than 'Secrets of the Baby Whisperer', it is worth far much more!"
2,A lot of contradictory advice.,"Some of the information like what a hungry cry vs. a wet diaper cry was sort of helpful, except that her description of an overtired cry was that same as for hungry and then she talks about how overtired is often misinterpreted for hunger - duh!Also, my son was unable to breastfeed, Tracy Hogg states that it's impossible to pump exclusivly for longer than about 5 weeks - Well, to use her word - Hogwash!!!. I made it to three months with no drop in milk production (mind you I never produced enough for my son to have 100% breastmilk, but I never dried up), but I spent a lot of time up to the 5 week mark stressing about it.Plus, not being able to follow her EASY program, made me feel pretty inept, which as a lot of new parents know, you don't need help to feel like you're not up to the task sometimes :-)"
2,"""Hogg-wash""","My friends and I that read this book all agree... we found her baby descriptions to be ridiculous as it seems that almost every baby will fall into every one of those categories, just depending on the day, hour, minute... I also found some of her assertions ridiculous and completely unrealisitic for infants.. Maybe this book if fine for working with older babies, but I think it falls into the category of one of those books that makes you question yourself and worry that you are ""doing it all wrong""...On the positivie side, some of the ""baby signs"" and what they might mean were helpful and on target for the most part, but the rest of the book I suggest reading with a grain of salt.."
1,Not useful,"Even if you don't disagree with her suggestions, she gives very little useful information for many moms. She might be able to institute her regimen with my baby, but I have no idea how to do it from the information in the book."
5,The best for first baby year,"This book and method was a huge help for us, and advised us on how to keep our schedule and life the way it was. Its suggestions and practices helped us understand our baby's needs and discomforts and since she was 4 months old, our baby had full night sleep! Highly recommended to all beginner parents.We are 15 weeks pregnant now, and we are planing on staring this method on our second baby from day one. It worked for our first one, hoping it will work on the second, since we have a very god example of what our first one turned into ;)"
3,Great resource for new parents,"We purchased this book when our twin daughters were 5 weeks old. My husband read the book cover to cover, while I focused on the portions dealing with sleeping through the night. It was the most I could due in my semi-comatose sleep deprived state. I found the book useful in providing comfort for my anxiousness while giving us great tools to consider implementing in the care of our twins. I don't believe any book is the end-all-be-all so I reviewed the suggestions and tried them and stuck with what worked. I found her insight to be practical and in line with my own philosophy. It was very useful as we prepared to train our babies to sleep through the night. It's good easy reading and provides loads of troubleshooting advice, but like any other advice use what works for you."
4,Did Everything it Promised,"I admit it, the fact that Tracy Hogg's system classifies my daughter as an Angel baby earned this book a few points right off the bat. But there is much more to it than that.At the heart of this book is the E.A.S.Y. method. I can't say enough about this sytem; eat - activity - sleep - you in two to four hour stretches, depending on your baby. Within days of implementing this method, I could read my baby. What does this mean? To all you soon-to-be Mom's, it means consistency and predictability, and those my friends are the keys to sanity. I could plan my day in a way that my baby enjoyed while still meeting the needs of my whole family. I felt much more confident and in control. My husband and I got to concentrate on all the amazing qualities of our daughter, while still having order in our lives (which early on seems like liitle more than the ability to shower and do the laundry).Buy it."
3,Good insights but not for newborns,"There are alot of helpful insights in this book but I don't recommend reading it until your baby is at least 2 months old, and you are more in tune with her needs and personality. I started reading this book as soon as I came home with my daughter and it drove me crazy. Instead of really paying attention to my baby, I was trying to space her feedings (the book says babies should eat every 2 1/2 to 3 hours). Now at 3 months old my baby still breastfeeds a full meal every two hours.Just take this book with a grain of salt, and read other more objective books like ""What to Expect..."". The best parts of the book are on reading your baby's body language, and also the GENERAL routine of E.A.S.Y. : Eat, Activity, Sleep, and You.Don't take the book too seriously like I did."
3,"A good ""synopsis"" of other books","I have found this book to be a cross between Babywise and What to Expect the First Year. The principles introduced are more detailed in other parenting books available so if you think Tracy's ideas are ""novel"" you will get more information from other sources.I had great expectations (and read the book from cover-to-cover) from all the media coverage Ms. Hogg received. When I finally finished I had a ""not-so-satisfied"" feeling. I found the book to be quite average."
3,Sounded great but was hard to implement,I read this book whil pregnant with my first child. I was really encouraged by the EASY plan as it seemed so logical. But trying to implement it was a whole lot harder than I thought. My son wanted to eat every 2 hours and he didn't want to sleep longer than 30 min. I tried the tips in this book but just didn't have much luck.
1,Would Not Recommended it,"This book was not what I hoped it would be. I read the book and tried out her way of getting your baby to sleep and it did not work! It just frustrated me and made me stay up with my child most of the night. She says not to let your baby cry itself to sleep because that's mean to the baby and the baby doesn't deserve it blah blah blah. I let my baby cry through a middle of the night feeding once he was old enough to be sleeping through the night and then the next night all I had to do was put a binkie in his mouth and on the third night he didn't even wake up. My way worked way better than hers. Don't waste your money and buy the book, see if your local library has it if you really want to read it."
1,"Condescending, Opinionated, and Inaccurate","Her tone is opinionated and frustrating. If you disagree with anything she says, you're wrong. Her advice on breastfeeding and the introduction of solid foods contradicts even the AAP's recommendations. She seems to prefer formula-feeding to breastfeeding, and reading her chapter on feeding would surely convince any tired mama to give up on breastfeeding.I've read several baby books, and I find that most of them have some good advice and are worth the read even if I don't agree with everything the author has to say. This book, however, has the potential to HURT rather than HELP struggling parents."
1,please save your pennies!,"I'm usually the sort who thinks if you can't find something positive to say, keep your mouth shut. However, this book and the DVD that I purchased have inspired me to write. Simply put it is indescribably bad. Made me feel a bit ashamed to be British. There's no research behind anything she says and it is repetitive beyond imagination. What were they thinking? I'm glad its made her rich but there are so many better books out there especially if you want to hear advice that is based more on research than one woman's hunch. Eg I loved the DVD of the Happies Baby on the Block. It gave me more than just reading the book as I could observe how to do the swaddling and rocking techniques.Save your pennies for something better than this drivel!"
2,Please...,"Hogg makes some good points in this book, particularly regarding realizing a newborn is a fully sentient being, that it is intelligent, and to treat it with respect. Beyond that, I didn't get much out of this book. Her tone is condescending, and her assertion that you MUST do it her way or you're doing it wrong is ridiculous. Her audience is likely people who really need to understand the balance between intuitively knowing what newborns need, and what regiment they must apply. Sadly, that's the audience that will throw this book out the window because she's so heavy-handed about it."
5,"A baby ""MUST HAVE""","This book is by far one of the things I'm most grateful for receiving before having my first baby. My husband and I both read the book and it's such a wealth of knowledge and tips. It's not an ""extreme"" book but one that has sensible, common sense information that you just don't think about or even realize, before reading, since parenting is such a new and unknown thing at first. Tracy Hogg, the author, is a British lady who has a great sense of humor and writes in a very clear way. The book is very easy to read and doesn't take long to get through at all. We've used this book so many times, even after reading it all the way through, as a resource. I would honestly read this book first and it will be the only book you need to read. Thank you to ""The Baby Whisperer"" for sharing all the great advice, encouragement, and common sense tips to help new parents."
5,Very sound and wise advise for some of very complicated issues.,Very sound and wise advise for some of very complicated issues. My issue was sleeping and it gave step by step instructions of how to get child accustomed to his room and his bed.
2,Yawn,"Rather boring. She says alot of what is common sense to most moms and there are no ""secrets"" to what mother nature gave us. I would not recommend it to friends or family. The one positive - its a really cheap book!"
5,Great book!,"This book is great for new and expectant parents. It covers all the bases. I read it after my 4-month old had developed napping ""issues"" and wished I had read it much earlier in his little life! It would have saved me a lot of crying (both myself and the baby!) It is very informative, easy to read, and has lots of very specific info about baby care (eating, sleeping, caring for the baby, solving problems). I have read tons of baby books and this is one I highly recommend!"
2,She's got to be kidding!,"I read this when I was pregnant and thought it was sound advice, but after I had a baby I realized the book should have been thrown out the window. Maybe British babies and American babies are different or something, but I could never get my baby back to sleep in the middle of the night by patting her on the back. The thing I found was true is the E.A.S.Y routine, which my baby fell into on her own - I didn't make her do it. So, the author acts as thought she invented it or something. I'm sure that many mothers use it like a baby Bible, but I just found it to be ridiculous."
1,Horrible book,"A friend bought me this book because of the good reviews on Amazon, and gave it to me at my baby shower. When my son was born, I tried to follow Tracy Hogg's advice, not knowing any better. It turns out her book was useless for my colicky son. Worse, her advice made him more and more agitated. Desperate for help, I tried many other books (including Dr. Sears' book), and the only one that helped was ""Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child"" by Dr. Weissbluth. Of all the books I tried, it was the only one grounded on actual sleep research. I can't say enough good things about it. Don't waste your money on Tracy Hogg's book."
4,Right to the Point,"I found this book to be very honest and straight to the point. I have used several of the ideas and they have helped so much, especially on breastfeeding. I think this is a book every new mom should have on hand. It does take some disipline, but it is worth the effort to get the end result."
2,Baby may I pick you up?,"This book is completely idiotic. We've neglected to give our son a tour of the house ""and this is the kitchen, we cook here"", nor do we ask his permission before changing his diaper or picking him up from his crib. I'm sure terrible developmental things will happen as a result.The breast feeding advice is wrong, and there seems to be an abdication of parental authority if you follow her advice. Buy Penelope Leach instead."
1,Very disappointing,I was really disappointed in this book. She is very authoritative in her tone but without any scientific backing. I did not agree with most of her opinions especially those that were not supportive of breastfeeding. It's like listening to your English grandma lecture at you on how to raise your child. No thanks.
4,Made me think of The Child Whisperer by Matt Pasquinilli,"This book reminded me of another book with a similar title. The Child Whisperer, by Matt Pasquinilli, talks about how to use simple language and other types of communication to effectively parent young children. Secrets of the Baby Whisperer is a great introduction to the philosophy of changing our thinking about kids."
3,whatever,This book is ok. There are somethings that I can follow and some I can't. I think it is a bit odd this lady wants you to talk to the baby about EVERYTHING. Like when you bring the baby home for the first time she wants you to go in every room and tell the baby what it is and what you do in there. She is just a bit to wacky for me.
2,"bad breastfeeding advice, author is condescending","I read this book cover to cover and I would skip this one! This book is not very supportive of breastfeeding and her advice is terrible - example- She tells her reader that women should wash off their breasts before nursing! the sleep advice is OK, but if you miss the ""window of opportunity"" you are screwed! Following her advice just made us terribly frustrated. Read Weissbluth's ""Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child"" instead- Much better advice, based on science, it works, and the author is not condescending (Luv?? Ducky??)!"
3,"Good advice, but read before you have your baby","This is a great book, filled with tons of excellent advice. However, I read this book when my baby was 3 months old and found that what I had been doing up to that point was all 'wrong' (according to the methods in the book) and it became overwhelming to try to change all the bad habits that were developed in the meantime. Reading this book made me feel like I had been doing a bad job in the first 3 months of my son's life."
5,An Excellent Start to Good Habits,This book was a great help to me as a first time/new mom. I can't begin to see how helpful it was to get the baby into a routine instead of dragging her around and keeping her out to suit my needs. Once you see how happy and rested you can be by following some simple routines it really made a difference. I would highly recommend this book.
5,helpful book,"so far, this book has been pretty helpful, although we have only just started to read through and implement some changes from the book."
3,secrets of a baby whisperer,"This book was for my daughter-in-law so I only read a bit in another store before buying it from you. What I read I liked, and when I asked her if the book was helping her teach her baby to sleep, she said yes."
3,ron_ron_dh,I found this book to have a great deal of helpful information. It did give us a better understanding of infant sleeping habits and personalities.
4,borrowed then bought,"Got this book from the library and then liked it so well, I bought it. Advice is middle of the road - a balance between letting baby rule your life and making sure baby needs are met while still meeting your needs. Haven't had the baby yet to apply the advice to, but the book is easy to follow and it's easy to find topics you need help with. I guess I won't know til later whether the advice really works."
4,I like Baby Whisperer Solves All Your Problems better.,"I ended up only reading parts of this book. To me the Baby Whisperer Solves All Your Problems is easier to navigate and read. It also has a better index. This is more of a novel book than a reference book. I did try to read this after my baby was born, so maybe this book would be better to read before you have a a baby, because you definitely do not have time once the baby arrives!"
2,Kindle version lacking features,"This is a review of the Kindle version of ""Secrets of the Baby Whisperer"". They did a sloppy job of translating this into digital form. I read the book on my iPad and many of the tables/charts were mis-aligned or partitioned over serveral pages so they are impossible to read. Seems like they didn't proof-read the digital version before putting it up for sale.The Kindle version also does not allow you to Loan the book to friends. I didn't notice this before purchasing and it's just another reason why the Kindle version is lacking. Get a hard copy of the book if you plan on using this as a reference book.The book itself was good. I'd give it 4 stars. I didn't agree with everything she said, but I learned a few tips about understanding my baby and his signals. Much of her advice is intuitive so it gives you confidence and tips which you can use to follow your own instincts. She has some helpful appendix tables with information on baby development and feeding."
4,Very reassuring,This book helped a lot with recognising that babies aren't always hungry but can be bored/tired etc too. I liked the section on body language for babies. V useful
5,Great book - highly recommended,"I bought this book after giving birth to my second child. It was a life-saver! Even though it was tough at first to implement Tracy Bogg's ideas (especially getting the baby to fall asleep without a crutch such as swing), it was definitely worth it once I got it to work. It also gave me some ""me"" time. To this day, my second child is a very solid sleeper and falls asleep easily. My only regret is not reading it earlier. I would highly recommend it to others."
5,Secrets of the Baby Whisperer,I bought this book when my baby was 3 months old and I didn't think I could survive another month. I was exhausted from carrying my dear son around all day and not getting any sleep. The Baby Whisperer is the only book I could find that gave me real answers on how to help my son get what he needed to be happy. Not just vague ideas like let him cry it out- the author is not for that but how to kindly help your baby sleep in his crib and also be on a schedule so you can better interpret his needs. The Baby Whisperer helped me enjoy my baby more and made us both much happier.
1,"Disappointing, save your money!","After seeing Tracey Hogg on Dateline I recommended her book to my friend, a new mother who'd been having trouble getting her baby to sleep. We found this book simplistic and superficial, not helpful at all. We were also disappointed that Hogg's only reference to circumcision was her advise on caring for the wounded penis. For someone who claims to be so sensitive to babies feelings and an advocate for children, we found her to be neither. Save your money. If you must satisfy your curiosity go to the library, or the used book store where it's certain to be available soon at a dramatically reduced price."
1,"Oh, it's just great...","If you are planning to enroll your chlid in some sort of boot camp as soon as he is old enough to march!I believe women intuitively know how to care for their babies, and books like this undermine their confidence and make them feel inadequate. Ladies, you know what works for your kids. You don't need some baby trainer telling you how to make your baby sleep, eat, play, poop, and breathe according to an arbitrary schedule.So much of what Ms. Hogg advocates feels ""wrong"" to me - and her assertation that you need to ""promote his independence"" from DAY ONE makes me want to vomit. It's a baby, for goodness sake."
1,Please don't follow the sleeping/ feeding schedule,"New borns should NOT be put on a sleeping/feeding schedule, as this book suggests. Many babies are being admitted to the emergency room for dehydration, because parents are following this advice and let their babies oversleep and postpone feeding. New borns cannot wake themselves all the time, thus miss important meals. I understand the publisher will not print this book again."
3,Beware if breastfeeding!!!,"This book is full of pretty good advice...except for the breastfeeding advice. I have known 3 women (myself included) who had children that didn't gain enough weight by breastfeeding every 3 hours as recommended in the EASY plan. This led 2 of us to stop breastfeeding earlier than we wanted when the doctor said that our kids had ""failure to thrive"" and recommended supplementing with formula. The third was able to get her milk supply back up eventually. I think much of the advice is useful specifically the advice to calm down and take a moment to really try to observe and understand what is going on with your baby before you respond. I also think the sleep advice (ritual and routine) is really helpful. I think the tone of the book is a bit condescending and self righteous. Don't read it if you are the type to second guess yourself."
3,2nd book is better,"Tracy's second book is better as a resource. Skip this one if you don't have it yet, and just get her 2nd book."
2,Another great idea,"Based on the reviews I read, a GREAT companion to this book is ""On Becoming Baby Wise,"" by Gary Ezzo and Robert Bucknam. That book was my bible during my first six months as a new mom. If you buy this book, be sure to balance it with the fundamentals presented in Baby Wise. My child is an angel, and people say we're just lucky - but I know it's because we're Baby Wise."
5,Really helpful for new parents!,"I got this book after I had bought her other book ""The Baby Whisperer Solves All Your Problems"". This book explains the EASY routine in a bit better detail, but I found that I really needed both of her books to answer the various questions I had. I found her books the most helpful, more so than the other books I bought (Contented LIttle Baby, What to Expect the First Year, Happiest Baby on the Block, and Healthy Sleep Habits). While I haven't stictly adhered to her routines, I have been able to use them as a guideline and they really helped to get some organization back into my life. Definitely recommend this for all new parents (or ones who don't want to make the same mistakes the second time around)."
1,Be careful!,"A warning to brand new parents: take this book with a HUGE grain of salt! I had a chance to read this book before its publication, when my son was 3 months old, and it caused me many days of anxiety and frustration. The author's contention that all babies fit into one of four types, and that they can all be ""tamed"" by following her recommendations, is just not accurate. My baby didn't nap well, and he certainly needed to eat more than every 3 hours, and I thought one of us must be crazy. Well, now he naps like an angel, and acts like one, too, but not until he was 6 months old. I tried and tried to follow Hogg's advice, causing tears for both of us. Guess what, Tracy? Usually a parent's instincts are right! Maybe your Hollywood parents just don't have any..."
1,Not worth reading,"I wish I read negative reviews on this book more careful before buying it.I might have got couple of useful ideas from it, I still need to see if they prove to be useful, other than that it is been waste of time and money.The tone of the book is annoyingly condescending. The author seems to be not very well educated but irritatingly opinionated on all matters. When you should feed your baby, how much, how long. Her division of babies by temperament into four groups is very primitive and not helpful to anything."
1,Thumbs Down!,"I am a mother of a 5 month old and read this book when my baby was 3 weeks old. I wish I would have never read this book. It has some good hints but her ""E.A.S.Y."" program is absolutely ridiculous for babies under 3 months old. Babies under that age do NOT need a schedule. They need to be fed on demand. A baby should never have to wait 2 1/2 to 3 hours between feedings which is according to her the amount of time a baby can hold out just to stay on her silly schedule. Mothers listen to you heart and maternal instincts. This book makes you go against them. For example she suggests not nursing your baby to sleep for naps or bedtime. How ridiulous! Nursing your baby was designed specifically for these times. Ever since I went off her scheduled program my baby has cut his crying down by 90% (especially around nap and bedtimes).I suggest reading the book for some hints about infant massage and such but if you pass this book over it would be no tragedy."
4,Flexible routine a helpful approach,"I've been very helped by this book -- love the emphasis on respecting your baby and learning how to interpret her cries, sounds and other cues. Hogg recommends a consistent routine of Eat, Activity, Sleep, You (your time to rest or get things done) and has chapters giving helpful advice and tips for each phase of the cycle (although I disagreed with much of her thoughts on breast feeding versus formula). My baby has thrived on having a routine, and I've been helped by knowing where we are in the cycle. Her ""flexible routine"" doesn't take all the guesswork out of parenting, but it makes caring for baby a lot less stressful. Her discussion of different baby types are helpful too. Some friends who have a baby who cries a lot were encouraged by the idea that their baby was ""Spirited"" (one of Hogg's categories) versus ""colicky"" or ""finnicky"" or ""difficult."" Definitely worth the purchase price."
5,This book helps me understand what my baby needs,"I just simply love this book. It gave me a very good idea what my baby needs from me. When I need to calm my baby, I mainly use techniques from ""The Happiest Baby on the Block"". But when I try to figure out what parenting style is the best for my baby, I always use ideas from this ""Baby Whisperer"" book.I read some negative comments from other reviewers. One thing I want to point out is, Tracy is NOT trying to list/compare all possible parenting methodS in the book. She is trying to tell us what she believes and how SHE handles babies from her experience, the ways that work for her. If you think other approaches work better for your kid, go ahead. After all, every baby is unique.But I'm telling you, I have a 20 days old baby in my arm now, and I think I understand my baby very well thanks to this Baby Whisperer book."
1,Is this an infomercial or a book?,"Tracy Hogg is a gifted sales woman, for sure. She sells herself and her method constantly throughout the book. I tired of wading through the egotistical self-congratulations spewed on almost every page. Overall, I found this book lacking substance."
3,Good Book for Establishing Sleep Routine,"""If you follow a structured routine, you will solve all your baby problems"" is the idea of this book.The routine explained in the book is called E.A.S.Y. (Eating, Activity, Sleeping, You). The author explains that the times of the individual elements of the routine will vary according to the baby, but every baby should have a routine if you want to have a life. Eating, Activity, Sleeping and Making Time for yourself are very well explained in the book in an easy-to-read way.If you are breastfeeding, you may not feel any support reading this book, and I can even say that you may get discouraged reading some sections. Although I do not agree with the author's ideas on feeding, I would recommend this book if you are looking to establish sleep routines for your baby. I would not use this book as my only source of information on topics mentioned in the book."
2,Don't miss out...,"Don't miss out on a lot of wonderful experiences with your baby! You will if you take Tracy Hogg's advice.As a reviewer mentioned earlier, Hogg is dead-set against swings and bouncy chairs, and she also advocates that you not let baby fall asleep on your chest. This is one the most treasured moments in early motherhood! I had such comfort and joy when my baby fell asleep on my chest.As a first-time mom, I read this book and was really depressed the rest of the day as I thought everything I was doing was wrong, according to Hogg. While you can pick up some tidbits from the book, I have a tough time recommending it to new moms."
1,Dangerously wrong when it comes to breastfeeding,"It's worth noting that the American Academy of Pediatricians disagrees with much of what Ms. Hogg states in this book - specifically, she feels that babies shoud not be fed on demand, that formula is just as good as breastmilk, and that breastfeeding past 6 months is usually for the mom and not for the baby.I received this book as a gift - and I found it worthless. Don't bother. Dr. Sears' The Baby Book is a MUCH better resource, and is better respected. I also disagreed completely with her ideas about a schedule (ha!) for a newborn, co-sleeping, and attachment parenting."
2,"Some Useful Bits....But Too Much Condescension, Luv","The EASY plan has actually worked quite well for my 10 week old son, so far. I think, perhaps, this is because he tends to get hungry every three hours, so the routine fits in with what he would normally do anyway.What I really could not bear is Hogg's tone. She uses some of the most patronizing language I've read in any parenting book (i.e. ""that dreadful swing""). Her anecdotes seemed contrived, if not completely fictional. They're more self-congratulatory than anything else, allowing her to demonstrate time and again that these poor lost parents would simply continue down the road to domestic failure if she hadn't appeared.A friend had recommended ""The Happiest Baby on the Block"" by Dr. Harvey Karp and I found this truly essential in calming the baby during his first weeks. To his her own, I guess...but I can't recommend Hogg...too much ego."
2,Be Informed,"Be sure to read at least 20 reviews before you make a decision about this book. The first few are very positive reviews. However, if you take the time to read more you will find that the author's audience is EXTREMELY polarized. Some love the book and others hate it. Be informed."
1,FAKE,"I love this book and Tracy's style, this is by far the best book out there for a new mom... which is why I wanted to purchase it as a gift for my newly pregnant friend... it's a rip off! fake! it's like they made copies of the original book and put it together themselves, pages were uneven and the book is half the size of the original book you would actually purchase from a book store! DO NOT BY THIS BOOK FROM THIS COMPANY! FInd the real deal."
4,"Straight forward, common sense approach to parenting","As you read this book you may think to yourself ""that totally makes sense!"" Nothing in this book is rocket science but it is crucial to read as it's basically things you should be thinking and the way you should approach caring for a baby - but it is so simple and common sense that many people may overlook these points.In all, it's a great reminder that everyone struggles at first, but that caring for a small child can be a very positive experience. You are reminded to not get overwhelmed and that every parent struggles with these issues especially in the beginning. I thought it was very helpful and would recommend to anyone expecting a child."
5,Would recommend for any new or expecting parent,I love this book! It gave concrete structures for helping your baby get on a schedule and helps you get to know your baby and their unique cries.
5,Helpful,"I found this book to be very helpful and purchased it on a friend's recommendation. I picked it up after our newborn was a couple of months old and wish that I would have read it before the baby came. I thought there were several good tips in this book that I would have implemented sooner, had I read it earlier."
3,No details ( especially for helping baby sleep)!,"I read this book over and over, before my baby was born and many times over the first few months I was dealing with my colicky newborn. While the BW ( what we call her in our house)offers great general advice for taking care of babies you might as well chuck it aside of you are already in deep with sleep problems! I swear I followed all her advice!! But, it just does not offer details. Friends agree. I finally ditched my well worn copy at 6 months and solved my babies terrible sleep problems quickly with ""Healthy sleep,...."" .A good read full of general advice, but won't solve sleep problems. Move on."
3,"Helped, but also stressed me out!","I was really looking forward to reading this book after my baby was born and figuring out what he was trying to tell me. I heard good things about it from reviews and friends. I imagined tuning into his secret language and helping him become a happy little baby b/c mommy knew what he needed. While I did accomplish some of this--the pattern of E.A.S.Y. (eating, activity, sleeping) helped me understand SOMETIMES what might be wrong--I gave up trying to put him on a schedule like Hogg suggests. I kept a journal, looked for his pattern, established rituals for bedtime, naptime, eating. But in the end, I've given up because it stressed me to try to impose a schedule on him rather than cuddle him, fall asleep with him on my chest, give him a pacifier, or do whatever else seems right at the time. So, take this book with a grain of salt--use what you can, don't use what doesn't work, and don't stress about it."
1,"This woman will never ""Whisper"" to my baby","This book is so ridiculous I couln't even finish it. She says that she is a lactation consultant, however she does not advocate for breast feeding. She made a stronger case for bottle feeding, which has been shown to be inferior to breastfeeding in almost every way. Don't buy this book, don't read this book. This lady is not a baby whisperer!"
2,Another British Know-It-All,"I'm sorry. I heard all the reviews about this book and thought I'd give it a try. One question I have is, ""Why do british women think American women are helpless twits?"". Not to be harsh, as I'm not that type, i am very disappointed with this book. Seriously, do you really expect me to ask my 4 month old for her permission in order to pick her up? To me, her reaching her arms up to me is permission enough. I actually ran a dialogue like the author suggested when I was changing my daughter's diaper in a british accent ""Oh is okay with you that I take your pants off? Are you sure? Is it alright that I undo your ""nappy"" now? Shall I do the right flap first, or the left? Oh please, you just let me know if I'm disrespecting you in anyway?"" Needless to say, my daughter giggled throught the diaper change, and I realized I wasted my money."
2,Borrow this one from the library,"Did I skip a chapter? I have read several books on getting my baby to sleep through the night, & I'm still looking for the answer. I even had my mom stay with him for a week to comfort him through the nights (she really IS a baby whisperer) yet he still wakes up on schedule- 3 hours- for his feeding. After learning his cues, I know he's definetly hungry. I don't feel Tracy addressed the real issues that my friends and I have, instead, covered topics like nursing too long (an hour) or trying to put him down with loud music. Duh! She doesn't come right out and say it, but I believe she must let the babies cry it out as long as there obvious needs are met. To her credit, she was entertaining & had several ideas worth reading, such as her chapter on body language and cues. I loved her advice to treat your baby like a little human being. My son was already on her EASY schedule after reading 'Babywise'. Tracy, come to my house and see if you can whisper my son to sleep."
5,Secrets of the Baby Whisperer,"I purchased two copies. One, I gave to new parents. The other, I kept for myself. I have a grandchild arriving soon and need a 'refresher' course.Plus, new information re: infant care, is very important to me!!"
1,Less than one star?,If you would like to read a book based on absolutely no research or methodology than this is the book for you.... Do yourself a huge favor and don't bother as it is not worth the paper it is printed on. There are many other books on the market that at least provide information based on research.
4,A good guideline for new parents.,"I enjoyed reading this book that gave me some guidelines on how to understand my new baby when she comes in March 2005. However, I did noticed that I started to feel stressed out when I was reading it because I was taking too much information in me all at once. I realized that I don't need to follow every word that author has said in the book and learn to use my gut feelings.I definitely agreed with Tracy that babies need routines in their home to help feel secure in their new life. I know it doesn't only apply to babies, but to the whole family as well. A well structure family with a strong foundation tend to come from a family who have routines in their home. I have heard and read so much how researchers and church explaining that families need to set their home in order to have a well secure family.Tracy gave wonderful guidelines on how to set a routine for infants to help them feel secure in their new home and to help parents start off at the right foot."
1,Mom knows best,"This isn't a great book. Perhaps some of the techniques will help a few mothers whose children are receptive to them but they didn't work at our house. This was the first and last childcare book I've purchased. I did learn something important by reading it: I know what's best for my baby and I don't need books and overrated authors telling me otherwise. My son is now 16-months old and I think we've done well without the help of child ""experts."" My mom, the pediatrician and my instincts are the best resources I have and the only ones I need."
1,doesn't even desreve a star,"This book is a danger to your baby's health and well being. I read the book because the title caught my eye. I have read reports that this book and Ezzo's Babywise have been directly linked to failure to thrive infants. With books like this out on the market, I am going to encourage my kids to be pyschotherapists so they can take care of all the unfortunate adults who were raised on this style of irreverent parenting."
3,"Some good ideas, but not for twins","This book had some good tips for maybe first time parents. However, I have twins and I can tell quite obviously that the author never did. I would not recommend the twin advice, it will have you doing nothing but caring for your multiples all day and night on a staggered schedule. BAD IDEA, I would do the opposite and do everything at the same time. Anyway, It does give good general info for people who don't know much about babies. But I sold my copy on Ebay b/c I have no desire to use it for my next baby. A lot of things in it just weren't practical with my twins."
5,What a difference this book has made!,"I bought ordered this book a few days ago and I cannot believe what a difference it has made in our lives already. I was totally missing my baby's cues for sleep and she was always cranky. After applying E.A.S.Y. for just two days, I know when she wants to nap and now she eats(breastfeeds) every 3 to 3 1/2 hours, whereas before I always thought she was hungry. It's like having a new baby! times a day. I would reccomend this book to every new or expecting mother!P.S. I wish I had this book 6 months ago!"
1,Good info about baby massage...that's about it.,"I like the information about baby massage. But other than that??? This book made me feel like an utter failure as a new mother. My son doesn't fit in ANY of her categories for babies and I am with the other reviewers who don't agree with her dislike of 'attachment parenting'. I love my son and I relish every moment of my time with him. If cuddling him before he goes to sleep is bad, then I'll be 'bad'. I'm sorry, but this woman needs to get off her high horse and come to grips with reality. Babies aren't going to go to sleep by telling them, ""I'm putting you down for a sleep. You know how much better you feel afterward."" PLEASE! Don't waste your time with this book."
5,A True Lifechanger...,"I cannot praise this book enough. I had no help and was doing it all wrong for 3 months, setting myself up for failure. I was letting my child sleep in a swing all day and with a feeding at night. If I had not read this book right at the 3 month mark, I would have been in for a world of hurt. My son did not know how to put himself to sleep, something I didn't even know should be done. The EASY system that she describes is the best way to raise your child without using harsh, ""cry-it-out"" tactics. I love her and her book, and will be forever grateful."
2,No answers for better SLEEP,"I had heard that this was a good book to find out how to get your baby to sleep through the night, but it really isn't about sleep at all - just a few pages. As a mother of three, much of the rest was common sense, although sometimes too much so: very much the author's opinions (not always meshing with mine). I don't like that she presents herself as against breastfeeding, having choice is good but discounting science (which she does repeatedly) to justify choice is not. If you are looking for a book on SLEEP though, try The No-Cry Sleep Solution: Gentle Ways to Help Your Baby Sleep Through the Night"
1,Perfect gift for person with new puppy,"I am a mom of four children aged 15, 9, 6, and 4 years. I was asked to purchase this for a new mom baby shower gift. Before gifting to the new mommy, I took a look and got sucked in to finish reading. I was astounded at some of the advice given. Only would be useful if you want to train up your baby in the way you might train a puppy, then this is the one for you. This is not a good gift for a person interested in gentle parenting or someone having their first child. I suggest a more rounded parenting guide such as one by Sears or Brazelton. A baby is not a Pup to housebreak and fit into your routine. Your life will change when you have kids and your routine will change too. This book gives the unrealistic expectation that you can somehow mold your baby's personality into your lifestyle by following her schedule. Before buying, take a look at the other parenting top sellers out there."
1,Mama knows BETTER than this,"New moms and dads, beware! This popular book (author is currently making the rounds of TV and radio) is in the ""read this book and fix everything"" category. It's simplistic, and does real harm to those who want to respond to their babies in the most loving, natural ways. Babies come with pretty clear signals, and moms come with the equipment to feed and nurture them. We just have to feel empowered to do so, a response which the author interferes with through schedules, categories, and an overall focus on adults rather than babies. Take a look at Meredith Small's ""Our Babies, Ourselves"" for a parenting style which takes into account the needs of babies for a close, ""entwined"" relationship with their caregivers. Its far more helpful for anyone who truly wants to know what their baby is telling them."
1,This book made me angry!,"My doctor lent me this book to read when I was having problems getting my 3 month old to sleep. I have switched doctors since then. The author is know-it-all, condescending and very annoying in her book. Her opinion on breastfeeding is a joke. She obviously did not breastfeed her babies very long and is one of those people who thinks formula is just as good despite all of the scientific research to support breastfeeding. She believes that there is something wrong with a mother who breastfeeds past a year. She actually had the nerve to write that she thinks a mother who breastfeeds past a year does it because she secretly enjoys being the only one who can calm the baby. Ridiculous! I hated this book! It is a detriment to new parents and babies! Don't buy it!"
2,Generally bad advice,"I read this book when I was pregnant with my now 3-year old son. Before he was born, this book sounded nice. I liked the EASY schedule and some of her advice, related to sleep and feeding. Once he was born, I realized how out of touch this woman is. At first I was frustrated with my son because I tried to implement some of her EASY stuff but it just didn't fit. EASY did not work at all for my son or for anyone else I know. My son needed to be nursed constantly at first, which I get the sense Hogg would not support. Most of her breastfeeding advice is totally bunk - like wiping off your nipples after feeding? Huh? I think a lot of these types of books actually make mothers more insecure and frustrated because moms think their babies should fit nicely into these schedules and patterns but every baby is different and imposing bad advice from a supposed ""nanny"" on them just makes us all crazy."
1,"To me, this book was useless. Read Babywise!!","My son did not respond to this program at all. I will say I know of other babies who have, but even they are still not guarenteed nappers or full night sleepers. On Babywise, my son was sleeping 7 hours a night after the first three days and now, at 11 weeks, he is sleeping 10! As a first time mom, I relied heavily upon Babywise and it DID work. Our son is very healthy (95 percentile in all areas) and is definitely thriving...."
2,Not helpful for this mom,"I'll be honest and admit that I only read the sleep section of this book. I read it twice through and honestly it's just not a method that I want to implement with my child. Also, it gives suggestions but no additional information if her suggestions don't work such as...""give the baby a 10 or 11 pm feeding so they'll continue sleeping"" didn't work for me, my child still woke up at her normal times for feedings. Also the author suggests weaning them from that feeding and offering a pacifier and eventually weaning the pacifier. Well, didn't work once again and she didn't offer any suggestions on what to do if it doesn't work. As with any book you have to do what works for you and your baby and tweak the suggestions but I didn't find this book helpful in any way shape or form. Good luck!"
4,great ideas,"This book gave us great ideas - the best being to wake baby for a feeding before you go to bed for the night. Our six month old is now sleeping through the night thanks to some of the tricks in this book. I don't agree with everything the book says, but it is nice to get many different ideas and use what works for you!"
1,I feel terrible,"My 3 month old baby is not sleeping well, and getting overstimulated easily and instead of getting support and help from this expert, I ended up feeling terribly guilty for not being able to read my baby correctly. Babywise is a much better book to read for assistance. This book made me feel so bad that I returned it."
5,A wonderful and enlightening book!,"Secrets of the Baby Whisperer is a book all new parents should have. If you don't get anything else out of the book, you should get the fact that your new baby is already a person and deserves respect along with patience and love. We were very lucky in the fact that our baby is close to an ""angel"" baby but this book helped me to have a more relaxed attitude towards caring for my child. That attitude may have helped her to be more content. I love how practical Tracy Hogg is and her theories are very down to earth and easy to follow. On a personal note, I wish there was a little more on going back to work, but that was not the focus of the book!"
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!,"As if being a new parent isn't intimidating enough, Ms. Hogg compounds the fear and insecurities tenfold!!! I started reading this book with an open mind, as it had been highly recommended by a friend. By the end of the book, I suddenly felt as if everything that I was doing was wrong. All that I had ever read, all the advice I'd ever been given, and my own insticts were contradicted by her ""theories."" If you want a book to help you as a new parent... this is NOT it!!! (...)"
5,This book is a jewel,"This book is a jewel. I recommend it for both first time parents and for experienced parents. I bought it when I was about to have my second child and it helped a lot. Even though it is mostly common sense advice, well, parenthood deprives us of our common sense sometimes. Hogg's book is witty, funny, full of information and super easy to read."
1,"Shame On the ""Baby Whisperer""","This book is a total sham! I tried the techniques for getting my baby to sleep through the night, and they do not work. (And my baby is in the Angel category!) This book exploits a new mother's desperation to get some rest to create sales. I am returning this book, it's not worth the paper it was written on. I would have given the book negative stars, but was not able to."
2,Nice but not helpful,"Bought this book like a lot of new moms, hoping for some help with sleep issues in my 4 month old. While a lot of what she said was helpful and interesting, there were no actual tips or methods for helping your child learn to sleep better. So frustrating to me as all I wanted was some help, not just talk. Seems the Baby Whisperer forgot to actually include any secrets in her book."
1,Parenting with your head and not your heart,"Tracy Hogg, the author, left her two young daughters to be raised by her mother in England when she moved to the United States. That says it all. This book is more about science than love. She has some good ideas, but the presentation is too negative. It's not accidental parenting, it's called LOVE!"
2,Stressful,"This book made the stresses of being a new parent even worse. Its harsh advice made us feel like we were spoiling our newborn and added guilt each time we snuggled with him or let him nurse a little long. It went against all other advice and books we read about when to introduce a pacifier or bottle, which confused us and again added stress of ""who do we listen to?!""'. These methods may work, but there must be a more gentle way..."
3,Interesting,I liked some of her ideas especially the ideas that babies have different types of cries. I also liked how she showed that babies display different body language to get each one of their needs met. It was insightful at times. Of course there are things that I don't agree with but it's always good to have different ideas and perspectives on things. It gave me more ideas on how to get to know my baby better and how to observe her and better meet her needs.
5,SECRETS TO SANITY!!!!,A very easy read. Helps get things on track so your baby fits into your life. Very helpful in understanding baby body language and crying. Gives all the information you need to get your life back!
4,Helpful information for a first time mom,"I got this book in desperation, seeking advice on handling my crying/screaming newborn. I will say that I still have a crying/screaming newborn. BUT, with some of the tools in here, I feel like I'm better equipped to handle him. There is a chart of signals a baby will give & what these mean, which I found helpful as I think I was misinterpreting some of his cues as being hungry. I also liked the explanations of setting a schedule and giving a bath, as well as how to approach your newborn (taking your time vs rushing).I didn't mark this down a star for my baby still crying because, well, I didn't expect a miracle. BUT, what I do wish the author would address more is how to handle taking your baby to daycare. The examples in this book were entirely stay at home moms or people who didn't go back to work for an extended period of time. For a lot of us working mommas, we have a pretty short time home before returning to work."
3,Worth reading,"This book is ok. I bought it because my 2 month old wasn't sleeping a wink during the day, and it was driving both of us bonkers. Although it has some good advice, and idealistically her ""EASY"" approach (eat, activity, sleep, you) is an excellent idea, it just didn't translate well into real-life, for me anyway. For example, my daughter always got really sleepy after eating and I didn't want to fight her natural inclinations. So I kinda switched it to ""ESYA,"" but she still didn't get much ""sleep"" so I didn't get much ""you,"" aka ""me"" time, which all new moms know is important, even if it's just 15 minutes a day. It did help us to get some kind of structure, and nobody expects total structure (or anything close to it) in those early months anyway. I think it was still worth reading, and since every baby is different it might be perfect for you."
3,"Some good advice, some bad advice","Like many books you need to sort through this and take from it the ideas that appeal to you and discard the rest. There are some good tips in here, but there is also quite a bit of misinformation. I would recommend that you purchase other books on the topics you are interested in to find a balance. Some good ones are: The No-Cry Sleep Solution and The Happiest Baby on the Block."
5,I followed this book to a T and ....,"I cannot say enough good things about Tracy and the Baby Whisperer books. I read quite a few popular books while pregnant and have been meaning to write this review for a while, as my son is almost 5 months old. I followed her advice since bringing him home as I tend to need a little structure in my own life and felt I needed a little help. Her common sense guide gave me confidence that I was doing a good job, like a friend to rely on with consistent advice that always proved true. To this day I do not know if we have an easy baby, or if he is easy because I followed her advice. He is sleeping 12 hours by 4 months and is always well rested because I followed her ""loose schedule"" and advice. I think this is a must for anyone who wants help and who likes the idea of a routine, but always reading baby's cues, not a strict schedule."
4,Very helpful,I learned a lot from this book and my baby is doing much better with her naps and her nighttime sleep. It helped me get her on a routine and to know when she is crying because of being overtired. I would recommend it to new mothers! We started it at 3 months old.
3,I wish I had had this book while I was pregnant,"I thought this book was very good. It helped us to get our baby on a schedual and therefore made our lives slightly more sane. Our daughter is 10 weeks old and slept throught the night when she was 5 weeks old. I use this book and the book ""On Becoming Babywise"" as references. Both have the same ideas as far as getting them on a schedual. ""Secrets of the Baby Whisperer"" says to go to the baby whenever she cries. ""On Becoming Babywise"" says to let them cry it out. I think there needs to be a happy medium between the two. That is why I say I use them both. Bot agree that the baby should feed, play and then sleep. Neither tells what you are supposed to do if the baby falls asleep after a feed and you cannot get her to wake up."
1,Disgusting,The back of the book says it all. All of the reviewers are celebrities. Her section on breast or bottle should be abolished. Has she read any research on the benefits of breastfeeding? Makes me wonder if she is paid by the formula companies. Any person with sense should notice that she does not have any evidence or research to back up her claims. Do not buy this book for a new mother. Babies on schedules? She is just a LA person trying to become famous. I don't think she has any qualifications to write a baby book that could have a negative influence on parents and babies.
1,Was given this book as a gift-would never have bought it!,"My well meaning mother sent me this book as a baby present (I am currently in the sixth month of my pregnancy)saying, ""this is all the rage now...."" It only took me a few pages to realize that the reason she identified with the philosophy of the book is that it certainly WAS ""all the rage"" maybe 40 years ago! I only read a few pages and put the book down-completely turned off by the author's attitude and approach. The only good idea that I noted (in my opinion) was her suggestion to talk to the infant as a person and explain things as you go along, but that seems to me a natural thing and more common sense than something I would need a book to tell me. I am glad I read books by more highly credentialed authors first before seeing this one as they gave me the perspective to pick up on the author's potentially harmful information. It is clear that she carved out a market for herself by playing on new parents fears."
1,Waste of Money,All the ideas presented can be chalked up to common sense. Spend the money on diapers instead.
1,C.R.A.P.,"This book and Hogg's parenting philosophies if anything induces stress and guilt in new moms. Some of it isn't even really logical. Five archetypes of babies? Take your new baby on a tour of your home? And her foolproof E.A.S.Y.? Jeez! IF it only were as easy as she claims it could be. I didn't like her condescending tone in her anecdotes about parents that can't or don't embrace her ""E.A.S.Y."" plan. Parenting by acronyms--rubbish!"
1,Only suitable for normal healthy babies,"This book is good for parents who have trouble free babies. Otherwise, it's a complete waste of money. My baby has acid reflux and colic and none of the tricks that this book talks are suitable."
3,"Great book, but...","I love her method. This is actually a good book.However, anyone who REALLY needs this book probably won't have enough time to really read this whole book in a decent amount of time.It's long, drawn out, and isn't easy to navigate. It takes forever to get to the point... but it has good points.The No Cry Sleep Solution is much better for those who don't have many peaceful hours to finish reading this one.But, if you were to read this book BEFORE there was a problem, it would be really great."
3,Has some useful information but there are better books,"I bought this book when I was still pregnant and read it cover to cover. The casual tone was a bit too much for me at times but over all, I found it interesting. However, there wasn't much that was new to me. And, there were some things I thought that were a bit over the top such as walking your newborn through the house ""introducing"" it to the rooms and furniture. I bought several books and this one was in the middle of the pack as far as usefulness. I got much more out of 12 Hours Sleep by 12 Weeks Old and Babywise than I did out of this. That's not to say it's useless. There were things I picked up and have used. But, I wouldn't recommend this be the first, or only, book you buy."
5,best book,i buy this book for all my friends who are having babies. this book is just incredible. i followed it and my daughter slept through the night at six weeks. i couldn't have been more pleased. too bad i didn't have it when my son was born....WORTH EVERY CENT!!!!
2,"Some good, some just plain odd, advice","This book came highly recommended to me, but I must admit I found it odd and inconsitent. The author is against nursing your baby to sleep (not an uncommon piece of advice) but advises *holding the baby's mouth shut* to discourage him. If that isn't the most bizarre thing I've read in a baby book, I don't know what is. On the positive side, she gives some interesting tips about reading your babies moods and trying to figure out what s/he really needs. Before buying this one, I'd check it out from the library to see if there's something worthwhile in it for you."
5,Thank you Tracy!,"A wonderful and informative book by an author who truly seems to understand babys. After reading her book, we feel we have a better understanding of how to ""listen"" and respond to our 2 month old's needs. Tracy's routines and techniques were easy to follow and implement. Prior to reading Tracy's book, we were struggling with our child's sleep deprivation and unwillingness to sleep in her crib. After following Tracy's E.A.S.Y. routine and applying a few of her calming techniques, our daughter has developed much better sleep habits and is sleeping in her crib after only a few days. Our sanity has been restored. This book is highly recommended by this reader!!!"
5,Great for New Moms,"This book was recommended to me 2 weeks after the birth of my first child. I was a mess and didn't know how to understand my new baby. I read it during my down time (nursing) and was able to make a whole lot of sense of this new little one, and what I needed to do to regain my sanity. I wish I'd read it before he was born. I learned how to understand his cues, how to put him on a regular schedule, and how to plan time for myself so I could feel like a normal person again. I get this book for all of my friends/family who are expecting."
4,Calm,Black books inspired me to get this book. Some stuff it says actually makes you more calm. Its worth the money.
1,Libro No Recibido,"Sincerely,I would report that to date have not received the book ""Making Innovation Work"", I have tried to communicate with the distributor I-Parcel by email but not receive a response from them, I hope to get help from your Part 2 months since purchased the book.Stay alert to your information as soon as possible,Thanks,Andrea Ochoa MarulandaPereira - Colombia"
2,DISAPPOINTING REHASH,"This book was a major disappointment. I wanted details on a fiancee visa, and the subsequent follow-up, and it had virtually nothing on the subject. It just repeats what you would find in the forms you get from the INS. Also, the stuffy-stilted-boring writing style was all too similar to that of the INS bureaucrats, whereas I would give anything to feel that a real live human is talking to me, one who has actually been through the process, not someone who just studied the forms. The only reason I even give it two stars is that it does offer forms and an overview that may be useful for someone who is just beginning the process; othewise, I would call it superficial."
4,Basicly good anime action.,"If you like cute anime babes in giant robots, and the occasional nude scene. Then you'll love this movie and the two others in the series."
4,Jazz...A modern Interpretation,"The Hannes De Kassian Quintet, is a blend of traditional jazz with modern overtones. I bought the cd from him personlly and i still cannot stop playing it!"
3,Shrouded Isles,"Shrouded Isles offers some new pve areas to the original DAOC areas, also lets you teleport to different places. Can't say I like the way the game has gone since this came out, in '02 or so, began to feel too restrictive, maybe gated would be a better word. It's a good expansion of the original game. I'd have prefered player controlled horses, or something, to the teleporters. Travel is centered around teleporters now, especially with new frontiers(free expansion for rvr)."
1,Broken expansion and broken patches,"After purchasing a second PC to play this game I purchased an upgraded video card just to load this expansion.What followed was two months of troubleshooting, trying to solve the problems with patches 1.58 and 1.59.I finally gave up and cancelled both of my accounts. Mythic and their ""tech support"" was no help.Although I did enjoy the game when I was able to play, the constant updating of the software is a problem when there is little apparent testing of new code."
3,Nice addon.,"Not bad. Nice changes to the UI. New lands are impressive. I am pretty burnt on the MMORPG character-level treadmill, though, so my interest in the game itself suffered."
1,Save Your Money,"The game is not fun. It has nice graphics but they're never enough to carry a game. After all this time the game still has major coding flaws and failures like line of sight (which totally ruins and invalidates many major aspects of the game like sieges.) The classes will never be balanced. Population dispersement is a major issue when you have 3 realms with x, y, and z amount of people that can't switch sides. What happens when x + y < z? Z wins. Forced teams were a very bad idea.Once you hit the max level, 50, the game is over. There's nothing to do. This new expansion is nothing more than a weak attempt at encouraging current players to reroll as a new class or race in order to keep them occupied until they reach the nirvana of boredom that is DAoC's post-50 endgame.Save your money, a new crop of games are coming out in this genre over the next 6 months. Play Tetris while you wait."
1,Don't Buy This Junk,"Mythic is a horrible company. They are in it for the money. With all the nerfing, broken promises and extremely poor PR (Sanya) its obvious they don't care one bit about the game. Money is better spent elsewhere. This expansion is just a graphic upgrade and things Mythic promised would be free but instead are forcing people to purchase the expansion."
4,An excellent game..,"This is a MMORPG, much like Everquest, but, in my opnion, better.The graphics are to admired, the classes are diverse and entertaining.In Dark Age of Camelot you can actually be a casual gamer and see progress, you can be a powergamer and see a lot of Realm Vs Realm fighting.Realm Vs Realm (RvR) is basically Player Vs Player, but it is not forced, it never has to be done, but is always an option.Trade Skills mean something. Corpse runs are no more, unless you wish to pray at your grave for the bit of experience it will retrun to you.Overall, I enjoy this game, more than Everquest.I'd highly recommend it."
2,Good but gets boring fast,"This game is good, graphics are wonderful, gameplay is good however the game lacks challenge. Encounters are far too easy, soloing is far too easy which leaves you stranded for groups for long periods of time.It's more a game designed for the casual player, or console player than a person looking for a dedicated community with hard core challenges."
4,Great gameplay but could have more.,"This is a great game and you will want this is if you own the game or plan on geting it. The new grappix are stunning with vary little lag. Most 56kers will love this game considering it dont take much to run it. The game is loaded with a ton of game play.The down side to this game is, it could have more in. On day one on alot of peoples heads was they wanted horses in the game that they could buy was never added, they was spose to add housing before the expansion came out. Now they are not even talking about housing comming out any time soon. The expansion was spose to offer player housing but was also not added.So they left out alot of things people wanted and instead just added grappixs and new zones. But if you like the game as it is any ways you will like the expansion even tho they could have put more work in to it."
3,Mythic Entertainment,"I laughed, I cried, I passed out from boredom. The game has always been almost complete. SI appears to make it almost more complete. It's almost enough to stick with it. There is only so much to do before you are back doing it all again. Once you have done it all a few dozen times there is nothing more to do. I even voted Dzza for TL a few times with no real in game impact. The Vaun/Kunkoh star quests and Shaggy/Space battles are the only things new and fresh at this point. If they would only balance out the VN aspect I would call the game more complete. Hot celt women make it more enjoyable, but they always kill me. Oh well. Cheezits anyone?"
1,Don't buy,Buy Dark Age of Camelot but not the expansion unless you have a last month top o line computer. Couldn't play it and when I tried to get support from Mythic all I got was err...uhhh... you computer doesn't meet the minimum requirements. I bought my laptop not even 4 months ago and I know alot of people in game that have had similar problems. I got so tired of it that I quit playing DAOC alltogether. Maybe eventually I will go back to it but I have quit until I can get over my anger at Mythic
4,Still lacks information,"Well its like this, the reflexes in the water - i cant see them even with my geforce 4 but at least the water now moves its not staganated; graphical engine - ahhh, this where they made real improvements, smooth graphics and innovative colors of the interface; Music and SFX - added ambient music and ambient sfx wich create a different type of atmosphere; Commands&emotions - new emotions and commands gives a more personalized RPG; Races&Classes - Well i tryed the necromancer and i like it, new countries and NPC's.Overally the expansion pack really improved the game, but i think it lacks information, info on quests, abilities and skills i think its a problem that DAOC really needs to improve. Even the complete guides dont give us deep info in the definition of most skills and abilities."
2,Not for soloing,"This is an awesome game BUT, you must like to group with other people. DoaC will tell you it's easy to solo... yea right, when they first started playing this game 2 years ago it was nice but, they forget that with all the patches and miner fixes, they have completely nerfed all the classes in this game..If you don't like to group, you can solo to level 21 with ""tasks"" given buy guards. After that, forget about it!To many obnoxious kids running around..."
4,Solid video for those new to cycling,"Enjoyable video and the host/narrator does a really solid job sharing some basic thoughts on cycling. The multiple audio tracks make it easier to watch the video over and over while training. Only reason it is not 5 star is because the equipment he uses to ""smooth"" out the video ride make the entire image slightly blurry. Definitely not a sharp and clear image as he rides through the beautiful Colorado scenery. Overall, though, I would recommend to those who are new to cycling or want a more laid back training video."
1,cheap junk,"We bought a 15 yr old RV with these terrible cheap flimsy latches, most of which had broken. Lousy design, thin plastic and the worst part is the huge hole left in the door when you remove them. The price is absurd as well as the shipping. This is American junk too. Can't even blame the Chinese. I would advise yacht hardware, brass or bronze and built to last a life time."
4,The Recording Angel,"Sound recording is one of the most civilised applications of technology. This CD captures an extraordinary pianist in two works, readily available on CD, but not performed like this. Tragically, illness intervened but by a humble CD we do not need to imagine the legend: Janis is in our room at the touch of a button. The Hybrid CD/SACD does an excellent job of remastering compared to various earlier formats (US and UK vinyl and 16-bit CD) but despite the legendary Mercury living presence (sorry, that's RCA's slogan) it is far from state-of-the art sound. The astounding artistry soon immerses you in the music and you'll need a box of Kleenex to mop your brow regularly."
5,Fun squishy ball!,"We love Gertie balls and this is a fun one. Kids like balls but some are difficult to catch and hard when full of air for young players. Our three kids, boys 4 & 7 and girl 9, love the feel and softness of this ball. Develops hand eye coordination without fear of getting hit in the face with a hard ball. Very fun and deflates to take on a trip in your bag! Works in the pool too."
4,Just right for kids,I didn't get assess the size correctly for exercise purposes and had to give this to a 2-year old who loves it just fine. There is even a smaller size with a light that the dog and I love to play with. The grip is great for playing catch.
1,Wrong ball pictured still,"As notes by a reviewer in January 2011, the ball as delivered does not match the one in the picture. The ball delivered is a very small ball and not easy to catch for little kids because it is so small."
3,"Looks good, um.. i dunno","I must say, that this looks okay, i mean, sounds a lil corney, but it seems like a final fantasy, with more magic, or like kingdom hearts, i really dunno. so i'd like to try it, i guess...."
4,ALL HAIL MYSTIC HEROES!!!!!,"This is the best game I've played since NightFire. Good controls, graphics, gameplay, and story. The problem is sound. That is my only complaint."
2,Poor Game Altogether,"Of my collection of Game Cube games, this is DEFINETLY not my favorite. The adventures are not fun, as the action and the combat is stale and awkward. The attacks are not coordinated and the enemies are plain. The graphics are ordinary, certaintly not anything special. The multi-player absoulety stinks. With four seperate screens it is absoulely confusing and the four-fold screens are so small, little can be seen. A much better action game would be Super Smash Melee."
4,best cool game,this is the coolest game i play and attacks are super good. the story mode and milty play games are the best. survival mode is very hard. my onli complin is that i colud not open a door in the castle of kang where are the zombies.
4,Mystic Heroes,"This game is great. The graphics are really good and action wonderful.The game is like a combination of an RPG and an adventure adventure.In this game you can choose from four different players as your character and play in adventure mode and earn special runes for better magic attacks or play with up to four freinds and help each other out or battle against each other.Of course as like all games, though, it has its flaws. First of all the movies arent all that great. Also the characters voices dont exactly match the moving of the characters mouths.Other than that this game is perfect and once I beat it the first time I automatically went back and played it again with a different character."
1,This is a piece of Junk,"The bed is flimsy and the bottom is exposed foam, so it will not last at all. The fabric used is thin and cheap. Not worth even buying this, it will not last!They did refund all my money and the return was simple,"
4,GOOD FIT FOR SMALL DOG TO STRETCH OUT!,my mini schnauzer loves it! seems to be wearing well for her. could be a little sturdier..but fine for my dog
2,Easy to chew,My dog turned it over and chewed up the foam. He loved the bed but it was just too easy to destroy.
1,Majestic Dog Lounger Pet Bed,I just received the bed today. The overall impression is that its cheap and won't last a month. The cover material is very thin and I expect it not to make it though two or three washings. People in reviews complained on how hard it was to replace the cover after a washing. I'm sure that shrinkage due to the thin material also contributed to the difficulty.I'm debating on whether to return it.
3,Lounger Bed,"I found the product was not up to my expectations. For a large dog bed, the foam padding was very thin and I've found the larger the dog, the more support and cushion their joints need. Also The bed was pacakged in a way where it was folded in half, which only creased the bed and side bolster. The sherpa inside was nice and soft but the bed was labeled as XL large but for my 91 lb Doberman, it is not large enough."
2,dog bed,This bed was of poor quality.There was no return paperwork in the shipping.I would not recommend this bed.Not worth the money!!!!
2,Dog Pet Bed - Burgundy,"We bought this bed for our little puppy. We thought that the high price meant a good quality. However, the bed is not as soft as it looks on the picture. We are using an additional pillow to make it softer. Our puppy doesn't like this bed and she prefers her super soft bed from a local pet store."
1,Cheap product - DO NOT BUY!,"This is a piece of junk. It is literally a piece of foam with a cheap fabric cover on 3/4 of the foam. The bottom piece of foam is completely exposed, obviously allowing dirt and dander to collect on a part that you cannot wash. Do yourself a favor and buy a better and cheaper one at Costco or Walmart. Unfortunately, my husband received the package, opened it, and threw away the box/receipt before I got home."
1,Not as good as it looks.,"I ordered this bed in extra large for our retriever as I was finding it difficult to find a large bed. The size is fine, but the quality is disappointing. It is much more cheaply made and put together than it looks in the photo. When it arrived it had a terribly strong chemical smell. The cover does come off for washing, but is difficult to get back on and almost impossible to get back in its original position. Thus, once you wash it, it never looks the same again. The actual bed is just a shaped piece of foam that is only about 2 inches thick and has already compressed a bit. Our dog doesn't mind it (his other option is a tiled floor so the bed wins!), but I now regret not buying a more expensive bed because I'm going to have to replace this one in 6-12 months.(As one other reviewer said, I had no problems with the seller or delivery)Update: less than 6 months in and the foam on the bottom has already disintegrated. Really poor quality!"
2,"Good size for a large dog, cover doesn't stay on.","The bed was a good size for my 75 lb mix breed. The only problem was the cover came off to easily. I have 2 dogs and once they figured that out, they were constantly taking it off. Eventually, they took it off and proceeded to tear the foam bed apart as if it was a toy. I have had much better success with the pillow style bed from the same company. They both love that bed. They drag it around and lay on it. It has been great."
1,Cheaply made,"This item looks much better on the computer. It is cheaply made. The Fabric covers the foam, but not on the bottom.I would not purchase it again."
5,Great Purchase,Great product - our 95 lb. 1 year old golden retriever loves this bed - it is the only bed he has not chewed up and will sleep on!
2,"Very comfy for dog, but very difficult for owner","I had originally given a rave review of this product, because it seemed so fabulous after I first bought it. It is very thick and soft and comfortable, and I was excited for my dog to have such a nice bed. But after two washings, the zipper came off the cover! Try as I might, there's no fixing it (unless I want to fork out to take it to a zipper repair shop). Also, you can't imagine how difficult it is to put the cover back onto the foam cushion after removing it. It takes two people a world of effort to get it back on (the cover really grips hard to the foam, so it's really hard to move them past one another). I had chosen this bed because I wanted to be able to wash the cover every couple weeks, to keep my dog's bed clean, but it's just too exhausting to deal with. I really wish I hadn't spent all the money to buy this bed, because now I'm going to have to buy a different one."
5,A great help in understanding PKI,"Part of my job at an Internet security company is educating prospective customers on the mysteries of Public Key Infrastructure. I know from speaking to hundreds of customers that this is a technology that is foreign to many. In this book, Tom Austin does an excellent job describing, with good examples, each of the fundamental areas of PKI. Along with the well-written text, the book is richly illustrated and will clearly help the reader acquire a firm grasp of PKI. I'd like to leave a copy of this book with each of my prospective customers."
4,Leis are fun,The instructions in this guide are clearly written. The color pictures help a lot too.Crochet experience needed I would say medium.These are fun and can be used for more than just leis. Can be adapted to be purse handles or boas...instructions for that are not included but is easy enough to do.
4,Easy and Fun Aloha Project!,"This book is written in an easy to understand manner, with lots of helpful ""real-world"" suggestions. I was able to complete a four row lei in about five hours (and I'm a relative beginner to reading crochet instructions!) My only complaint is that the pictures could have been clearer - it's really hard to see the stitch definition when they are using Fun Fur!"
2,why doesn't your review include list of all musical songs,wish i could understand why all the songs in this movie aren't listed-since thats what most people are interested in-in reviewing this movie!
2,...,"This story wasn't anything special. The plot was semi-interesting, relationships being more 'unprofessional' then they should be at work, to include an after work club strictly for [Adult situations].The writing however was lack luster and I felt nothing what so ever for the main female character. The scenes, and let's be honest here this is WHY I bought the book, were lacking in build-up and passion. The average romance book has MUCH better scenes. I really felt nothing from this book, it didn't work for me."
3,Middling GBV,"I remember the excessive outpouring of critical hype that preceded the release of this album. Every pen jockey had GBV pegged as the next BIG THING. And this was the CD that was going to make them superstars. Uh huh. Instead, GBV released an okay album that pales in comparison to earlier efforts such as ""Bee Thousand"" or ""Vampire on Titus."" Some decent songs, but nothing to set my panties on fire."
1,Yikes,"I missed this album when it came out so I'm gonna report what I'm hearing today in 2011. What we have here is a bad record. Basically, it is 28 2 minute aborted ""songs"". ""Ex Super-Model"" had what sounded like someone snoring? Not sure. This made Pitchfork's best of the 90's list ahead of ""Exile in Guyville"" (a good album) -- go figure. I would borrow this from the library or a friend to see if you like it...which you won't. With so many great cds out there why bother with something like this?"
2,avoiding challenges,"why wait through a dull stanza to get to a hooky chorus? why take a brilliant intro and put it in front of a mundane song? gbv can be thought of as only serving up the good parts. the chorus stands alone; the intro stands alone. the bridge is a song unto itself and when that idea is done, the song is over and we're on to the next inspired idea. at least that's the way its supposed to work. me, i'm reminded of the film ""adaptation"" - yes, its clever to show your limitations and the smart way you've dealt with it. but i feel cheated out of the chance to see a really good film based on ""the orchid theif."" and i'm cheated out of hearing pollard's melodic ideas in a really good song."
2,Alien Lanes,"Alien Lanes being guided by voices 1995 release is truly a mediocre album with a sound that sounds like unfinished melodies and lyrics that were written on a lunch break. I usually somewhat agree with Allmusic when they write reviews. However, to give this unoriginal rock standard sound 3.5/5 is beyond me. The booklet is nothing short of a travesty with a horrid cover, font that makes you think they could have afforded a better printer. 2/5."
5,Let it grow on you.,"When I bought this album, I initially thought it was overated. It takes a lot of listens before you'll appreciate it. There are great songs, but even they don't stand out right away because of the challenging 28 songs. I've figured out that, for the most part, every other song is a serious attempt (and all of those are perfect pop), and in between you have punky song snippets that kind of act as glue. It's almost like you're tuning your radio and landing on a gem every other song. Of course, a lot of the snippets are growing on me as well. It takes a while to appreciate, but I think it may be stronger than Bee Thousand as a whole."
5,Seemingly endless possibilities,"My 6-month old daughter is fascinated by these blocks, right now mainly with the blue cube that has a jingle bell inside. While she is too young to stack the blocks, the bright colors, varied shapes, jingling noises and mirror are really appealing to her and she studies them intently. It's nice that this set is not just square blocks but includes round and cylindrical shapes that roll, and can see this being something she enjoys for a longgood quality time in ever-expanding ways. I like Haba products in general, which are made from nice woods and fabrics."
1,TOXIC.,"Please check healthystuff.org when purchasing toys. This item is rated HIGH for toxicity. Ridiculous. It takes an incredible amount of time and research to find safe, non-toxic toys for infants."
1,BEWARE TOXIC TOY!!!!!!!,"I wish I could give this no stars. I was so excited that a brand like HABA existed. I was looking for fun non-toxic toys for my first daughter and was pleased with many of the items I already purchased from HABA. I thought these would be perfect for her birthday but I was wrong. Not ever thinking I needed to second guess this brand, while looking up anothers toys toxicity I came across Healthystuff.org where you can check for toxic substances in toys. I typed in this product just to test the site and was shocked what I found. There is ARSENIC in the paint on these blocks. And lets face it, kids put everything in their mouths!! Don't buy these blocks for the health of your child. [...] check it out for yourself :("
4,As promised,"No zipper problems. No losing games. Everything in one place and protected. The case does what is should, protects the unit and gives you a little storage. I gave it 4 stars because it is a little expensive for what your get. For a 5 star review at this price, I think a few more bells and whistles would be required (shoulder strap, sepertae battery compartment, etc..."
3,Fits in Pixter case as well and it's a hard shell,"I was just online about to purchase the case when I saw the reviews, I wanted the cartridges to be enclosed as well as a hard case. Right now it's in the Pixter case and it fits perfectly so I guess I'll keep it there and perhaps get another Pixter case for the pixter although they don't use that as much any more."
5,Exceptional educational game/toy,"I purchased Leapster for my grandson for a dual purpose - educational and game. It makes him think he has a Gameboy but he understands the difference. He has gone through one set of batteries since Christmas day (2 1/2 days of use). I'm looking for another source of power to cut back on the batteries. He is totally mesmerized with this toy. He is ADHD and needs to have things moving, changing and interesting to keep his attention, boy does it ever. Thanks Leapfrog for another great idea. More games and accessories would be great also."
4,Great case,"This case is great for keeping the Leapster game system safe. It is very durable, and holds a bunch of cartridges. I am buying a second one for the Leapster my younger son is getting for Christmas."
3,not what it appears,I too was dissapointed about this case although we love the leapster. I purchased the case for a road trip and thought it was a hard plastic. I bought it online with a very poor discription from leapster's website. The extra cartridge storage isn't as secure as I feel it needs to be.
1,ZIPPER,Zipper broke in 4 days and this happened without the cartridge being in the leapster and no rough play. Not really well made I would avoid it if you can.
5,Great add on to your leapster,This has been great for our leapster. It has been helpful with keeping all our leapster stuff together. It fits our 7 games that we have plus of course the leapster. I would say that there is room for more games too. I would definatly recommend this to store your leapster and games.
4,Leapster Carrying Case,Protects your Leapster & stores all your cartridges. Have one for each of my children. Would absolutely recommend it.
1,NOT WORTH IT !!!,"Most reviewers here were writing only about the leapster and not about the case. My friend has a case. Fortunately I examined hers before buying one. I am glad I did not buy it. The case is soft and readily collapes. It is very poor quality. I wish I could give it 0 stars. The pocket which holds extra cartridges is simply a mesh pocket with an elastic band closure and it is easy for the cartridges to escape.Instead I purchased a small sturdy cosmetic case for eight bucks which works well. My friend ended up throwing hers away and buying a similiar case. Do not buy this, it is not worth the money."
2,The Backpack is much better,"Overall, I think LeapFrog is the best source for kids' game-type learning. The kids think they are playing, but we all know they are learning along the way. We were looking for a safe way to carry around my daughter's Leapster when we found the GameBoy backpack, and the backpack is a much better find than the Leapster case. Believe me -- this is the ONLY time I am not recommending a LeapFrog product, but rather am in favor of something else. The backpack fits tightly at first, but stretches just enough that my daughter can now easily zip and unzip the game area herself. There is quite a bit of storage for games (she has 5 now and there is still room for more...) Before you buy the Leapster case, try out the GameBoy backpack."
1,Leapster LMAX DOES NOT FIT,The Leapster LMax does not fit in this case. Manufacturer should tell you this. I have not been able to find a case for the LMAX
4,Returned this case,"I had originally bought this case, but returned it when I found the Leapster backpack on Amazon.com. It is padded on the side that lays against the body, just like most backpacks. It holds the cables, game & up to 10 cartridges. There is no damage done if a cartridge is left in the game. The cartridges are held in their own zippered pocket on the front. The game and cables have their own elastic pockets in the main compartment. I chose the backpack mainly because my son could carry it on his shoulder and would be less likely to drop it or lay it down and leave it. I believe I would have been satisfied with the smaller case if it had been my only choice, but I still like the backpack better."
4,"Nice case, not enough game storage.",It is imperative that you have this case with the leapster game. It protects the game and it hold the extra games that you need to take with you. I would have liked for it to have a bigger back pocket though for storage. I put an extra piece of velcro (sp?) so that it can close better because I carry an average of 9 games. It is compact which is good but I would have liked a little more room.
4,"Very handy, but a little tight...","It was driving me crazy trying to keep track of the tiny cartdriges for the Leapster, so this has come in very handy. It is a challenge to fit 6 extra cartridges into the small back pocket, though, and if there is a cartridge in the Leapster when you put it in the case it's pretty hard for my 5-year-old to zip (but no problem when the cartridge is out)."
3,Games aren't protected,The case is nice for protecting the leapster. My son actually dropped his from a height of 4' without any damage. But the compartment where the game cartridges are stores is not so well protected.
1,Broken Zipper Within Days!,"I ignored the other review on the broken zipper - and I shouldn't have! Our kids didn't use the case, just us parents. We were careful and guess what? It broke anyway. It would be a great case if the zipper wouldn't break."
1,Not a good idea...,"If kids don't open it just right, the Leapster falls out. Kinda defeats the purpose, if you ask me. I agree 100% with the comments about the Gameboy backpack. It's a snug fit, but it's great, because that means the Leapster doesn't come out until you take it out. The Gameboy backpack also has more room for games. The backpack idea is more popular with kids, too. All in all, skip this and go straight for the backpack."
4,set your world on fire,"this is great cd to give you the overall feel on jane's solo career. I really love some of the older cuts such as ""blue kiss"" which is sorta a classic to some people who love light headed fun pop. Of course you have rush hour which is so catchy and bouncy...i still remember the video with jane swimming among the dolphins. the dance clubesque song of the factory is a miss that should have hit big...hopefully this song will eventually be discovered for the great dance beat and ethereal feel to it. Anyway give this cd a spin...jane sounds like a little pixie...you just want to wave your wand over her and make her sing in her wispy way!"
4,Availalble for cheap on iTunes!,"Jane Wiedlin is such an under appreciated talented in this vacant pop world. However, fans of this fabulous performer needn't worry any longer, iTunes now sells this album for $11.99.My preference would have been for her to include gems such as, ""Sometimes You Really Get On My Nerves"" and ""Goodbye Cruel World."" But what can you do? Perhaps someday she'll release more hits on a slightly improved remastered CD."
4,"Poignant, and vivid","This book was written by my grandfather, Robert Twitchell (two l's), so I confess to being a bit biased. However, I have read the book, and think it worthy. My grandfather fought in the Pacific in WWII, and later returned. He was the only one of his group to return. His thoughts on seeing the places of violence peaceful again are the reading equivalent of Saving Private Ryan."
3,"Insightful in some respects, off-base in others","I thought that the book had some interesting things to offer, like their information on the dramatic increase in housing costs, as it relates to public education. They also note that people aren't spending as much on ""extras"" as we tend to think, but rather, that families are spending more on housing and cars and such. However, the book also seems to make excuses for poor or lacking financial planning. Upon the birth of one baby, a couple suddenly ""needs"" a large car with four doors because the baby might eventually have a sibling? Wouldn't it make more financial sense to wait on purchasing the more expensive car if one does not currently have a need for it?And while families may be spending the bulk of their money on the acceptable purchase of a house instead of designer handbags, the fact remains that each family tends to buy the most expensive house that their current income can afford, leaving little to no room to account for emergencies."
2,Trapped out of $18.20,"This book would be educational for a couple just starting out. Read it before the mortgage, the two SUVs, the kids... the voucher concept is intriguing, but the authors discount the benefits of private/homeschool education versus the obviously failing public schools. These alternative methods of education are worth it, in more ways than saving on a suburban home. Their suggested policies seem to be nothing more than more gov't regulation. Interestingly enough, the authors spend very little time on taxes and tax reform, something that is important considering most of the second income is needed to pay taxes. Socialism is not the solution.Although it could be argued that the book shows the reader what could trap them, it offers no real solution to those caught in the two-income trap."
3,"Some very interesting ideas, worth reading.","The were some very interesting ideas discussed in here, particularly regarding why a couple where both work full time may put them at higher risk for bankruptcy, and the details of why bankruptcy is related more to banks' lending practices than to the turpitude of the current generation. However the authors' solutions to solving some of these issues are at times unrealistic and are not always supported by solid evidence."
3,lifestyle choices matter...,"This book is a great reminder that the lifestyle choices that a person makes can have huge life altering ramifications down the road. Children are *expensive*, folks. At the oft-quoted figure of $250K to raise 1 child to age 18 - that is a huge financial impact upon a family. If I went out and bought 2 Ferrari's at $250K each, people would think that I was nuts, but conversely, if I went and had 2 children within a couple of years-well, I'd get a party at work for that. The book points out that 70% of people who are childfree don't ever have to deal with bankruptcy. The book does address remaining childfree as a path towards avoiding financial disaster, but then the authors turn around and say that they hope that people who want children will have them, regardless of the risk of financial woes. This is something that is under your control, and may be one of the more important decisions that you ever will make."
2,What ever happened to common sense?,"This book tries to say that people who indulge in materialism and luxurious living are victims.? Did they teach this at Harvard? Common sense tells us that if you spend more than you make you will probably go broke. It doesn't take a Harvard professor to figure out that...hey, maybe we don't need 2 brand new SUV's and that 6000 square foot stone house with the hardwood floors and 90"" plamsa tv screen."
2,OK Book for a light gender-biased read,"The book is outdated. The authors need to do a serious re-write. They also need to collaborate with advosors and professors and offer SOLUTIONS at the end. Sorry for such a pragmatic, logical gender-biased review. I bought it used so I have no regrets.John"
1,"a pitch for ""vouchers"" so the rich can keep their money","The first 50 pages is laden with footnotes to support their reasoning why the middle class is going bankrupt. Suddenly, with several pages devoted to how quite simply a ""good voucher"" system would solve every financially struggling ""middle class"" American family's problems, there is not a foot note to be found in support of their proposal. It's a weak argument to ""save"" middle-class (educated, well-off) families from having to go into debt to ""buy"" their kids a better education, and completely dismisses all the segregational ramifications, the issues of the chosen schools' task of making staff modifications to the influx of students, and the most important issue of all with vouchers: where the money will come from to pay for all this ""free and great"" education, which, by the way, is not free and will now not be great because of the new student to teacher ratio."
2,What a Waste of Pages,"The authors of this book spend two-thirds of the time blaming Everyone except the people who put themselves in this ""trap"" on purpose. This book is a warcry for middle class welfare. I find it hard to believe that the education system forces parents to move to a high-priced surburbia just to get away from ""marginal"" academics rather than assemble as a group of concerned parents to push the education agenda in more reasonably priced neighborhoods. The real trap is the sense of entitlement that the authors and their followers feel for luxury homes, vehicles, schools, and insurance plans. I will give them credit for highlighting the decay of the american financial system and for offering the few fire drill tips they pesented, but give me a break. I had to sit through two-thirds of the books whining to get to any valuable information. And that was after sitting through all their fancy ""statistics"" that murk up numbers presentation just as well as any politician does."
4,Needs more emphasis on tax burden,"I agree with several of the reviews already submitted which point out three signifcant factors: the tax burden in our country is not discussed at all; people are having too many children they cannot afford; and the financial industry is the ultimate benefactor of deregulation, not the poor, as the liberals had hoped.The authors do recommend that interest rates be regulated again to control predatory lending. However, the liberal approach to government requiring a program for everything has resulted in huge overspending and taxes that take 33% of a family's income. And, social problems have not improved in the last 40 years (except now everyone has a VCR and airconditioning, even if they are poor.) Personal responsibility and family planning are really the basis of achieving a succussful life in spite of setbacks."
3,Interesting read; but doesn't really offer any applicable solutions to the modern family.,"There were a lot of interesting facts in this book, that really make you think about two-income families. However, while the author(s) are excellent at describing tear-inducing situations that tug at the heart, they are unfortunately unable to provide very much in the way of applicable help for the families who are struggling within the 'two income trap'. The changes that they do suggest would take monumental governmental intervention and a very large dose of time to fix."
3,"Good data, limited analysis","This book provides many interesting statistics on financial troubles among U.S. households. That said, I didn't necessarily agree with the authors interpretation of peoples financial problems. These authors put nearly all the blame of financil disaster on the society at large, not the individual consumer. It's the banks, gov't, big-box stores, schools, healthcare,... Although I believe all of these are a part of the puzzle, the foundation rests on a citizen (consumer) being suckered in to believing he ""needs"" a new car ever 5 years, a $300,000 house in the suburbs in a ""safe"" neighborhood, and prescription insurance for every drug that's on television.If you do read this book, follow it with ""Your Money or Your Life"" by Dominguez. Perhaps the best book ever written on individual financial responsibility."
5,REQUIRED READING ! ! !,"YIKES! This book provides great insight into the trap of the two income family. From ""hidden"" costs such as childcare to the hardship of medical care, this book will definitely open your eyes to how most American families are living. Statistically, more Americans are buying home based on dual-income mortgages than before. Coincidentally, if one of the two wage earners lost their job, they would be one paycheck away from mortgage foreclosure. Sad but true, this book will help anyone realize that the dual-income strategy may not be the best plan for success and happiness....Mason Johnson, President, www.TomorrowsGold.com"
3,The workforce doubled - that is what happened,"The book presents some interesting data. My personal opinion is the book totally overlooks the obvious. When women entered the workforce, the supply of workers doubled. That drove down wages, granted, not by half, but the ability of one income to provide for all the needs and nice-ities certainly was eroded because that income was less. Who benefited from that? Corporations and businesses. The dirty little secret is the workforce supply increase caused downward pressure on wages. When people ask why can't a family live as comfortably on one income as they did 30 years ago, that is the answer. When people ask where the money went, the answer is it went to the corporations and businesses that were the beneficiaries of the women's movement. As a side observation... 30 years ago, were CEO's multi-multi millionairres, or just a rich family in town, like a doctor or lawyer? Food for thought."
5,Fresh College Grad - New to workforce and newly married,"Must read for young people new to the workforce or just married.In just 2 years into the corporate world, I have already witnessed how fragile job security can be, and how rapidly corporations downsize to focus on their bottomline.That experience has left me with a deep sckepticism on the current trend and mindset of buying a house early to start building your ""equity""; especially when you have little saved up and are hedging against your future job security, which may not be so safe after all.I would really encourage young readers to read this book and think broad and long term about possible consequences and changes that life situations can bring upon; and start with a wise and emotion-less approach towards making major life decisions (such as buying a house)."
5,A Book Everyone Should Read,This book gives amazing insight to a problem in our society that is still current. Read this book and gain insight into a way to change your lifestyle to have a less stressful life that is balanced and more financially stable.
1,No Responsibilty to Spenders,"In typical liberal fashion (backed up by Ted Kennedy's support on the back cover) the authors blame every one but the spenders themselves for the growing rate of bankruptcy. They then suggest massive federal programs - vouchers, price controls, reregulation of banking - as the cure all instead of expecting people to live within their means. Instead of suggesting solutions that require the responsible majority of this country to bail out the weak willed through their taxes, why not suggest a program that would actually allow people to maintain a budget. This book is full of blame for large companies, evil banks, and even the housing market itself - but constantly asserts that the financial problems of two-earner families are not their fault."
1,She contradicts what she said in the past,"Here she calls two incomes a ""trap"". Yet in a New York Times article published on Sept 3, 2000, she is quoted saying:""Two incomes represent the only strategy most people have to spread the risk of unemployment or catastrophic medical bills. Our data show that if either spouse is unemployed, the chance that the family will be in bankruptcy skyrockets by about 320 percent. Following divorce, the chances of filing bankruptcy triple, and that risk falls again, statistically, only when a divorced woman remarries. The bankruptcy data show that a two-earner family is not a matter of choice, but of economic survival.""[...]So are two incomes a ""trap"" or are they ""the only strategy most people have to spread the risk of unemployment or catastrophic medical bills."" What, if anything, does she really believe? Or does she just say what she thinks will help get her elected?"
1,Don't waste your money on this book!,"Don't waste your money on this book - instead donate the price of the book to your local public school.What a disappointment!I would have hoped for more from the authors, given their qualifications, but instead the solution this book proposes is SCHOOL VOUCHERS!"
3,ReViEw,This novel is generated mostly around the mother and her obsession to the casino where her and her family go for a celebration of the mother's boyfriend getting hired to his new job.the book is interesting in the beginning until it gets to the middle where you could just guess and infer what's going to happen.It was very evaluating but got boring because no real action starts to happen except the mother's obssesion becomes overwhemingly out of control and she has no money to go to the casino so she sneaks into her daughter's room in the middle of the night and takes her money for the slots.The book concludes on a consistent basis and when you read it it's not gonna end the way people infer it will end.It's more of a movie type plot and theme doesn't really catch the attention of the readers like it should.The topic was depicted great but it just lacked focus and enmtertainment.
5,Love Gunsmoke!,"Family friendly show with only a few episodes that include a mature topic. Always presented in a way that brings a great discussion with my kids. Right doesn't always win, but again, another good discussion topic with my kids! Much better than what many modern shows offer. Also, brings in some historical issues - again, great for discussion."
5,Husband's favorite.,Now have up to 5 seasons of this great western TV show. It is by far my husband's favorite show in his collection.
3,Not the American Star,This is Nordicware's Star bundt pan and it is a great item.....but they do make one called the American Star and it is different from the pan pictured.
2,A Star Performer,"This pan is my favorite! Not only does it create a dramatic presentation, it's a dream to use. I worried that I'd end up digging cake out of the sharp angles of this mold--no problem! I just grease and flour the pan, and my cakes slide right out. I've even baked bread in it--it's the best way to tell this pan heats evenly. My bread is perfectly browned and crusty, and looks fabulous. I'd recommend this pan to everyone."
4,Solid Quality,"One piece of information that would have helped me when reading reviews of this item: It's very heavy and solid feeling. I can see why it costs more than the similar, but less expensive, model. When I read that it was made from aluminum, I imagined a lighter wieght product. Also, one thing to keep in mind is that it is slightly more difficult to remove cakes from the more detailed mold. You can't slide a rubber spatula down the side as easily as you can with a more traditional shaped bundt pan."
4,it makes me happy:),"i love the whole concept of mixing the traditional irish sound with fastpaced, hyper punk rock. and i know they didnt invent this concept, but they are certainly the best at it. great mix of slow, midtempo, and insanely fast paced songs...they blend together nicely, giving the cd a lot of variety. after seeing them in concert, and feeling the pure energy, i had to buy the cd. it doesnt disappoint."
3,Far Cry From Fastway,"Who would have thought - Fastway for the 80s, the shortlived Katmandu for the 90s, and now Flogging Molly. Dave King sure knows how to play his cards."
4,Good Californian Irish music,"This band wants to be the Pogues so bad their mannerisms and faux-Irish singing sometimes come off a bit too forced. That said, this record has really good songs and a great sound. Since the Pogues are dead, I'm happy to see Flogging Molly live."
5,One of the best live bands and the best record of the year,"So who is this Flogging Molly? I'd never heard of them before. I was just going to a Bosstones concert at a small club in Raleigh. I had never heard of the opening band from across the pond but oh man could they rock. They are hands down one of the best live bands I have ever seen. If you ever get the chance you have to see them (the girl that plays the fiddle is way cute too). Even if you never see them live you'll love the CD. It's an incredible blend of pop, rock and Irish folk."
4,Irish Punk,"This is an album that I am truly proud to own. I can be guaranteed that none of my other friends would have heard of them, let alone understand the concept of Irish punk rock. Having reflected on this concept myself, I find it makes more and more sense. There is that fighting Irish spirit that translates so well into aggressive music. Keeping the traditional instruments in there is a stroke of genius. It truly fits my mood when I am a bit mad or happy. I like this loud Irish gig, though the mix of slow songs throws me off occasionally. Fun, especially the popular ""Every dog has its day"" and the fast ""Devil's dance floor."""
5,You'll never find anything better,"This CD rocks!!! I've been a hardcore Flogging Molly fan for about a year now when some guy at a cd store asked me what kind of music I liked and said I might like this. Being extremely proud of my Irish heritage and an everlasting Celtic music fan, this fits right in with my punk-side as well. I intoduced my boyfriend and another friend to this band a few months ago, and now they're as hardcore as I am! But I am deeply saddened because my precious Flogging Molly cd has scratches from being listened to so much and it won't play the whole way through. Check out Drunken Lullabies as well! It's a wonderful follow-up to Swagger."
5,Celtic punk music? Why not?,"Probably the easiest way to describe this band is as a Celtic punk band. It's an intriguing sound, hearing a fiddle play along with fast, energetic guitars. The CD mostly jumps from those fast songs to slower, almost folksy songs about Ireland or Irish history. If that sort of things sounds interesting, then you should give this band a shot. I just recently discovered the band and I'm really enjoying this and their other albums."
5,Mollys best,"One of the best albums I have ever heard.I play it straight through, every song is excellent.The best from Flogging Molly."
5,We Will Never See The Likes Of Them Again,"I found out about Flogging Molly in a slow, roundabout way. I started with some hardcore Boston punk, moved to Dropkick Murphy's, and finally to FM. I honestly have to say that this is one of the best albums ever written. I am usually a purist when it comes to music, im punk all the way, but regardless of your preferences you can't deny that this is one of the most musically rewarding albums of all time. The instrumentals make you feel like you're in Ireland and the lyrics make you feel like you're spending a rainy day in a pub singing your favorite songs. Swagger has the perfect mix of up-beat and slow songs. My personal favorite tracks are ""These Exiled Years"", ""Devils Dance Floor"", and ""Far Away Boys""."
5,Wonderful,"This was exactly what I was looking for. It was the right size to fit into my pencil case, was perfectly clear so I could see underneath the ruler to the paper underneath. Not only that, but it was a great price!"
1,This is not a full length robe.,Despite this seller using a picture of an ankle length robe it is actually knee length. I'm not sure if the seller is sloppy or being purposely deceptive but I'm stuck with the return fees now. I'm tried calling customer service but sat on hold until I just gave up. I won't be buying from this company again.
3,Wacky stuff,"I liked this creative movie very much. The characters were well played, specifically the character of ""Porno Guy"" played by Mike Mandt. Mandt stole the show and has become an icon with a cult following. Unfortunatly, Mandt is engaged to be married so I guess all those young men and women who had posters of him on the wall are upset. His portrayal of a porn star in Hijacking has sadly caused him to be typecast as a sleazy, sick and twisted, sexually perverted deviant villan. I'm sure he will eventually make a move into the adult movie buisness."
2,Soft Porn Comedy,"This movie is categorized as a comedy but is really a soft porn movie. The character ""porno guy"" appears to have sex which makes this movie alltogether innapropriate for minors or tasteful adults. I think it would make more scense if the producers released as an adult film the short porno movie starring ""porno guy"" which runs within the ""Hijacking"" movie. They should, in effect, scrap Hijacking Hollywood, and release the adult flick that has created all the buzz."
2,"Mike Mant, the porno, guy is on the clock","So, what exactly is the deal with that shady porno guy -- Mike Mant -- who appears in this movie?? He seems like like a decent guy despite his incredibly poor acting skills; what was the deal with his facial expressions? I know he was trying to replicate the look of guy in the middle of having sex, but he instead had the disturbed look on his face of a guy who has just been put on the clock because he has been dating a girl for years and just found out that his good friend got engaged after dating someone for only eight months. He really needs to work on his acting skills."
1,What's the deal with that Michael Mant guy???,"Did anybody else notice that really scummy/shady looking guy who played the part of the porn star in the porn movie that the two main characters watched. I watched for the credits. His name is Michael Mant, and god, what a shaddy character he is. He gives me the willies. I would never leave my children alone around him."
1,Mike Mant -- the most ungodly looking human/act imaginable,"There is this seen in this movie where the characters watch a pornographic film -- which in itself is not offensive. What is offensive, disgusting, anti-catholic, vomit inducing is the male character in that film. He is one of the more frightening individuals I have ever seen, may god have mercy on his soul."
5,Nigel Wilkinson,This is an excellent addition to the film which is rated as one of the best of the Second World War.
2,Little to do with the film itself,"I anxiously awaited getting this book from England, and was VERY disappointed. Instead of getting into the heart of the film, it was, ""This person flew this plane during this scene,"" This person flew this plane during this scene"", etc. BLEAH! There was little else. I could have gotten this information from IMDB.com"
2,worst crash ever,you can not control this. when it crashes it fall apart. called horizon and they told me too bad. have my mom call with a credit card and they could give me somethig else. company is bad too
3,OK but concerned,Maybe some will get the worng impression about the movie. That its saying that this is how all black people are ..HMMM?
3,Could Have Been So Much More,"To summarize this film: All whites live in the ghetto, and all blacks live in mansions. In a role reversal that is supposed to open people's eyes, blacks are the ruling class and whites are the oppressed.The problem here is that only extremes are shown. Where is the middle class? Where are the Hispanics? Where are the Asians? This movie could have made a powerful statement on class in America. Instead, it wallows in a poorly-conceived mellodrama about racial role reversals. What a disappointment."
2,HUGE Potential here....,"VERY little tapped. It's not that the talent was lacking; it was there to spare. But the script bordered on lame; it was almost completely predictable and even amateurish in spots. You could see the ""reverse Rodney"" thing coming 200 miles away, and the dialogue was so bad it was almost laughable. You really have to be a fan of someone in the film to take this even semi-seriously. A shame, because this could've been so much more with a different screenplay and director...."
3,Skewed Stereotypes,"This movie takes a 180 degree turn on the stereotypes given to blacks and whites. In it, it is the blacks who are in control, educated, and well-spoken. The whites live in the slums, work the low wage jobs, and commit most of the crime. All the black cops are racist, all the black bosses look down on their white employees, and all the rich black people are snobby and superficial. All the poor whites are criminals, prideful and have over-nagging mother-in-laws. It was rather fascinating to see the various racial stereotypes turned on their heads; what better way to show us how rediculous such broad generalizations are than by giving them to groups who we never would have thought of in that way?"
3,good watch,It does make you wonder if that would really be that things were the other way around. It was an interesting movie.
1,Be Careful When Ordering-They Won't Let You Return It!,"I ordered this pillow for my husband. The pillow arrives all folded up so you have to open it to try it out. My husband tried it for 5 minutes and didn't like it. In fact, the pillowcase that comes with it is still in the original packaging. I have tried to return this but I was told that because it was opened, it cannot be returned. How can you try something that is folded up. Also, when the pillow is shipped, it is in a storage bag with a locked zipper. This is not an inexpensive item. I would think twice about ordering this pillow. If you do and don't like it, you are stuck with it. Shame on Medslant and Amazon for such deceitfulness."
2,Husband couldn't sleep with it.,The product looked great. Unfortunately my husband couldn't sleep propped up. I tried it (although I don't have reflux) and couldn't sleep either. It's now either in the closet or occasionally used as an expensive prop to watch tv. I wish I'd bought a cheaper version first.
1,"This item is garbage, and the company is a SCAM.","Purchased this product to help my acid reflux. If you know anything about the desired angle required for comfortable acid reflux relieved sleep. THIS IS NOT THE PRODUCT FOR YOU. Way too short and tall. And on top of that they will not accept my return of this product. I have already shipped it back to them, and they can keep it. I guess they're in the practice of stealing money. Good luck if you try doing business with them."
4,Med Slant pillow,I have been able to deal better with my drainage since purchasing this slant pillow.
5,Folding Feature is Nice,This pillow comes folded and fits neatly inside a carrying case. The fact that it can be folded for storage and/or transport is a great feature. Thanks!
1,Medslant Pillow,"I ordered the Medslant pillow for my husband who is a dreadful snorer. I am desperate to find something - anything - to reduce his awful, endless snoring. Friends recommended Medslant because they have enjoyed many snore free years with it. The reviews I read were very mixed but I felt it was worth a shot. My husbands first use of the pillow resulted in absolutely no reduction of his snoring - I can't say it made it any worse though since he is already at the top of his game in that department. In the morning he claimed he was unable to sleep comfortably. The pillow too long, he kept sliding down, the shallow end of the wedge bothered his hip. In other words very depressing results as far as I am concerned. He tried again just a couple of nights ago with similar results.***On a positive note - This product was ordered the week before Christmas and Amazon got it out to me in my little cabin in the boonies BEFORE it was scheduled to arrive. Amazon's service was excellent!"
4,Great travel wedge,"I've been blocking beds for years, due to acid reflux, but many motel beds are now set on box frames and cannot be raised. Plus it is often difficult to crawl under bed to get blocks under the legs. This wedge eliminates all of that and makes traveling worry free. it is also very convenient to travel with, in it's case. Love it. I'm a tall guy, so a little longer would be nice for me."
3,Seems radically overpriced,Nice size and length of slant. Ridged foam material is comfortable. I like the product but it seems absurdly overpriced - like actual cost may be closer to $5.
4,Wedge,It took a little getting used to as it isn't like my mattress but now I fall asleep right away and it does seem to help.
2,Poor Design,The determination to make this pillow foldable for travel spoiled what would otherwise be a good product. The two piece design causes the bottom part to become unstable and move as you move and thereby hurting your lower back.
2,Way Overpriced,"I ordered this pillow six months ago after a nasty bout with GERD. I have been satisfied with the results, however after six months the foam has started to compress a bit. It doesn't seem to be holding up that well, not like I'd expect a $100 pillow to hold up. For a wedge shaped piece of foam, it's just not worth the price. Plus, even with the case, it's still not very portable."
2,READ THE FINE PRINT!,"Although the MedSlant representative correctly states that the product description clearly states that this product cannot be returned, this comes in small print at the very end of a lengthy product description. With Amazon's usual excellent customer service, this disclaimer should be at the top of the page along with the price, etc., so the purchaser cannot miss it. It is my own fault for not reading every word (does anyone?) I would never have ordered it had I known it could not be returned. Shame on you Amazon and MedSlant."
2,Works as described...for about 3 months,It worked as described on arrival. However the foam is so light weight that within 3 months I was having back problems due to lack of support at the hinge where it folds. Had to go back to my generic medical supply wedge I've had for over 10 years. And the foam still provides decent support.
3,Good help for acid reflux,Been using for about a month and it helps a lot. It is starting to compress however so I am not sure how long it will be helpful. I am sure a mattress with the same incline would work much better but at a much higher cost.
3,Medslant pillow,Pillow cover is two piece and inner cover very difficult to remove for cleaning. Price seems high for a piece of foam rubber and a cover.
4,Liked it,It helped with my Acid Reflux. I had the Wedge Pillow for a while and it really keeps my acid reflux down at night. I am happy with it. Took a little while to get used to it.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS RIP-OFF!!,"The pillow is very stiff and made of very poor quality. It's a rip-off! Worst of all, you cannot test it because, once you open the product, ""it is yours to keep"" since they will not accept any returns. Once you open the bag containing the pillow, it is yours (because you need to break the zipper to do it). Surprise!!! It's all yours!!!I chose ""one star"" because there is no ""zero star"" choice."
2,Still kicking myself,"This pillow is elevated to the point that one can not avoid sliding off of it, therefore defeating the purpose of the pillow. Way too expensive. Not worth it."
1,Buyer Beware!,I used this pillow twice and had severe back pain. The angle is too high and pillow is very hard. Tried to return it and was told that it is non returnable. Think twice before ordering. It was a very expensive mistake.
1,Make sure you read the fine print,"Make sure you read the return/refund policy all the way down at the bottom under all the reviews and click on the policy to find out that as soon as you order it is not returnable. Unfortunately, I didn't go all the way down to the very bottom and click on that tab."
5,Great for allergy / sinus problems,I have allergy and sinus problems. Sleeping on the MedSlant pillow has helped me sleep through the night and has reduced my congestion.Great customer service.
2,NOT LONG ENOUGH,"I used the MEDI=SLANT wedge pillow for my GERD for about two months (my third try at an effective wedge pillow). I would start the night with my head at the top of the wedge, and every morning my head would be at the bottom of the wedge-hardly elevated. I kept slipping down no matter what I did. I Also I found this pillow was not particularly comfortable. I then spent-gulp! $250 for a super long (42 inch) memory foam wedge pillow and at last - SUCCESS! I stay elevated, and very comfortable."
4,Get it for travel,"If you normally sleep on a wedge at home, you have to have this travel wedge. It's light, comes in an easy to carry bag, and gives enough elevation to keep comfortable without having to lug your larger, non-portable wedge around. I use a Bedge at home and the MedSlant when I go away on overnight car trips."
5,This Pillow works,I bought this pillow for my husband. He used to snore (hold his breath) a lot and he used to often take sleeping pills to help him sleep through the night. It took him a few days to get used to this new pillow and now he loves it. I rarely hear his snore any more and he sleeps much better and hasn't taken sleeping pills for a while. Even our cat likes to sleep on the top edge of the pillow. Highly recommended by my husband and I for anyone who has trouble sleeping.
3,Too firm to be comfortable.,The firmness and steep angle of the pillow make it hard to rest on easily.We still have it but no longer use it regularly.
5,Great Pillow!,"Great Pillow. I have suffered with acid reflux for 10 years, and it really helps. I only wish I had gotten it sooner."
3,Pillows are not holding their shape,"The pillows are ok. However they are not holding their shape very well We combine 2 into 1 to get the height needed which is a bit disappointing for what we paid. The pillows seem to have ""smashed"" down in height instead of holding firm. I would have thought the incline piece would have held the height better.I hope this is understandable but if you have questions please call 573.221.0650Gloria ColemanConsumer"
4,Great for acid reflux,"I bought the wedge pillow to assist in reducing night-time GERD symptoms, and it has certainly helped. Only cons...it's a little long, since I'm 5'4"", and this pillow could easily fit someone a foot taller; and the pillow came with only one pillow case."
3,You do get what you pay for,"I found that while this unit's price was appealing, and it was easy to use, the converted signal was only adequate. There was a pattern of lighter and darker lines scrolling up the screen. This was going from PAL to NTSC3 format."
1,Not as good as announced.,"Looked OK on paper but, it stated that it could playback any tape, but PAL N and PAL M don't work, their brochure lies. That was 75% of the intended use. I also notice severe strobing on bright scenes while playing back PAL I (I mean severe, not the 25 fps strobe), don't see this on a Samsung SV-5000W playing the same tape. You get what you pay for, and this is a cheap VCR, so..."
2,Careful with this one - No Tuner or Timer,You may miss from the spec sheet (as I did) that there is no tuner or timer on this machine. The converter works well but you will only use this as a secondary VCR.
1,Not worth it,"Forget the Emerson converting VCR - it's a piece of junk. Besides being flimsy (it is, afterall, an Emerson), this VCR does an inadequate job of converting different tape standards. It will allow you to view different tapes on American TVs and it is an inexpensive unit, but for $50-$100 more, why not purchase a converting VCR that will do more than a lousy job? There are, afterall, other VCRs that have this capability. If you are in the market for a converting VCR consider one of the many that Samsung manufactures. They are specialists in this field."
4,Emerson - can't beat it for THAT price!,"Great price; comparable units go for $500-$800 (aiwa, samsung, etc...) Appearance is great, (why oh why can't it be black?). Seems a bit on the flimsy side, but oh well. Major turn-off is that it's only got 2 heads, and unfortunately no S-Video option. But, again, for the price you can't go wrong! Here's a puzzle: Try finding Emerson on the Web! Good Luck! Darrel"
2,multi-system vcr,"Having just purchased this product, I found that recording from tv channels very difficult and am unable to change channels on the vcr's remote control or the vcr itself. There is also no way to program the vcr for timer recording. I am not at all satisfied!"
1,skeleton key 2,skeleton key 2...is one one those movies that should have never been made..it has nothing to do with the movie skeleton key..i made the mistake of buying it..i wanted to stop it when it first started..it's bad and i mean bad..the best thing to do with this movie is trash it..and that's what i am going to do...
5,Style that mirrors the painter,"Bjrstad did a wonderful job portraying Munch with his style and prose. This dark book is a fabulous read, especially for fans of art history and Edvard Munch. The book does not read like the average novel, but the style is quickly and easily adapted too. I strongly recommend this book."
4,Another wonderful read by Dominique Browning!,"Absolutely loved her new book - SLOW LOVE, and read this after that. She has a special way of writing. Her love for her home and garden and family is so evident. Thank you. Keep writing please."
2,Not Durable,"My 3 year old daughter and I have no problem making good size bubbles with this wand. The design is nice, it snap back easily for storage and the color is nice. However, after using it twice, the plastic hoop at the snapping piece and the stick is twisted. This makes the hoop to be wailing back and forth even though it was snap in place. It makes the wand impossible to make bubble by waving. My daughter was frustrated. I eventually went with some cheap plactic wands that do not have the fancy mechanism and they are extremely durable with many abusive use from a little child. I don't recommend this wand."
2,Not so great,GO with the Gazillon products... they work better and easier clean up too. This dripped like crazy and made BIG mess.
2,NO BUBBLES,I found the toy to be a waste of money. My daughter is 4 years old and loves to play with bubbles. It was difficult for her and also myself and her grandmother. We all gave it a shot and we failed to make bubbles. Now it lays outside and she never played with it again.
2,Many problems,"I wish I had checked more into this product before buying. Almost any other household appliance will interfere with this monitor (microwave, vacume, radio, white noise sound machine, etc.) Also video quit working after 9 months...called and only a 30-day warranty.....I will be buying another MUCH better rated monitor from Amazon this time. Do NOT buy."
2,Inflexible & High Interference,"Because the camera eye moves only in one direction, the device had to be permanently attached on a wall across baby's bed. You have to decide whether you want sacrifice the resolution to see the entire crib (older child can crawl away from the view) or see just a part of it. We have cell phones and wireless network so static was pretty bad. We went with Graco's excellent digital iMonitor."
2,Bid Deception,This product promises great sound and picture. It does not deliver. Static is everywhere. Even tried to shut down all other wireless devices in the house. Does not work. Would not recommend this product at all....
2,"KILLS WIFI, DESIGN IS FLAWED AS YOU CANNOT MOUNT ON A WALL OVER A CRIB","At first glance the Mobicam looks great and the initial reviews I read seemed good. I should have checked further. The first problem with this is the design. There is a wall mount attachment that comes with it but the camera does not tilt all the way down so if you mount the mobicam on a wall above a crib it shoots the opposing wall rather then pointing directly down to the crib. Then I thought I can somehow mount it to the ceiling, but then it occured to me that I cannot get the power cord up there. Also, the power cord is only 3 feet long, way to short to mount it high enough. I had to go out and buy shelves and install them and then strap the thing to the shelf to get it to point down.Then we turned it on and it killed our WIFI network.I am over this thing. I am going to see if there is a better one out there."
3,ok,"Helpful, but not amazing. Neat product. Batteries run out in one day. Often is like an old t.v. set where the line keeps going through the picture. Sound carries lot of static. Performs best when not running the microwave or near my computer. (If I sit at my computer I can't simultaneously watch baby.) Did learn how my dogs get stuff off the kitchen counter. Can't wait to get a remote control car and duct tape the camera onto it so I can patrol the house from one spot."
1,Don't buy,"I got a mobi-cam because my child didn't make noise when she woke up. My mobi-cam always had interference and static. Resolution was poor at best. Within 4 months the camera stop showing, although I could sometimes have sound. When I contacted Mobi Technologies the person told me the warranty is only for 30 days - nothing they would do. DO NOT buy this."
2,Buy a different one!,"I bought this about 10 months ago with an additional camera. The night vision only works on one of the cameras and the interference is horrible. It snaps and pops all night long and I have to move it all around to find ""just the right spot"".I actually have to sleep with earplugs in to drown out the noise. I live in a single story 2100 sq. foot house. I should have returned it right away, but I kept it because I had no other monitor at the time. Now, 10 months later, the volume control does not work anymore! I am now trying to find a new monitor. I love having the video monitor though, so I will look for a different brand."
1,Perfectly uselesss!,"I received this monitor as a baby shower gift, but it was something I had particularly wanted. I was extremely disappointed when I found it didn't work at all! There is so much sound interference it's impossible to tell if the noises are the baby or the interference. We disconnected every electronic appliance in the house (cordless phone, microwave, even turned off our cell phones) and still the interference was there. The video reception is awful, supposed to be up to 300 feet, we are only roughly 20 feet away and still the picture is terrible. I swear it was supposed to have ""night vision"" - forget it, non-existent. I'm off the video monitoring; I'm on-line now to buy an old-fashioned voice monitor."
2,"Static, short warranty, waste of money",We have static all night even after unplugging everything we own. I could live with that but now it has stopped working on A/C power and it's past the 90 day warranty (only 5 months old and it just sits on the nightstand)so it would cost me $60 for them to look at it. I told them that I am an electronics technician and if the would just send me the parts I would fix it myself but they don't sell parts so it's off to radio shack for a workaround.
4,Overall a good product,Only issue is running the microwave with the Mobi Cam. Mobi becomes static. We did not have any issues with our wireless as others have stated and overall we find a least 1 or 2 of the 3 channels will work well.
1,did not work off the bat,Very dissappointed. My son (I bought this for them) hooked it up and there is so much interference it cannot be used. Audio just static and noise.I did find it interesting that the instructions tell you it might NOT work. Try telling this to me before I purchase thank you. This is the last I purchase equipment on-line. I will stick to books thank you very much.
2,"Monitor Failed, company will not return email","When this monitor arrived I was extremely happy with both the camera and the monitor. However I only used the monitor a few dozen times and the AC adapter (so we thought) failed. We purchased several adapters and still nothing. We now think that it has something to do with the connection inside the monitor. So basically we now have to use batteries. The batteries only last about one night, as you can tell we go through batteries like water....not good. I have emailed and called the company several times and I have not gotten a response. We paid well over what I would normally pay for a baby monitor. The total price including shipping was $177.95, I would expect the thing to work or at the very least I would expect the company to take responsibility and respond."
1,Nice video system BUT does not work with wireless network,"This wireless video system arrived and seemed perfect...until I turned it on. Our house is full of 2.4Ghz stuff like cordless phones and a wireless network. Sad to say the receiver didn't function well at all in this environment--so many static lines and jumps that it was virtually worthless. Other than the fact that it was not designed to operate with simple wirelss items that the majority of American homes now have, it does seem to be a sweet little wireless video system. Perhaps if you live in a vacuum in the middle of no where it would be perfect to keep an eye on the local wildlife... :O)"
2,Not worth the money,"I bought this baby wireless cam thinking that it would be just as wonderful as all of the posts I read about it. I was WRONG. I have wireless internet and I'm unable to use the internet while the monitor is on, or even pluged in!! Even when the computer is turned off, there is still static in the monitor. A horriable ticking sound . Then only good thing about this item is the picture. The picture quality is great in complete darkness, the only down fall is the line going through the monitor. Other than that it isn't great. All in All, I am back to using the audio monitor. Waist of money!!!"
3,Mediocre Camera,"Works adequate as a baby monitor and if you have straight line of sight for short distances. If you plan on using this indoors the coverage is limited in scope providing a great deal of interference. As for the 1.5"" monitor, lets just say that I have 20/20 vision and it makes me strain to see what is going on. Best to connect to a TV or monitor to enhance viewing capability. If you really have a legitimate source to monitor, I would recommend that you spend a bit more money and purchase a cctv camera."
1,Buyer beware...,"We live in New York City and purchased this after our son was born. Unless you are willing to unplug your cordless phones every time you want to use this monitor, you can forget about getting any kind of decent reception. Additionally, even with the phones unplugged, the static is still unbearable to fall asleep to at night and the picture comes in and fades out at random. For a lot less money, though without the video picture, Graco Ultra Clear Monitor works like a charm."
5,Very pleased,"We wanted a camera to watch our kids while they slept to make sure that they were ok rather than always walking into the room. I read the reveiws and the description and realized the monitor screen was small, but I wanted audio and a color camera. I am very happy with the product. I can see just fine, and the night time vision is great. Of course it's not DVD quality video, but I would definitly recommend this for anyone who wants a video. And it's portable! Yes, a little pricey, but for a color camera/monitor/night vision/and audio it's great investment. Later when they are older, I can use it anywhere in the house."
1,Amazon Sends USED cams,Watch out! I paid for a NEW Mobicam from Amazon and received a USED unit. The seal had already been opened on the packaging and the units inside were clearly quite old and used (lots of wear and tear). Be careful about buying online from Amazon!!!!
2,Decent....while it lasts,"This was our second video baby monitor. Based on many of the reviews that I had read, I was a little concerned about it interfering with our wireless network, but that never became a problem. The first camera that I bought turned out to be a bit of a dud. While it was functional, the picture was never sharp. I returned the unit to the manufacturer and they happily replaced it with a new one. All was well until about 10 months later, when the system completely died. I have no idea what happened, and of course, the manufacturer's warranty was only for 90 days. So here I am again, back in the market for a video monitor. Maybe I just have bad luck and got another dud from Mobi? But then again, maybe they're all duds."
1,AC stops working after warranty,"The camera worked fine for us and we did not have a static problem unless we were over 30' and outside a concrete wall. The big disappointment with this camera for us was that AC adapter stopped working after the warranty time ran out. I am not talking about the cord (they stopped working at one point as well but the company replaced those) but the spot where the cord plugs in. Very disappointing in the quality of this product, there is no reason this area should fail other than substandard manufacturing practices and the company will not stand behind it."
1,Where was the FCC on this product?,"This product was perfect for us. Having a color video with night-vision is awesome. Saves you trips up and down the stairs, and lets you see what the baby is doing without having to peek in their rooms.However, the reception on these is not great. They interfere with everything wireless. The camera killed my wifi, and even changing channels on both didn't help. I had to move my wifi around. Everything from wifi, cordless phones, cellphones and especially bluetooth create massively annoying static.I hope to find a better product by my next child, because when they work properly they are very convenient.I will admit that I am a gadget freak and probably didn't have room for one more 2.4GHz wifi device in my house."
1,DO NOT BUY,This thing is terrible you'd be better off using your own ears you can not go any where in the house with it. it works best about 20ft away but still has static and a fuzzy picture. Don't waste time spend the extra money and getr something better you'll end up buying something new within a week any ways plus with the static you won't be able to sleep. The only thing good about this item is the night vision.
2,mobi cam and outdoor,"IMHO- don't do it unless you live in a 2 room house. the outdoor cam is weak and doesn't do night vision as advertised. the ReCam software is not responsive to motion. if you are going to use it between bedrooms it might be ok, but we got it for outdoor surveillance and are Very Disappointed. the outdoor cam is NOT WIRELESS and it doesn't pass thru 3 walls. Take care and learn from my mistake. I really wanted to like this system. I contacted getmobi directly and they didn't want to help me."
4,works for me,"I don't understand all the static issues but it works fine at my house. Like most homes, I also have cordless phones and wi-fi internet connection and the mobicam works like it should. I give it 4-stars only cuz I wish the screen were bigger. But overall, I'm satisfied with my purchase."
3,Big problem with all wireless devices,"Hi we got ths monitor as a gift for our son it is cool, but...the monitor screen is small but it is not a problem we have wireless conection in our house and we have 2.4 GHz phones. As soon as you bring the monitor near any of that devices it starts showing white lines across the screen and make noises. So you almost imposibble to hear the baby or to see anything clear. otherwise it is Ok."
3,beware of interference,"I have not tried another monitor yet so I don't have much to compair it to. The monitor worked fine in the house but when I went outside, no more than 200 feet away, there was only sound and a grainy, unreadable picture. The instructions state that the camera/lcd should work up to 300 feet depending on obstructions. It didn't. I do live in an area where airplanes fly overhead on occasion, so there may be some interference from that."
1,Great Concept but item flawed,"I was so excited to find this monitor and after reading the reviews thought it was going to be great!! However, once I recieved the monitor and tried it at home, I relized that I was not so lucky after all. The picture and sound was incredible. The night vision was unreal.. however there was this white line that went thru the picture continuously and caused a static sound. I tried it at several locations in the house and all had the same result. So now I am on the search again."
1,Static Static Static,"After unplugging my wireless router the video receiver continued to provide levels of static (noise) that make performance unacceptable. I'm not planning on unplugging my phone so I can watch my sleepiong child on video - may as well move to the boonies! Video is nice however without the audio, it's not worth the cash. This product is generation 1 - review again when you have your next round of babies in 2008."
1,Don't buying this product!,I only used the monitor 5 days... and monitor doesn't work everday [just some time]!
3,Doesn't work with a Wireless Network,I was really looking forward to having a monitor so I could see my son at night. When I started using it the monitor had lines running through the picture and I couldn't hear anything. The manufacturer said that it doesn't work when you have a wireless network. I was really disappointed so I sent it back. I bought the Handheld Color Video Monitor by Summer Infant. It works great with my wireless network and my 2.4 Ghz phones. It doesn't work very good with other 900Mhz phones or controls according to the manual.
1,Does not work with wireless network,"The Mobicam will not work with your wireless network - channels 1 & 2 were hard to get on the screen due to interference. Channel 3 came in great....but brought our network to a screeching halt.Also, to use the night vision, you have to go in and flick a switch on the camera....it doesn't automatically switch to night vision. Pretty inconvenient, we returned our mobicams and are just back to the audio monitor....working well too!"
5,great service,there service was really good. i recommend them for any book needs you may have. even though it wasnt the book i needed they kept in touch and were very helpful.
1,Terrible,I still have not received my textbook. I ordered this in January and need it for an online class.
3,the book was okay,the cover wasnt in great shape but it was okay not that bad... what i didnt like it was that i could trace the shipment...
1,This seller is a liar,"Ok, so I ordered this book from the seller, and it said ""like new"" the book is nowhere near even ""good"" condition! It was all taped up and banged up. I'm very upset with this seller, I'm not getting any replies from them either, just BE CAREFUL, you'll probably NOT get what they describe you'll be getting."
1,"The American Promise, Volumn II",I ordered Volumn II and received volumn I. Time was short (only 3 days before my class started) so I had to order a new one from the college supplier and had to pay for 2 day shipping which added $27.00 to my price ($165.00) Not happy with this purchase.
3,"The book is great, but it's bait-and-switch on the trade-in","I ordered this book for my college sophomore through the Amazon buy/trade-in program. Because the text was $152. at the time of purchase with a $94. trade-in value, I chose Amazon to provide it. I could have rented it from Chegg or another textbook rental company for about $70. Today I tried to trade the book in...and the total amount of trade-in value I could receive was $18.50 with the ISBN on the cover of this textbook. I am furious that Amazon would treat loyal customers this way and I will never purchase a textbook from this site again. There are too many other reputable companies giving students (and their overburdened parents) a break on textbooks now for me to risk the bait-and-switch tactic Amazon demonstrated."
3,Never opened the book,"Bought this for a class, never used it. Had awesome table neighbors that understood the class and let me use their notes."
5,full tracks,1. La Misma Espina~~~2. Fue Por Una Cerveza~~~3. Basta Ya~~~4. Yo Te Perdono~~~5. Te Llevo Dentro de Mi~~~6. Sin Ti~~~7. Y Voy A Ser Feliz~~~8. Raices~~~9. Vete Con El~~~10.

2,WTA DISAPPOINTMENT,"I am so disappointed in the game. I am an absolute tennis nut & have probably every tennis game ever made. This game, in my opinion, is very unrealistic!! The graphics are horrible. You can't even tell who you're playing with if it weren't for the name being posted. You certainly don't have any idea who you're playing against by looking at the player across the net!To me, the game play is very suspect also! You think you've hit a ""winning"" shot (if you want to call it that), but it's out. I honestly think that your shot is going to go where the software puts it!The announcers are very annoying. Also, is there any reason why they have to show a replay after every shot??I just find the whole game annoying.These games are so expensive..............come on, Nintendo, don't put out this junk!"
3,Too short.,"Nice quality, but too short and I'm only 5' 7"". You really need to wear knee high military type socks with these. Hanes calf sock are too short."
2,Rothco quality control is problematic.,"Been using a variety of shirt stays for the last 6 months. I had a set of rothco stirrups for a few weeks without incident, then one broke on me. The rubber wedge that mashes the shirt between the steel loop falls off. You can put it back yourself but the retention is never the same. The rubber isn't strong enough to hold your shirt snug, and it isn't molded with deep enough crevices to make the shirt and steel stay put. Now the symptoms I just listed above did not occur until after about a month. With the last two orders I've had, they break in about a week... So the quality control and overall design is not very good.I've been using a new brand: Premiere. I don't know if they are available here on amazon, but I have found them at multiple uniform shops and they are much better, and more functional than these."
2,"Not for those above 5'10""","This product has no value to anyone 6'0"" and above. Simply not enough material to properly connect. I would not recommend this product unless you are > 6'0""."
2,Poorly made. But good value for the money.,"After one wear, The seams are coming apart. Luckily my wife is a master of the sewing machine. Once she reinforces all the seams, I think it will be A+But when you buy a product like this, that extra step should be unecessary :( And for that, they earn a 2 on the star ratings.However, on day one of wear, I felt so GQ. My shirt stayed tucked PERFECTLY and my socks stayed up all day. Do you know what that will do for you throuhgout the day, not having to tuck in your shirt or pull up your socks 10+ times a day to stay feeling sharp?"
2,It fits pretty tight but it works with longer shirts,"Maybe the picture makes me think it'll be bigger but it's only about 12"" long. It stretches but I'm 6'2"" and wear 34/34 pants. If I was wearing a longer dress shirt it worked fine but if I wore a dress shirt that didn't hang past my torso it was way too tight to wear. I tried it with a few shirts and then stopped wearing it. If the elastic side was 6"" longer I think it would fit much better."
1,"Wow, way too short!!","I bought these because they were the style that I love to wear in uniform, but holy cow! They were waaaaaaaay too short! I adjusted them all the way to make them as long as possible but it still wasn't long enough. They'd constantly snap off and hit my leg and boy, does that hurt! Definitely made for short people."
3,Good for basic use,"I wear my shirt-stays every day at work. These are very good but my only complaint is that the rear ones tend to come off easily. Perhaps its because I sit on them in the patrol car but at least once a shift, the rear ones snap & disconnect from my shirt. The front ones never come off however and so I've resorted to wearing them only in the front. If you don't sit down during your shift or you just need to use them for an interview or other dress-up event, they're great."
1,Poor Quality,The adjustment clamp broke on all 4 stays before I attached them to the shirt. Do not purchase!!!!!!! I usually buy the black stays but was going to try the white ones. I would have given no stars if it was an option.
2,not for tall guys,i wish they had a little more room for taller guys....these cut into my legs as I walked - way too tight and I had them as loose as I could get them
1,Extremely poor quality,"I've used shirt stays of all different types for well over a decade now. These were by far the worst. These were so bad that I was unable to use them even once. I opened the package and affixed them to the bottom of the dress shirt I planned on wearing that day, put the shirt on and reached for the stirrup loops to place around my feet. As soon as a slight amount of pressure was applied to the stirrups, the stitching came completely undone and rendered the shirt stays useless. It took so little pressure to cause the stitching to come undone that the stirrups didn't even make it to my feet. All it took was the pressure of my hand pulling slightly on them to completely unravel. Extremely poor quality..."
1,Worst shirt stays ever.,I have to wear these for work. These were the worst ones I've ever bought. I'll stick to military stores that sell quality ones.
2,shirt stays for short folks,These products are according to photo what I want. Upon a timely arrival and easy purchase I was disappointed to find that when adjusted out fully they do not fit well. I am <6' tall and I would consider that average. When sitting down they were hard to stretch to fit and standing they do not want to stay together. I had to cut them and have material sewn in between to lengthen so that they were comfortable.
2,Low quality and bad design,I used these stays a hand full of times and they actually hurt my knees have wearing them for 12 hours. Not to mention they didn't keep the shirt has tight as I would have preferred.I thought the stirrup would work great so that my socks wouldn't be pulled up but the stays that clip on the socks work 100% better I'd recommend buying those instead.
2,Plastic Fastener Deforms after a couple weeks,The plastic fastener on the straight version deforms after a limited amount wear. This causes the hold the device has on the shirt to be much weaker. These things constantly slip and snap now.
3,"works, but you will need to replace them soon.",I am rather vain and obsessive about how my shirt looks. after four months or so I'm looking to get more. I would recommend getting the alligator sort of clips.
1,poor quality,These are poor quality shirt stays that constantly break and are not strong enough to do the job. Buy Vanguard instead
5,Pretty Useful,"Use it for the Air Force and works very well. Glad I bought them, recommended for others who need to keep their shirts tucked in."
3,"Nice and cheap, You get what you pay for","Luckily the straps are very flexible, because they aren't very tall. I am 6'3"", and most of my height is in my legs. They are absolutely maxed out, and they are still a little tighter than they should be. After a couple of weeks, one of the hooks came off. However, it was an easy fix."
2,Couldn't attach to socks,"My biggest problem with these, even though I'd really like to like them, is that I couldn't attach them to my socks (I bought the non-stirrup version)--obviously a very big problem with this product. While I had no problem with the length (I'm 6'3"") and no problem with attaching them to my shirt, I found it impossible, even after trying them on my thinnest dress socks and multiple different ways, to get them to attach, thus rendering them useless. Maybe I'm doing something wrong, but I can't think of any other possible way to do it if I am. A potentially fantastic product that I just can't use."
1,Wont Stay put,Im a deputy and have had these straps on now for 2hr and 45 min. 15 min ago I was sitting here at the computer and one of them popped off my shirt. I then went to secure same and the other side rear popped off. Then it was like a game of back and forth . The clips got too soft or something and neither side would stay put. As soon as I got one secure and moved to the other that one would pop right back off. Verry anoying seeing as it is the begining of my day and I will have to be hasseled with my shirt coming untucked all day... SMH. Should of sticked to what I know.
2,Broke on third day,"Clasps broke on third day of use. I will not pretend that there is not a possibility of inexperienced use here, but the part that failed seemed like the most unlikely to fail in the mechanism. Of the alternatives, however, they seem like they would be solid by comparison when used best."
5,My Favorite Accessory,"These things make all the difference. If you want to look good in a dress shirt, you need stays. These have held up really well for me under pretty heavy use (about 3-4 days/wk and 14 hrs/day). The ""button"" part that goes through the clasp is a plastic/rubber?? that seems to be losing the ridge that holds it in the loop. But at 8 dollars a set I am ok with buying 2 sets per year given my heavy use.Just kind of a weird side note, I'm not an old guy and was kind of worried, like some others might be, about how you look to a woman with these things in ""certain situations"". Gotta say, the response from women has generally been ""wow I'm impressed, you even have the garter things for your shirt"". Just thought I'd throw that out there given what I read in some reviews before buying these."
3,Decent for price,"Overall they work, every once in a while the end hooked to the shirt pops off. I use a safety pin with the clasp for reassurance. Nothing worse than a shirt stay hanging out of your pant leg during something important. That's my only qualm"
5,Look good everyday!!,"A friend who is in the army told me about these, and I love them. They will keep your shirt tucked in, and looking nice and clean."
1,not so good,"These shirt stays do not stay hooked, especially if you carry a wallet in your back pocket. Not satisfied."
1,Simply awful,I recently purchased this product. I wore them exactly twice before they drove me completely crazy. The cheap nylon buttons they used did not secure the shirt stay to either my shirt tail or my sock. The third time I tried to use this product it ripped my shirt. Furthermore the nylon bands they used frayed after two uses. They have been destroyed and discarded.
1,Very un happy,I received them in a timely manor however they did not hold up. Both straps broke within seven (7) days and are now worthless to me!
4,Stay Pairs,"I've had these for weeks now and I must say I'm impressed. Very durable, comfortable and easy to use. All in all a good purchase for the price."
1,wont stay on shirt,These are not very good compared to some I have used in the past. They do not stay clipped to the shirt and that iritates me when I feel it come off and my shirt come up!
5,Relaxed,"Having been in the military and trying the stays that latch on to your socks, I must say these are a welcome. No they do not hold up the socks but I do welcome the fact that if a slip happens I wont be getting a terrible surprise. They get the job done and some coworkers even complimented on the results. Now more of them have decided to give it a try. No slip ups yet but even if it does happen I can rest easy with these. At the price they are going for here online is a steal. I have looked for them all over the city but only specialty stores carry them and they charge at least three times the cost of just ordering them here."
2,Clips not secure.,"The clips on these stays do not hold well given my activity level; I spend more time per day re-clipping them than I would simply re-tucking my shirt. My job (IT) requires me to to a lot of walking, lifting, and squatting and throughout the day the clips would just come undone. When the clips are working the stays work well. Perhaps someone with a less active job would find them more reliable."
2,Unconfortable,"The shirt stays are almost too short. They are made of a plastic/fire ant blend making them extremely itchy and irritating. They do their job, but I am going to get new ones that aren't uncomfortable."
1,Upset,"I am really upset with the Mr.Coffee maker that I purchased...It is the programmable clock 12 cup coffee maker in white, and have never had such a problem like I have had with this one...if you don't get the coffee pot just right, it runs over, and this has happened to me 6 times now....and now the coffee pot won't work, I think the water got into the digital timer and it quit working, and paying such a price for a coffee pot that was suppose to be the best in its line...is a hoax....I am very dissatisfied with it...."
3,Flimsy...broke when opening package,"This thing broke when I was opening the plastic bag that it comes in. Unfortunately, no one makes anything like this, so you have no other options. I used Gorilla Glue to mend it, which was less hassle than going through the return process. The bracket pieces are made of plastic, and the trim is thin twistable plastic. Very cheap stuff. I had to file down several places so everything was smooth. There was excess plastic and bumps like you would get when making a model airplane or something. It didnt even sit flush on the stereo, so when you push the trim it goes in like 1/4-1/2"". Fortunately, once you put everything together and put the console trim on you can't see all the flaws, so it looks like its not even there, just black surrounding the stereo. This was on a JVC KW-NT3HDT in a 2003 Nissan Xterra."
1,Nissan Pathfinder 2001,"This absolutely does nothing for installing a DDIN unit in the Nissan Pathfinder.There are no mounts included. It states you will need to use the existing mounts but this thing doesnt even align up with the stock mounts. It simple provides no value whatsoever.May work for other vehicles. But for a Nissan Pathfinder 2001. It DOES NOT WORK, even though it is listed."
1,worthless,Is not an installation kit. Trim piece at best. I had to modify the stock brackets and then i used the trim pieces that came with my reviever. This kit is a complete waste of money.
1,not an installation kit!,"waste of money. luckley amazon is awesome and refunded my money without me having to even send it back. all this is is just a trim. what i am assuming to be the bracket that comes with it is made out of plastic and seems worthless. and the trim that came with the radio fit and looked better than the one supplied with this ""kit""now that i dont have to return it, it is going where it belongs, the trash"
5,This Album is ACE!!!!!!!!!!!,"This album is so good, i love every single track. It's clearly the best ska-p album by far and will get you dancin' in no time! If you like yer ska, mixed with a bit of punk, reggae, trad this will be perfect! Seriously a great 5 star album"
4,Dessert,"I spent a long time waiting for Whipsmart, and this EP felt like dessert after a tasty dinner. It's always nice to get more Liz. She's a talented singer/songwriter not in the tedious-overly introspective-I take myself and my ovaries too seriously-female singer songwriter mold, though she's taken a turn toward that with her most recent album, Whitechocolatespacegg. That said, this is a good album. You can certainly find umpteen dozen copies of girlysounds(the four track stuff Liz did in her apartment before Exile in Guyville) all over the internet, but for those of us committed, yet not obsessive fans, this is enough of that sound.I'm absolutely crazy about Animal Girl, Turning Japanese and Dead Shark. She's talented. This is just more(and less refined) proof."
4,Early Phair surpasses fair,"I don't know why this disc got slammed so much. Liz Phair is hard to listen to for some, but for the ones who get what she is saying it shouldn't be. The charm in this ep is the 5 girlysound selections. The only other way to find Girlysound material (on cd) is the ""Secretly Timid"" bootleg, and that is really hard to find (if you do, tell me!) The cuts on here are somewhat weak in certain areas but a song like ""Easy"" in all its sparsity and truthfulness cut through the sludge and show why Liz Phair is such an insightful musical entity."
3,4 stars if you're a true fan or feeling experimental,"This is raw, unvarnished Liz, a collection of odd bits of proto-Liz. Some tracks here are genuinely forgettable, but others should make it onto an full-length release. ""Dead Shark"" and ""Easy"" are brilliant!"
4,The Baby Loves It,"I'm not really sure why, but my baby loves to play with balls of all different kinds. We ordered this one to have at Grandma's house and he loves playing with it. He's 9 months old and has developed the game of ""throw the toy then crawl after it."" Balls, apparently, are especially good for this game, because they roll away. The gertie ball is great because it has a grippy texture, so he can easily grab on to it. Plus, he loves to chew on the nobbies once he gets it.We do need to make sure the dog stays away from it, however, since I'm pretty sure he'd make quick work of it. Underinflating it a little helps, but I don't think it would withstand the jaws of most dogs."
4,fun ... for ALL ages...,"Whether a toddler or a teenager, this ball is fun and safe to use in the house.... just watch out for the dog!"
3,Fun but they don't last long.,I love the concept of the Nobbie Gertie Ball. They are fun and kids can grip and catch them easily. We have gone through 3 of the nobbie/bumpy gertie balls in the past 2 years. I have 2 girls and we only use them in the house but for some reason they keep deflating. We always find holes in them after a few months. I have since moved on to the Tangiball sold by Discovery Toys. It's a firm ball that won't pop and it has the bumps on it. I've had it for a few months and so far so good.
5,Easy-To-Understand Language,"Many tax books are written over the average American's heads. But that is not the cause with 101 Tax Saving Ideas. The author go to great lengths to make sure each tip is easy to understand and beneficial. Each tip is geared towards helping middle-class families, small home businesses, and retired folks save money on their year-end taxes. I especially liked the examples to better explain the tips."
4,Nice and simple,"This mount was easy to install. All the screws were labelled and easy to ID. It is a simple mount, but it does the job well. I would buy it again."
2,broken,"very nice looking and tasting product, except fully 3/4 arrived broken, both layers, and doesn't look too good, as if someone's been nibbling on what you're putting out for tea; came amply bubble-packed in box, so i'd guess problem is inside the tin; just can't be shipped without breaking"
4,Good RCA Component Cables but a bit lose.,These are a great price for a single set of RCA Component double shielded cables. The only thing that stood out was some of the connector ends are not a tight fit on my TV and DVD player. They slide in nicely but can fall out if jiggled.
3,Bristles-lite,"The brush looks like and is similarly constructed in the same manner as they have been for years - probably all by the same manufacturer. I actually use mine for scrubbing only my back, so the first thing I do is take carpenters glue and make sure the handle is firmly attached. Once that is done, the only question of quality is the firmness of the bristles. Since these are natural bristles, the water affects the firmness, and that is to be expected. However, after using these brushes for several years, I am coming to the belief that the manufacturer is packing fewer bristles per brush, and the effect is rather disappointing. They are less firm, and respond more like a painters brush, than a dense natural brush.The service by the vendor was expedient and meets the high-quality that we have come to expect from vendors associated with Amazon."
2,"""Detachable"" should be ""unattachable"" - otherwise a good brush.","I ordered this because I liked the fact that it was detachable. When I received it and tried it out, I found that it wasn't just detachable--the brush would not stay on the handle. It just slides together and there is no real way to secure it, so whenever you try to brush with the long handle ""attached,"" the brush just falls off. And sometimes onto your toes.I ended up just supergluing it and calling it a day, but only because I didn't want to deal with returning it. It still works okay, but it's not really what I wanted.The brush itself is fine."
2,Actual product varies significantly,"I've ordered two of these through Amazon, the first a number of months ago was great and looked like the picture and matched the positive reviews, i.e., well-made with stiff bristles. The last I just received is an entirely different brush, with a handle and head that don't come close to fitting together, seemingly extremely cheaply made of glued together bits of scrap wood, and with very soft bristles.Given the variation in others' reviews and this experience, I'd say what is sent may be great or may be utterly useless."
3,Detachable Head Back Brush,Overall I like this brush! The size and shape of both the brush and handle are good. I also like the fact that the brush can be removed from the handle so it is not limited to just my back. The only complaint I have is the bristles are too soft and wear out quickly.
3,Brush OK,"The brush on this product is fine. But do not expect the handle to stay on. It will not happen. I do enjoy using the brush without the handle. I use the brush dry, not wet. Bristles are just the right amount of stiffness for this use."
1,back brush,"Brush handle did not fit properly into brush head. Bristles came out after one use, so it had to be thrown away. Poor quality all around."
1,Bristles fall out at every use - lots of them,I have used this three times and each time a substantial number of bristles have come out leaving parts of it bare and my shower a mess. I would not purchase from this seller again. Very shoddy product.
1,Worthless,"I ordered this brush because I am physically handicapped and I need to reach parts of body that I cannot reach without a handle. When I got it in the mail, I opened the package, and started to use it. In less than 3 seconds, the handle separated from the brush. I could not attach it. I know the handle slips on and off of the brush, but this handle will not slip back on. Therefore, it is useless to me. I have spend good money to get nothing in return. I am extremely disappointed and I highly doubt that I will ever buy anything from you again. I have bought this same brush from other companies and it was not as cheaply made as yours and I was satisfied with it."
1,Worn out after two months,"I have been using this brush for about two months as a bath brush, and the bristles in the center have now lost their rigidity, and are matted down. The brush can no longer hold soap well, so it is no longer of any use."
3,handle wont come off.,"I wanted just the brush part and figured I could just remove the handle, but it is glues on very tightly."
2,"Good brush, bad attachment.","The bristles on this brush are nice. The detachable arm is useless. The brush never stays on the attachment. So, I just threw it away."
2,be careful,"Be careful when using this pan, as the recipe they gave, and the timing, ended up with stuck cakes.You need to check the cakes at 25-30 min and you need some spray or butter in the pan to prevent it stickingDid not find this pan to be non-stick. Spent an hr getting rid of cake parts and crumbs with suggested cooking time of 35 min. And my oven was right on at 350 temp."
3,The cover caught me again..,I know I have picked this book up before..in the paperback form and at least twice in the hardcover edition. Parts of this memoir were very good and toward the middle it really starts to get long winded. Don't judge a book by it's hard or soft cover like I did and it left me empty. Not much new material here. I will do a google search and see if Christina is still alive or not. The paperback came out in 1998.
