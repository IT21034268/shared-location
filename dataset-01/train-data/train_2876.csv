4,A moving and unpredictable pleasure,"""Piece of April"" charms by never falling into a rut and delivering what most American films are supposed to deliver--tidy and preprocessed emotional ""moments."" Not to say the film isn't moving and powerful in its own way, especially Patricia Clarkson's performance as a mother who just can't stand her daughter. Nice in that it also captures something like the real New York, continents away from the phony sets of ""Friends,"" with cramped apartments, wacked-out neighbors and the occasional threat of violence. The weakest link is sadly Katie Holmes, who is just too white-bread to play a Northeasterner, even a slumming suburban gal. She's appealing though, so the whole thing ends up working somehow."
1,Ummmm...,After I bought this dvd I was really excited but when I watched it I was really disapointed. I couldnt even get through it I dont think I even got through half of it. I took it back to hastings where I bought it as soon as I could.
1,IT SUCKED!!,"I concur with another reviewer that this movie was not very good at all. I was so bored and the cinematography was terrible, with unsteady cameras and the like. It was a royal waste of my time and the only reason I kept watching was because I was SURE it was going to get better, but the only good thing was the snapshots at the end where her mother decides to come after all."
2,Piece of @#$%!,"Really bad indie flick made by the writer of ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape."" Has one of the worst performances by Oliver Platt I have ever seen. What is the deal with Clarkson being nominated for this? I like her normally but she was really off in this one. Sean Hayes is officially one of the worst actors ever(I have never liked him on Will and Grace and he is frighteningly bad in this.) It isn't even that interestingly shot (i.e. digital video). The best things about the movie which make it ""somewhat"" worthwhile are the engaging and dynamic performances by Derek Luke, Katie Holmes and the actress playing the grandmother."
1,Terrible,"This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The plot is so incredibly stupid and boring, this was a complete waste of my time. The camera angles are bad, sometimes shaking. Please save yourself the agony."
1,Out of date software,"While Army Builder is a fantastic program, this version is out of date and is no longer supported. I would not recommend buying this product unless you simply want to collect it. It is worthless otherwise."
2,Buckle awkward and uncomfortable,I returned this watch because I thought the buckle on the band was both awkward and uncomfortalbe. I then bought another Eco-drive watch which has worked out for me.
2,Of couse it's bad BUT,"It's great fun to watch! Everything about this is wrong -- te story of Salome is changed to make Salome a victim of her evil mother Herodias. Rita Hayworth looks more like 1950's Hollywood -- complete with gold hair, -- than a first century Jewish-Mediterrenean princess. But the prize for giving the most unintended laughs goes to John the Baptist in the hammiest, most overacted role ever in ANY Biblical film -- and indeed Hollywood has dozens of overacted Biblical films them. This film is enjoyable, pure kitschy entertainment - don't expect any deep theological interpretations of the Gospel account. Don't even expect an accurate interpretation."
2,Big budget doesn't always mean quality,"This is another one of those big-budget, all-star cast biblical films made back in the fifties. This one here really isn't worth watching. The screenplay is adulterated and doesn't really follow the New Testament in the description of John the Baptist's life and teachings. As with most other biblical movies, it suffers from overacting from many of its stars and especially from Alan Badel (John the Baptist). The video versions aren't any different from TV viewings except that there won't be any commercials in the videocassette."
4,A dance you'll never forget!,"Rita Hayworth was breathtakingly beautiful, and her Dance of the Seven Veils is one of the most erotic scenes I've ever witnessed in a mainstream film. Plus, Charles Laughton and Judith Anderson are always fun to watch.This film has lush settings, and it's certainly enjoyable viewing."
5,If you have a fluke get the case,If you going to bother getting a nice meter you might as well get a nice case. This one holds my 113 nicely and serves as good protection if it gets banged around a bit.
2,These Classic Songs Deserve Way Better,"It's too bad -- but the best thing that can be said about this Cd is: ""at least it's cheap"". These remixes are so far removed from the tight elegance of the originals they become nothing more than passable background music. 9 of the 10 mixes are credited to either Julian Synne or Julian Beeston who seem to have lifted the vocals from the Sister's concert album (rather than Edwards and Rodgers meticulous studio recordings). The production sounds sloppy, busy, and usually grabs nothing more than snippets of the original vocals. If you're a Sister Sledge fan, try finding the series of 1993 cd singles released for ""We Are Family"", ""Lost In Music"", and ""Thinking of You"" remixed by Sure Is Pure, Ramp, and Philip Kelsey -- all wonderful and faithful to the original versions. The saddest part of this whole mess: there are STILL no slammin' remixes of the camp classic ""He's The Greatest Dancer"". Damn!"
2,monster magnet on prozac,well i love monster magnet have all there cd's and this just seems unorginal. no great wacked out lycrics no great sound. only song that sounds semi MM is kiss of the scorpion .this record just sounds like everything else out there. B L A N D ! ! !
5,Love it,"These guys rock, I have been a fan of theirs since the beginning and I love all there CDs, this one while not there best is dam good. They tend on a song or two hear to go bluesy; and on a song or two acid rockish; but over all this CD pounds, like old Black Sabbath and Grand Funk Railroad (two obvious influences). They are the best band since the early 70s along with Alice in Chains and Mettalica."
4,Impressive,"I first got into Monster Magnet with Powertrip, and have been hooked ever since. I am a huge fan of Dopes to Infinity, and I love Spine of God, as well. The tone of this CD is more in line with the tone of Powertrip than Dopes to Infinity or Spine of God, but it is excellent nonetheless. This disc is definitely mellower than their work generally is, and while that may turn off some fans, I find it to be an excellent work."
4,Great for all Monster Magnet fans,"This cd is certainly not a waste of time if you are a real and I mean real Monster Magnet fan. But if you are a ""just starting to be"" fan of Monster Magnet, I suggest that you listen to some of their previous cd's rather than jumping in the cold ice water of this cd stark naked. But hey if you feel like taking it there be my guest."
2,Stay gold Ponyboy,"I'm a long time fan of these guys and I thank them for countless headtrips and stories I tell to this day. Naturally, a new album is something to look forward to. In this case, I knew it was okay to wait.God Says No, seems far too much like an exercise in ""we have to keep doing this"" mode. You could almost smell it on the last release until you got to Bummer and Atomic Clock. It must be damned near impossible to maintain the space-drugs-gods influenced vehemence that have made them so amazing over the years. With this release, they've come back to earth. If you're new to these guys, Spine of God will remain the favorite go from there . . .On a postive note, check out Atomic Bitchwax for an earthy version of what Magnet sacrifices for sound effects. Ed Mundell seems to have a great time lashing out great stoner metal licks and odds are good that you'll enjoy the ride as well!"
3,Not their best work,"As a longtime Monster Magnet fan, it is very tough to write a less than brilliant review of a new MM disc. However, ""God Says No"" is simply not up to par with this band's previous work. The first few songs are quite good, ""Melt"" and ""Doomsday"" in particular, but from there, it sort of sinks into (and this is a word i NEVER imagined i'd apply to MM) generic hard rock. There isn't anything bad about most of the tracks, but there is none of the spark and originality from previous MM records. In addition, I have to object to the re-recording of ""Medicine"" which first appeared on 1992's brilliant ""Spine of God."" Monster Magnet is still one of the best hard rock bands of the last 10 years, and I certainly think there are worse ways to spend 15 bucks, but if you are a die hard Monster Magnet fan, I think you'll be disappointed with ""God Says No""."
2,Ok for the money. Color not as appears.,"This is ok for the price paid. It does not stay tight with having just the slide adjuster. The metal slide adjuster also sticks out farther than I would like - almost 1/2"" off my wrist. Also, the color is a much redder brown than shown - both the dial and the band. The indiglo is nice and the face is easy to read. It is light-weight and easy to slide on and off. But, it does get dirty easily. It is a nice concept, but needs some work."
2,Basically a pulp romance novel,"Big disappointment--this story is primarily based on the sexual coming of age of a weaver/spinner and her crossbow archer prince within a specific historical context. The spinning and weaving is mostly a framework to string the reader along through the detailed exposition of budding romance (including gratuitous sex scenes) and violent conflicts that mark their journey. As a spinner and weaver, I expected alot more exposition on textiles from this story. The conclusion is also sadly anticlimactic."
2,Dated Financial Advice,"While a very useful book about how to save money and retire early, the financial information is rather dated, especially concerning today's high-ticket items such as health insurance."
5,Excellent book,It's an easy read from someone with a short attention span. Plain english; a story that just takes you in. I am grateful to Larry for writing this book and sharing that this alternate lifestyle is possible.It's encouraging me to save more.
3,So. so.,"The book somewhat went on and on and on telling the same thing over and over and over. I realized that Ann and Becca had some huge hurdles. I thought Ann was very harsh regarding her mother at times. Having a severely handicapped child myself, and also having to do paper routes, etc, never owning a house, etc, etc....I felt like Ann wrote like she was the ONLY person alive who had ever worked so hard. We all work hard in different areas of life. I consider everything I have a gift from God. My husband and I have never been on food stamps, etc, not that there is anything wrong with that. Ann seemed to put herself above others."
5,A TRUE INSPIRATION TO ALL!!,"I purchased this book by Ann Yurcek as soon as it was published. It was the BEST and most inspiring moment for myself and family. I cannot express enough how grateful I am to Ann for writing this book, for the determination, the faith, hope and belief she needed to have for her Tiny Titan and the rest of her family. For standing by her husbands side and letting him find his way -- when the world was crashing down around her. As a mom to a daughter who has been diagnosed with Noonan Syndrome I read the Tiny Titan as my 8 month old underwent Open Heart Surgery. Thank you Ann Yurcek for helping me find my inner strength at a moment when my baby needed me to be strong for her!!!"
1,Not working,This pump was mailed to me the first time missing a valve cover screw on tip. I returned it and another one was mailed to me that leaks air around the pressure gauge. I mailed the second one back but haven't received a replacement.
1,very bad!!!,"the pump was used,and old( i paid for a new one ),it was scrathed,andnot working.i am very dissatified with this product,and the dealer."
3,nice pump / wrong color,I bought Steeler Black and Gold... got 49ner red. But the pump works ok and not worth the hassle of returning. Good deal for the price....kids are using for water rockets!
2,one tube too old,I cannot find this in Ulta stores any longer. One tube was great. The other was old and dried out.
1,pur minerals-mineral shea butter lipstick-burnished gold,"I was looking for to try this lipstick, but when I received it, I was very disappointed ,it was rancid, had a horrible smell, it must have been very old.I had to trash it! What a waste of money!!!"
2,Not impressed,"I bought the frosted amber and it is very sheer with a hint or orange to it. Not what I was hoping for, not worth the price."
2,Some shining moments,"I really like Joy Electric, but as an overall release this is not thier best. My biggest problem with it is that many of the vocals are out of tune on the sharp side. Ronnie Martin's vocals have gotten quite a bit better in newer releases. There are two outstanding cuts here, ""Monosynth"" which may be there best song & ""Forever is a place""."
5,"Awesome, as usual!","Contrary to what one person said in these reviews, Joy Electric is one of the most imaginative bands ever. Their music is, in my opinion, far greater than any other synth band. Each song has its own tune, and they don't sound alike. I really don't like much upbeat music, but I absolutely love Joy Electric!"
1,Completely unlistenable.,"If this is the face of Christian ""electronica"" then we've got a long way to go. Nothing more than a pale imitation of early Aphex Twin for the middle school youth group crowd. Has anyone noticed that every Joy Elecric song sounds the same? Let's hope their Plastiqmusiq label can find some artists with some real imagination."
3,Happy Happy Happy Happy Happy and repetative...,"Not the best, but still happy and fun, and still repetative, but not as bad as the up-and-coming, ""Children of the Lord"" which seems to go on-and-on-and-on-and-on......"
3,Poorly formatted for Kindle,"Even the best publishers can be careless about formatting their texts for Kindle. This excellent selection of Aristotle's works is a case in point. The table of contents links only to the major categories of Aristotle's specific works, and lines of text do not wrap as they should."
4,yay for Ackrill,"the summaries in each section made this book a life saver! In contrast to other Aristotle books, this one spells out what Aristotle tended to shroud in difficult prose."
3,dry and hard,The power was dry and hard once I received it making it much harder to spoon out of the bottle. Otherswise I use for recovery purposes
1,This Album ...!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This is the worst album ever!!!!!! Also the worst band ever!!!!! This album is not at all punk and not at all emo!!!!! It needs it own musical classification!!!!! ...
2,Cann't remember it!,"jLooked forward to its arrival, but just couldn't get in to it. Maybe because these are relatively unknown people and not all that interesting."
3,Great glove with some nit picks,"Lets start with what I love about this glove...- Great design- ComfortableNow the part I hate about this glove...- Mediocre workmanship, stitches are weak.Personally, this should be priced way cheaper than it appears."
3,Good but weird,"I like the concept, but never gave it as I did not like the wording. Inside it talks about the ""Big Sister"" and her baby. It is not her ""baby"" it is her sibling."
2,two srars,"Too much work to complete. I thought it was a story about being a big sister when I ordered it, not a scrapbook."
1,Really?,"We were looking for a great book to surprise my son with at my upcoming baby shower this weekend. The book just shipped today, with writing already in it. Terrible and misleading."
5,Pefect Book to Creat Memories,"First of all, please note the ""look inside"" option before you purchase. This book does reflect the Christian beliefs and has scripture quoted all throughout it. It also acts as more of a scrapbook/interactive book for kids. There are places for pictures of sister and baby, places for facts about each child.I absolutely love it and so does my daughter, but if you are expecting just something you can read to your kid, this is not the best choice, which is why you should LOOK INSIDE the book before you buy it.If you know what you are buying and you are a Christian household, this is the perfect book to document things and help your daughter get used to the idea of a baby in the house and this baby being part of the family."
1,Don't buy it on kindle,"Useless on Kindle, it's a fill in the blanks book.I agree with a previous review, the description should include the fact that it's a religious book, and for a girl to call her baby brother ""my baby"" is a bit strange."
2,Meh.,"Not really a worthwhile thesaurus. I'm generally disappointed by Webster's reference books, but I went ahead and bought this since it was at a discounted price. In the end, though, I still had to buy a better thesaurus. This one only offers up the usual fare of word choices, things I could have thought up perfectly well on my own."
1,Unsatisfied Customer,"I purchased these socks to keep my feet warm during winter inside and outside. These socks did nothing for me. To make sure I was correct, I wore a regular sock on one foot and the lectra on the other for a time and there was no differance. These are very expensive socks to have them not work. I am returning the socks and I can't even say the rating for this item is one star.Thank you"
2,Heated socks,I was not impressed. They seem to not throw off enough heat. It would have been better if a small type of battery could have been used with the socks as well.
5,At LAST,"At last Australia has produced an artist that can sing and play his instrument without harsh shouting. On top of that, Alex Lloyd has delivered a lyrically outstanding and harmonic album. This guy concentrates on his music not some distant image portrayed to society, and luckily, he has now been exposed for his true talent. His album is amazing, songs like My way home, black the sun, Lucky star etc are fantastic. This album is a must get for any supporter of Australian music or just soft rock, feat excellent guitars remixed with this guys voice. Well done alex."
5,"Melodies, Emotion, and Music","I may not be able to provide an intellectual review, but I can say that this album is great. I enjoy good music in many forms (Monster Magnet, The Tea Party), and this album is great.Lloyd conveys emotion in a powerful way without being overpowering. A great album to really LISTEN to, or to chill out to. I highly recommend it (pity it's an import for all you non-Australians)"
4,The Mallens saga,"Bought this DVD box set after watching the Forsyte Saga. I have always been a fan of Cookson's books and the adaptation of this one was done very well. It is set in nineteenth-century England and has all the things you need in a movie, scandals, love and violence. The Mallens are a cursed family and from one generation to the next they can't escape."
3,Very Colorful book filled with pictures,"This book is filled with pictures detailing the history of chocolate. From when Christopher Columbus first tried chocolate up through making it and enjoying it in the form that we do now is covered. Chocolate was first enjoyed by the native americas as a cold beverage, it wasn't until it had been in Europe for 100 years did we begin to make it into the form that we know and love today.Chocolate is filled with pictures that will make you tongue water. Many chocolate companies were kind enough to show their making process in the book. So perhaps this book is well suited for a younger audience. I am sure you will be the hit of any young person showing this book to them. Even the cover has all sorts of delightful chocolate treats on the cover. There are no recipes in this book, just tasty looking pictures and everything you want to know about chocolate."
4,Good enough to eat...,"Beautiful set of bowls especially when set at the table for 4 or more. The artwork is a decal but naturally it is protected by the glaze of the dish. I would have preferred that the flowers be painted; however, the decals seem to be of high-quality and do look elegant."
5,Excellent Book,"The make-up chapter alone is worth the price of the book. I don't normally wear a lot of make-up, and I couldn't afford to hire a professional for my wedding, but this book was almost like having Mitchell right there. I followed his advice, and was very please with the results.The other chapters were very useful as well. All in all, the best advice he gives is ""Less is more."""
1,Fairly useless if you've got some common sense,"If you've got a brain and some common sense you don't need this book. It was a total waste of money. The only tips that were even partially helpful were the make-up tips, and you can get that information at your department store cosmetic counter (pick your favourite brand, mine's Clinique). If you honestly have NO clue what to do with regard to making wedding choices and can't find the information on the Internet, then go ahead and make the purchase."
3,Good and Bad,"I ordered this kit of the rear and side panels to replace one of my side flaps that got torn. The replacement pieces fit very well and match my original soft top. However the right side panel didn't have the window cut out of the material - hence you couldn't see out. I called and sent back the bad piece. Amazon sent me another full set - with the same quality failure. I've sent back the replacement set and am still waiting for a new right side window panel you can see out of.... Good, that 2 out of 3 pieces work - Bad, the piece I really wanted doesn't work!"
3,Why Minitab and JMP in one book?,"The idea of writing a book about how to use statistical software for six sigma green belts is good, but it should be more focused. If you are not an owner of both Minitab and JMP, 50% of this book is Muda (waste)!"
3,Hard to read?,"I don't know why, but in many cases it seems overly difficult to discern the exit numbers on the freeways."
4,"Older, heavier version of Joy of Cooking","This cookbook has not been revisited for a while and itshows. Recipes tend to be heavier and there is a 50s-ish'technology is superior' attitude that really shows inrespect to pressure cookers and canned foods. The breadthand scope, however is paralleled only by ""Joy of Cooking""in my experience. For the price, it is a very good dealand serves well as a reference cookbook when you'rebrainstorming for what to cook."
5,Preserving American Culture through Cooking and Homemaking,"My wife and I use this book regularly. We appreciate how this book was written in a way that helps the reader see the high calling of a homemaker. Homemaking was once an art and privilege. You will not find many foreign-sounding dishes in this volume. You will however find recipes, table settings, serving instructions, and calendared menus that once made the American home and table a place of warmth and security. This book will thrill those who wish to return to the days that our parents and grand parents enjoyed. No microwave or ""two minute"" recipes here. Plan to make dinner a memorable family affair."
2,"Big, but not fun to cook with","I was excited about an encyclopedic cookbook, but have been disappointed again and again when I couldn't find recipes, or looked up recipes and found that they weren't the least bit authentic. The book also tends to skip to the very basics, often making a dish very bland, difficult to decipher and sometimes not as healthy as if they had put more time into the recipe. I have a library of cookbooks and I highly recommend ""How to Cook Everything"" by Mark Bittman as closer to a true encyclopedic cookbook. Every recipe I've tried in that book has been excellent."
5,"The most comprehensive, easy to follow cookbook I've found.","Everything from how to set a table to how to dress out and butcher a beef or build a root cellar. A most wonderful book, much more than just a cook book- a design for living really."
4,Bought as a gift,"I bought this as a gift, but never had a complainant about damage or skipping. Packaging was not damaged when arrived."
5,Awesome Show,"Love Denis Leary and Rescue Me. This show is top notch! I am extremely impressed with everything about this show from the writing, to the acting, to the stunts, to the casting. I usually don't follow series on TV but someone recommended this show to me and I got hooked from the first episode. Every season so far has been great and Season 5 vol 2 is as good as ever. The only negative is the huge cliffhanger the show leaves off on and now having to wait until June to find out what happens next."
3,Stretching The Story Too Far,"I've always felt that RESCUE ME was one of the best written, directed and acted series on television, but the creators faltered during this 5th Season.There are still some truly memorable moments in many of the episodes. A scene between Andrea Roth and Callie Thorne in the firehouse still brings a smile to my face every time I think about it, as does a sequence with the guys at a supermarket.I think that the problem with this season is that it ran 22 episodes, rather than the usual 13, and the writers/producers did not come up with enough story to fill it. Thus, the plot moves forward at a snail's pace, and there are too many scenes which are just marking time.The season finale is certainly a cliff-hanger.Hopefully, Season 6 will be better.Michael B. Druxman"
4,dog lover's mystery,This book is fairly fast paced. It has a good story line. Dog lovers and mystery lovers may enjoy this quick read.
2,Didn't make sense,"I dearly love mysteries about dog owners, but this one was so boring and clunkily (don't think that's a word) written. What really bothered me is that iit was raining so hard when the heroine found the victim that blood and evidence was washed away and the heroine was soaked to the skin. A few minutes later, the husband of the victim returns after spending time with his young daughter and some pupies in the park, all perfectly dry and happy. Didn't it rain at the park, too?"
1,Just Old Material,"This is just old material repackaged. If you have most of the BTB DVD's, don't buy this one."
5,great little book!,Very little filler and to the point. Informative and utilitarian read that leaves out unnecessary babble. I like these books!
3,Golf Architecture Bible,For all the golf architecture geeks out there. Great directory of golf architects and courses. Somewhat out of date so missing the last couple decades of development but still a great historical reference.
4,Glitzy Christian Worship,"Great worship dvd. Lively, young. Could be shown when having friends over. So tired of American Southern Gospel. Interviews with young Christans is great concept. Very good musicianship. Not too over the top in production. I think they kept it real. Prefer this to Hillsong Australia. Would like the London group to produce another."
1,disappointing,"From the reviews I thought this was going to be good. Not worth the postage to ship it, but tells a little about scallop fishing!"
4,Off Season,"I always enjoy Philip Craig's writing. His characters are real to life and fun to get to know. I have read almost everything about J.W., Zee and the kids. Also enjoy his collaboration with William Tapply. I like the way the characters age from book to book. First, just dating, then married, the children arrive and we get to watch them grow. It is like having very nice neighbors next door. The introducing of the recipes is great too and I have tried some of them and they are as good as they sound in the books. Fishing will never be a hobby of mine but J.W.(via Philip Craig) makes it really sound like fun. Shall look forward to many more books in the future."
4,For Vineyard Lovers,"If you love the Vineyard at any time of year you'll love these books. The mysteries are passably good. The description of the island, its inhabitants and their lifestyles are right on. My wife and I took a bus tour there using the local public transportation. One could get off and back on as many times as one would like. Advisable to have a schedule though with the different routes so you can time your rides without lengthy waits. During the excursion, listening to several of the natives I was struck by how well the late Philip Craig portrayed them. Clamming and Fishing are elevated to religions there. Most if not all the driveways are sandy and you do indeed have to pay to go to the bathroom at Aquinnah. All in all I've enjoyed all of the books even though the revelations about the murderers are well spaced out as opposed to in a shocking conclusion.Michael J. FoyAuthor of The Kennedy Effect"
3,Martha's Vineyard Yarn,Story was a bit bland and took me awhile to get read. Just wasn't a book I couldn't put down. The dry humor was good though.
5,Witch's Brew: Good Spells for Prosperity,"Witch Bree's books are far above the usual offerings in this category. The introduction is concise yet touches on the essentials-- dealing more with your frame of mind as you continue on than a history lesson. These books are like good advice from a wise friend. I liked how the author presents the material seriously and treats it with respect, yet still remains accessible, light, and personable. Her books feel grounded, and based in traditional knowledge, while also managing to connect with the modern-day reader. Handy guide to resources, too. Oh, and did I mention the books are GORGEOUS?! The book artist and designer in me gives the visual presentation five stars as well. Highly recommended!"
3,Powerful but drains quickly,"The P50 is the precursor to the more current P76 model. It does everything the P76 does that is provide faster recycle time,it has apower guage and more flashes per charge except that the P76 does it better. The P50 was meant to be used with the Metz 50, 45 CT/CL Handle mount flashes, but can also power the 58 AF-1 hot shoe flash and the Metz digital 76. What is great about this is that you only need to carry one power pack with you to cover an entire event. My only gripe with this battery pack is that the power drains pretty quickly when left idle. Make sure you recharge it to full before leaving your house to avoid unpleasant situations. The good thing is that you can trickle charge the unit indefinately, so your flash is ready when needed."
5,"Critical Mass, review from a woman's point of view","The positions of Flexion Approach by Steve Holman is by far the most amazing and effective way of training, without wasted time and needless effort."
5,Excelent read!,"Great read, lots of info on Nuu-Chah-Nulth territory's, language, dwellings, customs and war.Most detailed are archaeological research's."
5,Great product,"I have been using EMP Vaginal Cream almost daily for over a year. No more problem with vaginal dryness and uncomfortable intercourse. Arousal and sensitivity has increased tremendously as well as general discomfort in the vaginal area is no longer an issue. I would recommend this product to anyone suffering from vaginal discomfort, whether sexually active or not."
1,Didn't work,"After reading other reviews, I was excited to try this. Sorry to say it did not help. Don't waste your money."
1,Does not display special characters correctly.,The special Esperanto characters are missing in the kindle version of this book. The result is horrible and unreadable.
1,Huge list of words to memorize before understanding it,The book starts with a huge list of words but it doesn't really start teaching you how to use them until near the end.
3,An O.K. game.,"This game is alright,but alot of things are bad about it. First:graphics! The graphics look like they came right out of a comic book! [BAD]Second:the nosies! Ohhhh, how they make me think twice about play it again.And finally: music! The music sucks! That all I hav to say.Everything else is really cool! LOTS OF GORE! ACTION! AND MULTIPLAYER MODES! But for hard-core shoots like me, this not your game. It's to fast and it feels really short. The bonus levels are acually kinda cool. Any way, this game is only good for rental."
4,Metroid Prime it isn`t,"Just played Serious Sam: Next Encounter on the Game Cube & Metroid Prime it isn't. Serious Sam: Next Encounter is at best shoddy. The game looks very dated and the visuals failed to impress in any way.There is a certain amount humour contained within Serious Sam: Next Encounter, and believe me you will need a sense of humour as you laugh hysterically at what a bad game this is.Serious Sam: Next Encounter is without doubt a rent before you buy title."
1,Awful,"Serious Sam = One Awful game! - It really is awful, rubbish, useless example of a game. I could go on, but I won't, it's not worth my time."
1,VERY POOR GAME,"Serious Sam: Next Encounter really is the weakest of all the Serious Sam games released to date.If I were to rate the graphics, then I would give them about 2/10 on a good day. The graphics are too rough to look at for extended sessions, the game features simple textures that you'd expect to see on a PS One game, and not on a next gen console like the PS2 or Game cube. You would think that the lack of impressive graphics might be made up for by good game play, but no, the game is dull and repetitive. It really is quite shocking to see such a poor release as this one.I would not wish this game on anybody. Take note!"
1,Dreadful Game,"I cannot believe someone gave Serious Sam Next Encounter 5 stars - it is a dreadful game. The levels maybe huge, they are huge and bland with it and where are all the enemies to shoot - hiding somewhere? - On the PC version there appears to be at times 30 to 40 creatures charging at you all at once, on this the PS2 version there appears to about 8 creatures charging at you at any one time, it really is a very poor interpretation of the PC version. There is no excitement to be had.What with the lack of excitement and the low level poor graphics - steer clear of this one"
5,"Fresh, phat, and phantastic","Wow! In the real world, these super talents would be commanding major attention. This is a must-have CD that never gets stale, and will always be relevant... ultraforever. Hot, now, and brilliant. Accessible brilliant alternative pop that you've never heard before. Buy it and stun your friends."
5,Why does christian rock have to be followers?,"If you have followed these guys since the days of Mortal, then you know that there are a few christian acts that do lead. Fold Zandura creates a fresh sound in the world of mostly copied sounds. The fused sound of techno/electronica/industrial/pop keep the sound new for each song. Definite must have."
4,One of the best mixes of Techno and Alternative ever!!,"Fold Zandura is a great band with a very new, fresh, cutting edge sound. The songs are heartfelt with great lyrics and the music is energitic and good. ""Please Believe"", their first single, was a great ballad of sincerity and apology, not to mention just a great song. But don't let it fool you into thinking these guys are soft, because the rest of the album is up beat and chalked full of energy. Powerful drums and great hooks make this album a must for every music lover. Strains of Techno, alternative, and Pop can all be found, making this, in my opinion, one of the best albums to come out of the 90's."
4,Brings me back to late 90's alternative,I like this cd it gives me flash backs to when I was young and free-spirited in high school. It takes me back to the fresh and interesting alternative music scene and culture back in the late 90's. Good price used. Very diverse mix of music on this cd.
4,Can't beat the entertainment value for the price...,"This series is somewhat like Pokemon, but with a more overarching storyline than Pokemon's ""let's just collect more and be the best."" Monster Rancher's story involves a little boy gathering these monster friends to help defeat the main villain. At least he's not self-serving!Although the animation is a little dated, the characters are very cute (mostly non-frightening to a small child) and the story is easy for them to follow. I think it would keep small children entertained, but older kids would likely wrinkle their nose at the content and animation.Check your local dollar store, though, because that's where I found the copy I purchased, and there's no need to pay more for shipping than the item.Note that this is NOT a bootleg. The company Digiview Entertainment buys the rights to older programs SUPER cheap, and then sells the DVDs at the dollar stores. (Old cartoons or movies that nobody renewed the copyright.)"
5,Colored Norpro Bowl,"Use these as bowls for chopped herbs, coarse salts and peppers while cooking. Looks great for serving condiments. The spoon give the it a complete look when place on a buffet."
5,Drawing from the mind painting from the heart,This book covers all aspects of painting.One of the best references I have
2,Poor manufacturing,This product's threads are not good enough. I had to clean threads with a metal brush to get the threads attach to a pipe. Only half of the threads were good. The tightening handle is good.Don't buy it.
1,Not happy,"I love the sent of vanilla and have ordered this product several times before, however, on this occasion the scent was drastically different and I did not like it at all... I have since changed to a different product as this was the second time I ordered this item and the scent was terribly off. I must say it was delivered in a timely manner..."
5,"Great,Great Great Great!!!!",This Movie Rocks! I Like It So Much That I watched It So Many Times The Tape Broke! i Guess Im The Only One Who Put A Review For This movie. For Right Now Anyways... So Come On If U Havent Saw This Movie Then Go On And Rent it And Then Put Your Review in. I Garentee Youll Love It!
5,These lights are amazing,"I bought these lights for our motorhome awning. We sometimes get back to the motorhome after dark and it's difficult to cook on the barbecue grill. I put 60 watt bulbs in each light and there is more than enough light. In fact, I am going to change some of the lights to 40 watt because you can see our motorhome from way down the road due to the lights being so bright. The lights seem to be very sturdy plastic, the cord is very long and stretchy. Amazon had a great price. They definitely light up our camp site. And they look great. During the holidays, I'm going toput different color lights in them also to decorate. Highly recommend them. We had tried so many other less expensive light strings but they never provided enough light. This string does the trick!"
2,Sypder Tv Pro,"Well, I bought this product in the hopes that it would accurately fix the colors on my sony bravia lcd and it did not. With the cost of this product, I would have not have purchased this if I knew how in accurate it would be. I instead purchased the pantone display lt, much better calibrator, and the picture looks stunning."
1,Quickly broke,This worked well for the first six months through two family sicknesses. Then I pluged it in today and the fan won't turn and it smells like it is burning. I would not recommend this item.
2,Vicks 1 Gal Cool Mist Humidifier,This product worked well for the first 90 days. The highest setting was pretty loud. But at least it worked. After that the humidifier had a very poor efficiency. This is one of those items that you have to constantly replace.
3,Great White Noise Machine,"This machine isn't the best as a humidifier, as the filter is a big problem to keep clean. However, I use them as a great white noise machine. It is one of the better ones I have tried and they last a VERY long time. I have had one as long as 8 years now. So, if you need help to keep noise down...this is for you."
3,"Ok for small rooms, very quiet","This humidifier is a decent one of you are using it in a small, closed room, because you can only put the fan speed on its ""low"" setting. I have found that if I change the setting to ""high"", the wicker filter doesn't stay wet and ends up burning towards the top. No, there aren't flames, but the filter becomes dark brown and very hard in the burnt areas, and eliminates its ability to wick the water.For me, if I ran it on the ""low"" setting in my bedroom, the filter lasted about two months before it started to fall apart. The only humidifier I have tried that is quieter than this one is the Vick's Ultrasonic. Yes, this unit does make the dreaded ""glug glug"" sound when it brings in more water from the tank, but it's not that bad. It lasts about three seconds and it isn't very loud at all. If you are a very light sleeper it may wake you, but you would have to be such a light sleeper that rain or your furnace kicking on would wake you up."
1,Beware of what's lurking,"I used this thing 3 times and by the 3rd time, EVERYONE in the house caught a cold. The filter, apperently, hoards germs."
1,disapointed,"I never got any further than picking up the box from my front porch after ups delivered it. I could hear pieces of the unit moving around in the box and the corner of the box was damaged. When it was shipped it was not put in a box with shipped material around it, it was shipped in only the Vicks humidifier box. I really needed the unit and was very disapointed. Will go to local store for another brand"
4,"Nice design, easy to clean and use.",I like that the water tank is transparent so you can see how much water is remaining.My only complaint is that that highest setting is WAY too loud. Replacement wicks have also been hard to find.
1,Did not like this humidifier!!,"I've been relying on my baby's humidifier to counter the radiator's drying heat, esp. now in the winter months. Also, a humidifier is so helpful when the baby is sick...but the Vicks humidifier has let me down. The filter needs to be replaced too often, or you start smelling the mold growth, yuck. And, every now and again, you hear a big guzzling sound as the water drips down which is a little disturbing to the baby. Don't settle for this. Ultimately, I think the Vicks is a waste of your time and money. Invest in really good humidifier for the long haul:)"
2,GLUG GLUG GLUG,"Nice humidifier, UNTIL you need to keep your baby asleep while the thing makes this absolutely ridiculous glugging noise throughout the night (even on the low setting!!) -- woke our baby up, woke us up, 7AM I'm putting this thing back into its box (which was already in the recycle bin) and back to the store. Bought one of the Crane humidifiers (the frog) and it works beautifully and most importantly - SILENTLY."
1,Filter and Mold Problem!,"I bought this humidifer after I felt the other one was too old (we had it for a number of years). I loved the look of it and thought it was the best deal for the price. After about 2 weeks of using it, I looked at the filter and couldnt believe the amount of mold! It was disgusting and I know that it could really harm my 6 month old. So I went to buy another filter and after speaking to others on a message board about the filter (Pregnancy Message Board) everyone else had the same complaint. The settings are fine, the low and medium I think are ok. The high setting is quite loud. But the mold problem is not a risk I am willing to take! I have taken the filter out of the unit to see how fast it would air dry and its been 2 full days and still the filter is not dry. I wish I could take it back but its too late. I'm on the hunt for another humidifer."
2,"""Jet Engine Quiet"" would be more appropriate","""Whisper Quiet""? Unless your idea of a whisper comes from the roar of a Boeing engine, you may disagree with this marketing phrase.This humidifier was purchased for my two year old daughter's room, and while it does function adequately as a humidifier, the fan noise associated with the lowest speed is much louder than a whisper, and the fan noise on speeds 2 and 3 are just ridiculous.The filters are convenient to change, but they mold quickly, and clog with minerals in about 1-2 weeks, even with soft clean water. And they're not cheap.The only reason I didn't give this unit 1 star is because the tank is easy to fill, and it does in fact humidify the air. The manner in which it does it though, is noisy, costly and inconvenient."
2,Adds moisture but expensive upkeep,"PROS:definitely adds moisture to the air.compartment for the menthol pads really helps when sick.CONS:expensive upkeep. our filter molds within a month, which means $8 for a new one. I could have bought another humidifer for what Ive spent on filters over the past year.the fan started growing mold within a yearcleaning is tedious and still doesnt prevent moldOrdering a Crane right now."
2,"Good moisture, huge puddle","Yesterday we went and bought it at CVS, not on Amazon.1. On the highest setting it is VERY loud, on medium setting it's tolerable, but still noisy.2. We filled it and turned it on at 1:30 a.m. At 6:30 a.m. the tank was completely empty. Thankfully I had put the device on a cookie sheet, but unfortunately that wasn't enough to contain the mess. The piece of furniture and the carpet underneath were sopping wet.3. Good: The air was actually nice and moist, so it did help to moisten the air.I am, however, going to return the product and go with a different brand (plus ultrasonic) as originally intended since I'm not willing to go through this mess again.So, 4 stars for humidity, none for the mess."
1,LEAKS WATER ON FLOOR,"I bought this 6 hours ago and am packing it up to take it back to the store. I came in after turning on for 3 hours and my carpet was soaking wet. I tried one more time, this time fortunately I put a cooking pan underneath to catch any water. Once again, it leaked water everywhere. I read instructions again and I have done everything right. DO NOT BUY."
1,Leaks,We bought and returned this humidifier only to have the same problem with the second one. The water doesn't seem to be efficiently sucked up and it eventually overflows and leaks.
2,"mediocre humidifier, but easily available locally","This is a mediocre humidifier at best, I only bought it because it was at my local CVS and I needed one at that moment. It is not easy enough to clean, it does not humidify well, it is louder than it should be; I will continue to research and try to find a better one."
2,Tank Cracks,I agree with the comments of the other reviews and I had another problem with this unit. After filling this tank countless times I started to notice some stress cracks on the plastic tank but it did not leak. So we continued to use the humidifier and those cracks eventually started leaking. So we're back to boiling water on the stove.
1,Not the Best for Me,"I purchased then returned this product. The main reason was because it didn't seem to efficiently draw air through the moist wick filter. The tip of the filter dries up. The air seems to travel on the outside of the filter before its expelled out of the top. In addition, the fan is extremely loud on high, so you can't run it a max capacity during the night. (Med and low were ok but it didn't seem to generate enough humidity) The ""scent pad"" quickly wore out and is not very functional. Looking at the humidifier straight as pictured on this site, the air is channeled left and right. it is not 360 degrees. There are better humidifiers on the market."
4,Great Humidifier but noisy.,The Vicks Cool Humidifier does it's job. I especially like that you can use the Vicks Scent Pad for easier breathing if you are using it for someone with a cold. Luckily my daughters don't mind white noise when sleeping so the noise isn't an issue for my family. But if you have light sleepers in your house I would look elsewhere.
1,What does it do?,"This does absolutely nothing except waste electricity. I looked at the reviews before I added it to my baby registry thinking it was the best one out there. Nope, not true at all. Very disappointed, I would give it 0 stars if it was an option. I just recently purchased the Vicks Warm mist humidifier that you can add the vaporizer. It is pefect, and it works! The room stays warm and you can feel the humidity when you walk into the room. My daughter sleeps so much better with it, her nose doesn't get as stuffy and her cough subsides allowing her to get a good nights rest. I will give THAT one 10 stars!"
2,There has to be a better humidifier out there!,"After just a couple of months of on and off use the water tank leaks everywhere when you try to place it on the base. Also, talk about high maintenance. Do you really have to disassemble and clean every humifier on a daily basis?! Also, good luck finding replacement filters. I've been to 3 stores with no luck so far. Guess I'll have to order them online. Yes, it is pretty noisy on the high setting but you can put it on high when the baby is not in the room, close the door and let it do it's thing. Once my son is ready to sleep, we just turn in down to medium or low and it's fine. A little background noise helps most babies sleep anyway. At his point the filter is so gross I'm not using it though."
1,Didn't work for me!,We bought this during the winter when our bedroom became very dry during the night. We ran this for two days straight w/ no help. The only thing it did was cool the room -- the humidity did not increase. I too held onto the box & will be returning it for another type of humidifier.
4,Works GREAT,"I don't know what all the 'fuss' is about regarding this humidifier. We have had one for almost 2 years in our bedroom and it does a wonderful job. So it does make the ""bubble sound"" when it needs more water, but it has NEVER awakened us. It does a great job of putting the cool mist in a small room and runs very quietly. With our having it for almost 2 years, not once have we had any problems with water on the floor, unless my husband didn't put the water tank on it correctly and we have never had the water container to crack/break at all. I would highly recommend this product for a small bedroom around the size of 150-175 sq.ft. Just another hint - one never smells the cool mist unless they get right up to the output vents, but oh if one is having allergy/sinus problems you can sure tell if its working or not."
4,I love this humidifier!,"This is a fabulous humidifier! It is VERY quiet, it kicks out at a fantastic rate and the air is very nice & moist. One downfall-the filters; if you have very hard water, you need to take the filter out & wash it once a week to clean it by soaking it in hot water & rinsing clean (that way it stays in pretty good condition for about a month) also, the top of the filter dries out quickly (to avoid this, simply flip the filter over every night). The filter replacements are [not bad] but it's cheaper to buy 12 at a time. I highly recommend this product if you are able to commit to keeping it clean. If you don't have the time to maintain this wonderful humidifier, this one is not for you."
3,"Cool, quiet, but runs through filters","I have had my filter for 1 year and use it only in the winter to counteract the dry heat. Last winter I ran through 3 filter for the season, and this winter it looks like I will do the same. I want to consider a second one for my upcomming baby, but I am trying to see it there are any other better on the filters. The filters are $8-9 a piece. They grow mold very quickly. They last 3 weeks to a month. It is very quiet, feels good, and works great on my sinuses. But keep your nose alert for the mold smell, and prepare your pockets for the filters."
1,DONT EVER BUY A VICKS HUMIDIFIER,"this is the second Vicks humidifier I have waisted my money on. from day one out of the box they leak, the mechanics break within a year and sometimes they decide to shut off for no reason or you need to bang on them to get them started. yes, they give you a waranty but who the hell has the time to deal with sending this thing back to the manufactuer and why should you have to?There are pleanty of companies that make good humidifiers. Vicks should stick to what it does well. Cough drops"
2,LEAKY!,"We purchased this humidifier and were relatively pleased with its ability to humidify the air, the quietness, etc. We thought the filters were hard to find, too. Not always in stock at Target or the like, so if you see them, buy a couple. The other problem we had was that it leaked. We have hardwood floors and always put a towel underneath the unit when we ran it in our daughter's room. Several times, we woke up in the morning to a soaked towel and an empty water reservoir. We thought if we used this model any more we would run the risk of damaging our floors, so we threw it out and are searching for something better!"
5,Great,"I am an nanny for 3 children, and the oldest (almost 7) and youngest (almost 2) are seemingly more prone to respiratory irritation than their middle sib. Put one of these in the baby's room, and end up running it most nights, just because it seems to keep her from getting irritated. Same for the eldest. For a very reasonable price, this is a great product, and I'll be buying one for my baby when that day comes!"
1,not worth it,"Though I haven't had the leaking issues that some folks have, I would have to whole-heartedly agree that this machine is outrageously loud when on the high setting. Fortunately, the medium is fine for my smallish bedroom. BUT the problem I have is with the light! Nowhere on the box did I see mention of the horrible, massive, green glowing light. As someone who needs it pitch black to sleep at night, this thing is like putting a giant beacon in the middle of the room. And despite my best efforts at covering the light without covering the vents, it's impossible to drown it out completely. OH. AND the gurgling. Almost forgot - it periodically gurgles - loudly - while it's on. Tends to wake one up on and off all night long. If I didn't need a humidifier so badly for my asthma this week during allergy season, I'd have taken this unit back where I bought it immediately. Unfortunately, I've been hard-pressed to find one."
1,DO NOT BUY!,"If you want a product that leaks like a sieve, is louder than a jet engine, and does not throw water into the air, then this product is for you."
1,Same problem as others WATER ON THE FLOOR,"I bought both KAS (Vicks) humidifiers V745A and rwm-975n and they both had the same problem. THEY LEAK WATER ALL OVER THE FLOOR! One leaks from the cap, the other leaks no matter how you mount the water tank. A coincidence? No, KAS makes horrible humidifiers."
2,Cool Mist - maybe,"I honestly can not tell that it works, we have gone through 2 as the plastic is so cheap it breaks when slightly bumped. I have a humidity sensor in the room and it barely notices any change when we have this going - the only thing we can tell for sure is the fan is loud and drops the temperature in the room so we end up turning up the heat (and drying out the air more)"
5,excellent product,"How much sound it generates depends on the speed you set it on but that's actually beneficial because it lulls my son right to sleep and the humidifier itself works wonders. My baby breathes easily through the night. The replacement filters are very easy to find. Kaz makes the product, it's written inside the humidifier where the filter is located, and can be pruchased at kazstore.com"
2,Shopping for a new humidifier,I purchased this a year ago when my baby was born but am now shopping around for something else. The plastic pieces that hold the lid on the water tank broke after a few months. I risk a big spill everytime I turn it upside down full of water! I've also spent about 3 times the purchase price in filters. They get moldy after only limited use.The lowest setting is very quiet but I find it doesn't add enough moisture to the room. The highest setting is so loud I can't hear the baby in the monitor.
2,Probably better choices out there,"We have had this for about a year. It worked very well at first, but in the past few months I can't tell that it is doing anything but making noise. Even with new filters, I can't feel any humidity in the room.There are 3 settings. The low setting is so quiet I can barely tell it's on, but it doesn't put out any moisture. The middle setting is ok, it used to put out enough moisture for our room but not anymore. It's not too quiet, but not horribly loud either... it's barely tolerable to sleep with. The high setting sounds like i'm in a wind tunnel and would be impossible to sleep with.The tank has a lid that you put on and screw a quarter turn to make it stay on. There are 3 tiny tabs that hold it on. 2 have broken off long ago, so only one is left to hold the lid on. These broken tabs cause it to leak when the tank is turned upside down to sit on the base. We really need a new one and will go with a different brand this time."
1,Humidifier,This product leaks constantly to the point I can't use it anymore because I am scared my floor will get drenched
3,Nice Humidifier. Ran down quicker than I expected.,"This was a nice unit, easy to use and didn't leak. The fan engine did run down after a year, which was a bit disappointing for the price."
3,Vicks cool mist humidifier,"Price was great. Little disappointed in the output of cool mist. Could be a little stronger . I use it so I do not wake up every morning stuffed up. Great for that,but if you are really in need of a strong concentration of cool mist, buy a different brand"
1,Worst Humidifier Ever,"I have owned numerous humidifiers over the years and this is by far the worst one ever. Very poorly constructed and designed. Yes, it does it's job as a humidifier but the vents on the bottom completely soaked my floor. The bottom also collects condensation and contributes to the floor soaking."
1,Not what I wanted,The pictured item is not the item I recieved. It was a vicks humidifier but it was the Honeywell V400 1.5GAL Mist Impeller. I was surprised when I opened my package and very displeased I was not given the humidifier I had ordered and wanted!
2,gurgle gurgle,"i've had this humidifier for about 4 years. it does what it's supposed to as far as bringing some moisture to the room, but the intermittent, very LOUD gurgling is so annoying in the middle of the night. after a week or so i've gotten used to it every season, but this year i've had enough. i bought my baby one of the little elephant humidifiers by Crane and it is amazingly silent! i'm going to get an adult version and finally retire the loud gurgler."
4,Great White Noise Machine!,"We actually use it more for white noise than moisture, our baby sleeps on the ground floor, the loud setting is perfect till we go to bed. Makes his room rather cold, but we turn it down when we go to bed. The lowest setting is hardly audible. Makes loud clunky water noises every now and then, but thankfully doesn't wake him. I'm in need of a new filter now, hoping to find one easily...."
2,Sounds like an airplane engine,"The lowest setting is pretty close to ""whisper soft"" but the medium and high settings are VERY loud. If it is on loud, it is not possible to have a conversation in the same room without shouting. On the other hand, it could serve as a white-noise machine with humidifier function."
4,I'd buy it again,"We've had this unit for two seasons now and would buy it again. It's definitely working for us...no signs of vapor ""residue"" (but it's supposed to be that way according to Vicks) but the water tank depletes itself so it's going somewhere! The unit is a little loud on the high setting but then, I don't have anything to compare it with. We use high for a couple hours before going to bed, then put on the lowest setting during the nite. Works great."
3,its okay,"This product was very difficult to work. After finaalt getting it on, it took a minute to fully circulate but after that it was an ok buy."
3,wakes baby up,"this is a good humidifier but if you're buying this for a nursery, beware. when the water level starts to drop a little, bubbles come up from the bottom widget causing a fairly loud glug, glug, glug sound...up to 5 glugs. this is disappointing since it's otherwise a good product, but if you have a baby who is a light sleeper it can wake them up every time it glugs. mine no longer wakes up to it, but she does get startled when she's about to drift off to sleep, making that process lengthier and more frustrating than it needs to be."
2,disappointing,"This is a decent inexpensive humidifier and definitely does the trick. However, there are numerous caveats to note. It lasted only 2 winters: I lifted it up the other day and the handle broke off, rendering it useless. Prior to breaking, however, the major negative was, as noted by many reviewers, the filters. They are very difficult to get and you have to get them a lot--ideally I would have changed them monthly. This might be because I have cats, but they would get really yucky after about 2 weeks, making me wonder what was being spewed into my already dander-filled air."
1,V3500 did not work at all for me.,Tried five times to get this machine to work. What is said above is true if the water doesn't flow over the bottom of the tank and motor and the carpet and pad and cabinet and wherever I tried to set it on a flat surface.check this one out at the store before bringing it home or put it in a high sided large baking sheet with cat litter underneath it.I was terribly disappointed in the operation of this item.LynReturned it to Target.
1,Vicks Cool Mist Humidifier,"We have it in the baby's room. When it's on, and the water is flowing out of the tank, it makes too much of a bubbling sound and wakes up baby. We had it in our bedroom for a while, and it even woke me and my husband up throughout the night."
1,Worst Purchase I've Made in a Long Time,My infant son has terrible eczema and we really needed a humidifier with high-performance and a filter. This was a terrible choice! The first night of use resulted in a leak that completely destroyed our wooden changing table and warped our hard wood floors. Very faulty construction - has vents on the bottom of the unit that leaked NON-STOP. On to absolutely everything. This $40 purchase has turned into a $750 disaster with the cost of floor repair and a new dresser. Wish I could post a review with no stars. Shame on Vicks for continuing to sell such a defective product! Do not purchase this unit!!!!
1,So disappointed,"FYI - item was purchased at Target, but the review needs to be written. First of all, I did my research and decided to go to Bed Bath and Beyond to purchase. Once I got there, they had a total of one kind of humidifier compared to the many that were available online. I had my coupon, was ready to spend more on a better humidifier. Plus, I needed one that day, and didnt want to wait 5-6 days for shipping. Fine, I head over to Target and purchase this one. First time i turned it on, it leaked. I thought it was just a one time deal. Nope, woke up this morning to a soaked carpet. The humidifier was on top of a small entertainment center, not on the floor. Will be returning this item immediately to Target. Very disappointed."
2,Filter eater,"My wife and I bought this for our new baby's room. I can't believe the price of the filters. We need a new filter every 2-3 weeks due to mold growth and they cost [$$$] for 12 filters. That's [$$$] with shipping every 4-6 months. Wet air just isn't worth that much. I am desperately trying to find a better choice. On a side note, the water fill cap is very tight, my wife cannot remove it so I always have to. The rest off the features have worked great. If it didn't eat filters or if the filters cost less then I would have given it a 5 star rating. I would recommend shopping for another model."
3,I recommend this product,"I have had this humidifier for 2 years. I bought it primarily for my husband and I, and after the birth of my child I use it for her.I like the large capacity of the tank. I find the tank cap is hard to remove but I'm usually able to do it with some elbow grease.The room feels humid on low or high settings so it works fine. It's louder than I'd prefer but I'm not sure how loud others are.The filter needs to be changed a lot which is a downfall. I probably don't change it as often as I should but we replace it every other month.Overall I'd recommend it to someone."
1,Watch out!,"I bought this humidifier a while back and loved it at first. In the beginning it worked great and my only complaint was that it was hard to find replacement filters. However, I recently trashed the thing after it woke my up one night making a loud buzzing noise and throwing sparks! It also gave off that burnt electrical smell. I checked out Vicks' and KAZ's websites for a recall, but there isn't one for this model. There's no way I'll even consider buying a replacement just like this one! I'll find a different brand. I value my life and don't want to burn down my house, so this sucker went straight to the trash where it belongs!"
5,"Great Humidifier, Must-have for Babies",We're using this right now since our 2-month-old got a cold. I like the size and how easy it is to fill up the water tank. We also bought the new Protec self-cleaning cartridge at our local Babies R Us store so we don't have to worry about anything growing in there. You gotta have a humidifer for the life of your child. I make sure to let mine dry out thoroughly in between uses to further ensure that nothing gets inside the humidifying part. No need for a bigger model and this one has 3 settings that are great!
3,It's ok,"This humidifier is ok, not great. It doesn't have an automatic off in case the water runs out. Also, the part that screws off so you can put water is hard to screw on and off. I got this for my baby's room, but after using this humidifier, I got her a warm mist humidifier instead. It wasn't so bad that I threw this one out. We now use it in our bedroom."
1,Pain in the rear . . .,"We used this humidifier for 2 weeks before I ditched it. The filter was gross, and I cleaned the humidifier according to the instructions. I borrowed my Mom's humidifier (bought 30 years ago), and it worked great -- then I realized how poorly the Vicks worked. After doing a little research, I discovered a humidifier at Target and have been very pleased with its performance. You still have to clean it on a regular basis, but there's no filter. I would recommend spending your money on the Crane humidifier.(...)"
2,Only good for one season,"We were very happy with this humidifier when we first got it. It seemed to work well, and wasn't excessively loud. Unfortunately, the second winter we tried to use it, the motor had developed an intolerable buzzing sound, even on the lowest setting. There was no way anyone, especially our child, could sleep through it. This humidifier is now in a landfill somewhere. We only used it a few times that first year, and cleaned and stored it properly. I don't think a quality product should only last a year or less."
2,A Little Dry,"I read Charles Bowden in college and really liked his book Blue Desert. Blue Desert was artful, nicely written, not heavy handed on the politics and a pleasure to read. This book, Killing the Hidden Waters was a different story. Motivated by a belief back in the 90's that Phoenix was about to run dry, Chuck made his case over and over and over, unsuccessfully as it turns out. Tediously written and with no artistic flourish that I could find anywhere in the tome, Bowden left this reader thirsty and parched. The material is of course very dated now, even after a newer forward authored about a decade back.I would not recommend the book."
4,Small but great!,"This bookbag is slightly smaller than what I anticipated, but it fits my son's school supplies just fine. The only thing that he can't fit in there is his Five-Star Binder - unless he shoves it in and fights with it. Other than that, I love the JanSport name and believe that these bags are made with quality product. Highly recommend!!"
3,Too small for college students,"I like the brand Jansport. I've been using one for ten years until it broke, so I just decided to go with another Jansport backpack. However, contrary to what other reviewers say, it's not as big. I put a laptop and two folders in, and the backpack's full. If you're looking for a big backpack don't buy this one."
5,Great Compact,This is the perfect backpack for middle school students. My son wanted a backpack that wasn't too big and bulky. This is just the right size.
3,Backpack,"This is your pretty average backapack. I bought it for school, and when it arrived I realized it was much smaller than I anticipated (which is really my fault for not checking the dimensions). If you need a backpack that is functional and will carry a decent amount of books, I reccommend this product. However, if you are trying to carry around a library for school, which is what I'm having to do, I would look for something a bit bigger."
2,So small!!,"I'm sure this is a lovely, durable backpack but I had no idea it would be so small! I'm returning it and getting the superbreak jansport backpack instead to get a little more room. It would be nice to be able to see backpacks side by side or back to back in order to compare sizes. Also seeing them on people would be nice."
3,"Child's Backpack, Grade's (1-5) only","They should say its for kids and too small for you average middle school, highschool, etc. payloads. Perfect for grade school, unfortunately i bought it fo a highschool student. It is too small for anything but the lower grades carrying a couple of books. but the quality is clearly Jansport, ""awesome"". Too bad, i own it and cannot use it."
4,Can't beat this for a basic backpack,"The kids wanted something basic, but durable. I wanted something inexpensive. We all got our way. Can't beat it for the price."
5,I wish I were a boy again...,"Moominpappa's Memoirs is the the most imaginative book of the series, although all of them are marvellous. This volume gives you a perspective on the history of Moominland. Snip: (...)"
4,Helpful information,"This book gave me great practical tips for ICF home construction. It was not my first exposure to the topic so much of it I was already familiar with, however it would be a great place to begin."
5,Voyage on the Great Titanic,I read a book called Dear America Voyage on the Great Titanic.I thought that it was a great book because it is a dairy of a girl named Margaret Brady.If you like reading about old things from the past you will love this book.I think that kids ages 8 and up would be able to read this book.I totally recommend this great book!!!
4,A description of a first class passenger's voyage onTitanic,"A poor girl (Margaret Ann Brady) who lives in an orphanage in England gets a small amount of luck. Mrs. Carstairs, a first cass woman from the USA came to England to get tickets for the Titanic. She buys two tickets (one for her husband one for herself), but her husband is unable to go. She doesn't want to go by herself so she a fine young girl from St. Abernathy's Orphanage For Girls. The lucky girl Margaret Ann gets picked and is very delighted. While on the ship she learns many things such as you would never call Titanic a boat, it is a ship. Maragaret meets the steward for her room, Robert, and they soon become great friends. But one night disaster strikes and everyone is called to come to the Promenade with their life belts. Robert (trying to keep people calm) says it is only a drill, but Margaret knows that it isn't. Why would they have a drill in the middle of the night?"
5,A really great book,"Margaret Ann Brady lives in an orphanage for girls.She is quiet and likes to read books.When the wealthy Mrs. Carstairs hires Margaret to be her companion, her life will change....forever. At first Margaret is not quite sure if she wants to go on a ship.But when she gets her first glimpse of the TITANIC, she changes her mind. Once on the great ship Margaret marvels at the glamour of first-class.She meets famous and very rich people.But then disaster strikes. ""Voyage on the Great Titanic"" is probably one of the best books about TITANIC...........the worst tragedy ever."
4,Voyage on the Great Titanic,"The story Voyage on the Great Titanic includes several interesting events. First, Rose goes to Mrs. Carstairs to ask her if she could bring her to America to see where her father was. Then, Mrs. Carstairs said yes and they get on the Titanic, where Rose meets Jack. Second, while, they are having fun the Titanic hits an ice burg. Only half the people were able to get on the lifeboats, before the Titanic sank. My writing makes this the book sound boring, so I recommend you read this book and fin out the adventure on yourself."
4,Dear Diary....I have met a new friend - Margaret Ann Brady,"We learn the story of Margaret's once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. A young orphan girl who is granted a great fortune (or misfortune) as she is selected to travel with a very rich American on the grand Titanic's maiden voyage. We experience her day to day adventures aboard the ship and the ultimate tragedy that befell the cruiseliner. While this work is based on historical events, Margaret is a fictitious character. She is an enjoyable character to share this piece of history with. I enjoyed reading this book through the eyes of a child."
4,Historical fiction done right.,"'Voyage on the Great Titanic: The Diary of Margaret Ann Brady' by Ellen Emerson White is a part of the Dear America collection for children/young adults. The books are written as though you are reading the main character's diary, and started being published widely after the American Girls series got very popular. I got this one at a book fair in middle school, and I still enjoyed reading it as an adult. ...For full review, please visit me at Here Be Bookwyrms on Blogger!herebebookwyrms dot blogspot dot com"
5,A Must for Titanic Buffs as well!,"I don't remember where I got this book but it was secondhand. The original owner had left the receipt when the owner bought it at the Titanic exhibition in Atlantic City. It's a nice little surprise. Anyway, the story of Margaret Ann Brady, an orphan girl, who is hired by Mrs. Carstairs to travel with her aboard the doomed Titanic is quite interesting and it's pretty accurate story-telling.I liked it the best of the Dear America series so far. Since I am interested in all things Titanic, I enjoyed this book very much especially since it captures the era, the class system, and catastrophe at sea on April 14,1915."
3,"The older you are, the less likely you will enjoy the book","I read the book when I was 13, back then I thought it was a really great book. Not so much for educational purposes as it provides no information about the ship beyond what everyone already know from the movie, but rather it's a Cinderella story for a teen who loves Edwardian history. However when I read it again as a 21 year old recently, the book just fell flat. The plot is implausible, the dialogues are uninteresting, and the entire book just screams ""stuffy"". I still would thank the author for writing it though as I really did enjoy it back then."
5,Great Book!,"This is one of the best book by Ellen White. It starts out a little boring but then gets better and better as the story goes on. You will learn a lot from this book, like the sinking went into Monday morning and not what people thought it did. Over all I loved the book"
3,ehhh . . .,"Not 5 star work by any scale (especially mine), but it's not like I couldn't stand it. #1, I had a really hard time getting into the book, and I really didn't feel that she was being descriptive about the things I would have liked to know more about. Like another person's review somewhere above, she talked to much about the food. This could be due to the fact that she had lived in an orphanage for such a long time and she wasn't used to such great meals. Anyway, I guess I should be finishing up now. Basically, if you're expecting to read this book and have it be a life-changing experience or something, it isn't that. If you're looking for something to read B-cuz you're bored, this would be a good choice.Toodle"
5,Margaret Ann Brady writes in her diary about the Titanic.,"Margaret Ann Brady is a thirteen year old orphan from London. Her father died when she was seven; her mother, when she was eight. Margaret was seriously ill, so her older brother, William, left her in an orphanage. Soon after, William left for America, and started saving up to send for Margaret. But then Margaret was able to get a job as a companion to a wealthy American woman. She would get to sail to the United States in first class on the Titanic. On the ship, Margaret falls in love with a young steward, Robert. She writes in her diary about the luxeries of travelling on the ship. And then, when the Titanic hits an iceberg and sinks, Margaret writes about witnessing the tragedy. Margaret's diary was my favorite book in the Dear America series. It was very well written and I loved it."
3,Too much like the movie,"While the book was ok, it was too much like the movie. I had a feeling when I picked up the book that it was just made because of the movie. I was right. Everything in the movie was in the book. A romance with someone in lower class and giving up your lifeboat seat for them. Maybe the main charcters should have been Jack and Rose."
5,I always loved anything to do with Titanic.....,"I thought this book was great. I love the Dear America series and all of them have been good. I have also always loved Titanic, so that may be a reason why i loooooved this book."
5,My Heart Was Engaged,"I have seen the move ""Titanic"" and I was tempted to finish the movie. I was not heart broken nor did I feel very much emotion. Until I read Voyage on the Great Titanic. Margaret-Ann showed very many details and emotion which made me feel the same. This is one of the greatest books I have read. She is from England and talks like she was from England, so it was a little hard to read at first but I got use to it and understood it well. I recommend this book to all readers out there searching for the right book...."
4,best young adult novel on the tragic sinking,"A well-written and historically accurate telling of the Titanic disaster from the perspective of a young girl immigrating to the United States as a companion to a wealthy passenger. Margaret's perspective is that of an outsider, not only to the wealthy culture, but to the adult and American culture. Probably the best young adult fiction based on the disaster, as it's true to history (the period and the event) and the characters are real (Margaret is spunky, but obedient, emotional but constrained). It captures the emotional tragedy, the spirit and feel of the horrific event. For adults and the Titanic fascinated, the story isn't anything new or original or especially engaging. Grade: B+"
3,Beautiful but not hardy,Love the looks and have gotten many compliments. Sadly it is tearing up after only a few months of use.
3,Good looking shoe for formal occaisions,"Shoe looks great with formal wear. Comfortable if you are used to wearing high heels. Do not suggest them, if you do not wear high heels regularly."
2,"Thin, poor quality duct tape","I've never thought much about the quality of the duct tape I bought, as it all seemed about the same. But this is thinner and flimsier than anything I've used before and isn't nearly as capable.If you need real duct tape, look elsewhere"
1,Weak.,"Quite possibly the worst duct tape I've ever used. The adhesive is so bad, I'm having trouble using it to hold pieces of cardboard together. Avoid like the plague."
3,Two duct tapes in picture,"There are two rolls of duct tape in the product picture so I assumed I was buying two rolls at a good price, instead I receive one roll at a higher price. Very misleading. Somewhere in sellers description it should have said 1 roll only."
3,Many pieces on one roll,"If you need a long, unbroken piece of tape, don't get this one. It worked for my purposes, but it did not tear cleanly. There were 6 different lengths (not an unbroken line of tape) of tape on the roll. That ended up being about 10 feet of tape I couldn't use, where it was double thickness and glued together."
2,way to thin,it's useful for the price i paid but it's way to thin to every hold up to heavy duty work. i wouldn't recommend it for more then kids that want to help dad work on stuff or as something to keep in the bed of you truck for whatever.
1,not what you expect....,Yeah its duct tape... it works... but their image shows 2 rolls of tape... you only get one... you can get a better price at the local hardware store.
1,Poor quality...,The quality of this poster is pretty cheap looking in my opinion. Ive bought prints of other art work @ stores like Ross and was more content. And for the price it's not worth it. I probably won't buy anything else from this site unless it's on sale.
4,no title,"Thoroughly delightful book about the goings-on in a law firm around 1920. Wryly humorous, at times full of wise discourse on the law and humanity, it is a far, far cry from Train's other books. Not a twinge of his preacherly manner. A real precursor to Perry Mason, or Poirot, complete with its Miss Wiggins (Della Street and Miss Lemon), Willie the office boy, and Bonnie Doon, the gumshoe of the outfit. Copmprised of seven short stories, the first two being murder cases, in which Mr.Tutt gets the murderer off in such a way that we agree with him. Of course, in the second instance, the murderer was promptly shot himself. But in the first, he was definitely guilty. There are a whole series of these books which were quite popular in their day, and I can see why. The courts in those times seem to have been much more lax in their procedures than nowadays."
4,it's time to get bad,"this is one of the best games of all times for many reasons such as there are hundreds of traps you can choose as to kill an invader or monsters that will destroy the invaders instantly.you ask why do you need these items to kill people because your bad to the bone and this time the bad team is gonna triumph over all.if you have ever played deception 1 or kagero deception 2 you already knows how the game plays,but if your a first time killer than this is how you play=you get a view as if you were the killers eyeballs and you have to set traps and build on to your castle as well as upgrade your trtaps and monsters to be more lethal and deadlier.trust me this is one game that you gonna get hooked on.DECEPTION AWAITS"
4,"Great game, but sluggish story.","As far as game play Deception 3 is exceptional with more traps, more places to place them, more interactive environments, and a new ""jump to the side move"". The graphics even look better, but the story is tedious; now in Japan they get voice actors and a pretty cool movie, but we get subtitles, which diminishes the story greatly. The game is great, but the load time is horrific, and a slow story with subtitles that can't be turned off only makes it worse."
5,icognito,icognito is the most interesting and sophisticated jazz funk you will ever hear . you will want to buy his entire collection . i have the entire collection . on cd is better than the next .
2,A hoary old chestnut...,"A hoary old overrated chestnut, practically farting dust.This novelization of the play by Rinehart & Hopwood was actually written by Stephen Vincent Benet.Unlike the play, the opening chapters violate a rule of trust that the writer usually establishes with the reader.My advice: Buy a copy of the actual play from Sam French and read it instead. You won't have to wade through opening scenes that don't belong.The old maid character of Lizzie nearly derails the whole affair in any version of this claptrap."
2,Okay. Longer edition is better.,I wish the press had released the other version of this book. The introduction isn't very helpful.
5,Best mouthwash ever,"This mouthwash is the best I've ever used. I never have ""morning breath"" after using this at night. I've also used it to get rid of sore throats; just gargling with it a couples of times works quickly. The ingredients are all natural and it's free of alcohol. I have tried to find other products that duplicate this one, but it is uniquely effective. I have receommended it to friends and family members and all have had positive experiences."
5,Great first person account,"I took a class from Professor Berezhkov while he was teaching here in Claremont. This book was one of our texts. The only thing more thrilling than hearing Professor Berezhkov speak was reading the book. If anyone has an interest in Soviet politics or the inner machinations of World War II politics, this is the book to read. It pre-supposes some knowledge, but if one has an interest, and has a good general knowledge, I would definitely read this book. He tells things from an insider's point of view that I haven't found anything else to compare to. The prose gets dense in parts, so I wouldn't reccomend it for a complete beginner."
3,Nice package but definitely has its faults,"I have bought two of these machines for my workplace. The display is great. It's crisp and vivid. The design of the machine is also nice. Definitely looks good in the office. The downfall of this machine are the peripherals that come with it. I had trouble with the mouse getting reception on both machines, even after replacing the batteries. Also after a few weeks of use on BOTH machines that ive purchased, the DVD-RW drive will no longer open. You can push the button, but nothing happens. Ive been coping with that problem by using a paper clip to open the drive. Luckily it's still under warranty, but a large annoyance to have to go through the Sony Support process."
2,Title confusing,"Title describes a problem of older women, but it mirrors several titles that describe Asperberger Syndrome, so actually bought this book in error."
2,Much about Nothing,"This is not a very good book. It goes around in circles and it is not an easy read. Half of the book is a waste. The author could have gotten the information across in a third the amount of pages, and leave out information that is of no value. It took forever for the author to make her point."
5,They are hard to get rid off!,"Adam and his friends are exploring the forest near Spooksville, when they come into huge block of ice hidden in the trees. They decide to melt one of the ice in the woods. When they do, a strange man appears and tries to grab them. This man has very cold hands and his eyes are not warm either. Soon there are dozens of COLD PEOPLE running in Spooksville. The Cold People are also freezing people. It seems there is nothing Adam and his friends can do. poor Adam and his friends, Why did they melt the ice. Will they freeze to?"
5,Great buy,Just what I needed. Concise and to the point. Hope author does more topics in this style. Great price too.
5,Stephanie's adventures the best!,"This is the second Stephanie book. And its great! Stephanie has got a crush on the new boy in the neaubor hood, Eddie. She thinks that he's the only boy for her! But one day everyone knows it, and she wishes shea never meet Eddie in her hole life. Isn't it just great to watch how Stephanie gets in trouble, and the crazy ways that makes her out of them? Well that this is the book for you!"
4,"Solid Knife, Friendly Price","If ""Survivalist"" is your stock and trade (a la Bear Grylls or Cody Lundin), you probably are going to spend a bit more money on a knife that your life depends on daily. But, for the recreational hiker, camper, etc. you really won't find a better knife for the money. Solid construction, sharp blade, good saw edge, plus hammerhead and nail claw make this a very versatile knife to help you with just about any task you might encounter in the outdoors. Throw in a nice sheath with pockets for flints, pocket tools, emergency fishing gear, etc. makes the package complete. It's a good deal at the MSRP, but if you can find a discount or sale it makes the Schrade Extreme Survival Knife an even more solid value. Between a sale and a coupon, I was able to score mine for $18.50 out the door! Can't beat that for this knife!!"
2,Broken blade,"Bought the knife, had it 2 weeks, threw it into plywood, broke the blade right off. Not impressed."
2,at least it is sharp out of the box,"This knife is NOT awesome. First thing i noticed was the sheath it almost 2"" too long for the blade, like it wasn't made for this knife. Second, I had to try out the hammer/nail puller. Unless you plan on using the hammer end to hang pictures on drywall, your forked, and if you do just don't plan on pulling the nail back out with the inclusive puller. It won't grab anything less that 1/4"" exposed, and the only way to get leverage is to push on the edge of the blade.It does however have a nice thick blade (the sawtooth back is the entire thickness, but works better than expected) and cut a few hairs off my arm. it isn't sharp enough to shave my arm though.Overall I will keep this knife in my box 'o' knives just so that i can loan it out and not worry about losing a ""good"" knife."
2,Is this guy beig paid by the word?,"Ideally, an historical ""slice of life"" book would tell you more about FDR than Jonathan Alter, but this is not the case with this dry account. Alter spends more time obsessing about Elanor's questionable relationship with Lorena Hickok, and characterizing FDR as an elitist snob who got lucky, than relating any new information, or describing FDR's thought processes or reasoning. Getting through it was torture."
5,Great First 100 Days,The most interesting book on FDR I've ever read. I learned a lot more about the state of our nation when FDR was elected and what FDR did to keep our republic on a more democratic path.I'm sure our new President-elect and his staff are reading this book so they can learn how to make great things happen in Washington in only 100 days.
5,Even better than expected,"An incredible look at history. Beautifully written. Rich in detail. If you think you understand this period in American history, you will be amazed with this perspective. A must read."
2,For Doctors Only?,"It was my fault for thinking I could find the answer in a book. Even just some direction would have been nice. This book goes in depth (REALLY indepth) to the medical ""why you feel happy by just smiling"" etc. but doesn't go too much into what you should do day to day. It starts off with interesting anecdotes but, by the time I got past those, it was too late to return it. If you are interested in the science aspect, this is written for the layman and is a good read. If you are looking for help/advice, find somethng else - the title is a bit deceiving."
1,Too much flour and water?,"This book is a big disappointment. It reminds me of a stew with too much flour and water. If I put it down I can't recall what the particular point he in the process of making. It is a book that makes me `snow blind'. Maybe I'm just dumb or maybe I have a mind that doesn't relate well to ""touchy feely"" psychobabble. I think people who write self help books should try their chapters out on a panel of people from differing backgrounds for feed back. I threw my hands up at page 164."
4,"Interesting, but unfulfilling","This is an interesting read, but it doesn't come through with total substance. I suggest purchasing, there are other read on the subject that provide more."
4,Positive Psychology and Fear,"A friend recommended this book to me. I have to say that I find the title a little corney, but so far it's a great read. It talks about Positive Psychology and how our brains are geared towards avoidance from fear. If we can learn to overcome our instinct of fear, we can be truly free. Diggin it so far."
2,Hhmmmm,"As an already happy person, I enjoyed reading the stories and felt they were written from the heart. Sometimes one has to work hard at happiness and Dr. Baker points that out, but what I found so distracting was that even though he acknowledges God, he makes constant references to evolution which in itself is a contradiction. I will put a few of his directives to practice, but I really couldn't suggest someone taking precious time to read this book."
5,A Wonderful Book!,"WHAT HAPPY PEOPLE KNOW is a real wake-up call -- an invaluable treatise on graciously accepting the best parts of who we are and building on them in order to gain a true appreciation of how wonderful life can -- and should -- be. I've been in a bit of a funk lately and Dr. Baker's book seems to have launched me right out of it. A ""must read"" for anyone looking to fall back in love with life."
4,Painting China for Pleasure and Profit,"Ms. Ruth was well known for her roses. She was very good at painting them, I have a DVD of her's that is about roses. This book answers the questions that I had with the DVD, If you want to learm how to paint roses, this is the book to get. If on the other hand you want to paint something else, this book will not cover it, it is only about roses. I have a signed copy from Amazin of this book, and she is now desesed, I'm glad that I have a signed copy now."
3,Good Book on the Hindenburg,The book was delivered on time and is large with both drawings and photo's. My grandson loved it.
5,Great for woman who live in areas with high humidity,I worked as a stylist in New Orleans and was introduced to Moisturee by another stylist who had worked for Mastey while she was living in California. I used this conditioner on myself first and then introduced it to my customers. I loved it because it didn't leave the hair limp. Humidity is a big problem for us in the south and its hard to find a good conditioner that works for us. 20 years later - I still feel its a great conditioner.
5,HAIR PRODUCT,A VERY GOOD HAIR PRODUCT; JUST A SMALL AMOUNT IS NEEDED EACH TIME YOU CONDITION YOUR HAIR. WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO OTHER PEOPLE.
3,Lasted 14 months,I purchased this item on 11/18/07 and received/installed it a few days later. The battery is dead as of 1/29/09. My APC BF350 is plugged in 24/7. I expected this battery to last as long as the original battery did (4 years).
4,Works great,"This product performs to its specification. I am using it now in my UPS. Installation was easy and my UPS has never performed better. This is a good way to keep from buying a whole new unit, which can cost upward of $50."
4,Great read on Decatur and the early Navy,"First, I'm a fan of military history and biographies, so my review may be slightly skewed. The book was an easy read (relatively short at 260 pages) and gives a mildly detailed account of Decatur's life and unfortunate death. I recommend this book to any service member, especially those in our Navy since besides introducing one of their greatest commanders it also presents some of the history leading to the establishment of a permanent Naval force during the early years of our nation. The only thing missing from this book are maps of the regions as they were known at the time and perhaps a tiny glossary with the definitions to the Naval/Nautical terms used."
3,"interesting ""rare"" piece of Nazi propaganda!","I have a copy of the 1937 version in German intended to appeal and address those of German American Heritage in regards to the Reich , and the SPCA charity book sale of course would have charged me more than a dollar for it if they knew what it was. Max Otto Koilchwitz was an American whom might have been charged with treason if he hadn't died due heart failure from complications of tuberculosis on August 31, 1944. Living abroad in Berlin in 1940 he probably had a quite intimate relationship with another American working for German State Radio named Mildred Gillars, whom became known by the American forces as ""Axis Sally""One does not need to know much German to understand Koilchwitz's promotion of how the Reich powers created Germany and Austria into the ideally beautiful European country to travel to abroad, as well as possessing the latest engineered transportation technology systems to use for travel within."
4,Thought this was the Cover album,"Thought this was the Cover album. I was pleasantly surprised when I ordered it that this was classic Lou Reed. Although there are a couple of misses on the album, one of the more memorable pieces are 'How Do you Speak to an Angel' ... absolutely awesome. 'Rock and Roll Heart' is old fashioned rock all the way.""Legendary Hearts' is another great tune. The majority of these tunes are very good. If you like Lou Reed, you'll like this album"
2,Not even close.....,"Although a great idea, this concept should never have been released to the greater public. Featuring only two lines by Reed himself, this is just a slew of rock stars, including greats such as David Bowie, Bono (U2), and others, mixed with Luciano Pavaratti, singing one line apiece for a fund-raiser. Each star, blurbing their given line, ruin the entire meaning of the song, and would give a first time listener of ""Lou Reed"" a terrible, terrible memory. This should be for the dearest of Reed/Bowie/etc. fans only."
5,"finally, a resident evil clone that is scary and fun!","when resident evil came out on the PSX, dozens of clones like parasite eve came out. But until like 1998 when silent hill came out and so did resident evil 2 came out. and silent hill is scarier and more fun to play because you control the camera angles. And the thing i like about this game is that if you press the L2 button, the camera will go right behind harry. And you got a nice arsenal of weapons like chainsaws, rock drills, guns, knives, axes, hammers and more. plus it has twilight zone endings. I wont tell you them. overall if you're a resident evil or a survival horror fan, you owe it to check out the silent hill series."
5,Incredible,"Being a huge horror fan, I (of course) went right to horror/survival games with the onset of Resident Evil. Similar to those is Silent Hill. Very dark and very creepy. The game is superb and I couldn't put it down. The background and music are haunting and all the corpses laying around will end up making you jumpy if you play it alone at night. On the downside, the character runs/moves very slow so it is hard to counter attacks and the camera goes crazy with stupid angles when you are moving through various layouts. Of course with a bit of play you get used to it and it becomes a minor issue."
5,Great videography and music.,"Really enjoyed this Blu-Ray. Wonderful photography and music. Very affordable, and perfect background music/entertainment for the holidays. Even contains two seperate sound tracks to listen to with the video. All in all very peaceful to watch."
1,"Great subject, bad video production","I've been video production for some 40 years, I've seen a lot! The stained windows themselves and the churches they are in are great, but the production used to show them made me cringe. Zoom, after zoom with no rhyme or reason. No thought as to pacing of the shots, or length of any of them.Just when we got in close to a window that really looked interesting, we were whisked away to another, leaving me saying, ""wait, I wanted to look at that!"" Many of the church interiors looked interesting, but we we only caught glimpses of them - not long enough to digest what were were seeing.Yes, the technical quality was great, and the music fine, but I stopped the video before it was finished. Someday I'll go back and try to get through it all. So sad..."
4,A travelogue but cheaper than a ticket!,This is a great addition to the holiday library or for any time you need inspirational assistance. Just remember it was man who made and installed these without any unseen assistance. There are two versions on the one disc and are both pleasing to watch and listen to.
3,Pretty images and music,"This is a good deal if you don't mind having the HD DVD disc, which is pretty much useless to most people since it won't work on a Blu-Ray player (I tried it). You still get the standard DVD, which will pretty much play on any machine, and it looks fine. As far as content goes, these ambient type discs are good for gatherings where people are talking too much to follow a narrative, but it does give them something to look at and talk about. The music is nice, and you can even turn off your TV and just listen if you want to. I have to say, I wish one of these companies would put a little more effort into making the video more interesting. How about a DVD with just images and music that's so interesting you can sit and watch the whole thing by yourself without getting bored?"
3,Want more than windows,"The music is good. But we were disappointed to see only stained glass windows. There are beautiful churches and cathedrals in the world -- we'd have appreciated seeing some of them. Window after window can get boring, even if they are of a wonderful soul"
1,Unhearable soundtrack!,"The SD version looks and sounds fine. However, I've tried two totally different copies of this disc and both of them had unhearable soundtracks on the HD side of the disc. The sound continually sputters throughout the entire movie. Since I own over 40HD-DVDs and this is the only one that has this problem, I have to assume there is a problem with this particular title. Even with this very serious defect, I've decided to keep the disc and use just the visual portion of it. I can play Christmas CDs at the same time I'm enjoying the beautiful High-Def visuals. I sure hope the company that produces this excellent movie can figure out how to fix this disc."
1,Stained Glass Christmas with Heavenly Choirs,"This DVD came in completely unusable. It wouldn't play on any DVD player we had. It is definitely defective and I am too old to go through the motions of bringing it to the post office, mailing it back for a refund and paying the postage too. I just will never buy from any dealer on line except Amazon, New product to make sure I have an easier contact.Lucy Friedman"
1,Glass,Most disappointing to purchase a Blu-ray DVD of Christmas carols expecting to see a choir singing only to be confronted with slowly changing images of stained glass windows in unidentified churches/cathedrals
5,Cool!,"Picked this up for something different to play at Christmas. Wife had a work party and a lot of older people showed up, figured this would be the perfect thing to have on in the background and I was right, everyone loved it. I think older people and religious people especially will like this. There are two different music options to play while watching the video."
3,"I truly, truly love you.","The Four Lovers were an early incarnation of the Four Seasons. They had one chart single back in 1956, ""You're the Apple of My Eye"", which managaged to reach #62 on the national charts. This CD collects all 25 songs they recorded for RCA Records (all in 1956), plus six alternate takes. The group released five singles for RCA, plus an album that didn't include any songs that were released as singles. This is solid mid '50s rock and roll. It sounds a lot like the Four Seasons, but with a '50s rock sound, and Frankie Valli didn't use his falsetto voice as often on these recordings. Very enjoyable early rock and roll, although not as good as the Four Seasons classics that they started recording six years later."
3,I'm always thinking of you.,"The Four Lovers were an early incarnation of the Four Seasons.

2,Not good for infant/newborn - difficult to suck,"I received these as a gift for my shower and am very disappointed with them because my son (who is now 6 weeks old) doesn't like them at all. He is unable to get his mouth around the nipples properly and they're too hard for him to suck! I've used Gerber nipples with other bottles which he likes and also the Dr. Brown bottles ... are amazing! They reduce gas by removing the bubbles and make him less fussy. I would have bought more of these instead if I had known. Also, my nurse at my hospital told me that infants have problems sucking on the Avent nipples..."
1,"""Violent"" bottles!","We had a terrible experience with Avent bottles. Our son had what we called ""violent"" bottles for the first 6-8 weeks of his life. He would gag and choke and swallow huge gulps of air, then scream until we could get the burp up. We finally figured out it was these bottles! The minute we switched (to a much less expensive kind I should add) he was fine. A pediatrician later told me Avent bottles are often problematic."
3,Talk Pt. 1 DOES include 3 discs!,"The first reviewer wrote that Talk Pt. 1 doesn't include 3CDs (parts 1-3) as he thought, but mine does. I ordered all three parts separately, but now I have two extra discs (2,3) that I don't need.I hope there's a way around the copy protection."
5,Get up to speed on spirits in 600 pages,"There may be more recent books focused on wine or beer, but this is the most comprehensive guide to alcoholic beverages in general. Tired of listening to a couple of colleagues discussing a subject that I knew nothing about, I read this fascinating book, and soon turned the tables: until I showed them evidence, they simply would not believe that Amaretto was made made from apricot pits rather than almonds! Many other products, like Spanish sherry, have interesting details and histories that I had never suspected. About the organization, roughly one-third is devoted to wines (a chapter per country), one-third to other alcoholic beverages, and one-third to technical advice and appendices on menu-planning, storage, vintages, etc. A highly enjoyable and informative book, very nicely balanced."
3,Thorough,"This 1,221 page edition is not easy to carry around with you, but it contains all of Rossetti's extensive poetry, plus a helpful introduction and extensive endnotes. If you want to delve beyond her ""greatest hits"" like ""Goblin Market"" and ""Up-Hill,"" you'll find it all there, including her less popular devotional poems."
2,Turtle.,"This USB is really slow for it's proposed USB 2.0. However, I bought it for $15 so I can't complain; the 2gb storage is stable and it works great.I recently bought a $8 Cruzer 2GB micro and it's blazingly fast compared to this usb. I will be using that one more from now on.One interesting thing to note is that this USB was actually really fast on a certain Dell computer at my school--I have no idea what made it compatible with that PC only. So this may be a compatibility issue (Euro/US?)The design is definitely pretty though; it has a sleek, flat elegance that makes it nice to look at. If time isn't a concern to you, then this may be the USB for you."
1,Waste of Money,"bonsai [noun]: ""A small decorative evergreen shrub or tree grown in a pot, which has been prevented from growing to its usual size by various methods.""The description above is very indicative of why SimpleTech chose the name for this drive that they have. It is diminutive, decorative, and performs at about the same speed as a tree grows! I can't stress this enough. I did some performance comparisons writing 100 MB of data to this drive and other media. Everything I tested smoked this drive in write tests. The closest the BonzaiXpress came to was a CD-RW at 4X speed. If you've ever used a CD-RW you know how slow they are; and yet the CD-RW was TWICE as fast as this drive.I attempted to format the drive today (so that I could give it away) and it died. This drive is so slow that I rarely ever used it and yet it has already malfunctioned. Maybe the length of life and the performance issues are related. Mine is now being recycled and that's about the best thing I can say about this drive."
5,Take Me Away!,Good reads about Spas all over the world. Do wish they would focus more on US spas. Makes me wish I could travel and report on these beautiful places across the globe.
2,What's good and bad about the book,"Good:Calls Jimmy Carter the worst US in modern era times. True with the way JC gave away the Panama Canal and bungled the hostage crises in Iran (which he sorta caused being so extra-weak a leader).Bad (Very bad):Talks about Rudy Giuliani being a good candidate for presidency even though Giulani made sinful homosexuality in NYC (and other places in america) prevelant enough in legal union ways. Romans 1:21-26.Also, it mentions Saddam Hussein but not the Anfal Campaign (Saddam's deadly attempt at Iraqi Kurdish genocide)."
5,"An Excellent book, explaining BC antennas in simple terms.","This book is inexpensive and introduces the concepts employed in broadcast antennas without the use of complicated formulas. It explains the broadcast channel concepts and FCC regulations as they relate to antenna arrays using simple language, and plenty of diagrams and photographs.I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants an introduction to how AM broadcast antenna arrays work. The book can also be a help to those who are educated in electronics, but haven't explored this area in depth."
3,VERY Basic,"I found the book to be VERY basic. If you are a ham, or in the engineering aspect of the broadcast industry there is nothing new to you in this book."
3,My first blues CD,"This was my first blues CD, and it was what got me started to listen more seriously. John Lee remains to be one of my favorite ""old school"" musicians. It was cool to have Bonnie Raitt on there, too."
2,Vastly overrated,"I have a massive John Lee Hooker CD collection, and while a lot of people know ""The Healer"" and it may have introduced many blues lovers to a great artist, the truth is it's hugely overrated and nowhere close to his best album. Hooker is best by himself and, well, younger. Early Hooker is almost always better. This is worth having, but not until you've purchased about 25 other Hooker discs. Even a few of the albums he made after this one are better. Try ""The Legendary Modern Recordings"" and be truly amazed."
5,ATH-EM7GM,"Extremely stylish, pure sound, and very comfortable. They have a cloth-wrap chord with an included matching extension, and they come with a storage case.The headphones are made of a brushed aluminum. Smaller than they look in the picture, not heavy. The earpiece pops out so you can put them on easier, and they can be extended an extra half a centimeter for even more comfort. The wire on the outside is rarely noticeable. Might take a little getting used to, since the design is so different, but once you find the sweet spot, these headphones are great. Definitely good for your money."
4,Loveable earphones,"pros:very stylishoverall good sound qualitycomfortable( I used it for 5 hrs, it's true!)cons:weak bass!!tend to slip (rarely- I guess that's because I have small ears)"
2,Lower sound quality than expected,"These headphones has strong mids and highs (a bit noisy to me anyway) and are very low in bass. Overall impression of sound is very unbalanced. You have to push the phones agains the ear enough to get the sound quality one level up, but... The phones looks very nice and stylish, also comfort is better than expected. But the overall sound quality is not equal to my old Koss PortaPro I wanted to replace. I'm staying with PortaPro in the end :("
5,Great headphones,"i usually go though several pair a month and these have lasted 3 or 4 now. they have good sound and the cloth cable help the wires from shorting.Pros:Cloth cablegood sounddurablecons:ear pieces are very heavyhard to only use one ear as the other side would not clip on shirts very well and it dangling presents some awkwardness as its heavywithout the extension cord, the cord from the headphones is very short"
3,Not worth the green,"The sound is adequate, but the adjustability of the earhook needs to go further down to more closely fit over earcanal. If you want to wear them for working out don't, because they tend to fall away from your ears when laying down.All in all the major complaint is just that they don't fit very good if you have a longer ear."
4,AT over the ear clip on buds,"I thought these looked so cool I figured the sound had to be pretty good and it is. I really like the clip on/over the ear hanger, very comfortable. I have watched several movies on the itouch and never felt fatique or irratation. Not that they would stay in place for a 5k run unless you had a skull cap on but certainly secure enough for a brisk walk. Despite the appearance they are very light. I really like the sound quality, they are crisp and true. But if you like the bass artifically high, these might not be the ticket. Construction is bullet proof, I fully expect these to last forever. Also, by design, there is plenty of sound leak becasue they are meant to let you also hear the surroundings. These were prefect for what I wanted but if you are looking for isolation, you will want a different product."
1,Uncomfortable with lacking sound quality,"I was given these for Christmas, so I can't complain too much, but I wanted to post a review so people won't spend their own money on these things.The clip-on mechanism is uncomfortable no matter where the telescoping arm is set on my ears, and after about a half-hour of wear, they begin to hurt to the point of me not wanting to wear them. The idea of clip-ons makes sense I guess, but the cord is constantly tangled and it's not a very secure fit.As far as sound quality, these are somewhat ""muddy"" sounding headphones. While I'm no audiophile, I am not impressed *at all* with quality.I already ordered a set of Koss Portapros to replace these. It seems that a little bulkiness is worth it over these things. Even Grados SR-60s would be a better buy."
3,Stylish,I love how these look but its definitely a love hate relationship for me. Althought the look awesome they can be a real hassle to put on and take off. Also the cords then to get tangled and there is an extension like plug in the middle which I guess allows to you plug into other devices quickly? I don't know. Sound quality is below average and a lot of outside noise tends to leak in. These will not work if you intend to workout in them. I usually use them while walking or studying. If you can you should definitely try them on before buying. I should mention that these are my second pair because the first pair failed after half a year of use.
4,Not Bad,At first i thought they would not be that good but then i said hey there audio technica so i knew i could trust them and i was right they sound great look great i just like.
4,Kinda nice,everything is good. I just don't like the wire of this earphone. Especially the wire will hang behind your head and it makes the looking a little bit messy. I suppose the wire should be like ipod earphone but it was not...
4,Cathy's Book,"This is a good book, if you are a teen. It has a good storyline, and contrary to popular belief it is not hard to get into. The ""evidence"" in the book makes it more exiting, like you are actually helping solve the mystery, and the twist ending is a real suprise. I would recomend reading the evidence at the begging of the book and at the end but not all through it. You should enjoy the story. It is not nessecary to look at the evidence during the story, which kind of dissapointed me. I thought I would be solving the mystery, not listening to someone solve it. All in all it was a good book, but it was not everthing I expected it to be."
3,Creative time passer,"This is a ""cute"" and interesting book for teens. The reader that has never encountered this type of book before will be pleasantly surprised. The content and writing quality is average, but I think this would be a great gift for a quirky, fun seeking pre-teen!"
4,Stewart/Weisman/Brigg's Book...,"From calling phone numbers to checking evidence, playing detective is the most fun of Cathy's Book. The reader becomes Emma, Cathy's best friend, who is left with a journal filled with numbers, evidence, and a story that will blow your mind!"
3,Okay,"The book was in fine condition, but all the extra stuff that normaly would come inside the book were missing. Where do I make a complaint?"
2,Don't keep your hopes up,"To start with, I have to say when I saw this book at the store, I knew it was not worth buyin (because it is import the price was really high) but I was interested. Anyways, my friend lend it to me few weeks ago, and I read it. The story is quite boring, but readable, however the set up, little notes on the book, the little things that come along with it make it more attractive. I don't recommend you buy it and I certainly recommend you read something more interesting. However, if you already own it you may as well read. (Plus, it can be a great gift for teenage girls.)"
2,Needs Spell & Grammar Checker,"I'm not much of a ""gamer"" so I had trouble getting into the book. However, the poor grammar and terrible spelling throughout the book were disturbing and very distracting. Not a good read, IMO."
4,He's Back,"Nuwine, after a disapointing ""1998"" and ""Ghetto Mission"", finally went back to his original style from ""Da Bloody 5th"". He actually raps on this disc too, which we can't say he did on ""Ghetto Mission"". The beats are tight and the rapping is great. The best tracks are ""My Dog"", which had a Snoop Dogg/C-Murder feel to it, ""Get up"", and ""God Loves Thugs"". But if you don't like phat gangsta tracks, then I suggest you skip this disc."
3,Not enough content,"I took this book out from the library to see if I might like to buy it. I love Barbara Walker's mosaic technique. I think it is immeasurably easier than fair isle because you work with only one strand at a time, and there are no problems with puckering or tangled yarn. I think this author has taken mosaic knitting in a great direction, but I just don't think there is enough content here to warrant a whole book. The crux of the book is to execute the mosaic designs with a varigated yarn. A beautiful technique. She does give great advice for creating your own mosaic designs, but I had already worked one out myself, and learned the pitfalls that way. Her garment patterns are very cute, but are too boxy for my taste. If you don't have Walker, this is a good book to have, but I just didn't think there was enough in this book to warrant its addition to my knitting library."
3,Bird Cage Arrived Warped On One Side,This bird cage arrived slightly damaged. It looks like a lovely bird cage that would make a nice card holder so there's nothing wrong with the item itself if it arrived undamaged. It was just that it came with the one side at the bottom of it warped as if someone had pushed it in. Maybe something heavy was placed on top of the box containing this bird cage in the warehouse or during shipping. I don't know. But I'm now trying to figure out how to contact this seller.I needed this for my wedding in two weeks so I'm not going to have time to fuss with sending it back for a refund right now and ordering a replacement. A little frustrated.
2,disappointed,"I was excited to try this flatiron after reading all the other reviews. However, I found it to be really disappointing. It takes me longer to use this iron on my wet hair than blowdrying and using a regular straightener. My hair is often still wavy after ironing the same spot 4 or 5 times. It also catches and pulls on my hair."
3,Great for the first few months,"I have long, thick, wavy, and slightly frizzy hair. I am always on the look out for quality straighteners at a low price. I owned the Conair CS26JCS wet/dry straightener for about 6 months until it stopped heating up. Up until that point, I loved the straightener. I'm not sure how long this product says it's suppose to last but if it's used everyday, it's definitely not going to last you more than 6 months- not unless, you want to keep going over what you just straightened because it didn't hold."
1,Takes less time (with better results) if you blow dry and then straighten,"If I shower in the morning, I have to blow dry my hair and then straighten it (because my other straightener is only for dry hair), so I thought this would be great. Sadly, it does only an okay job of straightening if my hair is damp or dry already, and it takes forever to dry your hair if it's more than just a tad damp. It takes far less time - plus I get far better results - if I blow dry and then straighten. I really, really wanted this to work, but it's not worth it."
4,A Good Purchase,"For the price, you can't beat this. Just keep in mind that it's not completely ceramic, only ceramic coated. A better one will cost more money."
2,Disappointed,It was fine at first... just used it a few times... but now it's broken already!!! :( i didn't drop it or anything it just won't heat up anymore. :(
5,Company off set the problem,My daughter was happy with the straightener. And the company did off set for the missing manual. I greatly appricate that.
2,Damages Hair,"I've had this product for a very long time, and I've tried and tried to work with it. It works pretty well, but you have to go through your hair multiple times. It heats up quickly, but it damages hair and leaves it looking fried rather than luscious!"
5,Great crates for travel or home,"Purchased two of these for my little friends (under 15 lbs.) for traveling. Extremely easy to set up & take down. Quite roomy - could have put both in one, if necessary. The photo of item shows one color, but I received tan. Definitely recommend"
2,6lb dog ripped seams,"In an attempt to crate train our puppy, we used this crate. She ripped the seams (which seemed strong), escaped and managed to poop all over the room. If you have a willfull animal, go with a plastic crate."
5,Light-Weight and So Attractive,"Wow, am I ever glad that I purchased this crate for my medium-sized dog! He loves his new ""condo""--so much better than the older crate he had, due to the sides of the crate that welcome air flow. A superb purchase for a pet's comfort!"
1,Zipper broke!,"I bought this Port-A-Crate to have something soft sided that would fit in the back of my Jeep Wrangler. It worked nicely for about 2 weeks,and my boxer loved it. However the big front zipper track was wavy and now is broken. The crate is useless."
5,Better sleep for Mommy,"Easily set up. My 9 year old Yorkie accepted the bed easily, after sleeping in my bed for 6 months. He was previously crate trained. This crate is oversized for my 11 pound (taller - not fatter) dog. The smaller size would probably have been fine, but I am pleased with this. Quality is excellent. I agree that this would not be practical for a dog that was a chewer or scratcher. I am very pleased with the weight and design and quality of this item."
5,So Practical,"I am very happy with this portable dog crate. It is well built and very easy to put up and take down. It's also a perfect size for my senior Australian Shepard but would also work for a larger dog. She likes it a lot. Nice and cozy, light and practical. A great value too. Not priced out of this world."
4,Smells Bad/Company Will Replace!,"As others have written, this product really smells awful out of the box. I used an entire bottle of Simple Green, scrubbed it lightly with a brush, rinsed with water and have left it in the sun to dry and ""off gas"". I am certain that a day or two outside and it will be OK.It looks sturdy enough to contain my dogs, but if you have an animal that digs and chews, this won't hold 'em.I suspect the mfg knows of the problem and is offering them at a substantial discount. 10 minutes with some Simple Green to simply save some green works for me!UPDATE--Crate still smelled after treating and sitting in the sun for 3 days. I called the parent company and was VERY impressed by the great customer service. They are sending me a new cover [my frame is fine] at NO CHARGE! They said that the odor comes from the PVC coating and is not harmful. Only some of the crate covers have this problem, according to the rep. Again, excellent service."
3,Terrible chemical smell.,"From a functional standpoint, this crate would have been fine for using for our puppy in the car while he's small. However, it arrived smelling like chemicals, and even after leaving it outside for a few days, it didn't lose the smell. For the price, it wasn't worth returning - we ended up putting it down by the curb with a ""Free"" sign. It was snapped up immediately. :-)"
5,Excellent buy,This is a fantastic buy. I love the portability and the collapsability of this carrier. I just wish the windows were a little bigger. It's sturdier than I expected.
2,AWFUL chemical smell!!!! sadly ruins solid product,"I hope that I am able to modify this review because I really would like to give this product a higher rating BUT the odor is so awful that if it doesn't dissipate soon I will have to return it. My dog will not stay inside it because of the horribly strong odor. I can't blame her and won't make her because I can't stand having it near me either! The design and quality of the product seems really good and would suit my needs for a lightweight, portable and collapsible crate. It's unfortunate that more attention wasn't paid to the materials used....dogs sense of smell is much more acute then humans."
5,Great!,"I bought this for when I first got my puppy and made it into her pee pad area while we were training, was brilliant. It collapsed simply, but takes a bit of force which is good you know it'd never collapse accidently on an animal."
5,Greatest!,"My dog is very fussy, but has loved it from the start. When we travel he knows to get in his house and he just lays down untill we get where we are going, and he can see out of the front and sides."
4,Good Choice,"Bought this for our new puppy, a Shichon. It works great for our in-house crate, and it took her no time at all to feel comfortable in it, as you can unzip the top and be able to insert your hand so that she knows you are there. Love the flexibility of putting her in through the top or through the front opening and like the fact that she can see out from all sides. It is easy to set up and take down as well as very easy to clean. Definitely a good choice for traveling. I would recommend to anyone trying to crate train their dog."
5,Great Pet Carrier,"I bought this carrier to take my cats to the vet. It's a small carrier & my cat fits in there with a little room as long as they are laying down. The carrier is very sturdy & my cats love to lay in there just to chill out. There is no shoulder strap. But, I don't think that'll really be an issue since the carrier is made for small pets. I am very happy I bought this carrier!"
3,Works!,"This crate works, but not very tall. Already have the Firstrax Port a Crate, green model. That is a MUCH stronger crate. Wish I had bought that one instead. The frame work on the E2 is pretty light weight."
4,"Great for car, a bit big","We got this for our new puppy, and it's great for the car, but it's still big. Doesn't fit nicely into a corner. Seems pretty sturdy except for the one time he decided to try to dig his way out. Otherwise, sturdy construction and well made. We plan to take it as his ""away from home"" crate when we travel."
1,Absolutely horrible... do not waste your money!!!!,I bought this for my 2yr old 4lb chihuahua. She needed a new crate to hang out in during the day and this looked like a great replacement. Boy was I wrong! The first day she chewed a hole in the mesh door and managed to get one of her claws stuck in it. We kept it thinking that she would get used to it. Well now the hole is large enough for her to get through and I guess I will be heading back to the store to buy a plastic replacement. :(
5,Better Than Expected!!,"I purchased this product for my 1yr old Chihuahua- Khloe. She had one that I purchased from a Pet Supply store which cost me an arm & a leg and the top would always collapse. When I received this product it was very easy to pop open and I put her blanket in and she climbed right in without hesitating and would not get out. It is the perfect size and she can stand up, poof & get comfortable with no problem. She is 4lbs fully grown and fits perfectly in it. Love It!!!!"
3,Not portable,"I guess I could have seen from the picture, but I did assume (from the name) that the crate would come with a handle. Unfortunately it is only portable when folded down and can be held with the strap that binds it flat. There is no way to carry this crate with an animal inside it."
1,Poor Quality,My 18lb Silky terrier mix ripped the seams around the zipper in less than 15 minutes and escaped from this crate.
5,My dog sleeps in it every night,"We also use it for traveling. But haven't left him alone in it yet to see if he will chew his way out. Very possible. But for supervised or non chewing dogs, it should be great. I have a greyhound mix and he fits easily. Also VERY easy to assemble and disassemble."
2,Temporarily served its purpose,My 10 pound maltipoo was able to rip through both sides of the crate. I kept turning it against a wall or object but he just ripped through the other side. I was using it for a vacation - so I just threw it out at the end of the trip.
4,DON'T TELL MY KITTY SHE SEES OUT OF A BONE WINDOW,THIS IS A NICE CARRIER. IT IS HARD TO PUT TOGETHER THOUGH....BUT DOES FOLD DOWN FOR EASY STORAGE..GAVE ENOUGH ROOM FOR SMALL CAT...CAT BED...WATER AND FOOD...HAS SEAT BELT NOTCH FOR SAFETY OF PET.
5,This is Perfect for my Pups!,"Very Durable!Easy to carry.WashableI really like having the two openings, Top and Front.Nice size Windows they can see out."
4,Love the fact it is easy to store,I have 5 solid carriers but wanted one that was portable for my cat when we go to a Motel.
2,"Cheap, yes- in more ways than one","I bought this as a travel crate that we could use when bringing our metal crate wasn't an option. We've only used this product about 3-4 times with our 7 month old puppy that is used to being in a crate. The top bars that stabililize the roof became broken. They have a sliding, pull back and release motion that connects two rods to form the top roof bars. These pull back, plastic mechanisms broke at the factory bolt. I have no idea if this is even capable of being repaired. Needless to say, I am very dissappointed in the crate's performance under little to no use in 3 set up/take downs. I take care of my things and have not been rough with this crate in any way. I think it is cheaply made. I'd rather spend more money in hindsight and buy a better brand. I have an email into the company, but doubt that I will get anywhere with it."
5,Great crate for a crate trained dog!,"I originally purchased the Firstrax Port-A-Crate for my 13 year old Border Collie - she was getting into anything and everything at night. We also have a 5 year old Bull Terrier who was crate trained since puppyhood. As soon as I set the crate up (VERY easy, by the way, despite some reviews I read), Tucker, the Bull Terrier, claimed it as his own. I would not recommend this product for an untrained dog,as it could easily chew or scratch its' way out. Our crate trained dog is very happy with his little 'den'- we just leave the flap open so he can come and go as he pleases. Betsy the Border Collie is now in the wire crate, as she is an escape artist. All in all, this is a great product for a dog that wants a space of its' own."
2,Basset Hound Chewed Her Way Out!,"Although I love the look of this crate compared to the ugly metal bar ones, my basset hound chewed through the front (where it zips close) the very first time I put her in it, and it is now of no use to me. Would be great for a small dog or any dog who does not have separation anxiety, but if your dog freaks out when you leave and hates to be in a crate, I would not suggest getting this; they WILL find a way out of it. I have to suck it up and get one of the ugly metal ones.."
2,Firstrax Port-A-Crate E2,I have a 6 month old Morkie that just chewed her way out of this crate after less than 2 hrs in it this morning starting with the velcro. My other dog of the same breed never chews so this is perfect for her. If you have a pup that chews avoid this crate. 5 Stars for a non chewing dog! Very expensive for what I have now! :(
2,Initially Liked it,Don't leave a puppy in it for any long periods of time. I bought this literally 4 days ago for my puppy to sleep in at night next to my bed and he chewed a hole right through the mesh.
4,"Well made, but the 28"" folds up smaller","I actually snagged a 28"" version of this from a local store for a quick trip before this one arrived. For some reason I didn't think that the 28"" would fold up differently - and it actually folds smaller because the length folds in half. I'm sending the 24"" back and keeping the 28"" because it'll be easier to travel with. My pups love it and I absolutely LOVE the top opening! Very well made!"
4,She loves it,"We are happy with this cozy crate and would have given it five stars except for the chemical smell when we opened the box and set it up. But we were patient and let the crate sit out on the patio for several days. It was probably about ten days before the strong scent left. Now our 27 pound sheltie is happy to spend naps and nights in this attractive 28"" lightweight crate. So much better than a cage."
3,Quality and Design flaws found,"The material in the unit I received had some discolored spots in the material and some stitching flaws.Hopefully, both are just cosmetic and won't be a problem since I'm using it for indoor containment for our two cats when we have visitors, and not transport.The unit is large and even when folded down or in the box, requires more space than a typical closet has available.I'm guessing the manufacturer didn't design it to fold down smaller because it would be too weak.I find it's strong enough that our cats can jump on top of it and take a nap without making the material sag. For the times when I zip them inside, turning the unit upside down puts the mesh windows at a height where they can see better whether they're sleeping or standing. The bone shaped mesh windows are cute, but the shape makes them less useful as windows for smaller animals."
1,It had clearly been returned as defective before I received it,This crate would have been a great product had the item not been clearly already opened and then returned as defective. The support pieces at rhe top of the crate will not fully engage and the zipper around the front door is too tight to fully close. Unfortunatly I was in need of a crate immediately and could not return the item myself as I would have liked. I have a similar crate in a smaller size that I use and find no fault with. I am disappointed that the company would allow a returned item to be sent out without examining it fully.
2,port-a-crate e-2,something needs to be done about the mesh to make it stronger on the door. Both the ones I have owned the zipper was all wavy - did not last long at all - the house itself was okay but the door SUCKS
3,"Cozy, but flawed","We bought this crate for our growing golden retriever puppy. My only complaint is that they put velcro strips inside the mesh door, so that when you rolled it up, it could attach to the top of the crate. However, my puppy chewed both velcro strips off, causing holes in the doors on either sides. Whenever she gets anxious in her crate she tries to make the holes larger. Other than that, it's been great. I would recommend putting ties on the inside and outside of the door on the top of the crate, so you could roll up the door and tie it up."
4,a nice crate for the money,It's a nice crate for the money. I would like bigger side windows but that is just my personal preference since I live in Texas.
1,bad zippers,"We put our min-pin in the crate and she (all 10# if her) walked right out of the bottom of of the zipper, did not slow her down.We gave it to the humane society for their use."
2,"Between the dogs and trying to put it together, it's trashed.",Purchased this for a 2wk vacation and needed a portable kennel. Brace on the inside broke while trying to put it together on the first try. By the time 2 weeks were over? Unusable. The dogs decided to chew through it as well. I have two Boston Terriers under 12lbs each. :(
1,Can't zip it up anymore after two weeks,"Well I did like how light weight this crate was and how it was kind of like a pop up tent. Im giving it a bad rating because I have only had it maybe two weeks and our new dog chewed the zipper up and it will not close at all anymore so its completely useless. I didn't think she would be able to destroy the thing from the inside out but she did it. I will now have to spend even more money and just get a metal crate like I should have done in the first friggen place. If your dog chews stuff at all or you even have the slightest notion it will try and escape the crate then do not buy this doggy tent, buy a real crate made of metal."
5,Great sturdy carrier,This is a great buy for a sturdy little carrier that holds strong for my cat!! The top and sides open up and the side can be left open for a kennel option for your dog/cat. For the price this is well worth it!
1,Won't hold a French Bulldog,"I have a 27 pound French Bulldog young dog who I bought this crate for. The first time the crate worked great. The second time in about 5 minutes she had managed to rip through the canvass material and was free. I sewed up the over 12 inch rip. I put the Frenchie in again and in less then 5 minutes she ripped a new hole in the canvass and was out again. This crate was suppose to hold a dog up to 70 pounds,yet it didn't hold a 27 pound French Bulldog. I was very, very disappointed. The quality of material was obviously poor. I would not recommend this product."
1,Wrong item sent twice,"I ordered the Port-A-Crate Model E-24 for $29.95 with free shipping from Amazon in May. The carrier I received was not the one I ordered although it had a tag on it that said it was Model E-24. It did not have a carrying handle which the picture on the website indicated it did. I called and was treated very respectfully and assured a replacement would go out that day with fast shipping. I took the first carrier back to the post office. Yesterday, the replacement arrived AND IT WAS THE WRONG ONE AGAIN! This time when I called, the person on the phone said my account would be credited with a refund as soon as both items arrived. No further discussion or effort to clear up the mistake. Be wary of purchasing this item."

5,"An amazing book on AI, number theory, music, and logic","I've always been facinated by the concept of artificial intelligence, and when someone told me how good this book was I went out and bought it, and while I was reading it you could not pry it from my hands it was so interesting. Every chapter you learn at least one thing. It constantly sets you thinking. I was amazed at the connection between goedels theory, escher's art and bach's muxic with it's infinitly repeating themes. And the tortise and hare's in between chapter dialogue really helps you understand the complex concepts."
2,Dying binding,When i received this book it was covered in a yellowish dust. It was the binding glue which had dried to the extent that it was just flaking off. The cover was already a 1/4 of the way off. Normally the small 1/2 inch rip in the cover wouldnt bother me but with the binding condition it's just an extra insult. This book should have not been sent out
2,hyperbole,"one of these reviews said Chris Genoa has a talent for hyperbole; i'd suggest that these stratospheric reviews have a talent for hyperbole that far outmatches Genoa. this was a just kind of funny book, more weird than funny, un-compelling plot, disorganized storytelling, and a depressing ending. i read it, but it was easy not to pick it up for days at a time, and i was as likely to groan as i was to chuckle. Overrated."
2,Start strong but fades terribly towards the end,"Foop! which is Poof backwards, is one of those books that has a lot of hype to it in the underground media. In other words it's got a lot of Buzz! due to it's very loose construction. The story itself is weak and reminds me of one of those television shows on Fox/UPN/The WB/The CW that has a 'cute' plot but nowhere to go after you get past the original premise.The book is in three parts, and it's interesting that the first part is more than half the books length (170 of 293 pages) and the last part is the shortest of the three. I got the feeling that he got to the point where he didn't know where to go so he just ended it.So starts with a bang, and fizzles out at the end."
1,Unrewarded tedious work of a read,"OK, I was drawn to this by comparison. I like oddball, offbeat authors. This was a disappointment. It never actually got anywhere. This reads like a stream of consciousness that went unedited. I have to say this is a first effort and is worthy of an undergraduate writing program. But, I don't understand why they had to published it. I say read this author's 4th book. He should have it by then. If you are the author, throw away your next three books and start working on the 5th. I'd like to see more stories developed in the subtext. Try reading Robbins or Ruff, you'll have more fun."
2,gimme a break,"This book didn't suck, but I didn't ""laugh out loud"" till I checked these reviews. Gimme a break. This is lowbrow comedy written between bong hits in his parent's basement, and very lttle more. Pynchon? Beckett? SHAKESPEARE??? No, no, and certainly not. This is neither masterful comedy nor a touching book. It gave me a few chuckles, when I could figure out what was going on, but if Genoa hits you high and low with equal force, he doesn't strike any higher than the kneecaps.Aw shucks, maybe I'm being unfair. It's his first book, and I can see potential. Go in with low expectations, and you might be amused, but don't expect to be inspired."
2,Flop!,"Disappointing. Nothing like Chris Moore. Foop is funny the way the kid in the back of 3rd grade making fart noises with his armpits was funny. Amusing, kind of, but ultimately immature, self-impressed, and gross."
3,Kilgore Trout Anyone?,"Chris Genoa's debut novel is very Vonnegut-esque although some of the criticism I've read in other reviews is somewhat accurate. It was a very good read and very funny, especially because I have a penchant for monkeys. What could be funnier than a blind, chain-smoking monkey with a pre-disposition for hog-tying. I couln't help thinking of the sometimes mindless wanderings of Kilgore Trout in ""Venus on the Half Shell."" Disturbingly awkward at times and I believe, like Vonnegut, that the genius is in the nonsensical meanderings. Looking forward to his next works."
3,"On a good day maybe 4 stars, but not today.","Here is what happens in this book. odd,odd,odd,hahaha,cricket,cricket,cricket, over and over. There are some very funny parts, some very odd parts and some very boring parts. Then the anti climatic ending left me feeling ripped off. There were several times that I was reminded of Robert Rankin and Chuck Palahniuk but it seems as if there was no follow through in his thinking."
5,My kind of funny,"Were you one of the people that laughed at the bathroom scene in Dumb and Dumber? Do you think Family Guy is ""One of the best shows ever""? You're going to like this book! I was laughing most of the way through it. Most of this laughing was out loud, and not just little giggles either. Hard laughing, with things coming out of my body...did I go too far with that? oh well. You'll forget about it friend...sorry for the visual.If you don't enjoy some dirty jokes, (not all about the nature of your body I might add!) and are one of the people that need the laughter of a studio audience to know what and when to chuckle....this might not be for you. That's fine. You've been warned."
5,Wicked Funny,"This book is the absurdly funny tale of a Joe who is a time traveling tour guide. Joe's task is the go back in time and find out who has been traveling back in time and torturing his boss.I loved it! This is black comedy Monty Python style, it's dark, witty, surreal and raucously fun. If you are into Douglas Adams, Christopher Moore, Terry Gilliam or any of the other comparisons people have made, I think you will appreciate Chris Genoa's brand of bizarro comedy."
3,Amusing - but no Chistopher Moore,"I purchased this based on the Amazon recomendation. It was favorably compared to Christopher Moore's books. My assessment may be colored by the expectations set in comparing it to Christopher Moore. However, while it is mildly amusing, I found it to be a tedious read. The main character induges in far to much introspection which is not all that amusing nor does it seem to facilitate the plot line. I would recomedn it as worthy airplane reading, but I wouldn't go out of my way to get another Chris Genoa book based on my experience with this one."
2,Overdone,"To begin with, I'd like to say that the pretense for the book was great, and could have been a brilliant novel. Perhaps I went in with expectations that were too high, hearing the names Douglas Adams, Kurt Vonnegut, and Samuel Beckett (all of whom I love) thrown around. Unfortunately, I felt like the book relied too deeply on toilet humor and took the self-depreciation to the level of pathos, not humor. Also, I felt as though I was reading and Instant Messenger conversation instead of a novel. The all-caps sentences gave me a headache more than anything. All in all, it simply felt like Foop! was trying to hard for its own good."
1,The best thing about this book is you can read it in one day.,I was extremely disappointed with this book. There were some clever moments and a few chuckles but overall it seemed somewhat pointless and shockingly amateurish (numerous grammatical errors). At times I felt like I was reading a college student's freshmen level Creative Writing project.To compare this book to those of Christopher Moore or Douglas Adams is an insult.Don't waste your time.
3,Second Rate Douglas Adams,"Foop! is clever and imaginative, but it suffers from poor editing as the flow can be rather rough. The quality of the printed page is also cheap looking, as if the publisher employed a lesser printing method than the established norm. I believe the author could develop into a Douglas Adams for the new millenium, but the sad thing is that with better editing, he might already be there and more."
2,A great book... for an undergrad,"I think that Chris Genoa is going to be an excellent writer once he takes some more writing classes (or actually pays attention to them), or hires a really good editor. There was a lot going for the book, but not nearly enough to hold it together. Genoa is unfortunately a little too enamoured of himself and his own sense of humor to fully flesh out the story. That being said, I think he has a lot going for him (hell, his reviewers alone were enough to make me pick up the book, although I questioned their taste a bit afterward), and once he matures a bit and his writing style coalesces, I think he will really be a writer worth reading."
1,Not at all what I expected or hoped for,"What a disappointment. After reading the first chapter of this book and observing that Christopher Moore enjoyed it, so I ordered it and thought it was going to be great. Well it went from great, to bad to worse very quickly. I made it through 3/4 of the book and finally said I can't go on. There is nothing creative about this book just a bunch of mumble jumble that makes no sense and you feel stupider for reading in. Im really surprised with all the positive reviews because I really struggled to read it and it shouldn't even be compared to christopher Moore's work."
4,Interesting writing + crazy humor = awesomeness,"Foop! is like what would have happened if Hunter S. Thompson decided to write a science fiction book. It's a really strange trip that's filled with great comedic moments. Read it for the journey and humor, and not necessarily the plot.And do not be mistaken: this truly is cult fiction, not mainstream. Think Chuck Palahniuk and Augusten Burroughs because it has a similar ""confessional memoir"" tone). There's a touch of Douglas Adams in there, but this book has much more of an American feeling to be considered British satire.Kids in high school and young adults in college will absolutely eat this book up, as will others with a taste for the weird. It has cult classic written all over it."
2,Ok but not great,"Foop! starts off on a strong note, but it too convinced of its own wit to be anything more than a disappointment.It should have been more entertaining and it's trying so hard to be.A Douglas Adams-like story about the absurdities surrounding time travel and its implication, Foop! never lives up to its early promise. The middle lags a lot and I figured out where the story was headed long before the main characters did. Whether it's because I've read a bit of these type of stories in the past or it was just a bit too predictable I'm not sure."
1,Disappointed,"I purchased this book based on the Amazon recommendation and the Christopher Moore blurb on the cover. My favorite authors are Christopher Moore and Tom Robbins, and I am always looking to add to my list. The absurdity of this book wasn't ""good absurdity;"" it wasn't entertaining nor funny, rather it was annoying. The characters were for the most part flat, and when they weren't they were repetitive and dull (in an irritating way). The plot was almost random, yet had feeble attempts to go somewhere with the phony guru, the paranoia, and the ""well, screw you all, Earth's gonna be destroyed 'cuz humans are such losers,"" motif. If you read for humor, entertainment, enlightenment, grand use of the language, and rich characterization, skip this and save your money; you'll be glad you didn't waste your cash or time."
2,"Pretty good, up to a point","This is a pretty good book. The story is creative and really made me wonder what was going on, or what was going to happen next, which I liked. However, the end was weak. Extremely weak, in fact. I would suggest reading this book, but stopping before the last 3 chapters and making up your own ending. It's like the author just started writing, with no structured plot in mind at all, and then he didn't know how to wrap up details of the earlier plot points.There were also many, many editing issues. There were at least two (to) instances where the word ""to"" was used when the word ""too"" should have been used. There were also spelling issues in the book.I would have suggested a little more effort in the plot and some more time editing, then this could have been a really good book instead of just ok.I will still read his future works to see if things have gotten better as I feel that he has great potential."
4,"I hope what just came out my nose was milk, and not my brain.","Oddly enough the strange machine that is Amazon reccomended this book to me, and I am so glad it did. I read it and laughed out loud several times. I kept reading lines out loud to my roomates, because I found it so funny. I then made them all read it, even though I had already read them half of the damn thing out loud. Very funny, silly, with great use of illustrations. The only reason I gave it a four star instead of a five is that I felt (personally) that Mr. Genoa missed an opportunity to really go somewhere with the ending. It was still great, but I think the ending could have been a bit more...I don't know. For a first book, amazing. I will read his next one fore sure. I mean, c'mon, hog-tying chain-smoking monkeys? Classic. Since I evacuated from New Orleans when I read it, I found the predictions for that city to be quite creepy. I refuse to give more away. Just read the book...or we'll send a monkey after you."
3,Foop,"I admit I bought Chris Genoa's ""Foop"" strictly because I liked Christopher Moore's ""Fluke"" and ""Lamb"". I'm not sure I see the relation to the two after reading ""Foop"".I didn't think ""Foop"" was as laugh-out-loud funny as other reviewers would have you believe. It is a bizarro science fiction sort of story. It's also very confusing at times. Now if that's your cup of tea, cool, you'll love it.(Side note: I noted a few spelling errors/grammar mistakes. That sort of thing should not be happening in a published book.)On the positive side, the book was definitely a memorable read. The main character Joe is very annoying and a total loser; however, I liked some of the other weirder, unique characters.Overall, I think ""Foop"" is a promising debut, but definitely not a 5-star book unless you're really into the sci-fi sort of thing."
3,Interesting...,"From the beginning of this book, I was completely engaged! It was surreal, comic, and almost felt like a text version of an animation. However, the story indulges itself as it progresses and loses focus. I read the first half in a few days and the second half took me a month to get through..."
3,Downright Odd,"The premise is way over in the far, far future. A totally paranoid guy, Joe, is the main character who works as a tour guide at a time travel private company. Daily, groups of people are taken back into time to experience historical phenomena such as the assassination of Abraham Lincoln which actually commences the novel in a very promising way. The language is quite horrid most of the time and the dialogues mediocre. Joe could be categorized as a somewhat obsessive compulsive or he might just possess weird notions of things and of people. He is quick to name objects around him which is quite funny. Each character is bizarre and the happenings flippant. On the whole, the story has a good plot but because of the excessive ranting and raving, I couldn't contain my interest in the story for long. It becomes quite tiresome but it does end up being a fast and easy read."
5,Bizarro!,"Chris Genoa is, as advertised, a literary lunatic. And if he keeps writing bizarro books like this he'll be my favorite writer in no time flat. Someone recommended this book to fans of Adult Swim cartoons, and I can see why. Foop! has a lot of that same brand of crazy humor you'd find in those cartoons, but with a nice literary touch. So it's good and good for you. Highly recommended for fans of bizarre humor and really for anyone who likes to laugh."
4,Fooptastic!,"Upon reading the first paragraph I had no idea what to expect from Foop. And then again, whilst approaching the middle of the book, I STILL didn't know what to expect. I laughed out loud as I read FOOP, both wary and excited at where Genua's nutty sense of humor would take me. There is something in this book that touches a frequently neglected part of my sense of humor--following an illogical but entirely hilarious thread to its bitter end--and then somehow leaping back to the original story. It's hard to do--even harder to make compelling for an ADD American audience. This reader appreciated it.Foop is a delight! But do not look (as many are wont to do when reading fiction) to the plot for its unique intelligence. Foop's pleasure is found in the characters, their dialogue and the irrational, loony and hilarious voice of the narrator."
5,BUY THIS ALBUM...NOW!!!,"As with every album Lloyd Cole has ever put out - this is an OUTSTANDING addition to his collection. If you have never listened to his music then you owe it to yourself to purchase this album and work your way backwards. LYRICS: Raw. Feverish. Sometimes silly....always entertaining.My other half...finally...broke down and listened to ""Love Story"". He loves it. That's saying quite a bit ... being that he leans more towards Reverend Horton Heat & Supersuckers.Simply put...Lloyd ""rocks"" and he doesn't even mean to (""Tried to Rock"" from The Negatives)."
5,Excellent,"Great album and as for being a bar band, I saw him with Jill Sobule at the Mint down the street a few years ago and they were as engaging live as they are on the CD. As a plus, he's even better looking in person."
3,ok,"This book offers 6 sources of motivation. It is a short easy book to read with very large type. It is good for a very new manager but not mind-sharttering. It tells you things that make sense but that you may have learned in a early college phsycolgy class. It is nice to have it spelled out for you, so you don't forget. There will not be any Ah-ha's."
5,Baroque cello at its finest,"Don't miss Phoebe Carrai's fabulous solo Bach recording. This is a tremendous recording of incredible musicianship, tone color, depth and spirit. Performed on a cello in Baroque condition from c.1690, this musical outing is an inward experience. Aching tempi and spacious slow movements are contrasted by exciting bite and articulation. Some very unique and informed interpretations for those of us who are tired of another modern recording.Phoebe Carrai gained fame as a member of Musica Antiqua Koln and is currently a member of the Philharmonia Baroque. She has appeared with the Handel & Haydn Orchestra, Philharmonia Baroque, Arcadian Academy, Concert Royal, Bach Chamber Soloists, and Musica Angelica Baroque Orchestra as well as many other esteemed early music groups. She is a founding member of International Baroque Institute at the Longy School of Music in Cambridge, MA."
2,"Entertaining, but not Profound","A `Bravo!' chorus for Carrai echoes across the Internet. Carrai offers personal interpretations of Bach's cello suites which miss Bach's grace and depth. Carrai performs movements and phrases, sometimes too slow or fast - sometimes as lively dances, or dirges and often lacking dynamic range. Her interpretations seem unintegrated with the overall character of the suites.I prefer the interpretations by Fournier, Gendron and Tortellier, which are profound and deeply moving.The recorded sound is clear and resonant."
5,Japan should NEVER have been allowed to import products to the US,"Japan should never have been allowed to import their products into the US marketplace after WWII. This has caused nothing but havoc for American manufacturing, and it is a disgrace and betrayal to all those WWII veterans. If our government doesn't start treating its veterans better, they will have no one to fight their wars in the future. These soldiers give their lives to be betrayed over and over again after the war is over. It's completely unjust and disgusting!"
5,Boss Chaos Series Subwoofers,For the price they put out some great sound and I have them hooked up to a P5002 Rockford Fosgate amp they are pushed to the max and handle very well would recommend these sub's to anyone.
5,Beautiful......,This picture is stunning! Redoing our 15 year old daughters bedroom. She has loved horses since very small. I cant wait to get this framed and on her wall. My whole family inhaled when they all saw it. I would recommend this for any home or business. Cant go wrong.
4,thsi game is fun!,this game is very very very fun but the creat the charecter thingy is very confusing and how do we get more clothes for them
4,Great card,"This is a great card if you can get it for the right price. I have been very satisfied with the performance in 3d games like OBLIVION and the Dark Messiah of Might & Magic Demo. Video output is AWESOMe, video editing is awesome. Another great feature of this card is that you can dvi output to an HDTV as a monitor. I have a 32"" LCD tv hooked up to this thing and it works awesome in native windows environment, gaming, divx movies etc. Highly recommended.One downside is that the drivers/configuration screen load a little slower than NVIDIA stuff. But the level of control available is awesome. . . ."
5,"Great Card, Great Price","This card is great, it plays many games like OBLIVION and CALL OF DUTY 4, and its a really great card for the price. It can also overclock very well and get even faster than original speeds."
4,Finally! A Dissenting Voice on the Benefits of Free-Trade,"I knew next to nothing on the subject of free-trade before I read this book, but I must say I feel quite enlightened by the words and experiences or Mr. Buchanan.He makes an excellent historical case for economic nationalism - a practice embraced by Republicans throughout the 19th century. However, in terms of a modern defense of economic nationalism, I believe Buchanan relies too heavily on anecdotes and not enough on logical arguments.I happen to agree with Buchanan's conclusion that America and Americans must come first, without apology, in every economic decision our government makes. I only wish he had devoted more words to refuting specific free-trader arguments.Overall, an excellent book. Buchanan is a wonderful writer and a joy to read. I highly recommend the book to those who want to get familiar with the globalism/free-trade vs. protectionism/economic nationalism issue, particularly from a conservative populist perspective."
4,A reasoned defense of protective tariffs,"I enjoyed the book partly for the history lesson in the role of tariffs in U.S. growth. A good, but one-sided, defense of the need for protective tariffs. While I appreciate that Pat is trying to initiate a national debate on the efficacy of our current free market policy, I would have enjoyed some counter argument, if only to allay my concern that there might be easy refutation of some of his points. There was also no discussion of the value-added taxes in all developed countries that amount to a 15% tariff on U.S. products.But overall, it is an easy read, and provides valuable knowledge for anyone with an open mind on, and interest in, economic foreign policy."
5,A great book for American protectionists.,"Pat Buchanan takes on a subject many conservatives fear to even mention, the area of trade.Pat does an excellent job refuting many arguements used in favor of the free trade philosophy.The main point of the book is to show that free trade is un-american,and that high tariffs are in our best interests.He uses arguements from the founding fathers,as well as giving us a history of United States trade."
1,No Way!,No politician has the right to dicate who we can and can not trade with. Think what would happen if your state decided it was in it's best interest to close it's borders to trade with other U.S. states because it disrupted the communities.The law of competitive advantage is irrefutable and Pat Buchanan can never come to grips with this fact.
5,Well documented Must Read!,"Political debates from now on must include the contents of The Great Betrayal, else they will be meaningless. My AFSCME union should be backing Patrick Buchanan as well as all unions. For a long time Mr. Buchanan has spoken for the American working man and woman, while our union leaders have slavishly (pun intended) supported Democrat candidates lock-step without thinking, much less reading. When foreign countries want to dump their products in America they should pay the tariffs that were once the rule, and maybe, just maybe, we older Americans wont be taxed out of our homes now that we are retired. I can rave about this book for the length of a book! But I'll stop here!"
1,Politician's know best!,"There was an amazing machine in the port of San Diego. All loved this machine. Dump in grain, ore, timber and out popped good cars, tvs, and computers. They loved this machine until they discovered that Asian freighters fed it at night. Then they decided the machine was a threat to their jobs in this zero-sum-game, Malthusian world. The title should read something like this: How to force people to purchase products that are more costly. Anybody heard of the Smoot-Hawley Act? Give a politician the power to decide who you trade with? The politician will manage your trade with their omniscient knowledge of what is just the right measure of commerce with other regions of the globe. By artificially raising costs of foreign products your elected politician will give you job security. Its so easy. Make foreign products more costly! Thats the key to prosperity!"
1,An asset to Democrats,"The book is a lot of hot air, but it helped me make up my mind on politics: thanks to this book, I've decided to vote Democrat from now on."
1,Ignorance is indeed bliss.,"As the world shrinks a tiny band of self-serving demagogues struggles not only to keep existing barriers in place but to erect new ones. Blaming whatever ills we as a nation may face on those nameless yellow, brown and black hordes (not to mention the crafty frogs and Brits) is Buchanan's stock in trade. It is not a pretty sight. He is a bully and a fraud-this book proves it. His ignorance of basic economics is appalling. Interestingly, advance word has it his next book will deal in depth with his military service. Just kidding, given his propensity for closing his campaign speeches with a war-like 'ride to the sound of guns' or some such absurdity, it's obvious he has never served his country in any capacity beyond a that of a beltway insider."
5,Pretty pink,"I'm fair skinned, light haired gal. This color is bright and pretty pink. I like it. It is probably too light on any other skin tone than ivory or fair."
1,Disappointment,I received the watch todayhow disappointment the battery is deadand the face on the watch have a scratch on itso I will never shop online again at amazon.
3,chords,If you're buying this just to play the melody line or you know how to read chors this book is great. If you don't know how to read chords it does provide a guide in the back of the book but its hard to read that and play at the same time.
2,Different stories with a touch of interest,"I didn't mind this dvd at all, some of the short films were better than others. I wouldn't rush out and get another copy of this dvd but watching it filled in a bit of time."
4,great for boys that love assembling things and robots,This is an awsome book for kids that loves putting things together and taking things apart AND great for boys that love robots. My 3-yr old needs Mom & Dad's help to put the robot together but once it is together he can play with it for a while. The robot does not fall apart easily - my son has to make an effort to take it apart. We don't miss the fact that there is no story - we make up our own! The only complaints I have is that the binding of the book is weak and sometimes it is tough to get the pieces back into the book.
3,"I liked it, but not the best....","I liked putting it together, but the robot only says one sentence. He just says: ""Hello, you are my friend. Let's play."" Why can't he say something cool like: ""Blast off, my friend!"" or ""Let's pretend we're robots!"" I liked it, but it needs a little change."
2,Little Blue Robut,"The library where I work received this as a donation. For grins I thought I'd assemble the robot. It's not easy! Either the tabs fit very loosely into the slots (so the pieces fall apart) or the tabs don't line up easily because some already-assembled part is in the way.However I give it two stars, because the pieces are colorful, there are many shapes attached to the back, sides and head that can be turned, also a small cardboard heart and a key, and I think-- as a young child-- I would have gotten a kick out of it anyhow."
5,"NIce design, works well","BIG so you can see it from inside the house. Clear display, nice clean design. I haven't checked the accuracy but if it is off my a little, its no problem."
1,Poor Quality,"The thermometer tube was mounted turned slightly to the left, so you can't see the magnified part unless you look at it at an angle."
1,Not fuctional,"Ordered item with some reservations based on other reviews. Received item on time and intact. The thermometer is very large and at first glance appears to work fine. However, on closer examination I found I could only see the mercury reading from an awkward left angle. Other persons who posted reviews claimed to be able to lookout onto their porch and read the thermometer. The only thing I can figure is they must be employed by the company and be paid to write their review or must be using binoculars. I would definitely recommend you not waste your money on this item."
2,Would not recommend it,"It is large, but not easy to read unless you are at the perfect angle.if you are slightly to the left or right you can't see the red ""mercury"", also it comes with 1 small screw that won't hold in any windy conditions, plus it mounts flush so you can't angle it so you can read. I drill holes in it and made my own mounts so I could turn it to the right angle and it won't blow away on a windy day"
1,Voodoo Suite Review,"When I was young, I heard the Voodoo Suite and I was memerized. Now, 40 years later, it sounds like an amatuer mambo band playing stupid music. I believe this Voodoo Suite is NOT the original Perez Parado composition although it purports to be. My taste in music has not changed over all these years.Ivan Newman"
3,Inside American Motors automobile production,"Shay's book ""What Happens in a Car Factory"" is a 1960's ""picture window"" into automobile manufacturing at American Motors. Although unpaginated and with no table of contents nor index, this book is a rare look at how the popular Javelin goes through the manufacturing process. It was produced primarily for the school library market with black and white photos and simple text. On the fourth page of text Richard ""Dick"" Teague is shown. Page five shows Norbert C. Ostrowski working on a sketch and on page six you can see Bill St. Clair working on a clay model in the foreground. Unfortunately most of the people pictured, who made their mark on automotive history, have their names unknown. If you want to read more about Javelin design, another great picture history is C.L. Zinn's ""Javelin Photo Archive""Javelin Photo Archive From Concept to Reality."
2,No so good,The plastic is a little foggy so it's kinda hard to see through. I use this thing more to collect paper clips that I do anything else.
4,Not Your Average Prophecy Book,"This prophecy book is more meaty than the average dry toast type of which there are too many. Staffed by a variety of authors, all of them are politically incorrect by liberal standards which makes the volume even more edgy. The information is ""in your face"" style without trying--it is just the tenor of the volume. One might say it has """"shock effect"" without being melodramatic. All of the essays are serious wake-up calls to a sleeping Churchianity. All of them scream ""wake up for the night is coming."" This book should only be read by the serious Bible-reading believer. It may cause insomnia to others."
4,"Good, but not the best.","These are absorbant diapers and they hold up to the regular abuse of washing over and over again. They need to be washed several times before they are soft. I do need to mention that if you choose to cloth diaper your baby, you might want to just use velcro covers first since the weave is very tight on this diaper. I used pins, at first, and got frustrated, because they wouldn't go through the diaper. After a few washings, the weave loosened a bit and I was able to pin them more easily."
4,READ THIS,FYI The current stock photo/picture that Amazon has here with this item has a blue stitching and the word gerber printed in blue. This is not what you will receive in the mail. I called Gerber and they told me that have discontinued that exact diaper. What they do send out is basically the same. Wash it first and you will find it softens up and absorbs just as well as the past diaper did it just looks slightly different. Target nor Amazon has changed their pictures of this item since Gerber's changes occurred in Feb 08.
3,Not as good as they used to be....,"Definitely disappointed in these. I have some from 10 years ago that still had the blue stitching, and they washed up soft and nice every time. After four boys, I am still using them on caboose baby #5, but needed more to replace ones that were worn out. The new ones pill up after the first wash, and continue to pill. They are scratchy from this. Otherwise they are softening up as far as the fabric goes, but with the little fuzz balls there they are scratchy anyway. And they are smaller than they used to be...still better than the regular birdseye cloth diapers Gerber sells though. Shame on them for using sub-standard fabrics (probably just to save money) I paid more for these instead of buying the cheaper ones and I expected them to be nicer...Sign of the times I guess:("
1,Best diaper you can buy in a store,"I started using these for cloth diapering with my first child. They hold plenty and have held up pretty well. the ones I havn't bleeched are still going strong after 6 years! These aren't as great as Chinese Prefolds but then again they are a little bit cheaper, trimmer and you can get them when you need them rather than having to wait a week for them to arrive in the mail. these are the best diapers sold in stores."
3,plug a problem,Like the idea and the digital radio is a nice touch. My biggest problem is the plug. When the unit is plugged into a wall outlet the top of the unit covers part of the outlet above. This makes it impossible to use a 3 prong device and nearly impossible to plug in a 2 prong device. So you are dedicating an entire outlet to this one device. Seems they should have figured that one out.
3,Battery Life? What battery life?,"Nice enough if on sale, but rather compromised overall:#1: On full multi-day charges, the battery pack dies after a mere 45-55 minutes of standalone radio play. Has wired-in 4xAAA NiMH battery pack, could be changed out for better NiMHs if a techie person wanted, but....#2: Rounded bottom means it has to lie flat on its back.#3: Plug design, again.#4: Switches a bit underbuilt/underdesigned.Positives:#1: Nice blue LCD display when plugged in (not if standalone). Like a nitelite.#2: Combo of digital/rotary tuning, is precise.#3: Sounds a bit thin but very clear/clean, pretty good reception.Bottomline: keeper if $5, return it if paid asking retail $. Try try again."
2,Nifty but kind of cheap quality,"Likely discontinued because I bought this on sale at Frys for only $4.99. It was worth that price.Like the other reviewer said it dominates the electrical receptacle. Even a four plugger becomes hard to use.Radio sounds very tinny, but works OK. It picks up the local AM stations. I have it on the wall in a workshop where the nicely lit digital clock comes in handy. One problem I noticed was that there is a loud hum when I played the radio while it was plugged in (nothing else active on the line). I got around this by clipping a thin ground wire to the outside antenna. This seemed to also boost AM reception."
1,Not what I had hoped for,I purchased the Eton Blackout Buddy primarily as an emergency flashlight when the electricity goes out and also as a backup flashlight. I found out that it has little to no illumination. I am very dissapointed. For me it turned out to be a waste of money because it not like buying something at a store where it is easy to take it back.
5,Just what we needed,We use these for mixing epoxy and finding them in bulk is sometimes difficult... this is great for our needs.
4,Xenophon delivers,"I have always admired Xenophon. As a high school student I was in awe at his courage and extraordinary life. He was one tough ""hombre."" A warrior, a thinker, and a practical man who also knew faming and the equestrian art, he was a student of Socrates; in this book he allows us to get an additional glimpse of Socrates besides the well known Platonic accounts. The Socratic virtues Xenophon highlights are self-control and purity of life. Anyone who is attracted to those virtues will find much inspiration in Xenophon's ""Conversations."" I did not enjoy very much ""The Dinner Party"": call me homophobic, but I was never impressed with the Greek fascination for handsome boys. I also found ""The Estate Manager"" a bit too technical as a sub-urban, middle-class man of the XXI century. All in all, the translators ensured a smooth reading of the texts, for which they should be commended."
5,Must Read,"A must read for all who are in the pursuit of virtue and character development. Classic principles of behavior, no longer popular in today's culture, are detailed in easy to understand language."
1,Bad movie,"Acting bad, editing bad, everything bad. How can a place that's been closed up for 60 years be clean? No reason to watch this movie. Don't waste your time."
1,Another bad rip off,"How many bad rip offs, and sequels can one movie produce? Typical B-Movie. Talentless actors, naked girls, cheesy storyline. The scariest part of this movie, is when theyre walking in and see a snake. The ending makes no sense whats so ever. It was as if they writer ran out of material. So he just pulled something out of his A*s. And if you had any doubt about it being a rip off of Paranormal Activity. They say the phrase ""Paranormal Activity"" ateast 5 times within the first 15mins. Look elsewhere. This movie is not even worth the price of shipping."
3,OUCH!,"So they hurt worse than the needle probably will be. I mean, I got them like 2 days after I ordered them and tried them out before my needles got here and it hurts so bad. They have these little things inside of them that are like little needles sticking into your skin. It hurts terribly."
4,Here the next day,"These got in the way, I couldn't see what I was doing when I was piercing my belly button. I ended up setting this aside, but it gets 4 stars because, I ordered it and it was in my mailbox the next day! Thats the fastest shipping and processing ever."
5,VERY HAPPY,I am super satisfied with the product and the short ammount of time it took to recieve this product. It was awesome!
4,Speedy!,"REALLY fast delivery! Two days tops!Although the clamps are very sharp, and uncomfortable to use,I didn't order my product used, but it looks used from the packaging.(A plastic bag inside of a box)"
3,They're alright.,"I ordered these along with piercing needles and a ring from another company. These came in first and they're alright. They're nice as in quality, but they have small, I guess you could say, teeth on the inside of the rings that you grip the area you're wanting pierced. I bought these to pierce my septum with and it is a little painful to grab my nose with them. That's the reason they're only getting a 3 star rating from me. As for the quality of the metal, yes, they're very sturdy and lock very well. Only problem I have is the teeth on the circles on the end."
1,Broke first time I tried to use them,Mine came from Micro-Tools. Not the present seller on Amazon. They were not new.Some idiot ground the handles down. The part conecting the clamp to the pivot point was almost ground through. The first time I tried to use them they broke.
1,Very poor -- am returning immediately,"Very poorly and imprecisely made...sharp edges. These are absolutely worthless and as fast as I can get the return labels printed, I am returning these..."
2,disappointed,"Made in Pakistan, low quality stainless steel, lacks precision, low over all quality. If your going to be using these for body piercings, I recommend you spend the extra for German made. Might be OK for some electrical work like pulling diodes, thick wire. Not medical quality instrument."
2,not good for piercings,"This item may be good for some things, but it is not useful for piercing. I tried this with navel piercing, and the end of the jewelry got stuck, it was too big for the forceps hole. This caused pain and irritation for the new piercing."
4,Cute and sexy,Cute and sexy and I got these on sale too! Im very pleased. Photos describe the item well. Highly recommended.
4,"Not perfect, but nice","I bought this for my 13 yr old daughter. It is not as nice as shown on TV, but it did work. She has dark brown hair so it is pretty obvious that some colors will not show very well, but overall, I am pleased."
4,Good Product,"I'm a 13 year old girl that got this product, because I wanted highlights, but wasn't allowed. This is great for highlighting or lowlighting for a day, because it washes off as soon as you wash your hair. A disappointment was most of these colors suit brown hair, and mine is black. I wish Conair sold replacement cartridges color by color, and not include all these colors so you don't have the opporitunity to choose. Since a brownish color is best for black hair, only about half the colors suited my hair, and the rest of the cartridges will go to waste too. I don't think this would be a good product for blondes, because a lot of the cartridges are blonde, just to warn you so you don't waste $40. Also, there's no plug for it, so I don't know how long it'll last. Overall, it's an okay product, but not all that great."
2,Not quite as fun as expected,"We bought this for our granddaughter's 9th birthday gift, as she is very much into taking care of her hair. She saw this advertized on TV and thought it would be fun to temporarily streak her hair, playing with her friends and streaking each others hair. Not quite the case, though. Two reasons why she probably won't use the Conair Pro again: 1) the only ""fun"" color that came with the kit was blue. Other colors were shades of brown, golden brown, redish brown, etc. 2) it was painful /pulled their hair too much to make it a fun thing to want to do. Sorry we bought it. It was definitely not practical for young girls."
3,Just okay but not like the commercial,"If you have seen the commercial for this product the streaks or highlights look really dramatic. In real life they were much more subtle on my really dark brown hair. Some of the colors included showed up but others like the blonde didn't really work out too well. I think they should sell the kits by hair color so you only get what looks good on your hair color. I'd recommend this product for young girls or teens who can not get permanent color. If you want some quick natural temporary hightlights then you will also like it. A few tips this product seems to work best on straight hair that is short to medium length. Also when you first open a new color cartridge, take your fingernail and scrape a little of the color first, this will help transfer the color better onto the brush and hair. It's relatively easy to use and not messy at all so have fun."
2,Not great for dark hair,"I bought this for my 12 yr old daughter who wanted highlights in her dark brown hair. I settled for this because we wanted something temporary. We tried a few shades of bronze/gold tones and they barely showed up, looked more like sparkles than highlights. The blue showed a bit better, but we weren't up for a radical color! Maybe it works good on light hair, I don't know. But it didn't work well on dark hair."
4,"Yay, covers the gray!!!!",I'm having fun with this product. It's always available....not having to heat up or anything. Having about 70% gray it covers quite well although I use it for highlights rather than streaks or stripes. Never seeing the television ad for it I didn't have expectations.It took me awhile getting the knack of it....the slower you pull it through the better color you get.Great price for appliance and I also got a refill.mscoquina
2,Not what you expect,Sounds better than it is. My 10yr old daughter and I gave up trying to use it. Doesn't color very easily. overpriced.
4,wish it had a power cord,"okay. this does work. my three daughters loved it. it worked better on thinner hair. one of my daughters has thick, curly hair and dark too. the color just wouldn't show up as vibrant as on my other daughters. also, it runs on batteries. not sure how long they will last but i wish it had a power cord. the color cartridges that come with it come with limited selection. my daughters wanted funky colors like purple and green but only included one red and one blue among other colors that are for highlighting brown hair. the brushes are easy to clean. overall a good product and would recommend."
3,Gets tangled in hair.,"I bought this for my nice and she has straight dark brown hair. It still got tangled even doing small sections on the top layer of hair. Must use on dark hair or the color doesn't show up well. Leaves the hair gunky till it drys, takes 2 good washings for color to rinse out of hair. Plus it doesn't get your roots at all, there's atleast an inch of the color missing. Over all it was pretty neat to use but I will not buy her refills."
2,Not as easy as implied!,"I bought two of these last x-mas for my younger sisters (they are 12 and 14) and both of them got frustrated with them. My one sis got it to work but couldnt get all the color, it would only do part of her hair and she complained not enough color choices came with it for a teen, too many ""normal"" colors. My other sis managed to get her hair tangled and said it hurt, and never got it to work right. If you are willing to do it for them, this is a good item, and mostly when it ""doesnt work"" is because it is too complicated to do by yourself."
2,Not that great,We could not get the color to show very well. Some worked better than others. I would not recommed this product.
1,Conair Dying Kit,"I don't want to be picky, but this was the worst thing I have ever bought.First, I saw it on Amazon, and I read a lot of good reviews on it, so I bought it. I followed all the directions. Only a little teansy, shimmer of the color was in my hair.Totally crappyDo not buy!"
3,Not good at all,I got this toy for chistmas i `liked it but the color always faded away. When I put the blue in it faded as soon as I took the tool away from my hair. Later on I got REAL hilights and I'm only 10 years old!!!!
3,Works Fine,"The cord works fine and the 15 foot length is a lot better than my 10 foot one. My only problem with this cord is the sync part that goes into the camera fits loosely and not as tight as my 10' one. It periodically pops out while I'm using it. I've also even tried tying the cord around my camera strap to lessen the pull on it, but it only helps slightly."
4,Listening guides were missing from the set.,"The lessons on the tapes are very good, easy to follow and comprehensive. With repetition I should be able to speak French reasonably well when I get to France. I am very pleased with this product but am unhappy that the Listening Guides were not included. I like this method of learning! Merci beaucoup!"
2,Sizing a problem,"Sizing and comfort are a problem. Manufacturers suggested size for me is a medium. Seat and front fit OK, but there is bothersome material baggage at the bottom. Next size smaller is too small. Front seam in Pouch uncomfortable and should be eliminated. If the Manufacturer offered indvidual waist sizing some of the problems might be eliminated. Calvin Klein Basic Three Pack Brief is more comfortable and better value."
4,Incredibly short,"The sole reason why I gave this game four stars is due its length. Although a three CDs game, it does not live up to that. The first CD contains two areas to explore, and being three CDs long, I at first thought each CD contained two areas. Unfortunately, the second and third CDs include one area each.But don't let this disappoint you; Rion's house and the Hotel are more than enough to play this game. Really, that hotel was something creepy; knowing that the guests are dying one by one (and even creepier, knowing how they died) builds up enough atmosphere.Another point. The reviewer from Boston, Mass. had to read the instruction manual before playing. You need to take your pills in order to avoid that kind of events, not that Crave did that intentionally."
1,WORST GAME EVER,"This game is horrible. It has terrible play control and a poor story line. If you buy it you WILL be disapointed. The play control is the worst I have ever seen for a game. You have lame powers and no real attack except for your lame powers. It has good graphics, but thats it. over all this is the WORST GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED."
3,The Complicated world of the 17th Century Atlantic World,"The text is a thoroughly researched body of work, yet not for the faint of heart to read. The text is so well researched that the reader occasionally loses understanding if not interest in what the author is writing about. I'm curious why all of the family names of people who sailed to the colonies was so important to include in the text? This text is written for historians and is not a light read."
1,Don't Buy,This was sold as citrus flavored and it is not. It burns and is awful. It went down the drain.
1,Terrible,"I accidentally grabbed the original flavor of Listerine, which was a mistake. The Listerine products are great and I use the other flavors, cool mint and freshburst daily. However, this was an exception. It tastes kind of like strong bitter cough drops and stings a lot when gargled. My kids couldn't even handle a little bit. Listerine is great but don't buy this flavor."
3,They sent the wrong bottle,"I ordered two bottles of citrus listerine. I got two bottles of original and when I checked to return it, it says I can't because they violate the flammable liquid policy. So now I'm stuck with two bottles of awful tasting original. Not a knock on listerine just the wrong delivery and no return option. Price was better than grocery store but now I need to get the right one."
5,Awesome stuff! Body feels like it will fall awaprt if I don't have it!,"These vitamins were recommended by my naturopathic doctor about five years ago and they have become a very important daily routine! If I do not have these vitamins, my teeth start hurting and my eyes tend to ache towards the end of the day after missing a day or two. It's great to have these available on Amazon and I highly recommend this as a daily supplement. I do wish they had them on auto ship because we go through a bottle once a month."
4,Antidote To Myth,"This book mines the seam between cosmology and faith and develops a thesis that we should have faith in what's demonstrably real. Much simplified, when our existence is considered relative to other size scales, cosmology shows that we occupy a special place in the Universe and thus hold a special responsibility to ourselves to act not on mythic belief but in accord with proven reality. As I read this book, I kept wondering whether it was conceived as an antidote to those who seemingly believe that the Earth is theirs to trash (politically or otherwise) since in a merely mythical way, the end is nigh. I'm not sure it accomplishes that worthy goal, but it was a very interesting, accessible read nonetheless and quite enjoyable. The older I get, the more time I spend wondering about matters of science and religion. Primack and Abrams have created some wonderful metaphors to illustrate that logic and faith are not mutually exclusive."
4,"Good, though a bit disappointing.","This is very informative and interesting. It's description of modern cosmological knowledge is well written, informative yet comprehensible to the non-scientist reader. Also, the goal it explicitly sets is a good one, and the authors reasons for setting it are explained well, if not thoroughly. The one flaw is that the goal is not achieved within the book. Perhaps the authors only intended to point readers toward the vision, so that a broader consensus or range of opinion might be achieved, but I personally would have preferred an offering of something more complete and explicit. This is a book I wish everyone would read. We (meaning mankind) are entering a new age of civilization, and we need to begin thinking along entirely new lines. This book is a good beginning toward that end."
4,Complicated But Informative Book On The Universe,This is a very informative book. It talks about the history of what humans used to believe about the universe and the most recent discoveries of our day. It can get complicated and at times tedious to read but I would suggest it to anyone interested in the universe's workings and in science.
2,It's Just Different.,I took the couples class at UCSC. And boy was it a little weird and interesting... luckily their book was slightly less weird. It's def a different read with many mini history lessons on the cosmos.
5,View from the center of the universe,This publication is meant for lay people and scientists. It educates and enlightens.Science is at the root of cosmology but it turns out that Mythology isas well simply because some truths are so large and mysterious that they cannot bedescribed in purely scientific terms. Metaphorical language must be employed to wrap our minds around the concepts of the beginnings of the universe and how wehave become the human race that we know today.This book is written in terms that most of us understand. This awesome task iscarried out by an intelligent couple that is made up of a lawyer and a scientist.You will thank them for their awe inspiring work and feel that at last you knowwhere you came from.Joe Santiago MD
5,What a ways to go!,"The authors have done their research well. They've woven the past, present, and future into a more understandable whole, for we are all connected, not just humans, but also the plant and animal world. Everything we do affects everyone and every thing. May we consider that as we live our lives. Great job!"
3,2/3 OK,"The fist two parts of this book are excellent and show some good scientific research. The 3rd part, however, delves into conjecture and pure mysticisms and has llittle scietific relationship to the other two. I was surprised that the 3rd part was even included in this book and I'd recommend that readers just simply skip it."
5,Wonderful book combining science and metaphysics,"If you love books about the cosmos and our place in it then read this book. I absolutely loved its scientific rigour, its vision and humanism. I have read many books in the past that fill bookshops science shelves and I would put this at number one. Joel Primack is a professor of Physics in California and Nancy Abrams, his wife, is a lawyer and science and history scholar.Their book is truly inspiring."
5,The View from the Center of the Universe,I ordered three copies of this book and they all arrived in excellent condition and pleasingly discounted.
4,Robert Merrill,"This is the first volume in a series of the earliest commercial recordings by Robert Merrill. Some of the material is trite, but the voice - the instrument itself - is, of course magnificent. Merrill had a 40+ year career, and retired when he was still in fine vocal shape.These early recordings show the youthful freshness in his voice, in excellent quality due to Preiser's superb restorations. Preiser, without exception, has ALWAYS done a masterful job restoring 78's. No gimmickry -just good clean sound. As it should be. Any restorations on the Preiser label are worth obtaining. They totally respect their subjects."
1,Nice item if it fit.,"Add states Fits 1-7/8"", 2"" and 2-5/16"" hitch balls. Tag on ball cover states that it only fits 1-7/8"" and 2"" hitch balls. Try as I may I couldn't on a 2-5/16 hitch ball. Add lied."
4,For those looking for burp cloths...,"I bought these to use as burp cloths for our son. We have some pricier burp cloths, but I wanted an inexpensive set to have around the house. They do shrink quite a bit after the first wash and they are not very soft, but they are absorbent. I would recommend them for anyone looking for quick and cheap burp cloths."
1,Not a good diaper!,"As an environmentalist, I wanted to use cloth diapers. I bought 3 packs of these diapers which started unraveling, getting holes in the middle, or both when my baby was 6 weeks old. One third of these diapers are too damaged to use, and I keep finding more damaged diapers. Your discription said something about a sponge insert for more absorbancy, but none of the packs that I bought at the Newpark Mall Target in Newark, CA had sponge inserts. Nor did that Target sell the inserts separately. This product isn't durable enough or absobant enough to be used as a diaper."
4,Great for burp cloths!,"These diapers make great burp cloths. They are large enough to cover a lot of your shoulder, plus they are nice and soft. I always keep one or two handy at all times to clean up."
5,Love them!!!,"My mom bought these for me to use as burp cloths. They are wonderful! They fit perfectly on a shoulder, are very absorbent and they launder well. Highly recommended!"
5,The BEST burp cloths ever!,These are by far the BEST burp cloths around. I got several different kinds at my baby shower. I ordered these after reading the reviews because the ones I received at the shower were paper thin. These are fabulous. I buy them for every baby shower I go to now. The middle panel is very thick and helps with a newborn that spits up a lot and those breastfeeding blunders that happen to a new mom. I highly recommend them. They are worth the money.
3,absorbency,"Don't buy these if your looking for a pre-fold that will hold all of your childs waste in,and if you have a heavy wetter don't weven think about it without a doublerDiaper Doubler - Absorbency Booster - 2 Piece Set(these are nice) they are no wear near as absorbent as chinese prefolds, these make great claning clothgs and burp rags though. that's about all they are good for please spend the extra money on diaper service quality prefolds it will be worth it in the end."
3,Gerber Prefolds,"I bought these as burp cloths for my two boys.As burp cloths they are great - nothing fancy, just good at absorbing the spit up. The fancy burp cloths are usually too flimsy (won't lay flat on your shoulder) and too thin to be helpful. These stay in place without having to touch/fix it.I have tried them for cloth diapering but it seems they don't hold very well and leak more than the other diaper inserts I've used. I usually don't cloth diaper so I can't say too much on this - this is just from the few times I have used it."
2,nota as good as I thought,"I ordered these thinking they were like the cloth diaper spit cloths my mom used when I was a kid, but they are thinner and the fabric mekes me itch and get a rash on my hands...my daughter gets a rash on her face, so I dont think she likes em either. I k"
1,worthless for diapering,"These diapers are lousy for diapering. The moisture wicks from end to end, and they absorb very little. The Gerber diaper service quality flatweave are better, while the chinese prefolds bought online are better still. They do make decent burp cloths, and are fine for washing cars."
1,"Cheap, thin and not worth the money","I was excpecting great quality from the Gerbers prefolds I received a couple of weeks ago. I was very disappointed. They were so thin and cheaply sewn that I could not use them individually for my son. I had to sew two of them together to even make them thick enough to absorb a small amount of liquid. After one time through the wash, the edges of the cloths were fraying. These are not made to last and I would not purchase them again."
2,Poor Diaper/ Good Burp cloth,"These should not be called cloth diapers. They are horrible for cloth diapering, but work well as burp cloths or just as general rags."
2,A disapointment in cloth diapering,"My mom used Gerber cloth diapers on me and my 3 siblings when we were growing up and I believe the quality of the ones made back then must have been better than what I've got today. I bought a pack of 12 and 2 of them ripped at the seams during their first wash. They don't seem to be very absorbent at all - they wick through my son's diaper covers and clothes. They do make good burp rags, though. I bought some of the chinese prefolds and I'm hoping to have better luck with them."
2,Useless for anything wet!,"I got these for my baby shower. I had read the reviews on these beforehand and was not impressed from the beginning, but I figured that for free they were worth a shot. INCORRECT! Thankfully, my daughter is too small for ANY cloth diapers so far, because if I had used these I would have to change her every 5 minutes (including her clothes). I used them as a pad to keep under her head in the crib so I wouldn't have to change the sheet every time she spit up, and I still do because it takes about 10 minutes to soak through the padded part, and 10 milliseconds to soak through the outer part (which is see-through because it is so thin). However, I did give them two stars instead of one because I feel that they would probably make great dust rags. Just keep them away from anything wet!"
5,"Can't speak for diapering, but a MUST for burp cloths!","The cute, fancy little burp cloths on the market are no match for babies that spit up like mine do. These wash well, are absorbent, USUALLY cover enough of the shoulder/arm to prevent clothing from becoming a mess, and are very soft. We could not make it without these!"
1,not absorbent,my newborn soaks these in a single shot. In a couple of months they'll be useless except for furniture dusting duty.
1,Not for cloth diapering!,"As a new mom, I decided to cloth diaper...which I still avidly do. However, not with these diapers. If you enjoy diapers that DO NOT absorb and LEAK...then these are the diapers for you. Honestly, these are a terrible quality. I do not recommend them for cloth diapering. I wouldn't even recommend them as burp cloths. They are just plain lousy diapers in my opinion."
3,Wrong one.,"I bought these thinking they were the cloth diaper inserts. These are the actual cloth diapers, they are 20 inches long! I Think i might be able to to squeeze them into a insert we will see."
3,warship gunner 2,"there is not many naval simulators on ps2.that being said this one is so-so.you are the commanding officer of a warship.there is very little realism as far as ship combat.but if you want pure run and gun this is for you.bottom line:very little in mission diversity,or enemy strengh(one vs many)graphics are decent.overall C+.replay very low."
5,Tall Jazz is amazing!,"Simply put, Tall Jazz is amazing! This disc truly captures the essence of Christmas. Tall Jazz and Rebecca Kilgore's unique approach to holiday standards makes for a toe tapping, hum along experience that resonates throughout the season."
4,A good basic book on Eishin-Ryu Iaido drills.,"Though I really enjoyed this book, without a basic knowledge of Iaido, one could easily find the drawings too complex to follow. The book is of value more to a student of Iaido who is taking lessons from a sword master. This text when used in combination with hands-on training would be the best combination.In conclusion, this is a book for anyone interested in basic Japanese Swordsmanship.Rating: 4 Stars. Joseph J. Truncale (Author: Wakizashi-Jutsu Manual)."
4,"A good instructional book, but not definitive","This book makes no claims to be the be-all-end-all of iaido instruction - it flat-out states that you should go get a sensei. That said, Suino does a good job of providing a good reference for those who know what they're doing and a good starting point for those who don't.I like how each kata's rationale is explained and how each move is detailed. The opening sections, like how to bow and the parts of the sword, are good introductions for beginners. My main problem with the book was that some moves are still ambiguous, despite there being pictures and text explanations. Close-ups on what certain body parts or doing or a constant perspective (each diagram, with rare exception, is seen from the figure's right side, even if he turns, leaving the reader confused as to what direction they should be facing).That aside, the book is a good reference, and practitioners of iaido should seriously consider buying it."
4,Very Good!,"A clear book with all drills and other complementary stuff of Eishin-Ryu Iaido.I am not an expert in Iaido but this book seems to be very clear and complete, evenwhen the numbers of the descriptions for some pictures have some minor mistakes respect to the numbers of the picures themselves (you can correct them by hand)Mr Suino seems to be an excellent martial artist wit a very serious approach to the discipline"
3,Hard to follow the moves,"The book is a good introduction to the art of Iaido, but the diagrams are difficult to follow and the hand motions could be better explained. Iaido is difficult to follow without a sensei - I could understand some of this stuff because I've had lessons...but for a new beginner without guidance, I wouldn't recommend this book."
3,"Solid guide for new iaidoka, but terrible illustrations.","If you are new to iaido and need a reference guide for when you are away from the dojo, this book is very useful. It explains each kata step by step with meticulous detail, and goes over the basics such as how to grip the sword, how to put on the clothing, and so forth.As long as you have an understanding of each kata, going back to practice with the guidance of this book will be straightforward. However, the pictures are almost worthless. They are only good for giving you an overview of how the kata proceeds. It's impossible to tell how the feet are positioned, what the hands are doing, and even which way the sword is supposed to be facing when in the saya. Photographs would have been far better."
3,"A good beginner's guide, useless to the experienced","This book offers a wonderful introduction to the martial artist who has been exposed to limited swordplay in a jujitsu or karate class and wants a way to continue his or her learning seperatly. Unfortunately it offers no kata or even original thoughts on basic kenjutsu or iai. Good illustrations and explanations of the moves and forms entailed, but overall not worth the price to the more experienced swordsman."
4,"Light, compact two season sleeping bag","I purchased the Merlin 3 5 years ago and use it for the cool seasons, 40 degrees to 80 degrees. The synthetic material make it too warm for summer and the lightweight make it too light for winter. However, this is the most compact, reasonably priced lightweight mummy bag I have found. It dries well, packs quickly and is highly durable. The stuff sack it came well is also a water proof compression bag.Several minor complaints: (1) the zipper will stick if you are not conscientious; (2) the bag is rated to 32 degrees Fahrenheit but is not comfortable without being supplemented below 40 degrees; and, (3) while not narrow, the bag is not designed for broad shouldered people.These aside, I highly recommend the Merlin 3 for temperate hikes and frequent enjoyment as I have on countless long and short forays into the great wild."
5,A significant defense in the Reformed tradition,"Jordan defends the traditional reading of the creation account with a command of biblical theology rarely encountered. But Jordan does more. He precisely and convincingly identifies exegetical errors in opposing positions. Moreover, he reveals the subtle influences of gnosticism and false assumptions of ""science"" which are behind modern interpretations. This is an outstanding contribution.--Rev.James Bordwine, Th.D. I highly recommend this book!"
1,Makes a Nice Paper weight....,"Not really a very good book. I've read it 2x now, and it's even worse the second time than the first. There are other books you can buy, if you want to explore the earlier chapters of Genesis."
1,Yet Another Fundamentalist Assault,"This book is an excellent guide to self discovery; A tool for attaining deeper knowledge of the self. Let's say, for instance that you thought the book was relevant and scholarly, well then it is fairly obvious that you need to go to college, or in some way educate yourself."
2,Wake me when it's over.,"I bought this game with no expectations and, like many people, I was intrigued by the Rob Zombie soundtrack. The game was dark, gothic and errie but was as complex as childrens puppet show. You have very little choices and spend the entire time being lead like cattle into room after unchallenging room where you brutally slash creatures. Walking was awkward and not sensitive. I would walk into items and ""POOF"" I would just pop up on top of them with out jumping. In short, the game lured me in because of its dark nature and then bored me to tears. Medievil 1 & II were way better even though they were not as gross. I would also like to agree with another reviewer in saying that the contrast of this game is so dark that I had a hard time seeing things. It almost seems like the designers of this game escaped makeing the game detailed by just making most everything black. Wake me when it is over. Rent before you consider buying this game."
5,Great activity warm up for kids of all ages!!,I teach K-6 PE and love this as a warm up. Kids are VERY active and it has a great variety of activities.
2,Not happy,"When the package arrived it contained only a broken ceramic bowl, a pot of dirt, bag of rocks, and two pieces of wire mesh. No tools, book nor plant was included. I called regarding the broken bowl and was told they will replace it. But will they send the remaining items?"
1,Only for VERY infrequent use,I got this pump for a gift and was very excited that I wouldn't have to buy one. I'm now (3 months later) buying a better pump. This pump hurts and takes FOREVER. It burnt out after two months of infrequent use. You save money in the short term but not the long run. There's a 6 month guarantee but you have to pay for shipping n doubt really get money back. Probably only get another pump that's going to break after your warrantee is up.
2,waste of time,"It took forever to express milk. And it was so loud that if you tried expressing while the baby was sleeping forget it. Also, forget about watching TV while your expressing milk because you can't hear it. Too many parts to buy. My original pump did not work. No Suction. Second pump worked but when you have an infant who has all day to pump."
1,returning this pump,"This pump is a waste of money. I admit it, the price is attractive (there doesn't seem to be a middle of the road for these things). However, the pump just doesn't work well. It takes forever and after 15 minutes, the motor seems to die out. Look for a better alternative."
1,Medela used to be the best,"I am soooo disappointed. I bought this pump 5 years ago with my first child and it was wonderful. I unfortunately couldn't find it for my second since we moved a couple times since so I bought another one for my second child. I immediately could tell it was made cheaper!! The pump doesn't have good suction, it leaks, it squirts milk, the motor starts to ""struggle"" after about a couple of minutes, and gets louder and louder. It's horrible. I wrote to Medela and they basically blew me off. Don't buy this pump..."
1,Not worth the money,My wife and I purchased purchased the Medela single deluxe pump for home use. Our main complaint is that it is extremely noisy - no watching TV or talking while you pump! You really don't get much for the...price tag. We ended up buying the high-end Pump In Style model...which is a much better product and has a completely different suction mechanism that is fairly silent. Our advice is to spend the extra [money] for the Pump In Style model.
1,dont buy it!,"Dont buy it! I used it for 2 weeks and it worked just fine -- was able to get 4 oz within 7 minutes, then all of the sudden, it stopped working. It would still pull at my nipple but nothing would come out -- I would constantly have to readjust the sheild to get more. I called customer service and they said that it was a lactation issue but with another pump I have no problems. DONT GET IT! Buy a hands-free one so that you can walk around the house - you dont want to be tied down to the machine."
5,LOVE IT!!!,"I absolutely love this pump. Unlike the other reviews I do not find it to be loud. Maybe this is because I have used other pumps such as the Evenflow (awful do not buy), which is pretty loud. I have recommended it to all my friends and plan to go on doing so. I have been back to work for 2 weeks now and I have been pumping 3 times a day. It has yet to disappoint me. For those of you that need a good Breast Pump this one is for you. Although I do not use the battery option so I do not know how well it works off batteries. Good Luck Breastfeeding it is the best thing for baby :-)"
3,good for occasional use only,"I had premature twins I was pumping for in NICU and this was more in my budget. I didn't expect to have to use it after they came home, but its looking like they aren't going to get the hang of breast feeding. I don't mind the noise and the motor is still working after two months of using it 6-8 times a day, but it seems I am getting a lot less milk with it now than in the beginning, so maybe the motor is getting weaker. I went and bought an Isis and I use both at the same time, and I get much more milk much faster with the Isis. If I had it to do again I'd have bought the Pump in Style. This pump really is for occasional use only. And even for that, I'd buy the Isis. Its cheaper, will last longer, is quiet and does just as good a job if not better. Its only downfall is more pieces to figure out and wash."
5,The answer to my prayers!,"This pump is a godsend! I had been using a horrible Evenflo pump (don't waste your money on one!), and knew that there had to be something better! I finally broke down and spent the money on this Medela pump, and am SO happy with it! The milk lets down almost immediately, and I can fill a bottle in under 10 minutes! With my old pump it would take 20 minutes to get an ounce! The Medela pump is probably not the best choice for working moms, but then again - Medela itself does not reccomend it for those who pump more than occasionally. Some have mentioned that it is noisy, but I find it no louder than the Evenflo pump I was using. All in all, I am delighted with this product!"
3,So far so good,"Although I've been using it for less than a week, I do use it 3 times per day at work. I have the Pump in Style breastpump, but its a bit heavy to carry with all the other things I carry to work (including a laptop) it was just too big. Also, my office is completely opened - everything has windows - including the private offices (if you can call them private) as well as the conference rooms. The only place I can really pump is in the restroom. And although the restroom has outlets, I'm not big on standing out in the open with women walking in and out and anyone being able to look in and see me in the mirror with my breast hanging out. So basically this works well for my situation, so far, because I can hang out in one of the stalls and pump away. The only complaint I really have is that it is pretty noisy and I'm sure it will eat through batteries. I will probably see about investing in some rechargeable batteries and see if that works for me."
4,Very Good Breast Pump,"I only used this pump for the first month as I did not produced much milk but it was great when I used it. As a first time mom, I found it very comfortable and easy to use. I also sterilized the pieces after a day of use and each piece came out fine. I did find that I had to bend forward to get maximum output but it was not uncomfortable. If you plan to do a lot of pumping then getting the double pump might be worth the extra money as it is quite time consuming with only one pump. Overall, an efficient pump, no complaints."
1,Warning,"I bought this pump from BabiesRus in July and was floored at how loudit was -- it sounded not just like a wheedwhacker, but like a brokenone at that! Made let-down virtually impossible. I couldn't imagine itwas supposed to be that way, so went back to the store. As you mayknow, they normally don't return pumps once opened, but the second themanager saw what I'd bought, he said, (and I quote almost verbatim.)""THAT one is the only one we'll take back. There's a problem withthe motor and the valves. You're lucky it presented itself right away,as a lot of them are not only noisy but are wearing out right afterthe 90-day warranty is up."" I was lucky, but be warned! I made apoint to patronize another brand."
4,Is it the motor?,"I like this pump, but I must admit I haven't used any other. After a few weeks, the suction just stopped. I noticed that the little rubber gasket was warped, and it didn't hold the seal. The pump came with 2 replacement gaskets. I switched it out, and was back in business. I noticed some of the other reviewers had similar problems, but it was their motor. Check the gasket first! I've been using mine for 2 months now, once or twice per day. Yes, it's kinda noisy-- but again, I have nothing to compare it to.Also, the connection on the pump is the same size as Gerber bottles. I got an Avent bottle set for my shower, which has a wide mouth-- I can't pump directly into the Avent bottle. I have to pump into the Medela bottle that comes with the set, then pour the milk into the Avent bags for storage. A small inconvenience. Keep this in mind if you're registering for bottle starter sets."
4,Best when there is no socket,"I have to pump in the bathroom twice a day in the office, as all the conference rooms are with glass walls and doors. Since the bathroom has no socket for me to plug in, I am really glad that this pump can be used with 2 AA batteries. I have been using it for 3 months already, and thankfully, my baby is still exclusively breastfed.Though I find the pump is really noisy with the loud humming sound (so I guess my co-workers using the next cubicle will know what I am doing), and does not work as well by using batteries: with slightly weaker suction, and the power runs out really quickly, that's the best electric pump in the market that I can find. I would recommend it to my friends who want to express in the office with no private office room. Or if you plan to travel without the baby."
2,"Ok , but only for occassional use","Don't waste your money - spend more to get a better pump!!!This pump was great in the beginning, but recently it just gave out. I had my son in November and primarily nursed him until I came back to work in the beginning of March. I only used the pump upon occassion or to express some milk for his daily cereal feedings. The pump is small and compact and I thought it was great for portability. I've been using it about 3 times a day with the exception of the weekends and I've noticed that the suction just is not as good as it was when I first got it. I've also noticed that while pumping the milk will remain in the bottom of the barrel of the breast sheild, bubble up and leak out where the motor screws into it instead of going into the bottle. I've only been using this pump since November (it's now March) and it died on me today. I now have to go out and buy a new pump or rent one."
4,A pretty good pump,"I received this pump as a gift. I like it because it is electric. I got the manual attachment free from the hospital and it is very difficult to use even with the spring loading. For manual use I recommend the Avent Isis. However, there are times when I just feel like sitting down and not having to manually pump. This works great. It comes with storage containers and a nipple insert for smaller nipples. Plus it comes with some lanolin just incase you get sore nipples. It is a pretty good buy. It doesn't work any better than a manual, but it is more convenient since you don't have to work as hard. I wouldn't have bought it myself, but since it was given to me, I am glad to have it. :)"
1,VERY Disappointed,"I have a Medela double pump which I LOVE! But it is too big and bulky for travel, etc. So I invested in this pump. And I am VERY DISAPPOINTED in it. First, it is so loud that it is completely impossible to let down and it distracts the baby nursing on the other breast. Second, the suction is horrid, I could barely get any milk out and I know how much milk should be coming out because I pump with the double pump every morning. This was a complete waste of money and the only way you can spare yourself the disappoint is to read these reviews because there is no return!!!"
3,Not that bad,"Yes, motor is noisy but if you intend to use it in the privacy of your own home then it's ok. In fact the noise of the motor serves as &quot;white noise&quot; for my baby at times. It is very slow and it has taken me 6 weeks to get to the point where I can pump 4 ounces in about 15 minutes and that is when I am engorged. As for the pain, yes, it hurts but with time, it gets better as does breast feeding."
1,Waste of money,"I've been using a manual pump, and thought a electric pump would be easier and more convient. The suction is so low, even on maximum, that I needed to go back and use the manual pump afterwards. Never mind the noise. The kicker, you can't even return the product if you are not satisfied and if you call Medela they are no help...don't waste your money."
5,Convenient and Great Price,"I have been really happy with this pump. I use it for supplemental feedings and it is both quick and convenient being electric and battery operated for travel. I highly recommend it for Mom's who don't have to do heavy duty pumping. Also, the noise doesn't bother my baby at all, he likes anything that hums."
2,It Moos Like a Cow... Seriously,"I wasn't terribly comfortable with the idea of breastfeeding anyway, but felt pressured into at least pumping when my son practically chewed my nipples off and I couldn't continue. The noise this pump gives off is loud like the other moms have said, but for me the kicker is that the suction sounds like a cow mooing!After two weeks of producing maybe 4-5 ounces in 45 minutes every three hours and still coming up with blood-tinged milk, I gave up breast milk altogether and formula fed our son.Our second is due in 5 weeks and I still have this pump and want to try breastfeeding with a more open mind. I'm hoping that the mechanics of it all come more naturally this time because I'm not looking forward to using this pump again!"
2,didn't work...maybe its just me,This didn't work for me. I would have to nurse my daughter on one side and pump on the other to get like 1.5 ozs. for 25 minutes. That got more and more complicated the bigger she got. That wasn't worth my time. I don't work so I just breastfeed her all of the time and give the very occassional formula. Maybe it's just me though.
1,Useless and aggravating,"This was by far the biggest waste of money I spent when my baby was born. I was able to express more milk manually with my hand than this pump. It's loud and ineffecient. I tried everything to help it work. I would have my son nurse from one breast and use the pump on the other, and I think the pump discouraged that breast from letting down. In three months of attempting to use it I maybe got three ounces of milk total ever. I only bought it for the occasional pumping and never even got that from it. If I could give it zero stars I would."
3,This pump was too loud!,"This pump did it's job, but it was too loud. I used it for an entire year with my first child, but now that I am going to have a second child, I am purchasing the Madela pump in style double pump, which has excellent reviews. Thinking back on my old breast pumping days, it haunts me to think of how lound this single pump was. I can't take the noise this time. I had read the reviews before I bought this pump. Everyone said it was too loud, but I never could have imagined that it was really as loud as what people said. Well it is. Unless they have improved the model from 2002. If you value your time and hearing, then go with the dual pump that has great reviews and save your money."
3,Don't buy if you need to increase supply; fine for removing,This is not the right pump to buy if you are trying to increase supply. You'll need to rent a hospital pump for that. This pump is nicely designed and will work fine to relieve engorgement or simply to remove milk.
2,Marginally good pump,"Purchased this pump as alternative to an expensive pump. While I found it works well when you have not fed for a long period of time and are engorged, it did not work well for pumping in between feedings. Having rented a double pump (Medela) so that I could compare, I found that the suction on this pump does not stimulate let-down; additionally, the suction is so intense that it does not work as well for that mid-day pumping session and actually was a bit painful. I found that this pump would not pull one drop out yet the Medela double pump would. I would purchase this model only if I had very little use for a breast pump at all and was not planning on using it on a regular basis. I would spend the money on the more expensive model and not waste the money on this one."
5,Super easy to use.,"I was so unsure of what type of pump to buy. I wanted to try a smaller pump before I shelled out the big bucks for the ""shnazzy pump"" so I decided to try this model. I will tell you that I don't feel that I need to buy a more expensive pump. This pump works very quickly and is easy to use. It's loud, but who is really going to pump whenthey are sitting at their desks at work trying to get things done?? I highly recommend this model. It's saved me a ton of dough!!"
1,Buy the Medela Pumping In Style Instead,I purchased this pump after using the maual one for about one month. The suction action on the pump was not strong at all and I could get more milk in less time with the manual one. I was going back to work and the manual pum was still too slow to use during my break times so I broke down and purchased the Pump In Style version and it worked excellent. My pumping time was cut in half and i can express 2-6oz from each breast in 10-15min. If you will be breast feeding for a substantial mount of time I recommend the Pump In Style rather than the Single Deluxe Battery/Electric Breast Pump. None of the pumps are refundable or exchangeable so don't waste your time or more importantly your money with the Single Deluxe Pump.
4,Great pump,This is a great pump to use. I have tried many battery operated pumps and found this one to be the best. It is very easy to use and lightweight. This item is highly recommended
1,waste of money,I bought this as the reviews were good. I was planning to use it only once a day hoping electric would be better. But this is a total dissappointment. Poor performance. The only fact that I agree with the review is that it is very noisy.
2,Didn't last long,"Heed the bad reviews. I think the problem may be Medela's definition of ""occasional use."" I used this pump about once every other day or two for a month and a half--and apparently that is deemed more than occasional, because the pump yields very little now... about half of what it used to. So this is yet another review that leads to the same conclusion: I should have gotten a different pump."
2,Really Hurts...Doesn't get alot,"I bought this pump with my first son and used it sporatically. I found that (and even now with my second son) everytime I use it the suction seems too strong and it hurts. I think that this becomes a hindrance to let-down because I can never pump out more than 1 or 2 ounces total at a time. I know I have more milk because I still feel full but the pump doesn't get it. I have had lots of problems with breastfeeding my second, so far, and have developed cracked nipples and mastitis. I needed to use this pump to help stimulate production and found that the strong suction made it too painful to continue using it. I don't know if a manual would be more comfortable or not, but I don't think that the designers of this pump had COMFORT in mind when they made it. This one is going in the garage sale pile in my house."
3,good pump,i started using the avent manual pump until i received this one as a gift. in my first pumping i got twice the amount of milk in half the amount of time that i would have gotten with the manual pump. i was in shock. the only problem is that it uses batteries really fast so i would invest in some rechargeable batteries for it. would be nice if it came with a carrying case but that is minor. overall a really good pump and i would recommend it to anyone.
4,practical and convenient,"a small pump but enough for what I need, I use it frecuently with batteries when I'm away from home and no complaints about it.Very good and affordable, light weight, little noisy but I recommend it."
3,"it's alright, not magical, just alright","i got this pump for my sis so she could have a break from the hand pump. It did rest her hands but it's so loud! She has to turn the tv up in the room so everyone can still hear while she pumps. Also, according to my sis the suction isn't as good as with her purple Medela hand pump. It does have battery capability and a plug so it can be portable for when she pumps at work. So it does the job of relieving hand cramping from manual pumping, and it's easily portable but I would look for a quieter stronger pump next time."
2,Occasional use only!,"I bought this to use for pumping at work when I returned from maternity leave. I ignored the fact that it is rated as ""occasional use"" and used it twice a day every workday. After 3 weeks the pump was sounding like it was ready to die every time I turned it on. I was able to get a replacement from Medela via the warranty but after only one week that one is already sounding the same way. The pump works fine when it is working. But it definitely shouldn't be used more than once a week (or maybe just once a month!)! I am replacing it with a Medela Swing, hopefully it will work better for me! If you are intending to pump often, spend the money and buy a higher quality pump!"
1,Not a good buy!,"I purchased this produce and the device started to fail just a few months after the purchase. The device was used maybe a few times per month so it wasn't overused. I called Madela and I was able to get it working again through troubleshooting the problem. I used it a few times after that and then maybe 4 months later I needed to use it again and could not. I called Madela to trouble shoot and the woman told me that after the 1st troubleshoot call the motor started breaking down because of the method of troubleshooting so now that the warranty is up (6 months) all they could do was offer me a 20% discount from what they charge which would make the purchase price the same as buying it on Amazon.com. The person who initially did the troubleshooting should have told me about the motor so I could get another pump within my warranty. Now, I have to spend money on another pump. This product is unreliable and the company has terrible customer service. DO NOT BUY IT!"
5,"Easy, Comfortable, Durable!","I highly recommend the Medela Single Deluxe Breast Pump. I found it to be extremely comfortable and very easy to use/clean. I was having a really hard time breastfeeding my daughter and opted to try a breast pump... I cannot express (no pun intended!) what relief it was to be able to COMFORTABLY express breast milk! The item included a sample of lanolin (for nipple soreness), but I never experienced ANY pain or discomfort with this pump! I have heard people comment that it is noisy... but, I didn't think so."
4,Worked Great!!!,I have been using this pump for 8 mos now and still think it works great. I used the plug-in at home and the battery when I was at work or on the road. I got rechargeable batteries that helped a lot. If your battery is not charged the pumping is a little weak. I could get about 4 oz in 10-15 minutes. My only complaint is that it is a bit noisy.
3,Ok... but I replaced with a double pump.,"This pump is decent but wasn't enough for me. I am home with the baby so I didn't think I needed one of the larger double pumps since I am not working. However, I needed to pump to improve my supply in the begining and also while I was healing from a cracked nipple and the single pump just didn't cut it. I ended up purchasing the Medela Pump-in-Style and it works much better. Now I use the double pump to fill an evening bottle for my husband to feed to the baby. It would take twice as long with the single pump. I REALLY hate pumping so it is worth everything to get it done in half the time! I think this pump is only worth it if you will rarely need to pump or to use for just a few minutes before feeding the baby to relieve engorgement."
1,PESIMO!!,"Pense que era una muy buena compra ya que la marca es bien reconocida. El primer defecto que le note fue que era muy ruidoso, pero trate de ignorarlo confiando que iba a resultarme bueno por su marca. A las dos semanas de usarlo a la copa para el seno se le abrieron grietas en el plastico, haciendo dificil poder succionar bien. Luego que logre conseguir el repuesto de la pieza, me sucedio que tres semanas despues no se por cual razon, dejo de succionar con fuerza y a dura pena lograba sacarme en 15 minutos 1 y 1/2 onzas cuando normalmente me sacaba 4 onzas en 10 minutos. Siento que para el valor del producto $79.99 fue una terrible compra ya que termine comprandome uno nuevo de distinta marca. Espero tener mejor suerte pues mi bebe apenas tiene 5 semanas y me falta mucho tiempo por delante de usar este aparato."
3,Works ok but ...,It works and it is nice to have the battery so your not trapped in one location but I need something for both breast and something with a little more power for everyday use so I bought the deluxe pump made by them..
1,A Word to the Wise.....,".....make sure you are actually able to get your baby to nurse before you spend big money on this or any other nursing supplies. If you scan this stuff for your registry and people give it to you without a gift receipt (someday everyone will catch on), you will be stuck with it. The store won't take this stuff back."
2,Disappointed with this Medela product,"I had used the Avent Isis manual pump for my firstborn, but wanted an electric pump the second time around because I thought it would be faster with less effort. Unfortunately, compared to the Avent pump, it is painful and I am not impressed with the suction/release cycle no matter what the setting. It is also VERY noisy, and it takes just as long as with the manual pump. I had used the hospital grade Medela Lactina for 2 months after the birth of my preemie and it was just great. I can't say the same for this Medela pump -I'm sticking with my Avent ISIS. **The one advantage of the Medela is there are fewer parts to put together and wash than the Avent. I wish I had believed the reviews!"
1,Save Your Money!,"This breast pump terribly disappointed me. Although it is a one-sided pump (for one breast at a time), you have to hold it with both hands for it to sit tightly. Having a little baby around makes me wish to have at least one hand free at all times - but not with this pump! The material appears to be so cheap, light and thin that I was afraid to break it while using.I have used other breast pumps, but this one is the worst. I managed to get only 1/2 of the milk amount out of my breasts of what I usually pump. Even if you use it only from time to time, this pump is absolutely inadequate. And by the way - pumping doesn't have to hurt as much as it does with this pump!Ladies - save your money and buy a different product!"
2,Ouch,I bought this pump before leaving the hospital and it was a waste of money. It hurt like heck and did not express enough milk to relieve my engorgement. The motor cycles very slowly so when it's tugging on me all I can think is ouch...ouch...ouch... I ended up buying a used Pump-in-Style online and love it. I can pump both sides at once in less than 10 minutes and have a good-sized bottle to show for it.
1,Very noisy not for working moms,It is soooo noisy... Invest in an Avent ISIS or Medela Pump in Style.
5,A must have,"I nurse my baby exclusively and am a stay at home mom, but this is really handy for when we go out and can't schedule around his feeding times. I didn't have any problems with let down. It does make noise, but it's not noisy. I only pump at home so it doesn't bother me. I only used this after my baby was 6 weeks and had no problems whatsoever."
1,Too good to be true,This item was too good to be true. This compact unit had a lot of promise but didn't have any suction. Never could get it to produce any milk.
1,Noisy,I have this pump and I found it difficult to use after awhile and the pump is way too noisy for my use. I'm an occasional user and it was quite painful to pump and I don't mind the time it takes to pump but I would prefer if it was less noisy.
2,Disappointed!!!,"I was really excited to find a Medela pump i could afford, but after 2 months of trial and error, I am giving up and buying a new pump. This pump is loud, rough on my breasts and after 30 minutes of pumping I can only get out 1 ounce or less. Also it is already loosing suction. Save your $60 and put it towards a quality pump. I am getting the Lanisoah double pump. I have researched it a lot and it is the only pump i cant find a truly bad review on. Everyone is different and if you have very small breasts and are only wanting to pump a couple times a week this pump may work for you, but I would not recommend it to a friend."
3,Loud. Really.,"I read the reviews that warned that this thing was loud, but I thought ""who cares?"" As it turns out, it really does matter. If I want to pump in the middle of the night, I have to risk waking everyone up. I can't watch TV while pumping because I can't hear dialogue. If my preschooler sees the pump he talks about how loud it is and starts imitating the noise. I can't pump on one side while the baby is feeding on the other side, because she wonders what the heck is going on. It's kind of hard to have a let-down reflex with all of the racket. Functionally I don't have any complaints - it gets the milk out, and it's nice that it's battery-operated. But I'll probably go spend the money for the pump in style. Wish I had done that to begin with."
1,low suction,"After about 5 uses the suction was low. It didn't matter what setting you placed it on, It was so low milk did not express from the breast even if my breast were engorged. I now have to spend more money then expected for a pump."
1,Very poor quality and hardly effective- save your money.,My local WIC office gave me this pump when my First Year's pump seemed like it was on the fritz. Let's just say I went back to my old pump because it still worked better than this one even when it wasn't working right. This one is just a huge waste of time and money. The suction is poor and unnatural and I can't even get let down with it. I can barely get an ounce out of a side at a time. I've borrowed one of Medela's higher end pumps from a friend in the past and thought that this one would carry on with the company's high quality and standards that I'm used to but it definitely does not! Don't waste your time and money. Look around for another pump instead.
1,Very disappointed,"After using the Medela Symphony pump, I was fairly disappointed with this one. It's super slow and very loud, I can't get much milk pumped out with it. If I had known better, I would have bought the Swing pump instead... I imagine that a hand-held pump might be better than this one too. I should've done better research before buying this."
3,Deluxe,I searched and read every review trying to get an idea of what i wanted and i'm so glad women post reviews it is very helpful. I was recommended by a friend to get this pump. Its been great for what i need it for. Mine did stop sucking but medella's customer service was so kind and sent me a new one no problem. To be honest i wish i would have just gotten an expensive nice one to last me a while. To use for future babies. This one is quite loud and it takes a little while to pump. The one thing i love about it is it takes batteries and it plugs in.
1,Dont waste your money!!!,"I originally bought this pump because it came highly recommended but I found it to be a waste of time and money. The first one had to be returned because the adapter didnt work and it EATS batteries! The second one worked for exactly 2 minutes before the adapter overheated and gave out. We came home with the third one this afternoon and sure enough the adapter konked out in minutes. I tried it in many other outlets with no luck. Im upset, my husband is frustrated ( he brought out his toolbox and took the mechanism apart in order to fix the problem) and all because of this pump. Luckily, I bought the Avent manual pump in addition to the Medela and I can express with ease. It may take longer to express and more effort but I can watch tv while I pump - it is not as noisy as the medela - and it works!"
1,Buy the Pump In Style instead,"I bought this pump because Medela is always spoken of so highly but it was loud, did not pump out much at all, and it hurt. I saw friends with the Pump In Style and was so envious of the short time it took to get a good amount of milk. I returned this product because it was useless and a friend lent me her Isis Manual pump which works much better and feels much better for my occasional useage."
1,Mixed feelings,"My sister-in-law insisted the medela mini was ""the BEST"" so I purchased it. I was shocked at how loud it was!! I only used it on occasion. It was great for traveling, for going out on dates with hubby, or just getting out. I do not reccomend using it in public restrooms because it is so loud. I could hear children ask their mom,""what's going on in there?""I went to use it again with my next child and it doesn't work!I am very disappointed!! I paid more for the best knowing that I would have more children. I called medela and the MAN there wasn't helpful at all. He said the warranty was only good for 6 months. They should tell you if it has a limited life span."
1,Medela should be embarrassed to sell this,"I have used other Medela products and was always happy with the other pumps. This pump is not worth the money. Buy a good hand pump instead, you will get more milk. The Medela Harmony hand pump is much better. This pump is LOUD and also INEFFECTIVE."
4,"Pumps well, just too loud",This little electrical pump works well. It's only problem is that it's really noisy. I have twins and this pump works just fine.
1,doesn't work,"I had this pump on my registry but then was also given a double electric pump (Medela Pump in Style) all I can say is GOOD THING I HAD THE DOUBLE PUMP! This single electric one just cannot get enough pressure/suction/whatever. plus even if it DID work, a single pump means double the pumping time. I know double electric pumps are expensive, but beg, borrow, get your family to go in it as a gift - you NEED it and this single pump is NOT an adequate substitute for a real pump! You can even rent a double pump from the hospital or a lactation consultant. Just don't bother trying this one."
2,Tragic pump...,"Just opened the box... used this pump once. What an embarrassment for Medela! Yikes! The motor is SOOOO LOUD... my husband said, ""you'll wake up the baby!"" The pump action is SOOOOO SLOW... I could pump much faster manually! Don't waste your money."
2,definitely only for OCCASSIONAL use...,"I bought this pump back in 2003 when I was pregnant with my 1st...I used it VERY rarely as I just did not like to pump, period, regardless of the type of pump I had...it worked fine for the occassional bottle when I was not going to be near my son...I used it the same way with my second son, and had no real complaints for occassional use. However, now with my 3rd, I have run into the problem of very sore, cracked nipples and needed some relief for a day or so until they healed to fully resume breastfeeding. This pump has totally lost suction after only about 3 days of pumping for relief of sore nipples. I am rather disappointed, but I guess when they say for ""occassional"" use, they really mean it!!!"
1,Save your money and time!,"This pump is very slow so unless you have 45 minutes to an hour to pump 4 ounces, don't get this. In addition to being slow, it began leaking while in use and this is only after being SPARINGLY used for 5 months. It's a waste of money all around!"
2,not worth it,"This pump was reccomended to me by a friend who loved it. I wanted to get a pump for the convenience of having extra milk if i get tired or to use when we are out. I used it, once a day, for a several weeks but i realized that i am not pumping enough (less than 2 ounces) after 30 mins. I thought i was loosing my milk supply. It became a time consuming task to pump 3 ounces of milk. The motor was very loud as well. I stopped using it. My daughter is now 3 months old and I am still breastfeeding her and substituting formula when we go out. If I had to do it all over again I would not buy this product."
4,Great pump for traveling!,"I used this pump while traveling so that I didn't have to lug around my Pump N Style on the plane (along with my baby, stroller, car seat, diaper bag, purse, & carry-on). It's so small & easy to pack. The motor is noisy, but really, that's my only complaint. I'd rather have the noise, than have to carry around my large pump when traveling. I also wanted to be sure that my large & expensive pump wasn't at risk for breaking while traveling with it. Great travelling pump!!!"
3,Noisy pump!,"I bought this pump when my baby was less than a week old. She's almost five months now, and I still use it. I like it because it pumps a large quantity of milk in a relatively short time. What I don't like about it, though, is the noise. You cannot carry on a conversation, watch TV or be near a sleepy baby while using this pump. It's simply too loud. It's also not the most comfortable if your breasts are larger. The plastic is very hard and inflexible, and larger breasts don't fit very comfortably in it. I'm told you can buy an adaptor item for this problem, for an additional cost. I did buy a manual pump from another company a few months ago, and if I had it to do over again, I would probably just buy that one and forgo this one. It hasn't worked out like I had hoped."
3,"Extrae muy bien, pero el sonido es fuerte","Como extractor de leche lo considero muy bueno, en 20 minutos puedo extraerme 6onzas, pero el sonido que emite el aparato es fuerte, es como un ruido bastante desagradable."
1,Save your money or invest in a Pump in Style,"I got this pump because I only needed to pump for an occasional short separation from my daughter. This was the pump that Medela recommended for my needs, however, the pump is so weak that it was a total waste of money (I used it once and now it's in the closet gathering dust). I ended up getting a Pump in Style, which is great. It was a little more, but hey, I'm saving a lot by breastfeeding, and it really has been a godsend - I can pump and go out knowing that my little one doesn't have to settle for formula. If you want to pump, don't bother with this one - manual expression of milk would be just as fast!"
1,Not a good pump,I recieved this pump as a gift after my avent isis broke. I found the pump to be loud uncomfortable and difficult to let down with. after using it for 30 minutes I was only able to espress 1 ounce. My baby hatesthe noises when I try to pump and feed at the same time and wont eat until I turn it off. I bought another Isis and am happier with it.
1,Not worth the money!,"I bought this pump at the recommendation of some breast feeding experts...apparently they never used one! The suction on this pump is terrible, which makes the noise of the motor that much more annoying. I did give it one star because it actually did express milk, but hand expression was more enjoyable and I could do it just as fast. I was very disappointed to have spent [price] only to find myself buying another pump!"
2,Great if you don't mind...,"...the noise, the pain, and the time you spend for just a couple of ounces! I bought this pump because the brand was highly recommended by everyone at the hospital, and I wasn't going to use it more than once a day, but it wasn't at all what I expected. I had to use it while I fed my baby because otherwise I could only get about 2 ounces and it took almose 10 minutes to get that much. It was soooo loud that the baby was too startled to keep nursing. And if I kept it pumping for more than 2-3 minutes it would hurt my nipples(even with the incert). I would have to use it for a couple of minutes then stop, wait a minute, and start again. Maybe the motor was bad. The manager at Babies R' US took it back but she said maybe I just got a ""lemon"" and I should exchange it for another one. I declined and I'm going to do a little more research before I buy another breast pump. Before you buy make sure to ask about the return policy bacause some stores do take them back."
1,Don't waste your money,"I used this pump 5 times before it broke. Then I took it back to Babies R Us to see if I could exchange it. Babies R Us could not exchange it because it is a personal item but customer service was able to give me a new motor for the pump. Apparently there is a known problem with this item.Well, the new motor was not any good so I called the manufacturer. They were more than happy to take the pump back for credit toward the ""Pump in Style"" ([$$$]..ouch).I now have the ""Pump in Style"" and it is great! Spend the money on the better pump, it's worth it!"
3,i love this pump but...,My local lacation consultant recommended this pump for my needs and I love it. The only problem with it is that the transformer blew on me twice. Medela has replaced it for free both times because it is under warranty. The suction is a little weak but I do not do any heavy duty pumping. The pump has been wonderful for my needs and I would recommend it to a friend who is returning to work. It is a little noisy but my co-workers know I am nursing so it doesn't bother me if they know I am pumping!
3,A good beginning book,"If you totally don't know where to start on prepping for the LSAT, this is about a good a place as any.The book has 3 real LSATs, although they're kind of old and probably not truly indicative of the type of questions you are likely to encounter on test day.Still, it's good for giving you a feel for the test, the sections in it and some basic ways to attack the test.If you are serious about prep though, you'll probably want to pick up additional material on logic games and logical reasoning that are more in depth as well as tons of recent LSATs to practice with."
2,Disappointed!,"This book isn't as good as I thought it would be. I found the Princeton Review's ""Cracking the LSAT"" to be a million times better. Kaplan does a poor job in the Logical Reasoning and Analytical Reasoning sections. They only skim through the material and, honestly, their advice isn't very good. I found Cracking the LSAT to be thorough with excellent test taking tactics, especially for the Games. Cracking the LSAT has the best explanation for handling the Games that I've ever seen. Kaplan's Reading Comprehension section was better than the other sections, although not that adequate. However, Kaplan's RC section was better than Cracking the LSAT. I guess that's why I'm giving this book 2 stars, instead of just 1."
4,Kaplan LSAT Program,This text is so comprehensive that you must have alot of time or take alot of time to review everything. We'll have to wait and see how much it boosts my practice LSAT score!
5,"Makes the ""Boys in the Band"" seem like child's play",This is a nitty gritty view of why AIDS research is dragging in this country. We're brought to tears as our frustration levels rise when reading this book. It makes us want to fax hundreds of letters to the NY Times asking that President Clinton read this book and get moving to resolve the situation. Perfect reading for the beach..
4,A lot of fun & surf history in this documentary about the real Gidget!,"Any fan of the 1960's, surfing, and pop culture history will love this documentary about the original surfer girl - Gidget! From the earliest days of surfing to the hot young ladies who ride the waves today (and get paid for doing so!) this documentary looks at the story of one of the first gals who saw what the boys at the beach were doing and said, ""I can do that!"" Who knew that the famous book, movies, and tv shows were all based on a little lady from Malibu named Kathy? Lots of great retro beach footage & interviews with legends of the waves, modern day pro surfers, Academy Award winners Sally Field and the late Cliff Robertson, and narrated by Jorja Fox (from CSI). An entertaining and educational DVD the whole family can enjoy!"
5,For surfers and non-surfers,"My wife has never been on a surfboard in her life while I have surfed for 47 years. I got this DVD because I am aware of Kathy's environmental work and also interested in the story beyond the movies and tv shows. As a surfer, the movie was engrossing as it featured a who's who of surfers from the early days who all knew ""Gidget"" and it was interesting to see how this young girl got involved with famous surfers who were instrumental in the sports early days as well as her relationships with those that were on the entertainment side (movies, tv) of the Gidget story. Even more important was the reaction of my wife who enjoyed this equally as much as I did. It's one of those movies that when you realize it's coming to an end wish it would keep on going."
1,Don't replace with this!,I bought this battery when I lost the original. This battery simply won't fit in the charger or in the camera properly. It took me a fight to squeeze it in the camera. I don't recommend this battery at all. Look for the original Panasonic.
2,Shake'n Not Stirred,"This bottling system has the right idea about convenience and perfect storing capabilities, however you can not shake these without them leaking because of the rings, and I definitely would not use them in the freezer. We switched to the Premium design made by Playtex! They are great. Hope this helps."
5,These Are A Must Have,"I received the complete nurser starter bottle set as a baby shower gift, which came with both standard disposable liners and the drop-ins. I found the standard ones almost impossible to use and when I tried the drop-ins, I instantly fell in love. They are so very easy to use and make bottle preparation so much easier, especially in the middle of the night! :o)"
4,Good to have around,"I put this set in my registry because these particular bottles have a good reputation.And, believe me, my son loves it!It especially came in handy when I discovered that when my son came out of the hospital, he started to choke on regular nipples.These don't go down his throat as much, so I can definately avoid choking.You can also take the air out of the bags, so it takes away most of the gas."
3,Time consuming and expensive,"I used these for my 1st baby. Everyone said how they were the best for preventing gassy tummies. It got expensive to buy all the liners. On top of that, my baby was still very gassy. I used Johnson's Healthflow bottles for my second and also a few regular type bottles too. She had less gas problems than my 1st. Now for our 3rd, we're going to try the Avent bottles. I've heard great things about those. Disposable is expensive."
5,Nothing Compares!,I have three children and have breastfed all of them. They refuse to take any other bottle besides playtex drop ins with the rubber nipple. It is the closet thing to mom and not to mention the best price. I've tired other brands and nothing compares! WE LOVE THESE BOTTLES!!!
4,Great Bottles,"I started out on the Avent bottles becasue that seemd to be the big hype. Everyone was telling me how good they are, so I bought some. Well, not for my baby. Then I went along with what both my sisters used and bought the playtex starter set. EXCELLENT. The flow is perfect and it is very easy to get all the air our of it. Plus, I love just dropping in a sterilized bag. The only downside is that the bags don't measure perfectly, so what I do is just measure in a standard bottle and then pour it into the drop in. No big deal for me, but it may be a hassle for some. Other than that, I would highly reccommend these bottles. The box even has a measuring hole that you can put your nipple in to test if it is worn out or not (just look on the side flap). Hope this helps."
5,The only bottles for my babies!!!!!,"Four years ago our son was born. I knew for a fact the I would be breastfeeding but what about bottles. I was completely lost on which brand was the best to use. I did my research and read the reviews. The Playtex disposable set seemed to be the best choice for me and baby. (His Pediatrician also receommened them above the rest to control gas intake.) It was wonderful! These bottles were easy to clean, easy to fill, and a joy to give to my son. I watched the plastic bags deflate as he drank and it felt good to know that he wasn't taking in excessive air. My son rarely had gas and spat up even less than that. I also loved the convenience of the diposable drop-ins and liners. The drop-ins are more convenient but I found that the liners held more liquid. We are expecting our second child in March and without a doubt the Playtex disposable set is the only one for me. Your baby will thank you too!!!"
5,Expensive isn't always better,"I used the Playtex bottles with my 1st child and loved the ease of disposable bottles. With my 2nd child I mistakenly thought expensive would be better and bought all the Avent bottles. The Avent bottles did not reduce colic like the advertising claimed, and the silicone nipples were easily bit into when my son chewed on them. The Avent bottle liners are also flimsy, they leaked often. I'm pregnant with my 3rd and definately reverting back to the Playtex bottles. With the drop-ins they are even easier to use than before!"
5,Great bottles,"My son is 5 months old and still loves these bottles. I have added other bottles to the daily routine (Gerber Traditions) and he likes them but actually these drop ins are more convenient, easier and fast, especially during night time feedings. To warm them all you require is some hot tap water and a few minutes (I just run hot tap water and drop the bottle in it for 3 mins. ) and presto, warm bottle. Since he just started holding his own bottle we still use the smaller ones, just more of them more often. The best feature is the fact that you can remove all of the air from them so they baby has less gas. This is especially helpful with an a newborn."
2,Doesn't seal very well...,"I got these as a gift at my baby shower, so I haven't had a chance to use them until now. Since I'm breastfeeding, I don't use them on a regular basis, just for outings. You can't pump into these, which is a bit of a hassle, but it's not too bad. My problem with the bottle is that the bags don't stay in. The ring doesn't hold the bag in, so when I went to feed the baby, he ended up soaked. Needless to say, bottle feeding that day was a disaster. If the bag would stay in, I'd say I really liked these. Unfortunately, I haven't had one bag stay in yet..."
2,Not what I expected,"I bought these thinking they would be great.I was wrong. I give my baby breast milk and its just a hassle. I figured I would be saving time because I wouldn't have to clean a ton of bottles everyday. Well, you aren't able to heat the bottles with the liners in them so you have to get a container dirty anyway to warm the milk and then dump them back into the bottle. Plus you have to keep buying the drop-ins. If I'm going to have to clean bottles anyway I'd rather use a bottle that I can store milk in AND heat the milk in.These bottles dont keep air out. Even when I would squish all of the air out of the bag and put the lid on, by the time I went and got my baby and put a bib on her all of the air was back into the bottle. Also they are not good for on the go. There is nothing to protect the liner on the bottom so anything could puncture it making all of the milk leak out.I also dont think they are close to being like breast feeding at all"
5,Best for pumping moms,"I love that you can pump, freeze and feed all from the same liner. You have to buy the Playtex pump adapter kit to be able to do that but I think its still much cheaper than using milk storage bags. Clean up couldn't be easier either, just throw it away. That feature is great when traveling as well. You don't have to worry about your bottles not being clean because you use a fresh liner and the milk stays there until baby gets it, not getting transferred around from bottle to bag to bottle again. I also liked that the liner was able to collapse on itself and didn't for a vacuum for baby to fight against like some bottles do. I did have a few issues with the bottles leaking if they weren't screwed on just right but I think that happens if any bottle isn't screwed on right. Bottom line is my Huband and I loved the Playtex system for breastmilk feeding/storage and we still use it now that we switched to formula at 9 months."
5,"My favorite bottles, and the babies love them too!","I have twins, so I need something quick and easy. These bottles are it! They are durable, wash great in the dishwasher, my babies love them, and I couldn't be happier. The babies latch well to these nipples when feeding and take in minimal air, which helps reduce tummy discomfort. The standard 8oz drop-in liners fit in these bottles MUCH better than they do in the ""designer"" bottles because these bottles are slightly talller. We did purchase silicone nipples separately as our babies preferred them to the rubber. My first child loved these bottles, and our recent additions love them, too."
2,It's just okay:(,"I bought these because my son had some serious gas problems with other bottles. I don't like the fact that you have to constantly buy drop-ins. They also leak pretty badly and my son had a hard time latching on, no matter which nipple we tried. All in all, I probably wouldn't buy these again."
2,Leaky!!,"These bottles have to be set upward. I threw them in the daiper bag, and they leaked on more than one occasion. I am changing bottles becasue they are such a pain."
4,Works with pump - sort of,"When I bought this system, I was concerned if it would be compatible with the pump I chose (Ameda Purely Yours Ultra). The answer is - only if you also buy the Playtex Breast Milk Storage Kit. The kit comes with the adapters that you need.With respect to the nipples that come with this set, our baby eventually got used to them, but it took a few days."
4,Gotta Give Credit Where Credit is Due,"I bought these bottles after trying the Avent bottles, Dr. Brown's bottles and Johnson's Healthflow. I breastfeed exclusively but when I need to get out, I leave a bottle and my daughter refused everything I tried. I love the Avent pump so of course I was hard pressed to use their bottles--it just seemed logical. Well my daughter had other plans. When I purchased these bottles I laughed to myself and thought, ""won't it be funny if she likes these bottles which are SO much less expensive than the others."" Well lo and behold, she did and I have to give credit where it is due. I still love the Avent brest pump but I have to say my daughter does not care for their bottles so I guess until I go back to using a bottle, we are going to stay with Playtex. (with all of the Avent and other bottles I now have, I may have to start using a bottle to drink.) Babies know best I guess."
2,Dont waste your money,"I used these type bottles with my first baby and liked them just fine, but the truth is they dont make babies less gassy and they dont eliminate air from getting inside babies tummies. Now that I have twins I realized I would be wasting [money] on drop in liners for no good reason. Lets face it, kids are gonna get gas bubbles, thats why you burp them often!!"
2,Thank Goodness I Didn't Pay For These!,"I had received a couple of these bottles at my baby shower and decided to give them a try. I had been using the J&J Healthflow and Evenflo systems, but I thought that with the Playtex system being easier to clean and more convienent (which is why I gave it 2 stars), why not see if baby likes it. My 1 month old son hated it!!! He has an impossible time figuring out how to grasp onto the nipple and gets so frustrated that he loses interest in eating. when he did finally get how to grasp on to it, it took him 20+ minutes to eat 4oz, which believe me is forever!! Plus they say that with the collapsable insert there's little gas, well from the burps my son was ripping I beg to differ. He had just as many burps with the Playtex as he had with the other systems. Rather than have it take up space in my cupboards, I gave it to a friend of mine who is expecting and happily went back to the Johnson & Johnson and the Evenflo."
1,Very disappointed,"I bought the set thinking that it was similar to the newer edition of the Nurser, which I already had but needed more bottles for convenience. I was very disappointed. The lids leaked and the nipple rings leaked and the bottle plastic seemed cheap. I used it for about a week and then got rid of it."
1,Best bottles I have found,"I have three children. For the first one, I bought all those curved Healthflow bottles to keep the air out of my daughter's system. Big Pain!!. They were hard to clean. I used the Playtex bottles for my two younger children. They are much easier to clean. I could even put the rings and caps in my dishwasher. I would recommend these bottles to any mother. There are a variety of nipple shapes available to experiment with. My daughter liked the natural brown ones and my son liked the rounded top in the brown and silicone varieties."
5,Bottle Love,"Now I am a big fan of other wide-neck bottles, but when on the go these are my absolute favorite. Mainly because you can just pop the cap right onto the bottom. It really helps to keep up with it. Drop in bottles are awesome period though. Definitely a time saver."
4,Decent buy,"Not a bad price for all of the items included. I wish they gave more nipples though. They give several drop-in liners, 4 oz and 8 oz. But for the price, its worth it."
5,Excellent book!,"With her second novel Lord of the Keep, Ms. Lawrence proves she deserved the accolades she received with her debut book Virtual Heaven. In LOTK, she skillfully spins a stunning love story between Gilles D'Argent, the Lord; and Emma, a weaver and single mother in Medieval times. The plot involves all the key components of wonderful storytelling, with strong, empassioned characters fighting both inner demons and external forces in order to be together. Ms. Lawrence's talent shines through as she creates a tale of people that grips you by the heart and won't let go until the very end. This is a must read!"
2,Dissapointed,"I was looking forward to reading this book when I bought it from the book store. What a dissapointment, the book was drawn out, the heroine got on my nerves. She kept putting herself in situations with William. She know how he is why try and talk to him he's a SOB. Gilles got on my nerves about his age get over it. The book just wasn't good even from the beginning."
2,Imperfect hero,"Hard to believe they published this one in the ""Perfect Heroes"" series.Our ""Hero"" cheated on his wife while she was pregnant,raised his [illegitamate] son to be a real [jerk], then seduced said [jerk]'s common law wife into becoming his mistress in order keep her own [illegitamate] child from starving. Heck of a nice guy,huh? Obviously, the heroine is not the sharpest knife in the drawer, either. The characters in Ms. Lawrence's other books""Virtual Heaven""&""Virtual Desire"" may have been fantasy figures, but at least they were likeable and somewhat nice."
3,Not the best for smaller bottles,"The warmer always gets 4 oz bottles too warm, no matter how much water you out it. The larger bottles sometimes don't get warm enough. My baby had colic and waiting for the bottles was torture. I gave this unit to charity."
3,Not easy to use,"I also had a hard time getting bottles warmed up just right...I had to constantly shake the bottles and then re-heat to get an all over even temperature due to uneven heating. It's much quicker to warm bottles with hot water, however, it is very convenient to warm bottles upstairs in the middle of the night."
4,Best night saver,I received this as a shower present and I love. The only problem is when I put in a full bottle it tends to get too hot. It scolded my daughters mouth. I have to keep testing the formula to make sure that it is not too hot. Other than this instance I love the product.
1,A waste of money and a fire hazard,I recieved two of this bottle warmer for my baby showers. The heating element on both burnt out within a month of use. The second one smoked and caught fire causing a fire hazard. Thank goodness I was in the room when it did this. When it did work it was either too hot or too cold. Sometimes when purchasing a product that doesn't work right you could say that you just got the bad one in the bunch but when two of the same product have the same problems I think it is poor manufacturing. Save your money. The bottle in the pan worked much better for me.
3,Handy and As Reliable as Anyone Can Expect,"A dedicated steam warmer is definitely better than any other option such as a pan of water on the stove (takes too long) or the microwave (danger of uneven heating; robs contents of nutrients).We have ours in a second-story nursery and have been pleased with it. The only problem is that the results can be unpredictable - sometimes one capful of water will do the trick just fine, sometimes the bottle feels hot but the milk inside still cold, and sometimes it just goes to town and overheats the contents. Nonetheless, I figure any heating process will be unpredictable, so I can't fault this model.The unit comes with adapters to hold any standard 4- or 9-oz. bottle; we've used Avent with no problems."
1,Thought it would be a great item!,"I too had the same problems with this warmer. It took forever to find the right amount of water it took to warm the bottles, because what the directions said was incorrect. Then once you did find the correct amount of water the amount of formula changed and you would have to start again. Bottles were always too hot or too cold!!!!! The cooler doesn't hold the Johnson's Healthflow 8oz bottles and the Playtex ventaire bottles don't work in a bottle warmer! Very disappointed with this item, but by the time you find out how much you can't return it because it has been a month or so. Beware!! Don't buy this product. Thank goodness for this website and rating system."
1,Infuriating,"As liberal arts majors with no background in chemistry, we have ourselves to blame for the nightly confusion on how to work the babypro bottle warmer. It is beyond me how anyone gets this thing to work properly. The instructions are worthless, the warming uneven and it often takes l5 minutes to cool an overheated bottle. DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF CRAP.We wish we read the reviews here before we picked this one up at the store, it's an infuriating nightmare of a product and I've often thought about throwing it out."
1,"Works well for about a month, then goes downhill ...","I bought this warmer because I thought it would be a great idea for those nighttime feedings. Well, I never used it beside the bed and just last week we ended up buying another warmer because this one stopped warming bottles. The little water holders are a nuisance as well because they are hard to manipulate and fill to the proper spot in the middle of the night when you are so tired that you can't see straight.We switched to the Munchkin bottle warmer available at Target and couldn't be happier. It heats faster, has an on/off switch, and an alarm when the bottle is done heating.I wouldn't waste my money on this warmer."
1,Terrible product!,What a complete disappointment! The warming mechanism is completely worthless. Our Dr. Brown's bottles never heated up...at all! We are first time parents looking for a convenience. This was a complete waste of money. We returned it the next day.
2,OK Product but somewhat useless,"I had bought this before my daughter was born thinking I would really use it, especially during the night. But since I was breastfeeding I didn't use it for the first 6 months and then tried it a few times but thought it was more time consuming than the microwave. I never used it in the night since by then my daughter didn't need any more feedings during nightime.Overall, I wouldn't recommend this product if you intent to breastfeed and even if not, the microwave is just so much faster and in about 30 sec. the bottle was always just right."
1,Horrid Product,"My husband and I hate this product, the milk is either too cold or too hot. The best way we have found is heat water in the microwave and let the bottle sit in it for about 30 - 45 ses. It is quicker, easier and cheaper. DO NOT BUY THIS JUNK."
4,Great warmer - just not for bottles with inserts,"I have to say I have not been disappointed with this warmer, other than it should not be used with the Playtex inserts bottles (which is why it gets 4 stars) as it cannot sense the heat properly and makes them way too hot and doesn't shut off. My best advice? Read the directions! I was shocked at how little water it uses and thought I was reading it wrong. Do not use more water than the directions say for your bottle size! It is correct, and when followed it heats the bottle perfectly every time. All of the water disappeared and the light turns off when it's done. I honestly cannot understand how people could say they read the directions and it still didn't work, but hey that's just me. Definitely recommend! If you have the inserts, you can always use a plastic bottle and pour it in. A must have for when baby is home with daddy, grandma, or anyone else that doesn't have a ton of experience with properly heating a bottle (esp. breastmilk)."
2,Inconsistency,"Inconsistency in temperature. Too bulky to bring out.. the handles comes off when carried. I've used this everyday for the past 7 months.. Wish I got something smaller, so I can carry outside and use."
1,Bad product. Do not buy,"This bottle warmer melted the first bottle we tried. It was a bottle made for the medela pumps, so not cheap plastic or anything like that. It also says in the instructions that standard size bottles are 4 or 8 oz. The Gerber and medela bottles are made for 5 oz and I think those are standard size. We tried to adjust it accordingly but the milk got too hot. It is too hard to use. Will be returning it."
2,too much effort at 2 am,"We did not care for this product. It sounded like a good idea, but it was too much effort in the middle of the night. It is hard to figure out how much water to put into the small steamers and as a result we either overheated or underheated many bottles. I don't know that this is a necessary product for new parents, b/c our daughter would take a room temperature bottle... we used powdered formula so we would just mix bottles as we needed them with room temperature water. Even then if our daughter fussed, we could just run the bottle under warm water to heat it up before a feeding. We are expecting baby number 2 in June and we probably won't be using this product. Live and learn as they say."
1,Dangerous product!,I'm returning this product. I followed the directions and the unit heated the bottle until it was far too hot for a baby. Please be cautious with this warmer.
1,Did not work for me,"This item did not work for me at all. It would either warm up the bottles too much or not at all. I would use the proper amount as sugggested to warm up my 4 oz bottles, but they would end up extremly hot so I would have to spend some more time cooling them. Then I tried warming up the 6oz bottles and it wouldn't warm them up at all. I'm not sure if I used either too much water or what.. i just never figured it out. Also, the bottles weren't really kept cool. I did fill up the plastic container with water and froze it.. its just that around 5am the water in the container was a room tempature at that point the bottle didn't need to be warm up at all.. may be I over reacted.. but I'm a first time mom and i just felt uneasy about the bottles being at room tempature. Anyways, finally I gave up and bought the Munchkin Healthflow Deluxe Bottle and Food Warmer and it works great!!"
4,Great Product but...,I can honestly say I love this bottle warmer because it is very convenient for those in a 2-story house. We loved being able to keep the bottle cool and save the trip downstairs in the middle of the night. Even when my son was sleeping through the night we still kept his morning bottle in his room and used this warmer to keep it cool. But...I was very disappointed that my Dr. Brown's bottles were too wide for the warmer. The taller Dr. Brown's bottle fit in the warmer but were too tall to fit in the cooler. I ended up still using the cooler but storing the Dr. Brown's bottles in there without the nipple and cap on so they would fit. My only suggestion would be to make the warmer wider so all bottles can fit.
4,i wish i had gotten one sooner!,"This bottle warmer was such a life saver! I only wish I had gotten one sooner. We purchased ours when our son was almost two months old, and it was so convenient for nighttime feedings! With the nightlight on the front, I never had to turn on another light, even for diaper changes. Now our son is sleeping through the night, but I still use the warmer for every bottle, and will soon be able to use it for baby food jars. The only complaint is that the little containers for water were a bit hard to get open without spilling water everywhere, but I just keep a small bottle of water next to the warmer and use that instead. It was hard to get the water amount right at first, but trial runs with regular milk helped get the right amount to heat the bottles not too hot!"
1,Too much effort in the middle of the night!,I thought this was a great idea when I registered for it. I envisioned myself never having to leave my room in the middle of the night. I was wrong. The first time I used it the bottle was still too cold. The next time I added a little more water and let it run the full 4 minutes (felt more like 4 hours). That time the bottle was way too hot (2 oz.of formula in a 4 oz.Avent bottle). That was the last time I used it. I felt that it was faster and easier to go into the kitchen and heat the bottle on the stove or in the microwave. Luckily my daughter is a good sleeper so I do not have to heat bottles in the middle of the night anymore. I would not recommend this to anyone unless they live in such a huge house that it is way too difficult to walk to the kitchen in the middle of the night.
2,This product is dangerous,"I liked this product until I heated a bottle for my son, then tested the milk first and found that it was hot enough to burn me. Granted, I was making a 2 oz. bottle, which is all my son would drink at first, but there is no way to change the temperature for a bottle that is not 4 or 8 oz. No matter the size, it takes several minutes to heat a bottle, which was way too long for my screaming baby in the middle of the night. It was faster to run a bottle under warm water or to mix a new one using powdered formula and room temperature water. I found this product to be mostly useless."
1,"Didn't work, pain to return it","The light came on when I turned on the switch but the heating mechanism didn't work. Unfortunately I didn't try to use it until I needed it in the middle of the night. Called First Years and they are sending me a label to return it. So that means I have to find a box to ship it, go and mail it, and wait for them to receive and then mail back a new one. How long will that take?? Not impressed with their customer service."
1,Unreliable,"This is an invitation to frustration! These steam warmers make it very hard to control the temperature. Too hot or too cold! And if it is too cold the first time, the unit will not allow you reheat right away. Yu have to wait a few minutes. All of this is too much for a hunrgy baby. Don't buy any of the steam warmers. I have had great success with the Dex electric bottle warmer. It shuts off when the right temp is achieved."
3,Could be easier,This product works but adding water with a screaming baby is hard. I prefilled the little containers but even getting them open was hard with infant in arm.
2,Not as convenient as it should be.,"The concept is great, but the heating element flawed. I was using the small Avent bottles to heat powdered formula, and no matter how much water I'd put in, the bottle was always either too cold or too hot. Somehow using ready-to-feed formula in a Breastflow bottle yielded slightly better results, erring on the cold side, but still, the second-guessing obscured the convenience of this warmer. What's the use if I had to make my hungry baby wait while I went to the bathroom to refill the vial so as to reheat the bottle?In the end I determined that this warmer works as intended when using breastmilk in a Breastflow bottle. For me, this means it won't be used very often. Too bad--I think I could've loved this thing."
4,Pretty good!,"I got 2 of these at my baby shower (one for upstairs and one for downstairs) and I absolutely love them! They steam pretty quick and I like how you can keep pre-measured water on it. When baby's hungry I just grab the bottle from the fridge, grab the little flask of water that's attached, pour it in, and press the button. I've had to warm bottles twice sometimes but it's still faster than warming water on the stove or running the bottle under the faucet. Oh, I only do 2 oz. bottles for now."
1,Returned already,"Terrible. The directions are incredibly complicated. When I finally sat down and read them, I set everything up to warm a bottle and all it did was steam the water - the water in the bottle was still ice cold! Good in theory but terrible execution!"
1,A waste of time and money,"This warmer is terrible. It is very inconsistent, sometimes over heating and sometimes under heating, despite the fact that we measure out the water each time. It also needs to be cleaned every day to prevent rust from collecting on the surface of the hot plate, thus warming our baby's milk in brown water. Needless to say we've resorted back to the old fashioned method for now. I implore you not to purchase this product unless you enjoy delaying feeding and standing at the sink, or sitting waiting for hot milk to cool, with a crying baby in your arms."
2,Doesn't warm your bottles or keep them cool!,"I was very disappointed by this warmer. It seemed great! Not only would it warm your bottles, but it would keep cold ready made ones for late night feedings. IT DOESN'T WARM YOUR BOTTLES OR KEEP THEM COLD! Save your money! DON'T BUY THIS."
1,Disappointed,"Very disappointed. It does not warm the thin bottles, like Evenflo. It does warm the larger bottles, like Avent. After three months of using it, the button you push to warm it, broke. I'm sending it back to the manufacturer."
2,not for me,"I really did not like this. We had a warmer that submerses the bottle in water, and we found this worked faster and better. We got this as a second hoping to use it upstairs at night. Decided to just buy a second warmer that uses water, and to use a cooler for the bottles (our baby needed 4 anyway to get through the night)"
3,These reviews confuse me even more,Im trying to decide what to get off an Amway gift card. This bottle warmer was one of the options. They have many other products but a bottle warmer sounds great IF it works. However how am I supposed to know if it does or not? The reviews are extremely mixed.56 - 5 star62 - 4 star28 - 3 star35 - 2 stars72 - 1 starThe combined 5 star and 4 star ratings encourage me to choose this product but then the awful 1 star and 2 star rating discourage me. One reviewer even said its a fire hazard. Others say its great and warms the bottles if you follow instructions. Then people say it doesn't warm them at all. I've never read such extremely different sided reviews on one product.
5,Alternative use!,"Babies are grown and out of the house. My wife and I use this device to keep our 'toys' nice and warm! Fill one with water based lubricant and keep a glass 'toy' in it! Nice, neat, convenient. Allows for uninterrupted fun! So, when the babies are done with the bottle...don't throw this useful device away."
1,Didn't work properly...,"As a first time mother to a preemie, I thought this would be a great thing to have. It was a trick to get the water measurements correct; for the first few weeks it was either too much or too little. After a while it would start to shut off by itself too soon so the bottle wasn't warm enough. After that it began to stay running and making the bottle too warm and scalding the warming plate; sometimes it would burn a hole through our bottle inserts. It also took quite a bit of room on our counter. When my son was 11 months old the button to start it (the little red button on the front) broke and it wouldn't work at all. When I tried to send it back to the company they sent it back w/in a week and told me my warranty had expired. Next time I'm buying the Munchkin!"
4,Nice item!,"First time mommy here and I bought this before my son was born and once he was her was so stressed out about how to warm the bottles etc. This did come in very handy but when the second child comes I will not use it. At times it would heat the bottle to HOT so use with caution and watch it (4oz nurser bottles/glass) the cooling area would come in handy with traveling overnight in Hotels, Camping when no refridgerator is handy or If you have a 2 story home...it will save you up and down the stairs. You must be deligent to refill the little water holders also or you are making another trip to the faucet. All in All this was a nice product and I don't regret having used it. It easied my mind since warming with a microwave was something I was told not to do. I know use the mic for warming! LOL"
4,"Once you figure it out, a really nice warmer","Like most of the other reviews state, it's getting the amount of water correct that's key to this warmer. Once we figured it out after a few days of experimenting, it works beautifully. I highly recommend experimenting with a bottle of formula or cow's milk before your baby comes home, though. The first few days were tough... waiting for a bottle to cool while the baby was screaming, or worse, having a still cold bottle when the warmer takes 10-15 minutes to restart after each use."
4,Great for a new mom,As a single parent I loved this product when I was getting up several times a night. It saved steps to the kitchen to heat a bottle. With this I used both the 4 oz Avent and Evenflo bottles.
1,Not safe,"All I have to say is mine caught on fire!! I only had it for about a month and one afternoon I heard a pop...when I checked her bottle I realized the bottle warmer was smoking and it was on fire inside. I sent it back and they sent me a new one, but I never used it. They never did get back to me regarding what happened to it. If you decide to use one just be careful!"
1,FIRE HAZARD!,I had this item for almost 3 months. One night my wife noticed that instead of the orange button lighting up the entire inside of the unit was turning orange. I realized that the item was on fire as soon as I started to smell melting plastic.The bottle warmer was really convenient and I hope that I was the only one to have this sort of issue. If I'm not The First Years should be putting out a product recall.
1,Absolutely awful warmer- a complete waste of money,"This product is a major piece of garbage. You will NEVER get your milk to the right temperature no matter how hard you try. It will either be cold or it will be scalding hot. Also it creates a smell that smells like burnt hair which is worrisome considering others who reviewed this product (at least 4 people) said that it catches on fire. We were using dr. browns 2 and 4 oz bottles and sometimes the 2 oz would be cold while the 4 oz would be way too hot. We always ended up using the tap to correct the temperature and it took forever. We just bought the dr browns delux bottle warmer and its AMAZING! It remembers how long it takes to warm any particular amount and you dont have to fill it up with water every time the way you do with this. Remove from your registry, return, or throw away if you have bought this product and go with the dr browns instead."
1,horrible,"This warmer is a piece of junk! I was using the platex ventaire &quot;natural shape&quot; 6oz bottles and it would heat the bottom so hot to the point it would burn you if you touched it and the rest of the bottle would still be cold. Plus the cooler does not do a very good job about keeping the bottles cold. Whatever you do, DO NOT BUY THIS!"
5,lifesaver,"This thing is a lifesaver for the price you get a high quality bottle warmer plus a cooler, I used this thing religiously with the last two kids and now with the third one on the way we decided it was time for a new one since we had borrowed ours to my cousin and never got it back. You can premix the bottles and put them in the cooler with the included ice pack and prefill the water measuring vials and when the baby wakes you up in the middle of the night there is no brain power involved you pour the water in place the bottle in and start it up and your ready to go no running around the kitchen or anything like that. We always kept ours on nightstand by the crib for easier access and to just make our lives easier in general."
1,New design is not like the original design!,"I bought this bottle warmer, because the previous model from the same company broke. When I got the new version of ""The First Years Night and Day Warmer System"", I was shocked on how short the electric cord was. I was also displeased with having to unplug it, in order, to turn it off. I am not happy with the new model. I would try a different brand, if you need a bottle warmer."
4,Great night-time helper,"Great product. I use it at nights. It is a lifesaver when my son wakes up and needs his expressed milk instantly. Having the chiller compartment saves me the trip to the refrigerator. Sometimes I forget the ice-pack and will use a ziploc bag with crushed ice as an alternate. As soon as I pop it in the chamber, by the time I am done changing him - it is ready to go. I agree the measuring water is confusing so I just check it periodically to ensure the bottle doesn't overheat. One thing to note is that it heats up glass bottles SUPER fast vs. the plastic bottles. So if you need speedy turnaround use the Evenflo glass bottles - they heat up in under 3 minutes!"
1,Already broken,We got this item as a registry gift and the front button to turn on the heating element stays on all the time. It never shuts off and the water will boil endlessly. Piece of junk; don't buy this item.
2,twin mom,"I received this as a present for my twin girls (7 weeks). We haven't used the cooler yet because they are waking up many more times in the night than once so we've moved a mini-fridge to their room. The warmer is nice, but you cannot warm one bottle after another. You have to sit and wait several minutes before it will let you warm another one. Also, the two little cups that you use to fill the warmer (it heats using steam) are pretty inconvenient. I'm always over filling them and spilling on the floor. Until we got the better warmer, it was pretty nice. But ... I'm looking forward to using it as a bottle cooler when my two girls are only waking up one time in the middle of the night - then we'll get rid of the mini-fridge."
2,Not the best,"I found this warmer to be a joke. Every time I heat the bottle for my baby, it is either too hot or more ofter not warm enough. If you want to re-heat the bottle to get it to the right temperature, you have to wait a few minutes, which is no help when your baby is screaming his lungs out. One good thing though, it works with any kind of a bottle."
5,Loved this product!,I used this product every night until my baby was 5 months and loved it! Would buy again...
2,Too hot and never cold...,"I agree that the temperatures this products warms bottles to are very inconsistent, but we also noticed that the icepack inside doesn't cool well as it touches very little of the bottles' surface area and also thaws rather quickly. After only a few hours we found the formula to be cool, but certainly not as cold as it would have been had it been stored in the fridge."
3,Does not fit Avent 9 oz. bottle,"Good concept, but failed to tell you that it does not fit the 9 oz. Avent bottles."
1,didnt like it,"The concept is good, but i just didnt like it. It made a lot of noise in the middle of the night when trying to heat it. Some of the water would squirt out around the sides while being steamed. The little contact lens holders were hard to adjust the right water level for 4 oz bottles. I just didnt like it, I threw mine out."
1,Horrible!,We bought this for warming milk at night.It is a hassle to measure water and put water in it in order to warm the milk.
2,"A great idea, but heating is too inconsistent","I loved the idea this product offers, especially for middle of the night bottle feedings. However, the reality for me - maybe it was the unit I had - was that we couldn't get a reliable standard of warmth to the bottle and ended up with milk that was just too hot or too cold (more hot than not). It was more unpredictable than using the microwave. I really worked at it to find a reliable method of warming bottles, but at the end just got rid of it. I ended up using a smaller portable unit that gave me better service. I'm happy to see that there are parents out there who got great service from this unit, but unfortunately it didn't work for me."
1,HATE HATE HATE,"My husband has had to use every ounce of self restraint not to throw this thing against the wall. He brings our son to work and as many water combinations as he has tried, it always heats the water to boiling. It takes long enough to do that and then you get stuck waiting for it to cool down."
4,Great bottle warmer,"This is a great bottle warmer. My son is now 2 months old and it's still working great. You do have to be careful how long you leave the bottle in it, but I've used other warmers and they're even worse. Other warmers take much longer to heat the bottles, and at least with this one you don't have to go downstairs in the middle of the night with a screaming baby waiting to be fed. A tip - check the bottle temperature a minute or two before the button pops."
2,Too much guesswork and usually overheats,"I'm on the site looking for an alternative bottle warmer because my wife and I, after four months of practice, still hasn't caught the hang of it. Never seems to be just the right amount of water and most often the bottles overheat. We then end up setting them in a bowl of cold water and testing repeatedly until they've cooled down enough. Don't know if the perfect warmer is out there, but this certainly isn't it and we plan to keep looking."
2,"nice idea, but needs work","After playing around with different amounts of water, I never could get the bottle warmed up just right. Very uneven heating occurred also, with the bottom being much too hot and the formula on top still ice cold. It ended up being much quicker to warm bottles with hot water. I have a hot water dispenser and it takes about 60 seconds of spinning the bottle around in a cup full of hot water to evenly heat it. I like the design concept of this product, I just could never get it to work right, even after following the manufacturer's instructions."
4,This Warmer Kicks Butt!!!,"I love this warmer!!! I had no problems figuring out how to use it, as some of the other reviewers have mentioned. I love the way it keeps the bottles cool AND warms them. I can keep the unit upstairs and not have to run downstairs each time my son needs a bottle. I like the nightlight feature so I can see what I'm doing without blinding myself. I also set it up with the babysitter and the water is premeasured for her to use. It's simple and easy."
3,Slightly disappointed,"I bought the bottle warmer due to the fact that i have a 2 story house and it would save me time running up and down the stairs to heat a bottle in the middle of the night.The warmer was working fine until my baby switched to 8 oz of formula and the wide advent bottles. The warmer doesn't heat the 8 oz bottles unless i use 1 1/2 caps of water. The 8 oz wide Advent bottles do not fit in the warmer.The warmer takes a lot of practice to figure out how much water to use to get the bottle to the right temperature. Other than that, I do think the warmer is a great idea."
2,Not the best option,"Though this warmer generally works okay, I've found that I'd much rather just warm a bottle the old-fashioned way -- by immersing it in a glass of hot water. Dipping & spinning the bottle in hot water heats it much faster, and you know exactly how warm it's getting. With the steam heater, it's hard to get the exact right amount of water in there to heat a certain-sized bottle correctly. I ended up installing an Instant Hot water faucet (search ...for ""instant hot""), and while you have to be careful not to curdle the milk with too hot--too soon, even slowly heating the milk this way takes only 1-2 minutes for 4 oz. That 3-4 minute difference (manufacturer claims 5 mins to warm with this warmer) is pretty important when you're holding a hungry baby."
5,a must have for 2 story homes,"we've got a 2 story and a 3 week old who wakes once or twice a night for formula. I couldn't live without this bottle cooler/warmer!True, you must remember to freeze the ice pack - but easy enough, since you've got to clean up the used bottles each morning (just carry them all down together!). And easy enough getting it all ready at night.Using it is a cinch, even in the dark. The amount of water/steam problem some other people have doesn't bother me - baby is fine with it as long as the chill is knocked off.I turn it on when I go into the room, then have time for a diaper change and the bottle's ready. PERFECTThis bottle warmer rocks!"
3,Convenient - but inconsistent,This is an extremely convenient product as far as keeping bottles cool and then heating them- we have this and the Avent bottle warmer - and have yet to use the Avent bottle warmer until now. The past three or four times we have heated bottles it has been totally inconsistent - WAY too hot for our baby to eat or too cold. We are following the directions and it seems to not be working just right. We will try the Avent one next and see how it compares.
1,So Disappointed,"When I first received this item, I loved it. It broke within 60 days of owning it. As other reviewers have noted, it was difficult in judging the water level. I also found sometimes the bottle was either too cold or too hot. Loved the concept, especially since we were living with my in-laws at the time. I hated to have to go into the kitchen at all hours of the night and morning. It was convenient to have in our room with us."
2,Don't Waste Your Money,"I bought this warmer when my middle daughter was born. I used it about 3 times when she was a baby. I put it away, and found it again when I was having my third child. I tried it again to see if I would like it, but ended up just getting up and going to the kitchen to my microwave to warm the bottles. This product does not heat the bottle consistently, and several times it made the bottle so hot I had to pour cold formula in the bottle just to cool it down. It also takes much longer than it says to heat up a bottle. I much prefer 30 seconds in the microwave than 2-3 minutes of waiting for this warmer to heat the bottle up. I know the ""experts"" do not recommend using a microwave to heat bottles, but if you just give the bottle a shake before serving to your little one, you shouldn't have a problem with burns. Anyway, you have to shake the bottle after using the bottle warmer, too."
3,"Good Idea, not so great implementation","I bought this product after coming home from the hospital and agree the temperature is very inconsistent. After 2am the one thing i need is consistency especially when i have a screaming, hungry newborn. I still use it sometimes but do find myself using the other methods (hot water, etc)......"
1,kenny's mom,"Safety first makes a very similar product with all the same features. The warmers are almost visually identical. My Saftey First warmer does not have any of the issues others have complained about with the first years warmer (overheating, underheating, ect.....)"
2,worked well at first,"I bought it, very excited that it would be able to heat bottles quickly, keep them cool, and I could do this all in the comfort of my own room, instead of trotting to the kitchen. It worked GREAT at first, but soon it stopped working so great. A week later, it was taking up to TEN minutes to heat a bottle, when at first it only took about two to three. To top it off, I was using Playtex vent aire bottles, and it melted the bottom!"
1,a waste of good money,"I had a premmie son on jan. 27, 2003. While he was in the hospital I went to buy some things to help me cope with the extra wakings from his health problems. This is one of the products that I bought. It was worthless sometimes it didn't heat the bottles and sometimes they were to hot. the messuring cups were hard to use and munuver. I would not recomend this product to anyone."
1,Not Worth Buying,"I had purchased a Playskool nightime feeder at a garage sale and it worked awesome, only problem was that the ice pack was missing and I had a hard time finding a new one to fit. I decided to buy a brand new nightime feeder and purchased this one by The First Years --- MISTAKE!!! My 4oz. Dr.Browns bottles would not warm up at all. Unfortunately I found this out in the middle of the night with a very hungry baby. Thank god I didn't throw out my other warmer. Now I'm back using that one and The First Years one is going back tomorrow!"
3,Not consistent and no longer works after 5 months...,"We bought this warmer shortly after starting our son on bottles when he was about 1 month old. We loved the convenience of having the bottle kept cool at night and just popping it in to warm when the little guy woke up. I say we loved this product, until this morning when it decided to stop working. Our son is just 6 months so he is still on bottles and we have come to rely on this to quickly warm up the bottles (we make them in advance and keep them in the fridge). We bought another warmer this afternoon - not this one though. I also have to agree with the other reviewers that this product is not very consistent. We stopped relying on the water level to warm the bottle properly and would check the bottle often while it was warming - otherwise it would get too hot or not warm enough."
4,Pleased with bottle warmer,"My husband and I have found this bottle warmer to be very effective and work great for our needs. We use the Avent bottles and have had great success with this product for heating them up. It heats them evenly, unlike the microwave. We noticed that it's important to read the instructions thoroughly before using it. It's also important to keep the heating chamber cleaned out and free of water deposits. This caused ours to under-heat the bottles. It took a little getting used to in order to understand how much water to use for what size bottle we're trying to heat, but over all we like it and we've gotten a lot of use out of our bottle warmer."
1,Disappointed,"We have had this warmer for two week now and will be returning it shortly. It does not heat evenly and I find myself using the faucet to correct the overheating or underheating. I am hoping to find a better product. The only good feature is the cooling part for the evening bottles, however a lunch bag and two ice packs would work as well. Consider other alternatives before purchasing this product."
3,"Heats inconsistently, but cooler is a great idea","The cooler is wonderful. But it appears this bottle warmer and all the others on this website have the same problem...you have to figure out how much water to pour into the holder to heat the bottle enough. Most of my 4oz bottles come out too cold and since the auto-shutoff refuses to let me turn it on again until MANY minutes later, I end up having to run to the sink to warm the bottle under the tap. The instructions never mentioned that you can't turn on the unit again until it cools down. There is no way to put the bottle back in the warmer & just give it a few more minutes. It's useful when you get lucky enough to figure out how much water to use based on how cold your bottle is!"
1,Crap,This thing stinks. The on off switch never worked so we always had to plug and unplug it. Plus you can easily over heat your bottles in this. We did like the cooler on the back for travel but overall this thing stinks
1,inconsistent heating,"I tried to use this bottle warmer for three days with my MAM wide mouth bottles. Using the prescribed amount of water for breast milk and wide mouth bottles, I ended up with different results each time -- some times too cold, some times too hot, and only once just right. We ended up just running the bottles under hot tap water because this ended up taking less time and was more reliable than using this bottle warmer :-("
4,Great item for nightstand,"I purchased this to use on the nightstand or for keeping breast milk out. Unfortunately I ended up having to feel formula, so I used this as a bedside bottle keeper at night. Two bottle fit in a cooler compartment and one fits in the warmer. I had absolutely no issues with this item, did what it said."
2,Doesn't work as advertised,"Ehh, I bought this product to avoid my MIL using the microwave to heat bottles. The thing is that it really depends on the amount of milk and size of bottle. The warmer starts right away and creates a lot of steam. What i found is that a cold bottle from fridge would heat up a lot on the outside but a couple shakes and it would still be cold. I didnt find it evenly heated it through.Its still best to just sit it in hot water for a couple mins. :)But we will use this to keep cool bottles in the freezer pack in the back (remember to freeze the ice pack)-Overall, save your money and use the traditional method."
2,Upset,"I loved this product from the moment I got it. It works wonders with drop ins, And Avent bottles fit into and heat up nicely.... Sometimes that is. We have been using this with ourDr. Brown's Formula Mixing Pitcherand it was a life saver for awhile. Now All i can smell on our bottles is burnt milk from the heating plate.... Now I am not quite sure how the milk could possibly be getting onto it but it does apparently. We have been using it for about 3 months now almost every day, four- five times a day a most and it has considerably started to take longer and longer to heat up.. Before it was done and cooled off by the time the diaper change was over. Now we find ourselves sitting and waiting another minute or two for it to finish. The instructions are basically nonexistent. All in all it still works but I can slowly start to see it go down hill in its heating capabilities."
4,Use this everyday,"Seriously, this product is not bad. Read the directions and use some practice times before you set it up for night use. I use it everynight in my daughters upstairs bedroom. It saves running downstairs for a bottle or having her cry through the house as I take her downstairs. The lids on the water holders are snug as to hold the water in. As long as you get the bottle warming THEN pick up your baby then you're fine. The warmer will warm a bottle different each time depending on when you made it, i.e. has it been in the fridge for 1 hour or 6 hours? It will be colder the longer it has been in the fridge thus not warming the same as a bottle just made an hour ago. As I said, practice a bit to find what works and it's a good product to use. Also, do not heat bottles with the nipples etc. on, leave the bottle top open. And if you use the Dr. Browns the 80z DO fit in it you just can not have a cap on it in the cold area. I use this everyday and it works great for me."
4,Good after you get used to it,"I really appreciate this warmer during the night when I don't want to get up to go to the fridge, possibly having to turn a light on, to get a bottle while the kid is screaming, then still have to warm it while the kid is still screaming. You do have to play around with the water amounts, but my child doesn't have to have it ""just right,"" he only wants the coldness edge taken off. I've never had it warm a bottle too much, actually. I do find that it is somewhat inconsistent. Just make sure to check the temp before giving a bottle to the baby."
2,mixed review,"I agree that the water holder is a bit tedious to fill and measure acurately. I always follow the measuring instructions, but sometimes the bottle is too cool or too hot, even though I have been practicing to get it right. I wish it were more accurate and for someone like me, who only has a 3 room apartment, the cooling feature is not that useful."
2,No go.,"Twista always lays it down vocally.And a couple other rappers show potential too. But this cd is very sloppy. I found a lotta skippers on it. Due to irritating beats an chorus's. Twenty eight tracks, and I only fully liked about three. Unless your dying for new Twista flows, you should wait for his solo. Wich I hope will be at the same status as his prior efforts on Adrenaline rush."
3,Alright.,"This album has it's share of high spots, but is brought down drastically by the vast overabundance of unneeded skits. 8 skits on one album? That's getting ridiculous. Twista himself is only on 9 of the 20 actual tracks, and as expected, he turns in the album's best performances. Other noteworthy tracks by the Darkside Ballaz and High Beam also help the album's cause.The best point on the album comes on ""Stories,"" on which Twista and former No Limit soldier Fiend both drop hot verses. Other good tracks include ""Ball Wit Us,"" ""Run,"" and ""Peace Of Mind.""The album could've benefitted infinitely from some Traxster production, but overall the beats are mostly solid. While this is slightly better than the first installment, it's not a great album by any means. If you're a fan of Twista, however, you should enjoy it."
2,Legit iz some $h**,"I must have heard a different album, because this album was weak. I listened to it tha otha day and was glad that my partner bought it instead of me. There was about two songs that I liked so therefore I gave it two stars. Just like his boys Do or Die's ""Victory"", Twista's ""Legit Ballin"" falls way short of their abilities. I'm not tha biggest Twista fan, but I give him his props when they are due. I advise that you listen before you buy so that you want make tha same mistake as my partner did. I end this review by saying "" Legit iz some $h** and BONE iz tha...; Much Luv to OUR ORIGINAL FLOW FATHERS. BONE THUGS FOREVER"
4,Twista is back,"I do have to agree that Twista is the most underrated rapper there is out there. He is amazing with his style and it has been about a year since his last CD. ""New Testament 2K"" is much improved off of Legit Ballin Vol. 1. Twista is more frequent in the songs and the beats have stepped up. I liked to see that Liffy Stokes was in this album, one of the original Speedknot Mobstaz, but was disappointed that Mayze wasn't in it. This CD is as good as his ""Adrenaline Rush"" CD and his ""Mobstability"" CD. Guaranteed if you buy this CD you will be satisfied and anxious to get his next one."
4,"LIFFY STOKES OF ""SPEEDKNOT MOBSTAZ"" SHINES LIKE ICE ....","THIS ALBUM IS NOT IN THE CLASSIC SECTION.IT'S GOOD AND ALL MAYBE BETTER THAN VOL.1.THE BEATS ARE ALOT BETTER IN THIS ALBUM ""STREET SCRIPTURES"".ONE THING THAT I DON'T LIKE ABOUT THIS ALBUM IS THAT MAZE OF THE ""SPEEDKNOT MOBSTAZ"" ISN'T SAID OR HEARD AT ALL.INSTEAD THEY PULLED 2 LEGIT BALLIN MEMBERS AND MADE THEM THE ""MOBSTA-ELITE"".THEM 2 NEW MO-ELITES ARE , TURTLE BANXX , TOD NITTY .LIFFY STOKES OF THE SPEEDKNOT MOBSTAZ IS ON FIRE IN THIS ALBUM,HE SHINES LIKE PLATINUM HE SHOWS HIS TALENT MORE THAN ANY OTHER LEGIT BALLA.TWISTA IS HEAR ALOT MORE,IN THE LAST ALBUM VOL.1 TWISTA WAS NOT HEARD AS MUCH.NOW IN THIS ALBUM HE'S IN OVER 5 TRACKS.IN THE LAST ABUM HE WAS IN AT LEAST 3-5.MY FAVORITE TRACKS ARE MOST LIKELY #9 ""BALL WIT US"" & #26 ""HE LAYS"" . THIS ALBUM IS WORTH BUYING,BUT REMEMBER IT IS DIFFERENT THAN THE FIRST LEGIT BALLIN. WWW.LEGITBALLINRECORDS.COMTHA LEGIT BALLIN FAMILY 2001WEEEEEE STRAIGHT !!!"
3,Its time to play the game...,"This one's got plenty of body-slammin WWF Action. Much like the PS1, Smackdown's roster is starting to age a bit. The Create A Wrestler mode is decent, though, allowing you to add wrestlers who may not have come along until SD2. Voiceovers would certainly pick the game up. But for twenty bucks(or less, if used), this one will give you that steel chair fix anytime you crave it."
2,Not as good as the sequel,"This game really isn't as good as WWF Smackdown!2, but I think that it has 2 things in it that should of been carried over to the sequel. One, You can Re-name your finishing move so it sounds cooler, like if your name is Jack, You can do the Jackcold Stunner instead of Stonecold, the other, in this version you can see the move names as you do them, it was really helpful when I had a Backyard Wrestling Federation, it made choreographing the matches easier."
4,It rules!!,"WWF Smackdown is a terrific wrestling game and i love it. The problems are that it has such limited moves and options in the wrestler feature.My wrestler is Slash and hes unstoppable.THQ could have added secert chararcters like HBK,Jerry Lawler,Jim Ross,and Pat Patterson&Gerry Brisco.The moves should look more powerful because in Wrestlemania 2000 it looked liked the powerslam looked powerful.Either way its a topnotch title and any WWF fan should buy it."
3,One brilliant GAME,"this game is just electrifying, you can be a special guestref! what more do i need to say. You can walk around backstage and makealliances and break them. Brillant. This is a must buy for all wrestling fans I will be buying it, will you? END"
2,Laying The SmackDown On This Game!,"First of all...many game reviewers were making this game out to be the best WWF game to come out.But i think they are wrong!When i first played this game i was kinda excited,but after a couple of minutes of me playing it.I really got let down by the game play of this game!The only thing thats okay is the entrance themes and the video titantrons but thats about all.And another thing that is disappointing about this game is,the lack of wrestlers!And they keep adding the same wrestlers,they dint add new ones like too cool or grand master sexy!Which was a let down!So anyway...if you really want a wrestling game,get Wrestlemania 2000.Now thats a game that won't let you down like Smack Down!But in the end i feel like ""Laying The Smack Down"" on this game!¡!"
3,Stinks,Its old. Graphics are icky. Controls sloppy. Sounds like nails on a chalkboard. Storyline old. Characters old. It's old. Avoid Smackdown 1 and 2.
4,"""You are able to create so and so""?",I am going to skip the obvious pros and go right to the cons. Even on normal mode the computer reverses almost everything! When you complete one year in the season mode you get to create someone.......yippe! Why didn't they just give them to you? grrrrr. Some people list the incomplete ring entrances as a con but .... they're not really that important anyway! Too many unneccessary characters (Paul Bearer? puhleeeaze!) Most people complain about CAW but this is a new engine so it's not perfect....well far from it. The coolest part of this is like you can make your superstar sexy even if he looks like Paul Bearer in a thong LOL :) Well I think I've just killed about as many brain cells here as a half hour of MTV (which rules! Especially Tom Green!) so go about your lives and play lots of wrestling games!
4,You like pie...?,"This is by far the best wrestling game that has hit the playsation ever, with new and innovative modes such as the special referee and i quit matches. BUT there are several flaws. I couldnt wait to get my hands on this game for the storylines, but after playing it for days all i got to say was thanks or shut up! I havent had the chance to join DX or feud with Stone Cold like I was promised. Another downer is the create a wrestler, THQ had it perfected with Wrestlemani 2k, then decided that instead of creating our own characters, we'd want robots and monsters instead. Dont get me wrong, I love this game, but it could have been even better had THQ asked REAL wrestling fans what they wanted"
4,IF YA SMELLLLL......,"Finally Playstation has a WWF game to be proud of! Smackdown can easily compare to N64's Wrestlemania 2000. Its high flying, fast paced, and beyond the limits of fun. All wrestlers have been completey personalized to be as realistic as ever. Their looks, moves, and entrances will make you feel like your actually watching Smackdown every time you play! The few faults are these: Create a wrestler mode leaves a lot to be desired, you can't actually play with the hidden characters, and there is no HBK! All in all, especially compared to the past WWF games for Playstation....Smackdown is just plain GREAT!"
2,Not that great,"Don't buy it until you rent it! This game may be great for kids who want simple moves that don't require any effort and don't want much in a game, but don't expect anything fancy. If I would have rented this first I would have never bought it. After 2 days of playing it you will probably never play it again."
2,"Decent, but WAY over hyped","THE GOOD: The graphics are great, and all the backstage possibilities are alot of fun.The BAD: Where to start........I bought the game after hearing all the hype about ""storylines."" No go. The storylines are somewhere between pointless and non-existant. The create a character option is really bad. The game play itself is nowhere near as cool as WM2K for N64. And why are there no voices?ALL in ALL: I bought this game because I thought it was supposed to be better than WM2K. It's not worth it. RENT IT FIRST!"
3,Not the best,"There r much better games then this but i liek it though. I saw sevral problum and tht is,is tht the story line is so short and also u only have a small amount of moves. U have ur Speical and ur regular moves. U press O then right,left,up,and down. ADn when u run. But other then tht its a cool game. They have cool matchs and some cool action."
2,"GOOD FOR ITS TIME, BUT NOT TODAY","THIS WAS THE FIRST OF THE SMACKDOWN GAMES. WHILE IT WAS VERY FUN TO PLAY WHEN IT WAS FIRST RELEASED, THIS GAME IS ALMOST UNPLAYABLE TODAY! BEING THAT WE GOT MUCH FASTER GAMES LIKE SMACKDOWN; SHUT YOUR MOUTH AND SMACKDOWN; HERE COMES THE PAIN. THE GAMEPLAY IS ACTUALLY VERY SLOW [WHICH IS SOMETHING I'VE BEGAN NOTICING RECENTLY] THE CONTROLS AREN'T AS ADVANCED AS THE LATER GAMES ARE, AND YOU'LL JUST BE WASTING MONEY BUYING THIS GAME WHEN YOU CAN GET ONE OF THE MORE RECENT SMACKDOWN GAMES. DON'T PICK THIS ONE UP NOW. IT ALREADY SEEMS DATED AND POINTLESS NOW."
1,WWF Smackdown Really Sucks,"This game is really terrible. The graphics are extremely choppy and the frame rate is awful. The game seems to skip animation frames constantly. Also, there is no sound from the wrestlers in the game or when you hit the other wrestler. The storyline mode is a big waste of time and is really boring. The create a wrestler is also difficult and not much fun. Overall, the game is really terrible and plays as bad as Nitro and Thunder did. Buy Wrestlemania 2000 for the N64 instead. It is a much better game."
2,this game is not very good,"I really didn't like this game much at all. i thought the graphicss were terrible and the storylines were stupid and pointless. if you want a good game, buy Wrestlemania 2000."
3,Where are the others? /,I find it a great game but i'm so stressed that you can't get the amazing rikishi or tazz and most of all TOO COOL !if anyone knows anything about it then please write please!
4,A few flaws don't mar a great game,"This is a great game. The gameplay is a lot of fun and that's the most important thing. Sure the create a wrestler is very limited, with not many appearances, no ability to tweak the appearances, and a somewhat limited move selection. And the storyline mode is somewhat limited, but sometimes a lot of fun. Unfortunately, the WWF has gotten a lot of great wrestlers in recent months, none of whom made the game. No Tazz, no Radicals, that's understandable. But where are Rikishi and Kurt Angle who've been around for months? Where are Too Cool who were in WM2000 and even Attitude? Where's Crash Holly? He's in Hardcore's entrance video, but he's not in the game? Let me be clear. Great game. It's just not perfect, and no game ever will be. There will always be something that can be done better. Hopefully the next game will make some big improvements, so we can find new things to complain about."
4,A very good game,I have this game and i think it is very good. The gameplay is awesome and i think you should buy it. But know this smackdown 2 is gonna be a whole lot better.
5,The best wrestling game yet!,"I bought smackdown! the 2nd day it was out, and I have not stopped playing it since. It is a great game, and the graphics are awsome. Any body that buys this game will love it, I think it is a great game and a game worth whatever you pay for it!"
2,The TRUTH about Smackdown,"This game definately has some high spots. You can be the Ref for the first time. The graphics are great. The fighting is smooth. If you want a mortal kombat style game, this is probably great for you. If you want a wrestling game packed with moves, forget it. After a day or so, you realize all the flaws. The major problem is that the game play itself stinks for a wrestling game. Games are susposed to be easy to learn, but this is to simple for long term fun. It's the same few moves over and over. Kick, punch, suplex, repeat. You learn a hand full of moves and thats it, your done. Theres nothing to master and learn over time. The number of moves is very limited. The Create a wrestler is terrible. The game over all is difficult to opperate. Its a lot of loading time just to set up the most simple match. The options are confusing also. This is a great game to rent, but a terible game to buy because you'll be bored fast."
3,WWF SMACKDOWN - THE EASY WAY TO WIN MATCHES,"After spending way too manys nights playing this game instead of sleeping with my anti-playstation wife, I have discovered the best move to conquer any type of match on the game. Give your created player the bear hug as a move. Believe it or not, it will take down every friend or foe with ease. It might not be too exciting but to move your man and/or woman up the ranks and win titles its the best. This game has pushed the bar up to another level and I look forward to anyone topping this one for a while. WWF continues to push the right buttons to maintain a strong chokehold on the competition!"
5,WWF went all out,"The possibilities are endless. You can fight in the back, do any move, create-a-player, fight for titles, create a pay-per-view, or start a career. With so many wrestlers you could be up all night ploting story line after story line!"
5,wwf smack down is the great one of playstation.,i tried smack down just today i loved it it was i think the best wwf game they ever made so far the grafics are the best part about it and what comes on the titantron all i am saying that wwf smack down is the best game in the world unless wwf come out with a new one but it will be hard to beat this one and im glad it's named after what the rock does best LAY TH SMACK DOWN!
4,A pearl with a flaw,"When I first got Smackdown, i was ecstatic. I have played WrestleMania2000 and it was very good. Smackdown will be a challenge for those of you hooked on Attitude (like me), because the controls are different and THQ did a better job of polishing the game. After you play for 3-5 days, you should be able to win constantly on easy difficulty. The entrances a completely blew me away. I believe that, due to a let down in create-a-wrestler mode, the graphics and entrances are this game's saving grace. It's a good game to play with your friends or bring to a party, and pre-season mode is ingenious."
4,Smackdown put the Smackdown on me!,"The newest wrestling game from the WWF, ""Smackdown"" is by far one of the better games out there. I own two other WWF wrestling games, and those two pale by far compared with this latest addition. The graphics are way better than the rinky dink Wrestlemania 2000. The enterance songs and videos are awesome, and the moves are actually easier to master than past games. You do not have to run out and buy expensive cheat guides to master the basics of the game. Almost all of the wrestlers are accounted for on this game (except for the few newer wrestlers on the show...but when the game was being created those superstars were not around or just coming out.) The only down side is that the backstage plot lines are almost non-existant. But the anywhere matches doubly make up for that. All and all...Smackdown is a great game and a good value! If you don't have it then you are missing out!"
3,WRESTLING TAKES A SMALL STEP WITH SMACKDOWN,"SmackDown is the best wrestling game to date with minor glitches that make an otherwise perfect game. First, there are only a few wepons at your disposal. But some wepons like the stretcher are a joy to have because you can move it around. More backstage areas would have been nice. And the season mode has the biggest problem, where are the voices? Why do care care if Stone Cold is making a rivialry with the Rock and I can't hear what they are saying? Also, the I Quit matches are impossible to finish, it takes a good 15 to 20 mins. And without a multi tap, special guest ref is almost pointless. The limited create-a-wrestler is to a minimal compared to Attitude a ECW. WrestleMania is still the king of the ring, and if THQ and Yukes know their role and ever make a wrestling game for Dreamcast, fix these problemes and I'll give it a 5."
2,Don't waste the money (Rent it first.),"This might be the most disappointed I've ever been with a game. Season mode, supposedly the greatest invention since the People's Elbow, is aimless. The backstage attacks never lead to anything; no grudge matches, no outside interference, nothing. Create-a-wrestler, usually a favorite of mine, is terrible. It isn't even close to the quality of even the original Warzone CAW. The matches often end in KOs rather than pinfalls. If you are looking for a great wrestling game, either go with WM2000, or wait for the next one."
5,Best Wrestling Game Ever,When I first heard of this game I thought it would be a crappy game like Warzone and Attitude. But when I got it it was way better. The special referee matchs are great where another player or the computer controls a wrestler to be a referee. The entrances are really good with their titan tron videos in the back but they don't walk up the stairs and into the ring like Attitude. It is a great game but there should have been more wrestlers.
4,Great game but it does have slight flaws,"WWF Smackdown is a great game. It is consistantly fun. It has great graphics and great sound. I do have my pans of it though. The create a wrestler mode is really difficult to make some of the characters. Even the characters which are already pre made in the create a wrestler mode (specifically Ivory, Prince Albert and The Blue Meanie are really difficult to make actual costumes of) Also it will only let you make 4 characters per memory card. I also did not like the fact that in the create your own Pay per view section, you can not adjust the ring or the arena. However, you can store the entire game, with Options, create a wrestler, season mode and up to 10 created pay per views on one memory block. Sure it has its fault but what doesn't? It was a great game and I will give it 4 stars"
2,An Ok attempt to compete with THQ's N64 Wrestlers,"Smackdown was great in the aspect of a wide array of matches than any other Wrestling game. The actual gamplay was a little tacky, this is more of an arcade type wrestling game rather than simulation, moves way too fast. Creat-a-Wrestlers is really really poor, I mean, the way they designed the re-naming of the moves and all that was pretty cool but the look of a wrestler was simply bad. I think that if you are curious about the first installment of the smackdown series, rent this one, don't blow away money on it."
2,WWF: Smackdown,When this game first came out it was the talk of every WWE fan. But now it just plainly stinks. I would not recommend buying this as it has no point anymore. More than half the superstars in it aren't in WWE anymore.
1,It did not work for my baby at all,I got the Nature's Lullaby Player because of all the good reviews it received. I was very disappointed when it did nothing for my son. It did not sooth my son at all. It is such a waste of money!
3,eats batteries,I recieved this as a gift with my first child and the batteries lasted 2 days! I returned it. They really need a product that you can plug in.
3,battery hog,"I purchased this product for my son to sleep better, but after realizing that there was no power cord, I wish I didn't buy it. I changed batteries weekly. Plus, he figured out how to open the cover and would play with it all the time. It worked out great and I would recomend it for newborns, but when they start standing up in the crib, they will figure out how to open it."
4,This works great!,"I must say that our 5 week old loves the ocean waves. We put her to sleep with it every night! (all through the night after feedings too!) We have used the timer setting so that it will turn off after about 15 minutes, which helps save the batteries a little.The negative about this player is that it uses an abundance of batteries! We have rechargable batteries and have to recharge them almost every 3 to 4 days. This would be 5 stars if it was able to be plugged in to an outlet!"
2,"poor volume control, hard to get the batteries in and out","We have been using this player for our baby for about 4 months now. I find that the batteries start to lose steam very quickly, making the noises scratchy. the volume control is also very sensitive and goes from super loud to off with a miniscule turn of the dial.The batteries are hard to get in and out. The piece that mounts to the crib blocks the battery cover, so you have to put your screwdriver in at an angle, which is beginning to strip the screws.I am going to purchase the Dex model that plugs in. A friend uses it and has had none of the issues I have had."
3,Didn't work for my baby.,"The first few nights I used the heartbeat and thought it was doing a pretty good job of keeping my baby asleep and happy, but it didn't last long. Now I use a lullaby CD which he loves. I can sing along and he's asleep by the fourth song."
2,On my 3rd one....,"The sounds and features are great on this player - if you can get it to work (which I've had trouble with) AND if you can get the batteries to last longer than 2 days. Seriously, this eats batteries - so either invest in the rechargeable kind or buy the mega-pack of double AA's."
5,Exellent for a baby that won't sleep,"This is the only thing that helps my baby go to sleep. She is 6 weeks old and at 1 week she cried a lot and would never take a pacifier. This is so soothing for her, it works like magic! It does go through batteries but it is definitely worth it!"
3,Great item but needs AC capability!!!,"Great item but is hard on batteries (4 AA). An AC adapter would be a great accessory if it can be made safe for the baby. I read where someone couldn't find out how to change the batteries - for others in the same situation - remove unit from crib, place fingers under back part Grasp the back with your palm. Press hard on the center with your fingers while pulling dowmward. It is difficult but does come off allowing you to get to the battery compartment."
3,Love - Hate Relationship...,"I loved this item BUT the batteries were ALWAYS dying. This thing just sucks the life out of batteries like you wouldn't imagine. It is a great idea and my son loved it, but do NOT plan to use it the whole night or many nights or you will find it dead in the morning."
3,"Good product, just not necessary.","It seemed like a good idea. So did the Fisher Price Aquarium. But in truth, we've tried them, but we don't use them. The humidifier in our baby's room (and you definitely need one of those) makes great white noise, and that's what our baby likes. Every baby is different, but this product just didn't do it for us. It EATS batteries also."
4,Much needed,"We have really enjoyed having this since my son was born. We do not use the heartbeat or music setting, but he seems to like the other two settings which are more 'nature oriented.' I love the automatic shut-off and the voice-activated modes.We have gone through one set of batteries already, but it took seven weeks to do so. (That includes a few nights/naps that I forgot to press the automatic shut-off) Overall this is a great product and very useful."
2,First return from my baby shower,"This product was not was I expected. It didn't fit on the side of my crib, the sounds were not at all nice, and the voice activation required the baby to be almost screaming in order for it to turn on. So far this is the only thing I have had to return."
4,we liked it,"We got this from a friend who used it with her baby. We used it a lot when our daughter was younger and couldn't really play on her own. She liked the music, and sort of like the ocean and rain sounds, but didn't really care for the heartbeat. The nightlight doesn't really do much at all. It's not bright enough to see anything. The batteries are hard to get to, to change out. When our batteries needed replaced, we just stopped using it because our daughter had gotten to where she could occupy herself anyway. Overall, it's pretty good."
3,Ate up my batteries...,"I am now on my third Lullaby Player - the other 2 ate up my batteries (a full set of batteries lasting less than 3 weeks) and, even after changing them, didn't work eventually. I had trouble turning the unit off once my son was asleep (to try and conserve that battery power), but to no avail.I really love the sounds - especially the ocean waves - and my son did too; however, my new unit is not even yet on the crib - I haven't loaded the new batteries yet. :)"
4,"Great, except for the batteries","It gets my baby through the rough spots of the night where she almost wakes up, but the sounds lull her back to sleep. The only frustrating thing is that it eats up the batteries so quickly.We had to replace the batteries after only 3 nights. The second set of batteries lasted almost 2 weeks. It is difficult to replace the batteries."
2,buy stock in batteries!!!,"This product is a great idea, but we have to replace batteries every 3 days (keep it on from 7:30pm-7:30am). There is a 15 minute feature, but my baby wakes up when it goes off. Wish it had an adapter...Looking into the Fisher Price Aquarium since I heard it only needs batteries every few months when left on all the time."
1,Not Impressive,Someone bought this for our daughter. We tired using it but it went through batteries so quickly. And it just wasn't what we were looking for. Check out the mommy bear if you want something that soothes your baby to sleep without using all the batteries in your house.
2,Good while it works!,Good while it worked! My baby really liked the sounds and the night light was great for midnight feedings. I only had it for three weeks when it stop working. I changed batteries thinking that was the problem but the next day it stop working again. It didn't play music and light would not turn off. I am really disappointed. Buyer beware!
1,A Waste of Money,The only good thing about this is the night light function. The waves and water sound horrible and my son never liked listening to the music or the heartbeat sound.
4,Soothing player,This sound machine has worked great for our son. He loves to listen to the ocean and the lullaby. The only reason I didn't give this player five stars is because it is so difficult to take the battery cover off and replace the batteries. There are two holders on the back of the sound machine to place it on the side of the crib and the battery compartment is underneath the holders. We started placing tape on the player to close the battery compartment instead of trying to screw the compartment on.
2,Waste of batteries,Whatever my baby may think about the sounds I don't know. The light is helpful. But the frequency of battery purchases makes this noisemaker a waste of money. Buy one that plugs into the wall. Oh yeah...the sounds are not that good either.
4,"Great product, but...","This is a great product, but more sound options would be nice (which is the only reason I gave it 4 stars). Other than that, the automatic shutoff feature is very nice. We keep this attached to our son's bassinet which is by our bed. The nightlight is absolutely perfect for checking on a sleeping baby (without waking anyone sleeping in the bed next to you). I havent had any problems with it eating up batteries at all."
3,extremely helpful but..........,"after reading the reviews i decided to purchase this for my 5 mth old son who was sleeping only 1 to 2 hours at a time at night. once my husband and i figured out that it must be street noise that was waking him (noises a fan could not block), we decided to try this product - a bonus was that it attaches to the crib. it worked great - my son is sleeping for 4 + hours at a time. it does eat batteries - especially being run all night. we tried rechargable batteries, but those were drained in hours. we decided to return this product and we purchased an actual white noise machine by marpac. it plugs in, and is small enough to be close to the crib and loud enough to effectively block street noise. another drawback to this product is that the sounds are not that great of quality - especially the lullabies. the rain is the only tolerable sound and it just sounds like static. if you have a problem sleeper, invest in a real white noise machine that plugs in."
3,Less is More,"I bought this thinking the voice activating feature would wean my daughter from the pacifier so I wouldn't have to get up at night to put it back in. The sounds are nice- she seemed to like the ocean the best. I never ended up using the voice activating feature because she had to REALLY make a noise for it to go off- which means she is really crying and worked up. So we kept it on all night- however it went through batteries way too fast. The night light feature is nice but it is hard to find the button for it when it is pitch black in the room. Sooo I guess you could say we are getting rid of all our gadgets (sleep positioners, sound machines, aquarium crib toy and even pacifiers) until she learns to soothe herself to sleep. It is day 2 and we've had some crying but she is helping herself! If you need to buy one get one that you can plug in. Just my advice- would I buy it again?.....nope!"
4,Not bad....,I got this for my second daughter instead of the womb bear. I do like that you can choose different sounds and the night light feature is also nice-wish it worked while the sounds were running. The only complaint I have is that after a while it started to sound staticky(sp?)but exchanged it and have had no problems. Worth the money.
4,"We love it, except...","This lullaby player is wonderful. Our baby is 4 1/2 months, and we've had to go into her room several times/night to replace her pacifier for 4 months(didn't have the heart to let her cry it out). The lullaby player has helped us in teaching her to go to sleep on her own. She no longer has a pacifier in her crib. I wanted to use the rainfall or ocean sounds for white noise, but it turned out our baby liked the lullaby setting better.The voice activiation is why I bought it and why it works so well. We rarely go into her room at night now, because as soon as she cries, the player turns on.The only bad thing is a really bad thing. It just inhales the batteries. I assume it uses them so quick because it has to be on all night so the voice activation can be ready. But, we have to replace batteries AT LEAST one a week. This product would be perfect if it could be plugged in."
3,A little dated for 2011.,"This book is useful to the first-time geocacher and contains information that will be usefult to them. However, the book came out in 2004 and is a little dated for today's cacher. For example, it says that the GC codes used to identify geocaches are 6-characters long. They were in 2004, but by 2011 so many caches have been placed that the code has expanded to 7 characters. Also, the focus on electronic devices include only PDAs and Pocket PCs. There is absolutly no information on Smart Phones. I think it's about time for the author to come out with a revision for this book."
5,Informational,Chock full of information. I love the 'For Dummies' series. I own several different ones. It has great tips on how to place and to find caches.
2,Read the fine print...,"This is not a reissue of the ""In Your Face"" album released by Combat records around '84, but rather a set of tracks laid down before being properly mixed. The source tape is of low quality, probably from a cassette. There's a live disc included, which doesn't sound much better. The packaging is well done, but I'd put this release in the catagory of ""for collectors only""..."
5,SHE IS STILL HOT,"My father used to play PATTI all the time in the house, and he still does...and i thank him for it. This CD not only touched my heart, but it touched me deep down in my soul, Ms. Patti hit on some subjects I was feeling and took on indeed a timeless journey, that since getting the cd upon its release, i take that journey at least once a day. ""Something More"", ""Hear My Cry ft Floetry"", ""2 Steps Away"", ""Finally Got the Nerve"", and ""When You Smile"" are some of my favorites but the album in general is simply and truly amazing, awesome, off the chain, a collectors item SHO NUFF. So if you are a true music lover, you are wrong if you don't have this album in your collection."
5,"Like Usher Said On Vh1 Divas Live ""The Diva Of All Divas""","A new album, a new label, GREAT songs. A little R&B, a little Hip Hop, and patti's vocals, IT WORKS! Go on with your Diva Self, Patti girl, you got it going on. I love this album. My favorite favorite song on this album is A New Day, I'm just coming out of a tough time in my life, and when I first heard this song, I heard the dance version on spiritofhouse.com which I have to say is absolutely amazing and will definitley be a club anthem, especially in the gay clubs. The song and the lyrics got me through that tough time. Thank you, Patti. Ms Labelle can do no wrong, don't think about getting the album, GET the album, you won't reqret it. Every Patti album is always better than the next, it's no wonder she has longevity in this business. Go on girl!! Work it Mama!! Now, Teena Marie is coming out with her new album May 11th, when is Ms Patti Labelle and Teena Marie going to do another duet together? Your No. 1 Fan in Las Vegas...."
2,Patti Labelle is great but the music on this cd isn't!,First of all Patti is an amazing talent who deserves a ton of credit and praise. First for her powerful voice and second for her tenure.The problem with this CD is that her voice is too low in the mix. The background singers are louder than Patti's voice on many of the song which is not good.The other problem is that only two songs on this CD are up tempo everything else is slow and laid back. Sure some of the slow songs are ok but most of them are dull.Patti sounds strong on some of these songs but on the other songs she doesn't project her voice enough and that is probably the fault of whoever arranged the songs.The first song and the last song with Sanatana are the best songs. A new day and a few others were good. The rest are boring.
2,Maybe It will grow on me...,But on fist listen Patti sounds off key way too often and the songs are very tired. Very disapointing.
3,Partly OK,"I ordered the charger and a rechargeable battery. The charger worked great, but the battery would not charge. Luckily, I ordered an extra battery which did charge, but I wanted another to have ready when one battery went low on power. I wanted to exchange the battery only, but was disappointed when I had to send both the battery and charger for a refund. No exchange could be given."
3,It worked,"The batter insert position was a little confusing, but once I had things lined up, this charger worked like a charm! Also had the opportunity to use the European adapter in Spain. It would not work for things like hair dryer or straightener, but for cell phones it worked great!"
1,DOESNT work with LI42 battery!,"This item does NOT work with the LI42 battery. I was in a hurry and going on a trip and didnt take time to read reviews as I should have. LI42 is not even mentioned on the package though it is in the title and description. Amazon needs to fix this. Luckily, I found my charger, but will more than likely not waste my time to return this junk."
1,Bad research,"This is an older book that I have only recently seen. As ith some other ""Osprey"" books, the research is way below standard. The list of factual errors in this book is way too long to even begin to list. As with other Osprey offerings, do NOT accept anything in this book as fact unless verified from another source!"
2,Not what I expected,"Play plastic money, and oversized bill in center was not what I expected. Returned and received a prompt refund. Great seller but should be more clear on listing as well as picture advertised"
2,Battery Life Unacceptable,"Just like every other review, the batteries suck but it works well when it works. Collar is much too stiff for the right fit on a small dog."
1,Don't judge a book by it's cover!,"Sure it looks cute... At first I thought it was me... because surely I can't have received 2 faulty receivers in a row. The first and second receivers were both faulty, (which PetSafe replaced quickly) but the positive (1st receiver) and negative (2nd receiver) button stuck on the ""on"" position on the inside of the receiver. The red LED light remains solid until it finally dies. I'm sure the collar itself works fine but I can't really say. My fingers are crossed that the 3rd receiver will work just fine. Amazon is great... the product is questionable."
1,DO NOT BUY,"100 YARDS RANGE, ON WHAT PLANET??? THIS IS A PIECE OF JUNK. I HAVE TRIED NEW BATTERIES, RESETTING,FOLLOWED ALL THE DIRECTIONS TO THE LETTER,I EVEN PUT IT ON ME. 30 FEET MAYBE IF I WAS LUCKY. I HOPE I CAN GET MY MONEY BACK, IF NOT IT WILL BE GOOD FOR TARGET PRACTICE."
1,"DON'T BUY THIS, you'll spend a fortune on batteries","The device itself works fine, but PetSafe have locked you into buying only their batteries, which are way overpriced.Don't be a sucker!"
1,"Beware, needs expensive batteries",Bought this and it did not work right. Called PetSafe and they did send a new collar. Good customer service. Beware this collar has a $11 to $12 dollar replacement battery and only last a month.
1,No battery life,"Like the product, but as stated in other reviews the battery life is nonexistent. The collar batteries will only last 4 hours or so before shutting down - unacceptable!When it worked, it did break our dachshund from his bad behavior but we don't want him to associate the corrections with the collar so we wanted to leave the collar on and make the corrections as needed. Bad behavior in a puppy comes unexpectedly and you have to be able to correct without taking time to catch the pup, turn on the unit, then wait for a reoccurrence of the bad behavior. Bottom line: I wouldn't buy another!"
1,Worked less than 2 weeks,"Stopped working within 2 weeks of purchase and never seemed to work right, as it had to be constantly reset by turning it off and on. Now it won't work at all, just beeps and blinks if turned on, even with a new battery the first week and only using it about 2 hours a day. Customer service at pet safe was awful, apparently didn't even read my email request for help as they sent me a ""solution"" for a problem I did not have. Even sent me the same solution again when I replied the first time that that was not my problem. Will be returning, but I am doubtful about seeing my money again."
3,Useful thing,Useful thing for my small dog - australian silky terier - however sometimes not reliable switch on. Sometimes it probably resets therefore it beeps without any signal from remote. So the dog is confused. Anyway when it is working correctly it is quite effective equipment.
1,Collar Not For Small Dogs,"Small dog owners beware! We have a Yorkie-Poo (currently about 8-9lb.s)and the design of this collar will not allow a proper fit. The collar is much to rigid and does not hang properly around her neck. It makes a circle instead of hanging loosely around the neck. Also, I would be concerned about the lifetime of a plastic dog collar. This collar is not as small as they make it out to be. The ultra-light collar with the red collar fits much better and is only a little larger than this collar."
3,Backyard Wiffle Ball,Very hard to hit the ball. Timing is very critical and on the small screen it is even harder. Fielding is hard as well because of the lack of depth perception. Great graphics and game modes. Would be an absolute blast if I could hit the ball.
5,Christmas Gift,"An awesome price when I purchased this game. I haven't played it, it was a gift for my nephew. I can't imagine it's anything but fun. Wiffle ball takes me back to the good ol' days when life was slow and easy. Fast shipping to go along with a great price. Thanks!"
1,junk!,"This binder lasted me about 6 hours. The design of the EZ open rings means they are held shut only by the tension of one latch on the bottom of the binder. Ergo, the top ring does not close tightly and pages get caught in it. Furthermore, this is no ""heavy duty"" binder...i dissected it after the top ring failed and it is no different in structure than the regular Avery binders. Bad deal all around."
2,Nothing new,"Even a casual fan of Fleetwood Mac's will not find any surprises in Leah Furman's biography, ""Rumours Exposed"". It's obvious Furman did not talk to anyone even remotely associated with FM, and she used readily accessable print/Web sources for the majority of her information. The writing is stop and go as well, as if this was a magazine article padded to book length, and Ms. Furman's style veers between rock-journalist pretension and gushy fan. Diehards may just want the book to add to their collection, but if you're less than that, just borrow it from your local public library."
1,Ugh...don't bother,"The book jacket says this is ""a veritable treasure trove of Fleetwood Mac lore"" and an ""essential volume"" to add to your collection if you're a Fleetwood fan. Insights? Untold stories? New info? Juicy details? Nope. You'll get the same quotes you've already read in the magazines, but sliced, diced, slapped together, and peppered with the author's maddeningly superficial and speculative judgments. Read the original magazine articles for the full quotes in their proper context, which provide you with far more well-rounded, fair, and informed views of each of these interesting, complex and talented people. This is decidedly unessential and not even a fun read if you actually like this band and all of its members."
1,I Could have written this book...,"Sorry guys, absolutley nothing new here: it's all rehashed from the same old published articles that everyone who's a fan has already read. Even the pictures add nothing exciting here. If you want a decent read of the group check out Mick Fleetwood's autobiography. And we can always look forward to the day when Stevie writes her own book..."
1,Don't waste your time,"Having read all of the other Fleetwood Mac books and hundreds of articles, etc., in my opinion this is an annoying and amateurish effort. Even Mick Fleetwood's book, which contains many inaccuracies and biases, isn't this skewed. Ms. Furman has strung together a lot of quotes, mostly out of context, and glued them together with her totally subjective opinion of what the speaker meant. How she was able to analyze and offer up opinions without having any personal contact with these people is a mystery to me. It's not ""unauthorized"" by accident - this book is a great disservice to Fleetwood Mac."
3,Clips Rehashed,"Based on no interviews with any of the principles, this rock bio expose uses clips from many contemporary newspaper and mag articles to build a story of how this '70s supergroup fared before, during and after its biggest moments surrounding the albums ""Fleetwood Mac"" and ""Rumours."" The usual romantic entanglements are recalled. You'll be quite sick of Lindsey Buckingham's self absorption. But you'll want to go back and re-listen to the great music, which is the real point of books like this anyway."
1,Ugh,"I definitely hated this book. I'm a huge Fleetwood Mac fan, and found had read all of the articles in the book before I read the book itself. I'd found them online... don't waste money, just do an online search!"
2,I want to write a book!,"If you are a great Fleetwood Mac fan like myself, than you probably have heard or read every article or story in this book . Basically it is a compilation of old articles, and if you think that a book published in 2000 should in some way shed light on the relationships of band members since 97', or perhaps tell us about Lindsey's marriage-please get us an advance and we will get to writing a book that achieves that! lol I'm just kidding, but it would be nice if there was a book written that had some inside sources, so that new stories can be relayed that give us a glimpse into who these people have evolved into now. It's just a thought, and I know that one day when Stevie writes her memoirs we may get what we have been waiting for all along!"
4,"Beautiful Song, Great Mixes","I just received this CD from Amazon.com. It was shipped the same day I ordered it. For my money, this song is better than ""Color your world"" or ""Mysterious Times"", the other Sash! tracks that are hot in the US. ""La Primavera"" is a much better follow up to ""Encore Un Fois"". The ""Radio Edit"" is terrific which starts with the sultry female vocals. The ""Dj Jam X & De Leon Remix"" has a nice build-up, but not the hook of the Radio Edit. The ""Magic Alec's"" mix is a faster dub version. The other mixes are quite good, and the sound quality of the CD is excellent."
5,Excellent Choice!,"The first bed I received had a defect. It didn't hold air. I was given a return authorization immediately by Amazon and received my new bed the very next day! Wow .. what service. I am so glad I chose to try again with the same product. I bought this air mattress for the occasional guest as my second bedroom is very small and I didn't want to sacrifice my sewing space. I set it up to see how it would fit and have been sleeping on it for the last month! It is very comfortable. I've had to pump additional air in it a couple of times, but that involves nothing more than flicking a switch. My queen sheets fit nicely and the height, although not as tall as a bed on frame, is just right. I don't feel like I'm sleeping on an air mattress at all. I highly recommend this product."
1,don't buy from backstore- they lie,"Backstore charged me $97 for expedited shipping and then did not ship expedited. Amazon failed to resolve this claim on my behalf. If you read enough of the seller reviews for Backstore you will see this is typical.I am sure they will post a clever reply, as they have to others who complain about their thievery."
4,camping review,"We purchased the intex air flow airbed to use on a camping trip. It was very comfortable, a great height so there were no issues getting off of it. The one negative I found was it lost some air during the night. This could have been due to possibly over filling it."
1,intex_dissapointment,"Bought this early this year, it was fine for first few use although we did not use it much may be 5-6 times this year for guests. Now the bed won't hold air. From the reviews I thought it is a reliable product but didn't turned out quite like that. Extremely disappointed."
2,Comfortable but unreliable,"Had to replace the first one due to a leak around the pump. The second has failed as well, and no replacement was recommended. If you get one that will hold air, you will probably enjoy it.No problem getting the first replacement, or refund on second. Amazon, gooooood. Mattress, baaaad"
4,Air Mattress,"I think the bed is comfortable and is great for guest. The height is good but you do have to add more air everynight before you sleep in it. I thought the sides would come up further to prevent you from rolling off, like it claims, but that is not the case. For the most part it was a good purchase compared to others in the same price range."
5,Great Bed!,"Seems like a great bed to me. Built in pump is very fast, holds air well, nice and raised (almost normal bed height). My only complaint is that I don't think its truly queen sized....it's a bit smaller. Probably more of a ""full"" than a ""queen"". Queen sheets were slightly loose on it."
4,Good Air Bed,"Bought this for our kids to use when guests visit. Worked like a charm. Not too high or unstable. Sheets fit and tuck in easily. Inflates easily. Loses a bit of air from one night to the next, so need to refill a little before going to bed each night. Very pleased with our purchase."
4,Intex Supreme Airbed,"Received airbed on scheduled date of arrival. We are very happy with the quality and comfort of this airbed. Great quality product. Hopefully this will last with no leaks. Great design to be able to tuck sheets in between mattress and lower air section of mattress. Convenient built in pump, fast.. Quality product. Would recommend this airbed."
2,Leaker,We had our 1 year before it became unusable because of a leak we could not find. It was a good bed until then.
1,Not just one but TWO were bad!,"When I first set up this bed, I absolutely loved it. Within 3 weeks a huge lump started to form right in the middle of it. Amazon was good enough to ship me a replacement at no cost. Within a month after I got the new one...the exact same thing happened. Plus it kept loosing air, and I found tiny little holes all over it. I ended up using the entire patch kit it came with. Thats when I threw it in the garbage.I can understand defects...but I it shouldn't have happened twice in a row. I do not recommend this bed to anyone."
5,Exellent Bed,"I bought this air mattress for my fiance and she really loves it. She has said it is better then them more expensive mattresses. We have no problems at all. I just let the air mattress get to room temp. Before I inflated it. We just add some air as needed it doesn't need air often. My fiance says she sleeps better on this air mattress then she did on her previous bed. She sleeps on it every night. She normally has back,shoulder,neck problems. But since sleeping on this air mattress has had no problem out of her back,shoulder, or neck."
5,Great buy,"I recieved one that had a hole in it, Amazon had one to me the very next day when I told them of my problem. The second has been in use for about a month as temorary bedding and I can only say good good things. I would suggest this to my friends."
5,Great bed - you can even tuck in the sheets!,"The first one we ordered leaked air, but Amazon.com sent a new one, overnight! This one is great, and really feels like a BED! My 88 year old mother slept on it for a week and loved it!"
4,the best ever,"this is he best ever air bed i have come across, it very firm to surport my back and it does not deflate by itself over time.Intex Supreme Air-Flow Queen Airbed Nylon Flocked with Built-in Electric Pump"
1,Works for about 3 weeks before it forms a mountain in the middle; leaks,"I used this one of these for 6 weeks, and I was the only guy who used it; I'm not overweight, either. It is comfortable for an airbed.Commonly reported problems:It lost quite a bit of air each day, so I had to run the pump for about a minute each time.Then, 3 weeks in, I noticed a small hump in the middle of the mattress; apparently, something had let go internally. It was a little uncomfortable to sleep on, so I shifted out of the way.Then, 6 weeks in, I awoke to hear (and feel) 2 pops inside the mattress, and than saw Mount Etna appear where just the hump had been previously.Luckily, I did not buy it here with the 30-day return policy, but from a large bricks and mortar store with a longer return window, so I got my money back.Intex does not guarantee the product, and obviously for good reasons. It's garbage, unless you want to buy one every other month. Avoid."
1,Great at first......but quality DOESN'T last,Intex Supreme Air-Flow Queen Airbed Nylon Flocked with Built-in Electric PumpWithin two months a bubble on top appeared....now it's only good as a single bedPoor quality and a magnificent 30 day warranty.....Now I know why.I am retired and need a cushion bed for my back. My last airbed (Aerobed) lasted for years.I switched to Intex because of being able to tuck in the sheets.....Poor meCaution ......Don't count on this bed for more than the 30 days they give you.
1,Deflated the FIRST TIME! Don't buy!,"This air mattress was busted from the start. Deflated the very first time we used it. Plus, since I ordered it a while ago, and just had it sitting in the box (fully sealed) until we happened to need it for guests, I can't even return it. Save your money. I'm going to attempt to contact the company for a refund."
5,Excellent bed for company. They used it for a week and said it felt like a regular bed.,"Over the Christmas holidays we had a full house, and the company that slept on this for over a week said it felt very comfortable. They did not get rolled around at all due to it's design, could sit easily on the side.It was VERY easy to inflate and deflate (with the pump that's right in the bed itself) which we did every day with ease.Another thing I REALLY liked about it was it's height off the floor. It's more than twice as thick as any other inflatable mattress I'd ever seen. It also has a very nice suede or nice material feel to it, and seems very well made and is very durable. It also comes with a good storage bag to keep it in.I can't think of one way to improve this product. Thanks everybody before me that rated this bed- you helped me pick an excellent product!!"
3,strong chemical smell but otherwise very nice,"after reading other user reviews, we made sure to air out this bed on the porch before using it. however, despite that, the bed gave off a very strong chemical odor. the odor was so bad that i moved my toddler out of the room it was in b/c i worried about it. we've used it several times since & it still stinks...other than that, it is a very well constructed sturdy comfortable bed."
2,leaks,"Worked well for a month. I have had this bed for a little over a month, and it just started to leak. I dont have animals or any sharp things on the bed, and woke up in the middle of the night on the floor. I cant find the leak, but hopefully i can exchange it."
3,intex airbed,"I purchased this bed about 6 months ago, because I couldn't really afford to buy an actual bed. I was kind of unsure how it would work out, but all of the reviews seemed to be positive, so I went ahead and bought it.It's actually really comfortable, and i liked that it kind of looks like a real mattress. But after a couple of months, I noticed that my bed was deflating. After about week I found the source of the leak - a small tear in one of the seams. I patched it up, and it was good as new until a couple of weeks ago when the same thing happened again. While I was patching it I noticed several other tears in the seam, and did my best to patch those too.I have a cat who sleeps in bed with me every night, and it can stand up to her claws. So, I'm really disappointed.Aside from the seams tearing, I think that this is a great product. I just wouldn't really recommend it for extended use."
1,DO NOT PURCHASE,"After only four uses, the built-in pump burned out and the manufacturer refused to back up the product in any manner whatsoever."
1,Never Will I buy an Intex Product again,"I did not buy my Intex Supreme Air-Flow Queen Airbed Nylon Flocked with Built-in Electric Pump from Amazon but I will never buy another Intex product ever again. I bought this product in June 2011, and by early July a small bulge or pop up came about at the end of the bed. I thought well maybe it was from the way I was laying. So that night I put the airbed back up and now there were two bulges/popup and the new one right in the middle looking like a watermelon! I emailed the company and all they told me was to speak with the store I bought it from and they hoped that this wouldnt lead me away from Intex brand. Well it has and I am completely disgusted with all of this. What a waste of $120.00"
2,"Ok Bed, but will leak","I have had 4 of these air mattresses and every single one of them has developed a leak. I can never find out where they are leaking from either, but sure enough halfway through the night I wake up sunk into the bed and have to get up and refill it. Other than that its a pretty good bed, I'd recommend getting a memory foam pad to go with it. I wont be buying another air mattress though."
2,Would not recommend,"This air mattress is okay, but it slowly loses air and deflates about 2++"" on a regular basis. I have tried two of them and same problem. I would not recommend it unless you do not mind a softer air mattress."
3,guest bed,"Purchased for used as occasional guest bed. Inflated for 5 nights and used for 3. I set it up 2 days early to ""air out"" as it does have a plastic smell. Our niece said she was comfortable and liked the bed. Seemed to loose a little air when slept on but overall works well. I did use a mattress pad to keep occupant warmer. Inflates quickly and pretty quietly. Takes awhile to get all air out but repackages nicely.Two years later (2012) I ended up giving this bed to Goodwill. It was in great condition, had only been used 3 times, two nights each. It developed a small leak somewhere... I could never find where the leak was originating from in order to repair it. The bed would sink during the night of use to where the person would be in a depression so not supporting back properly. The pump continued to work well, fitted sheet would tuck in nicely around top section, bed was a good height."
4,Air bed success,Bought this bed moving into a unfurnished vacatiion Apt. to use while renovating and then for extra bed when I furnished the place. It slept great. The vertical billows dont roll like the horizontal designs do. Woke up next to edge and had no sense of rolling off. A little more expensive than some but good for the money in the long run. It did loose a little air each night. I added 30 seconds of air each night depending on how firm you like it. But a good nights sleep here. Feels like a real bed if not better.
1,doesn't stay inflated...,"this bed does not stay inflated and is useless.if it would work, i bet it would be nice.do not buy unless you can get a refund or exchange"
2,Veronica,At first I though I would be a very good one. But after using for a while it shown to be not so good. It does not hold the air and every morning you have to pump air to be able to sleep at night. I returned the first one I purchased back to Amazon. I am very much impressed with Amazon customer service. They were as fast as it can be to send me a new air mattress to replace the first one I have purchased with them. Congratulations!Outstanding customer service!
5,Very nice...,Was surprised how well built this was. Definitely recommend it. Bought this for my sister visiting from Hawaii. Her husband and her loves it.
1,DO NOT BUY AN INTEX AIRBED!!!!!,"I purchased two INTEX airbeds. One in May 2012 and one in November 2012. Both beds stearted leaking around the air pump after two months. Neither Amazon or WINDY CITY would not help since the problem ocurred after 30 days. Intex is clearly selling an inferior product. What is worse Amazon is allowing it. Please read the reviews! The odds of you wasting your money are very high!To Amazon I can only say ""You should be ashamed of yourself!"" Not caring about your customers disappointments will catch up with you!"
4,Most comfortable Intex Airbed,"This is our 4th identical Intex Airbed during the past four years. We love the nylon flocking on the top and the 20 inch height. Corner bottom sheets fit well into the spaces. The price on this airbed has dropped considerably since our first one, and there is no longer any replacement warranty. If the bed is left inflated for weeks on end and is used daily it will develop leaks. I guess this is inevitable. Leaks are impossible to locate. When the bed starts to leak we order a new one. I guess the point is that this is not a substitute for a regular bed, but is great for guests and, if electricity is available, for camping. The built-in electric inflation pump works really well, and also quickly deflates the mattress. The carry bag could be a little bigger because it is nearly impossible to fold and compress the mattress as much as the original packing. Overall, we have been pretty happy with this product and will continue to purchase it as needed."
4,So Far So Good!,"I purchased this product as a temporary solution until my furniture catches up from my move. The reviews on this bed are either wonderful or awful. Well mine is good. I listened to some of the reviews and I filled it then let some air out of the bed. I left it overnight and then filled it the next day. It stayed filled with air and very comfortable, even after a little ""First Night Fun""I would definitely recommend this bed for a temporary solution."
1,Buyer Beware - NO WARRANTY,"I have been a supporter of Intex for a long time now.. I have purchased 3 of their inflatable beds and was happy with the first one. Then the second one started bowing in the middle and made the bed way too huge. Then, I bought a third one for a friend and within a month it started to lose air significantly.I called Intex for warranty and customer support. I found that Intex had NO WARRANTY on their inflatable beds ... so if you purchase one you better hope it is a great working product because if it is not, then you are SCREWED! Intex will do absolutely NOTHING about it!!!I am no longer a proponent of Intex and have vowed to make sure all customers know that they provide NO WARRANTY whatsoever.You have been warned!"
1,So much for quality,"Yep.... This air mattress tore along the seam after I used it for 3 weeks. I tried patching it ( had to buy a repair kit because the kit it comes with is WORTHLESS). I'm sure most of the 5-star reviews are from people who have only had this mattress for a week or so, they'll learn."
1,OMG - Warranty doesn't hold air. Neither does the bed.,"My bed turned out to be very disappointing. I got myIntex Supreme Air-Flow Queen Airbed Nylon Flocked with Built-in Electric Pumpon March 22, 2012 and today is May 22, 2012. My warranty expired on April 22. Twenty-eight days after the warranty expired, my bed started losing a small amount of air over night. I firm it up with air at bedtime and wake up on a soft mattress. Slow leak. Unable to find leak to repair.Except for the fact that it won't hold air anymore, I have enjoyed my airbed. I put a memory foam topper on it and I slept great."
2,Bought 2 of these..,"I bought 2 of them to take on a camping trip. 1st usage, 1 worked flawless, the other had a leak. too much trouble to figure out how to fix it, so I lost $ on it. Wished I would have bought an oversized Cot from Cabela's instead."
4,leak air easily,"i brought this airbed 2 months ago, and i sleep on it everyday. it leaks little air everyday, but it's fine. it's comfortable."
1,Airbed defective; unable to return,"I purchased this airbed in May, and had it shipped to Colorado where I would be staying. I selected this brand (Intex) because I had used one several years earlier and it lost air only marginally. Unfortunately, this was not the case with this Intex. It leaked right away, then developed a severe leak within 2 months. I tried a patch which helped initially, then it developed another. Amazon's return policy requires a return within 30 days and in unopened condition. How would one know of a defect? I lost nearly $100 on this purchase, and had to dispose of it."
1,WHAT A SHAME!,"I bought this air bed after much considerations and ofcourse my budget.Yes i received it on time.But this item started to deflate itself the first night. the first night i assumed that maybe, i didnt fill it properly. second night , the same thing. Actually afer my return from my July 4th vacation (i was away for three days),you can imagine my shock to find it deflated all the way to the ground!I was not impressed"
1,I would like this air mattress if...,...it didn't leak air!UGH!My new air mattress- leaks air and I haven't even used it yet. This is frustrating and disappointing. I would've liked this air mattress if it didn't do this.
1,Severe leak within 2 months,"I have bought 2 of these, as I figured the first one was probably just defective. However, BOTH of these beds developed a severe leak within the first 2 months of use. They leaked a little at the beginning then seemed to stabilize for awhile - then all of a sudden they were almost flat! The seller won't back it up and the return policy is within 30 days - which the leak happened after that. I am out the cost of 2 beds now. Will now go to a different brand as I am not impressed with Intex at all."
2,Intex Supreme airbed,"The bed looks pretty good and is higher then most. At first I loved it ,but have learned it requires air almost every night.I bought it as a permanent bed because of the comfort of an airbed versus standard mattresses.So I'm not too pleased with this particular product."
1,Was I just unlucky or is this a pattern ? I think it is a pattern !,"Bought this July 2, 2011,It is now October 21st. As of the beginning of October this thing was impossible to use anymore.I was faithful to all the advise here, in how to setup the mattress and letting it gradually inflate, and so on.I even had a 3 inch mattress cushion pad on the bed.At first it was great. My wife even approved of the decision.But this last only approximately 2 months, before it began leaking. AT first slowly, which I thought was ok as long as I refilled the mattress each morning. But soon it began to get so that we could not get through the night without the bed half deflating.Do what you want, but if I was you, I would stay far away from this air mattress. It is not worth the expense unless you want to buy a new one every other month."
1,Started out great then...Boom,"I was very satisfied with this bed. Very comfortable, didn't lose much air, but then one day, BOOM. It randomly got a giant bulge. The bulge kept growing, sprung two different leak spots, etc. It seems there is a flaw in the design. Seems like it has something to do with the diamond pattern element, feels like the inner bladder can easily penetrate through the thin layer of rubber. Was great while it lasted(4 weeks). Looks like I am not alone. I've seen a few pictures of the same bulge in the same spot.Intex Supreme Air-Flow Queen Airbed Nylon Flocked with Built-in Electric Pump"
1,BAD DEAL - BULGES ALL OVER,I purchased this bed about a year ago and shortly after the bulges appeared. Iam really disappointed in this product and the quality.I would really like a refund on the stupid purchase. What was I thinking?Sounds like more customers have had this same problem.
1,Disgusting air mattress and horrible customer service,"We were having out of town guests, so we were thrilled when our air mattress arrived. We filled it up and my first question was, ""Is there an electrical fire some place?"" As it turns out, the odor eminating from the air mattress was disgusting. No one could sleep on it. We put it in the garage for a few days hoping the odor would go away. However, we finally sent it back and the shipping was almost $30. When I talked to customer service at the River Rat Store...they said they wouldn't pay for shipping....even though the product was unusable. This is the first bad experience I have had ordering through Amazon....I am waiting for them to refund my money. I hope Amazon will make them give us back our shipping charges, as well as purchase price."
1,Beware! No warranty!,"Loved this bed until the top surface developed a hernia after two months of use. The bed was flat, comfortable, and held fitted sheets adequately. Then it developed a bulge on the sleeping surface. Intek does not warrant the product at all, and Amazon will not accept a return after 6 weeks. You just have to learn to live with your lumps."
5,its great!,It looks and feels like a real bed. In fact I like this bed more then I do my real mattress. The air pump fills it up in a bout 5 minutes I have nothing bad to say about this bed.
5,best air mattress,"This is truely a winner . Very stable mattress , I weight well over 300Lbs and this mat is not tippy and supports me well.The best part is 2 way air pump! awesome product."
1,poor airbed,"We bought this airbed according to the rating of amazon's customers reviews(very good) but it turned out to be a disappointed one. It starts to leak on the first night and it needs to be pumped every night. I guess with this low price, that's the quality we can get. It can only be used as a temporary bedding."
1,Air matress,"Shipment #1: Shipped on December 4, 2010 Queen Raised Air Mattress Day Bed w/ Quilted Air Pockets & Built-in Inflation Pump.Yes they want us review it the day we recieve it !! It was nice the first day, till March, then a big bump in the middle of the matress developed. I regretfully thought it was a bad matress, so I bought another. Guess what, same thing happned. Not a bad matress, just another cheap company, trying to make money off hard working Americans !"
5,A great product...,"It feels like a real bed. Keep in mind the TV advertised ""Number Bed,"" which uses air mattress technology with a remote control and more padding, sells for thousands. This is a bargain. I wish it came in King Size.-- Martin"
2,Almost like my bed!!!!,"UPSATE~~~~~~~~ We had slept on it for 3 nights and then stored it in it's box in the attic and got it out because my family was coming again and it has leaks and will not stay inflated, very comfortable bed but very disappointed in the quality and the fact we paid almost 100.00 to sleep on something less than a week.This is an outstanding bed and even more amazing guest bed. We got it over the holiday and it was going to be for my husband and I so mom could have our bed and heck I think I'd rather sleep on this one. Was real nervous about getting one of these type of beds since I have had 2 operations on my stomach in the last 6-8 weeks and was very unsure how I would sleep on one and let me tell you this was nothing like I would have thought! It was better. Best money spent!!"
3,Review,"The intex supreme air flow bed is more stable than older models, though noticed it loses air through the night, at least a little. Build in pump is great!"
1,"Great bed but, the pump quit and there is no fixing it so, its junk!",I purchased this bed for a spare guest room. We have used it a few times and its very comfortable and easy to make up. Tucking in the sheets makes it so easy. Unfortunately the built in electric pump quit working and the company does not warranty their products. Beware if you buy from Intex!! I am stuck with a huge flat bed with no way to pump it up to use. Amazon was kind enough to give me 1/2 my money back. I would research before I would buy another air mattress.
2,Comfortable but constant leaks,Adored this mattress until it started developing leaks. I returned it once to Amazon and got a replacement. Eventually combatted four leaks over the months that I fixed each time. The last one escaped my ability to discover it and I had to throw mattress out. Now these leaks were not caused by my carelessness. I had a mattress cover and sheets over mattress. One developed on an inside seam. Three were on the top where as I said nothing could penetrate my mattress cover and sheets. Big disappointment.
5,Great Airbed,This product has worked great since the day we got it. We leave it blown up in our spare room and my mother-in-law sleeps on it once a week. She loves the bed because it's very comfortable and it hasn't lost any air yet. It has been inflated for a few months now and we couldn't be happier with it.
2,False Advertising,"This bed looked great and reviewed great, BUT it is half a foot shy of a queen size bed. It is advertised as a 60 x 80 queen; this information needs to be corrected on your website or REMOVED. It was costly to return the item from overseas and meant that I had to continue to sleep on a back-breaker for another 6-8 weeks."
1,Horrible,"Bought to take with us to our kids' house and first night we slept on it, it deflated. And every night after. Unfortunately, we were stuck with it but we are returning it as soon as we are back to our house."
1,Loose Air,"I bought 2 of these for our guess after read the good Reviews. Both loose air after the first night of use. I bought other brands previously and had similar air leakage problem, thought Intex would be better but I was wrong. The fix-it-yourself patch that came with the air beds are useless because I can't locate the leak (small, slow leaks, I guess!) after spent an hour on each. I wonder why they included them with the air beds in the first place. Anyway, I'm done with Air Bed for good. The guesses will just have to deal with the Sofa."
2,Don't throw the packaging away,"This is a really nice looking bed and its really comfortable.However, after the first night, spent most of the next nightputting air in it. I am so disappointed. I don't even want areplacement. I bought a more expensive on for the holiday, butI will definitely keep the packaging and will return it if it does notmeet my expectation."
1,Fails Quickly,"This is a bed that has all the potential to be a great product. It is comfortable to sleep on and very easy to inflate. However, even with exceptionally good care, it began to leak after only three uses and has become, for all intents and purposes, unusable. I strongly recommend against buying it."
5,"Who knew an ""Airbed"" could be so comfortable?","It's a great purchase! I couldn't afford a traditional mattress right now, and a friend suggested this- It's WONDERFUL!Very comfortable, I LOVE IT.Thank you1"
4,"So far, so good!","The first mattress like this one that I bought elsewhere developed a volleyball size hump in the mattress, but they wouldn't take it back because I had it longer than 30 days. I really liked how the mattress slept, so I found this company and decided to try it again. I do have to put air in it about once a week, but it is very easy to do this. Just plug it in, and push a button for about 15-20 seconds and you're done. Having the double decker mattress, I feel like I'm sleeping in my regular bed. I need a firm mattress and you can adjust this so easily by adjusting the amount of air, it really surprised me that it sleeps so well."
5,Works great for guests. No problem in last year!,"We had to get a new airmattress due to old one leaking. This one is awesome! We did what other people suggested and blew it up and let it sit for 3 days then deflated it till we needed to use it. btw-it never lost air and hasn't even when people sleep on it. We have used it for my mom, mother-in-law, friends and teenagers. All have slept well and said very comfortable. Super easy set up, plug it in and it goes...same for deflation. It is a little heavy when we have to put it away but it is probably the nicest air mattress we have purchased. It is way better than those small ones that lay on close to floor. This is almost like its own mattress. I would even suggest this for a cheap short term bed it is that great! Great price! only bad thing we can't take it camping due to the whole plug-in outlet thing."
3,First one defective,I read positive reviews on this product and sent as a gift to a family member because they needed it for additional bed for company. First one received did not work and second shipped which does work at least for now. Problem is returning the first one has turned into a nightmare. I am still trying to get someone to pick it up a month later. This would have never happened if the thing had not been defective in the first place. Amazon is hard to get in touch with real person and I got different stories on return info. Don't know if I would order this kind of item again as a gift; I felt bad that someone else had to deal with returning such a large item.
1,Extremely Disappointed,"I purchased this airbed in anticipation of having overnight guests at New Year's. The very first time we used it, it slowly deflated due to a small air leak on the botton half. Half way through the night, my guests almost ended up on the floor. They decided to sleep on the couches instead. Very embarassing and disappointing. I have been purchasing items from Amazon for several years and am upset that they would sell this inferior product. To make matters worse, I can't return it or get a replacement since I am passed the return window timeframe. I purchased in October, window closed in November. I didn't use it for the first time until December 31st, but that doesn't matter apparently.DO NOT BUY THIS AIRBED!"
2,Not for long term use,I have slept on this every night for five months. It was very comfortable for four months but now it has a huge bump int the middle and no longer holds air through out the night.Deb N
1,Stay Away,"I purchased a similar Intex Queen size airbed for about $ 60.00 with the inside air pump...It lasted for 100 days, and had the same problem as shown on this bed...Called Intex..Only warranty is with the store that you purchased the product...usually 90 days max...The company implied that I over pressurized the mattress; but why did it last for 100 days; if I over-pressurized it from day 1 ?? I've had air beds since a young boy....40+ years"
2,Slow leak,So the pros for this mattress is that it blows up easily and quickly with a the flip of the switch. That's an important feature since mid way through the night you will need to add more air. It doesn't matter if it is being used or not. It just slowly leaks.
3,Intex Supreme Air-Flow Queen Bed,"Beware - this bed is NOT queen size as stated - it is full size. It is quite comfortable, but if you are looking for a Queen size bed, this is not the one for you."
4,Intex Supreme Air-Flow Queen Airbed Nylon Flocked with Built-in Electric Pump,I bought this bed about a month back. It has so far kept upto expectations and gives a feeling of a real bed. Woud advice inflating for about a minute everyday to retain the firmness.would definitely recommend a buy for this product.
1,Loses air,"After only 3 uses, this air mattress now loses air to the point that it's unusable. Can't even get through a night without having to refill the mattress. I would not recommend purchasing this mattress."
1,BEWARE No Warranty - Intex Refused to fix Defective Product,Intex says there is NO MANUFACTURER'S WARRANTY. We received this bed as a gift. The inflation/deflation mechanism doesn't work. Intex says it isn't their problem.
3,Go Ahead and Buy It,"I bought this album after listening to the preview for track 3, ""Beautiful Bruise"". There's no way someone could hear that and not want to buy this album. I can't say that I've given it the most thorough listening, but I've gone through the album and would have to give it 3 stars. Not the best thing in the World, but still worth buying. It's not prohibitively expensive, so I really want to give it 4 stars. But, if I ignore price entirely, the fact remains that it's only a 3-star album. I still think anyone who likes psychedelic rock and enjoys finding rare music out there needs this, but I can't lie and say every song's a hit."
5,MR. FRANTICS LEGEND LIVES ON!!!,"Ronnie Self was one of a kind. His music makes you want to get up and move. It's nice to know that his music is still available for many to hear and in great demand. For all his fans, there is a big surprise coming! His son, Roman Self(Dallas's uncle)has just finished up his 1st promo CD with a new song ""2002 Year Blues"" written by his father Ronnie Self, never before released to the public. BOP-A-LENA is a must for anyone who is serious about rocking music!!!"
2,Cat Toy,My cat was not the least bit interested in this. This might be better for a really youn feline--not one that's middle-aged.
2,Petmate Bat N Bobble Interactive Cat Toy,"Well, at least my cat doesn't seem to like this toy, Never ever was interested to play with it... there are some other better toys I think."
4,Great Stuff,"There's so much quality stuff on these discs it's hard to know where to begin. The sound quality is better than on the previous Bear Family box (Blue Moon of Kentucky) and even if the songs aren't quite up to the same level as his '40s recordings there's almost as many top notch tunes. This is the era when Bluegrass really took off and the competition was fierce what with Flatt & Scruggs, the Stanley Bros, Reno & Smiley and all the rest putting out their best work. Monroe was still a force to be reckoned with and his Mandolin was never recorded as well as it was during this decade. Every instrumental song he cut in the '50s is ace and the musicians in his band were stellar: Jimmy Martin, Vassar Clements, Rudy Lyle & Charlie Cline all passed through the Bill's ranks during the time chronicled on this set.Do yourself a favor and pick it up (after Blue Moon of Kentucky though). You'll be glad you did."
5,Another great box set,"This box set contains many hard to find cuts from the 50's. Although there are many less expensive box sets available, this one is well worth the price! From instrumentals to great harmonies, this one has it all! A must have for any collector of Monroe's library of bluegrass music!"
2,Only for the sensitive and depressed.,"Frusciante has had some shining momnets, but SFTSYH, isn't one of them. There are a couple of good tracks here and there, but as a whole, this CD was boring.Stick with his RHCP stuff, or Niandra Lades."
1,Good Guitar Work with Terrible Vocals,"I am a big RHCP fan, but I was extremely disappointed with this record. John is an excellent guitar player, but with this record, you can't really tell. He is one of the worst singers I have ever heard."
1,Worst excuse for vocals this side of Yoko Ono,This is some good (not great) guitar work marred by some unfortunate vocals. A huge disapointment.
1,Junk,Just because this music is unlistenable doesn't mean that it's deep or meaningful or that I don't get it.This is the sound of someone dying and it's not beautiful.
2,Frowning from my room,"I love John Frusciante's music. This was the last CD of his that is released that I had to get, and I got it. I was expecting music. About 5 of the tracks on here are music. The rest is the sound of a dying junkie. I know that is a terrible and powerful thing. I understand and respect the awful things that have happened to John, and that were happening to him when he made this CD. But that does not make it ""beautiful,"" ""brilliant,"" or any other such thing. Look at my other reviews, I love Frusciante's MUSIC to death. But not this. Get all the rest, but not this."
2,not a patch on his first,"John Frusciante is a genius I concur with the other reviewers there, but I think that a lot of them have got a bit carried away with his ""honesty"" and neglected the quality of the Cd. There are 4 or 5 good songs and I am sorry but that is not enough for a 17 track CD. For anyone interested in getting into John buy the first album, the first 8 songs are ground breaking yet easy to listen to, the rest is self-indulgent drivel but at least there is enough there to make it worthwhile. If John took these songs into a studio with a producer he could make a classic album, but maybe the lack of production is the beauty. At least Rick Rubin can now keep him in line."
3,Johnny's primal second offering..,"John Frusciante played a big part I believe in getting the Chili Peppers on MTV with his Hendrix-flavored licks, then bailed (but has since returned, thank god) when they pursued that more lucrative avenue. His two solo records reveal the sort of LP that John is interested in. His first, 'Niandra Lades', is strange, Syd Barrett-esque mixed bag. Some of it was like a collage of sound and quite haunting and compelling. 'Smile From The Streets You Hold' has little of that album's charm, unfortunatly, and can be a bit difficult to listen to. His playing is still usually up to snuff, but the focuslessness of the songs show his painful struggle with heroin. For me, he's one the most soulful, honest, and original artists in these times of the packaged-in-plastic pop star, regardless."
1,This record is embarrassingly bad.,"I really can't help but sneer at all of these reviews boasting the supposed brilliance of this dreck. I can enjoy noisy and off-kilter music when it's done well, but this is just feeble. All musicianship aside, as a singer and songwriter John Frusciante is hopelessly inept. I'm almost incredulous that anyone could mistake such blatant mindless self-indulgence for genius, and if I were naive enough to expect people in general to have any taste I would be. Don't waste your time searching for something meaningful or worthwhile in this mess of a record unless you tend to mistake absurdity for profundity. Music like this is really only intended for a certain niche of pretentious pseudo-intellectuals who, as most of these reviews demonstrate, are given to hyperbole."
4,RIP Fat Pat,"The Album itself gets 5 Stars, I Love Fat Pat's Music. The only reason I only gave this 4 stars is because in-between some of the tracks on my Amazon MP3 Download there is this REALLY annoying ""Clicking"" sound that I'm sure is not good for my subs in my truck."
4,Fat Pat Greatest Hits,"Very good album. If you like the mid to late 90's southern beats(UGK,S.U.C.,....) you will not be disappointed. A must have for any hip hop collection."
1,Ditto Cheap Hardware,"I purchased this case in September 2011 and was relatively happy with it until I opened it today and one of the latches broke. It was made with very thin pot metal typical of low-quality ""Made in China"" products. Product received light usage. It is now useless. So much for warranties of merchantability."
4,. . . one caution.,"I love these pans. They are just what I was looking for. Bakes even, loafs come out easly ... love them. Except .. Please use caution washing them, the metal edges are so sharp I got little paper cuts all over my hands befor I realized what was happening. My friend says most people use gloves, .. I don't, but would be a good idea with these."
5,Love it,"Best little loaf pans I have ever had. I am a bread making machine. I bake every week (if not more often). Don't bother with separate pans if you want mini loaves. These are the best. Easy to clean. Easy to store. Easy to remove from the oven. Not too tiny either. Perfect for cute little sandwiches. They are slightly smaller in volume than the ones that I have that are not connected. Watch that, if you need them to be larger. One loaf is probably about as big as two generous dinner rolls."
5,Popular with Armored Divisions,"I sure wish my other car was a tank. Armored division personnel, usually tankers, like this one. Of course, a very few civilians also own tanks modified to drive on the street, and I could see this bumper sticker on their car, or truck. Then there are those of us who just wish we had a tank, and the bumper sticker then makes for a great conversation piece."
5,Triplet mom loves this gate,"Being a mom of three 11 month olds, we needed a sturdy gate for a wide opening. This gate and a couple extensions worked great. We placed a couple bends in the sections, rather that running straight across, to add strenth to the gate. The triplets cannot budge this gate. The swing gate and opening mechanism is smooth to operate with one hand. While the gate is costly, it's worth every penny. My spouse installed it easily and commented on the high quality and workmanship."
1,Waste of time,Gate arrived in poor condition without all of its parts. It appears that we received a gate that someone else had returned and they didn't bother to check whether it contained all of the mounting hardware required for installation. Will be returning.
1,KidCo Configurgate Repair Gouges Consumer,"I purchased a ConfigurGate that is now outside of warranty. They no longer sell replacement parts for a poorly designed plastic part that supports the gate near the hinge point. Instead, they offered to sell me a new door for almost $100 (Price gouging) whereas the retail price on a whole new gate is not much more. It is probably about a 50 cent part that is broken. Based on poor design and lack of parts support, I would not buy another product from KidCo."
4,Hard to set up but easy to use,"I found this gate hard to set up - the instructions weren't as clear as I would have liked and did not mention to remove the vertical bars before trying to adjust sections. (I am a minor DIYer).It's great once it's in place, though! It is very sturdy and the gate is easy to open if you have a free hand."
3,Ouch!! Don't trip over the floor bar!,"We have a wide opening between our living and dining rooms. It certainly keeps our one and two year old children out of the dining/kitchen area. The problem I've had is that there is a one inch square bar that you step over when you open the swing gate. I was carring my little daughter into the dining area from the living area and my foot cought the bar. We went flying fortunately I was able to push away from the table so my daughter didn't get rammed into the table. I ,however,injured my knee badly and have to have surgery to repair my muniscus and I have a torn pcl that surgery isn't an option for. BE CAREFUL if you decide to go ahead with it. Tell guest in your home to also watch their step. People are too sue happy today."
5,Awesome!,"I wish other children's safety gates were designed as easy to install and versatile as these. I love the fact that you can position the wall attachments so you can avoid base boards, for example. Very sturdy and look great. The only drawback is that I can't use these over my stairs because they don't have an adjustable width (outside of the fixed extension widths)."
5,Super gate system,Can't say enough good things about it! Best gate system on the market by a landslide![...]
3,"The Good, The Bad and The Ugly.","This gate is great if you want to section off a large opening or area. We have triplets and they have been kept out of harms way for quite a while with this gate.They are 17 mos. now and one of my daughters has figured out how to open the gate. I don't know how she has the strength but she has watched us open and close the gate enough to try it herself. Well, she figured it out and now I have to try and figure out a secondary way to keep the gate closed.There should be some other type of lock that can be used in addition to the pressure lock that it comes with.All in all, if your kids don't learn to open the gate - it is very good."
4,Perfect for difficult areas,We have two landings where we use these gates and they work really well for them. The first one was a little tricky to install but the second was much easier to do. I love the magnetic latch because I know the gate will close every time. It can be difficult to open sometimes but I'd rather that than have it open too easily and have my child sneak through.
5,Works Well,It was the best option for our odd shape at the base of our stairs. It was simple to install. I am very happy with the product.
3,"Did the trick, but not ideal","I needed a gate mounted up against a wall on once side (with the opening) and about 3 feet on the other end. I really needed this gate plus one or two expansion panels, but the expansion panels where way too much money. I ended up using both of the sides panels on one side using nylon ties. It worked, it keeps my 18 month child out of the kitchen.Would I buy again? I'd do my best to find something else, but I haven't found anything else that would work for this kind of layout for anywhere near this price.The handle to open will likely keep the kids at bay for a while. It won't close on it's own, so it's slightly annoying for adults."
3,Flimsy,This product would be very helpful but the bars are bent and the the angles that are not attached to the wall are not sturdy. We wanted it to be a secure gate that would keep our son from falling down the stairs. We will keep it because it is better than nothing but we will still have to watch him closely so that he doesn't push it down and fall.
5,Great Gate!!,"I installed this gate myself, the directions where easy to follow and the gate is sturdy and fits the odd shape of my stairs. I would recommend this gate to anyone."
2,not for mechanically inclined toddlers/infants,"My son figured out how to push the top of this gate open by the time he was 14 months old. If your toddler is not mechanically inclined it will be a great gate, it is easy to take down and put back up. However, I now have to get a new gate and I have only had this one 6 months. I have the pressure gate as well. and to this day I have never used the latch mechanism. he hasn't figured out to simply lift the gate. PLEASE think about your childs mechanical intuitiveness before choosing this gate."
4,Good Baby Gate,"This is a good gate. It was relatively easy to setup, so only took about 30 minutes. The ability to fit a non-standard area makes it great. I only wish the gate door had an automatic closing mechanism. I have a dreambaby gate in a standard hall opening and the automatic gate is a very good feature. You can't forget to close it."
5,EVEN HELD UP TO MY FAMILY OF FIVE FOR 2 YEARS!,"We purchased this particular gate after much research. This gate can mount at any angle and even different angles on opposite walls! We used it to span 14' using a zig zag pattern. It required we purchase extra gates (main and 4 extensions) but that gate was sturdy. It stood up to constant use by my family of five, even my 11 yr old boy hanging on it constantly. Wall hardware is minimal but sturdy. The gate easily (and I mean EASILY) unclips from the wall hardware for us to clean or have a party. It also kept my little one and hyper pup seperated while I couldn't keep an eye on them both. Great peace of mind from a great gate! buy it!"
5,Wisest investment,"The Kidco gate is wonderful. As many others, I was hesitant in spending a lot of money on a gate. My son however knocked down everything else. We purchased the gate and were so suprised at how well it worked. Very easy to install and very easy to use."
5,Best gate,"We bought this gate to keep our new lab puppy in certain area's of the house. It is installed in a 6ft opening. My husband is over 6ft and is able to step over it (most days without tripping).This gate can withstand our 40lb-4 month old lab. He puts his front paws on it and literally jumps straight in the air. He can't get past it because he doesn't have anything to leverage his back feet on. Other times he is bouncing off it--charging at it (trying to get to the cats). It doesn't move at all.Each side installs with 3 screws. The gate swings easily in both directions with a squeeze of one hand. Toddlers wouldn't be able to open it, but older children might be able to with 2 hands. The slats are not large enough for our cats to walk thru, they have to climb over but can easily jump with a lab pup on their tail. :)"
3,"Close, but no cigar...","Owning the Robben Ford/Ford Blues Band ""Tribute to Paul Butterfield,"" I was ecstatic when I saw this live version tribute. Well, while the previous might even be on a ""desert island"" list, this newer one pales in comparision. Don't get me wrong, playing is almost all first rate, but Ford's use of pedals or effects takes away from his playing. Add to that, there are only two songs with harp on this recording. ""Killing Floor"" starts out really first rate, but eventually ends like a good bar-band that didn't quite get the arrangement right. ""Groovin' Is Easy"" is better, but similar. Would I buy tickets to their show, probably without question. But I am not sure I will listen to this whole CD again in a long time. I hope the ""Tribute to Mike Bloomfield"" is better..."
1,Wish I could use a zero for possible monetary con as well as quackery if I could,"First, the possible monetary con. The author attempted to solicit money from me, or at the least my help in getting money, which I suspect to be part of a potential con.I quote from selections from her e-mail to me:""Dear Stephen:Here attached an Article about the book The Theory of Natural Systems (Amazon Books). Hope it will be of interest to you as well as the book. ...We are in need of very limited but urgent funds - loans or grants - for two purposes:Best wishes, Maria Gaydos""I don't know Ms. Gaydos from Eve, so I'm highly suspicious.Second, as far as the blurb on this webpage, a degree in industrial chemistry is a long way away from one in molecular biology. And other language in the blurb, and her solicitation of me, sounds very New Age/""metaphysical.""Hence the ""quackery"" part of my review.Run like hell from this book."
5,To counter Stephen J. Synders review of someone he does'nt know.,"I know Maria Costell for over ten years, and her methods of trying to raise funds for research may not be the most popular to some. She dose'nt know a great deal about marketing ideas to raise funds. Doctor Gaydos does work nearly all day, who is 80 years old, and tries her best to translate her research from her native speaking language of spanish into english. And lastly Stephen J. Synder is NOT an editor, and reviewer of medical research books."
5,MORE MORE MORE,"Hey, people at Amazaon! You should have more albums from this funky, amazing, creative artist. I was lucky to get other Renis' CDs (""Era Renifera"" and ""Elektrenika""). Both are even better than the debut ""Zakrecona"". She, along Kayah, is one of the most interesting female artists in Poland. Her latest album ""elektrenika"" blends everything what clubbing music should have, a little bit of trance, dance, techno, jungle, 70's disco, etc. A must have for anyone who likes to groove, and knows that there's nothing better than ""Pozytywne Wibracje"""
3,unintended format,"I thought I was orderring a book which I had seen a copy of years ago in the local library, but I found that it was a CD instead. I tried again later and did order the book, but until then I was disappointed that I didn't have what I wanted."
5,Excellent Seller,The book I ordered for my grandson was shipped very quickly and packed well. I was very pleased with the service and would buy from this Seller again.
1,Item has changed,"It didn't work for me because I couldn't hang the bag properly on my bedside because of the length(its length(from the the top of the handle to the bottom of the splashguard is a hair shy of 14"" long,length of the forked hanger on the top is less than 2"" on both sides. I also tried hanging the bag on my commode next to the bed and as the bag filled it slid off/dropped to the floor on me if it reached between 700 & 800 cc's because the distance between the top of the handle and the actual bag is over 2"",it would not support the weight when hanging off the commode-I will say that on a hospital bed the setup is probably Very good. I also could not hang it on my chair hook because the length would have it sitting on the floor of my foot rest."
1,Buy it for your little sister,"If you're twelve and think that you may be into house music, then buy this CD. Never has anything so sophomoric been recorded."
3,Very Disappointed,"I loved 555 Fabulous Cross-Stitch Patterns so brought this book by Ms. Kooler. Imagine how disappointed I was when I brought this book and the first 555 designs were the same as in 555 Fabulous Cross-Stitch Patterns. The covers were even the same. I feel ripped off by the publisher. But that said I still love the designs. They great for small bazaar projects such as sachets, magnet, bookmarks, etc. They're perfect for the beginner and can be done using leftover floss."
5,"A ""must have"" for the business traveler!","I picked up a copy of ""Rosalie's Guide"" before a recent business trip to Boston. The book really enhanced my trip. The information provided was extremely helpful, and the summaries are dead on. Anyone planning a trip to Boston should buy a copy."
2,nothing worthwhile,"I dont know why I was expecting something new when I started watching this movie. It turned out to be same old, same old. And its not even in the same class as the others in the same genre,like Fatal Attraction for example. it was a waste of my time."
2,some scenes reminded me of the fatal attraction,"In my opinion Beyonce's performance was not convincing, for example Elba's character after he was drugged and the other woman slept with him, Elba's character and Beyonce's character were arguing and Elba's character said, ""where do you want me to go""? and Beyonce's character said, ""to hell, until then go to the four seasons, take your toothbrush"". I was like okay that didnt make sense and plus that ugly baby that was in the movie, they could have least pick a better looking child."
1,Why didn't Obsessed win the Razzies?,"This one should win Worst Picture, Worst Actress (Beyonce) and Worst Supporting Actress(Ali Larter) and Worst Actor (Idris Elba). Matthew Humphreys should win a Razzie too as the stupidest secretary in the world. He is so stupid that after the sex thing between his boss and Ali Larter - he can even reveal info to Larter. Doesn't the stupid sec listen to office gossip! Bosses, don't employ such stupid secretaries. Even the police are so stupid. However Obsessed should win awards for clothes and stilltoes. However Beyonce should have stomped Larter with her boots."
4,good movie,"Alot of people didn't like this movie...I loved this movie. It was different. And not so much to make a scary movie, but definitely suspenseful. I could see watching it with your girlfriends for those ""oh no she didn't"" moments. It's a good movie. I don't really get the bad reviews, but hey, that's just me."
3,UMMM.......Try again,"Beyonce was not right for this menial part. Her acting wasn't for this part. (Beyonce is too good for this) Now she is a good actor and I would have loved to see her as the wife but this tacky story line was not for her. Idris Elba played his part. (I love me some Idris!!) And Ali Larter played hers . BUT this movie was low grade; well the story line was anyway and worst of all it wasn't finished.Okay in the end, what happened? Did they go to court? Did the detective find out the truth? (I mean the truth speaks for itelf but the movie should give you the answer) Did Beyonce understand what happened without you guessing? I mean in the end there are a lot of gaps.Overall, the movie is okay but wait for it to come out on cable or borrow it!!! TRUST ME!!! It should be televised on network tv maybe even BET."
1,Cliches Abound,"I have never listened to Beyonce's music, but by Amazon insistence, I purchased this movie. I had never seen Fatal Attraction, but someone passed me a copy because they said that this was just an updated version of that movie.Beyonce's character although a good wife and mother came across like Regina King's character in Jerry Maguire which made this movie more of a cliche, made to lure the black audience to the theatres.I love Amazon.Com and trust it's judgement when it comes to my recommendations, but this was not what I was looking for, maybe if I were a female."
1,THIS MOVIE IS A JOKE,I was excited to see this movie then i saw it and found out its a load of crap. dont buy it
2,Different Characters Same Soup Left Over,There's nothing different or imaginative about this movie. Basically If you see Fatal Attraction you have seen this movie. Except for minor details. Not even Beyonce and Ali Larter would have made this movie better.Save your money buy something else. Rent Fatal Attraction instead.
5,I love this movie.,This is a great movie and if you are a huge Beyonce fan like i am then you will buy it. It had me on the edge of my seat.
1,Yawn...,"Did they really need to try and remake 'Fatal Attraction'? And why do they think Beyonce is an actress? Oh, wait a minute...she Executive Produced this so she has to get that credit just like she has 'Producer' credits for Cadillac Records. Hmmm, so if you back the movie you are instantly considered an actress. What a concept. Oh well, it doesn't matter. This mindless waste of film is not necessary. Don't waste your time or money. Thankfully, my hubby and I didn't have to pay to see this. We read enough reviews and heard from our friends that this was a bore."
2,Just Awful.,"I liked this movie a lot better in 1987 when it was called ""Fatal Attraction."" Beyoncé Knowles was a HUGE disappointment. She may have the singing voice of a shrieking angel, but her speaking voice is atrocious. She speaks like some sort of gutter rat throughout the film. She also a terribly bland ""actress"". Idris Elba plays an honorable husband who also happens to be a clueless moron. Jerry O'Connell plays an annoying, useless moron. The real scene-stealer is Ali Larter, she plays a crazy b**ch Glenn Close would be proud of. Beyoncé does manage to redeem herself at the end, but you kind of saw it coming a mile away. YAAAAWN."
1,"please, get the message!","Can anyone tell me why some singer of cheesy ballads always gets an acting career? Didn't they learn anything from Jlo?Totally predictable, and both the husband ( object of crazy obsession, and long suffering husband that no one believes Idris Elba)and the wildly sex crazed temp, Ali Lauter are servicable in this waste of screen. But Beyonce is a wash out, and the only time you can believe her character is when she goes all ghetto on the temp. I don't care how much money Jayz and Ditty have, why do the studios allow these talantless singers to have an acting job to start with, will they ever learn?Save your money, save your time."
2,kinda disspaointed,"Just wanted to say, that I purchased a dvd claiming to be in good condition, and it isnt. The whole movie was fine but at the last 15 minutes of the movie the screen freezes..so you dont even know what happens at the end of it!! Not too happy with this... the next thing you know when the screen finally unfreezes you are watching credits.. Will not purchase anything else from this seller."
1,Maybe the worst movie of any kind...ever,"Horrible in every way -- written by people who clearly have no clue how married couples...or anyone...relate to one another. It rates one star for the attractiveness of the actors, but even the inevitable girl fight at the end is so stupidly done it's a complete snooze. And what is the deal with Jerry O'Connell's hair?! He has such a bizarre do, we were sure he was going to turn out to be in on it somehow."
1,Boring........,"Wow, I would see just about anything with Beyonce. But don't you hate films that make people look stupid? Talk to your boss, talk to your friends, call the police, their all clueless. I have to say ""Shame on you Beyonce"", you are so talented and even though your strong character held this whatever film together, your work usually has some kind of meaning to it."
1,On no she didn't!,"Want to see a supremely watered down version of Fatal Attraction? If so, look no further than Obsessed, a potboiler that holds back much more than it succeeds in terms of being a potboiler. The Wire's Idris Elba stars as a successful corporate man who also plays loving family man to his wife (Beyonce Knowles), and soon becomes the target of psychotic young temp (Heroes' Ali Larter). Wholly predictable and cliche, Obsessed is mind numbingly dull from beginning to end, but I guess this is the kind of thing that passes for suspense these days that mainstream audiences seem to eat right up. Elba is disappointing wasted in his role, while Knowles and Larter do their respective parts at looking gorgeous, and doing nothing else as well. All in all, Obsessed is something that you could easily save yourself a few brain cells by not giving the time of day, and spending your viewing time on something more worthwhile."
1,Strictly avoidable,"A movie that borrows its theme from A hand that rocks the cradle, Disclosure and Fatal Attraction is a movie that stars Idris Elba, Beyonce and Ali Larter. Beyonce and Idris are a young couple who are in love and trouble comes in the form of obsessive Ali Larter as Lisa Sheridan who is a temp in Idris's office. She becomes obsessed with Idris and trouble ensues. It is up to the wife, to take matters in her hands.I thought the movie was badly directed with no chemistry between Idris and Beyonce. Idris was great in the Wire but is wasted. Beyonce needs some acting lessons because she is extremely wooden and unconvincing as the wife scorned. There are several holes in the story which are unexplained, like Lisa's past. I only watched this movie because it was on Netflix instant play and my next rental had not arrived. I give it one star. 2/17/10"
2,"As Many Cliches As Your Typical ""Lifetime Movie Of The Week""!","This movie is very predictable and follows the exact script of so many of those movies made for the ""Lifetime"" movie network. A married man stalked and harrassed by a beautiful temptress.Tiger Woods would have not resisted, but can the man in this movie resist her advances? She is super-model hot, so any man would have difficulty in this situation.I recommend this if you want to rent a movie for your date night with your female companion, especially if she loves ""Lifetime-style"" movies. Do not pay more than $5.00 if you buy it!Thank you for reading!"
3,Just OK,Not as good as I exptected it to be but was just ok. Kind of like Fatal Attraction only the acting wasn't half as good as the actors in that movie. Kind of surprised this one even made it into the movie theaters and didn't go straight to video.
3,Movie Review,"Unfortunately, the movie hit a damaged spot and we had to advance it, but as disappointed as we were, knew that it was not quite 'new' and thankfully we got to view the rest of it and the movie itself was good. It taught me that it might work for some but we should just bite the bullet & choose new when purchasing."
3,You can't be good at everything.....,"First, I am a huge Beyonce fan, love her when she's singing and dancing and doing her best Sasha Fierce. But, however, she is not a great actress. She wasn't believable in this role, I kept waiting for her or someone to jump up and say, ""PSYCH we were just playing; now here's the real movie."" For the future, she should stick with musicals or light comedies or romantic comedies but NO MORE thrillers or dramas......please."
2,another rehash of plots,"This movie was another rehash of old plots, average to poor acting and extremely predictable. The movie truly was a waste of time, effort, as well as a waste of money creating it. To make matters worst, not only is it a rehash of plots, but its not as good as the plots it borrowed from. Don't waste your time with this one."
3,Im taking the stairs from now on!,I knew Idris Elba was doomed when he was on the elevator from the start. He should've listened to that little voice that said take the stairs. It didn't help that he rubbed her shoulder in the lunch room though. This Movie was like a watered down Fatal Attraction and Swimfan even holds its own but this movie left alot to be desired. It must've sucked to be Idris Elba because he was raped by Ali Larter (Lisa) while on drugs while the other guys cheated on their women. Man thats just sick! Ali Larter is just the infatuated bully who makes Idris wish he picked the swing instead of the slide to hang at because she shows up everywhere she is not expected to be even in his car with revealing clothes. The final fight scene with Beyonce and Ali was epic!
1,WARNING: Watching this movie may cause misery.,"Somebody please tell me how trash like this gets made? Oh, I forgot. It was produced by Beyonce. Note to Beyonce: Please stay out of the movie making business. At any rate, I will give the credit to a friend who picked this movie out on DVD. After watching about 30 minutes, I couldn't bare it anymore. Completely unoriginal, full of cliches, predictable, borrrring!"
5,Good Baby Oil from a trusted Brand,I choose to buy this from Amazon because I was'nt able to find the 'Creamy' Baby Oil in store. I had to pay for delivery and wait a little while but it was worth all the fuss.The Creamy Baby oil is more effective than the regular Johnsons Baby Oil both for the winter as well as the summer. It moisturises and soothes.
2,Not very helpful,"I thought it would give me additional resources for my classes, it only told me how to use the book which was already apparent from the student addition itself."
4,This was the Top Band in Colorado,"When I was in high school in Colorado in the ""surf/hot rod"" era of the early/mid 60's this group from Boulder was ""the"" top band around. They packed every spot they played.Their music was on local radio.When I found theses CD's I was amazed. Listening to them brought back long forgotten memories. They played at our Senior prom, something they rarely did.Great albums for memories if you grew up listening to them in Colorado in the 60's."
3,Battery lasted less than 2 years,My battery was exactly like that pictured--a replacement for the original 1217 in my Belkin UPS system. I keep my computer system up 24/7. The original 1217 lasted 5 years. Battery problem or excessive power surging lately here in Seattle area.? You pays your money and you takes your pick!!
5,Identical to the APC battery,"This battery is identical (same make and model) to the original factory battery in my APC brand UPS, but is about 1/3 the price of the official APC replacement. Shipping from Portable Power was much faster than I expected. There's no reason to pay more for the APC-branded battery."
1,Bad,"This book, even though I didn't use it much, is mediocre. Read a few website's and you're ahead of this books material. Needs to have a better stance for college students."
1,Official Member of Parliament,"Hi there, guys!I bought this cd back in 1998, and i must say that this cd is by far the most pathetic disc i ever bought. The lyrics make no sense *at all*; my own beats sound better. I cannot recommend this to anybody. If you want to be smart, spend those 10 on something worth while. I seriously hope this truthful review will lead you to the right path referring to your decision. If I were you, i would consider listening to john denver instead. He can rock better than john denver himself."
2,Eh,This cd has good songs but more wack ones then tight ones. I actually regret this purchase myself. This cd isn't nearly as good as king of da players ball.
5,A Really Great Album,"I had never before in my life heard of Kingpin Skinny Pimp until my friend bought this album. After listening to it, I knew I must have it. It has fresh beats and it's just fun to listen to. Normally, I don't like rap music a lot, but I truly love this album!! I would advise everybody to own this album! It's wonderful!"
5,"12 x 8 is kind of smaller than I pictured, but it will do the trick","12 x 8 is kind of smaller than I pictured, but it will do the trick and is really pretty and solid. On the positive side, it fits well on the counter top. Forgot to mention I searched Amazon for ""made in USA"" and this was a good find."
5,Perfect for individual steak/ meat servings.,These products came undamaged and ready to use. I read many reviews that talked about shipping issues and damaged boards. Well either i was a lucky one or they fixed their problems with figuring out how to ship the boards. The juice groove is deep to allow for extra juicy cuts of meat and the size is perfect for a 16 oz T bone! We will enjoy for years to come hopefully
4,Read it,"Not the fastest flowing of books, but it sure packs a punch. You know this has to be true - the credibility is there and you know what - look it up on the internet - you can even hear the conversations with those beyond life. John has produced some exceedingly interesting books and to my mind convincingly real - get yourself any of his volumes and you won't be sorry"
5,People are stupid!,"I ran into the book a long time ago. And while I was reading it I had to recheck the spine of the book to make sure it did indeed say NON-Fiction.I felt John Grant Fuller should have told the world, media press, papers,everyone! They should have made 50 of these things and then turned them all on the same day around the world. they would provide us with closure when a plane crashes, and also when your wife dies, you can go be with here for a bit when your sad. So if these things in the book did indeed happen then I think we a re all stupid for not re-doing the experiment. Thomas Edison even speculated on the creation of the device. All I know is that I want four if them.The book was easy reading and made chills run up and down my spine.Maby I will Re-create the Experiment Riffkinn"
3,Unsatisfying,"This book is a good representation of small-town Ireland. It contains all the stereotypical characters that we've all encountered in real life, and gives an honest portrayal of our attitudes towards them. It also gives an interesting perspective to relationships, showing how the same event can be interpreted very differently by two different people.Despite this, I found this book pretty tough going. The style of writing takes a good while to get used to as it switches back and forth between past and present fairly often. It's also a lot darker than I expected - this is NOT a comedy, despite being written by Ardal O'Hanlon. There were some good points to the book, but I finished it feeling somewhat unsatisfied.Note: I also posted this review on Goodreads."
2,Uninspired,"Irish comic O'Hanlon has written a largely unmemorable coming of age novel starring the entirely unsympathetic and creepy 18-year-old Patrick. He works as a security guard in Dublin and periodically takes the bus to his home hamlet on weekends, allowing the reader a glimpse into both city and small town life in early '80s Ireland. While certain set pieces and milieus are descriptively evoked, the overall story of the ethically confused boy and his relationship with college student Francesca doesn't really hold together. The novel is more effective when it breaks off into excerpts from Franceca's diary, detailing her side of their relationship. However, this too, is problematic, as you know that eventually Patrick will be reading it, and only bad things will result. All in all, it lacks the humor I had expected, and is very bleak. Elements of it are highly reminiscent of The Butcher Boy."
3,Helpful Hollies Hints #2,"To begin with, I've recently learned that leadsinger, Allan Clarke, has retired from the Hollies due to personalcircumstances. Regarding the CD at hand, here's where the quality of their estimable output begins to falter. While the sound is excellent, the Abbey Road series passes over a few hits, contains unreleased material and intrductory studio conversation that those seeking a catch-all compilation may find distracting. But there are rewards to be had, and this second installment will leave even the casual listener wondering why many of these tracks were left unfinished or unreleased until now. It is safe to say, if you've purchased one of the series, you'll want all three, as there's no counterpart, in sound or variety, to the Abbey Road releases in the entire Hollies' compendium. END"
5,FANTASTIC,"ONE OF THE MOST FANTASTIC ALBUMS OF ALL TIME !!!..how wonderful to have one of my favorite old albums on CD, ...thank you amazon"
5,A must for John Stewart fans,"This album is a must have for any John Stewart fan, or fans of folk music. With the passing of John Stewart the folk music scene is not as full."
1,Disappointing,"Well intentioned, but disappointing book. I found the story too personal to be relevant, and the illustrations clumsy."
2,Disappointing,"As lesbian parents, my partner welcome any addition to the scant selection of books which mirror our family dynamics. The overall plot idea is original, but the rhyming/writing is so poor that I would rather read all the ""straight"" family books!"
4,swan princess DVD,"I have ordered this for my granddaughter who still has one on VCR cassette, she has wanted this for a long time and I just found out, so she is gong to be thrilled. Thank you Sue Munoz"
4,Swan Princess: Secret of the Castle,"For anyone who has watched the the swan princess movies and knows there is three movies total the way this movie is describede you may be mislead to believe it is a new movie, but the truth is that Swan Princess: Secret of the Castle is a dvd version of The Swan Princess II - Escape From Castle Mountain the sequal to the first movie which came out straight to vhs in 1997. The have simplely changed the name and the description a little bit. The new title fits the movie better then the old one. The movie is a good one and has some good music in it. As far as sequals go it is a good one."
2,This watch is not reliable,"I purchased the watch and wore it for about 1 year before the seconds hand actually fell off within the case. Prior to that it did not keep time well. This is the first watch I have ever owned where one of the hands fell off.I am a 32 year old male, I exercise about 4 times per week and never misused the watch. I do not recommend it."
4,An book about India by a misisonary,"Dear Ones is a book with a glimpse into the daily life of a family on a foreign field. Beginning with preparations to go, it tells the story of getting settled into a new home and new way of life in New Delhi, the capital city of India, in the year 1972. The reader is able to share in the excitement of foreign work, and is also given the opportunity to see the concerns, the sorrows, the burdens that are a part of the life families working in areas where the needs so far outweigh the laboring force. Local Christians and customs are introduced, and the book is illustrated in an effort to make the story vivid to the reader. It is our belied that those who read Dear Ones will finish it with a new awareness of the souls of other people and with a deeper desire to be used of God in sharing His truth with others."
5,Fantastic Updated 3rd Edition,"My approach to marketing was totally changed by reading this book; I was able to refine a jumble of thoughts into a clear, cohesive strategy. If you are at all exposed to marketing at work, Hughes will give you the ability to prioritize what is most important in your job.Hughes has just released a new edition of this classic. It is thoroughly updated to include developments of the last half decade (the failure of CRM in many applications, advancements in Web and e-mail marketing, etc). Every marketer and entrepreneur should read this book to learn how and why lifetime value is so important and how to build your company's strategy around it.The best thing about this book is that it covers the technical details adequately, but is still readable enough that you do not need an MBA to understand it."
4,"5 stars for the movie, but...",The separate DVD versions of these fantasic movies have both the theatrical and the uncut versions. Does the blu-ray version have this? If it does then this is a no-brainer purchase.
5,This is the way it should've been released first!,"Damn you Weinstein bros! I bought these 2 movies seperately then eventually bought this version, which is what I remember from the movie theater. If you don't like Grindhouse, I think it's because you just don't get it. I like the older flicks like Maniac, Zombie, House by the Cemetary, etc, you get the jist. The fake trailers, finally, they had been included in the packaging. This was just all around fun.At first, you might be put off at DeathProof but the more you watch it, it will grow on you. You'll pick up on the little nuances before it turns gonzo in the last reel. Before he gets to the last victims, it was actually fun to watch Stuntman Mike interact with his victims.Planet Terror, what really needs to be said about this, really? It's an awesome zombie/apocolypse flick and Fergie is looking as delish as always, Damn you Josh Duhamel!!!! And let us not forget, Cherry cuz she's just Cherry.Buy it, love it and rewatch it again and again."
1,Not the uncut extended versions -- BEWARE,Nothing wrong with the video or audio quality on this blu-ray double disc set. THE PROBLEM IS that both films are represented ONLY by their theatrical versions. If you have seen either of the uncut extended versions of the films then you will be VERY DISAPPOINTED in the versions presented on this disc set. Both films are included on disc one and some nice extras are on disc two. But the extended uncut versions of each film are so much better than what is offered here. Buy these films individually in their extended uncut versions. The same extras offered in this double disc package are also offered on the single film versions.
1,Say this is not true....Please!!,"Grindhouse was by far one of the coolest movies I have ever seen. I loved it from beginning to end.I have now found out that it will be released on DVD as two seperate films.That kills the whole point and takes all the fun out of it. Not to mention try to rip-off the consumer. These two films were released as one package and that should be the way the DVD is released. I want Grindhouse just the way I saw it at the theatre. If it is released as two seperate DVD's, I will not buy it.I will obtain a ""bootleg"" version of the way it was shown at the theatre.I think everyone should boycott it being split up and demand it be released the way it was originally presented.This is really a darn shame and a big disappointment. I even have heard that the trailers that were included in the film will not be on the DVD releases. Why? Grindhouse was such a great movie, why destroy it like this? This is a big freakin RIP-OFF!!!!"
2,Titanically AWFUL!,"The directors provide us with two long, boring features.Rodriguez's movie is all over the place, which would be fine if he had a strong story to underpin it. Not the case.Tarantino gives us not one, but TWO different groups of chicks having loooonnnngggg, pointless conversations about nothing before the real action takes place.The first 3-minute mock ""trailer"" at the beginning of Grindhouse is better than the rest of the following three hours.I'm assuming this was an attempt of the directors to spread their wings in different directions. I hope they go back to strong story-telling in their next endevours."
2,"Still No DVD Release? Shame on You, Tarantino!!!","I loved Gringhouse (the movie) and have the full length versions of the ywo features, but I've been chomping at the bit for the DVD release of the film as I saw it in theatres. To release it only on Blu-Ray is just plain MEAN! I don't want Blu Ray, as I have a huge DVD collection that looks & sounds great already. I would no more chuck my home theatre set-up and replace it with a Blu-Ray system than I would rush out the door to buy an iPod 4. The truth is, not all of us are made of money. Holding DVD player owners hostage this way shows me exactly the contempt and snobbery with which the makers and distributors of this film have decided to behave toward their biggest fans (yep, we actually love those lo-tech films of the past). Scew 'em."
2,NOT a collector's edition.,"Only the theatrical cuts, and for some reason they removed the Machete trailer? Fail. Non-buy. Make it the ultimate experience or stop wasting everybody's time."
1,DVD-standard audio,DVD-standard audio on a blu ray...why buy a blu ray?and if its about sounding bad to be in the spirit of the movie...then i want the bad sound uncompressed.companies like CRITERION release audio tracks of classic films in uncompressed mono sound...
1,Good movies - bad audio,"While the quality of the films is debatable and opinions will vary based on individual preferences, the quality of the audio on this relase is not up for debate. Blu ray touts high definition video AND audio, and for a manufacturer to not take advantage of the medias technical capabilities this far along in blu rays acceptance by the public is ridiculous. I personally enjoyed the movies, but cancelled my order when I found out that this was being released with substandard compressed audio. Send a message to Vivendi and boycott this release and demand a rerelease with uncompressed audio!"
5,Fantastic,"Mickey Spillane once said ""My work may be garbage, but it's good garbage."" That may best sum up Grindhouse, especially because many more sophisticated (and by more sophisticated I mean pretentious) will find the wonderful double feature from Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino to be just that: garbage. But to those who like a bit of grit, grain, and gore in their cinema, Grindhouse is a holy grail. The double feature is a loving, but highly original, tribute to the exploitation films of the 70s.The Bluray edition is absolutely loaded with wonderful special features showcasing the making of these action packed films. This is a must for any film fan that loves action, horror, and the cinema of the 1970s."
5,Perfect home release this time!,"I am SO glad that the company decided to release this movie the way it was presented in the theaters. I have been waiting to add this to my Tarrintino collection for a while now because I refused to pay $100 for the Japanese release or buy them seperately. To me this was one of the best films in 2007 without a doubt. Its a pity that too many Americans didn't take advantage and experience the TRUE ""Grindhouse"" old school experience of seeing two films for the price of one with fake commercials when it was released in the theaters. (it REALLY was a treat)This DVD gives you the closest experience to the theatrical experience that so many of you missed. I personally like Death Proof the best out of the two, but both films are really good! BUY THIS DVD...top notch Rodriguez and Tarrintino!"
4,grindhouse special edition dvd,"I found this special edition dvd to be pretty good,but i felt like it could be better...i don't know, but for me when i buy a 2 disc special edition i want the case and inside of the case to be special too.This one however is just an ordinary dvd case,it has no booklet, and i personally like when they come with a decked out paper sleeve to cover the dvd case and a booklet with information about the movie and exclusive pictures as well and this had none of that...but maybe thats just me..anyway the special features on the dvds are great and i think they can only be found on this edition of the movies..i myself had never seen these movies when they originally hit theaters so i had never seen them like this, with the theatrical cuts and the cool ass trailers between the movies too.I still would give this collection 4 stars and would recommend it to anyone who are fans of these movies."
2,"Finally Released, But With Issues","I was a huge Grindhouse fan when it was released, best 3 hours I has spent in a theater in years. Well, we all know about the DVD release, split up by the studio into separate packages. Here's where you need to make a choice: do you want the two extended releases with TrueHD audio, or the theatrical releases with only Dolby Digital sound, and the fake trailers? It's a tough choice but I chose the separate releases. To me, both stories seem more fleshed out when given their director's cuts, and the trailers, while entertaining, don't warrant a purchase, especially a double dip. There are several bonus features and behind the scenes for said trailers, but again not worth my money. It's a shame with movies like this and Kill Bill, that we can't get a definitive hi def release, when there are so many fans out there asking for them."
3,no HD sound holds this set back,"i was excited to receive this edition, so excited that i sold my other discs to a friend, which was a mistake. i am completely confused as to why they did not release this with blu ray audio. instead of using DTS master or Dolby True HD, they went with dolby digital 5.1. at this point HD sound is expected on blu ray especially from these great directors.the extra previews are great but i can't recommend this set to anyone who enjoys great HD sound from their movies."
1,Cuts out one of the best scenes,"Death Proof is one of my favorite movies, so I was stoaked when I saw this. I was livid when I found out that they cut out the lapdance scene. The whole thing!!!"
5,Awsome,"Love it, Love it. It shipped fast. These are awesome movies. Works great. Got them for a great price. Very pleased."
4,ALMOST perfect,"Well, it's here. YAY!! It has everything including the Machete trailer. My minor complaint is the sharpness here vs. the extended versions. They're a bit softer than the Miramax editions, and I suspect that's due to the 2 movies being on one disc, and having an audience reaction track on PT. We had one on the previous release, we don't need another one (I haven't played it on the new one, but fairly sure it's different since it's not the Extended version). That would have given more room for a higher bitrate, and possibly a lossless soundtrack. Colors and saturation are great otherwise. Rate it for what it is and not what you want. Want something different? Email their CS department. They don't pay attention here. Happy camper here."
5,The way it was meant to be seen!,"FINALLY! After three and a half years the complete Grindhouse experience is coming out (and in Blu Ray no less). I haven't seen this since the theaters because it's not TWO movies, it's one great EXPERIENCE!"
5,IT'S ABOUT TIME!!!,"though the two movies are great separate, the actual double feature with the fake trailers experience is so much better. I hope that they release it as an extended edition. if not ill still buy it."
1,448kbps dolby digital,"This blu-ray release has very low quality dvd audio.No HD audio.Barely better than mp3 quality.The separate releases DO have excellent lossless audio.This is absurd.I will not buy this.High Definition is about picture AND sound, & while some may say it's supposed to be bad,it's really not. The separate releases sound phenomenal."
5,Good reading,"An excellent, well-written, well-observed memoir of a medical man with a side interest in finance. Lloyd's background--English and American--and his own history (1930-on) qualify him to diagnose our time with accuracy and humor. You'll learn something about medicine and money too."
3,A technical reference,"While probably a good reference for the B-school student, and certainly factually accurate, this book is extremely dry, dwelling on the some of the arcane technical aspects of why these M&A; deals failed. Great for someone who structures these for a living, but not exactly a page turner for those outside of Wall Street.I felt it might have been more informative and compelling if there was a better discussion of some of the broader motives involved and more exploration of some of the interesting (and infamous) characters who were responsible for these failed deals."
3,mediocre and forgettable rock,"Not much to say about this band. The riffs are uninteresting, and the singing is ""sub-par."""
4,"Never got a ""true"" positive","These are good b/c they are inexpensive--much cheaper than store brands. However, I never got a ""true"" positive according to the instructions (I got kinda a half almost the same color as the control line and the other half was lighter). Also, I would recommend testing twice a day, b/c I would have missed mine otherwise. I got a negative in the late morning and then my weirdo half maybe positive at 530pm. I then used a Walgreens brand that a friend had gifted me to confirm the positive and that was a lot more definite positive. So I would use these again with a store bought brand as a backup to confirm. much cheaper to do it this way! And after 2 months now I just got a positive HPT 3 days ago! Yay me!"
4,Decent Purchase,This product was okay. The shipping was on time and the tests were individually wrapped. Its nothing fancy but I have been able to tell when I was ovulating every month. It can be a bit tricky but if you read the directions it should work fine.
5,Geat,"Awesome product, instructions and packaging.International shipping and it arrived on time as indicated!"
1,WASTE OF TIME,I TOOK THE OVULATION TEST AND IT WAS AUGHFUL!!!!iM OVULATING RIGHT NOW AND IT IS NOT SHOWING A POSITIVE....PAY THE EXTRA MONEY!ITS GARBAGE
1,These are junk!!,The ovulation strips are junk....either I got a bad batch or they are just junk!! I used them exactly as directions indicated...Exp. date is 2009 but I never got a reading with two lines....only the test line appeared.....I tested with a regular store brand and got a normal reading (LH surge). I will never buy these again.
1,Ovulation Test,I purchase the ovulation test but it was very hard to read because the purple ink would smear the strip so I couldn't get readable results...... I would not recomemend this product to any one.... Save your money and pay a little more for a better quality product....
4,I can only assume it works...,"I think this is a great product, because I luckily haven't needed to test it out. It has ample space to keep documents and jewelry in it, but it should be only considered for fire safety, not to keep the bad guys out. It's very mobile and if someone broke into your house, they could grab it in an instant. Plus, there is a little number on the front of the lock, that is you call the manufacturer with the number and get a duplicate key.Hopefully, I won't have to really use this product, but I am happy with the size of it and understand it's limitations."
2,All Wet,"I hope that when a fire strikes, and the the sprinklers go off that my goods will be protected. I am worried however because every time I close this document protector for an extended period of time, I open it to find moist documents. California is a fairly dry climate. I'm really not sure why this is happening, but I put my documents in a ziplock bag. Hopefully that will keep them safe from the safe."
2,Moist and Molded,"I've never tried out the fire protection on it, however, when I went to put in more documents in it today, everything was moist and molded!! I don't know what to do other then contact the manufacturer.... I live in TN and it sits inside our house that seems to be fine moisture wise."
2,Nice looking but cheaply made,"These products all seem like a rip off. Despite reading customer reviews, I purchased this changing table. Fortunately I have a very handy husband. One of the screw holes needed to be redrilled and there are two left-sided drawer rails on the drawer. Rather than trying to get the correct part from the manufacturer, my husband is just replacing all of the drawer hardware. Disappointing. The quality of the product is less than desireable. Disappointing considering the price. But it is nice looking."
3,"..., Workmanship and Quality Material is Lacking.","I have read the other reviews and agree that this piece looks nice.However, I too, had to re-drill many of the holes, due to misalignment and required depth needed for supplied hardware.It took me 3-1/2 hours to completely assemble.Poor Workmanship, in regards, to the machining and alignment of holes.Poor Quality, for almost {$$$)you would think this changing table would be all wood.Not true, shelving and drawer bottom is flimsy masonite-like material.I will also will definitely have to use some wood glue to make the drawer more sturdy.In conclusion, I don't think there are any retail baby changing tables that would meet my high standards.So I guess this one is o.k. based on visual appeal."
1,Not impressed,"For the money I thought I would be getting a really nice changing table. I was wrong. The drawer is impossible to pull out or push in without pulling the entire unit along and there were no instructions in the box. I had to go back to the store to get them. It wasn't too difficult to put together, once I had the instructions, but I plan on taking it apart and returning it as soon as possible. I can get the same inferior quality for a lot less money."
3,table is okay but company is terrible,We bought this changing table and a crib made by the same company. Our table also didn't fit together and we didn't get all of the parts in the box. We contacted the company for both this and problems with the crib and they are not easy to deal with. Every time I call I need to leave a message and then no one ever returned my calls. They do not take resposibility for flaws in their manufacturing. The changing table has been in good shape since we got the correct parts. You definitly need more than one person if you want a smooth assembly. The table is great but the company is terrible.
5,No problems at all,"We bought this changing table even though we had read several reviews claiming that it was difficult to assemble. Why? It matched our beautiful Babi Italia crib, it had a drawer, it looked and felt great in the store... so we took the chance. Although the printed instructions were a little quirky, the assembly was simple, straightforward, and took less than an hour from start to finish. I don't know if the manufacturer has gotten it's act together or if we just got lucky with this one, but our experience with this product so far has been flawless."
2,Looks aren't everything,My husband and I were really pleased with the quality of the product if we could put it together. The product came with NO directions at all. So we don't even know if we have all of the parts and if it is put together safely for our child.Besides that it is beautiful.
2,"Beautiful, but...","My husband put this table together in 10 minutes flat, then came the drawer...after over an hour, he finally gave up trying to make it fit. The drawer is going to end up being just a decoration with no real use whatsoever. The changing pad that it came with hangs over the sides, way too big. My last complaint is that the shelves are flimsy particle board. That being said, it's a very pretty table and looks great in my son's room."
1,"If you like wasting not only your time, but your money.....","We bought two different models from Babi Italia and both of them were frought with problems. The first one (Lia)had a broken slat/rail which had improperly drilled holes. This made it impossible to actually use the screws and lugs appropriately. We never got past step 1.The second model was the Lorell. The same problem ensued with yet more improperly drilled holes on several of the slats. Needless to say, we are making yet another trip back to Babies R Us to return this frustrating piece of furniture. No more changing tables for us as we're going to spend the extra dollars on a dresser/changing station combination. You may also want to test out these changing tables at the store as most of them seem very wobbly/unstable. You'd be better off purchasing something that you can use as your child grows since once their out of diapers, the changing table is not as useful."
5,Easy assembly for me!,"When I read the other reviews I was afraid that I would have to break out the drill and other tools, but I did not. Assembly took only a half hour and the directions were very easy to understand. Granted, I generally don't have problems building things. The only problem was that my belly often got in the way, other than that, the product was easy to assemble and is very sturdy."
4,Good starter legos,LEGO Lord VladekI have 9 and 6 year old nephews who I thought would love these. I had previously purchased the King Jayko for one and got Lord Vladek for the other thinking they could build them together and battle them. They seemed to enjoy them somewhat. Some of the pieces tend to fall off (mainly the shield) and the younger nephew needed help building his.
3,the making of a cello,"I bought this book to give to a friend for Christmas. He had just dusted off his Cello after 20+ years and needed some refresher info. Unfortunately, this was not the book for him. This is a book of esays about the history of and how to make a cello. It gives great detail in that aspect. There isn't really any included music or actual methods."
5,Provides Fond Memories of Our Trip to Italy,"This past summer, my girlfriend and I went to Italy as part of European Foodie Experience. We happened up Harry's bar in Florence. What we had there was par excellence. Yes, I know it is not the same as the one in Venice and with logistical issues we were not able to make it to Venice (Should have taken that train there instead of Pisa)... but we were, however, enthralled by the history and the the food that we had in Florence. Enough so that we had to buy the cookbook upon our return to the states.Next time we go, we will certainly make a stop at Harry's Bar in Venice to appreciate first hand the history and cuisine. But until then, this book will provide a reminder of what has been, what may have been, and what most certainly will be."
4,serves the purpose,"This is nothing fancy, but it holds a couple loaves of bread and a package of rolls and seems to keep them fresh for longer than not using it. It looks all right on the counter and doesn't take up too much room. I have not had any problems with it closing properly. Very serviceable. It looks best if you clean it with a glass cleaner or metal polish and rub it with a dry cloth."
3,Continuous hinge lighter than advertised.,"This hinge is Ok, but I certainly do not consider it to be ""Medium Guage."" I had previously bought one identical to this under a different label at Home Depot, but considered it too flimsy for the intended application. So I ordered the so-called ""Medium Guage"" one via Amazon. When it turned out to be equally light weight, I sent it back."
5,Great Kit - Great Price - Great Vendor,This is a super complete set of high-quality terminals. If you ever had to go to the hardware store to buy a few terminals for a project you know how expensive small quantities of terminals can be. This kit will meet most common needs at a price that's hard to pass upNorthern Tool does their typical excellent job of delivering a well packaged product on time.
4,Informative and Insightful,"This is a great book for delving into the myths, gods, legend and lore of Hawaii's people. For anyone interested in the deeper levels and meanings behind Hawaii's traditions and beliefs. As a student of the culture I return again and again to this book. It can be a bit dry at times, and is suited more for the student than casual reader, but is a great addition to any library."
2,Find an editor.,"I bought this book based on the many great reviews on Amazon. This was a huge mistake. There is most likely a ton of great information in this book, but it is so poorly written I don't know how anyone could ever glean anything from it. It all just feels unorganized, like receiving a lecture from a drunken professor. There are pages and pages without a paragraph break (though there clearly should have been many), the text suddenly jumps from authors thoughts to quotes from hawaiian narratives without separating them in any way (no italics, quotes, etc). I gave up before I made it a quarter of the way through."
3,Disappointment,"The book was somewhat of a disappointment due to the fact that I had already started ballet when I bought it. I had also already found out a lot of useful information on the internet. The target group of the book is adults THINKING of starting talking up ballet. The ""Ballet fit"" at the end was mostly a brief summary of what excercised that can be expected from a ballet class. Many of the movements are difficult to understand since there weren't enough amount of illustrating pictures. The pictures that are there are surely beautiful, but unfortunately, they have mostly used a pre-pro student in the center of focus and NOT real adult beginners (they are placed at the back). Which really doesn't give you any indication of how far an adult beginner can reach.If you are going to buy the book, do it for the right reason: As a motivation for starting classes and NOT a technical instruction book or ballet work-out book!"
4,Helped me be more confident,"I ordered and read this book before my first ballet class....at age 33. A lot of the ""ballet french"" and descriptions were over my head, yet began to give me an understanding of the moves I was going to do in class. What I found most helpful were the tips about ballet class...where to stand at the barre, what to bring to class and what to expect. It felt good going to my first class ever and not feeling completely unprepared. On a side note...the dancing community, from the dance store to younger, very experienced dancers and the teacher have all been very welcoming to a new, adult ballet student. If you've ever wanted to try ballet...you should go for it!"
2,Poorly edited,"This is an interesting topic, but rather poorly edited. The chapters are often choppy and the writing style varies widely from chapter to chapter. Some ""binding chapters"" would have been good; or some further editorial elucidation. However, many of the chapters are very interesting."
5,"... towards a new, sustainable Asia","This book focuses on the key issues that have to be addressed if the new millennium is to transcend the simplistic dilemma of Anglo-Saxon capitalism versus Asian-style development policy and create a new, sustainable Asia. The book is an interesting intellectual contribution to the evolving debate."
5,It is a terrific book for any serious reader of OS,I strongly recommend this book for any reader who is interested in understanding different components of operating system in general and WINDOWS NT in particular. Title is a misnomer. There more to this book than NT file system. It is a must read for graduate students who are interested in advance software design concepts. It will demystify design and interaction for different components of a complex piece of software.
4,Cat Nips,This is a sweet book. It's a different spin on the daily devotional books. Perfect for the cat lover who is looking for a little lift of their soul.
3,Very inexpensive but works with a few tweaks,This charger was really inexpensive and I'd also say cheap. It kept on coming apart and the spring inside would keep the center pin from contacting the 12v source. A little RTV in side to hold everything together and now it works well. You like to tinker and don't want to spend anything then this is for you.
3,Car Charger for Motorola V262 Cell Phone,"A little flimsy. Fell apart when I stretched the coiled cord a bit too much, but I was able to re-assemble to a working condition again. Still recommend as price was good. Just treat it a bit more carefully than I did at first"
1,the best available products to kill bad mouth,"this products are very effective, killing bad mouth in just second. whenever you are ready for an interview or a conversation, do not forget to take one"
2,Beware,"I didn't like it. I tried couple of times, but every time after use I had to cough several times as the effect this created in my mouth is so intense. So, beware of this product. It may be good or bad for you, but not good for me."
3,not as expected,"when we found this area rug after hundreds of others we looked at online we got really excited, it was just what we were looking for, it had an interesting design with great looking colors. on the picture, anyways. we placed an order for it and received it a few days later, in reality it looked differently. the colors were not as vivid, the white symbol was not standing out as it should have. it seemed rather dull. the area rug was returned."
5,Perfect little dressy watch,"I got this several years ago on Amazon (it was cheaper then, as well!) and I wear it a lot. I love the design: it's small and dainty, with just the right amount of retro flair. It's also versatile enough to work with casual and dressier outfits."
3,Not enough depth!,"What drew me to the book was the chapter on ISAPI filter. I found the coverage on ISAPI filter disappointing as it does not go deep enough. Furthermore, the code for the example presented contains glaring errors. I have tried looking for information on where I may obtain corrections for the code errors but cannot find any in the book or CDROM. The book has breadth but more efforts should be made to weed out error before release of the book. Anyway, still worth a buy for anybody interested in server side programming for the broad coverage."
1,Poor battery...,"The battery is really poor... From the words on the battery, I guess it is 1700mah, however, someone told me that it is 1600 mah. I compared the battery with the panasonic 1600mah ni-MH battery I got from [a retail seller]($[$$$] for 4 batteries). panasonic worked 5 hours and 45 minutes, while Millenium worked only 4 hours and 30 minutes. Poor battery! I will never buy batteries without capacity on its label. It is sure that the manufacturer is not confident about its capacity/quality."
3,Okay for little babies........,I bought this for my son. I thought it was a good product for a fair price. He has been using it for the past 8 months with no problems. But just yesterday I saw a sticker on the side of the strap that said the table had a 20 lb weight limit! I was surprised. My son almost weighs that and I don't want to buy another table now. Next time I will buy a more substantial one for more money that can be used longer.
3,Okay for the money...if you figure out how to put it together.,"My mother bought this for my third baby due next week. I have never had a changing table before, but we needed some extra storage space. The finished product looks okay, and is sturdy..but putting that thing together was a TASK!!! I consider myself pretty handy...but the directions were INCOMPLETE, which is the most annoying thing in the world. The holes in the top front bar were not aligned with the crossbar so we had to drill an additional hole to make it fit. I hate the way the boards sit on the side bars...there are no grooves to hold them. Again, it seems pretty sturdy...but the assembly was the worst do-it-yourself experience I've had in years."
2,Returning It To The Store,"We put this on our registry due to great reviews and because it claimed to be suitable for children up to 24 months. However, when we got it, it said the weight limit was 20 lbs! That's the average weight of a 9 month old! The shelves are *very* thin fiberboard, and are wobbly. We are returning this tomorrow.Perhaps their quality has gone down recently- most moms who reviewed it well bought it several years ago.Avoid this craptastic product"
3,Great if you don't use it much,"The top part of the table is sturdy, but I found I could not stack to many diapers on the plywood selves. The selves never seemed to stay in the grooves and the screws had to be tightened on a weekly basis."
2,It WON'T last!,"I received this as a gift. I liked the shelves, which makes grabbing diapers and clothes easy. Unfortunately, the back top piece came off after a few months. I glued it back to the spindles, but it still gave me problems. Then I am constantly having to tighten the screws as the table is not very sturdy. Better off investing in a dresser/changing table."
4,I love this piece of furniture,"I received this as a gift before our baby was born, and we love it. It is sturdy enough and I love oak, so I chose this along with the oak chest. It had plenty of space for everything and now that she is too big for the top to be a changing table, I just took off the strap and pad and the top holds lots of her pretty things and we put stuffed animals on the shelves. I would recommend it."
