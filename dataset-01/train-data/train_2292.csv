2,Deceptive Packaging..NOT Whole Wheat,"Ingredients are listed in the descending order, the highest % of a product is listed first. Therefore, if a manufacturer is claiming Whole Grain and Whole Wheat all over their packaging, they have no business making white flour the primary ingredient. Since they don't tell you the ratio, they can add as little as 1% whole wheat and still be able to put it on the outside that way.This is an extremely prevalent practice & needs to be regulated. Food companies are deliberately deceiving the public into thinking that they're getting something more nutritous than they are.Unless a package says 100% whole grain or 100% whole wheat (Wheat Thins & Triscuits have them), then they're likely not.I can't have white flour and it takes me forever to shop because all these companies have jumped on the whole grain bandwagon & are attempting to fool consumers and they succeed most of the time.Shame on Nabisco. And Old London. And every other company pulling this malarkey."
1,This is not what it claims to be,"I made the mistake to buy these crackers once and will never buy them again. I agree with another reviewer. These crackers are NOT whole wheat. They also contain ""ENRICHED"" flour."
1,Whole Wheat? Yeah right...,Read the label guys. ENRICHED WHEAT FLOUR - thats doesn't sound like whole wheat to me..
3,The proof is in the pudding..,"The title reads 38db gain, but the text says it has a 0-20 db gaincontrol. Shouldn't it have a 0-38db gain control. Anything to getyour money and at an inflated price! NO THANK YOU."
4,Lali Puna - Scary World Theory,"Experimental pop as only Lali Puna can do it. SCARY WORLD THEORY eases out of the gate with ""Nin-Com-Pop,"" which easily traverses the line between bucolic IDM and pop. ""Middle Curse"" starts with some glitch leanings, but quickly falls into line under Valerie Trebeljahr's understated vocals. The album as a whole is so quiet that you could almost forget it's on, but the gentle beauty of tracks like ""Contratempo"" insinuate themselves swiftly. For those who need more, ""50 Faces Of"" puts the percussion on a little heavier, and ""Lowdown"" goes full-on dancefloor. ""Come On Home"" pours on some moody breaks, and the brief final track, ""Satur-Nine,"" closes the album on a clarion note. Not scary in the least, if you ask me."
5,amazing album,"I bought this CD on a whim about a week ago, and it's some of the best music of this type that I've ever heard. It's heavily layered, electronica-influenced ""rockish"" minimalism (similar to Boards of Canada, Metamatics, etc., but with a softer touch.) The lead singer's voice is beautiful, and the tracks are wonderfully crafted. The lyrics are often dark, but are delivered in a disarmingly playful way.The title track is particularly good, but the album works very well as a whole. It's pop-ish and catchy enough to be comfortable for most people to listen to, but it's eclectic enough for serious music snobs as well. When I played it at a dinner party earlier tonight, everyone wanted to know what they were listening to; it was very well received."
5,This is one of a kind greatness,"Wall of Voodoo were like no one else. This is great music, but, to the unitiated ear, odd? Thats what made it so great. The creative percussion and vocal style made it seem like art created before your eyes. But man, you could really dance to it and fully let yourself go. ('Call box' sends me dancing in the dark........). 'Animal Day' is a great look from another point of view. They had to tone it down and get commercial for Mexican Radio, but this is the original, undiluated, creative one of a kind Wall of Voodoo. The LA punk scene was an awesome time. You should have been there. This album is one of my best memories of it."
5,an amazing recording,"WOV was much, MUCH more than Mexican Radio, or Far Side of Crazy for that matter. They had a number of awesome albums, and this is one of them. This was also their first full-length album, their other, self-titled EP which came out before this album was just as good with even more feel of youthfulness to it. check out everything this band has made, buy it all, you won't regret it!"
4,Voodoo's First Album,"If you can get hold of this rather rare album it is worth it. Of course you have to really like this band to fully understand & appreciate the type of music they performed in the 1980's. yes, the follow-up album with ""Mexican Radio"" was a big seller & is quite common on the second CD release but it toke this first waxing to get the band to that point. So if you like this band, really like them, you have to pick this one up along with the other Stan Ridgeway sung records. Search ""Judemac Forever"" on msn"
1,Terrible,I bought this after their Seven Days album (which I loved) and this is a real disappointment. More like a collection of silly beats and silly noises than music. Can't say there was a single track I'd ever want to listen to again.
3,i hope there is a season set soon,where the american godzilla had major problems this went a ways toward the original by adding the atomic breath. these are supposed to be the three best episodes a destroy all monsters homage. but i want them to release the entire series of which i have only seen several episodes of when it was broadcasted. i would also like some special features but not expecting much in that category based on other godzilla releases.
2,Only for young kids or fans of this series,"Since it's now common for an entire season of a TV show to be released at once, it's pretty surprising that this release is only 3 episodes (and with a total running time of barely 60 minutes). Apparently these 3 episodes were chosen due to popularity (and similarity to the 1968 film ""Destroy All Monsters"") but if you aren't already a fan of this show you're going to be hopelessly lost, since these episodes come from the middle of the first season and make a lot of references to things that happened previously.Due to the few episodes and the lack of any setup or introduction of the characters, this DVD is only going to be of interest to people who were fans of the original cartoon or to very young children who'll probably enjoy seeing the monsters fight each other (but may be very bored by all the human ""drama""). Ultimately this disc seems like a quick attempt to capitalize on the upcoming 50th Anniversary of the original Godzilla."
2,"Good Show, Bad Feature","I'm a fan of the animated series. This, sadly, is a horrible take on it. I would definitely buy a box set of the show. This, on the other hand, is pretty much crap. I liked their version of Mecha Godzilla and their aliens were ""different"", but it was barely a Monster War. Yes, it had many monsters. But the thing is, they didn't do anything. The bat monster was neat, but only him, Godzilla, and Mecha Godzilla even battled. Don't waste your time. Look for some of the ""Godzilla: The Animated Series"" videos and skip this DVD."
4,Speaker stands,Speaker stands are easy to assemble and handle my Polk speakers very well.The stands are easy to adjust and look great.
3,Mostly good,"1. Even though it says 'stand' in the product description, it is 2 stands in the box.2. The compression nut that screws down to immobilize the top half is plastic. Should be metal. Be careful screwing down too tight or you may strip threads.3. If you have Bose speakers, they will not fit with the attachments given. You will need to go to a hardware store, buy 3"" brackets & a round file. You get the idea ...4. Base and bottom half of stand are fine.Very disappointed in the compression nut. Otherwise fine stands, if you do not have Bose speakers."
3,Don't be fooled by the photo in the product description,"This item's description shows a picture of speaker stands with grey poles, but the ones I received from Amazon were had black poles. I am impressed with the product, but if you're looking for Sanus's grey poled speaker stands with a black base, then you won't find them here despite the photo in the product description. I am happy to report that after I brought this issue up to Amazon, they responded to my satisfaction. It will be interesting though if Amazon takes the time to correct this photo error or if they will continue to use this misleading picture? Time will tell."
4,Very Pleased!,"First and foremost I was very pleased with Amazon's service via third party provider with One Call. The Sanus speaker stand(s), by the way came in a pair, is sleek/modern and stylish with a very sturdy base stand. It was shipped promptly and in a very compact box. Very easy to set up with clear easy to follow instructions and the need of a phillips or flat screw driver. Came with 3 different possible speaker mounts. Only precaution is to gingerly screw in mounts to stand. You will not be disappointed!"
2,Item took forever to get and came it a beat up box and slightky scratched,I ordered this item and it took forever to get it. It came it in a beat up original box with no real protective extra packaging. The instructions were not very good and the item was slightly scratched and it some spots looked like the paint had been touched up.The item worked for my speakers but if it didn't take so long to get I probably would have returned it.
3,"Nice departure from the usual non-believer flicks, but could have been done better.","A sweet, touching story that includes turning to God for help, which we see too little of in movies, but a rather sophomoric effort in terms of writing and editing. The acting was mostly good, and Kristy Swanson very engaging. My husband and I watched the whole thing, and both of us were moved by it."
5,"The search for The Good Witch, 4 & 5 of the series","The Good Witch. Please see above. Sometimes I find that some additional info, such as complete title, actors or release date to aid in finding what I am seeking. Generally my contacts with Amazon has been excellant. Thanks, DMKarr"
5,Love the family atmosphere,I love family movies I can watch with the whole family. And this really fit the mold. It is a thumbs up for our family.
5,Fave Hallmark Christmas movie for the 2011 season!,"So heartfelt & touching, we watch this 1 yr round too if we just need some ""soul food"" & are having a bad day, feeling blah or down...it helps me feel reassured that there are still loving caring people left in this world that are willing to give of themselves to make a difference in others' lives..."
5,Dont Give Up!,"I caught this movie on tv right at the end and couldnt find it listed again. So I checked Amazon, it was good price so I ordered it ,here in two days, and enjoyed it very much. You wonder how this woman can keep going when everything goes wrong. But happy story with happy ending who could ask for more."
2,Not that good...,"I've read most of Serviss' work and this in my opinion is his worst. It has a lot of amazing imagery and fascinating ideas, but in the end it feels rushed and overly clumsy with Serviss grasping desperately to try and make everything tie together in the end."
3,Worth reading but not spectacular,"I love Simak's books; but this was not my favorite. It's been a while since I've read a Simak book so I was psyched when I found this in a used book store. It's got the Simak feel to it; it has the Simak trek. It just doesn't have a sense of direction; the plot was too nebulous. It was still a good read so by all means give it a try, especially if you are a Simak fan."
1,This book is awful awful awful,"This is the absolute worst book I have ever read, bar none. The spelling is atrocious and the grammar is sub-third grade. The ""story"" (such as it is) merely lists the ""author's"" complaints regarding her co-workers and supervisors in the video replicating business. That's right, the video replicating business. There are many, many petty squabbles going on, none of which are interesting or even about the porn industry. It's like sitting next to a person who just complains constantly about how horrible their job is. Here is a sample of the bad writing and trivial complaining, from page 33: ""In the office Clinton had a national sales manager, John. He was a wolf in sheep's clothing in many peoples [sic] mind. He was the most dishonest and back stabbed [sic] person around. John talked **** about people a lot, every body [sic] was ********, ***** or other cute names he used."" This is a terrible, terrible book."
2,What the -- ????,"Not only is this book vindictive and petty, it is also boring. Not only is this book vindictive, petty and boring, it is so poorly edited that if I had a dollar for every glaring grammatical or spelling error on its pages, I'd be able to afford a lot more books on the same subject that are much more informative and entertaining. Interestingly, I noticed on the inside cover that my copy had been revised. Why did anyone bother? DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY OR YOUR TIME!"
1,The Game is sold not Told!,"This book reminds me of a poorly written romance novel it has great intentions but the end result is ones unique experience at love gone wrong. There were periods when i thought the writer would give a indepth view of the adult business but it kept within the conservative confines of ignorance especially when the writer lumps a entire race of people together just because of one individual, what would you expect if you knew that a large percent of your co-workers were addicts. and the world you revolved in was shady."
1,loosing time & money,"You can save your money on this one.Basically, here's the story of a woman who gets a job as an editor and has trouble with her boss, who's far from being a role model. But the fact is that she criticizes the business when she even tries to get in it as an independant producer.This book is her revenge. But don't expect any juicy gossips or pornstars/backstage descriptions or any kind of pop-cultural reflection.Not even entertainment you'll find.You'll start reading it. you'll be passing pages expecting something to happen. it never happens. Book ends. bad luck. money is gone."
5,Straight forward...,"This author does have the last word, it does seem to some previous reviewers that they do not like the authors last word. One can not always please all readers, but it pleased me. I think that the midas touch has suddenly been broken for the company owner, and everything will eventually come back tenfault. You can learn from the book many more things than just how the adult film industries components work but also how the minds of the people that are involved works. The author has taken her revenge in exposing a very greedy producer, but also how not to do business and always treat others the way they want to be treated them selves. It is clear that the owner has no respect for him self that is why he does not show respect to others. This book is a form of payment for not respecting others."
1,Mildly Retarded 4 Year Old,"The positive reviews on this book are clearly written by the author or her friends. The book is extremely poorly written, being full of basic grammitical errors and incorrect spelling. The story is really a non-event about a women spending 2 years and 7 days working in the back office of video porn distributors. About her working long hours and being ""good"" at her job. It came across as a big complaining session about her former work collegues. I say ""who cares""! The book was simply painful to read. A mildly retarded 4 year old could have done better. All I have to say is don't waste your money on this book."
1,Like watching paint dry,"This is, without a doubt, the worst book I have read in the last two decades. The author seems to be functionally illiterate, and the subject matter is just plain dull. The book apparently went to press without the benefit of proofreading, much less editing. Furthermore, I am convinced that the few positive reviews that appear below were written by the author's mother (or, perhaps, the author herself). In short, if you are considering buying this book, save your money, unless you are seeking a surefire cure for insomnia."
1,not a good drill,"The drill I received was not the one pictured. It also did not work. The forward/reverse/off switch was broken. I returned it. Even if the switch had worked, I was not happy with the quality of the drill. It looked cheap."
3,"good power for the price, not a long life, though","For what I paid for this tool, it worked well. For about 6 months of fairly heavy use. Then it died. Probably a good tool for the homeowner/ hobbyist who doesn't abuse their tools as severely as I do. You won't find anything better for the price (I paid $70)."
1,Arrived defective,"I ordered this drill as a Christmas present. My husband had requested this particular drill. When it arrived, the mechanism was faulty (so much for ""factory reconditioned""). It was a pain to have to mail it back to Amazon (although Amazon made it as easy as possible, did not charge postage and notified me when they credited my charge card).I would NOT purchase this item (at any price)."
1,worst ever,"I own over 20 exercise videos and this is the worst of them all. Alan Harris won't stop talking and his moves are ultra simple, uninspiring, and are too slow for aerobic conditioning, plus it only lasts 20 minutes. The rest of the cast are dull and show no personality. It is only good for the landfill."
3,Great product except for the buzz,"It is nice and compact...so much better than the always tangled ear bud cord I have always delt with. The winder seems pretty study and if the shaped ear piece fits your ear you will never want to go back to the cheap foam-covered round ones. The only complaint, which is a pretty major one, is that people I talked to sometimes heard a loud buzzing sound that I could barely hear. It only occurred when I used the Jabra ear bud, but I don't know if my earset was defective or there was some compatability problem with the Nokia 3595 I have."
3,Not what I expected...,"I purchased this because we loved Ten Little Ladybugs, and thought this might be a good bedtime book. The pictures are fun and nice to look at, but the rhyming in the text is a bit forced and doesn't have the rhythmic flow that Ladybugs does. There is also a grammatical error that bugs me- ""Eight wishing stars and this sheep's in heaven he wished for chocolate cake, and now there's..."" and the next page says seven. Now ""there's"" is the equivalent of ""there is,"" and it should be ""there are."" It may be insignificant, but it bothers me. I have to say I was a bit disappointed. You can probably find a better bedtime book. I really like ""Time for Bed"" by Mem Fox."
4,And it glows in the dark,"Ten stars that glow in the dark. Charming drawings, and it glows in the dark. Amusing verses, and it glows in the dark. Very calm for bedtime, and it glows in the dark. The story isn't terribly memorable or profound, but it's cheerful, and it glows in the dark.Note: glows in the dark."
3,Just OK,"I got this book for my son (who is almost 2) since he really likes stars and counting. He doesn't seem to be that interested in it though, maybe there are too many pages or words, but he doesn't sit still for all of it. I'm not too fond of reading it either because it just doesn't seem to have any flow. The pictures are cute, but that's about it."
4,It Does Not Stink,I personally do not think this stinks bad. To me it is a heavier yet fresher Tide smell. My only complaint is that I didnt realize the bottles were so huge. I had to get a funnel and pour some into a smaller bottle since I have to tote my clothes to a laundromat. Otherwise I now have enough Tide to last me for at least 6 months if not longer. It was a great deal.
1,Skin Reaction,"I tried the Tide Febreeze Sport HE and it irritated my 2yr old's skin. He broke into a rash and was itching everywhere. The rash looked like a bunch on mosquito bites. He had patches all over. I had to give him an oatmeal bath and then the rash disappeared. It was definately the detergent as it's winter time, we don't have animals and the only difference in routine was the detergent. This was just last night, now I have to go home after work and re-wash all our clothes. Ugghhhh!"
5,TIDE WITH FEBREZE,"I'm so glad that this item was offered at such a great price! My son is allergic to the dry powder detergent, so I chose to use liquid Tide. And, this one with the Febreze is wonderful. I put a shirt on today that was washed in it, and I continue to smell the Febreze even now! Love it! Thanks again."
1,How did Febreeze become so popular?,"I just visited my mother, and due to working in her garden, I had to wash my clothes with her bottle of Tide with Febreeze. I am home now and the clothes are back in my washer, and I hope that I can get that sickening smell out of the fabric. Quite honestly, the reaction I have to it is quite visceral - I want to run outdoors and away from that sweet, pervasive, overpowering, creepy odor. I can't imagine what it must smell like on top of cigarette smoke, flatualence, cat urine, or whatever people think they are covering up. Arrrrrgh."
2,Just a bluish tinted bulb,"The bulb is small and provides light output that exceeds regular bulbs 5 times the wattage. The Daylight aspect of it is definitely not desirable. The light has a bluish tint to it that makes it seem to be not as bright as a similar bulb that is not a Daylight bulb. It makes you feel like you're in a utility room and not in a warm, inviting, place."
5,Fantastic,"As with every other release he has had, Andrew Bird absolutely nails it in this album. From great catchy beats in Skin Is My and A Nervous Tic Motion of the Head to the Left to the beautiful sweeping melodies in the untitled tracks, this album is near perfect."
5,Andrew Bird is the Best,"My friend told me to listen to Andrew Bird. I've been hooked ever since!!! There is one one else like him. His music is intelligent, but he keeps it light with his beautiful violin playing and fun whistling. Mr. Bird is a musical genius, and deserves more praise and publicity then he gets. I had the amazing opportunity to see him play in concert. All of his albums as great, but to see him play live is memorizing."
5,we'll give you a complex and we'll give it a name,"After Amazon recommended this album to me repeatedly, I finally caved and gave it a listen.I found something so ridiculously quirky and happy and melodic and... almost cute (but in a good way) And I couldn't stop listening.Seriously. Listen to ""Nervous Tick Motion Of The Head To The Left"" and then tell me you don't like it. And if you don't, well, I don't like you.I love his voice. I love it all.Best tracks: Masterfade, The Naming Of Things, Skin Is My, Measuring CupsHell, just listen to them all."
5,one of my all-time faves,"This CD blew my socks off. It is one of my top five of all time, hands down."
4,An enlightening book about the Kurdish Diasporas,"I found this book extremely interesting and helpfull, as I am writing my thesis about Kurdish immigrants and refugees in Europe. It includes an introductory section about Kurds and their situation in Turkey, Iran and Iraq. The comparison between the two refugee communities in England and Finland was very informative."
4,Another valuable preservation,"More big pop hits of the 1900s (see also ""The Man on the Flying Trapeze"" in the Classical section) by the Robert DeCormier Singers and Ensemble. Excellent sound and arrangements. Of special interest for popular music historians who won't find much of this material preserved elsewhere, or as well."
3,Puzzle of the USA,I ordered a different puzzle from the one I received. It was ok but not the one I really wanted. It served the same purpose as the one I ordered but it had to be assembled on the floor or on a table. The original one was already in a border-type frame which was what I was looking for.
5,GREAT TODDLER BED,THIS IS A GREAT TODDLER BED MY GRANDSON IS 2 YEARS OLD AND HE LOVES IT IT WAS EASY TO PUT IT TOGEATHER
3,No Drawer?,"My bed was missing a drawer! That was one of the features that helped me choose this bed but atlas, it was missing. The instruction manual didn't even have the slightest mention of a drawer, not even in the diagrams for setting it up. Everywhere online that sells this bed describes it with a drawer and even shows pictures of it. Reviews even praise the drawer so I know that there must be one. Contacted Amazon and we resolved the issue. It's obviously a manufacturers problem.Besides the missing part defect, I really like the bed. It is sturdy, the rails are the perfect size to keep my son in the bed w/o being over barring like his crib was becoming. Looks more modern in person with the right bedding and setting. Looks a little ""country"" online.My 2 year couldn't be happier with his big boy bed and has had no problems sleeping in it through the night.If we received the drawer, I'd of given it 4 stars."
4,Works well,"This cabinet gives ample room for most homes structured wiring needs. It is fairly sturdy and offers you a selection of external covers to mount, ranging from simple plates (with screws) to polycarbonate doors. The unit shipped with ample packaging from buy.com (unlike the steel door cover, beware!) so it arrived in one piece and all the necessary fasteners were included.I would add some other components to the buy list, such as a duplex outlet, an external cover for it (because it will hang outside the enclosure), and the bevy of mounting hardware that channel vision offers.What makes this product less than perfect is some of the channel vision design choices that I scratch my head over. For example, they include trim rings for the knockouts, but none of the trim rings allow you to attach standard 3/4"" tube connectors to the cabinet. So you end up with very large holes all over the place, which I consider less than ideal. But other than that, I liked the enclosure."
2,The vermeil was very poor,Although the bracelet itself is well made it has such thin vermeil that it wore off after a few days of use-now I have a silver bracelet that was sold as vermeil.
5,A single voice for many...,"Christine Lavin may be a ""Single Voice"" but this album speaks for many! With keen insight, wit,and the most impeccable comic timing, Christine does it again! This ""Live"" album contains a mix of what makes Christine Lavin one of the best live folk perfomers today. Christine presents the complexity, sensitivity, and humor representative of today's woman. Treat yourself to this album and discover the pure pleasure of a complex woman who says it all!"
2,What was she thinking?,"I love Christine Lavin--I'm a fan. But this album is a dog. Her patter just isn't funny. The songs aren't funny. Do you really want to hear Christine trash Monica Lewinsky? Me neither. Versions of ""Harrison Ford"" and ""What was I thinking"" are better on other albums. And the touching songs just struck me as corny and preachy. I still sniffle every time I hear ""The Dakota,"" from an album of yore. This isn't in the same league. I hope this is an aberration and Christine isn't losing her touch."
3,This is to be a child's game?,"The game play is good and is reasonably easy until you get to the one section with multiple flying predators. The ammo runs out to quick and the targeting stinks. Even when the target shows red the weapon doesn't always hit the mark especially if the insect is too close. We had to quit since the game was becoming too frustrating and the ant bully kept expiring becasue of the multiple stings and there is no way to get away from them. The any bully kid can only climb and most of the time he can't jump so you can't jump and try to attack the flying insects so if you can't hit them with your weapons they just keep coming back to sting you. If you want to make a game for kids then please make the game so that there are different modes like easy, medium and hard!"
3,Ant Bully the movie not the game!,"This game is commen , not very fun and controles are extremily touchy the game is not for true gamers but maybe for beginers .I am Disappointed with Nintendo not the quality hard cores are use too."
3,not for beginners,I was a little disapointed as I was brand new to beading. This book was a little complicated. It probably would have been more helpful to look at after I had taken a few classes to understand it better.
5,Simply the best of the best,"The Viola Sonata, op. 147 is Shostakovich's last and best work. It may well be the best work ever written by anyone. Freed from any lingering desires to please anyone but himself, Shostakovich composed the type of music a dying man writes when he knows he will never hear it performed: simply, direct, passionate, sincere. Having op. 147 brilliantly performed is reason alone to buy this CD. Throw in the amazing partially dodecaphonic Violin Sonata, the Cello Sonata and the two trios and you've got one amazing deal."
3,PE Test Review,"I've used this book to study for the PE test. While the content is pretty comprehensive, I have problems getting over the blatant typos and misprints. Many equations have sign conventions wrong and some are written just wrong. So, if you have a good background to spot this sort of thing, by all means go ahead and use this material; otherwise, consider this purchase carefully."
3,"movie not bad, dvd release ok","The movie is really not bad. Michael York, William Marlowe, and the german actors like Elke Sommer and Peter Carsten are great.The picture quality of this Warner Bros Archive DVD is good (of course, restored it could be better)!! Also missing subtitles. Just the price - its to expensive for no subtitles etc."
4,Surprisingly good,"I was very pleasantly surprised with this movie. The ""cartoonish"" cover almost put me off but I'm glad I went ahead with it (picked it up on sale for a lower price than here.)A very young Michael York is the hero who braves being branded a traitor and lands a ride on the German warship. At times, it almost reminded me of early James Bond movies: the hero ""captured"" by the villains and forced to accompany them on their mission of destruction. (I even half expected to hear the classic Bond music when the action really got going.) The special effects were pretty decent too. Considering this was made in 1971, it's actually held up pretty well--better than many other, more well-known 70's movies.If you can find it on sale or in a bargain bin, pick it up. It's honestly not a waste of a few bucks."
5,A Childhood Favorite Revisted,"This was the first movie I remember seeing at the old theater in my home town when I was 6 years old. A lifelong love of airships was born out of this great action movie, along with becoming a Michael York fan, a sucker for a beautiful Fraulein with a Bavarian accent, among others. Roy Budd's memorable score, along with the fantastic opening theme, are among the highlights of this WW1 adventure. If you love action movies, WW1 era airplanes, or just a nearly two hour escape into a story that critics have described as ""Jules Verne Meets James Bond"", this is your movie!"
5,Great Movie,"This movie lags a bit in the beginning but if you give it your attention, the pace picks up and it becomes a very good story. The acting and special effects are excellent. I highly recommend this movie if you are into the Hindenburg Disaster or you just love zeppelins."
3,Brief study of the kingdom of God,"This book is primarily written to be used in a classroom setting with study questions following its brief chapters. It's primary purpose is to show how one can apply God's instructions (i.e. the law) to modern day situations. In the process, the author briefly expounds upon what the phrase ""Kingdom of Heaven,"" may have meant to those individuals living in the time of Christ. This book is extremely short and can be read by most in one setting (It took me about an hour) so don't expect an extremely deep work. However, it certainly is worth reading if you are looking for some supporting reading about the Hebraic roots of Christianity."
4,Alien Reality Show Targets Earth,"An alien reality show, Plunder That Planet, has targeted Earth for the next conquest. An evil alien queen plans to locate the planets sexual nexus and drain all of the sexual energy from the planet. The nexus seems to be somewhere in a girl rock band that likes to take off their tops. But the girls don't like being a target and fight back.Goofy MCs, Evil Tyrants, The Bimbo Limbo, special effects, and lots of bare skin await in the science fiction spoof of reality television. Special appearances by Julie Strain and the Porcelain Twinz.This disk is packed with plenty of extras including the usual picture gallery, deleted scenes, and more."
1,"PG-rated ""porn"" is an excellent description of this video!","This DVD was not erotic, instead offering lots and lots of sophomoric, unfunny humor. Yeah, I suppose there's some female nudity involved, but whoever put this thing together completely lacked any kind of talent and/or creativity, or maybe it's just that they didn't want to make the effort. The potential was there to produce something campy & fun, but it sadly never happened. Call this one a waste of a good cast! Not worth even a rental!"
4,The Airline Training Pilot,"The Airline Training Pilot is a comprehensive reference handbook for contemporary airline pilot training and it is of valuable assistance for anyone involved in modern airline pilot training. The book emphasises a strong focus on human factors and soft skills required for airline pilots and instructors alike. Thus it is in my opinion not only a good reference for flight instructors but also for the sophisticated airline pilot who wishes to review or expand on his/ her communication and leadership skills.I find the chapters dealing with the ""basis for good instruction"" and ""training objectives and methods"" of great assistance as these chapters incorporate good insight into pilot assessment and effective training methods.The Airline Training Pilot is a well written book with a ""hands on"" approach to modern airline pilot training."
4,"A harrowing, haunting experience in the supernatural","With a sophisticated but uncomplicated writing style, Kate Stewarts novel, The Devil's Cradle, is an experience I won't be forgetting any time soon. The theme is fascinating, the characters are realistic, with the atmosphere being both rich and dreadful. The action starts quickly, but takes its time in the telling, building up a wonderful atmosphere that grabs your brain and squeezes it silly.Anyone interested in horror or the occult will most likely dig this offering; give it a chance if you run into it. It's worth it."
1,Morse watch review,Just bought this watch and what a dissappointment. I was a ships telegraph operator for 15 years so I know morse code very well. The visual display was very difficult to read. The audible sounding of the time was barely audible. I had to put watch next to my ear to hear it. The speed of the morse was about 10 words per minute. Overall very dissappointing. Its going back today.
4,A mixture of good and so-so,"This album has a few songs that are very well known, a few not so well known but enjoyable, and a few that are forgettable. Joan Morris is outstanding in this kind of repertoire, although she is not in her best voice in this album, and even misses a couple of notes. William Bolcom, her composer/pianist/husband provides his usual, strong accompaniment. Robert White seems more at home in some pieces than in others.Overall, this is a nice diversion when you are tired of the real classics. But it is not a blockbuster album."
5,Gentleman Bronco,"I wasn't to crazy for Napoleon Dynamite and Nacho Libre, but this movie is hilarious. As a wanabee film director I can relate to this movie and its makes me laugh to tears."
4,4 Stars for Rockwell.,"If you are a fan of science fiction and fantasy, enjoy an odd sense of humor and happen to like Sam Rockwell, you may very well appreciate this movie. I was looking for an easy, feel good movie to watch and this fit the bill perfectly.While the movie isn't great as a whole, certain scenes standout and it has a specific, underlying charm to it. It has a fair amount of potty humor without being overtly vulgar, which is becoming increasingly rare these days. Here is a movie where the alienated underdog wins and youthful innocence and dreams prevail....The scenes with Sam Rockwell are great."
5,Insanity at it's funniest!!!!!,"So you thought that piece of crap ""Nacho Libre"" was funny?, you don't know funny, first, there was barely anything ""normal"" about this movie, nothing!, it was out side the box folks! out side the box!, it was played to be as ridiculous as possible, and it succeeded. the cast was perfect, Jennifer Coolidge just keeps getting better and better with every film she makes, Michael Angarano, Jemaine Clement and Hector Jimenez are also perfect in the roles they play, this is a movie that is going in my collection for sure!"
4,But it has flying deer! Shooting missiles!,"I don't care how bad it might have been, it has flying deer shooting missiles! What Merchant & Ivory film could not have been improved with flying deer shooting missiles?Seriously."
3,Strange Ranger,Pretty weird movie...but something I would expect from the makers of Napolean Dynamite. Worth the $6 i paid.
3,ANOTHER QUIRKY COMEDY FROM THE MINDS OF NAPOLEON DYNAMITE!,"Napoleon Dynamite was one of those films you either loved or hated and I imagine this film will be greeted with the same drastic opinions. While not as good as Dynamite, I did enjoy this film and the cast of quirky characters. If you're a sci-fi novel reader all the better, but even non-readers with a sense of humor should find enough here to keep them entertained."
5,Very funny!,"After seeing Nacho Libre and Napolean Dynomite, I wanted to see this as well (same directors). Kind of zany, and very funny and well executed. Loved the ending!!!"
1,The worst ever.,The worst movie ever. My IQ decreased by 30 points after i saw this awful movie. It is a real disgusting.
1,A very annoying film.,"I guess Salt Lake City was ""lucky"" enough to be one of the few venues they tried this film out on. My brother, a huge Napoleon Dynamite fan was very excited to see the film, so against my better judgement, I went. Trust me, as I am not a huge Napoleon Dynamite fan, this film is nowhere as interesting. The best part, in fact the only part is the Dr. Ronald Chevalier character. He at least has some of the quirkiness and novelty the main characters in the other movies had. The only feeling after this film was an overwhelming sense of being annoyed by the whole thing. I am pretty sure the other four people in the theater had the same reaction."
2,Movie froze up quite a bit,When we were streaming the movie it would freeze up and we would have to start the movie over. This occured several times. It was kind of disappointing.
5,"""Oh my holy crap, surveillance does... I hate those.""","It always baffles me when I read 1 and 2 star reviews of movies like Gentlemen Broncos by people who clearly are not the intended audience.This movie is quirky, crass, awkward, and totally ridiculous so my nephews and I loved it. (They're 7, 10 and 14 years old.) They quote it all the time and I can't help but laugh with them.If you're expecting some stellar, intelligent comedy, this isn't it. But, if you don't take life too seriously, if you love Sam Rockwell, Jermaine Clement, and Jennifer Coolidge, this movie is worth your time."
3,OKAY MOVIE,"I found this movie too silly, bordering on stupid, with a lame storyline. However, it is somewhat entertaining as you get through it. I read other very good reviews for this movie, I guess it depends on what you're looking for. I knew nothing about it and bought it on a friend's recommendation. I would not recommend buying it. Look for it at your library if you are curious enough to want to see it."
5,Just Watch It,"It's so good. And silly. If you were born from 1970-1985, you'll love it. Also you must have a sense of humor."
1,I only laughed once in the whole movie,"I loved Napoleon Dynamite, and enjoyed Nacho Libre as well, however there was a good reason that this film went straight to video. I could relate to the awkwardness of the characters in Napoleon Dynamite and Jack Black made Nacho Libre work, but there is nothing to relate to in this film, I just sat and waited for something funny to happen, only problem was nothing really ever did. However if you look in the toilet before you flush and it makes you laugh then you will probably enjoy this movie."
1,Insanely Badainous (sic),"The Chevalier character was great. Original, well acted, funny, etc. Everything else about this movie just didn't work. I really wanted to like this movie, but it relied far too heavily on the awkwardness of it's characters and crude testicle, poop, etc references to elicit a laugh or two from the audience.There's not a whole lot to say about this one. Any attempt at originality is so poorly executed that it renders this film unwatchable."
1,Horrid movie,"I did not like it at all, it was really slow and completely stupid humor. I am a fan of Napoleon Dynamite but its obvious this was just made to get money off of the hit."
1,"""Gentleman Broncos"": The New ""Zontar""","We selected this movie a couple of weeks ago for one of our neighborhood movie nights and now, our neighbors are still not returning our calls. It is a noxious mix of adolescent fantasies and tired cliches spiced with disgusting special effects (Bronco puke). I can't comment on the whole movie because we shut it off after the first thirty minutes in order to save lives (ours). I have always thought that ""Zontar, The Thing From Venus"" was the worst movie ever made but ""Gentlemen Broncos"" has issued a strong challenge for the title."
1,Xanadu has a new friend!,"I wanted to like this movie but I've just finished watching it and now when I talk about bad movies, I mention Xanadu AND Gentlemen Broncos. The only funny parts were in the blooper reel. It just wasn't funny. There's nothing else to say that some other one-star review hasn't mentioned."
1,Full disclosure recommended:,"This DVD is substandard for its' cost. It seems as though the DVD was recorded from a copy of the original version taken by the viewer as they watched it on a screen. The picture is difficult to watch, making you dizzy at times, many distortion lines running through the production and the picture is often off the center of the screen. I do not recommend the purchase."
2,Huge Disappointment,"If this video didn't have a few minutes of Ethel Merman singing some of her signature tunes (""Blow Gabriel,"" ""You're the Top,"" ""Anything Goes"") this would be a total waste of time.HUGE sections of the play (including subplots and songs) have been cut to fit into the tv time slot - and, Frank Sinatra is miserably miscast (though sings beautifully). Oh. And the film is grainy and dark.Worthy only as a curiosity.(2stars in stead of 1 because it IS fun to watch Ms.Merman)"
2,A modernist twist on French Horn playing,"To begin, I have to admit I found the title of the album misleading. Instead of a mellow, Bach-like baroque deployment of the French Horn, I found myself surprised that it is accompanied by piano, more along the lines of a sort of bawdy Gilbert & Sullivan or Gershwin play/musical score.Trying to find anything I like or find suitable on this album... maybe it reflects a lack of good material for the French Horn. I don't know. But it could only have been cooked up by someone who loves this instrument.Solid 2 star rating.Ken Cybulska"
5,I love it,"I am a Romanov buff myself since I was in high school, when I first heard of the family in a history class. I have read since as many books on the Romanovs as I can put my hands on. And I absolutely love this one. It is not a scholarly work like Massie's, but the intimate details of the family are wonderful. I especially liked the fact that you come to know the kids better, their individual personalities. I still smile every time I read that Maria signed her letters as ""Mrs Demenkov."" I have read and looked through this book about a hundred times already, and I am still as fascinated as I was the first time"
5,"The Romanovs: Love, Power and Tragedy","This is a beautiful book with an abundance of photographs. As a history buff with special interest in the Romanovs, this will make a welcome addition to my collection. Unfortunately I haven't been able to read the entire book as yet but I know I have hours of great reading ahead of me."
5,Did you know?,"Did you know they used information and pictures from this book to write the movie ""Anastasia (1997)""?"
4,Nice Firewire-only CF card-only reader,"I own several CF card readers, and this one is pretty much the same as all the rest (size, shape and functionality.) I believe it is a little faster than USB, based on the articles I read, but the nicest feature is the hinged cover that protects the card slot from dirt and dust, especially while travelling. It is sturdy and should hold up well even packed in a suitcase.My laptop only has the 4 pin firewire plug (not self powered) so the Lexar will not work with it. If you have the 6 pin firewire plug the Lexar will work just fine for you.Remember, the Lexar is firewire only and it only works with CF cards."
2,"old technology, compatibility problems","Does not work with newer (2008) Sandisk Extreme III cards. Also has problems with some types of much older cards like Kingston Elite Pro cards.Otherwise it's a decent reader, very small and compact, but with the compatibility problems and it getting so long in the tooth I would avoid."
3,"FW Reader, 400 not 800","I've been using the Lexar Firewire Compactflash Reader for about two months and i've not found any faster upload then what the SanDisc USB reader gives. The Lexar works fine and is easily transported but it does require a powered FW port and, most importantly, this is not a FW 800 card reader which would be significantly faster then a USB reader. And, sadly, no where in the seller's info does it indicate which FW reader it is so i only found out as i went to connect it the first time and as all my FW inputs are FW800, an adapter was needed and not furnished. So, the reader works fine but if you are expecting faster downloads, you'll have to go with the SandDisc Extreme FW800, a considerable more expensive reader."
2,Doesn't work well with Snow Leopard,"This device doesn't work that well with Snow Leopard. There are some tricks to making it work, but they seem a bit convoluted. Even when I did get it to work, it wouldn't work through the powered hub on my Cinema Display, but only when directly connected to my Firewire port on the laptop. Overall, I would say that it would be better to get a newer device or use this only if you don't plan to upgrade to Snow Leopard."
5,Speedy Reader,This is great for the Mac users among us that may not have a USB2 port yet. Trnasfer over USB can be very long this reader takes care of that with its Firewire capability. Well constructed comes with a cable. Works great for me for use with my desktop or portabe.
5,works like it should,"firewire transfer is fast and stable. no complains from me, but I'm on a word counter so I have to keep typing. Done."
2,It works but it's not worth the price (view comparison below for better alternative),"So i bought a Lexar and an Esecure All in 1 mini card reader. Today i received both and put them to the test.TESTTransfer 4 mov files that total 877mb. Here are the results.CF Card used Transcend 600xLexar (FIREWIRE 400)test 1 = 00:00'58""3test 2 = 00:00'58""4test 3 = 00:00'58""3Esecure (USB 2.0)test 1 = 00:00'27""1test 2 = 00:00'34""2test 3 = 00:00'26""1I was a little disappointed that the Lexar took longer because i expected it to be faster.Lexar - CF cards ONLYEsecure - 150 different cardsLexar - Expensive (approx $45)Esecure - Cheap (approx $10)The size of the Esecure is smaller than the Lexar.WINNER ESECURE ALL in 1 by far. Recommended by me.I'll update review if things change as far as malfunctions and durability.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003CKC8W8/ref=oh_details_o06_s02_i00Hope this review was helpful."
1,No customer support from Lexar with defective card reader,"I bought the Lexar reader from a Lexar dealer and when it arrived it was defective. I sent it to Lexar for a replacement and they sent me another defective reader. I phoned and spoke with someone in tech support and they said that they no longer had new units to send out, only ones that customers had returned."
1,WARNING FOR POTENTIAL BUYERS!!!,"This card reader is only advertised as a generic ""firewire"" reader. I received the product only to find that it utilizes the old firewire 400 technology, not firewire 800, the current industry standard, in so far as commercial television and film production are concerned from a media management standpoint. These inputs are no longer featured on current model macbooks. Beware before purchasing! Bought my 13 inch Macbook Pro earlier this year and this card reader is not compatible with it! Thanks for specifying Amazon! Enjoy my $40!"
3,Tiger Woods,"Fun to play, item as described. Gets kinda boring after season is completed. Achievements to easy. ! ! ! !"
5,THE GREATEST FEMALE ROCK BAND IN THE WORLD,"Without a doubt, this is the best Go-go's album. On this album, the music and the songwriting is more mature than the two previous albums ""Beauty & the Beat"" and ""Vacation"". For me the best cuts on this albums are ""Head Over Heels"", ""Beneath the Blue Sky"", ""Forget that Day"" and ""Capture the Light"". If you're looking to buy an album by a group of really hard working women, this is it, nothing comes better than the Go-Go's. Charlotte Caffey, Belinda Carlisle, Gina Schock, Kathy Valentine and Jane Wiedlin are indeed THE greatest female rock group in the world. Forget the Spice Girls and any other girl group like them, THE GO-GO's are the real deal."
3,"Better than ""Vacation"" But Flawed","The final Go-Go's album of the 1980's was a good but not great collection of edgy songs that played to the strengths and exposed the weaknesses of this great all-girl band. Part of the problem here is Belinda Carlisle. A decent singer whose range deepened later in the 1980's, Ms. Carlisle has never written any of the songs she sings and therefore she can't connect with the material as effectively as say...Stevie Nicks or Natalie Merchant. The result is that many of her performances on ""Talk Show"" are too similiar and lacking emotional punch. The three singles: ""Head over Heels,"" ""Turn to You,"" and ""Yes or No"" are the best of the songs by far."
2,"Lovely soprano, but...","Heidi Grant Murphy is truly a soprano with a very lovely voice, but is this enough for this music? With every new recording of the famous wedding cantata the very first aria will tell you if the recording is worth listening to. And to be more specific: Do the soprano and the oboe sing their melodic part as if they'd rather be without the other or do they sing it as a duet?On this recording Ms. Murphy does not seem to approve of the presence of the oboe at all; ""keep quiet and let me sing my part!""If you want to know what I am talking about just go to Elisabeth Schwarzkopf's recently issued 1958-performance with the Concergebouw and Otto Klemperer. But do not blame me if you never listen to ms. Murphy's recording thereafter."
1,"Oh, where to begin...","I really had high hopes for this book. So little substantive is available on the career of Simon & Garfunkle. Unfortunately, this childish, fawning tome is almost a waste of time.It's so hard to determine what the author had in mind. Certainly not the music of this duo. She spends more time on a plot synopsis of an Art Garfunkle movie than she does IN TOTAL on the creative process of the duo's groundbreaking albums. How they made their records, how the songs were created, life on the road - very little on their art is discussed. That seems not to be important to this amateur author.Since she had such access to Garfunkle, that must be why the focus is on Artie-minutia (and then she should have called it that!). But if one wants insight into the actual career of this duo, to learn about their music, their muse and their legend...look elsewhere. Lord knows where that is..."
2,Dropped the ball,"There are too many factual errors and fan-mag platitudes here to make this an authoritative biography or analysis. Too bad, since the subjects are such interesting people with such interesting careers. Look elsewhere."
5,"A ""must"" for all Simon & Garfunkel fans!","Victoria Kingston's engaging and informative biography of one of America's most popular duets is a seminal history of the Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel collaboration. Victoria Kingson has created a biographical work of painstaking attention to detail and accuracy. Candid, comprehensive, insightful and poignant, Simon & Garfunkel: The Biography is a ""must read"" for all Paul Simon & Art Garfunkel fans, and a very highly recommended addition to personal, academic, and community library music history and biography collections."
4,where is dean cawdor?,"Where is Dean and when is someone going to reunite him with the gang? Why can't Doc and Jac have girl friends or one night stands or something? Wish I could write.......I have ALL of both Deathlands and Outlanders, and have enjoyed everyone, but would love to see a bit more human emotion from the main characters. Don't want to see them become more machine than human like Mack Bolen. (The first books in that series were just great!!!) I'm sorry I don't know the authors, but really enjoyed Shatter Zone. Keep 'em coming guys."
5,Beauty in one of its purest forms,"Claire Voyant have been one of my favorite bands for about two years now. Their debut certainly has an underlying layer of darkness to it, but on the surface it is a dreamy, smooth and entirely addictive set of soulful and passionate tunes. The mood changes from one track to the next, though never too drastically.It's hard to describe the music using genre, however. The band describe themselves as Dream-pop, but I find the name misleading. Mix ethereal, light rock and a dash of darkwave and you get... Claire Voyant. Amazing vocals, beautiful sounds and smooth composition. Highly recommended work.Highlights: Heaven Knows, Her, Aqua, Land and Sea, Fear.Morning Comes is the only song I routinely skip."
3,"Good, but not great....","Mike Thaler did NOT illustrate this book. Since his illustrations are so good, Mike Thaler books are rarely very good unless he drew it. It's still a pretty decent book, though. So I gave it three stars. But if you want a REALLY good book by Mike Thaler, buy 'Never Tickle a Turtle', 'Soup With Quackers' or 'Funny Bones'."
4,For dog lovers,This book made me laugh and cry. I have 2 cats and a dog andcould related to the writer. It was a good read.
1,"If someone had bothered to proof read, I may have given it 2 stars",I was annoyed by how shallow the writer seems to be. I have always rescued dogs and cats. I even volunteer at the local shelter. NYC may be different but all of the crazy dog ladies I know (myself included) don't care what the breed is. We also don't spend alot on unneeded items. I buy functional collars and donate the rest to the shelter.
3,Would have been a MUCH better read with the help of an editor,"This book was a good, heartwarming read for dog lover's. Makes you think about rescuing your best friend instead of buying one, and of how you CAN reform 'bad' dogs with a lot of love & patience. BUT, the typos are EXTREMELY distracting. At 60% of the way through the book, I started highlighting, and it wasn't pretty. WHY do publishers thing it's okay to release e-books without proper editing? It's insulting to intelligent readers."
4,"Great story, needs proofreading","I loved the story of this rescue dog. Having 2 rescued furbabies myself, both having some socialization issues in the begining, I found this tale endearing and lovely. The author proves to others that the work you put into a shelter dog is returned ten-fold. I did find lots of typos. Author should spend more time proofing."
1,Went on forever,Way too long a read. While some parts of this book were funny in that NY cynical style of humor . The majority of this book it felt like the author kept repeating the theme.
3,"proofread, proofread, proofread!","As the ""mom"" of 3 rescue dogs, I enjoyed Wallace 's story, and his evolution into his new life. I could certainly relate to him. However, the constant typographical errors drove me so batty that I couldn't finish the book. (FYI, I would have given it a higher rating, if not for all the typos). Publishers: PLEASE proofread the Kindle books just like you do paper books! Thank you"
3,Kindle Edition Needs Proofing,"I'm not a dog person or a New Yorker. This book still made me smile.I think I would have enjoyed the book more, if there were fewer errors. The Kindle edition badly needs some proofing. My rating is based on the story alone."
3,Who let the dogs out --- woof-woof!,"If you are a dog lover you will just enjoy reading about a ""Super-Duper"" dog lover unless you consider your dog the only dog that matters.There are a lot of valuable tips to train a dog along with all the reasons you should seriously consider before getting a dog.I picked up a few phrases in a foreign language which I will be able to use in the future.This was just a fun read."
1,Automatic lens cover problems galore!,"My ownership of this camera was brief. First, you must know I love Nikon. I have 2 other Nikons--an old Cooplix 2200 and a Coolpix 5700. They have wonderful lenses and give great pix. I thought my experience with this model would be similar. NOT!~ From picture numero uno, the lens cover refused to completely open and cooperate. I got pictures, yes, but they had lazy black eyelids on each corner where the lens cover had not opened up to clear the lens. What a dissappointment! I traded it in for a Canon A520 and am happy with that camera. I suppose it is just what it is. If I'd saved and spent a lot more money on a D50 or Rebel, who knows? Anyway, that is my sad tale with the Nikon 4800."
4,Good Camera for the $,"I bought this Nikon 4800 last month(NOV)for my trip to Disney. It took great outdoor pictures, inside some pictures turned out blurry. The battery life is very good. The in camera redeye reduction worked pretty well. The menu is very easy to navigate. My main reason for buying was the 8.3x zoom, it worked great. Overall I'm very pleased so far with the Nikon 4800."
5,Wonderful Camera,"This is a great camera with many options and settings to take wonderful pictures, indoors or out. It has more optical zoom than other cameras in this price range, adding greater resolution to enlargements."
2,quick but seems to be missing some parts,the camera came quick but there was no battery charger in the box so I can't use the camera without the charger. only complaint
2,Great if you like noise,"I ordered this camera before I read the review on www.dpreview.com. After reading the review I was a bit worried but I thought, ""Who cares about noise, I take slides with Ektachrome 400 which has tons of grain (ie noise)."" When I got the camera, I took some test shots and compared them to my 3 year old 2Mpixel Fuji 2600 zoom. I'm sending the Nikon back. It's absolutely unacceptable. Any dark area on the picture is filled noise. I even forced it to use only ASA 100 and it looks like ASA 4000 or worse. The electronic viewfinder has a lag, especially if you have the lense extended. The build and quality seem OK but the pictures just don't make it."
1,Short battery life !!!!!!,"I've had this camera for about 2 weeks and have taken 97 pictures. So far I've had to charge the battery 8 times.(Have to charge the battery every 6 - 10 pictures.)I even purchased an extra battery locally thinking that might be the problem. Did not remedy the situation. I have a Canon G5, a Panasonic DMC-FZ1, and an Olympus 750 (all great camera's)and the battery life on these are at least 200+ shots. I am returning camera for refund. Other than the battery problem, this camera takes great pictures. Probably just got a ""lemon""."
4,"Excellent Pictures, excellent Camera, Great Zoom","I bought it mostly for the optical zoom, I can't complain about this, it is very good optical zoom, good macro, EXCELLENT pics without flash, very sensitive ccd, even without tripod. Easy to use. I used it for 3 consecutive days with LCD ON all time without charching battery. Great to have internal memory in case you can't afford an additional memory. Only problem is that doesn't work as a webcam or as a live camera connected to a pc, for video capturing, :(. NIkon review this please."
4,Smoked Out Hiphop,"J-dilla and Madlib come together for the first time to bring us a collection of dusty, funky, and raw Hiphop gems. Js lyrics are pretty average they revolve around the same kind of subject matter as QUASIMOTO. Musicly These guys have been digging deep within the crates for only the finest Hiphop selections 95% of this CD is great it lags toward the middle and end but this is okay by me because most of the songs are dope. In all It looks as though J-Dilla and Madlib Have a bright future in store and I am looking foward to see what future projects they collaborate on. 4 MICS"
3,Not quite Champion- Split Decision Sound,"To me, this album doesn't compare to Welcome 2 Detroit, but it holds it's own. This album has it's ups and downs, but when it's up, it's TIGHT. I was excited to hear J-Dilla's beats, not knowing much about MadLib, or that they spit over each other's beats. Although J-Dilla is no SUPER MC, I like his verses. It seems he's just spittin' off the top of the head. To quote: ""& who said producers ain't supposed to rap/ they don't want the Ruger to bang & close ya trap"". And we can't forget about MadLib's ad libs as Quasimoto. This album could've been better, as it DOES sound ""experimental"". But that's what makes in more interesting than all the other VANILLA PUDDING POP TART CRAP that's out today. IS DILLA EVER COMING W/ A FOLLOW TO 'WELCOME 2 DETROIT'?"
4,not bad atall,"well this album has some hot ass beats. A couple of my favorite tracks are ""Starz"" and ""Strapped"". Strapped is, in my opinion, one of the hottest beats i've ever heard, to be honest with you. The best part about this album is Guilty Simpson, on ""strapped"". this dude has some sick lyrics ya'll, cop the album simply for my man's Guilty Simpson. the beats are tight, the rhymes are so-so, but J Dilla is much better than Madlib, he needs to stick to producing, holla."
2,This album doesn't cut it,"I was looking for some super dopeness when this one dropped - I mean MadLib and Jay Dee on the same album? I put out an order for it right away but couldn't stand more than 3 listens. The rhymes, as the Amazon reviewer points out, are pretty whack and the music just doesn't flow in that Classic laid back way you want it to. No joke, 'Lib and 'Dee are mad talented, but drop this one in the long column of super-groups that didn't deliver."
1,i couldnt even give this album two stars,"this album was so weak. I expected to have another good duo by madlib but was left unninterested by the whole album. All the songs sound the same and have that bootleg quality; the songs are fuzzy and have very lame bass cuts. I was suprised by the fact that jaydilla rapped little and when he did, it was not very impressive. Probably the most unimpressive thing on this album, were the lacking beats. It seemed that madlib or jaydilla was not trying very hard to make this album a sucess; i expected more from jaydilla on the cuts. A very poor effort."
4,Piggy Back,"First of all I dont really do the review thing but maybe it need to start. Im so late on this because i was just surfin around and saw people, who seem to be down with the BBE/ST movement, dissin this album. WTF!!! Are u that ignorant that u cant see that these are two of the best producers in the "" real Game "" havin some fun. These cats got together and was like yo, u hot, im hot, lets make it hot. Mcnasty filth was one of the hottest songs performed live at the shows ive been to. And the official is beyond hot. Yall who dissin this album need to stop tryin to get a job with the SOURCE and come back to the real hip hop. its LOVE. and my man who said to pick up that j-88. ""U know what love is"" so start spreadin some."
5,it was a gift,sent to my mother in michigan and she loves it. hers was lost in a house fire. thank you much
2,Large Print a Hoax.,Not nearly large enough print for what is needed for my brother. Very disappointed;.Pages so thin print shows through from other side making it even harder to read. Ugh.
5,Joe's the man,"Joe Pass, in my humble opinion, was one of the greatest jazz guitarist of all time. His blend of rhythm and melody are just amazing. I have all his DVD's so I may be biased but you will not be disappointed."
4,"A great, quick read!",This was a very enjoyable story. The feelings that the author portrays and the questions that she evokes were poignantly laid out. It was a quick one day read and I very much enjoyed it!
5,"This book was soooo good, it made me cry.....",Books that make me not want to put it down are really great!!! I cried lots during this book and I think its top!!!!
4,An Irish Leprechaun,"I read this book about 5 years ago, and I have still thought about it. I don't think I fully understood what was going on. But now I have!! I liked this book and you shoutl read it if you find these reviews intresting."
5,Great Book!,I read this book many times and I loved it more every time! I think that everyone should read this book because it is really good!
5,Jazz guitar,"Excellent cd with greats jazz musician and with the unique style of Mr. Garrison Fewell. Nice selections of tunes, if you like Wes Montgomery style this guitarist got it all together. Clean sound, smooth solos, and his improvisation on the guitar very tasteful."
3,Slightly above average,"The Line 6 CrunchTone is a decent pedal. I own a Pod amp emulator from Line 6 and like the variety of large tones I can get with that, but don't have the foot pedal option and wanted something simple to use playing in a band setting. There are obviously far fewer tones in the single pedal, but additionally the tones are a little disappointing. A little cheap sounding. Not terrible, just nothing to get that excited about."
4,"An unusual, compelling story..","Patrick Schnerch has created an unusual, action-filled story with a rare blend of character-study and suspense. I like novels about serial killers, and once I started reading this one, I couldn't put it down. But it's much more than a story about a serial rapist and killer on the loose. Adrian, with his mental problems, is a fascinating, likable character. The reader will experience the story vividly through the mind of this mentally disturbed individual as he works his way through all the clever twists and turns of the plot."
2,Poor Man's Brain Academy,"Except I don't know that it is actually cheaper. Brain Age and Brain Academy are much better games with much more variety. The story that is offered up doesn't add anything to it. There are only four different types of challenges (remembering a sequence of pictures shown, counting how many bouncing balls, adding several numbers to find the sum, and finding the two identical pictures among a group of singles). While they are different than the challenges found in the other two games I mentioned, they lose their appeal. There are four levels of difficulty for each game. They could definitely have a better way to keep track of your progress and your improvement. I haven't tried the Gamma Wave version of Brain Boost, but it looks to be as simple and lackluster.I'd skip this game and opt for the Brain Age and/or Brain Academy! I may have rated it three stars, but considering these games are available, it can't compete."
3,Brain Boost Games,"My granddaughter who is 8 found these games to not be as good as other ""brain"" games I have purchased for her."
4,good,"This game is okay, cartoonish, but fun, only 5 or 6 (games) subjects and mission to complete. I haven't completed a mission yet, but I'm still learning the game. I'm Older and My eyesight isn't what it used to be so reading glasses are a must. Some of the items I just can't get past, but I bought it for fun - not to earn a degree!!Brain Age (1 & 2) are better, tho they have drawbacks too. But I still have fun with it."
4,and Mom likes it too,"Actually bought this for my mom who is 73. It can be a bit addictive when challenging yourself for a higher score. If you liked Big Brain, Flash Focus or Brain Age then you'll find this is similar in style. Shape recognition and sequence remembering are part of the challenges. Easy, Normal and Hard difficulty ranges helps you build your score. I think any age would find this a fun past-time game. Play each day and you will really see your score grow which apparently means your concentration gets better."
2,Brain Boost: Beta Wave,"Good price for the product. I thought it was going to be different, but I think it serves its purpose.."
3,YES!!! but no...,"This stuff is great on plastic and is satisfactory on rubber. Leaves everything nice and black.Leaves absolutely TERRIBLE residue behind though, no matter how many towels you use to rub it out. I won't buy it again because I know theres something better out there..."
5,GREAT BOOK!!!!!!!,This book is about a little old lady named Miss Marple who sits around and listens to people try to solve mysteries. Everyone thinks she is really quiet and dosen't really know what's going on. Boy are they in for a surprise!!!!!!!! I really liked this book beacuse it is mystery and humor mixed together.
4,I like it.,I like Jane Marple and her folksy wisdom. I had read most of the stories but not all of them and this seems to contain all of them.
5,Miss Marple Short Stories,"Quick response, book in good condition. there was a printing defect with the book, but it is still OK."
1,Not as advertised,"My rating is not based on Agatha Christie's writing (Who am I to knock Edgar Alan Poe's literary daughter?), but of the misleading listing. I purchased this edition for my vision-impared mother, because the vendor listed it as ""large print"". It is not ""large"" enough for a reader who needs LARGE print."
4,Harper and Collins,"The only criticism I have of this book, as it is otherwise completely entertaining, is that there are pages missing. Not that it skips from page 156 to 164 but that there are probably two pages of story line missing from 156 to 157. I'm just issuing this as a warning to anyone who purchases this edition. I will contact Harper and Collins and let them know about this as well."
4,Miss Marple: The Complete Short Stories,"Excellent as with all of the Miss Marple stories by Christie. I was disappointed a little because I thought I was getting a collection of Marple stories I did'nt already own. In fact, the book begins with the Tuesday Club Murders (which is already on my bookshelf). This was an error on my part because I should have checked the book out in more detail before purchasing. Still, a good collection to buy if you don't already have the stories in separate books. Besides, we Christie fans never tire of rereading about the exploits of her most famous detectives."
5,Awesome,"I purchased this and Spawn: Bloodaxe 22 without ever even having heard of the whole Spawn thing, and I have to say it was a purchase well worth it. The detail and craftsmanship are exquisite. These toys are obviously not meant for young children, even some older women I know got scared when they saw these toys. I heartily recommend this to anyone who's interested in toys of the Spawn genre."
5,Spawn rides high,"This is a great addition to the world of Spawn action figures. Great detail adds wonders to this already great pairing (Spawn and the horse)...The horse is beautifully painted and holds it's own against the horseman of death. I just can't get over how great everyone of these pieces looks. Big ups to McFarlane for continuing to impress. The removable helmet was a nice touch...first he's a viking, second he's a skeleton (sort of)...it's just really great work."
3,Madeline and her trusty dog Genevieve save the day,We love the Madeline books and this is a solid take off. The 12 girls enter Geneivieve in the all Paris Dog show. Confusion ensues because Genevieve is a mut. Spunky Genevieve and Madeline save the day. Strong girl role models.
4,Genevieve the wonderdog,"The resident dog of the old house in Paris is Genevieve. She can sing, dance, and an assortment of other amazing feats. Miss Clavel and the girls adore her, so it's obvious that she must be entered in the Paris dog show so they can prove she's the 'most wonderful dog in the world.' Unfortunately, the other contestants' owners don't think she should be entered because she's a 'mutt.' My daughter loves this as much as the other Madeline videos, but I gave it four stars because the music and story isn't as fun as ""Madeline's Rescue"" and ""Madeline and the Bad Hat,"" which are my personal favorites."
5,Out of print tips... hard to fi9nd,Bought as a gift for my family who just bouight a house in the Florida Keys. Retro book. my sister in law loved it.
4,Satisfied Customer,"This camcorder has some nice features including a powerful zoom, automatic exposure, automatic focus, and a 720x480 video resolution. Though the camera dos not work well in low light conditions, the camera can be operated of the AC power supply, and a high capacity 3.7 volt 2400mAh battery can be purchased at: [...]This optional battery will double the record time of the camera."
1,useless studs,"The backs on both of the earrings were severly bent. After filing a complaint, they sent me a return shipper (they paid postage) and my account was given a full refund for the purchase including shipping. they were just as I expected, but the backs were just bent beyond use."
3,Not a good introduction to these historical events,"This book is interesting and definitely addresses the events of 1989 in a real-time manner, but you really need to have a background on the events before you read this. The author jumps right in with details, assuming you'll know what he's talking about and providing little additional background."
2,felipe dylon,"Hi! Yes, Felipe Dylon is a Brazilian singer, but i dont understand why he has to copy other people's songs! he is very very very good looking (in fact, i met him last week for the first time in person) but when i bought his cd, i didnt realise that his looks were as far as it goes. well i like only one song of his, but it was sung by someone else already. He does have a voice, but i'm sure it'll get better after he grew up a bit more, after all he's only 17, right? you enjoy more if you get his dvd :P"
2,A dsappointing boook by a great Justice,"Justice Musmanno played an impportant role into the Nurenberg trial of the nazi criminal. I was expecting some insights about some of these cases into this book.The reading of this book turned out to be very frustrating as it only deals with topics which, for sure, weighed much less in Justice Musmanno's life and have nothing to do with World War II.Is it due to my own frustrated expectations or to the content itself? The finding of this book, after years of search, and its reading turned out to be very disapointing."
2,To the Kid who's a master,"Just because you were the first blader doesn't mean your a master, how do you even know if you were the first blader, i started beyblading there are kids around the whole world, when i was 3 and only collected dranzer and driger blades, i have 2 dragoon blades too. I have the metal series dranzer, driger and dragoon. This stadium can only fit my metal series blades (i have 18 and it only fitted 8). This stadium is kind of fun, but its not fun for my blades, i gave it away to my cousin. This isn't worth recommending. i recommend the dragoon staduim, it can fit up to or 6 blades and you can have a battle royal or a team battle. I rate this 2 stars.(...)"
3,Not Worth it.,This stadium is not so much smaller than the regular and does not store blades all that well. Your better off risking a break on your five dollar stadium than investing in this one.
4,Beyblade mobile stadium,My 8 and 6 year old love to battle with this toy. My only recommendation to the toy manufacturer would be to redesign the storage compartment. The larger beyblade tops do not fit for transportation.
4,Great portable stadium,"My son has just recently gotten into the BeyBlade craze, so this is his first stadium (I purchased it for his birthday). It is made of a fairly sturdy plastic, and sets up easily. My 7 year old set it up for the first time by himself. It is rather noisy with the tops, but provides a good arena for them, and he can fold it down and carry it around with him. All in all, a good product."
2,Five Year User,"I have used this software for editing and burning for the last five Years. Recently I downloaded a revised version of it to find it no longer usable for my purpose. Before hand when editing the cursor remained where you left it when stopping the recording. With the new version the cursor returns to the beginning each time, causing to lose your place in the edit. I was told by product support this was necessary to make it compatible it other programs.This is another example of programers that have no hands on experience with their own software, but rather modify perfectly good programs in order to create and promote new whisles and bells."
3,Nuclear Enchantment - work of Patrick Nagatani,"Interesting but not up to the standards of Nagatani and Tracey's collaborative work. The art is still interesting enough for enjoying, but not enough to keep on the bookshelf."
2,I like Celine Dions version better,As you can see on my rate of this CD I dont like it very much. And as I said before i like Celine Dions version better. I think you all know wich version I mean: My heart will go on from the moviepicture Titanic. Please write an e- mail to me if you have the same thoughts about this CD!
3,Complicated Rating System,"Useful to find locations and get ideas, but the rating system is a pain to read - Ratings with five different numbers plus three symbols - kept me leafing back to the front more than I wanted. OK, it keeps the size down but is somewhat ""clumsy"". A worthwhile effort, but with room for improvement."
4,A nice Victory debut for The Forecast,"To be blunt, this cd is very suprising, and very good. I basically bought it after hearing only two songs (These Lights, and Fade In Fade Out). I wasn't exactly sure what I was getting, but I'm glad that I got it.So take my advice: Get this cd. Put it on, grab a beer, and chill out.Standout tracks include: Seating Subject to Availability, These Lights, Late Night Conversations, and probably my favorite of all the 6 minute Exorcise Demons."
5,Fantastic band and album,It's sad that the 2 One stars even are able to use a computer. This album is so beautiful
1,LOSE THE GIRL AND YOU'LL BE FINE....,"Alright....sounds like every other emo-rock band that's out there today, EXCEPT they have a female vocalist that makes Karoke Night seem appealing. She sings like a 4th grader in the school chorus....Sing louder than all your friends so your mom can hear you is MUCH cooler than actually singing well. Buy this album if you need a good ear-bleeding. It is a shame because the rest of the band has a decent sound, then they let her sing the courus and your brain melts out of your ears all over your new shirt. So what it comes down to is that you just bought a CD that you are not physically capable of ever listening to again, and you gotta buy a new shirt. Do the math."
4,A Fun Song Collection,"I was pleasantly surprised by the songs on this record. The notes say that Youmans' career did not last very long. The lyrics are sometimes a little corny and overly clever in their rhyming. Overall the songs sound very nineteen-twenties, very tin pan alley. But I found the songs and performances a good deal of fun, with excellent and spirited vocals and piano accompaniment."
3,A little review,"Vincent Youmans was a great popular-song composer of the first half of the 20th century. When his widow was moving house to Florida, she donated a stash of acetate discs (of her husband recording/composing at his piano) to archivists.Some of these unknown songs appear on this CD, as are many lesser known compositions that this under-rated composer had laboured over.Despite the fact that this CD is just 2 vocalists and a piano - a treasure trove of songs await you!"
5,Toddler bed,I bought this bed for my two dogs. I wanted a piece of furniture rather than a dog bed on the floor. This is a perfect solution and my dogs love it.
1,Cheap Cheap Cheap,"No, not cheap cheap like a baby bird. Cheap cheap as in worst than that mid-90's ""European furniture super store"" cheap. The back board you see in the picture was broken when I took it out of the box. Seriously, I wouldn't be surprised if it was made of balsa wood and no thicker than a regular card board box. It is definitely tiny too -- barely any ground clearance. Even if it wasn't broken, I wouldn't have felt safe placing my toddler in it. I sent it back and didn't ask for a new one -- just a refund please."
3,"Okay bed, but worst product Ive received from Amazon",The bed is okay now that its put together. The craftmanship is mediocre. The people at DaVinci clearly let anyone put their products together. My toddler bed was missing a chunk of wood in the back and I didn't want to send it back because I had already thrown away my daughters plastic Dora toddler bed. Ultimately the situation was rectified and the bed will do for now. My daughter likes it so I guess that's all that matters.
5,Love it!,"After much indecision about which toddler bed to get, we got this for our 2-yr-old. It came undamaged and is absolutely beautiful. Took about 30min to put together. Fairly simple if you have assembled baby furniture b4. Our girl loves it! She is a flippy sleeper and with both rails it is very safe, yet she can still get in and out herself. She also stays in it all night and I think that's because if feels like her crib. We had been having trouble getting her to get into her crib at bedtime, but now she jumps right into her ""big-girl bed"". I highly recommend this bed!"
4,Adorable but won't last,"This toddler bed is adorable, but the wood is definitely not going to last. One session of my daughter jumping on this bed or just plopping down hard on it, I can see the wood pieces on the bottom frame snapping. I believe it is worth the money and will last as long as you can train your child to not ""beat it up"". The size is perfect for my 2 year old and I'm sure she will have it until she is about 4 or 5 years old. The safety rails are definitely a plus and work great!***UPDATE 09-27-2012***My daughter is now 4 years old and this bed has turned out to be a gem. As I stated in the original review, if you can teach your toddler to not jump in the bed or play rough in it, it should last a few years. We are going to try and get one more year out of it which we will then transition her to a real bed."
5,Sturdy and pretty,"We purchased the bed for my son 3 years ago and never had any problems with the bed. The maple color looks very beautiful. I really like the full-length railing, which keeps my boy from falling out. He is almost 5 years old and very soon he will outgrow it. But for now, he is still very happy with his bed."
1,"Rated ""5"" for fun by kids and adults with ""infantile"" minds.",You know... 20th Anniversary Prime comes out in 2 months.. why not save your money to buy that?Serious collectors stay the hell away from this eyesore.
4,Optimus Prime=Stupidmus Prime,"When I first saw this prime I thought it would be cool. WRONG! I mean a Prime without a mouth is sacrolige. Then I got on the computer and found out that Hasbro was starting to make Primes with mouthplates! So I bought another one and it had a mouthplate. But it looked fat and it was loose so I didn't like it anymore and without a good prime I started to not like Transformers anymore. But there was still hope, for takara was coming out with another better Prime. It looks so cool! This new Prime kicks the butts of both the Primes of Armada and Energon. Still Energon Prime is kinda cool."
1,Could the Real Optimus please stand up.,"Optimus Prime is a ... Red Semi,just like the 20th Anniverary edition figure.This guy ain't no Prime - when will Hasbro and Takara come to their senses and give us the real prime back!!"
2,Energon Prime Review,"I'm sorry. This Prime just doesn't cut it. The other Primes residing within the matrix would be ashamed. If this Prime were dropped, I'm afraid it would be ruined. On top of that, this Prime has to be the worst looking Prime in Transformers history!! Wait for the 20th Aniversary Optimus Prime toy. It will be worth the wait."
4,Prime the protector of the 4 elements,"When I first saw the new Energon Optimus Prime, I was leary of purchasing him. Due to the overall overwieght look. Then I found out morr information, 1st his 4 Vehicles that come with him represent the 4 elements Fire(fire truck), Water (submarine, not a bullet train), Earth(Drill vehicle), and finally, Air(helicopter). I also found out that this Prime can ""powerlink"" with 3 other characters thus far they are Wing Saber and Omega Supreme and Omega Sentinal. So I decided to go out and get him along with his powerlinking counterparts and am quite pleased with the new Optimus Prime. Even thought the combined Omega Supreme and Prime, Prime's head looks a little small on top of Omegas body but still looks tough"
4,Awesome bottle opener,This bottle opener is great! Once you get it to work properly (read instructions first!) it's a blast to open bottles of wine. The one con about this product is that it's been a little over 4 months (I got one for Christmas) and the C02 cartridge already needed to be replaced. I give it the benefit that with the first cartridge I was playing around a lot (and so were my friends) but it seems that it's only been a few months opening bottles here and there. Good deal I bought a 2-pack C02 cartridge refill otherwise I would've have had to open my last bottle the good ol' fashion way. And the last thing to note is that it won't open (cheap) plastic corks... just like everyone else has mentioned. Don't forget to get a couple (or at least one) extra 2-pack C02 cartridge with your order!
1,"The bottle opener was not discriptive enough, if it had been I wouldn't have bought it. I would have bought another one!","The one I ordered, just slides down around the top. When the cork comes out It doesn't extract it, I have to get a knife to pry it off. My last one didn't slide down and have a cover around it. That one broke off when I put it in the cork in the wine bottle."
3,WILL IT WORK AFTER OPENING TWO BOTTLES?,GOT THE OPENER FOR CHRISTMAS. I OPENED TWO BOTTLES AND THE GAS RAN OUT. CAN'T RETURN IT BECAUSE OF THE HAZORDOUS GAS? HAD TO ORDER MORE CARTRIDGES. I'LL KEEP MY FINGERS CROSSED.IS IT ME OR IS IT IMPOSSIBLE TO CONTACT AMAZON WITH A QUESTION?
1,Cork Pops Bottle Opener,"This order was a disaster. When the package arrived, it was obviously not what was ordered (wine bottle opener). The small box contained two CO2 refills (that I had already ordered separately-from another source). This was the case despite the invoice clearly stating that the Cork Pops Legacy Wine Bottle Opener was packed. It was a chore to find out whom to call, but this I did and after some time on the phone I was told ""they were out of them!"" I nervously waited for the refund to show up on my credit card although finally it did.My next action was to order the product straight from the company that makes it. Although I paid just a couple of dollars more, I had no trouble receiving the product I ordered. It is a great product but I would not order this through the company that Amazon was promoting! This was the first time I have had a problem through Amazon, but I will be more careful in the future."
1,No Good,"I purchased this opener and could not get a bottle of wine open with it. I used it completely like the instructions stated, making sure the needle was completely through the cork before engaging the c02. Alas, no luck. It took me more time to get the half ejected corks out of the bottles than it would have if I had just used something different to begin with. I returned it, and will stick with the rabbits."
5,Cork Pops Black Legacy Wine Opener Tops with Me!!,"This is a great value and Amazon delivered five of them to me in record time. I never fail to get a ""Wow - that's cool"" remark from someone when I pull out the Cork Pops opener. It's a must have for quick, easy opening of most bottles. Plastic corks tend not to work quite as well, but 90% of my ""opens"" work flawlessly."
3,Use a separate foil cutter . . .,"This is my third Cork Pops Legacy opener. It works well on natural cork and works most of the time on synthetics. Occasionally I have to break out the Rabbit for the synthetics. The first two we had were broken by using the foil cutter. The plastic on the Legacy isn't very strong, and my girly strength was enough to snap the plastic guide at the bottom when the cutter slid off the bottle. It's still a pretty cool wine opener, so I bought another. It lasted us a year, which is pretty good for the price I suppose, then my husband did the same thing and broke the second one. So with our third, we just decided it's best to use a separate foil cutter, then use the Legacy. They're easy to use which is why I keep buying them. I thought about getting the standard Cork Pops, but I really like the way the base twists on the Legacy model to remove the cork."
1,Do NOT Buy This Item,Total waste of my money. Did not work at all on the type of cork used in the brand of wine I use. It is a tight cork - which is a good thing - but did not budge at all with this device - which was a very bad thing.
1,has not worked,"My husband bought me one for my birthday because I love wine, we have never been able to open a bottle yet, and have tried many. I like my old fashion opener, it opens every time."
1,Do not purchase!,"I never bother to write reviews, but this time, it really got my goat... We succeeded in opening exactly ONE bottle with it. Then it was over. This thing just doesn't work! And to add insult to injury, it cannot be returned... I wish I had read the fine print! Frankly, Amazon.com shouldn't sell stuff that may not be returned (but I am puzzled: why were they able to ship it, while we are not?)"
5,Works great!,"I got this as a gift, and thought it was silly, but now I use it weekly and have bought one of all my friend for holidays. makes a great hostess gift, with a bottle of wine. I have also found it to be a conversation starter during dinners and parties. It is fast and effective with all bottles that I have tried. The only thing that gets me, is that it scares me every time I use it, think about that feeling you get right before you pop a balloon."
5,"Easy, fast, and fun to use","Built in foil cutter works every time. Don't try to force it down far, just let the point of the unit touch the foil, squeeze and turn, and off comes the foil. After foil is removed, push the point into the cork until the unit stops on top of the bottle, push the cannister while lightly lifting up the unit and the cork pops right off! It takes two or three practice tries to achieve perfection, but it's so much fun using it that you don't care."
5,Great wine opener,"I love this wine opener. Had one before bot lost it. Though it is expensive, I used it for many bottles, it is very easy to use, the wine opens with no efforts at all. Very cool gadget."
5,Automobile Magazine,If you are a car lover than you have to have this magazine subscription which is way cheeper than the newsstand cover price. I love their new format and larger size which sets it apart form competitor auto magazines.
1,Buy Something Else,"Automobile magazine is a huge letdown. Their content, which was once somewhat edgy and original, has slipped to become mundane. What is worse, however, is the fact that they have the worst customer service in the industry. I was double billed for my subscription and after 3 calls to their customer service team, was informed that hey had no idea what I was talking about and could not fix the error. Additionally, there were 2 interruptions in my subscription, neither of which appeared to have any good reason. A few calls into customer service fixed the problem but I am definitely not buying them again. Try AutoWeek instead, or if you're more conservative, Car and Driver."
2,Disappointed,"I am disappointed by Automobile...Over the course of two years they have shed about 50/60 pages of content off their magazine and it is now thinner than ever and stuffed full of ads. I was glad to not renew my SubscriptionCons:- Very Biased (ALWAYS favor the Porsche)- Little to no content- Little to now actual Car NewsPros:-Its $10 bucks-I love the photographyVerdict: GetRoad & TrackorCar and Driver, They have never let me down"
3,Well..,I have been a die hard Rodney fan since his first album. This album is funny but a little disappointing. It only has five tracks of his stand-up and some of his material was a little repeditive from his last three albums.
3,"Wow, I thought I bought a comedy album","Alright, I have read everyone else's review and one thing is gonna be the same about mine. The stand up is very, very funny, but I thought I bought a comedy album not a music CD. The songs that I heard were not funny, on his other albums at least he does funny songs. I think he is confused about whether he wants to have a singing career or a comedy career.... but I hope he makes his mind up. Just for the record I would NOT buy a Rodney Carrington music CD."
5,Rodney Carrington,"Side splitting hilarious. Contains some of his older stuff that you've probably already heard, but always worth hearing again!"
2,[Two stars out of four] Simply not as good as Future Force...,"But without the lovely Dawn Wildsmith andBob Tessier (see him also in One Man Forcewith the late John Matuszak), what could oneexpect. Father-and-future-son duo are fineup to a point, but if super-future cop JohnTucker is so smart v. the bad guys, how comehe can't figure out that's his son? Carradinedivorced Gail Jensen after this flopped. Shewas directing his film career which took adown turn Bird On A Wire, with Mel Gibson..."
4,The police had better do their job,"When I first saw this movie years ago, I thought ""This could never happen. We must always believe in our police force to protect us."" After watching the movie, maybe the future of law enforcement isn't the end of crime, but a privatization of law enforcement to the civilian sector to help control crime.This movie was great for being an eye opening experience and considering what happened on 9-11-01, maybe it's time the armed citizens in the community stand up and help the police department out. Or maybe it's time to say, we as the citizens of the United States, must come together to fight the common enemy."
5,"The ""How-to"" book for the rest of us","The subtitle of this book is ""An easy-to-use practical guide to relationship witnessing"" and that's an accurate description. It's readable, shows a lot of experience behind the authors, and takes the reader point by point through how to talk about his or her faith. Highly recommended."
1,not very good..,if a book can't grab you in an hour the rest of its most likly as bad. that's the sad case here.
3,Steps out but dosen't always stand out,"3 1/2Instrumental post-rock with a distinct yet seamless western slant, Grails' debut may have been a bit rough around the edges but showed a surprising amount of character given the songwriting limitations. Just as any pretentious repetition or derivative obviousness begins to creep in, the group manages to convey their own slight slant and procure future interest."
4,HARDCORE FROM SWEDEN,"This is a great effort by this swedish quartet ( Ollo:vocals, Mört:guitar, Anderschon:bass, J.-C.:drums ). It's fast and original plus I love that this CD is an Import because it's fun to be the only one who has it. The only down side is that it's pretty short. The 16 tracks that compose this CD add up to less than 30 minutes. Anyway, this is a short but great musical outburst and no hardcore collection would complete without it.I hope I can find more bands with this much energy but for now, MISCONDUCT remains my favorite band in this genre."
4,"Grammar Fail, but still a great book!","It doesn't take a grammar buff to stumble over all the misplaced commas and various typos, but overall, this is a very helpful book for any photographer who needs to add a little business savvy to their marketing and general business plans. Other than the grammar, it's an easy read, well organized with helpful examples of the ideas presented."
3,"Good recipes,but rather involved","If you are looking for a quick and easy to prepare recipe...not here from what I have found.If you don't mind some detailed preparation, go for it. Otherwise they are not bad."
5,Awesome book,"There seems to be a lot of talk about Tom Brokaw's latest: A Long Way from Home: Growing Up in the American Heartland. What he has done for South Dakota and the generations that came before him, Linda Scott DeRosier has done for Appalachia and her people. This is a beautiful memoir: honest, intelligent, loving, and most of all human. I definitely recommend this book."
2,A bit disappointing...,"I was really looking forward to this CD. Finally, something new from this great band. There's a few great tracks on here, some ""filler"" as well. It does give you the feel of one of their live shows...but...BUT...My main gripe is that the recording quality is really poor. I have bootlegs that sound better than this CD! Seems like it should've been sold at a reduced price considering... I was suprised to read that a couple of the shows included here were recorded to 16-track...they all sound like they're recorded on a portable Minidisc Player by someone in the auduence. Hmm... Just disappointing from people that I know are capable of such great production work.If you're not a HUGE fan, I'd unfortunately have to recommend that you just wait for their next studio release (if there's one planned)...which I'm sure will be excellent."
2,SGM at their worst,"This is a low-quality bootleg sounding cutup of live shows. There are only a few good tracks on here, the rest is just inbetween noises (which can be ok). I have many bootlegs and there are much better versions of the songs that are on here. Although I do love Moe!'s song on here and ""the neighborhood"". But there are so many live classics missing from here; including a cover of This Heat's SPQR, The Donkey-Headed Advisory of Humanity Opens the Discussion, Flinch, The Creature, Cockroach... But hopefully those will appear on their next album.Stick to the First album (which is GREAT!) and bootlegs you can get your hands on, then try this for any extras you may have missed."
4,WOO oo,as stated by most of the other reviewers the recording quality of this release is a not so good... but it still has its major share of the goodness of Sleepytime and I do think it brings the live experience kind of close... keep your eyes peeled for the DVD out this Summer!!!!! and new material I heard the last two concerts I was at should be culminating in a new album. the version of Babydoctor on this album is killer. this also reafirms ion my mind that bring back the apocalypse must be re recorded... which would be a sweet experience. All in all this is not for the begginer but if you own grand opening and closing or of natural history I recommend this for it's quirky rants and intense ROCKING!!!!!!!
5,Lanza Fade Protector,"I really love this product line with their ColorCare items available as they all seem to keep my hair color fresh longer. The fact that I can buy the ""color protector"" in such a large quantity is great too. I wish it came in a spray bottle, however. Lanza products arethose which I've used for years now. I wish they were sold in stores. But, I'm happy I can obtain them online!"
5,Webkinz Cow,"It's been a while since I received this cute toy. I ordered this for one of my grandchildren who was so into the webkinz animals for a while. Although her interests have changed, she still loves this one and all the others I bought her. This toy is very cute and colorful and soft to play with. My granddaugher still plays with it and she is 11."
3,Cute but strange hair,"My 7-year old received this and a Pegasus Webkinz at the same time. She loves the Pegasus and this one got an ""OK"" rating from her. The hair is strange, not soft and thick like the Pegasus. She still likes it but nowhere near as much."
1,Imagine taking a piss and missing the toilet,"After running out of crossman pellets i whent down to the local walmart and saw these cheap daisy variety packs of pellets. I bought 3 and thought i had just gotten an amazing deal, but i was so wrong. The next day i was plinking cans and used the daisies. After 20 missed shots on one can at 15 yards i knew something was wrong. I know that my remington vantage is a pretty damn accurate rifle and im a pretty good shot. But even after shooting mounted it took me 3 shots too make an easy one. When aiming center mass on a can, mounted, at 10 yards i barely knicked the can. Please do yourself a favor and never buy these pellets. If your looking for a pellet that is accurate, affordable, and enjoyable stick with crossman."
1,Horrible Accuracy,"The first can of pellets I bought was Crosman Destroyer. I got used to shooting those. Sighted in on a cheap Daisy air rifle from Wal-Mart, the Crosman pellets could very consistently hit a 3-inch target at about 30-yards.Then I bought these. They were a few pennies cheaper at Wal-Mart when I ran out of Crosman, and I thought maybe they'd work even better since I'd be shooting them from a Daisy gun. Ha! Out of 10-15 shots, I hit my (3-inch) target once and the others were high, low, left, right. Spread out over about a 12-inch area. No consistency whatsoever. (Keep in mind this is the same gun and distance the Crosmans hit consistently.)They're going back. Thought I'd save someone else the trouble of a return. Don't buy these."
2,Cheep stuff,If you are looking for bottom of the barrel low price pellets these are the ones. Some of them where unsuitable to be shot and had to be discarded. The rest where very loose in the barrel of my Winchester 1028 WS and therefore had horrible accuracy. If you just want shots down range buy these. If you want to hit anything don't.
2,daisy pellets,the pellets sucked every few times i shoot the pellets out of my gun the pellets would brake and mess up my gun so it would be nice if you gave me some free c02's 4.5mm bb's and pellgunoil so i can fell happy because im not happy right now
3,"Good, but not adequate","A lot of people told me that this book will cover the most of the exam. Well, they were right in some ways, but not all. I bought both Barron's and PR's, but neither of them were like the real one. This book was certainly way too easy compared with the real Chem exam. If you're looking for a high score like 700+, then I recommend buying another one along with this one, because it helped me with the concept on the first part of the exam. If you're confident with the basic concepts, then don't buy this book. It's repetitious and time-consuming for more advanced students."
1,Think about it first,"Princeton doesn't provide a good amount of information and will not improve your grade much. After using this book, I scored a 550, but after using Barron's, I scored 740. Barron's is the ultiate testbook. It may seem hard but it gives you every tiny detail necessary that may come on the actual exam. I would recommend Barron's for everyone taking the SAT II Biology or Kaplan as a second choice. I would only recommend Princeton if it was the only or last book left for the SAT II Biology."
2,Lots of mistakes,This book has a lot of typos and other mistakes. please think twice before buying it.
2,"I like Princeton Review Books, But This One Stinks","The author of the book, no matter how much he tries to fool you, is not familiar with the SAT II: Chemistry Exam. There were a lot of things on the actual test that were not covered in his book. For example, he did not cover reaction precipitates, various indicators and their respective color reactions to acidic and basic solutions, and net ionic equations. The practice tests were un-realistic also. In my opinion, you are better off with some other test preparation book. This book has really made me wary of Princeton Review's claim of expertise when it comes to ETS and its tests."
4,its good and not completly boring,"okay, i just got my score back from the may SAT 2 chem test, and i got a 710. since my goal was 700, this was good. anyways, this is basically the only book i really used, and i think it helped alot... alot of the stuff (almost half) i was learning for the first time. but the stuff is explained really well, and the writer is a little bit sarcastic so its somewhat amusing when your reading it, considering your learning chemistry.the only problem i really ahd with the book was that i did not understand titration or any of that stuff for the test, even after i read that sectionin the book. it might be just me, but i didnt think they explained that part really well.overall, i reccomend this book, but i would also get the 'real sat 2's' book by the college board. it has a real test in it, and i took it right before the real thing to work on some last minute things i was messing up on.so, i guess im saying get this book. its good.word."
1,Not at all like the real life of Sut Ungar,"This movie did not go with the life of Stu Ungar. The movie depicted him as an only child when he actually had a bother and sister. His wife was actually named Madeline and had a son Ritchie before they met. This was a horrible movie and was nothing like the real Stu, the actor didn't even look like Stuey or acted like him. Horrible movie"
5,Buy Marc Eric's cd / The music in this movie.,"If your a fan of gambling & it's history, this is a great movie. What made Stu famous also ruined him. However, a real treat is the inclusion of Marc Eric's music. An awsome singer-guitarist who contributed to the sound track. Theres a great video of one of his songs tagged on to the end of the movie. Buy the movie & find his cd as well! Both outstanding performances."
2,The Stu Ungar Story?,"Michael Imperioli (Christopher on ""The Sopranos"") stars as Stu Ungar, the troubled three time World Series Of Poker Champ. Imperioli does a good job, but the movie isn't really up to much. The movie touched on the basic facts like Ungar's WSOP wins, and his death, but in no great detail. As far as Poker movies go I found Rounders to tell a more complete story. This is a bio-pic, and as such probably has the historical accuracy (inaccuracy), of movies like Brave Heart."
1,Read the book.,"Stu Unger was a really unique individual. He was to poker, what Bobby Fisher was to chess. However, this movie lacks any depth of detail and fails to provide any insight into the mind and personality of Stu Unger. If you are interested in gaining a glimpse into what made Stu Unger tick, I would highly recommend the book, ""One Of A Kind""."
5,Movie,Was a great movie....enjoyed the story behind it and the package came quick and was happy with the movie great choice for anyone.
4,The Stu Ungar Story,"I really enjoyed it. Watched it twice. I love the star, Michael Imperioli. He made the movie. Not sure if it would have been as good without him. If you play poker, you'll enjoy this true story."
3,High roller,I had hoped the this would focus more on the amazing reads he was able to make and not as much on his personal life. With that said it is still a good movie and I will watch it again.
2,Quite disappointing,"Firstly, this is not a poker movie, if that is why you considered buying this, don't. However, there are other reasons that I didn't like the movie. It veers to far into the cheesy ""movie of the week"" treatment of someone who was quite troubled and it didn't help me understand the main character.The cast is quite good, but Imperioli is mis-cast as Stu. There's a reason that he was called ""The Kid""; when he won his second World Series title at age of 27, he looked about 14.In short, make sure you see this before you buy it."
2,Brief But The Truth,"Hi,I brought this product as I wanted to know more about how Stu Ungar rose and fell again. However the DVD itself it's very depressing as it only covers his drug abuse and his huge loses on the sports book. All in all if you want to know about Stu's life by the book one of a kind, I'm half way through and it's very detailed."
4,every high school teacher should see this!,"As there is so little responsible, empathic depictions of Arabs and especially Palestinians in the current media, this movie is a breath of fresh air. It accurately and endearingly shows the adjustment struggle of an Arab family to North America. I thought the high school scenes were poignant reminders of how high school classes need to be taught as if they were representations of the outside/""real"" world - not free for all zones where you can say anything and not be held responsible! Everyone needs to learn ""civilised"" behavior,or else we all pay the consequences. I liked that they spoke real Arabic in Amreeka - did you know that alot of Hollywood Arabic is just gobeltygook? How disrespectful! Maybe we can start actually seeing Arabs in film as people, and not the stereotype that gives us permission to project our disowned feelings onto - what a concept! This movie moves us forward!"
2,Slow Moving and Predictable,"The lead female character played her role very well, but the story itself and the drama it entailed were not strong enough to maintain one's interest at a high level for nearly 2-hours. In fact, the ""new immigrant tale"" is a universal one that has been told many times before, and I found nothing really new here. The only interesting aspect was the Middle Eastern political context--which was not presented in any real depth. Although this DVD could well have some appeal to those with an interest in Arab-American culture and language, I don't believe it will attract a wider viewing public."
4,Good Movie,Good movie...shows how tough it is to emigrate to another country/culture...there are prejudices on both sides of the ocean...Well done.
2,Historical cases help solve cases.,Narration is very good. It's good to know that some small details can help solve cases. That's why it is important to scour thoroughly in order to find things that will be solid eivdences later on.
5,A Unique Selection - Classical/Farsi/Traditional & Modern Qs,"Being an ardent listener of NFAK Qawwalis, I will strongly recommend this ""unique selction"" . It contains: - 1: Classical Qawwali, slow but heavy in verses - 2: Farsi Qawwali - A beautiful selection from Hazrat Amir Khusrau's Kalaam Very Upbeat and stimulating - 3: Traditional - Hazrat Amir Khusrau's Kalaam. Though slow one. - 4: Modern Qawwali - Iqbal's Poetry (Shikwa /Jawab Shikwa) - Having read the poetry of Iqbal, I thoroughly enjoyed the recitation of ""Shikwah/Jawab"" by NFAK. Wonderful Piece!"
4,Watcher in the Attic,"Though this film, Watcher in the Attic, has received a lot of critical lambaste, I was really surprised by how well made it was. First of all, I love Rampo Edogawa novels. I thought his novel ""Japanese Tales of Mystery and Imagination"" was amazing, plus this is one of the few films where even though his character is the villain of sorts, his character is still sympathetic. In 1923 Tokyo the landlord of a boarding house spys on those dwelling below beneath his roof.Though almost all of the characters excluding Minako Sayanomiya/Saburo Gouda and the landlord are two dimensional, it doesn't really hamper the film since it works best as a glimpse into the landlord's tortured and torturous life.If you're a Rampo Edogawa fan, then you immediately need to get this."
5,Riviting...,"A gripping, personal account of growing up in Rwanda and the Rwandan genocide. Ms. Mushikiwabo's memories are at turns heartbreaking and charming, her country's history intriguing, and the statistics unfathomable (""State executioners and local volunteers...catching and dispatching more than three times as many people as al Qaeda did when it dropped the World Trade Center. That's not how many they killed altogether. That's how many they killed every day - ten thousand a day...for one hundred days.""). Childhood stories bring Ms. Mushikiwabo and her family to life, making them your family, your friends. This is an engrossing read that starkly reminds us simultaneously of the cruelty of human nature and the spirit to survive unimaginable sorrow."
2,Research in Numbers,"This is the driest Csikszentmihalyi I have read. Too many numbers and the information seems drawn out much longer than necessary. Does not seem the authors were able to really ""tap into"" the adolescent mind. While much information is still relevant, this book lacks a lifelike quality that would have been more appealing. DISCLAIMER: Have only read to chapter 8, perhaps it gets more interesting and personal in the final chapters."
3,O Henry endings,"I purchased this book for Henri Duvernois' short story ""Clothes Make the Man"". This was a short story I read more than 30 years ago. I think about this story almost everyday, due to the steady decline of sartorial refinement in our society. When I see how the ""casual-dress workplace"" has declined from khaki pants and dress shirts to faded jeans, tee-shirts and tennis shoes, when I see women wearing Crocs to work, when I see the youth of America wearing baggy clothes, tee-shirts, and ballcaps on backwards, when I see our new president without his suit coat in the Oval Office, when I see a proliferation of sweat pants in our shopping malls and restaurants, I think of this story.O. Henry's ""The Last Leaf"" is another short story I read many years ago that is worth the price of purchase. This book is easy to read, and has simple exercises at the end of each story. A great book to have in your library especially for your children or grandchildren."
4,A Time capsule,"Bill Conti's 80s disco infused soundtrack to one of Sir Roger Moore's more serious outings as 007 is a time capsule for sure. I can't help but smile at the disco vibe during some of the chase scenes. One of my favorite Bond movies shot in beautiful Mediterranean locations. I would have given the soundtrack a 5 rating if it had been timeless but as it is it definitely transports you back to the early eighties, which is not necessarily a bad thing!"
3,"Not bad, but not great either!","I rented this because two things seemed to go together; rated R, and Nicole Eggert was in it. Need I say more? :-)However, this is no ""Blown Away"". The closest you see ""the Egg"" naked is when she strips down to briefly enter the shower to help the alien (who at that moment had control of a beautiful woman's body) wash herself, but you never see anything of her.I don't remember much else except the alien eating everyone and Amanda falling in love with the alien itself, rather then the body it takes over. However it is funny and is worth it for ""Egg"" fans."
4,Amanda and the Alien,"Stumbled onto this movie. How camp..... how funny! If you have a ""sick"" sense of humor, like I do, (Sherman's Lagoon being my favorite comic strip) then it is definitely worth watching."
4,Water toy with kids are always popular,"No, this does not need batteries. I don't even recall what the wave maker thing is, the shower works by pouring water into the palm tree I believe. The waves are probably some manual thing you have to do. I bought it for a 4 year old and she enjoys it. It is one of those darn toys that you put together and then have to fight to get it apart to fit back in the box. Just the other day my daughter wanted the pool out that comes with it She was satisfied with just putting the blow up pool in the back yard and putting her Polly Pockets in it. Great for the summer when kids will play outside and you don't care what gets wet. I don't regret the purchase and my child enjoys it."
2,Pool set ok but don't get it for Kayla...,"She DOES NOT come w/ the set!!! These kind folks were nice enough to replace the first set to only send another that was still missing Kayla. Pool set is kind of cool but don't bother if you're only interested in the ""Exclusive Kayla."" So far, even the manufacturer's Customer Relations Dept. doesn't know if she exists!"
1,Very narrow sandal,"I usually wear regular wide, this sandals were extremely narrow, my toes were sticking out. I had to return the item."
5,Now you can get Deli Style Rye Triscuits in Utah!,"I love the Deli Style Rye Trisuits, but you can't get them in Utah (What? Don't the mormons alow that either?). I love that I can get them on Amazon. For any of you Utahns who want to try a really good, healthy cracker, try them! Also, my favorite Campbell's soup (Fiesta Chili) you can't get in Utah, but you can get on Amazon."
3,Harry Owens & Royal Hawaiians,"This is actually two taped TV programs. Unfortunately the quality is very poor and there is nothing to give you any indication of the date they were taped. Also none of the entertainers are listed nor are the names of the songs they preform. Unless you recognize them only Hilo Hattie and the two ""guests"" are given credits.That all being said I enjoyed this immensely. If you are a fan of that era, Hawaiian or Hapa Houli music you will too."
5,my review,In this story a small pig gets a majic banket and likes it alot. The animals and people on this blanket come alive at nigt . They play with him and he loved it. Then once his aunt washed it by the river. It began to rain and piggy ran into the night . He brought it back and put it by the fire and played with his friends.I loved this book(not realy)but yea !
4,My favorite book as a little kid!,this was my favorite book as a little kid and I am so sorry to see it out of print!!
3,Works great until....,"I bought one of these after two other types stopped working. Plugged this one in and LOVED the way it turns on then dims the light by just being tapped! It had been working great for a few months BUT last night the bulb in the lamp blew out, and just like the other dimmers, this one stopped working.So now I'm going to buy some of those lifetime bulbs and another one of the Skylink dimmers, and hopefully the problem is solved.Just beware, the dimmer will work only as long as the lightbulb does! When the bulb goes, so goes the dimmer."
3,Didn't Last Long,I bought this for my 85 year old Mother because she had a hard time turning the light switch. It worked great for about 4 months. Then the light bulb blew out and the Touch Dimmer never worked again. Very disappointed!
5,Easiest to reach over then to reach up,This was a replacement for the same model I purchased by mail order back in the late 80s. Before there was the world wide web. Was glad to find it's still available after all these years.
1,-_- bad. Very bad.,"OK. He looks really cool, no Doubt! But he has a dark side. Very dark. If you wanna change him, you gotta take him apart, add more pieces, rip him up, add more, so on. And if you dont pay attention *coughlikemybrother* you will forget the peices, and throw them away with the trash. Personally, I think this toy should be in the trash. I think it is. :\"
3,"unicron,not bad,but.........","I purchased unicron for my 8 yr old son for christmas,it's a great looking piece,but a few flaws.first,trying to transform from robot to planet,not an easy task,alot of twisting,some of the other pieces fall off and dont match up together.the directions are ok,but could have been better."
1,not worth 50 dollars not worth 20,i got 1 of the giant things a few years ago it dosnt hold together and u have to take iit apart to transform it almost nothing works right =/ u shouldnt get it a collect transformers i have atlest 50 all r good but this 1 it crap so dont buy it i warn u!!!!!!!!!!!!1
1,Worst transformer EVER,THIS IS NOT FUN AT ALL. ITs hard to transfom and it is boring after a while. DO NOT get THIS TRANSFORMER! HE BREAKS TOO EASILY!
2,Big Disappointment,"Unicron was at the top of my 7 year old's list for Christmas. He got it - and was extremely disappointed. I was ready to throw it out the window just trying to get it out of the box!!!! The packaging is absolutely ridiculous - there was too many twist ties and too much tape! It took 1/2 hour just to get the thing free. Also, my son swears that in the TV commercial (I didn't see it) that Unicron talks - the toy does not. Try explaining advertising tactics to an upset child on Christmas morning. He hasn't touched the thing since."
4,Unicron is Awsome.,"Unicron was great, but when I got him I noticed it was harder to transform than I thought. With a little practice, now I am a pro at it. Make sure you check the directions when transforming the hands. I once got them stuck. Be careful loading the chest missle, because it always pops out the first few times you push it in. Overall it is really fun. I would have liked a lower price, but at least they lowered it $10.00. So you if your a transformer fan like me, I believe you will have fun with it.Steven (age 9 1/2)"
5,Awesome Repaint!,"I know a lot of Transformers fans hate repaints, but I'm not one of them. I like a lot of the repaints, and, in my opinion, THIS ONE ROCKS! Great repaint of an already cool toy! I haven't transformed Energon Unicron yet (it's tricky; I could do it, but it's not worth the trouble when he's so much more fun in robot mode!), but his robot mode kicks butt! While I certainly enjoyed the Armada Unicron (especially since his paint job matched the Movie version), I like this one better. The cool neon green, orange, & black make him more menacing a make for a much cooler looking toy. He has MAJOR articulation (wish he could bring his hand to his mouth, though, so I could pretend he's devouring TFs like in the Movie or issue #75 of the Marvel comic book, though.). One of the best TFs ever, and, either in its Armada or Energon version, worth getting! BTW, the Energon version may be hard to find, because A LOT of Energon Unicron boxes have the Armada Unicron packed inside instead."
1,wouldn't register,"I got two of these as replacements. Kind of wish I'd just spent the money on a new set. One of them never registered, and is just a paperweight now. There is no info on what to do if your handset won't register, and tech support is a joke. Unfortunately, portable 2 line systems are hard to come by. I'm probably going back to the panasonic."
2,Printer with a life of one year?,"WHen I bought this printer in July 99, I thought it was a really good deal.... However over the last year and 3 months I have bought atleast four cartridges and one refill set...and I have printed maybe 5000 sheets of black and white pages. Never used it for color printing but now the printer is dead- in other words there are too many white lines etc making it almost impossible to use it for final printing.Tried all the tricks in the manual. Staples was kind enough even to replace the cartridge but didnt help. So i have to get rid of it. You decide whether you think this is value for your money!"
1,Sample this album before buying!!!!!!,I made the huge mistake of buying this albumn before actually listening to him at all. I bought this albumn stricky off of reviews and interviews i read. I wasted 15 bucks on something i will never listen to fully and i am a huge underground hip hop fan... but this is almost not even hip hop.... he sounds like a mix between Whitey ford and Kid Rock meets instrumental hip hop ...on crack. if you are looking for a lyricist look somewhere else...there is more singing on this albumn then anything...This is just an opinion but it speaks the truth!
3,i was expecting more,"this just isn't what i thought it would be. Don;t like the singing. LB doesn't go out there, the way i expected him too. It's better than lots a stuff you hear but i think he can do better."
5,Must Have Album,"I was lucky enough to have been jamming to this album before it hit the streets. As soon as it hit the stores I was there grabbing my copy. This album is definitely a must have for true hip-hop fans, its not tainted by today's MTV-esque albums that are mainstream. The beats are great and Lyrics Born definietly has some talent when it comes to rhyming, he can flow like no other. I played this album to friends and they agree its hands down a great album. one person asked ""is that tone-loc?"" this japanese rapper needs to be heard, so what are you waiting for, get your copy asap."
2,Not the best,"As a work of literature, this book doesn't quite make it. Sentence structure is poor, and it is riddled with grammatical problems and sloppy typos. However, this could be a very useful book for a cyclist planning a long-distance trip. Some of the author's observations are very interesting (although his way of describing them is often annoying) and he details some of the hardships and adventures involved in such a journey. His description of a temporary riding mate and their undesired reunion later was amusing.Still, this book could have used a good proofreader, as the author (though he claims to be a journalist) has very little understanding of apostrophe and comma use, and his attempts to be amusing with wordplay end up looking clumsy. His writing style is often confusing and I found myself rereading passages several times to figure out what he was talking about. If you love biking and don't care about grammar, sentence structure or interesting writing, then this is a book for you."
2,"Great Trip, Bad Writing","As a work of literature, this book doesn't quite make it. Sentence structure is poor, and it is riddled with grammatical problems and sloppy typos.

2,Great Ride.. Hard to Read,"This book feels like an accumulation of unedited e-mail. If punctuation and grammar are important to you, this book might get on your nerves."
1,Don't buy this book!,Surely reading this book is harder than the bicycle tour it describes. The author musters his limited understanding of the English language to present a work of little more than vacuous dribble. Thankfully it is very brief.
5,Undeniably cheerful music...,"Listen to Northern Light when the mind and spirit are in need of an infusion of optimism and cheer. You will find a wonderful mix of traditional Celtic and Scandinavian selections, played on the Celtic harp and the unique-sounding kantele. Tasteful flute further enlivens this recording. Put it on for a delightful music experience."
1,Pompous self promoting nonsense in Alaska!,"First off I want to say that the professional quality of the filmography and production is excellent.There is a little bit of hunting, and they are good quality film sequences.Beyond that Larry Bartlett spends the rest of the video telling you how awesome he is, and selling his rafts and DVDS.Pass on this one."
1,Actually...,"These guys are very bad. I saw them live with Dio and Anthrax (two actually good bands) and they sucked bad. Every one of their songs were the same... bad. Not only was not a single person in the crowd there for this band, they practically got boo-ed off the stage. The only time anyone cheered was when they mentioned Dio and left the stage.Everyone else who wrote a review for this cd must be a member of the band because nobody who listens to metal could enjoy this. There are hundreds of better bands than this so think twice if you are considering buying this."
5,Great band ignore the deaf dude down there,"How anyone could say this band was booed is sad. They are a blend of Sabbath, Fu Manchu and a dash of Kyuss. Yeah, it's been done before but it still sounds good. I'm just shocked by the review down there. Maybe it was a Fireball Ministry cover band? They are really great live, seen them twice. As for them opening for Dio, who is always great and Anthrax, eh not as great anymore, hey maybe that was it. Maybe Anthrax was playing and you got them confused?"
4,Excellent love story,"I loved Medeiros' Nobody's Darling, Thief of Hearts and A Kiss to Remember. This one ranked right up there for me. It was a real page turner...finished it in one day. I felt the chemistry between the two main characters from the very beginning. The heroine was very funny and likeable. I also loved the hero, he was beyond sexy. I can't wait for Julian's story."
4,Fresh and funny for Medeiros,"Just when you think you have Teresa Medeiros pegged for Medieval or Regency or Time Travel or Fairy Tale (all prior storylines for this multi-talented writer), she comes through with a fresh version of the vampire romance! The characters were witty and the love story solid. I can't get on board with the idea that this is her best ever since I've loved different books for different reasons. Let's just say this is her best vampire romance yet - until Julian and Portia's story!"
4,"quick, easy, good read","This is the first book of at least a two book series (see ending). It features three sisters, two brothers and associates from the brother's school days. A few historical errors aside, it is an entertaining story. Without giving too much away, things may not be what they seem when the eldest and youngest Cabot sisters join their enchanting and socially perfect middle sister in London to meet her suitor. The language is cleaver and there are a couple of cute twists and turns. Overall, the book is a good, quick read."
3,3.5 Vampire Story,"Im not a fan of vampire stories. After reading several other books by this author, I did not expect this one to fit that category. The whole vampire idea is just so far fetched it overshadowed any believability of a story.This book was just OK."
3,Just OK,"I didn't see much romance in this book at all. For the first 2/3 of the book, Kane hates Caroline. Then you turn a page, and BAM! he loves her. There was very little contact between the two, so just when did they fall in love?The entire book seemed like it was setting up a sequel - Julien and Portia's story. And I'll probably read that one, too."
2,So frustrating,"I really like the style that Medeiros has shown in the past, but this plot left me cold. I was waiting for an interesting twist as to why the hero was nocturnal. Instead I get the ridiculous scenario I got (no plot revelation despite those of others). I would have liked some warning that this was science fiction. I like historical fiction that makes me feel like I've experienced a different era, not implausible nonsense."
3,Not her best,"I was blown away by ""Yours until Dawn."" Wow, that was one I could read again and again. I was expecting more of the same with ""After Midnight."" I love how Medeiros has dealt with the supernatural in the past -- especially her stories about witches/computers. This story, however, was a big let down. I actually had trouble finishing it. There are so many other good vampire tales out there. I felt this story was rushed. The details we needed we didn't get and the ones we were given -- yawn. Perhaps her editor rushed her for a deadline.I will probably buy her books in the future and maybe even the sequeal to this one, but I expected better from such a talented author."
5,Romance and Vampires,"I have always been a fan of Teresa's books and I was a little hesitant about this one based upon the reviews I saw here.I purchased this book at a local used bookstore and read it in less than 24 hours. The story had me from the get go, I found it very entertaining and a worth while read. Much better writing than the average author, and a nice twist to the ""poor heroine and the rich aristocrat"" that is repeated over and over in this genre. I look forward to Portia and Julian's sequel coming out this year. I can't wait to see what happens to them. Thanks Teresa for another great book!"
5,outstanding book for xeriscaping,The authors start out with the background information regarding the environment and basicgardening techniques. Then the book provides in-depth information on the suitable plants along with photographs. These detailed descriptionsare very useful and clear. I highly recommendto anyone who is thinking or just want to know about xeriscaping.
2,Plants for Warm and Dry Climates,"Although this book supposedly covers my region of New Mexico, I found so little in it that applied to me that I am returning it. Three-fourths of the book is a plant reference, and most of the plants are not cold hardy below 20 degrees Fahrenheit, making about half the book wasted paper as far as I am concerned. Also, a lot of xeric standards for this region are missing.If you can, check the map on pages 2-3 to make sure that you live in the Low or Middle regions (as I write this, the map is included in the scanned pages here on Amazon, but isn't displaying properly). For the High region, I recommend instead any of the books by Judith Phillips, who writes toward climates that are slightly wetter and somewhat cooler than the ones that are the focus here."
3,Surprised & disappointed,My first purchase from Amazon worked out really well but this last one did not. The condition of the book was overstated. The content of the book is great.
3,"Very cute, but disappointing","I bought this expecting a much sturdier structure! The little pieces that come with the set are cute, especially the table and chairs. My daughters have enjoyed everything except the actual playground, because it's so hard to use. Even on a prefectly flat table the whole thing wobbles, and the slide doesn't always stay on. The Kelly playground released a few years ago was a much better set, it never tipped as easily. I do like this set, but I think the pool is a better buy, it's much better made, and the grocery store, which isn't pictured on this site yet, is better still. (If you haven't seen the grocery store yet, it's adorable, and comes loaded with cute little ""food"" items to shop for)."
5,Birthday Set,"When I first saw this playset I knew I had to add this one to my 9 yr. olds collection. I have been buying her Barbies and Barbie Playsets since she was able to play with Barbies. We both have fun using the sand box and the jungle gym set. Litte Nikki invites all of her friends over also to play. I have purchased all of the Happy Family playsets for my daughter. After the children have played on the swings and in the sandbox, they go for a quick splash in Happy Family pool. Keep up the good work. We look forward to more playsets in the future."
3,Not too great,"This set is cute, but since there is so many little parts the set can be lost. The set can be broken very easily. I wouldn't give this to any kids under five, because any kid could choke. Also this set doesn't come with any dolls so it's sort of a ripoff. I wouldn't really recommend this product, but if you have the whole collection it might be worth it."
1,Really? 7 discs!?!,"Ok, so I firmly believe that the 5-star reviews are people trying to convince themselves that they didn't just overpay by 85+%. I mean the repetitiveness of this set is absurd to the point of comedy. Through the first 2 CDs I was sorta just going along with it, then through 3 and 4 I was getting annoyed and irritated...though once 5 and 6 went in I just had to laugh. This honestly could have been accomplished with one disc- truly! Besides all that, the quality is horrendous...sounding as though there was really no remastering whatsoever. It sounds like straight vinyl->cd transfer...really unprofessional. My advice? Find a nice single CD compilation and press ""Repeat 6"". Hope this helps and saves some money."
5,Blast from the past,"Product arrived 30 years late! How did I miss this great music for so long? Not the shippers fault - the CDs arrived within a few days of ordering. I agree with the person who said that if you like ""Singles going steady"" you'll probably want this one too."
5,I almost forgot...,"...what a great album this is. This is definitive pop punk, sweaty and hard rocking. I call it happy punk, which is a relative term. Though full of angst and confusion of the times The Buzzcocks were not one of those F*-this and F*-that nihilistic type of punk bands. You pogo dance to it, you don't slam dance.This could possible be one of the 10 best albums of all time."
1,do NOT buy for large breed dogs!,"i bought this toy in hopes that it would actually last. i have a 1 yr old rottweiler puppy and within 5 minutes, he chewed the corners off and ripped through both layers!! i thought i was supposed to be durable and tough. i would NOT recommend this toy for large breed dogs! i am upset that i spent $12 for a toy that lasted 5 minutes!"
2,Shredded in 60 Seconds,"My pit-mix shredded this toy very quickly. I know it is not a ""chew toy,"" but, I left the toy with the dog for 10 minutes and she had shredded it to bits. Not much else to say about it, as we really did not have a chance to play with it after that. I am sure it is a good toy if your dog is not an avid chewer, but it did not live up to it's ""tough"" description."
2,Not Tough Enough For My Yellow Lab,"Like most labs, my five-year-old male loves to chew his toys. The Fire Hose Squeak 'n Fetch sounded like the ideal tough toy for my Riley Boy. Riley was delighted with his new toy, chewing and squeaking, chewing and squeaking. However, after the first day of occasional play, he had chewed through the stitching on one end. On the second day, he had opened the end, removed a squeaker and pulled out the cotton-like filler. He still chews on it and throws it around but it's in ragged shape. If your dog is a strong, relentless chewer, I would look for another product."
1,Worthless garbage.,"Opened up this toy yesterday for my heavy chewing dog and within 5 minutes he dismantled it. Such an amazing waste of materials, money and time. Poor dog is upset that we had to take it away.DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS TOY! Look elsewhere for items with a better review.I recommend most of the KONG toys for they are durable.Can I give this item a negative star rating? It is that bad."
2,Did not pass the poodle test,"Lasted about 20 minutes, another waste of money. does anyone know of a squeak toy out there that mu poodle will not annihilate."
2,"My 25 lb terrier destroyed this ""Hard Core"" toy in 3 hours.","I expected this ""strong"" dog toy to last for a while.... not just a few hours! I was very surprised at how quickly she tore through the seams and into the fluff inside. There are two squeak bulbs that she tried to dig out almost immediately. I'm literally looking at the toy now, 3.5 hours after I first gave it to her, and all the fluff is gone, the two squeak bulbs are in the garbage and she's torn the ""tough"" fire hose material to shreds. Don't waste your money on this ""hard core"" toy."
3,My two dogs love it!,We buy toys to keep the dogs from tearing up other things. They can go through a new toy in under three minutes. This one has lasted them for months. Granted they did make a hole in it in a few hours but they did not totaly tear it appart and still play with it today. So bottom line is yes it can be torn apart but isn't that what we give the toy to the dog for? Go ahead and let the dogs play!
1,1 hr.,Well it looks strong and feels strong but it lasted about 1/2 hr. When I opened it I couldn't even hear the squeaker. I wouldn't call it a squeak toy. I kept pushing and I finally heard it barely squeak. It didn't matter because within that 1/2 hair Zeus had the corner ripped open and the squeaker out. We pulled out the stuffing so now he is ripping up the material.Oh well I stick to the Kong's he's had them over a year no sign of wear. He loves them all.
1,Not for extreme chewers,"Was given to my 40 pound staffy for Xmas. The petstore owner assured the giver it was indestructible. In under 5 minutes he had the corner off, in under 10 the nylon started to shred and some stuffing out. Was in the trash by Xmas dinner. Seemed well put together and probably fine for moderate chewers."
3,Not durable,My dogs destroyed this in 2 weeks. Within the first night they already ripped one end. If you have chewers then don't expect this to last.
1,"Durable, eh?","My runty little pitbull utterly destroyed this ""durable"" toy in T-minus 5 minutes. I'm thoroughly enjoying cleaning up the stuffing. While I know it's not a chew toy, I would expect that it could take some abuse, as, well, dogs have sharp teeth and chew on things whilst playing fetch."
2,Torn apart in about 30 minutes,"I thought this might actually withstand my dogs' chewing, but it didn't. They had the end ripped apart in less than 30 minutes, and the material this is made from leaves behind a stringy mess. I was worried about my dogs' digesting some of the red material. It looked like a good toy, but it didn't stand a chance. I'm still searching for the mythical ""indestructible"" dog toy. This certainly isn't it."
5,This is a retrieval training aid. Not a chew toy!,"For all of to the idiot dog owners...this is not a chew toy.It is for fetch and retrieval training. My lab has had his for five years, it still works and looks like new. He only gets to use it when we go to the ocean (since we live in south Florida we go often). He knows that it is his ocean toy. Again, it is not a chew. It is designed to float and be retrieved."
1,Not worth even $1,My lab mix played with this toy for about 15 minutes before she started ripping out the stuffing. This product is horrible. A rawhide chew lasts longer than this thing.
1,Didn't even last 5 minutes,"I bought 2 of these for my parents beagle/lab mixes and the literally had them shredded in under 5 minutes! I was really excited to get these and had hoped for at least a few days of use. In addition when they fall apart there are multiple TINY sqeakers inside so be careful, they're just the right size for choking."
2,7 month old Golden Retriever.,"I bought one of these at the local pet store because the reviews on here we so mixed. It either had 1 star or 5 stars. Also my brothers pit bull has had one for 2 years w/o destroying it.With those in mind, I gave it a chance. My puppy (7 month old Golden) had the entirety of the stuffing out, and a hole my fist could fit inside, in slightly under 2 hours.However I did not get to test the floating aspect of the toy, so I may take it back to Petco (they have 30 day return on everything they sell) and exchange it for one that just becomes a lake toy, where Duke wont have a dedicated chewing session on it. Might be perfect for that.Also, I seem to think as dogs get older their need to destroy may diminish. So that could be why the such polarized reviews. Perhaps in another couple of years my dog will get to enjoy this toy for months instead of minutes."
4,"good, tough product","This toy works well for my pitbulls. They were able to rip it up somewhat, but they love playing with it."
1,torn apart in 30 minutes or less,"I have a small Spitz who tore this to shreds. Before I had made my morning coffee she was tearing out the filling and chewing the gray rubber. The ""Heavy Duty"" claim Item #5004 was shreded from one end of my bedroom to the other. The big squeaker was still in one piece when I grabbed it just in time.How do I choose a toy when your product claims are false..the first toys we bought her (year old dog) was some silly squeek furry thing. although she tore it open and removed the inner foam she still carries it proudly.For this I can only say ""Bad Dog -- Toy""."
1,Don't believe it's tough - it's not!,"I believed the hype that these things were oh so very tough. My mini-schnauzer puppy ripped right through its ""double stitching"" and through the fire hose. What a waste!"
2,Not so durable :/,I bought this hoping it could stand up to my dog. No such luck! It did take him a while to shred it but by a while I mean and hour or so. The material is heavy and appears to be durable. If your dog doesn't typically doesn't destroy his chew toys then you'll be fine. If many toys don't stand up to your dog then I wouldn't recommend this one. I really thought it would be strong enough but within 30 minutes it was half gone and the squeaker was out. :/
2,GSD still loves it!,Not as durable as one I purchased a few years back. That one lasted as full year before my GSD was able to make his first hole on the toy. This one maybe lasted 15 minutes before the first hole appeared. Within 2 days the ends were bit off 1/2 way and I had to cut off the ends and remove all the stuffing and squeakers. But my GSD still loves this toy and plays with it everyday.
1,Waste of Money,I bought this toy today (04/14/12) and my three and a half month old puppy had it destroyed in under five (5) minutes. Save your money. If I could give it a zero I would!!
1,pathetic,"there is NOTHING hard core about this toy. my 7 month old lab puppy chewed a hole THROUGH the ""fire hose"" and the tough stitch in less than 2 min?! I cut the tags off gave it to him turned around and he had already ripped like 2 holes in it. this ""tough"" toy is for maybe a weenie dog maybe but nothing bigger than 20 lb."
2,"First one ok, the second was awful.","We have purchased two of these toys, with very mixed experiences. The first one lasted about a week and a half, which for our dog is years for a toy that holds her interest. She much enjoyed the squeakers, and this was a good toy to play fetch with (we live in an apartment building with hardwood floors...) As depicted in the customer images however, we had the exact same problem - she get ahold of the corner and the toy quickly unraveled!The second one that we bought faired rather less well, only lasting about three hours before completely falling apart.I don't know whether this is a quality control issue, or whether simply by design the toy is flawed, but our second experience was enough to put us off this particular toy for life.If you value your money, look elsewhere!"
1,Destroyed by a 3 month old puppy!,"This toy did not last long at all! My 3 month old lab puppy tore it at the seams! I was happy when I found a non-rubber ""tough"" dog toy for my puppy and was so disappointed when, on her first day with it, she started to shred the corner. Don't waste your money. I wish I'd read these reviews before spotting this toy at my local pet store."
2,Not strong or durable,I have an 8 month old shepherd/retreiver mix who is a heavy chewer. He tore this toy open in less than 5 minutes. The hose is not genuine fire hose and tears under the slightest pressure. Also there is no return/replacement policy. This toy is NOT worth the cost.
3,Didn't last long,"I thought I had found something that would last for my dog. Less than 48 hours after giving it to him, he managed to make 2 holes in the toy. That is not as fast as he does for most toys. (I have a 35 lbs. Border Collie, Terrier Mix that normally can destroy a stuffed animal or toy with squeakers in less than 5 minutes.)The toy feels tough. It is stuffed with the white stuffing and has 2 squeakers in it. It is a piece of firehose with canvas on the ends and they are double stitched."
1,Toy: 0 Shiba: 1,I have a 20-pound Shiba Inu. It took her 28 minutes to tear through this while we were playing. Not recommended.
1,Not at all durable,"I purchased this toy over the weekend because my 5 month old puppy very hard on her toys. I decided to purchase the Kyjen Fire Hose Squeak 'n Fetch Dog Toy b/c of its ""heavy duty"" and ""doubled stitched"" construction. My puppy zeroed in on the black end pieces and had completely sheared the entire side off, pulled out the stuffing, and had the squeaker out in 10 mins. Needless to say the toy went in the garbage less than 15 mins after bring it inside my front door.I will not be purchasing another Kyjen product anytime soon."
1,Last 5 minutes with a 12 pound dog,"We have a Bischon who weighs 12 pounds, he ripped this thing to shreds in under 5 minutes! I would not buy this again."
3,"GREAT COMPANY, NOT SO GREAT TOY","My 50 lb. mutt ripped this open in about five minutes and began pulling out the stuffing. The stuffing and squeaker inside are definitely a choking hazard. So disappointed in this ""super durable"" dog toy. It's not durable at all and was a total waste of money. Since first writing this review I contacted the company and they were more than happy to send out a different toy to replace this one. They were very polite and helpful."
4,Last 2 months with 2 boxers,"This thing is pretty durable, at least for my dogs. It is going to depend on the dog. For my two boxers, it lasts about two months. They love it."
2,VERY disappointed!,This toy is NOT as sturdy as it seems. My dog had it destroyed in less than two days. Definitely not worth the money!
3,Not Mastiff-proof...,"While this toy did last more than a day, it didn't last more than a week.The ends can be ripped off, the squeaker and stuffing removed and covering shreded...It isn't a long term toy for an English Mastiff."
2,It's alright,"I was very excited about this toy for our dog. I got the impression that it was very durable, especially being made from a fire hose. Our dog is a strong chewer and had it apart within an hour. While it lasted though, he seemed to really enjoy the smell and texture, as well as the squeek. It didn't last very long at all and it was quite messy when he had it all pulled apart."
2,Firehose Squeak & Fetch,It is not as durable as I had hoped. My Great Dane had the ends torn up and firehose material punctured within 5 minutes.
4,Great for serious chewer,My foster Corgi is a serious toy de-stuffer and he loves this toy! He has had it for several weeks and has managed to chew a small hole but not yet destroy it. The FireHose is his very favorite stuffed toy (right now - subject to change) and the first he hasn't destroyed right away. Excellent choice for the serious but not manic chewer.
4,Fairly sturdy,"I have 2 large mixed-breed dogs who destroy pretty much any squeaky toy I bring home in a matter of minutes. A friend of mine gave me one of these to field test, since he was thinking about selling them. I was amazed that it took 3 days of hard chewing for my dogs to remove the first squeaker.Once they got the first sqeaker out, I removed the stuffing and just let them play with the shell. They chewed on it regularly and played tug-of-war with it, and yet the shell lasted for several weeks. I'm on my 2nd of these toys, and I must say they are much sturdier than most dog toys I've purchased."
1,Doesnt squeak,And my dog already started to tear it at the seems. This toy wont last too much longer. It has only lasted 3 days as it is...DISAPPOINTEDI have a beagle/terrier mix who is 4 years old.....so its not a big dog!
1,Destroyed in 6,"Yes, it took about 6 minutes for my dog to chew thru the suposed non destroyable hose. Waste of money."
1,Fire Hose Dog Toy,"Material may be tuff, the stitching is not. Complete waste of money for our lab/pit bull mix. Took him about 15 minutes to destroy."
2,Bad Luck,Unfortunately one of the pieces was broken when we opened it. An arm of the largest piece was broken off.
2,Too much treble,"These headphones put out too much treble in relation to the bass. The sound is not balanced. To make it worse, the treble that it does put out gives the sound a rough quality. They may be compact and convenient, but they're not for someone with a good ear."
4,Great sound but not a snug fit,"I bought this headphone set because of the reviews that said it was great for the gym. The sound is very good and they fold easily to fit in my pocket or bag. However, if you are working out and bend over - you're going to be picking this 'puppy' up off of the floor! The headphones are very comfortable, but not nearly snug enough to stay securely on your head. (And I don't have a real small head) This is the only reason that I rated it at 4 stars - certainly not because of the sound quality. I can use them around the house or for walking, but I had to buy another set for the gym."
4,A walk on the dark side,"I had the fortune to work with Steve Taykor years ago so I was somewhat prepared for this, I have read this small book 4 years ago but felt compelled to write a review now that I have an opprtunity.Steve has an expressive structured and touching way couples with right on target language as he is telling his stories, there are 7 short storied here and I will not delve into the details, they range from dark pessimism to euphoric optimism and are all engrossing. my personal favorite was the first one ""The Haunted Piano""."
5,Perfect for an alarm cd!,"I absolutely love waking up to it - almost every single day (before switching off to NPR later on of course ;p )It starts with soft echoes of an almost ethereal flute and builds into a joyous colorful crescendo - but its not too much for early mornings. (methinks because Bhopali is a mid-night raga?) I play this randomly and it takes me to serene, calm and beautiful places. This makes a great valuable gift for friends of every color! The only confusion I have is that my CD - I brought it from India is in a single volume, I don't know why they have split it up."
4,A great step-by-step,Although I'm only learning this style I found it a great introduction for beginners. The notation is easy to read and the CD with the package was extremely helpful.
3,Nice,"Nice to learn from a point you understand the basics, but worst to start learning from it. It's better to get another book to review the basics and then begin studying this one. If not, no body will get to speak portuguese."
4,An Inexpensive Way To Learn Portuguese,"Published by price-conscious folks at Dover Publications, ""Essential Portuguese Grammar"" is a great, compact book to learn and/or brush up on your Portuguese grammar. Considered by many linguists as one of the most difficult languages to learn due to its' many nasal verbs and differences among Brazilian and Lusitanian norms, Portuguese will require many hours of countless study before anyone can speak, read, and write like a native.Author Alexander da R. Prista does a great job compiling the essential of the language in this 114-page book. Although the small font size might be something that might make it difficult for anyone with a visual impairment to read, however the book is well researched and organized. If you're preparing for a trip to Brazil, Portugal, or anywhere in Portuguese-speaking Africa, this book makes a great buy and investment for anyone interested in travel or business in these areas."
3,Same old song and dance...,"This book is good in one way: it is very short and doesn't waste your time. If you want to read Portuguese, this is a useful book. If you actually want to converse with Brazilians, you're going to need a lot more than this, but I don't know that any book really and truly covers spoken Brazilian Portuguese. Most of the grammars you will find are trying to uphold the outdated ideals of so called ""educated"" portuguese but nobody talks like this anymore. It's as pity. If anyone knows of a book that really does this, please, do us all a favor and recommend it here. I would love to get my hands on a true guide to modern spoken Portuguese before I return to Brazil."
4,yogagirl,The book was in great condition as it said and my son loves this story. I just wish that it would have said that it was a very small book (maybe I missed the dimensions somewhere). I was very surprised how small it was when it came.
2,Great Career Change or Second Income Home Business Ideas,"You may want a home business for a second income, or maybe a whole career change - there are thousands of options for earning a living now. I started homebusinessadvisers.com in 2004, and this is a book I read in preparation. It was useful for an over 40 woman like me. There is so much info around, it's hard to filter through it. In the end my own website has become a place to review the latest home based business ideas. Thanks to Priscilla for the initial ideas."
4,Please forgive me,"You may not post my review, but I had to let you know what helped me. I am a woman who has stayed at home with my precious babies for 6 years. Now, I need a little extra income to help pay tuition for all 4 of them. The reviewer from Illiois who wrote, a waiste of time and money, helped me, because I'm not looking to start a career. I am proud to be a ""MOMMY"" as she so sarcastically put it. I plan to get your book as a result of her bad comments about it. Thank you."
2,Should have gone to the library,Buying this book was a waste of money... I would have done better to do research on the web or to have gone to the library. Hardly any useful information.
3,Not a book for the 21st century,I think that Ms Huff should rethink her strategies here.This book is okay but does not really deal with the realities of the 21st century.If you're looking for a book that faces the realities and challenges of today then you should read Untapped Wealth Discovered by Jeff Marquis and Kerry Harrison. This book shows you how to find those businesses that can survive and prosper in our economy. It's a book that pays special attentions to the needs and goals of women.
1,Pass on this one,This book stinks. It's filled with a little of everything but not enough of the right information. Pass... if you really want to see the book check it out of the library and save the money.
4,A Good First Step,"I conduct workshops based on my book ""Capitalizing On Being Woman Owned"" and in almost every class 30% of the attendees are in the first stages of starting a business or even just thinking about it. This book would be a good exploratory resource for them. Ms. Huff provides practical information for many micro-businesses. Part of the book is a ""how-to"" with explanations for making critical decisions. It is a great first exposure to starting a business and provides resources that will give the details. It's probably not for the woman who wants to build an international corporation. But it is for the woman who wants to start a small business that suits her personality and situation."
2,NO ES LA GRAN COSA,EN LO PERSONAL ESTOY ARREPENTIDO DE HABER COMPRADO LA PELICULA PERO .... HAY GUSTO PARA TODOS
4,Not that bad!,"I thought this film was humorous. It has some slow parts, but was overall enjoyable. It is not as bad as these reviews say."
1,NOT MUCH USE,"I saw this workshop and bought the book to see if there were more useful items within it because the author's presentation was not something I was inspired by. I would recommend reading Andrew Weil, not Cohen's book."
4,Sturdy and Attractive,I just installed some of these doorknobs in my house today. They are sturdy and attractive. It was very easy to reverse the knob to switch from left-hand to right-hand. You basically push a small tool into a hole to pop off the handles and then switch them.My only complaint is that they did not come with an optional square-corner face plates for the area around the latch and the strike plate. It comes with a rounded corner only.
5,Great product,I put these knobs in both my house and cabin. It's totally worth the money and effort to update door knobs. It helps for installation if the prior knobs are by the same company.
5,"Great looking, sturdy lever","Easy to install, looks very nice, & heavy duty. High quality lock that should last a long time. I did a lot of research & read several Amazon reviews and am very pleased with this choice. The lever is easy to change from left- to right- handed."
3,DOOR LEVER,"Within 5 minutes of ordering this product, I needed to make an adjustment to the order. I immediately sent an e-mail to the seller explaining that I needed to cancel the order and place a new order. The e-mail was ignored, never answered, the order sent out. Making the return was inconvenient, but Amazon gave the credit right away. I never unpacked the box, I just returned it. It was received by a neighbor because I wasn't home or I never would have accepted it! Needless to say, I didn't place a new order with this company."
3,Object on internet are larger than they appear.,"This product is mislabeled on the heading. These are OVERSIZED goblets and are actually a little too big for my purposes. Oh well, they're good quality otherwise."
3,"Nice, but too big.","They call these goblets ""tall"" here, but when you get them they say ""oversized"". I was hoping for a tall stem and regular-sized bowl to the glass, but it is both tall and has a huge bowl. Not what I was hoping for."
4,Nice Wine Glass for the Price,"I was concerned when I placed my order for these glasses because of the reviews stating that they were ""huge"". When they arrived, I found them to be just right. A regular pour will certainly not fill the glass, but that is the design. The stem is taller than a regular wine glass and the bowl is taller as well, but it is a very nice shape that reminds me of the larger, more dramatic wine glasses that you find in fine restaurants. The glass is not sheer, and does not have a sheer rim (there is a slight lip on the bowl), but I did not expect to receive glassware of such quality at this pricepoint. All-in-all, this is a pretty glass that is affordable and would be great if you are ordering multiple sets for a party as I did."
1,They crack if you breathe on them.,"I like the size, shape and feel of the glass. But two of them broke in the first few days we had them. If ANYTHING touches them, they will crack. The glass must not be tempered correcly. Made in the USA, too. I'm very disappointed."
1,SMASHED!,Poorly packaged box of broken glass! Stay away from this company. Shattered glass in a box! These people are nuts!
4,A little bit of everything,This book covers just about everything you could ever want to know about lesbian sex. More then a few friends have borrowed this book out of curiosity. They all found this book to be very interesting.
3,"More political and cultural than anything, but worth a look","I got little that could help me in my situation as a latebloomer, but did find this book informative in a political/cultural way in addition to gaining greater insight into what some of my transgendered friends have gone through. It has some good articles on the power behind strapping it on, kink, the butch/femme issue, etc. I found this to be a good primer to the history of the community, with some interesting detours along the way."
3,O.K. but over done,"It went nuts on Elvis...if he burped at a bus stop... they told you where and when. Some good basic info on Memphis and the Elvis history, but a lot of fill."
1,2 pieces short,This product arrived 2 pieces short. I called and it was incredibly difficult to get it rectified. I tried to post exactly what happened per the transaction but was blocked by amazon. In the end I would have had to send the whole case back to amazon. Wait for it to get processed again and then for it to be shipped back to me. Completly negating the extra money I paid to have it shipped quickly. It would have been much easier if they just sent the 2 pieces that were not packaged in the original shippment.
1,The Black Roadbed Track is the Cheap Stuff,"The black is the cheap steel track that comes with the starter sets. If you are serious about expanding, buy the gray roadbed track."
2,common sense will tell you,"I live in Maine and am somewhat familar with the Canadian culture...perhaps this is why I gave this book such a poor rating. But I found it to be so general in its information that I too wonder just what audience this book is written for? Most of the content seemed just common sense to me and if your from the northeast then a basic sense of climate and its effects can guide you. I had hoped it would have delved greater into the social/family culture and more on their views of American or contrasts of other cultures than the brief page it offered. I will however now subscribe to Macleans magazine, the Canadian equivalent of the Times or Newsweek here in the states, and also the national newspaper from Toronto, The Globe and Mail, to further my knowledge of this great neighbor to the north."
2,Not that great.,"This book is very hard to read and understand.It contains many sections that are poorly organized and also has a few mistakes.It is more oriented for an SAT tutor than a student.However, it is very thorough, and if that is what you are looking for you should consider buying this.Personally, I see it as a waste of 20 dollars. There are better books out there. TryThe Official SAT Study Guide,Barron's SAT 2400: Aiming for the Perfect Score, among others..."
4,Full of Surprises!,Read my review for this under the Laura Ashley Bramble Twin Comforter set. Buyer beware!
5,Woman Friendly!,"I purchased this for my trolling motor as my brother kept on me about getting a battery charger - marine type. Anyway, it works just great and from my perspective, no second guessing, just simple hook it up and forget it! I now have the confidence that I am not overcharging, that I won't get stuck out in the middle of our lake with a drained battery and that my brother is now a happy fisherman as he comes up to the lake and uses MY pontoon and trolling motor which now always has a fully charged battery!!!! Hooray for simplicity and excellence in quality!"
5,Hook it up and forget it!,Easy to use right out of the box. Hook it up and forget it! That's the convenience of this charger. Well worth the price to have peace of mind and that when I'm ready to use the battery it's fully charged and ready to go!
5,Best Packer program ever,"I was really impressed with the quality of this program. I've followed the Packers all my life, but I've never heard the players tell some of these stories before. And the old footage was cool. Especially the Ice Bowl."
2,Copy Protected Maxi!!,"I just received my Maxi, I ordered!! Was thrilled but was really disappointed 'cuz it is copy protected :( I hate these new copy protected CDs theyre a pain! Guess I can still tranfer to my ole walkman but wouldve loved to copy to my HD and play on my mp3 player. Oh well, if youre really interested in a copy protected CD then choose this one else, ;) opt for something else. Why I gave it so few stars. Besides I am a big fan of La Bouche, I say by the US maxi has better and more songs on CD."
3,Beautiful designs like Frontgate,"I'm looking forward to receiving my magazine subscription, based on all the wonderful reviews here. BUYING TIP: I'm going to receive a one year subscription to this mag FREE with $100 order from Frontgate.Follow up - I found that once the subscription started I didn't find it that interesting and would briefly flip through the pages, if that. I'm glad it was a free subscription and didn't renew it."
4,The ideas are very pricey,First this magazine only comes 8 times a year. Being that it is so infrequent you would think the publisher would have a chance to write more articles. Instead this magazine is heavy on pictures light on articles. The items that show are really nice and you instantly want to rush out and buy them until you see the price tag (several thousand for a chair) it is definitly a high end magazine. You will need to easily earn 6 figures to buy the things you see in the magazine. However for ideas this is priceless my wife and I are always getting ideas for our house from Traditional Home. Be aware there are more adds than typical in Traditional Home.
5,Great,So hilarious great comedy!! All without the disgust of foul language or inappropriate situations that exist in most movies of today.
4,If you Like The Marx Brothers you'll enjoy this.,"This DVD is doggone good quality and original black & white, audio is also pretty good quality, I'm sure some restoration has been done but the character and continuity remains unscathed.Like I was saying before, if you like the more obscure Marx Brothers films this would be a good addition to your library."
3,A little slow,"Both films get a little tedious. Go West never really gets off the ground in fact, and does not benefit from some vignette gems that are in The Big Store. There are, as always, some quick-witted one-liners by Graucho along with the de rigeuer Chico and Harpo performances. Not to be missed in The Big Store is the famous ""mirrors"" scene with the inimitable Harpo - wonderful! And the most amazing piece of work, especially for its time, is the ""Tenement Symphony,"" surprising in its frankness and yet poignant in the guise of entertainment so badly needed during the depression and wartime Europe. There are, again, sparks from Graucho, some of which are quite fun. Worthy of purchase."
4,El mejor disco recopilado,"Para todos los fans de los héroes del silencio aquí tienen las mejores canciones del todo el directorio de este grupo. Este disco contiene algunos temas remozados, que han sido cantados nuevamente por Enrique Bunbury, pero yo me imaginé que todos los temas habían sido cantados de nuevo. Los temas en vivo creo que están de mas no cuadran muy bien en el disco, pero a pesar de mis críticas, este es un disco que vale la pena que lo tengas, temas como ""flor venenosa"", ""agosto"", ""fuente esperanza"" ""tesoro"" y el remix espectacular de ""el camino del exceso"", le dan a este disco un toque diferente que al de los discos anteriores de su carrera musical. Los héroes del silencio son y por siempre seran la mejor banda de rock en español. Viva los Héroes!!!!!"
5,A hit with the kids!,"We all loved ""Cooking Art"" but especially my children. They loved looking through the illustrations, making the recipes and especially eating their ""creations"". One of their favorites was the ""Zucchini Train"". There's just something special about eating something that you yourself have created. Even my finicky eater licked his plate clean! The recipes are easy to do and if you don't have one of the ingredients it's easy to make substitutions. In fact, that's one of the best parts about the book, it gets you thinking how to be creative on your own. The possibilities are endless!"
5,Easy Edible Art,"I like this cook book because it encourages art and creativity, but food is not wasted, it is eaten (gobbled!!). Maybe some child will become a chef in a fancy five star restaurant because of these activities? It's just good fun that tastes good too."
2,No Pictures!!,"This book did not have any color pictures in it. It was all black and white drawings. It was not what I expected at all. It does have a lot of activities, but if I had seen the inside of the book first, I would not have bought it."
2,Just wish it was in color,"There are some very good ideas in the book, I just wish it were in full color. There are plenty of drawn explanations however so if you are just looking for instructions that are easy to follow then this book has it."
3,Mostly Forgettable with a Few Memorable Songs,"I bought this CD for ""Happy."" I'd heard the song and couldn't get it out of my head. This CD does, indeed, have that song, and I still love it, but most of the other songs on the CD turned out to be fairly uninspired pop songs.The first, tenth, eleventh, and thirteenth tracks are by far the songs I like best on this CD. The first one, in particular, I like nearly as much as ""Happy.""Overall, I'm glad I bought the CD, but this isn't a CD that I can simply listen to from start to finish on a regular basis."
4,Very comforting.,I gave this book as a gift and it was received with great appreciation. A unique book and very comforting.
2,Credulous,"If you believe in ancient astronauts (a la Chariots of the Gods), then you might like this book. If not, stay away."
3,First half is good,"First half is good and is about a trip up the Missouri. It's always refreshing to read an account by a non-fur-trader.Later on he takes a boat full of lead down to New Orleans on the Mississippi and gets caught in the middle of the famous New Madrid earthquakes which is pretty incredible.The second half is all appendixes consisting of Indian language vocabularies and deadly boring descriptions of some frontier regions' geology. The one exception is the newspaper story about the other Astorians' travels over the Rockies and down the Columbia, which is good.I read the version with the Reuben Gold Thwaites footnotes and they were pretty irritating, just a lot of irrelevant historical and geographical detail.I read the PDF and the price was right, i.e., zero. I wouldn't pay a lot for this unless you're a real completist."
5,Bradbury himself appeals to me,"I suppose anyone who would make that trip would have to be intrepid, but he seemed really to be.The thing I like the most about him is that he was such a civilized person. A gentle, intelligent, well educated, modest, and very friendly person.The other review about his insights into what he was describing is, in my mind, quite correct also.I may be a bit prejudiced and certainly am more interested because my middle name is Bradbury as a result of being a descendent of his."
5,Delicious Wheat Crackers,The Wheat Thins Lo-Sodium Crackers are delicious. I especially appreciate the lo-sodium feature. It is just right. I will order this item again and again.
5,Great flavor and SO FRESH,"I find many snack foods too salty for my taste. These are perfect!And, ordering through Amazon, they are SO FRESH and crunchy!It's the next-best thing to lembas bread!"
2,Tastes Greasy,"Okay, not great. I am donating the rest of them to the local Food Bank only because I know many people like them just as they are...I am not one of them.I rated them 2 star because I appreciate the low sodium effort."
3,Wheat Thins Low Sodium,"Wheat Thins Low Sodium was what I ordered and I received Wheat Thins Hint of Salt. Although it would seem to be the same product I taste a difference from the original ""Low Sodium"".... seems leave a different after taste that I do not like."
1,Cardboard,"I was looking for a tasty cracker that would go well with hummus or cheese or dip. These things taste like cardboard and turn to sticky glue after one bite. They have no flavor whatsoever. Not even salt or a good dip could save these molded wheat flour stamps. And if you think they're healthy, you're wrong: the main ingredient is ""enriched wheat flour"", which is basically sugar. Fritos are better for you than this."
4,Picture in the book,"I am lived in Hong Kong, and would like to advise that I cannot be know how many picture in the book. (Just on the content or search in computer) Thanks"
2,Anyone Else Have Trouble with 2.4 Ghz Phone?,"This monitor seemed to work well the one night I used it...but the very next day my 2.4 GHz cordless phone showed OUT OF RANGE on the handset-- meaning it could no longer find the cordless phone station and I could no longer make or receive calls. I unplugged both the parent and child units for the monitor, but my phone is still not working. The phone is downstairs in the kitchen and both units were upstairs in the bedrooms. My phone has never shown OUT OF RANGE in the 12+ months that I have had it. I don't know if this is a coincidence, but I am concerned that the first night's use of this 2.4 GHz monitor coincided with my 2.4 GHz phone no longer working."
3,Didn't Meet Expectations,"I was hoping this wireless monitor would work better (and farther, without interference) than my current monitor, the Fisher Price Sound n' Lights. Well, not only is the range not as great as that of my old monitor, but the interference and static made this monitor less than impressive. I used this monitor in cabins out in the country, where there was no phone or internet; the interference and static occured whenever the wind blew. The only positive thing I can say about it is that it's wireless. I'm getting a refund."
1,I really wanted to like this,"I loved the idea of the long range and that the child and parent unit could be used with batteries. Unfortunately, I also had the loud beeping in the middle of the night. I made sure that both units were on the same channel and it happened a second time. I returned it today and I am very disappointed about it."
3,Disappointing sound quality,"We have a 49MHz baby monitor, and had problems with interference and hissing, so we bought this model based on the reviews and supposed sound quality. Unfortunately for us this unit was a disappointment, we actually experienced no improvement in sound quality compared to the original baby monitor (Evenflo brand). I was very surprised, since we have 2.4GHz cordless phones and the sound quality is excellent, maybe the phone is interfering with the baby monitor. In any case, we were very disappointed and would not recommend this model."
1,Product sucks,"I've just bought 2.4GHz ultra-range monitor and for my surprise after I installed following de instructions it just wouldn't work without very loud interference. I've tried to use in a different house, several blocks away, and the problem remained.I've tried to turned off all the electronic equipment (even the TV) at my house and the interference wouldn't go away. It's a shamed that an expensive baby monitor like this would have basic problem just like a cheap and low quality model."
1,DON'T BUY,"We were given this monitor 2 years ago and never really used it with our first child. We started really using it with our second child and would leave the parent control on the stereo receiver.Due to some interference one day, I placed it directly onto our bookcase. My husband noticed sometime later that day, that it had burned a hole in the bookcase! Thank God he caught it in time!! He immediately threw it in the trash. I have yet to contact the manufacturer, but I will."
1,Fatal flaw,"This monitor is 95% great; pocket-sized, 2.4GHz for lowinterference, rechargable batteries come with it (qty 3 AAA)and acceptable range. But the ""finder"" mis-feature kills thisproduct (press a button on the nursery unit and the parentunit will beep loudly for 20 seconds); the utility isquestionable (the parent unit has to be on for it to work)and the false triggers in the dead of night--wakingeveryone--will leave you wanting to run it through yourgarbage disposal. The company has replaced both sender &receiver, and we've replaced the batteries, but have onlyreduced, not eliminated the problem."
3,I wouldn't buy this one,"We bought a monitor originally becuse we were in a two story house and couldn't hear the baby when we were downstairs. It worked very well for about 6 months. I agree with the other reviewers that it did tend to pick up a lot of ""extra"" noise, but I could always hear when tha baby was rustling around so it was OK. At about the 7 month mark, the alarm feature on the parent unit started to go off for no reason, at all times of the day or night. We contacted the company who suggested there was a problem with the batteries or call feature, so they sent us a new parent unit for free. But the new unit also continued to go off for no reason we could ever figure. We looked at interference from the phone, the computer, anything! Since it would go off on an average of every one to two hours, costing us and the baby valuable sleep time, we finally gave it up and are buying a new one. I'm too tired not to!"
2,Do not buy if you have a 2.4 GHZ phone,"I put this monitor on my registry because the description said that it had excellent range and it had good reviews. Well it does have good range but there is so much static and interference that I can hardly stand to use it. I called The First Years customer service because I thought there had to be something wrong with it and they simply said, if you have a 2.4 GHZ cordless phone in your house, this monitor is not for you. I wish I knew that before I got it! I got it as a gift, don't have the box anymore and have to go out and buy a new one. I told the customer service rep that I also have a 900 MHZ phone in my house and she said then I need to get a monitor that is not in that range either. Hope this info helps!"
2,Before purchasing: check your cordless phone!!!,"This monitor worked like a charm before we purchased a 2.4Ghz cordless phone set (2 units; one plugs into an ordinary outlet & doesn't need a phone jack). Since the monitor and the phones are on the same frequency, the result is a constant static/clicking noise that is horrible. One solution: unplug the phones at night (or when you're using the monitor)... but make sure you have an ""old fashioned"", corded phone close by in case you get an incoming call. Also, if you decide to unplug the phones, you'd have to reset the date & time every day if the main unit has an answering machine built-in. Too much trouble for us; we're getting a new ""non 2.4Ghz"" monitor."
2,Watch out if you have a wireless network!,"We have been using this monitor for 6 months. It picks up a lot of intereference from the wireless network in our home. Everytime you download something or surf the net, it crackles and buzzes. There is also a constant (albeit faint) clicking sound in the background. Considering how expensive this monitor is, I wish I had shopped around a bit more."
5,Great monitor,"I agree with the recent 5 star reviews. I read these reviews before purchasing this monitor, and I coulnd't be more pleased. As a new mom, I didn't have any prior monitor experience...so the reviews were invaluable. This monitor has been working very well. No interference. It made a lound squealing noise only when I brought the parent unit and set it too close to the baby unit. It is nice and sensitive for our peace of mind. I can even hear our baby girl breathing. The lights are also a nice addition. I can blow dry my hair and ""see"" that the monitor is not picking up any loud cries.I highly recommend this monitor."
2,Location BEEP at 3am,"We found that the range and clarity were excellent, but the parent unit experienced interference causing sleep depriving clicks. Also - the loud BEEP BEEP BEEP alarm that emits from the parent unit for no discernable reason between 2:30 and 3:30 am will have your heart racing, and you searching for another product. (Strangely this is the exact time that others have found the alarm sounds)"
1,GOOD RANGE & CLARITY BUT.....TERRIBLE INTERFERENCE!!!!!,"I get this baby monitor from my Baby Shower, but I kepp it for 1 month this monitor has good range and clarity but the parent unit present interference using the microwave and the cordless phone 2.4 Ghz.also is crazy in any time emits alarm loud sounds....BEEP.BEEP,BEEP,BEEP whitout reason.Now I have the new 900 MHZ Fisher Price with 2 parents units,1 parents unit comes with vibrates & Short antenna has excellent clarity . no more interference or Beeps"
1,Horrible,This monitor was an absolute piece of junk. We finally broke down and threw it away after listening to static and wondering if our children were awake or not.
2,Monitor Gone Bad,"We've had this monitor for a little over a year. All of a sudden it started making loud beeping sounds, like it was paging itself. This only occurred on the parent unit, but it happened about 6 times throughout the night. When we turned the unit off, & then turned it back on, the beeping stopped. We used an Evenflo monitor with my first child & never had a problem with it."
1,Don't buy if you have Wi-Fi,"It is important for people to know that if you have a wireless network in your house, that it cannot share the same frequencies at any other 2.4 Ghz devices. This includes baby monitors and cordless telephones. The correct arrangement should be:Baby Monitor: 900 Mhz Digital-Spread-Spectrum (DSS)WiFi Netowrk: 2.4 GhzCordless Telephone: 5.8 Ghz Digital-Spread-Spectrum (DSS)"
3,A lot of static,"Though we can hear our son with is monitor, I feel there is a lot of background static. We experience a lot of interference (static) on the monitor with our wireless network and cordless phone."
1,"Horrible, Horrible, Horrible","My baby who we adopted came into my home with little notice I bought the first monitor I could find which was about $15. This worked fine for us until we needed one that had a longer range. I then spend 4 times the amount of money that the initial one cost and purchased this one. My baby was left in his crib crying for the first time in his life due to this. 3 times it happened! Each time I checked the channel, charge etc and this was not due to user error but due to the product not working. Did not pick up my babies loud crying!!"
1,Clear and Near It's NOT!,"We bought this monitor when our daughter was born so that we could have a monitor in each of our child's rooms. Although we did not have any problems with the two monitors interfering, this monitor has so much static that it is barely functional. I don't see any improvement in the range over our original First Years monitor that we owned and loved. The static of this Clear and Near monitor is so horrible some nights that it makes sleeping difficult. We have debated throwing it out and starting again many times, but given how much we paid for it we haven't done it yet. We just found out we are expecting our 3rd child and will be switching over to the monitor that allows receivers in 3 different locations. Finally, a good excuse to get rid of this piece of garbage!"
5,Excellent monitor. Highly recommend,I've heard from many new parents that they've been struggling to find good monitors. This monitor was the first one I bought and I absolutely love it. Now if they could only come up with extra thing like electric discharge that would wake up my husband :))
1,Range is terrible,"The range even when the base was placed near a window was between 200-300 feet. This is with no close obstructions, only a 15 feet change in elevation, and at most one house between us in the way. I didn't get anywhere near the range advertised.On the plus side, Amazon accepted the return without a problem."
4,"The monitor works great, once I got it to work","The reason I am writing this review is because several reviewers said that their monitors did not work properly. When I received my monitor, the parent unit was defective. It would not charge the batteries. However, I wanted to say that I called the First Years and they were extremely helpful and timely. They immediately sent new batteries, and when that didn't work, they sent a new parent unit. Their customer services was excellent. They were helpful, cordial, and worked with me to solve the problem. Once I received a properly working unit, everything worked great.So, my point being is that if your monitor does not work right, please call the manufacturer first before you give up. They will work with you to make it right. Now that it works, I love this monitor much better then the Sony one I received for a shower gift. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I had call the company."
1,You WILL get the BEEPING,"I bought this item despite the reviews saying it beeped in the middle of the night. There were so many good reviews I thought the beeping was a fluke. The monitor worked GREAT for the first three months. Since then, it randomly beeps - often in the middle of the night. Its loud, its scary, and it disrupts sleep! Do not buy this monitor!!"
1,Writing this review in a sleepy daze....,"I'll echo the other reviews - this is a great monitor until it wakes you up in the middle of the night with that infernal beeping (2:30 AM last night!). I've tried both channels, no luck. I thought it might be our house, so we took it with us to the beach for a week and it did it there, too.Those of you lucky enough to get this to work without the alarm going off are fortunate - when it works, it's clear as a bell and has long range. But with this unpredictable beeping, it's pretty much worthless."
2,"Decent monitor, but occasional random loud alarm sounds","For a couple of days I was very happy with this monitor (I bought two to replace 900 Mhz First Years monitors that worked OK, but with some interference). Then at 3:00 a.m. a piercing alarm sounded from one of the new parent units - just as others have described. Bizarre. I don't have a 2.4 Ghz phone or other obvious interference. I'll be returning both monitors unless I get a fix from First Years."
5,Excellent monitor,"We were given a cheap monitor, but there was almost always static or humming. We bought this one because of the reviews and we couldn't be any happier. It is very clear, we can always hear the baby and every little noise she makes. This monitor is definitely worth the extra money."
3,Clear and loud beeping at 3AM guaranteed!,"This monitor works very well, until the time when you really need to use it: at night. There is a ""finder"" function for the parent unit, and apparently interference will cause it to go off. Well, I'm now on my third set of this particular monitor, which means that it is not a QA issue but interference in my home. It's unfortunate, as the volume from the monitor is quite loud and it is quite easy to hear my child's softest cries.I hope I can find a comparable monitor that will still offer the same features but without the ""finder"" function. If the monitor didn't have that feature I would have never known of the interference issue."
2,Not worth the money,"This monitor is definitely not as good as it claims to be. There is constant clicking and static in the background, and sometimes it doesn't even pick up the baby crying. Like some of the other reviewers said, the alarm on the parent unit goes off for no apparent reason at all, sometimes every 10 minutes. It's nice that this monitor is rechargeable, but that's about it. For $60 I could have gotten a much better monitor."
1,Case is too tight,I just received this item. Camera case is too small for Leica D-Lux 3 camera. I even think I scratched the LCD display in trying to see if fits. Cover closes too tight over the lense with lence cap on. I am returning this right away.
1,This is a terrible product.,"This is a terrible product. I did not believe the other reviewer and went ahead and ordered this product, thinking ""How could Leica sell a case that did not fit their camera?"" I was wrong. This case does *not* fit a D-LUX 3 at all. Moreover, the quality is so poor that Leica should be embarrassed to put their name on it. It feels like it is made of cardboard with a thin layer of leather glued onto it. Even if I were able to force the camera into this case and somehow managed to close the cover, which latches via a magnet, the camera could easily fall out. It has a belt loop, but I don't think it would be strong enough to survive a single use. Do yourself a favor, DON'T buy this case."
3,Camera fits fine--questionable durability,"I am not sure why the other reviewers have an issue with the camera fitting into the case. The camera fits in the case very well. The camera must be inserted into the case in a certain direction (flash end in first), so I can only guess they might have tried to force the camera in the wrong way.I agree the leather is quite thin on the case. I don't feel this case is of the quality I have seen from other manufacturers. The belt loop is very small and the leather thin. Repeated use might stretch the strap beyond the breaking point--I will have to see over time.I agree this case is not of the same quality as the great camera that should fit inside."
1,Sounds Like a Jet Taking Off,"This is the first product I purchased from Amazon that I have sent back for a refund. I was very disappointed with this Hunter fan. The product was packed well and had no visible damage. The reviews and word of mouth about Hunter fans led me to believe that this fan would be ""Whisper Quiet"". The unit did have power and circulated air efficiently but it was so loud it was annoying even on the lowest speed. I wouldn't recommend this fan to anyone that has a normal hearing range."
5,Nice fan,"This is a nice looking and sturdy fan. I wanted something to use as a bedroom fan so I was concerned about noise which is why I chose this one over the 10"". I have to say that even at a low setting it puts out a good amount of air with a reasonably low volume. I'm a light sleeper and I keep it oscillating but I haven't had any problems. I'd recommend this for anyone who likes the look and would like a medium to high air volume fan with minimal noise."
3,"ok fan, play your music a little louder.","I bought this fan because I liked the design and know hunter puts out pretty good quality stuff. After a few weeks, I've come to realize that this is a pretty noisy fan. It oscilates pretty fast and blows well, but you will hear it. Not really worth the cost for the design if that is a big deal to you. It appears to be well built, but with the technology that we have now, you'd think they'd be able to make a fan quieter. Oh well, I still have the fan on, but just have to play my music a little louder."
1,looks great!,"This fan was just what I wanted! It was shipped very quickly. It looks great! It worked great for one whole day. It quit oscillating and just made a grinding sound. I returned it, that was easy; thanks Amazon. I thought I was buying the best. I was wrong. I hope Amazon gives me my money back."
3,"Nice, but loud","It looks nice, is sturdy, moves a lot of air, but it is *not* quiet on low. I have box fans that are about the same volume."
1,Don't be fooled. Hunter makes junk.,"I was impressed with the heft of this fan. The noise level on medium was perfect for ""white noise"" for sleeping. I rarely used it on oscillate and I kept it clean. Without warning, it stopped reaching normal speed on M and on L. It often wouldn't even start unless I started it on high first. Now, any speed other than high is barely a whisper. I contacted Hunter (which happens to be a local company here), they said the fan cannot be serviced. Well of course not. Things aren't made to be serviced; they're made to be replaced. Ridiculous. I'll try to see if it's worth taking it to a small appliance repair shop. On a related note, I also had to return a programmable thermostat manufactured by Hunter. Total junk. Hunter is on my bad side."
5,This is a GREAT fan!,"I was looking for a really top quality, great-looking fan. One that looked and felt like it was made way back when things were built incredibly well and lasted a long time.I kind of laugh at the fact that I had a cheapo, plastic Cool Breeze fan for so long. This fan is built like a tank, and looks sleek, retro, and all around beautiful. Its pretty darn heavy and I love the solid feel. All the knobs and lever are brushed nickel. I feel like one typically needs to pay way more than $50 for such quality, but not here. This is a GREAT fan and I'm super happy with my purchase."
5,Perfect kitchen counter fan,"The fan is a great addition to my kitchen. Whether on high, medium or low, it creates a pleasant breeze that reaches through my medium-sized kitchen and my breakfast nook. When not in use, it fits perfectly on the kitchen counter under an upper cabinet. In use, it operates smoothly whether fixed or rotating, with a pleasant hum. The satin black and brushed nickel finish go well with my black appliances and oil rubbed bronze fixtures. It would be beautiful also with stainless steel, chrome or brushed nickel appliances and fixtures. A great buy for a functional and beautiful addition to my kitchen at a good price."
2,Just OK,Cheaply made and noisy. Doesn't cool very well or move the air around. Ok for spot cooling. Trying to return it is also a hassle. Would not recommend.
2,Great looking - poor performance,"I bought this fan nearly a month ago. It started off fine, though definitely not ""whisper quiet"". I'm convinced the cage and blades are too heavy. The blades have begun to hit the side, the cage won't stay tight, and the motor is very loud. Plus the clicking noise it makes will drive you crazy. This is a real disappointment! I bought online because the black version of this Hunter isn't available in stores. Now I intend to return it and swith to the more reliable Vornado brand. Hunter has a good rep for ceiling fans, but for whatever reason this oscillating version just doesn't cut it."
5,Love. This. Fan.,"This fan is wonderful. It's got three speed settings, a sleek retro style, it's quite substantial in weight, and the grate around the fan blades is fine enough to keep little fingers and tails safely out of harms way. The grate is easily removed with a screw driver for cleaning.I keep this fan running constantly - literally. I've been known to leave it on for days on end and I've had it for several months. It's still as quiet as the day I bought it. The only sound it makes is the air moving, the motor is silent as well as the oscillations. This is a high quality fan worth every penny."
5,Hunter 90022 Century 12-Inch Performance Oscillating Fan,"This is a tough little fan. My husband and I was very surprise in the way how it was constructed. We looked it over for plastic parts and nun was detected. I am going to perches a few more. For those who think that the fan is a bit loud try this, put a towel or a peace of flat Foam under it to absorb vibrations and that should eliminate some noise transferring directly on to the surface you have it on. Be sure that the fan is well balance on the towel or cloth."
1,"Not Quite DOA, but close ...","Fan arrived on time, packaging in good condition. Oscillation gear box broke within 10 days. Returned to Amazon and gift card refunded. Smooth transaction; shame about the fan. I own another of the identical model that I've had for years, and never had an issue with it."
2,Not so quiet,"I have had other fans that cost much less then this fan and did not make as much noise as this one makes. It works fine, I wanted it for my bedroom but it is loud. I but my old fan back in my bedroom and put this one in another room. If you are looking for a quiet fan keep looking"
1,disappointed.,"This fan was great for a few days and then just stopped oscillating. Out of nowhere, just stopped working. I have to figure out where to send it and try to have it repaired, which is a huge inconvenience to say the least. Has anyone else had a problem like this? And if so, what did you do? Thanks."
2,NOT AS STRONG AS I WOULD LIKE,"I replaced a broken fan (Vornato..or something like that) with this because it looked pretty and for the most part, got good reviews. I just recieved it and it is pretty, but it is not a strong current. I am very disapointed. I don't know if I will send it back, but it doesn't have the reach of wind power that I expected it to have. I have it all the way up, and it is quiet, it is heavily constructed, and doesn't have that ""tick tick"" noise some said theirs did when it oscalates. But why they couldn't make it stronger I don't know... this is my second fan I'm trying, I don't have the energy to send it back...sigh..."
5,I'm a big fan,"I'm thrilled with this metal fan from Hunter, all the more so when I compare it to other small- to medium-sized oscillating fans. The construction is sturdier and the appearance is appealing and clean. While not totally silent, the ""whispering"" motor is not bothersome. Even on the first (of three) speeds, the fan is effective. In short, I'm delighted. Hurray for Hunter."
4,not quiet enough,"This fan is good and looks great, but I wish there was a lower speed. The lowest speed on this fan feels and sounds like a medium level breeze to me. It would be nice to have a quieter, gentler choice. It also makes a little noise when it reaches the edge of the oscillating arc, which can be annoying. I bought it for the bedroom, but am now using it in our family room instead."
2,Too Noisy,"I live in an attic apartment, which means it is important to keep the air flowing. So I have at least one fan in every room. Of all the fans I own, this one is by far the noisiest. The WHIR it emits is so loud that I generally prefer to not use it. If that kind of thing doesn't matter to you, then I can say that otherwise the fan is great - solidly built, and stylish to look at. But for me, if it's too loud, it's useless."
1,Ugly,"This is a very ugly stuffed animal. It's not soft and fluffy, but wiry and stringy. I will not be giving it as a gift, nor to a toy drive!"
2,disappointed...,"The Webkinz Golden Retriever had very thready sparse hair, was notcuddly in any way, and very overpriced! It probably is useful only as a way into the webkinz website...The demand for Webkinz toys is beyond whatthe company can produce, and I don't think they are worth the cost."
5,webkinz world,I have a webkinz it is a awsome place to play and go places like a masion.I like this product because you have a room you can go to arcade and you can get to adopt a pet. I would buy it again because it as wounderful games.
4,We love Webkinz!!,"My daughter has been collecting Webkinz since January. The Golden Retriever is so cute -- both for real and animated! These toys are great -- not only do you get an adorable stuffed animal to play with, but you can bring them to life on-line and play games with them and feed and clothe them. My daughter has developed quite a sense for shopping and how to wisely spend her money on items she wants and needs using KinzCash. She knows if she wants to buy something for her pets, she needs to go out and earn the money through playing the games -- which are fun and some are even educational."
5,RUFF RUFF,"paid $5 for it, its a nice little dog but doesn't look like a golden retriever at all, the ""fur"" is distracting after just a few minutes"
1,"Horrible web interface, very frustrating, brainwashing. Just nasty!","Don't buy this product! This is the first item I have ever written a review about. The web interface is absolutely dreadful. I'm a Flash developer and I've never seen such junk. Slow, clunky, quite complex to do much of anything, nothing intuitive. Certainly, no kid less then 10-12 will be able to figure out what to do.There is also an insidious sell sell sell buy buy buy message from the site. Reminds me of some Orwellian brain washing program. Go buy your kind a stomp rocked and get out side."
5,Webkinz Golden Retriever Review,"I bought this for my grand daughter with a lot of other Webkinz that she plays with along with a Webkinz membership on the internet game where you register all of your plushable pets. Although you don't really get to do any interactive things with your plush pets she does have them all around her computer when she plays her game. They are very durable and the Golden Retriever is so cute and she (my grand daughter) has a golden retriever in real life so I thought she would enjoy having the Webkinz Golden Retriever, grandma was so right! The Webkinz Golden Retriever would make a great pet for any child though because it is so soft and hugable!"
5,Webkinz,"My son loves Webkinz. It teaches him responsibility, in the way he has to take care of it (i.e. feed it, get a job for it to make money for food, and other items). We received it quickly."
2,Ruff!,"I was surprised to find how ruff the fur is on this dog. We ordered the lab (wonderfully soft) and the golden retriever at the same time. The golden is so stringy and ruff it can only be used as a decoration, not an animal to be slept with.The website is fine but you must purchase a web kin every year to keep up the membership and play with toys purchased in the past."
4,"INTERESTING, YET LACKING PHOTOGRAPHS","This book, presented in phonetic Ancient Egyptian and its English translation, covers select poetry from the First Dynasty down into Graeco-Roman times. The examples given include praises of the pharaohs, love lyrics and hymn to the gods. Included are very useful endnotes. The book is an interesting concept and the only criticism that can be made is that it has no illustrations of the texts mentioned. All in all, it is recommended for the interested in literature of Ancient Egypt."
5,A meticulous account by a man who was there,"This wonderful book lays out the thought process by which Dirac's formulation of quantum mechanics, with its much-handwaved-about ""bra"" and ""ket"" notation, came to be. Dirac makes minimal assumptions about the reader's prior education (appropriate, since the first edition was published in an age when a thorough scientific education comprised Homer, Virgil, Euclid, and Newton), so there are none of those annoying allusions of the form, ""from which, of course, the insights of [famous name X] allow us to conclude that ..."" In fact, there are extremely few footnotes of any kind, and they are not needed, as this work is neatly self-contained.Dirac is marvelously careful in calling attention to the guesses he makes along the way, so the careful reader can see what Dirac's premises are as well as what can be logically derived from them."
4,Good but HARD!!!!!,"A lot of stuff in the beginning is accessible and some of the later stuff is possibly accessible if you've had a great teacher who followed this book (and they won't because they find it excessively hard themselves) in their course work. Even Feynman said ""They had these great formulations in Dirac's book and in Heidler's. I couldn't quite read the books. They were too hard for me. "". So if you are lulled into complacency that understanding everything that's in the book is something that you'll carefully read page by page, you are kidding yourself. A lot of the stuff is simply ruminations on research that PAMD was doing then and some of it that wasn't. Anyway, its a QM book for the mathematically proficient. A QM book for researchers and mathematicians. For all else, there's Shankar and Griffiths. However, I'd pick up the book for Chapter 1 alone. Its concise and beautifully expressed."
3,Starting to rust and peel,I've owned this pan for about 3 years and use it once or twice a month. It performed well until recently. It is rusting from the inside out and the non stick finish is flaking off. I have never soaked it or used an abrasive pad to clean it. I expected it to last longer and I won't buy another one.
5,Nothing compares to these - wonderful,"These are superior result bake pans. Cookies come out baked evenly and never burn on the bottoms. I bought a few of these years ago and was looking to replace them as over time there is a little rusting - it's difficult to fully dry them after washing due to the insulation design - but it's a minor issue as they lasted many many years. Unfortunately, I could not find these anywhere in retail stores, so was very glad to be able to get them online at Amazon. I purchased some for myself and friends who enjoy baking to give as gifts - they are really that good. There is no comparison to these and other pans I have tried. Just wonderful."
5,Air cookie sheets are the best!,"Yes, the air insulated cookie sheets are more expensive than the cheaper kind, but I have never had anything turn out other than perfectly while using these. They are far more forgiving than regular cookie sheets and well worth the extra money."
5,good product,This is a replacement for my original pan. That one started to shed it's non stick covering. I love the size and ease of this pan. I am hoping that the finish stays on this one.I looked long and hard to find the replacement.
1,It rusts around the edge,"Mine rusts under the tiny rolled lip so that when it's wet, rusty water runs all over the place. Ick!"
2,Processongbproblem,"Probles with ""not"" processing my order. Called called called and emailed+ without answer. Finally snout 3 weeks later received. Some bumps do not stick"
4,These have been quite helpful...,"I ordered these for my mom who has macular degeneration. I liked the fact that there is a variety of sizes, shapes and colors. We've found numerous ways to use these throughout her home. I'd like to see more in the bright orange since that seems to be easier for her to see at this point. The clear ones worked for her in places she didn't have to SEE but could use touch and the black ones were ok IF there was enough light for her to see a good contrast of light and dark. I think it's a good sample of what's available and what works for each person. We continue to look for things to help her as her sight is getting worse. These have certainly helped her."
3,A One Time Read,"I recently ordered Davis' ""Do You Want to Be a Foster Parent"" after my first 6 months of foster parenting were behind me. I think part of its wide reception from reader's may just be due to the fact that there are very few quality books out there on foster parenting to begin with.Overall, I found a few interesting bits in the book, but I wouldn't recommend it as an ongoing reference book. This is one that I think readers may find value in reading, but would probably be better served to pick it up for a once over from their local library. Overall the flow was a bit disjointed at times and lacked cohesiveness. So far, though, this seems to be typical of many of books I've found on foster parenting. Better luck next time!"
2,Better suited as a soft hearted magazine article,"The title of this book does not describe the content. If you are looking for a guide to help you make the decision to foster parent or guide you through the process this is not it. This book is best suited as a soft hearted magazine article not a book. The information is first person stories mostly related only to the authors specific situation. The foster parenting info contained in this text is basically household tips, common sense parenting and recipes. The support information for associations is out of date and the only useful reference material fits on two pages. Finding good foster parent material is hard enough as it is, pass this one by."
1,Left hanging,"My wife gave me the trivia card game, the problem is the game doesn't include the answers. It's just a ploy to get you to buy the book. Save your money."
3,Misty Mundae,If you want to look at a cute naked young girl then this is for you! Not super hard core! If you are a Misty Mundae fan then you will probably like it. Quality is good and sound is good. Semi Soft-core!
3,Wasn't what I expected.,I read a lot of hype in various places about this book and I guess my expectations were too high. I have been in the computer field for 25 years. It is continually changing at an exponential rate. I thought the book would give some insight into keeping up with these changes. It did not for me. The primary focus seemed to be people brand new to this field and particularly students. I gave it 3 stars as it may truly benefit these people. Disappointing.
1,Do not buy this CD!,"When I was younger I purchased what I thought was a collection of TV theme songs. It turned out they were all done by the Ray Coniff orchestra and it sounded like elevator music. I have now started listening to latin rock and roll and just got burned the same way with this CD. These songs are NOT the original artists! I opened the CD, scanned though about half the songs before I gave up and tossed it in the garabage."
4,barry strikes great bond,"This is one of my favorite bond soundtracks. Almost all of them are by John Barry, who uses orchestration and occasionally minimalist instrumentation to convey the feel of the movie. I have listened to this album many times over, and enjoy it well each play."
1,Booring,This is one of the worst moves that I have ever seen. Talk about depressing and hitting the snooze button.
2,Boring Movie,I thought this movie was boring some times. There was drugs but no sex. I guess I expected more. Maybe a good movie for young kids to watch if they are thing of becoming a loser roadie.
4,Eldard is the man,"Very enjoyable movie. No spoilers, but let's just say certain cinematic formula's were not used here. Others were, but there were some surprises in the script. Ron Eldard is a great actor."
2,Not enough there for my A.D.D.,"I am thankful that I was able to see this movie on Amazon Prime because I would have really disliked wasting any money on this flick. Ho hum blah blah blah. Save it to watch after you've exhausted all other means of entertainment, or if you run out of sleep-aid.Also cross-check with IMDB.com I've found the reviews to sync up better from actual cinephiles."
3,Fun but troubling,The boys love this game. Only negative is that once it is loaded on the computer you have to leave the CD in to play the game so the boys are constantly fighting over who gets to play the game. Wish it could be played without the CD in place.
1,Cant find film for this!,"I bought this with the intention of using it and after I got it home I went online to search for film....Well come to find out, film is no longer made for this product! What a waste of money....."
4,What I wanted,My daughter loved it. Exactly what she was looking for. Now I just need to pay double the price of the camera for film.
3,Some of their better songs of the last 3 studio albums,I've been a Motorhead fan since 1978 and seen the band go through a lot of ups and downs. I haven't been particularly impressed with their more recent studio efforts but this CD captures some of the better songs. Still it's a slightly strange release after their great live opus of 'Everything Louder than.....'. Maybe someone at their record company fell asleep! Get the live album - it cranks!!
5,Still using to this day,"I got this phone some months back, and it came in perfect condition just like brand new, worked perfect, and gave us an extra phone we didn't have. Not to mention a corded phone that we could use when the power went out (Boy was I happy when I found that out!)The phone still works perfectly to this day and we have no plans of buying a new one until this one is old and gray. The price was amazing and I have no complaints what so ever!"
2,Not received,As of today 1/6/11 I still have not recieved my magazine. Please let me know how much longer it will be beforeI begin to receive it.
4,Strong Performance and song selection,Good intimate show that comes through on the Cd. Great song selection for an acoustic setting. Much of these i had not heard in the acoustic form. Good Cd any samples fan shoudl add to their collection.
4,Unique storyteller and musician,"Having lived in Denver for over fifteen years at one time and grew up along with ""The Samples"" music, I can honestly say that they're a great party band. But when Sean gets acoustic there's a magic that happens that's almost indescribable. His stories of the things in his life that are meaningful are things most of his listeners relate to from their own experience, too. I miss treking the mountains of Colorado and Seany Boy always takes me back to my days of serenity and yes, party. A very good CD."
2,Spend 50 bucks more and get a far better product,"I bought this product because it was cheapes, but then I saw another MiniDV camera from Canon (ZR60) which was only slightly costlier than this camera but had far more features and made this camera look completely inadequate.Following are the cons of this camera:1. No viewfinder. If you want to waste your battery, this camera ensures it by having no options besides LCD.2. No cover for LCD. Can be easily scratched etc.3. Big big cons for me: Not ergonomic, no good way to hold this camera. No strap on handle4. No AV-DV conversion. Bad if you want to record your TV or old VHS tapes onto MiniDV5. This was the problem I faced but ejector mechanism of this camera does not work reliably. Gave me lots of problem.Do yourself a favor, buy some Canon or Sony camcorder."
2,Cop Out.,"Yeah, the writer and director didn't want to step on any toes this long after the war.At least they could have told the real ending to the fire bombing of Dresden -- how many people were incinerated & cooked in the subways and air raid shelters. The script bypasses the number of deaths -- more than the atomic bomb casued in Hiroshima. The film shows the devastation to the buildings -- not the humans.Also, the story bypasses the fact that Dresden was not a military target -- Churchill did it to get even for the Germans accidentally bombing Coventry.These German film makers should be ashamed to downplay this atrocity."
2,LOL!,The American daylight raids and strafing of survivors weren't shown at all. It was made to look an entirely British affair. I actually laughed out loud when the RAF pilot showed up at the nurse's party in a German officer's uniform with that ridiculous 1980's haircut!
4,a pity they didn't choose better leads,"My true congratulations for director Richter's painstaking research on the fate of the German city of Dresden in 1945: his results are authentic and historically correct.Given this solid foundation, I feel sorry for Richter's unhappy choice of his male & female lead. John Light convinces as a RAF bomber-pilot, but not as a love-match for German female lead Felicitas Woll: one feels their characters do not match.As for Felicitas, one also wonders if she is in the right film. I think her talents are much better suited for light comedy or slapstick."
5,Dredsen,"I too first watch this film on the History Channel on 27 January 2008 and enjoyed it very much and I will be placing a pre-order for the movie right after I'm done here. Over the years I have read several books giving first hand accounts on the bombing of Dresden and coming across this movie last night while channel surfing was a real treat for me. Though in this story, the first 2 hrs sets up the romantic relationship of the main characters and the bombing of the city takes place in the last hour of the film. I must say that the director did a very fine job depicting many but not all of the horrors of the fire storm from that fateful night.I'm looking forward to adding this movie to my collection and give it high marks."
3,Recommend with hesitation,Learning what the devastation was like was real but the love life of the main characters needs modifying seemed just thrown in and exploited to sell the show and it didn't need that. Too bad
1,Extremely dissapointed,"The plot of the movie is absolutely trivial - most of it deals with the romance between a pilot of one of the bombers that was shot-down and a german nurse. But almost silent about the atrocity of the bombing, the great suffering of the civilian population and the terrible loss to the world of one of the jewels of Europe. Not worth the price."
5,a look back,enjoyed this movie had a chance to see what my wife went through as she was in Dresden during this raid and got out with out a scratch. Thanks Bigjack
3,dresden,"dvd dresden. good story. More could have beensaid of the restoration of the fruenkirche at theend of the story, as well as devastation of thecity caused by bombardment."
2,Try to find a similar unit from another manufacturer.,"I purchased one of these because it accomodated a space problem in an ill-designed kitchen, and while it fit the room well and accomodated more sensibly the amount of food storage genuinely necessary to a ""modern"" lifestyle, its temperature gauge is located in such a way that it's easily rotated when items are put in or removed from the unit-the result being that I've now had to throw away four batches of completely FROZEN food, three of them the morning following spending a lot of money at the grocery store. PLUS, it measures temperature from ""1 to 5,"" and I have to keep looking in the ""owner's manual"" to remember which one is warmer and which is colder whenever I'm resetting the unit after throwing out my now-frozen dinners."
2,Incomplete for use,"Be advised when purchasing this product: the headset cord does not end in a telephone headset plug. Instead, it ends in a ""quick disconnect"" plug. Unless you already have the other half of the ""quick disconnect"" plug (from an amplifier or another headset), you must separately purchase a cord to plug this headset into your phone. I've spoken with plantronics' support, and they confirmed that this product is not intended to ship with the cord to plug into the phone (despite that the user guide included with the headset specifies that it can be plugged directly into a phone's headset jack)."
3,its on netflix,"its in french but has subtitles, it is a fairy tale mix of sleeping beauty and the snow queen its got some adult nudity. ending was not so great."
2,I'm sorry to say I'm not impressed.,"I don't think I'm the pickiest person on Earth, but I find this set wanting. The navigation from one game collection to another seems more difficult than it needs to be, plus there's no single listing of everything in all the sets. The game descriptions aren't, in my opinion, very descriptive. Furthermore, one of the game sets locked up my computer even though I didn't open a single game. I think I'm allowing an extra star just for the sheer number of games available. LOL"
4,Great pictures and overall descriptions; lots of numeric errors,"This book is fun to read, and a lot can be learned from it, but beware of the numeric errors: do not trust dates, sizes, distances. Common errors include: billion sometimes means 10^9 and sometimes 10^12, distances to galaxies are completely wrong (e.g. 10 light years to M82), use of thousand instead of thousandths, and multiple others."
3,"Great Observatories, So-so Photos","Obviously no book that is only 240 pages long, and mostly photographs at that, can include all of the important observatories of the world. It is inevitable that some favorites will be omitted. But it is disappointing that more care was not taken with the photographs -- after all, this really is mostly a coffee-table picture book. Many of the photos are soft, and moreover suffer from shallow depth-of-field... critical parts of the photo are not even in focus."
3,"Good book, but...","This book had the potential to be great. And its a great book for the observatories that are covered. But the omission of some of the really GREAT observatories was a bit of a disappointment to me. There is about 3/4 of a page on Palomar. And even that is somewhat inaccurate.If you're looking for Palomar info, get ""Perfect Machine"" by Florence. A great read..."
2,"Better titled ""Some Observatories of the World""","OK, it's a good-looking book with lots of great shots of interesting research observatories around the world. My great disappointment is the near-complete absence any mention of the Palomar Telescope, except for a brief mention in the introduction. Or Kitt Peak for that matter. Or any number of architecturally important observatories. I can't explain how they chose the contents of their book, or why they devoted an entire section of the book to telescopes that haven't even been built yet."
5,A Must Read for ANY Woman!,"Prior to reading this book, I honestly thought I was going crazy! I went to 8 different physicians seeking help, and none of them had any reasonable solutions to offer. I was told that my symptoms (lack of energy, weight gain, depressed moods and difficulty concentrating) were normal for someone my age with children. Half of the physicians tried to put me on anti-depressants. When I did attempt to take them, they did not make my life better, they only made me feel ""numb"". After reading this book, I finally have hope and no longer feel like a hypochondriac! Hotze's natural approach to health makes so much sense and seems so simple! This book is very easy to understand and an enjoyable read! I've even bought multiple copies already for Mother's Day presents!"
1,"Hormones, Health and Happiness","I am not happy with the service I received from Amazon.com as I have not received this book! I paid for it, but did NOT get it."
3,"OK book, others are better","This book is really just an introduction to bio-identical hormones, but I feel there are other books where your money is better spent, like Uzzi Reiss's book, Natural Hormone Balance, which I feel is the best of the bunch. After having read Dr. Reiss's book, I realized I didn't need to read any of the others."
3,Roman Helmet Review,"We used this product for an Easter presentation at church. The helmet is quite flimsy, but it worked for two presentations and survived to be used again next year."
3,Thin Plastic,"It looks good from about 20 feet away, and is usable for plays etc., but it is a little bit flimsy for the cost. A Roman soldier would have been beat up for wearing one."
4,Great little pocket guide,"As a companion to Watercolour Flower Painter's Pocket Palette I find this to be a terrific little book. The colour coding, selection of flowers and leaves is most helpful. As in the Pocket Palette--and being a new watercolourist--I would like to have seen more step-by-step guides but I realize it is a pocket guide!"
5,Good quality puzzle,Bought this for my brother in law who is a collector of minature American Fire trucks. Stuck for a christmas present and found this. I was over the moon with it and know he will be. Cant get anything like this in the UK.
1,love alive reunion,I ask for a cd and got a casset and had to give it to someone order was messed up.
5,POWERFUL!!!,"Okay, I bought this only to listen to the 2nd CD. The fresh arrangements on these classics blessed my life as though I was listening to them for the very first time. If you love gospel music, this MUST be in your library!!"
1,Aaron Henry--a morally bankrupt man,"I came to know Aaron Henry when he was elected to serve in the Mississippi House in 1980. Initially I thought he was a doddering relic, yet pleasant enough, who tended to pontificate. He was in over his head and didn't really seem to have much interest in the legislative process and, as a result, was not highly regarded by his peers. He had a long history of arrests in city parks in the middle of the night, if you catch my drift. He made advances toward me and several other individuals--it was pathetic. Aaron Henry is indicative of the rotten core of the civil rights movement and liberal politicians in general--you don't have to look far for this. He ranks up there with Al Lowenstein and Bill Clinton. I believe this book is self serving and out of synch with reality."
5,So far So Good,Bought this leaf canister to capture big leaves in my pool. It have been in water for several months and working good for big leaves. Just cross my fingers to see how long it will last; I like this product. So far So Good.
3,unimpressed,"Received leaf catcher and tried to use. Needs different attachment at each end, which was inconvenient, to say the least. Worked OK at keeping the big stuff out, but still let a lot of small leaf pieces through to the filter."
5,Great!,"I love this leaf catcher. We have so many trees behind our property and the leaves all end up in our pool. Before when I vacuumed the leaves would have to go all through the pipes before getting caught in the filter basket and I would have to shut off the pump to empty it. Now I can leave the pump running and just remove the leaf cannister from the vacuum tube, dump the leaves then reattach it and continue vacuuming."
5,Pool Vac,Item works as planned and I saved about $20 over the price at the local pool stores.The item was shipped promptly.
5,Very good!,I bought this unit to go along with my Hayward 925ADV Navigator Pro Automatic Suction Pool Cleaner and they really go well together. Nice design and work well together. Excellent delivery. No problem so far.
2,"Won't connect, difficult to open","The intake end (tan in picture) won't connect to any of the 1-1/2"" hoses I tried. The hose ends won't fit inside and won't stretch over. It wouldn't connect to a couple of 1-1/4"" hoses I had either. I've seen some pictures of it with long-end 1-1/4"" hoses inserted inside and I'm going to track down one of those hoses to try. Second gripe is that it is difficult to open to get debris out, then the O-ring requires lubing every time to get at least some life out of it."
5,What a price!,This product was $20 cheper than my local pool supply store and it was shipped for free. You just can't beat that. It fit my current vacum hose and works just fine. Now if I could only get the vacum to work!
2,doesn't work - nice idea,hard to open and dumps leaves back into pool. thought it would help keep leaves out of filter but when attached to hose it caused pool sweep to malfunction
5,AWESOME PRODUCT!!!!! SAVE YOUR PUMP!!!,"I purchased this product to accompany our automatic pool cleaner (Also Hayward) because our pump filter would clog within minutes after sucking up pine needles/leaves/debris from the bottom of the pool. This thing is worth its weight in GOLD! Easy to set up, easy to clean, and easy to see when it needs to be cleaned. This even did a great job of stopping small particulates (little pieces of grass, and debris tracked into the pool via feet). It is definitely a MUST HAVE for anyone looking to save themselves some time, effort and energy when vacuuming or running ANY auto pool cleaner!!!!!"
3,Correction,"I heartily concur that coaches and other helping professionals need to be able to work on their clients whole lives..sex certainly being a part of that. I'm always astonished when coach says ""oh that's not something I ever discuss with clients."" My experience is that it comes up at least 30% of the time in some Context.I did want to make an important correction though. Tolerations and the style of coaching attributed to Cheryl, were actually part of the coaching curriculum designed by Thomas Leonard, founder of Coach U and still taught there today. Cheryl was one of Thomas's early students."
5,Great bible for our tween!,Our daughter loves reading this bible that offers many explanations for some difficult concepts/stories in the bible. We love that she has moved on from her mostly picture bibles.
3,The KJV Kids' Study Bible,"I purchased the Bible for my Great Grandson who is 8 years old. Unfortunately I should have paid more attention to the contents of the book. I primarily went from the reviews listed. When I saw the cover I assumed there would be illustrations inside the Bible -however was disappointed that there where none. I feel children of this age pay more attention and interest in the subject when it is illustrated. The cover of the Bible was so nicely detailed and inviting - that I was sure there would be further illustrations inside. The other content seemed fine, and I am sure will be understood and interesting to the child."
5,KJV Kids' Study Bible,"Ordered several of these for the Sunday School kids at my church. The kids fell in love with these! This Bible goes beyond just the word, it gives pictures and explanations, has a wonderful dictionary, sections to help the children reflect on their current life and how to apply God's word to it. The illustrations are fabulous! The hard cover makes it sturdy. Definately a winner!!! You won't be disapointed!"
4,Needs just a bit more,"I really liked all the extra features (such as Book introductions, Words to Remember, Life in Bible Times, Did you Know as well as concordance, charts & maps) just like they were shown looking thru the book's pages on your site. The only things I expected that weren't in there were Jesus' words in red and cross references at the end of some verses indicating other verses or passages having similar meaning or further bearing on the word or phrase in the verse presently being read. Those were probably oversights on my part.The book itself was in great condition. Well worth the price paid."
3,Neat book,Gives a pretty decent explanation of Huna. Worth a read. Beware of the new-age fluff that sneaks in here and there.
1,HUNA IS NOT HAWAIIAN,"I am still shocked and amazed at how many people buy into Huna, Huna never has been an ""ancient"" hawaiian art form. Its founder isnt even Kanaka Maoli."
5,Great Album,"It's not very often you can find music this good. I find all the tracks very emotional, but ""does me no good"" has to be my favorite."
4,webkinz,"My 8 and 11 year old goddaughters love them. Some education - sometimes they have me do the science questions rapidly for them! This leads to a discussion of what is and isn't cheating, so that's good."
4,Firefox in reverse...,This time Mitchel Gant flies an antiquated Mil-24 deep INTO Russia for an extraction. Firefox fans should like this if only to read more of Gant's exploits. It is slightly outdated but should still prove entertaining.
4,Great for fans; not a good Buechner intro,"Fans of Frederick Buechner's work will want to read this novel for the depth of understanding he provides regarding his relationships with his family and his appreciation of the family history, but persons who have not read his other memoirs (especially Sacred Journey, but also Now and Then, Telling Secrets, and the Longing for Home) will want to start with them to get a better introduction to Buechner's life. It is, though, a great resource for understanding the inspirations in his life, and his trademark style shines well."
2,Not his best work,"As a fan of Frederick Buechner, I found this volume in our church library and secured it anticipating a summer weekend of ecstasy, reading this book on the back porch while sipping lemonade. I found it disappointing, as he focuses on his collection of Buechner family memoribilia. As hard as he tries to universalize it, making it accessible to all of us, for me, it just didn't work. And it reads like a review of one's summer family reunion. Sorry. Read his other stuff. It's great!"
5,instant classic,"messy marv gets better and better wit time. this album is up there with disobayish. u got rich the factor, lil flip, dead prez on here the beats are sic overall a sic ass album"
3,Intrigue in Missouri,"Porter spins a good yarn tackling themes such as cutting your teeth in midwestern journalism, following in the rather impressive footsteps of his father and a complex love triangle. The characters are vivid, unique and I enjoyed losing myself in the descriptions of the book. Yet overall, the depth of the characters did not overcome the blandness of the story - I did not find the plot gripping and felt that it plodded along. If I had to guess, this story seems a bit autobiographical. But I would recommend this as a good read to those who embrace Richard Ford or Elizabeth Stroudt"
4,cute book with a twist,"This book came out so recently that I came on here to write a review thinking I would be the first. But alas I've been beat to to the punch.I love books and I am always happy to see a new author come on the scene. I picked this one by its cover. Haha yeah I know you shouldn't judge a book by its cover. But it turned out to be a good call. You have to like the main character's ambition and humor. I did. And the book is not so cut and dry as you would think. So when you think you know what is going on, you don't. I like that. The only thing I thought this book lacked was personal or spiritual growth from the main character. Not that all good books need that -- I just prefer it in books I read.This one took me about a weekend to read and I think it was well worth the time. A deeply moving book that will make you cry, laugh and sing? No. But if you have some free time and would like an easy read, this book is very enjoyable."
2,Not well-developed,This book seems like an outline for a novel. None of the characters are really developed enough to make them interesting. It just struck me as a young writer's effort.
3,An Interesting First Book,"A good first book; I am interested in reading this author's next, to see how his skill develops. He has set this work firmly in St. Louis and Columbia MO, but he is obviously not a resident or native. Most interesting to me, though not very subtly handled, are the deceptions between most of the characters; deception seems to be the book's central theme. Unfortunately, the truthful characters are not as developed as they could have been. Does Thea represent a choice for maturity and health, as opposed to Alicia? One does not know because Gordon does not seem to make a real choice. His hand is forced, and circumstance bails him out.Overall this is an intriguing Sunday afternoon read."
4,Enjoyed it but have one complaint..,"I enjoyed the book very much, but I have one complaint. I mainly bought the book because of a picture of an Irish Wolfhound on the cover. There is a subplot about Irish Wolfhounds and the dog show world. However, the author shows his lack of knowledge of the sport of purebred dogs. For example, he repeatedly refers to a dog winning the Hound ""division"" at Westminster. People involved with dogshows will know it is called the Hound ""group"". Non-dog people wont notice, but dog people will cringe at this and several other errors.The plot, however, was very enjoyable."
4,"Excellent disk, but you have to see him live!!!","The first time I saw Venice Shoreline Chris was in Vancouver a few years back where he opened a show for The Planet Smashers (another great band). Since then I have seen him in Montreal a few times and his sets never cease to touch me. His sweet romantic numbers with just acoustic guitar are simply magical. His covers of great SKA tunes from the past are also always a lot of fun. The actual album also includes some organ tracks I'm not so fond of but the strength of the other tracks more than compensates. I eagerly await some new material, hopefully accompanied by covers of old SKA standards... the way he does 'em live."
5,Comments on the My Little Pony Game,What an awesome game!! My girls loved it and it was in such good shape (since I bought it used)! We've had some fun times playing this one!!!!!
5,Great game,Great game! My daughter and I played this over and over when she was 4 and 5. Easy enough to learn but not babyish. It is a perfect first board game.
1,Be careful....,"My 25 month old son has been using this potty for the past month, after cleaning it today - he picked up the blue seat and put it on his head - ""Look, mommy, hat"" I chuckled, and in the next second he pull it completely over his head. His next phrase was ""Mommy stuck"" and the screams began. Ok, now, I know I am a good mother but I laughed because this was ridiculous. 45 minutes later it became scary that an emergency room visit was in my future. This thing was not coming off his skull. It took my husband and I a half hour to literally saw this seat off from around his neck. I hope this review is helpful and this does not happen to you."
1,Uncomfortable Potty,"I looked through all the reviews from many of the potties available and chose this one, now I regret it. I can tell it is uncomfortable for our daughter. She keeps adjusting herself and tries to find a comfortable way to sit and go to the bathroom but she can't. We have another seat that fits onto your regular toliet that is really cushy. She just loves that one and is very comfortable by the padding there and can sit for up to 25-30 minutes while I read her books, but she can't even sit for a 30 seconds on the little potty. She also has red marks on her behind from the seat. Great price but uncomfy!"
3,Too hard on little bottoms,We have two potty chairs for our 17 month old daughter. She refuses to sit on this one and I have noticed that when she gets up there are red marks on her bottom. I think that this one is too hard compared to the other one that she has. Not very comfortable.
2,Unsturdy,"I like the fact that my son can use the seat as a toilet, and then my nephew when he comes over can use the stepstool to reach the big toilet. It's just not very sturdy. My son has tipped over more than a few times when getting up to ""check his progress"" and the lid doesn't fit well on the big toilet. I'm checking into a new safer seat right now."
1,Learned my lesson,"I bought this one because it was small & simple (no talking, music, bells & whistles, etc). I liked the 3-in-1 features. But now I see two major downfalls: 1) As others have commented, it may be too small for some kids. The bowl does not have a large opening, so in many cases you child may not get lined up just right (especially boys). 2) This is the reason that finally made me get a new one-- I really don't like how you have to take it apart and use it upside down as a step stool. My son ""throws"" it apart about 10 times a day to use it to get to the sink.I just bought one that has a lid that functions as the step stool instead, and it's working out much better."
1,Very poor quality!,Very small for average toddlers and within 5 minutes of use the potty's bowl broke. Get another one!!.
2,Not the equal of On My Knees,"Tammy Faye Starlite's On My Knees is a terrific send up of Christian values, well sung, emotive, and evocative. By contrast, Used Country Female is mostly way overproduced and for most of the disk it sounds like TFS is just singing to honor her contractual obligations. A bunch of recycled ideas. However, the genuine product shines through on the last three songs (especially The Jim Rob Song and to some extent on Don't you Hear Jerusalem Moan and The South's Gonna Rise Again). The rest of the disk, as mentioned, pales to the brilliance I heard on On My Knees."
1,Needs An Amp!,"I'm still shopping for a similar-looking set, but one that terminates with a 2.5mm plug, compatible with cordless phones. When this unit, used, arrived it had a cord ending with the ""quick-disconnect"" line connector. Working with the seller, I acquired the other half of the cord. But It Terminated In a Square, Four-lead Connector, Probably Physically Compatible With Normal Household Phone Wall Jack!After some web digging at Plantronics>Encore>second page>fine print, I discovered that it requires one of their amps. More homework revealed dissatisfied reviews with their companion amp, priced from about $60 used to $200 new.Next logical step will be to work on returns procedure."
2,Poor design to fit neck,"I ordered this and, while I'm a fan of other Therabeads products, I found this poorly designed. Unless you have a very thick neck, the velcro straps are worse than useless. They either get in the way or cling to the fabric cover. The only way I could get it to fit was to cross the straps in front below the neck -- and then it didn't cover the neck well."
3,Therabeads neck pack,"I've had a number of these Therabeads neck packs over the years and bought this one because it looked exactly like the ones I have purchased at my local medical supply store but this one was cheaper. This one is too stiff, is thinner and does not lie along my neck like it should. It also does not heat as well as the ones I have had previously. I'll be buying local from now on."
5,Wonderful !!!!,"I just bought my second neck wrap with the moist beads. I've had my other one for several years after a 2 whiplashes. I use it all the time. Its very similar to the ones they use at Physical Therapy. It doesn't have to be right next to your neck. The ones at PT aren't.If you use heat without moisture it takes the moisture out of your muscles then your pain is worse. These beads are wonderful; you know they are working because your skin is moist when you take the wrap off. Sometimes in the winter, I just heat it up as a mini spa treatment.I can't believe some of the reviews on this are not good. The velcro works just fine if you need to walk around but if you dont want to use it, you can flip it around and not use it.Sometimes I get a regular scarf and wrap that around it to hold it instead of the velcro-it holds the heat longer that way too.Thanks for reading and God Bless"
3,"It works, but....","I am disappointed in this product. It is too long, and does not wrap up close around the neck. The velcro straps snag on the white fabric of the wrap. The cover is not microwavable, so you have to remove it and then slide the wrap back inside the cover, keeping the velcro tabs from snagging on the fabric or the cover. If it was shorter in length I could ignore the other minor problems. The pack does provide moist heat that feels great."
2,Neck pain relief,"I have used other microwave neck heaters before. Though I like the shape, it doesn't retain the heat as long as others."
2,dissapointed,not as expected doesnt hold heat for more than a few minutes.by the time it was heated and returned to sit most of heat had gone
2,Disappointed.,"I saw about 3 episodes and it had great promise, than it took a cheap shot at Christian belief and in the trash it went."
5,DVD watcher,"A friend of mine told me about this series & said she really enjoyed it. When Amazon offered the whole series for slightly more than the cost of one season, I took a chance and bought the whole series. My friend was right, this is a very enjoyable series. I was rather sorry they got rid of some of the characters and brought in new ones, but I guess they were just trying to keep it fresh. Wish there had been more shows. All in all, lots of fun, light drama."
4,I'm a fan,I also love to cook. It's a nice and fluffy little show for an anglophile such as myself so the detetctive story part set in jolly old england makes a warm little series for me... able to see richard griffiths display more than he is usually given to do...
4,A wonderful British series,I happened upon this series on a PBS station and fell in love with it. A rather rotund character and a strong cast make it a joy. And it combines two of my favorite subjects -- food and detecting.
5,Pie in the Sky Complete Collection,Absolutely everything I expected and more! All the wit and plot intricacies I look for in a fine British work. Characterizations andnuances make for a truly enjoyable experience.
5,Great Series,Pie in the Sky was a great series hated to see it end. The chef/police officer twist was interesting and seemed to hold it all together
5,Great series,"Didn't know what to expect when I ordered ""Pie in the Sky"" Characters were interesting and funny. Just the right amount of cooking and detective action in each episode. Did not want it to end...."
4,Great auditioning book-for females,"This book has great music and wonderful lyrics, but it lacks in male solos. Some my veiw is: if you're using this book for a tryout, don't buy it unless your a female."
5,Great Experience,The product was exactly how it was decribed.Fast delivery and always a great experience using Amazon.com!
1,Tony Bennett?,I do not think thjis album contains any Tony Bennett material - can somebody confirm and if so remove this album from his listing please
1,A Desecration: Ignatius Rising,"This pseudo-biography is filled with misinformation, with misquotes (for example, attributing a Poe poem to the wrong story) and to the wildest kind of speculation. It is a scary book, because people who know no better will assume that what these two women write it true--and a good 50 percent of it is either false or based on the wildest speculation."
1,Save your money...buy this one USED,"This is very badly written and appears to be put together by illiterates.But don't let me stop there, it is not only the presentation that is wanting it is the information. These girls must have learned to write by doing service for the likes of Inquirer or Star...or worse.If you must have this bit of yellow in your collection get it used and don't contribute to their delinquency.What Trash!!!!!"
3,Informative in a Text Book Kind of Style,"After reading ""A Confederacy of Dunces,"" I was anxious to learn as much as I could about Ken Toole. As a result, I ordered ""Ignatius Rising"" and began reading it as soon as it arrived.This book taught me things I did not know about Ken Toole, but was not a fun read. It read more like a text book. The facts were there, they just weren't all that interesting. (A little surprising since the events and people in Ken Toole's life seem to have been quite interesting.)I respect the authors for not using creative license in their storytelling, but it made the book fairly boring.What I enjoyed the most were the letters written by Toole and Gottleib themselves. These letters provided more insight into the Pultizer Prize winning author than the entire rest of the book."
4,"""John Kennedy Toole, child prodigy, son, novelist ....""","Intriguing, compelling and so very interesting! Ignatius Rising is a wonderful story about the life of a someone who you could not help but feel sorry for. If only he knew the great things that would become if he would have just pushed himself a little harder. His mother (and I use that term loosely) was a very driven woman who drove her son to his demise. Having grown up in New Orleans, it was wonderful to read of so many familiar surroundings. New Orleans is full of history and John Kennedy Toole is one of the figures in New Orleans history who should be immortalized for a long time. Kudos to Rene' Nevils and Deborah Hardy - you did a great job!!"
4,Learn the twisted story behind Toole's life and death,"Any fan of Confederacy of Dunces should naturally have an interest learning about the author, John Kennedy Toole. Misunderstood and over-protected throughout most of his life, Toole struggled with not only his writing, but as the authors would lead you to believe, also his sexuality. After reading this, one will notice many similarities and parallels between John Kennedy Toole and his famous character, Ignatius Reilly, from their social awkwardness to their dependence on their mothers."
2,Good Research BUT...,A boring life makes for a tedious bio. And the lack of an index is inexcusable.
1,Stacking the deck?,"Notice the 5-star reviews are clustered around June 2001, when the hardcover came out, and April 2005, when the paperback came out--could it be the authors got their friends and sources to put in a good word?-- because these reviews focus not on the merits of Ignatius Rising as a literary effort, but on their interest in Dunces itself, and are superficial in whatever analysis they provide. They happen to be predominantly from NY or Louisiana. Meanwhile, the most detailed reviews concerning the book itself express disappointment with the quality of scholarship and writing."
1,TABLOID GOSSIP POSING AS ACADEMIC WRITING,"This book is shockingly bad. If you are a fan of Toole's work and life, this is not the place to get your info. The majority of the work is neither footnoted nor substantiated in any way. There are a tremendous amount of assumptions, speculations, and what appear to be outright fabrications, that would paint Toole to fit their convenient image. Sadly, there is still a void where a true biography should be and this will only confuse things until then. I would greatly recommend Ken & Thelma, or take a trip to New Orleans and study his letters personally."
1,An Uwarranted Diatribe Against Capitalism,"My Eighth-Grader checked out this book as a part of his research on the rise of America as an industrial power. After he became concerned that this resource seemed to conflict with most of his other sources, his mother and I began to scan through the Meltzer biography. We didn't find an unbiased review of Carnagie's life building the foundations of America's infrastructure and steel industry. We didn't find praise for his significant philanthropic support for libraries, learning and art. We found an unremittingly negative slant on virtually all aspects of Carnagie's life which sounded less like biography and more like socialist rant. Meltzer certainly has a message in this book- all capitalism is a self-serving, arrogant and socially destructive force. Meltzer is free to advance his revisionist diatribe for any mature readership- but not to my eighth-grade child.I do not recommend this book to anyone as anything but propaganda."
5,GREAT PRODUCT,I had a miss fire code indicating that one of my engine cylinders was out. I used this product on the spark plug wire. It showed that there was not power on the wire. I check the other wires and they showed they had power. The problem was a bad coil. This product saved me allot of work. I am going to buy an extra one.
2,VERY DISAPPOINTED!,"I recently purchased this book along with several others by different authors. This book has a number of good qualities such as one fly pattern per page, large print( for us older fishers), and a good description of the fly and the process. However , all of this is overshadowed by the absence of colour photos of the flies. This could have been accomplished by including a colour photo on each page or at the very least several pages of colour photos for reference. Since appearance and colour play such an important role in fly patterns it is difficult to understand why the colour photos were overlooked. I would not recommend this book, the publisher has done a disservice to the author."
3,Old Book,I think I had this book i high school or first year college and I wanted to review some basic rules which I will be able to do if I ever get around to it. It arrived in just o.k. shape but the same can be said about me.
1,Lifeguard Does Not Work as Claimed,"Lifeguard failed to back up my data in an orderly fashion. It could not collectively backup all data to a separate hard drive on my computer. I have been unable to recover Outlook Express files which were backed up using Lifeguard prior to a C:/drive reformatting (necessary because of a virus problem). I have been engaged in an e-mail dialogue with the company's technical support team for almost a year. Assurances that patches would be sent to fix the problems have failed to materialise. On two occasions problems were referred to a research team with no solutions forthcoming.Technical support for Lifeguard is very poor, is all conducted by e-mail and repeats advice ad nauseum even if same previous advice has not solved problem.A very inferior product with very poor support. My rating of ""one star"" is given because there is no provision for awarding ""no stars."""
3,Lightweight Inspirational Reading,"""The Dirt from Tripp Street"" is a collection of more than 50 short essays by Rabbi Daniel Wolk. Each essay is three or four pages and reads like a sermon: an everyday episode from Wolk's life is related and then brought into sharper philosophical focus, usually with a moral at the end. Wolk's writing is folksy and often humorous, but both the events and the philosophical views were too pedestrian for my taste. Some essays are quite good, while some are quite odd. The good news is that they are all short, and the book is a quick read."
5,Easy to install!,"Excellent quality, and very easy to install! I received the product within the time frame they promised, and after reading the installation instructions, had it securely on my truck in less than 10 minutes. I live in upstate NY where the winters can be brutal, and this past fall the rainfall has been above normal. This cover has so far stood up to all of it with no sign of wear, and no snow or water in the bed. Chances are I will replace my truck before this cover wears out, but I would not hesitate to buy another Lund."
5,Soft and Sweet,The hymns on the album are mostly soft and sweet. He brings out a lot of love and emotion.Each note is crisp and clear with no finger noise on the strings.
5,The Best Hymnal Music I've Heard,I would have to rate this CD as the best of Chet's music. I alsopurchased the book with the music and tab's. The songs that heselected were songs that inspire me. I would highly recommend theCD and book both. Unless you're playing you wouldn't need the bookthough.
5,Excellent resource - highly recommended!,"Net Crimes & Misdemeanors is truly one of those rare books that is written intelligently, yet not too over one's head. I consider myself an expert in computers and Internet security and found this book taught me some things I hadn't even thought of. Sometimes online users tend to forget the basics of staying safe and I was guilty of some of them.Kudos to Hitchcock and I look forward to reading more books by this author."
5,The best Internet safety book ever!,"I bought this book after the author helped me with my cyberstalking case. Not only did she help me get my cyberstalker kicked off his ISP, she ""held my hand"" through the whole process.This book is truly an ideal book for EVERY Internet user, no matter how old you are. There is everything from cyberstalking to online auctions, shopping, spam, viruses and much more. The tips and resources are wonderful and the accompanying web site at www.netcrimes.net is a must to bookmark and visit frequently.Buy this book today - and buy copies of it for your friends and family, too!"
2,Disappointed,"I have two other albums by this artist, and I like them both. However, this album is just not up to par with the others, in my opinion."
3,Enveloping elusiveness,"3 1/2Most of these atmospheric post-rock b-listers exploit rather than innovate in a field where near everything seems derived from the top. This guy clearly borrow from the playbook as well, indulging in stoney, drony sonic experimentations past casual threshold, but is bold and inventive enough to carve out something that matters quite a bit, even if stylistic trail-off erodes the overall outcome."
3,Title more fun than game?,I was hoping there would be more games on the cd-rom than there actually are.....
4,Don't Legalize - Re-Legalize,"The book is great, and presents many facts supporting the re-legalization of marijuana - Which is exactly what we need. We don't need it Legalized, we need it Relegalized. For thousands of year, Marijuana was entirely legal, it's only in recent times that marijuana became outlawed. Remember, not Legalized, Re-Legalized(Quick note - No, i'm not 1. I don't feel like registering)"
5,Legalize it now,I used this book as one of my sources for a college paper i wrote. My grade was a B+. I think my professor smoked. I should have smoked with him.
5,Decent Workout,This is a great DVD to workout too if you are a beginner. It is well paced and the routines are easy to follow. The instructors are good without being too cheesy. If you have a hard time fitting in a workout routine this is a good buy. If you are intermediate level and want a challenging workout this is not the DVD for you. I am intermediate level and use this DVD if I want a quick workout or just want to concentrate on toning my muscles.
2,Small in size.,Purchased 8 tomato plants in late May early June. Plants arrived somewhat healthy(leaves looked pale green yellowish) However only a week or 2 after planting they all died. They were a lot smaller than expected. It was a bit late in the season that I purchased these so maybe next year I will put my order in a bit sooner and see what kind of plants I get...For $8 per 4 pk not a bad deal but Im alil disappointed the plants didnt survive.
1,Plants didnt make it,The plants looked healthy upon arrival- planted them in my topsy turvy plnater and they were dead the next morning. $5.bux down the drain
4,Fun game for kids!!,"My son and I bought this game and played it three times the first day. I hesitated to buy it at first because I thought it would be a silly game, but it was fun for both of us to play together. He and his friends have played together as well and really enjoyed it. The game does not drag on too long keeping the kids attention. It is a good purchase."
5,Not just for metal,"I got this pedal free with an amp I bought on ebay. I expected it to give out of control, ridiculous amounts of distortion. I was pleasantly surprised to discover that you can roll back the distortion and get some dirt and still keep a descent tone. There are 3 distortions - Metal, Pulverize and Insane. Believe it or not the Insane distortion (IMHO) is the most useful. With the insane setting, I am able to play loud and soft and the pedal responds similarly to a tube amp.Also, If you like huge amounts of distortion, this pedal will deliver as well - that's just not what I'm into. I guess most people looking at this review want to play metal. If you find yourself owning this pedal and DON'T play metal, you will still find it useful."
3,Sounds great but eats batteries.. even when turned off.,"I was impressed with the sound of the pedal, but noticed quickly that every time I used it I had to put in a fresh battery. I thought maybe it had been turned on accidentally or something, so I made sure to turn it off and put it where it would not be disturbed, yet still left it plugged in to the guitar and amp (the amp was off). I came back the next day to find it dead. I don't get how it could drain the battery while turned off, but I like the sound, so I am here on Amazon buying an adapter cord. I just wanted to see if anyone else was having the same problem, and also to let people know what to expect if it is a common issue."
3,OK--but not the best,"If you are looking for some floral tips and arrangement ideas, this book will help you with those ideas. However, if you are looking for an instructional book on how to make arrangements yourself, this book doesn't give enough information on this. (Yes, there is a small section in the book about making them yourself--but does not tell you how to make certain ones shown in the book). I would like a more informational--how-to-make boquet book. I might just have to write one myself!"
3,Not enough information included,"I was hoping this book, since it focuses on flowers, would have pictures and small descriptions of most of the flowers a couple might choose for their wedding. However, this book is very limited in that regard. It's as if they settled on the top-seller flowers, put in a photo and description of those, and then threw the rest out. Because of that, this book was not very helpful to me. I went to see the florist a lot less informed then I thought I was, and ended up choosing several flowers that I didn't even know about because they're not in this book.The pictures are pretty, but way too much was left out for this book to be functional."
4,"Great to create inspiration, gives names/photos and meanings..","I recently got engaged and wanted to take a look at flower possibilities for my future wedding. This book is great because it has photos of many different types of flowers, what season they are available in, if they have any aroma, color choices, etc. They even have a section that goes over all the different areas you'll need floral arrangements. And a section at the back for DIY-ers. I really like this book and will be using it as a reference to create my dream wedding flowers. The Knot makes great books."
2,Ok,"This book was in good condition but the pictures were dated and in black in white, which I thought was weird since it is a book on flowers. Overall it was an ok purchase only becuase of the price I paid for it."
3,elegant but not inspiring,"This is a book about bouquets, not wedding flowers overall. The title is misleading. The picutres are very simple and well laid out however, I did not find that there were many original ideas in this book. They bouquets were super simple and clean. I like a little more flair than what was presented in this book. If you like that very plain look, than this is for you."
1,Not practical for flowershop owners,"If you own a flowershop and want something to get fresh ideas from, this is not the book. It shows nice pictures of many different flowers, unfortunately some of them not commonly found at flowershops. Nothing practical for your clients to get ideas for their wedding. Disappointing."
2,Not too exciting,I didn't find this book very exciting. I looked through it and there's really nothing in it that I can use. I was looking for ideas for my wedding bouquet and I really got NONE.
2,academic to the nth,I was interested in a modern short history of the laws of Wales before Edward I. This volume is for the scholar who wants to get a masters/doctorate in that area. A few interesting parts and concepts [particularly that the grandfather's estate went to his children but on the death of the last child was re-assembled (!!) and divided equally among his grandchildren] but very difficult reading. Really only for Welsh legal historians and not curious novices.
4,It's a keeper,"I was pleasantly surprised by this movie and will keep it and watch it again. Sadly, the quality of the video isn't great. The packaging couldn't get more minimal. The English subtitles don't always state what is being said in the movie and sometimes are hard to see (white subtitles on white background). However, despite these limitations, it is an interesting story about women's expectations about and experiences with childbirth, and their relationship to men."
1,BRINK OF LIFE,"I ORDERED THIS THINKING THAT THIS WAS THE ORIGINAL JANUS FILMS VHS RELEASE, IT IS NOT. I HAVE RETURNED IT TWO WEEKS AGO FOR A FULL REFUND. THIS IS A KNOCK OFF OF VERY VERY POOR QUALITY LOOKS LIKE A CONSUMER VHS CAMERA POINTED AT A HOME SCREEN WITH AN OLD 16MM PRINT PLAYED TO MAKE THE VHS, NOT AN OFFICAL VHS OF THIS FILM. PLEASE REFUND AS THIS SHOULD HAVE ARRIVED AT AMAZON BY NOW.DENNIS E PIES"
3,Saturday Afternoon Suspense,"If you're looking to see Hitchcock in all his glory, absolutely go and find the Criterion Collection versions of your favourite Hitchcock films. However, if you don't know which ones are your favourite, yet, take a perusal through these movies. The films haven't been cleaned up and the audio is decent, so you can certainly go through the movies to see some older Hitchcock films, which are obvious seedlings of what was to come. ""The Lady Vanishes"" is worth the price of admission.And yes! There really are ten movies included here. What are they?(1927) LODGER - silent(1927) THE RING - silent(1929) BLACKMAIL - silent(1930) JUNO & THE PAYCOCK(1931) RICH & STRANGE(1934) THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH(1936) SABOTAGE(1936) SECRET AGENT(1937) YOUNG & INNOCENT(1938) THE LADY VANISHESHis other 9 movies from pre-Hollywood days (before 1940's ""Rebecca"") are available in the ""The Essential Alfred Hitchcock Collection"" (ASIN: B0009WPLVM)."
2,Not Quite As Expected...,"This collection of Hitchcock movies features his earliest movies. The main problem, however, with this collection is the audio. The audio quality on these films is so poor you can't understand the diologue half the time. And worse, when you can, the movies are just boring (with 2 of them being silent films). After watching Psycho and Dial M for Murder for the first time, I didn't expect this."
2,Brentwood omitted some facts,"For the price, enough good films on this set to make it a worthwhile purchase. HOWEVER, the manufacturer Brentwood, decided to omit the fact that 2 of the films are silent movies. Personally, I find a big difference between a silent and spoken dialogue film, and I believe this was no accident. I sent the comapny an email regarding this, but as with most online customer service, the recepient most likely just mumbled ""f**k y**"" and deleted the message."
2,DISAPPOINTING....,"to say the least! as good as the earlier reviews were of this book, i thought that for sure it'd be worth the time to read it. i must admit, the beginning was pretty good, but it just seemed to drag on from there. just dragging on with justine and duncan denying their feelings until you felt like saying, 'enough already!' stop the stupid dance of denial!all in all, i was disappointed, i guess i'll just wait until loure bussey or rochunda lee comes out with something new, seems like their the only two that pump out anything worth reading about."
5,awesome,Great book I was glued to it couldn't put it down. The characters were so realistic.everything about the book was just good from beginning to end
4,Wow!,"The main female character in this book is in two words...bold & determined. This is a love story. If that's what you're looking for well I needn't say anymore. The male character holds so much love. They are perfect for each other. I even like his sister in this book, she's so sarcastic :-) This is a really good choice. I'll probably read it again in a few months, lol."
5,A Must Read!!!,"This book was so good. This is the first book that I've read of hers and I want to read more. Justine and Duncan are great characters that are real and down to earth. I, too, wish that I could find a man like him."
3,Non-Modern Names....,This book was a bit disappointing to my husband and me... many of the names are out of date... there were not many new modern unusual names... however if you are looking for something older and less modern... this might be pretty good...
1,May have toasted my Zen V player.,Car / Auto and Wall / AC Essential Charger Kit w/ Tip Exchange for the Creative Zen V Plus - Gomadic BrandCar / Auto and Wall / AC Essential Charger Kit w/ Tip Exchange for the Creative Zen V Plus - Gomadic BrandAuto charger worked fine but AC charger may have toasted my Zen V player. My player quit working seconds after I plugged it in to the AC charger. When I tried to contact Gomadic they did not respond which makes me wonder if they are trying to avoid disclosing a defect in their product. I will not use that brand again.
5,Yes it does the job.,"I exercise with weights and an elliptical and I would have liked to lose some weight but I wasn't taking any action to do that. I'm not into diets or pills other than vitamins. I bought this product for the chromium component and not for any weight loss benefit. I've unexpectedly dropped 20 lbs from 220 to 200 (5'11"") after about six weeks."
3,Didn't do anything...good or bad.,"I guess I cannot complain too much. This product did not have bad side effects at all and it was not very expensive. But, it had no impact on my weightloss goal. I took it for a month and did not really notice anything. There was a decrease in appetite which I appreciate. I am not giving it one star because I have only taken it for a month....maybe longer term use would be better. I don't know. I will report back after I have taken it for a longer time, but so far....."
3,The old Tommy mara was great however.....,"...the new Tommy Mara ought to have kept quiet...This cd divides its space between some really good sides Mara recorded in the late 1940s and early 1950s when he had a great voice,excellent arrangements,and a superb sense of timing...apparently there were not enough of these old sides to fill out an entire cd,so Mara went back into the studio in the late 1990s and recorded some new sides...He should not have done so..The new Tommy Mara is winded,his vocals are raw,his voice a mere shadow of itself..He's a lot older now of course,but then so is Tony Bennett,and Bennett doesn't sound like he's taking his last few breaths,which is exactly the way the new Tommy Mara sounds..."
5,I use it every second day,"Most of my recipe books I use for one or two recipes at most, but this book is an exception. I've cooked about 20-30 recipes from here and now there are 15 that I cook monthly, some even weekly. Although it's titled a low fat cookbook, you just don't notice that the food is healthy as it's all hearty and full of flavours. My favourites are italian bean stew, bacon broad bean potato supper, creamy pork with peppers, courgette and bean soup, falafel patties, mediterranean baked chicken and rice and chicken chow mien. The book is divided into chapters on snacks and starters; soups; grills; casseroles, braises and stews; roasts and bakes; quick hob suppers; pasta, rice and grains; salads; desserts and bakes; dressings sauces and stocks. I could easily throw away every other cook book I have and live only with this one."
4,"The Americanized version of Ferry Corsten, Tiesto, Buuren.","George Acosta is definitely a great DJ, but my only criticism is that he doesn't bring anything different to the table than the famous Dutch DJs - other than he plays these tunes 6 - 8 months later than them.Bottom line is it's a great mix. Most of these songs can already be heard on other compilations from 2003 but it's still enjoyable."
4,This is NOT house,"This is definitely trance, you need to recheck your clubbing music before passing judgement. I was fairly impressed with the cd and it's grown on me a lot since buying it. I do have to admit that I enjoy the first cd better, and the first half of the first cd is the best. I especially love ""Rush"" and ""Stealing Beauty""....In ""Rush"", you can def. tell the difference in the trance breakdown right around 2:35 in, the first set ends, then about 2:58, the next mix kicks in....a GREAT first few songs to kick your bumpage up a notch before going into a club, or hell, coming out of one on the drive home! :) Also an amazing batch to workout to, esp. for cardio schtuff.....the last few songs on the first cd tend to trail off and are MUCH lighter..The second cd is harder trance...MUCH harder, lol, but still good. I feel like I spend more time listening to the first cd though just for the sake that you may hear that more in mainstream clubs.Buzz/Nation clubber, signing out :)"
5,Absolutely Stunning,"This is the first CD I've heard from George Acosta.. and I have to say that I was really moved by the beats. Although there are a couple tracks on this CD I've heard before, he really brings hard beats to melodic trance. The whole CD is consistent with beats and it doesn't really break at anytime - something that I am always looking for when I am buying trance music.Without question - this is one of the best I've heard, and I'm a big fan of the trance music genre. If you like dance music with a good hard beat that is consistent throughout - look no further than Miami."
1,ugh...,This is the only dance CD I owned that I was glad to see get stolen when my car got busted into.I hope they hated it as much as I did...Just no flow to this cd at all.
4,"This is NOT house, listen, Not house.","I don't like to write reviews normally but after reading someone's review and he kept saying this is all house and I really want to write something back. This is definately NOT house music, it is TRANCE and progressive TRANCE. If you can't tell the difference btw house and trance, you should just go listen rap and hip hop."
2,"An average release, but George could've done better","I'll start with disc 2. The first three songs get you in a mood that the rest of the cd can't provide. The only exception is Zed X's ""The Storm"", which should've been track 4, that way the only good songs would've been grouped together! I'll give cd 1 a solid 3 stars just cause I'm more into hard trance, and I don't mean that progressive crap on cd 2. I mean real hard trance, like George's Touched cd 2. Anyway, cd 1 on Miami provides such an emotional feel. It's definitely George's most emotional cd yet. ""Push Through"", ""Let the light shine in"", and ""Waiting"" is the best streak of songs for me. Especially ""Let the light shine in"", such powerful vocals! I love Jono Grant!! However, PVD's ""Time of our lives"" has no business on here!!"
3,"Good selection, poor production","This is not a bad disc, it just isn't a great disc.GA's track selection shows that he is no doubt on top of his genre, but unfortunately the transitions are somewhat simple if not flawed. There just isn't anything unique or powerfull about this compilation. I guess if one was to consider that he is an American trance DJ, he should be given credit since there are not a lot of good trance DJs in this country.This disc is just music, it's not an experience and for what it's worth, it will do the trick."
2,miami,this CD is not a good mix of any kind. Cd one is boring to death with no variation in theme or rythtym or pace; Epic Trance. Cd 2 is a bit more likable with more progressiveness however the tracks that were selected for this mix are a bit dated and annoying. this is the music people listen and THINK this is what trance is. The only good track is Pure Thrust with Nu NRG. Pass! you'll be glad you did!
3,boring!,"cd 1 is good, cd 2 is boring! this cd sounds too much like awake. nothing new and exciting, nothing that really gets you going. i dont recommend!"
4,It takes a few times to really enjoy it!,"I did not like this album the first few times of listening to it. I feel in love with ""Touched"" and I was so excited to purchase this one. I thought that it was going to be more of a good thing. I was really unhappy in the beginning. I've given it a few spins and I'm starting to enjoy it. I do not think that it is as good as ""Touched."" ""Miami"" is a more darker and heavier album. I think that George is still moving forward in the trance world. I just think that the tone of this album is not what Acosta's fans are used to. It is a great album with more of a disturbing edge to it. Not bad at all. You just have to be in the mood for this one."
3,Disappointed,"I think this would have been more enjoyable if the sound had been improved. With a few exceptions it sounds like one is listening to the LP of this show that was issued in 1955. The sound is uneven and makes the singers voices very unattractive.Albert Hague's music and lyrics are very uninteresting. One popular song from the 50's came out of this show ""Young and Foolish"". David Daniels and Gloria Marlowe acquit themselves admirably in this number.The saving grace is the fact that Barbara Cook was in the show. It's always a joy to listen to her even if the recording makes her voice seem a bit shrill and uneven. What a pity.I am puzzled as to why DRG reissued this. There are a few photos and some liner notes that were penned by Barbara Cook this year.Too bad they didn't improve the sound quality.Oh well"
5,It's GREAT!,"Saw the play many years ago, and my folks had the original cast album on vinyl. The CD was excellent quality and brought back a lot of memories. The play is still being produced (I think somewhere in Indiana) - I'd love to see it again!"
3,medocre score,"a meiocre score but nice to have Barbara Cook's performance on record.Best song is City Mouse, Country Mouse, otherwise a forgettabel score."
2,Pleasant but not terribly exciting,"Then there are the 1950s musicals that were hits, ran a season and were promptly forgotten. This is one of them. Nothing really terribly wrong with the score...but there is nothing to get excited about either. The earlier CD reissue by Broadway Angel has better notes and more pictures in the booklet."
5,"Beautiful, baby!","At this time in his career, Satch began to play with musicians more worthy of his incredible talent. These are incomparably good performances.JSP has done a masterful job with the sound quality of these sessions, much better than the releases offered by other companies. A must have, and I don't say that lightly."
1,Cute but not fun,"I will say it looks good;however, the kids seem to loose interest quickly. Maybe if a very young one had a chance fun would be had. As far as my little one no. The string on the drum sticks are far too short even for little ones."
5,Travel Focused Binocular,"Feature rich binoculers that provide a wide range of zoom and crytal clear optics. Slightly heavier than some, but also appear to be rugged. Slip free coasting provides and excellant hand grip."
2,"I wanted zoom binoculars, but these are not as good as the fixed magnification binoculars","These zoom from 8 to 16 power, but they are extremely blurry at the higher magnifications. I already have 10 power fixed Pentax binoculars and they performed so well that I naturally went to Pentax when I wanted to upgrade.If I had it to do over again, I would not have purchased this."
5,Binocular,"Used them at a couple of sporting events and they worked very well. Here are your seven , yes seven more words."
3,Average quality,"i was looking for a compact binocular to use at basketball sporting events and enjoying the wildlife in the back yard. A little oversized for my liking. The opticas are ok, works best in bright light - less well in arenas."
2,Pentax Zoom Binocular 16x21,Very disappointed. Easy to use but did not provide the magnification I had expected. Not worth the money. My less expensive binocularsdo a better job.
5,Nice Binoculars,Purchased for my 13 year old grandson for Christmas. He loved the zoom lens. He also liked the fact they are very compact and come with a nice case. Item was shipped very fast!
3,narrow,These chairs are pretty and match my decor but the seat seems more narrow than a standard sized dining chair.
3,Too little info from Amazon,"These chairs are attractive, but Amazon failed to mention that they have a 225 lb. limit. I didn't know it until after I purchased 2 sets for my mother. While putting cushioned tips on the legs, I found it written on the bottom of the chairs. That was never mentioned in the description. Very disappointing. If you don't have any large friends or family members, they are very nice."
3,They work I suppose,"I was not real happy with these chairs. They aren't very sturdy, so if you have overweight people in your household, these are definately NOT the chairs for you. Granted, the price is low on them, but I would probably have been just as well off with using folding chairs."
5,Excellent Sound. Better Than The Sennheiser PX-100.,"I've owned both these and the Sennheiser PX-100 that I often see praised in reviews on Amazon. I disagree. I think the Sony's sound is nearly perfect, rich, clear sound with superb bass, and so far they have held up well. The Sennheisers sounded clear but boring, kind of flat sounding with little bass. Also, I accidentally tugged the cord on one ear of the Sennheisers, as I've done with almost all my headphones when I'm active, and forever after that, that ear made a buzzing noise when I listened to certain artists, rendering them useless and worthless. The Sony's are the best lightweight headphones I have ever had, and I highly recommend them over any others."
4,very good but not what I expected,"They sound great, look great, etc. However I was trying to find something that I could crank up at the gym and not annoy people around me. I realize buds would be the best choice, however I was hunting for something other than buds since they fall out once you begin to sweat, and I'm just not a fan of buds in my ears.Everything I could find led to these headphones as my best option, but sadly, the noise leaks just as it did with my previous headphones.I have since purchased Sennheisers/addidas that wrap around the back of the neck and are a bud type of headphone but do not go completely into my ears.I'm happy with them.These sonys have become my computer headphones and serve that purpose well."
3,Folding feature great but not very comfortable,Pros:-folding mechanism great and I actually use the storage case too-pretty cheap-sound doesn't seem to escape from them that much considering they are open air (aka i can listen to them relativley loud in the library without pissing off the dude next to me)Cons:-I find that they're uncomfortable to wear for long periods of time. the earpads are not that soft and because they bend so much to fold up they fit very tightly on your head (my head is not that big)-sound is so-so but that's probably what you're gonna get at this priceSummary:comfort's important so I might look elsewhere
2,MDR,"I had several Sony MDR headphones in the past and I liked them, currently I have and really like Sony MDR7506 which helped me to ignore all bad reviews for this headphones. I had expected little bit downsized version of MDR7506 or at least something close to Fontopia headphones but MDR710LP does not come close. Build quality is good for light headphones but sound is horrible, it is dull and muddy. I would feel better if I had lost money spent on these headphones. This is hardly an upgrade for headphones that come with ipod."
2,"Compact design gets in the way, sound is poor.","When not on my head, the fold-up design makes handling these headphones awkward. When on my head, I wish I had bought something else."
2,Not comfortable,"The sound quality is OK (perhaps a bit too much bass for the music I usually listen to), but the worst problem is the comfort, or lack thereof. They felt pretty good at first, but after I wore them for a few hours, they really hurt my ears. I think their ability to fold up so compactly really hurts the level of comfort--they want to fold up, not sit firmly, on your head. I will need to reserve these for my subway commute (30 mins) and for not much more than that if I want to use them at all. Sigh."
3,"Could be better,........","Sound quality is pretty good, 4 stars, but the build quality is HORRIBLE!!! I have these and they started giving probs almost immediately, should have returned them but let the RMA period lapse (MY BAD!!!). For great sound AND better build quality get the Sennhieser PX100's - you really can't go wrong - especially at that price point!!! And they're $39.99 on Amazon!!!"
2,Not worth the money,"If you are looking for headphones and do not want to shell out the money for bose or another hi-end model DO NOT BUY THIS product as you will regret the decision. Instead, stick with some cheaper ear buds."
4,Good hands-on,"This is an excellent resource book for middle school classes. The projects are cheap, using items you probably have in your classroom. They are hands-on,yet well organized. I have 33 students in one class and almost all of these projects can be done in this environment. Great for your kinesthetic and visual spatial learners."
5,"Pastor, You Don't Even Understand How Much You Should Read This Book. Seriously","People are always too enthusiastic about books and say silly things like, ""Everyone should read this!"" ""It's A Must-Read!"" So what can I say that hasn't already been said and won't just be written off as some misguided enthusiasm? I'm not sure, but after a personal conversation with Tim Keller, pastor of Redeemer Presbyterian in New York, who assured me that he has built his entire ministry on the foundation he found in this book, I am more convinced than ever that pastors and ministry leaders truly need to read the material in this book.We all want God to renew the church and bring revival. This book is the most clear, balanced, Biblical, insightful, spiritually intelligent thing I have ever come across that truly gives me hope and splendid instruction for how to cultivate such renewal and revival.Read it."
1,Wasted water,I purchased this 502 toilet flapper and had the chain catch up between the dial a flush and the hard plastic arm that holds it. The flapper worked well when it closed but 20 percent of the flushes it held open wasting gallons of water. I bought a Korky and it is working very well.
5,Great pictoral of New York's water supplies,"A great selection of photographs of the hidden and not so hidden elements of the water supply in New York. Growing up in Putnam County I saw many of these things and was mesmerized by them, but didn't get close enough to see these wonderful views. This book allows me to relive my childhood and go closer than I ever dared to go."
5,It Works!,"I wasn't too sure about using it at first but it really does help. Some friends have complained about the coconut smell - I don't think it's too bad, but if you don't like coconut you probably shouldn't try it."
3,Not there yet...,This is not quite the product I'D hoped for. Arrived as hard wax that was almost impossible to remove from its container. Once I figured how to get it out it was fine.
3,Excellent book but..............,"This is an excellent book learning OOP in Java. I am self learner, I found this book has good introduction to OOP concept early. What disappoint me was absence of answers to the chapter exercises which is very useful to check the answer to the exercises to enhance learning. Otherwise I would say the chapter exercises is slightly better than useless especially to those who has no 'teacher' to check the answer. The answer actually available online in the book's website but for teachers only and password protected. I don't understand why the answer to chapter exercises has to be a secret!!"
2,"blueJ is ok, but this book isn't","Reading this book is not a very pleasant experience. You can't quickly look up any little thing you might want to know about whithout beeing forced to work through lots of excercises, examplecodes etc. Every explanation seem to refere to other parts of the book, and other excercises. The right way, and only way to read this book is to read it from cover to cover, and work through every single excercise. I quess that if you have the time and patience to do so, you will learn(that is why I rated it 2 instead of 1).Another thing that buggs me is the way the text in the book is formatted. Important words are written with a very thin font, and this really disturbs the flow of reading.I recommend the BlueJ software, it's easy and helpful, but I don't recommend this book, it's frustrating and unhelpful."
3,Not for new Java learners,"I am learning Java on my own and had minimum exposure to programming. I have tried this book. Yes, it is good approach to teach OO with Java, but at the end I could not write program in Java confidently. I've tried other book that also emphasized on early OO approach. I can understand the concept but cannot write meaningful application. Then I got the book Introduction to JAVA programming 6th Edition, Comprehensive version by Daniel Liang. This book actually give me understanding and make sense that the previous beginner's book tried to emphasized. It gave me gentle introduction starting form very fundamental of programming to OO concept. The transition from fundamental concept to OO concept was painless.In short, to me the Object Frst with JAVA is more suitable to peoples who have 'some' exposure to basic programming."
2,"Maybe good for OOP, but not for real JAVA","I am using this book for JAVA class at my University. It really sucks, because my teacher teaches like most other books teach, and this book has some weird pedagogical method of teaching objects rather than syntax. Terrible when your teacher wants to teach his way and it conflicts with this book.Quick and easy example why NOT to buy this book: The ""main"" function is not mentioned ONCE in this book. NOT ONCE. So when people with zero programming experience started seeing my teacher put main up on the board, they were lost.The compiler is more of a visual JAVA and would be great for an OOP class. But to learn JAVA its awful. It tried to avoid ""syntax"" yet it has complicated programs where knowing syntax is necessary. Skip this one unless you want to get a better handle on OOP after having learned JAVA."
3,Good beginner's book,"This book covers a lot of the fundamentals of programming in Java. A lot of the concepts apply to programming as a whole really. Personally I enjoy the style of creating a problem scenario and then problem solving my way out of it. Especially with this sort of material, just reading how to do what gets really tiring in a hurry (for most people).I do, however, have several problems with this text:a) As far as I can tell, there are no solutions to the exercises as the end of each chapter to check your workb) This textbook uses BlueJ, which shortly after learning Java becomes more of a hindrance than a helpc) I would have liked perhaps a project style do-it-yourself at the end of each chapter. They sort of do this, but not how I had in mind. It might just be that this is hard to implement at the amateur level though.All in all, this book is okay, but not awesome."
3,Horrible editing,I quite enjoyed this book but the editing really spoiled it for me. Up to 5 rogue hyphens per page breaking up words needlessly really spoiled the flow.
4,A Great Series,"I just discovered this author and have purchased several of her books. They are a great read. The period details aren't too bad (one other reader pointed out an anachronism). The heroines and situations are believable and the story is well written. Even the supporting characters are realistic (well, there do have to be a few straw men). The details of the story seem pretty appropriate for the time, if not totally true to life (I don't think any 21st century woman would be comfortable in the totally true to life shoes of a regency woman), Ms Matthews' heroines don't act like modern women or assume modern viewpoints, but they aren't passive either. The heroes are very likable from the start (no arrogant aristocrats that suddenly become nice guys at the end - not that these can't be fun) and there aren't pages and pages of explicit details on anyone's love life. Moderately priced, too. I recommend this series highly.The Village Spinster"
5,"If you like ROMANCE and PASSION, you'll love this book!","This book has everything you want in a romance novel; a interesting storyline, strong characters, the excitement of new love, and very passionate romance! The interwoven storylines will captivate you. And you'll like the personalities of the main characters; Eve and Noah. I like the way the author made Eve intelligent and independent, yet still possessing a vulnerable side. Noah is strong, protective and a passionate lover. You won't be disappointed if you buy this book!"
4,Noah knows how to start and put out a fire!,"This was my first book by Ms. Arnold and I'm pleased to say ""Eve's Prescription"" won't be my last! I enjoyed this story about prosecutor Eve Garrett and her hunk of a fireman, Noah Russell. A widow and raising a teenage son alone, Eve forgot what lust, romance and loving felt like -- until Noah.Although, Noah had a reputation for being a ladies' man, but there was so much more about him. (He was the perfect example of not judging a book by its cover.) Eve was just too afraid and insecure to find out what this gorgeous brother was really all about. However, girlfriend's feelings of jealously, passion and happiness, all associated with Noah, started to work on her mind and heart.Ms. Arnold really brought the characters to life. At times, I wanted to smack Eve and say ""snap out of it and get on with life with a man who is crazy about you."" I fell completely in love with Noah. (Yummy!) He could light my fire any time! Great book."
1,Unless you have nothing else to read....,"I agreed with the other writer that gives this book a 1 star. More than 1/2 of the book is dedicated to its construction, and the paranoid that goes into covering its existence. There is not much information about the crew, or its battle, though I guess the Musashi did not take part in any major battle till the end... kind of like the Bismarck.. this book is nothing compared to Saboro Sakai's Samurai, which is a much better read."
2,Battleship Musashi,"I purchased the book with great enthusiasm for I am fanatically interested in the design and construction of the Musashi.Unfortunately the book didn`t satisfy any of my interests..Rather than detail the making of the Musashi it wandered off into the problems associated in keeping the construction hidden.. I am no more enlightened than I was before I read the book. If you are interested enough in the making of the Musashi that this book would appeal to you, then you probably already know more than the book offers.."
4,OK by me,"Since I am not interested in technical engineering details of the construction of ships, I did not mind that almost all the information on this subject was confined to a few diagrams. I enjoyed the discussion of the secrecy aspects of the construction. The only negatives for me were the rather brief summary of the sinking, and the failure to put the Musashi's mission at that time into a broader strategic framework."
4,A good continuation...,"This picks up right where the last volume left off of course. It showcases team BBA Revolution taking on the Blitzkrieg Boys, as well as White Tiger X and PPB All Starz against the F Dynasty. This volume also has the original uncut subbed japanese version, which is oddly select through a language menu, I expected it under Extras. Oh well. A good show I'm looking forward to the future uncut battles like Tyson vs Kai."
5,A Crash Course in Trade Shows,"One of my company's business managers decided he would like to make the leap from attending a trade show to exhibiting at one, so we signed up for a booth and received the standard three-ring binder of information and forms. One trip through that book was enough to convince us that we needed to know *a lot* more about trade shows -- and fast. I ordered this book based on another reader review of it that is posted here. The book is well-written, concise, and covers every aspect of trade shows from what equipment you really need to how to read the body language of attendees. It's an excellent analysis of the marketing strategy you should apply to trade show attendance, and covers in detail what to do before the show, at the show and after the show. In short, it's just what we needed: a ""crash course"" in trade shows."
4,Great basic ideas for all size trade show displays,This is a great book to educate or reaffirm tested ideas to ensure trade show success. You can relate a lot of the ideas and examples back to your own scenario. I got a great deal of onfo out of this book and thoroughly recommend it to anyone who wants to make their next trade show a success.
1,Right-wing rant in favour of unregulated advertising,This book is an apology for unregulated advertising in the face of its critics. It is pro big business and does not take the critics of advertsing seriously. There is little historical analysis either.
2,"Good for cell, not for cpu.","The Sony Open-air fit my cell phone outlet and had good sound even though there was some background noise. I purchased them, though, to use with my office cpu. They buzz in my ears and only work on one side. I recommend them as an inexpensive headset for use with cell phone, but not for us with computer."
1,Bad choice,"These sound terrible compared to 3 other headphones I have under $15, I'd return them but I threw out the packaging and it wouldn't be worth the trouble.I just received a pair of JVC Flats and they sound great and I haven't even broken them in. I need another pair of headphones so I'm considering getting another pair of Flats, or trying a pair of MEElectronics HT-21 which I like because there's only one line going into the headphone."
2,Headphones for music listening,"Because this headphone set is so inexpensive, I will give it 2 stars. However, the audio sound is quite weak, therefore, the set really should receive 1 star."
3,"Well put together for the price, but no better sound than ear buds.","I have some huge XD200 Sony ear cup headphones that I use on the computer that have full sound and great bass. I have some little J10 earbuds I use for running that have no bass, but pretty good sound. I had hoped these 210's would be somewhere in the middle in terms of sound quality, being bigger than earbuds and smaller than full studio headphones. But they really have about the same sound as the J10 earbuds. Very moderate bass, but good overall mid and highs. I guess I would consider them an alternative rather than an upgrade.Overall, good headphones for a very good price. I remember my old cassette walkman in the early 90s coming with something similar."
4,Comfortable and affordable. I think it has good sound for everyday use.,Comfy fit and good sound at a low price. I would recommend it to friends for sure. In fact I got my father these same ones too.
5,Decent headphones,I bought these to go along with a CD Walkman for a 6th grader. Did not want the small ear plugs that fit directly into the ears. These will do the job for her for a while.
2,Product is nice but not the description,"I bought these headphones because I read these were foldable phones, but they are not. My rate is for the seller, because for the headphones I will give it 4 stars!"
4,Good listening,"Good value for the price. I often find that headphones are too large to fit comfortably, but these adjust just right for me."
3,Headphone,It's okay but volume should be higher or have extra control attached to cord to make volume increase. It does its job to an extent but I can hear whatever is going on around me.
2,Very comfortable but sound awful.,"I bought these because my Phillips around-the-ear headphones pinch my ears. Those sound great but I can't stand to wear them for more than five minutes at a time. These Sony ones are comfy, but they sound terrible. No bass, and I think the louder the music gets, the quieter the headphones become. They're annoying."
4,good remixes,"good remixes are hard to come by. this album is actually very good. the first two tracks leave a little to be desiered but the cex remix makes up for everything. it is excellent. there is a bunch of worth while material in this, so i think its worth it"
2,"Good GENERAL cat book, a little disappointed,though.","I bought the book looking for specific information about Persians. What I got was a little information about Persians and a lot of information about cats in general. I guess if I were interested in breeding or showing, this might be the book to buy, but for a simple cat fancier, it doesn't do it for me."
2,Not very Persian focused,All the information in there I can find it in a cats magazine. VERY basic information and quite obvious.
4,"""A Definite Should Try""","It's a wonderful book. Rather on the dark side but a deviation from your usual the-female-save-the-suffering-male type. If you ever read a book titled Redeeming Love by Francine Rivers and love it, you will enjoy this one."
1,He's a monster,"The ""hero"" rapes the heroine multiple times. Not ""she says no but really means yes"" - it's RAPE. No book recovers from that for me. I wish I could give it zero stars."
3,shaver foil flaw,"This is an awesome shaver. I bought 1 for my husband 2 years ago. The only flaw we have found is that after a few months the shaver head gets minior holes in it that tear up his face when he shaves. There are replacement foils, but its kind of a pain to send away for it"
2,Buyer beware!!!!!!,"The good: Self cleaning, smart-charging system, comfy shaveThe bad: Did lousy job shaving tough areas (neck), took a LONG time to shave normal areas, finally broke in less than a month out of the box!!Bottom line: Not worth the money, so I returned it and went back to Norelco ..."
1,refurb crap,refurbished razor trimmer could not be retracted and couldn't be turned off. factory serviced means little. supplier is out of stock. waiting for replacement. sorry i every ordered it.
3,"Fine shaver, BUT...","I've owned numerous electric shavers, and have consistently found Braun models to be superior for my needs. The Syncro system would appear to offer not only a clean shave, but also the ultimate convenience of a self-cleaning function.So why the 3-star rating? The locking mechanism on top of the cleaning station breaks easily; specifically, it ceases to stay in the locked (down) position which activates the cleaning function and keeps the shaver charged. I've gone through two units in two years, both failing in exactly the same fashion. This is particularly disappointing, because I expect more durability and better designs from the Germans."
2,GOOD UNTIL...,"the CLEAN and CHARGE center broke after only a couple of months, wont stay down which from what i've read is a known problem, there are even repair centers for it. bad design."
1,Clean and Charge Base Doesn't Work,"While the shaver itself is a good product, my clean and charge base failed shortly after my purchase. It would no longer latch and thus couldn't be used. Telephone calls to Braun revealed that they have had a number of such failures, but they would not replace the defective base even within the warranty period; one could send it at one's own expense to a repair facility. Unless one is willing to accept frustration with the base, I would recommend against its purchase. Even though I've owned sevral previous Braun shavers, I'd hesitate to buy another from a firm that won't stand fully behind its products."
1,"close, but . . .","I've tried several times to give this thing three stars, but the interface seems to be a piece of junk. Pay no attention if there's only one star there . . . this thing rates at least a 3.I can't get a decent shave with anything, so I try lots of different approaches. This gozmo is as good as any Ive tried. I get as close a shave as I can manage with a blade, and with a lot less trouble. The self-cleaning mechanism is very cool, though I'll have to buy refills for it once a month or so . . . haven't checked out how much those will cost yet.The shave's no worse than I get with anything else, but I was hoping for something significantly better. Maybe I'll go back to just having a beard."
3,Don't need the gizmo - found something that works w/o one,"Tested three shavers and wet/dry Panasonic ES8092NC worked the best for me. Please check reviews under the Panasonic ES8092NC and ES8095NC. The Braun shaved very well also, but the Panasonic was somewhat closer. And, without the gizmo/toy/$ to clean it. Just water and soap - and it works.For the Braun - well built and close shave, but one star off for the decorative/size aspect, second star off for the addtional maintenance cost and noise (which apparently increases with time).The third shaver was a differnt story - Mr. Bond's Norelco 8894XL Spectra. The battery died at the end of the second shave! Dead - period! I know two days is not much, and that I am supposed to wait to two weeks for conclusions (what is the hair `brain' science behind this anyway?). However, it worked poorly for me from the beginning."
4,first norelco and then Braun,"Well, I first shave with an old norelco 985rx under the chin, then I finish with the Braun.Foil shavers just do not cut it under the chin."
1,A pretty package.... That's about it....,"If you have 10-15 minutes to shave in the morning... Buy this razor... Then after a couple of weeks the razor begins to vibrate and becomes ""VERY"" noisey... You will have no problem waking up... The owners manuel should recommend earplugs... Braun makes great coffee makers... They should stick to that... Don't waste your money..."
1,CLEANER DOES NOT LATCH,"I bought TWO of these shavers over the period of a year. While the shaver itself is the best on the market, the cleaning mechanism does not work as it should. The spring latch breaks and will not allow you to charge or clean the shaver. Read some of the other reviews. I'm not the only one experiencing this obvious design flaw. I was very dissappointed and have returned it to Amazon.com. I also called Braun customer service to register a complaint. The engineers on this product need to go back to the drawing board. They have the potential for a great product."
4,Good,"Great for and electric razor, but does not eliminate all the razor burn if you have sensitive skin. It has been 6 months and I still get red bumps. Easy clean, easy to travel with."
1,Have had 2 break in a year.,"I have had two of these razors. They shaved well enough but 4 months into use with my first it started to get really loud and not shave well at all. I sent it in for a replacement and now the new one is doing the same thing after only a couple months use. Very, Very poor build quality. It is a shame since when new this razor worked quite well. Back to the blade for me."
3,Similiar Problems with stand,"I also had the identicle problem with the charging cleaning stand. The lock down mechanism failed after about 8 months of use. Other than that, this is an excelent shaver!"
2,Cleaning unit breaks,Like so many other people on this board my cleaning unit broke after a few months. First the tab won't stay down then the unit falls apart. Great shaver though but with out the cleaning unit not nearly worth the price. Also the cleaning solution is $5 a month or two. My friend's unit broke also.
4,"Good shaver, but too noisy","This is a nice shaver. My main complaint is the noise. Compared with Norelco rotary shaver, this one is clearly much noiser."
2,Disappointed,Lots of great features. The only thing thing this system doesn't do well is shave. I find myself shaving 3 times as often as I used to.
1,Foil issues,"I have the previous model 7570 which gives a great shave but the foil wears out about every 9 months so except to replace them at $25 each. Also, had to replace the cleaning system that broke after about a year as noted by another reviewer."
4,Like the name,Best shaver if you're afflicted with fuzzy logic. (I haven't used the shaver--just like the name.)
1,Bad battery,"When I bought the new Braun 7680 Shaver about three years ago, the manual says that the rechargable battery would be good for three to five years. Recently the battery started to perform abnomally. I decided to purchase a refurbished one of the same model when I had a trip to go. Unfortunately after four times it was used with about three minutes for each time, the battery was dead. I am very disappointed at it because I totally unexpected this to happen. I suspect that they did not change the battery when they refurbished it.Of course now I want to know if the battery is new for the refurbished device. I will not buy it if the battery is not replaced with a new one."
2,Very disapointed,I bought the Braun 7680 refurbished even after being a little bit concerned with the number of refurbished units available.I now can understand why the shavers were returned.This is my second attempt to use an electric razor. I had one years ago but It did not give me the shave I desired and I went back to a regular razor.This shaver is incpable of cutting whiskers after a three day growth. I go over spots where I might have missed during my last shave without being able to cut them. I thought that the 7000 series would be outstanding but this particular model failed the test.I thought of returning the shaver but I did not and I don't remember your return policy.I have seen ads on TV showing a man with a growth of probably 5-7 days cutting right through with a 3000 series. I wonder if this is true or just a staged event.I would appreciate any assistance you may be able to give me on this problem.Thomas D. Mc Nulty
4,Braun shaver,I have used the shaver for over a month and it works like a charm.Worth the money and would recommend it to anyone.Delivery was fast and without any problem.The purchase was made through Amazon and as usual no problems.
2,"Great shaver for its time, but that time is now up","For under $70, this is not a bad price for a shaver of this design with LCD display and side pulsing technology. But this is just the shaver by itself. It does not come with the cleaning station it was originally packaged with. But even worse, it does NOT come with the charging cord! I checked with the supplier. You get ONLY the shaver. This is being sold as a replacement unit.Besides, this is the older 7000 series model, several generations behind the latest Braun shaver model. Braun has made some really nice improvements at this point. I strongly suggest not wasting your money on this older technology. Invest a few extra $$ and at least get the 8000 series or the newest model. You'll be glad you did."
1,Mine broke after six months,"My Braun 7680 suddenly began making a loud noise after about six months. It still shaves, but it makes so much noise that I cannot use it while my wife is still asleep in the bedroom for fear of waking her up.This is a fairly expensive razor, I expected more from it."
4,The Destructor,"What a piece of work this guy was. He is not only self-destructive but he left a path of destruction where ever he went. People paid this maniac big bucks so they could exploit their workers to the maximum.He was ahead of his time. He would fit in perfectly with the corrupt, deranged, far right businesses in our current economic climate.A decent read for a research project."
5,Well-written and astute,"A well-written and comprehensive account of a labor relations consultant's misdeeds. Catalogues with many accute psychological observations the harm many managers and labor relations consultants cause workers through wrong actions--often, he confesses, willfully. Also, the personal experience of holding a destructive job and the accompanying mechanisms denial are important to understand, both in this book and in all our lives as workers, consultants, or managers. In his career, Levitt's cycle of destructive work was linked with alcoholism and compensatory over-spending, and the authors make it clear that the personal psychological knots of consultants and managers perpetuate their wrong actions and livelihoods. This narration is heartrending and sickening, but is a vital call to examination of the labor crimes in this country and of personal responsibility for suffering."
1,Easy Release.... in Pieces,"I'm returning my pans because even though I sprayed them, the cake still stuck in parts and didn't all come out smoothly. Plus the two layers were all warped and not the same shape. My cakes still look bad and I'm totally disappointed. They don't clean any easier than the metal pans. There were also big airholes in the batter that I normally don't have - and this was a simple box cake!"
4,after a few days hard use,"I've used this light for a good 20 or so hours. It works well, I really like it so far. I would have given it 5 stars but for two things. The hook could be a touch better but this is not really bad. Secondly, when the battery becomes discharged the light just shuts off. I believe this is common with these kinds of lights. A warning of some sort like an induced flicker or a beep would be great. If you are going into a totally dark hole or area, bring a backup light just in case you run out of juice with this one. I recommend this light but it is made in China."
1,Keeps going off - won't stay lit.,Bought this as part of a set - worked well to start with then light kept going off at crutial moments. Rest of set great - this is rubbish - looking at number of other people with problems it must be a design issue.
2,"Returned, failed after 1 hour of use","I have many DeWalt products and have generally had great luck with them. This light was the exception. After about an hour of use, noticed an acrid smell and the light just stopped working. Returned and haven't tried again. Probably just a defective unit rather than a design flaw."
2,Light Quality Questionable,"I have the Dewalt Lantern and figured I'd love this. But the light quality is really poor and the beam spread so wide it's not putting a lot of light anywhere. It's okay, but the old lantern will get most of my use."
1,died after 2 months,"I bought this along with Dewalt's DW908 (which works flawlessly). This light did its job and did it well for about 2 months. One evening while working in the garage with it, it just stopped working. Nobody hit it, dropped it, etc. It was hanging under the hood throwing off light and poof...it just died. I changed out the battery to a fully charged one and the light would not work. I bought a replacement bulb, still nothing. I put a multimeter into the bulb sockets (there are 4 so I tried all combinations)....no power. I called and emailed DeWalt and never got a response. It's too bad. I own the other light along with some of their 18V power tools and they all work great. giving this 1 star due to the fact that it did not last and I got no reply from DeWalt about it."
2,Just Fine.,"I would for sure reccomend getting the 18v flexible dewalt light rather than this. The flexible light can wrap around a 2x4 or tree limb, or can simply set on the ground and point to where you want it to. The flourescent does give off a better light, the flexible light is half the price and still very bright."
5,Very pleased,"Works even better than expected. Lights up a dark room very well for installing cabinets, driving screws, etc. Stays cool, easy to carry and locate. Have not yet run out a battery."
2,not impressed crazy/ price increase,"Aside from longer battery life i see no advantage for this light as it does not provide enough DIRECTED light and is expensive now as amazon raised the price from $23 to $50 , that is over 100%! Come on amazon that is excessive. It was not even worth the $23 . It is just a bulb and a plastic holder. The DW charger light is a much better product as another reviewer has said."
3,Handy Addition to Workspace for owners of DEWALT 18-volt NiCd Batteries,"I had purchased a DEWALT portable drill which came with 2 18v NiCd batteries. I have since purchased an impact driver (without) battery and my latest acquisition was the fluorescent area light. The light is not as bright as I expected but is adequate for a small work area.As other reviewers have observed there is no warning when the battery is weakening, i.e., the light is either on or off. I have since purchased an incandescent DEWALT lamp which is a nice complement to the fluorescent lamp."
3,DeWalt Rechargeable Lantern,"I bought this for my hurricane preparation kit. I already own the DeWalt DCD950 hammer drill so this would share batteries. I need lighting for 36-72 hours without electricity. Remember that gale force winds can last two days or more and with windows boarded up, it's like living in a cave for a few days. This lamp lasts 4 hours with a freshly charged, brand new XRP battery. That's enough time to prepare a meal, eat & clean up but that's about it. I'll guess I would need at least 8 fresh batteries to make it without being in the dark. I'd better start looking for a LED version of this lantern."
5,Dewalt fluorescent light,"The Dewalt area light is very rugged and gives off a fair amount of light with long runtime. Could be used for home repairs, the professional do it yourselfer or the jobsite. Heck, could even be used during a power outtage as emergency lighting."
4,good light,"Good product. Works well. I get a bit over 4 hrs of use from a fresh XRP pack. Was concerned about the light not working on cold days, but it worked even though it had sat in below zero F temperature for 24-48 hours before use. The shroud is a bit too easy to unlock,but overall its a good light."
5,AREA LIGHT SAVES THE DAY,I have a problem with sump water in my basement. It pumps 5 gal. every 5 min. When we have a power outage I have to get my generator started and hooked up to the house. I have used a flashlight before and is a huge problem trying to fill the gas tank and hold the light. The DEWALT DC527 area light solves this problem. I just set it on the work bench and take care of the generator then restart the unit. This is a well thought out solution to my problem.
1,Worked for a day then died,This light worked fine for a day and then quit. I tried replacing the bulb to no avail. Then made the mistake of opening the unit to see if there was a loose wire- never could get it reassembled.
1,Burned less than an hour before overheating,"I was using my new light the very next day after receiving it. It worked for less than an hour and went out. I tried to pick it up to put a new battery on it, but it was too hot to touch. The light smelled like it had burned something inside it. This is the first time I have ever had a problem with a Dewalt product and I have many."
3,not the best choice,I own 2 of the dewalt DC527 lights and they do not even come close to the craftsman 19.2 fluorrscent. The craftsman last way longer and is a whole lot brighter. One craftsman puts out more light than both of the dewalt lights.I can get 2 nights use from 1 charge on the craftsman and the dewalt lucky to get one hour. I was really disapointed. Bottom line get a Craftsman and be happier
3,"Good light, but...","I have several DeWalt tools and a couple of work lights. Maybe it was the packaging, maybe it was a re-furbished light, but one of the small chips inside the unit fell off and I hadn't even used the light for an hour.I would recommend another of DeWalt's work light units as they are really nice."
3,Good light- when you get some that work. Great customer service for problems.,"I ordered four of these lights along with batteries and chargers. On the first day of use three lights failed within the first thity minutes. Amazon was quick to send replacements and the Dewalt factory was genuinely concerned but puzzled when I spoke to them. All three of the replacements also failed in the same time period with the exact issues. Again, Dewalt was puzzled but put me in touch with a regional representative who quickly and professionally handled the problem and replaced the three lights with units that he tested to verify they did not have the same issue. I'm really pleased with the level of service demonstrated by everyone I dealt with but overall it took way too long to get units that are usable."
4,Great Complilation,"The Source's Fourth volume is very solid. You have some hardcore on this disc all the way to some light weights light Common. There have been source volumes where sometimes you want to skip a track, but not on this one, all these tracks are great. The source does a great job by connecting the songs together, always an extra point when they do that. Would have rather have seen a couple other tracks replace others, but no compilation is perfect. Sill, a very good disc.My top 5:The Light - CommonWobble Wobble - 504 boyzBad Boyz - Shyne & Barrington LevyOhh - De La Soul & RedmanCountry Grammar - Nelly"
2,Melissa &Doug Magnectic chalk dry erase board,The product is a very poor quality. The first week the edge of the board came off. Not recommending it for others.
4,Nice toy,Good value.. you just need a box to hold the magnetic letters and numbers..great for travel..Worth the money!Kids will have loads of fun and not disturb you in restaurants or while flying.cheersJoshmybench
5,Great Gift,The Magnetic Chalk Dry Erase Board was a great hit. The birthday girl loves it. She has fun writing and erasing! Good item for a child learning to write and draw.
2,Disappointed,"Others have noted the skinny chalk that breaks--but the chalkboard side of ours doesn't write well. It might be black, but it's too smooth or the wrong material, and several kinds of chalk I've tried just don't write on it.As others have noted, there's no ledge or anything to hold the chalk and markers; the alphabet doesn't have any duplicates (so no writing ""Sara"" or ""moo""), and the letters aren't painted, but have a colored adhesive on them, which comes off quickly. On the whole the quality is disappointing."
2,Whiteboard sub-par?,"1. Even using the BIC markers rated high for easy erasability, this whiteboard displays previously-erased characters. Makes it very difficult for little ones to focus on new words/shapes drawn on board unless using very dark marker.2. The little wooden magnetic letters are very thin and more of a cardboard consistency - easily chewed by little ones.3. Don't use blue chalk on chalkboard - it doesn't come off very easily."
5,Magnetic Board,"The board has been a pleasant addition to my grandson's learning. He enjoys using the magnetic shapes on the board, and learning the numbers and letters in a fun and creative manner. I recommend the board highly."
3,"Could be better, but it does enough","One thing I do not like about this product is that there is no place to hold chalks/marker and eraser. Also, it would be nice if the letters and numbers stick both side.If your child is three, I do not recommend getting this one yet.(Some three years old might be ready.) Chalk and maker are too much for them (They will probably need a supervision all the time.) Because my son is 4, and still recognition level(enjoy finding the letter indicated), I could have gotten puzzle one instead, but I feel that he would be moving onto the next level soon, so I got this to save money and be prepared as well. I also got other letters (lowser case and uppercase set), so we can spell more words as he gets older. I recommend to observe the child's skill, interest, and consider how much you want to supervise, or be playing together with him/her before you purchase this product."
3,Not what I expected,Expected something a little better especially from Melissa and Doug is thin and just flips over so not a desk by any means no place to keep chalk and materials
3,magnetic chalk board,The idea is fine. I wish there were some way to set up the board for easier use. The quality of Melissa & Doug is very good. This was purchased for a 3 year old.
2,lost manetic after a couple of months,"1. I thought it is a good educational toys, but unfortunately my daughter does not have much interest in it.So if you want your kids to learn to draw on a white board, better directly go to a large easel board intead of a tiny one.2. the letters do not hold on the white board anymore after a couple of months. I guess the magnet wear out?The colorful letter do look cute. I hope later I could use those letters in other way to teach her to spell it."
1,Very disappointed,"We normally love Melissa and Doug products but were very disappointed by the quality of this one. It broke immediately after taking it out of the box. The frame came apart (and couldn't be fixed even with wood glue) and the ""chalkboard"" bubbled up. The chalk also didn't show up very well."
3,Only magnetic on one side,"This is a nice idea, but too small to do anything but cram all the letters on at once, and is only magnetic on the blackboard side (letters won't stick to the white board). Also, my 10 month old daughter immediately put one of the pretty, colorful letters in her mouth and that is how I discovered that the colors are from shiney paper stuck to the wood instead of durable paint - she sucked the color off of the edges within 2 minutes. All that said, you are getting a lot of stuff for $10, and the letters look nice on the fridge (just don't eat them!)."
2,Not the best,"This product comes with wooden alphabet magnets. Mine came with two L's and no K. Annoying, to say the least. Also, the quality of the blackboard is very poor. It's just a sheet of flimsy plastic material. Overall, not an impressive product, which is surprising because I adore all my other Melissa and Doug products and adore the company in general!"
4,Great!,This is my second board....I bought one for my first Grandchild and he loved it so much that I purchased this another one for my third Grandson. He is almost 2 and he loves drawing with both the chalk side and the dry erase side. The letters he uses on my refrigerator and is learning some letters.
3,Misleading: Where's the DVD?,"The preface to this book clearly states that it is part of a package yet none of the listings specifically state that the DVD is not included. It sounds like you're getting a great deal until you get to class, find out you need the video (as I did)and have to buy it from the school bookstore at an outrageous price because you have to have it. Of course after that I started poking around online and the only site I found that sold them separately was the publisher, Signmedia. So I feel that these listings are misleading because even though the ISBN numbers matched, it was not the same product. I would urge anyone that needs these for class to go to the Signmedia website and compare the cost of buying the set from them to the cost of a used book here and a new DVD from there.Hopefully others will benefit from my mistake.P.S. This review is only about the WAY it's listed, the book I bought was in fine shape and is a good product so I have no issues there."
3,american sign language,This book is exactly what I needed. It came on time. The only thing is there were several pages missing out of in in the center of the book. It looked like it has been rebinded so I guess thats what I get huh!
1,Poor quality!,"I regret I bought this Sharp camcorder. I knew Sharp's quality if not very good from my past experience, but I just couldn't resist the low price and $100 rebate. After just about 1 month, it is already dead in water: the power just couldn't be turned on no matter what I tried. The worse part is that I found out the closest authorized service dealer is 300+ miles away from me because it is a ""digital"" camcorder. So, think twice if you want to buy a Sharp camcorder!"
1,qiang wu,"I am a Chinese, in pass the mail order's way in Michigan on March 12, in your place address for purchasing first set SHARP DV, now I already return toing China, but SHARP DV however badly, needing fixing, but I can't again go to the United Statesing, pleasing telling my this problem-solving way? if can mailing you fix, pleasing telling me mailing.Please accept our thanks for the trouble you have taken."
2,No good for Final Cut Pro No S-Video,"Although this camera has analog input it has no S-Video support. So the higher resolution is wasted in some situations. Also this camera does not have video output when there is input from Firewire as in most digitla editing systems. If you want a cheap usable camera, it's okay. If you want to integrate it into a firewire editing system or have an S-Video capable monitor, look elsewhere."
1,Bottom line - Poor video quality.,"I too have been waiting for the price to come down on MiniDV camcorders. So when I saw this deal I thought it was time to upgrade from my old Sony ccd-trv16 8mm. Unlike many other people, the main thing I am looking for in a camcorder is great video quality. I couldn't care less about all the other bells and whistles. I used both video cameras to film the same scenes indoors with all the lights turned on and the shades open (from what I've read MiniDv's need lots of light). To my amazement the 8mm had a much better image. The colors were vibrant on the Sony. The colors on the Sharp VLNZ105U were washed out and the skin tones were greyish. I returned it and will probably look at a higher end Sony. The lesson I learned is that it doesn't matter what format the video is stored (MiniDV, Hi8, 8mm) if the optics are not up to par, you will not get a good image. I guess you get what you pay for."
2,cheap Quality,"the problem with the sword is the handle wich is made from plastic so its too weak to carry the heavy blade , for that you will not be able to swing the sword or to have some fun with it because if you try to do that you may break the handle .after all the sword is not that Quality i hoped for the high price i paid"
1,Doesn't work without 2wire,"I PURCHASED this homelink system from earthlink when I signed up for the DSL line. The DSL connection for the main computer work fine with the home portal system. The additional DSL link LYNKSYS which was supposed to work for the lap top only works through the home portal system. I have been told that the phone wiring in my house is the cause of this problem. Also, since the outside wiring works, I cannot return the LYNKSYS and get a refund of my $150.I was told to hire an electrician to make sure my inside phone wiring works. I mentioned that it works just fine for phones so I had no reason to question its adequacy. Too bad!!!"
1,A waste of money,"I am sorry I have never read these reviews before it would have saved me money, time and effort. I connected it as explained and it worked for about 6 months. I then had a hard drive crash and had to replace the hard drive. Now when I try to hook it up the USB recognizes that I have an unknown piece of hardware but won't recognize it as the Linksys Phoneline adapter. If I unplug the USB cord and plug it back in it will then recognize it until I reboot and have to go through the unplugging and replugging again. Since it worked before with the same computer it has to be that this product is made poorly and will not last. I now have several hundred dollars in a router, two internal phone cards, a USB adapter and no network. I will never purchase another Linksys product. I gave it one star since that is the lowest available."
1,Great for low amperage units like a Dremmel.,This little unit can handle a Dremmel or Fordom.Do NOT try to use it on belt sanders and/or bench grinders.This overheated and melted the bottom of my sneakers.
5,Great item,"I got this to use as the foot pedal in an old 1920's sewing machine. The connection that the machine came with was impossible to find on a modern foot pedal so I cut it all off and wired it so that it would connect to this. Now I have a great heavy duty pedal that works like a charm, couldn't ask for more. I'm sure over time I will find even more uses for this."
2,Doesn't match up to dremel tool,I received the item quickly and gave it to my wife as one of her Christmas gifts to be used with a dremel tool she already has. When she went to plug it in the plug would not fit onto the dremel tool because one of the metal pieces on the plug of the dremel tool was bigger than the other and is not made to fit this foot pedal. I would have had no problem with this but in the description for the foot pedal it states it can be used with the dremel tool and it actually isn't. Just to let you know if you plan to buy it for a dremel tool.
3,Got what I paid for. Sort of,Upon receiving this product I had to try it out. Worked perfectly for about fore or five tries. then I heard a peace of metel snap in side. So I had to pull it apart to see if it was something easy to fix. Upon opening I found that the metel pull back contact plate had snapped. Upont locating a piece of 22 g steal. I formed a new piece and it works better then before. Its a good and sturdy peace except that one part.
1,Started on fire not to be used with a heavy draw,"Purchased these a while back to use with slow speed overhead drilling with DEWALT DWD220 1/2-Inch VSR Pistol Grip Drill with E-Clutch Anti-Lock Control . After drilling about 15 - 3/8"" holes the pedals started on fire. Probably a good pedal for a hobbyist but they are not going to hold up to a constant draw. Unfortunately I bough these well in advance to the start of the project and I am now stuck with them. Keep a fire extinguisher handy!"
5,"Moto Tool ""Rescue""",I have had a single speed Moto Tool and it has not been useful on my wood carving because it was too fast and tended to burn the surface. This speed control makes the tool useful by effectively controlling the speed for a multitude of carving tasks.
5,Interesting and enjoyable mystery,The Monk who vanished is a mystery set in 6-7th century Ireland. It is very detailed and brings the reader easily to this ancient time without sounding like a history or anthropology lesson. The mystery stroy is very well developed and has unexpected twists and turns that are justified and well put together.
2,Solutions Manual of '96 has many errors,"We found many, many typos and numerical errors in the solutions manual. It almost pays to work the problems yourself and generate your own numbers, because chances are that only 3 out of every 4 solutions in this manual are correct. Also, the way the solutions are presented is often confusing, and only numerical *answers* are given for the second set of problems...and even those aren't reliable. Needs revision."
4,Different Drills,"We all have our drills we like to run, but when you get a book like this, it helps you restructure your old drills and gives you a good look at some new ones."
2,Well written but plot is often unbelievable,"This novel starts of with an promising concept and interesting characters. The plot starts to develop nicely, and the characters are interesting. However, the plot rapidly loses credibility. I found this a somewhat pleasant and easy read, but it did not live up to my expectation overall."
4,Haier portable washer,I bought this machine for an aunt who is 86 and was washing on her hands. She loves it. Great for small loads. Doesn't take up much space.
1,I will NEVER purchase anything from Haier again,"I bought this washer and never worked properly from the get go. Customer service had long waits and finally they told me to fix it myself--and the repair visit would cost more than the machine. It just kept filling up with water and rinsing over and over. And yet still the soap never came out of my clothes. I had to constantly baby-sit it, which made it more work than walking to the laundrymat. I finally just threw the thing out after a few months. I later bought a Haier microwave because it was on sale, and it stopped working in one month. I have learned my lesson."
1,VERY LOUD!!!!,"We purchased this from Walmart, and are very dissapointed with the quality. From the second you turn it on, and for about 5-10 minutes initially, and then repeatedly as it goes through the cycles, it is very loud. It is so loud, I am returning it as it will disturb my neighbors in the apartment above us. It sounds like a miniature jackhammer if you can imagine! Waste your money and buy one for yourself, but make sure you hold on to the receipt and packaging! You will need them!"
1,Doesn't work,"We got this washer and it came broken, in won't fill in with water. We called customer service, now we have to wait for another week for their visit... I wish I didn't buy it."
5,Great Washer for Small Apartment,"When you live in a small apartment with no washer in the apartment, washing clothes can get expensive. This little clothes washer is worth the price. I wash a few clothes every few days and hang them to dry and I am saving so much money a year. I figure close to $700 dollars. Paying for the machine in less than a year."
2,Poor Quality Control,The first one they sent leaked. J&R kindly took that one back. The second one made an unholy noise during the wash and rinse cycles and required a service call. Repair guy said motor was installed too low. Hoping to start getting some use out of it now.
1,Infernal machine backed up by useless customer service,"A host of problems plague this machine, from missing parts upon shipment to tiny unusable handles to a leaking intake hose. Combine this with the worst customer service phone support since UHaul (you will wait on hold for at least 20 minutes, only to be told that they can't help you and you should call a service technician which, of course, costs more money than you paid for the machine in the first place) and this is one purchase you would be wise to avoid.You would be better off with a wooden bucket and a washboard. Seriously."
1,"No more Haier, Bad Quality, Bad Customer Service","I have another type of Haier Washer, It was already a little more than a year old, it worked fine until one day it smoked from inside the machine. One electric unit burned and melt the water resistance plastic barrier. We are lucky we found it right away, no fire happened. Hope you have the same luck too.On the other side, don't count on their customer service, I contact both HaierUSA and Haier China headquarter more than a week ago, HaierUSA never reply me, Haier Headquarter no resolution either.Then after half month, they said they can provide the part, but the labour fee will cost a new wahser.No more Haier."
1,JUNK!,This thing broke down after a couple of loads. it's not worth to spend your time and money on this kind of junk.
1,Good or Bad product??,"I am conflicted about buying this product because the reviews are very disparate. I can't help but wonder if the great reviews are planted by company PR/Sales staff. From what I've heard, many companies and organizations post made up comments or reviews to fit their desired outcomes and influence opinions. Any thoughts about this?"
4,Great product for the price,I've been using the HLP21E for the last month and it's been working great. You just need to make sure that you don't overload the machine. I recommend it for anyone looking for an easy alternative lightweight machine.
5,It's OK if you can ever get it to turn on,"This little machine washes great. The problem is the push plastic on top, which you have to stand and push overr and over before it will start, at least on mine. I think there is a loose something, will get my son to look at it.I got this free from Craigslist as that owner wanted a larger machine for her family. Had to experiment with how much detergent to put in. If you are using the concentrated detergent, a quarter cup( the one on thethe bottle, not the cup you cook with) of detergent will be enough, I kid you not. The first few times had to rinse over again using white distilled vinegar to remove all the residue. Like this machine, especially free!"
1,Recommendation: Buy anthing but Haier!,"I recommend never owning a Haier product. I was lured into purchasing two different Haier products, and found the same problems with both: sub-standard functioning, terrible instructions, lacking customer service. In the end of it all, both products failed me so I am out hundreds of dollars and HOURS of my life spent on the phone with their rude and not helpful customer service representatives.In the end, I spent more on the Haier products than I would have on a name brand, having to purchase equipment to do repairs myself (they have almost NO repair centers in the US), and having to pay shipping to get exchanges, which also did not work. Wouldn't you think they would guarantee their products enough not to make customers pay $15 per exchange for their mistakes?Anyway, save yourself time, money and stress. Buy something else."
3,promisd delivery,okay for the price as extra washer ;good for water saving consumer who need a quick and small wash but it is noisy. delivery of it was set but delivered before then without a prior notice.
4,I like it,"I live in an apartment, and I needed to buy small washer to wash my underwears and t-shirts. And this model is perfect to use and it is not that noisy, so sometimes I use it at night."
3,"Convenient, but with some problems","Getting one of these for our apartment was great. No more running out in the cold just to wash some work clothes. The setup was a breeze (although, there was a bit of a mishap on my part when I didn't tighten one of the connections tightly enough, thus spraying water on myself, my unsuspecting girlfriend, and a very shocked pair of cats.Our kitchen floor is pretty unbalanced, so we're unable to do anything larger than a medium load without the machine making a horrendous churning sound.If you live in an apartment and are tired of always having to set aside every quarter you come across, get this product."
4,"Don't be scared, it is the Bottom plate!","I've read about that loud hammering sound here a lot. Unfortunately, just today, two days after I tried mine. I had the same problem and I was almost scared! It is the bottom plate!. Install it with concave side facing to the floor! Manual is useless telling it which side! Also, make sure to use some faucet wrench to install that faucet adapter, otherwise you'll definitely get wet! Aslo, keep the hoses up after you're done since it still have water in them. After this horrifying start, now mine works well."
4,good machine and useless manual,"I reviewed most comments before my decision to purchase such minimachine. As I received it, I installed the parts according to the manual. However,it didn't tell anything. Frankly, the installation is easy except the bottom panel. I didn't know which side should face up. OK,I tried the convexity upside firstly. When everything was set up, I turned on the machine. Oh,man!I was shocked by the terrible sound like a jack hammer.I doubted the installation I did. I inversed the bottom panel to make the concave upside. Then, it's solved!Everything worked fine. No leak, no terrible sound,clothes coming out clean and just damp. I don't worry about the dirty public laundry anymore.The complaint is about the useless manual. It wasted my time. That's why I just rate it with 4 stars, although I'm satified with the washing machine itself so far."
4,This Is Really Hoggin' The Stage,There are so many live Groundhogs releases out there that it's starting to get a little redundant even for a hardcore fan. This is just another re-issue of the Hoggin' The Stage live anthology that was released originally in 1984 I believe; and it's still one of their best live releases. However the re-mastering here is superior making it a worthwhile purchase if you only have that one on vinyl.I believe they did trim a few tracks to make this fit on a single disc though.
1,Scratches bottles,"This brush is too big to fit into bottles, dr. brown, evenflo, medela! I don't know which bottles it fits into. Also, bristles are too hard and scratched the plastics bottles that we have. Had to throw them out. The soap sprays everywhere when trying to remove the brush from the bottles. All in all, useless brush."
2,Not for breastshields,The brush is stiff and I feel I have to force it in the bottle. The bottles I use are the 5oz medela and the evenflo glass bottles.I also feel like it doesn't generate a lot of suds. I definitely cannot use to clean the medela breastshield. The brush is too stiffto fit inside and clean it throughly.
2,Rust,"I bought several of these brushes because we go through them left and right. Afer 10 months of using them...I have decided that I do not like them...at all. The nipple brush uses a metal wire...which rusts after about a month or so. The lengh of the brush is just a little too short. To wash an 8oz bottle is a little difficult because once the brush is fully in, there is only about 1-1 1/2 inches of the handle to hold on to in order to clean the bottle. Even with having smaller hands...this makes it hard to twist and clean. If you put the nipple brush back in and try to twist it...it doesn't work because the nipple brush doesn't ""lock""."
3,Does Not Fit Dr. Browns Bottles,"This brush seemed to do a pretty thorough cleaning, it simply does not fit the standard size Dr. Browns bottles without a fight to push it in . It was most hard with the glass bottles, with the other material Dr. Browns it was only a tiny bit easier.The bristles are very hard and get even harder over time. We trashed the brush but kept the nipple cleaner because it does a very good job. It does, however, rust within a few months."
2,Decent Brush,"This brush is huge. The size is a positive because it cleans the whole surface of the bottle. However, when you pull it out of the bottle the bristles cause soap to splatter everywhere. The bristles are very rough so it does scratch the bottles.The nipple bristles are firm enough to clean well. I also like that the nipple brush is longer than the recent nipple brushes I have seen. The suction does work well. One major negative about the nipple brush is the wire that it is made out of is rusting at the tip.I would not purchase again."
1,Doesn't fit into Dr Brown bottles and bristles are too stiff,"the subject pretty says it all, but this brush doesn't fit into the opening of Dr Brown's bottles and is too short to reach the bottom of an 8 ounce bottle anyway. and the bristles are so stiff that they hurt my hands. and the nipple brush hardly has enough bristles to clean a nipple. poor quality, poorly designed."
2,"Just OK brush, nipple brush getting rust","The bottle brush is OK. It doesn't scratch, but when you pull it out of the bottle the bristle sprinkle water/soap everywhere. My sleeves were always wet after cleaning. I definitely prefer the Avent brush. It's softer and has bristles on one side that helps to avoid the sprinkling.The nipple brush is OK. There really needs to be more bristles though. And now, after only 5 months of use, the tip of the nipple brush is starting to rust."
4,Very useful for bottles!,At first it seemed this brush wasn't too great since the bristles were too hard and I found it difficult to use on narrow mouthed bottles. But after a few uses the bristles became flexible and the brush worked great for all kinds of bottles! I really like that you can stand this brush on the counter top/sink without worrying about getting it dirty. I don't use the small brush at the bottom much and am not sure how it would work for small parts...hence the 4 stars.
3,Overall pretty good...but wont buy again..,"When my mom bought this it looked really great and sturdy, which it is. The smaller brush is great and I still use it, but the larger one worked great for the first month maybe...then the bristles got scrunched up and wouldnt clean the corners at the bottom of the bottles, leaving the white residue. So I bout a new brush. I still use it to clean the tops of the bottles though. It is a very sturdy choice though, my new brush already broke :-)"
2,Terrible for plastic but good for glass,"This bottle brush has extremely rough bristles!It scratches up the insides of every plastic bottle I tried it on (including Born Free, Dr.Brown's and Avent).The bristles are so stiff that when you pull the brush out of the bottle neck, it sprays water in a mist everywhere, even with the wide neck bottles.Because the bristles don't hold soap like typical sponge material, I have to reapply soap often.If you use glass bottles, it won't scratch obviously, so this is an okay choice if you don't mind the spray."
2,doesn't fit in Dr. Brown's bottles,"This brush does not fit inside Dr. Browns bottles. It fits in Avent bottles and does a good job, but since I use both Avent and Dr. Browns bottles it isn't ideal. I just wish it were a bit smaller so it fit in Dr. Browns."
3,Cleans Your Bottles,"This brush works well enough. I find it to be a little big for the Medela bottles, I'm always fighting to pull it out of the bottle. But it gets them clean, which is the important thing."
3,Nice brush-but has flaws,"I loved this brush at first, had it about a week. Then the suction part detached from the nipple brush and wont go back. I am going to try and super glue it and hopefully it will then stay. Otherwise nice brush. And yes the bottle brush should be a bit more narrow so the foam doesn't spray everywhere when you remove it from the bottle. But it works perfect for cleaning and is better on cups and larger mouthed bottles."
2,Jammed thumb,"I bought this brush because I feel like I'm constantly trying to figure out how to get my breastmilk bottles free of the milky slim (and smell). At first I didn't think it would even fit in my 5-oz Medela breastpump bottles. It fits. Sort of. But each time I used it I banged up my thumb. Finally I jammed the thumb against the bottle so badly that I couldn't sleep and set up holding ice on my finger half the night. That was a month ago and my finger still hasn't fully recovered. I no longer use this bottle brush. But it did work really well on the bottle, which is why it got more than 1 star. I'm back in the market to find something new. Maybe a cleaning solution to soak?"
1,useless,Very disappointing purchase. The head is too big and doesn't fit in small bottles and the bristles are too hard and squirted everywhere when I used it. The small brush is a little better but the big one is absolutely unusable.
2,Too stiff,"I just replaced my OXO bottle brush with this one, but I like the OXO much better. This one is very stiff, so much so that it is difficult to shove the brush inside the bottle, and pulling it out sprays soap and water all over my counter. I would not buy this again... I'm definitely going back to the OXO next time."
2,Too big for Dr. Browns,Pros:1.Sturdy2.Suction keeps it off the counter3.No sponge for germ collectionCons:1. Too large for Dr.Browns standard bottles2. The nipple attachment is too rough
5,Great Brush,"Granted you can buy this cheaper in the store, but I find that this is a great brush. I love the fact that it stands up right with a suction cup. That it comes apart with a hidden nipple brush that stays nice an clean. The brush works great on a variety of bottles. I have had no problems with it. I mean, why spend more than 5.00 for a bottle brush?"
2,Mold on suction holder,"I like the design of the brush, but the suction part that sticks to the counter or wherever developed some sort of mold. I tried to bleach it and it did nothing to improve the condition of the plastic. If you aren't expecting to use this brush for longer than a month or two, it's fine, otherwise it's a little creepy. I've had mine about a year, but it got the mold after a few months. It stayed on the counter top where there was water but water only. The nipple brush does rust as well. It's too bad because the brush works well."
2,Doesn't Clean Breast Milk Well,"I guess I should have gotten one of those brushes with the sponge at the end because this brush does not completely clean my bottles or nipples. Unlike formula, breastmilk has water resistant fat in it, which this brush does not always clean off. The bristles are too course to clean the bottle and nipples effectively and I end up using a paper towel WITH the handle of the brush to make sure it is fully clean. Also the bristles are so stiff that every time I take the brush out of the bottle, I get soapy suds sprayed all over me! The tip of the nipple brush rusted right away too. I like that the big brush has no metal to rust, so I gave it 2 stars, but I hardly use the big brush besides using the handle to reach down to the bottom of the bottle with my paper towel."
1,Terrible design,"This brush doesn't fit most bottles, you have to push very hard to make it fit, when you pull it out it splashes soap everywhere. The rubber on little brush falls off easily. Don't recommend this brush. It's a terrible design and expensive."
2,Too hard,I think it's too hard for plastic bottles. I was afraid it would make scars on bottles so stopped using it...
2,Can't reach the bottom corner,"When you use this brush to clean baby's bottles, the first thing that you may notice is that it is very hard to put it into the bottle. You need to push hard in order to do it. Then, the second thing that you may notice is, you can't clean the bottle's bottom corner due to its shape. Its round brush head can not reach that area at all. For these reasons, I will only give this product one-star.The only good thing about this brush is it can stand by itself very well. So you don't need to worry that it will touch any dirty things after you wash it. I give an extra credit for this design."
2,"Munchkin Bottle Brush is great, Nipple is terrible","The bottle brush works great, however the nipple brush has a bent metal portion that rusted after it was sitting in water overnight. I realize perhaps I should not have had it in water overnight, however it seems to me that anything made to get wet should not rust. I threw this out next day and bought a cheap plastic brand that will not rust."
2,Doesn't fit through bottles easily,I actually don't like this brush and I'm going to purchase a different 1. The bristles are so stiff that it is very difficult to push it through the bottle (I use Dr. Brown's) and when you pull the brush OUT of the bottle soap suds splatter EVERYWHERE b/c they're flung by the stiff bristles. I like the idea of the nipple brush incorporated into the brush itself though.
4,I like the other Munchkin better,One of the good things about this brush is that it can stand on its handle. That means you can avoid the bristles from touching the dirty kitchen counter or worse rolling to the floor.It is sturdier than their other bottle brush because there is no foam at the tip that can get detached. But it is the same reason why I prefer the other cheaper Munchkin product. The foam at the end helps to clean the bottom of the bottle much better. This one is all bristlesAlso the handle is almost at the middle which gets in the way when brushing the taller bottles. The handle scratches the mouth of the bottle.
2,STIFF bristles can't clean pump parts,"The colored bristles on this brush are so stiff that it's unworkable for cleaning Medela pumping pieces or even the Medela bottles -- you can't get it into most of the crevices of your pumping parts or the flanges, and although you can shove hard and get it into the bottles, when you pull it out you get splattered with water and soap."
3,Eh not bad but not great,"I originally had the Munchkin bottle brush that had a sponge on top but that didn't last very long because the sponge fell apart.I bought this one because I was looking for something that was more sturdy and would last longer.Two complaints:1. The brush is very stiff so it's hard to get in and out of the bottles (Ameda bottles) and it definitely doesn't fit into Snappies bottles. You have to force it into the bottles and it usually sprays you when you take it out. (For the record, it fits Avent bottles better).2. It doesn't really hold the soap well. Since its not like a sponge, the soap basically falls off when you squirt it on so I feel like I have to use a lot of soap to get the bottles clean.Overall, it is a lot more sturdy than the previous bottle brush I had, which is what I was looking for and the price is great since its an add-on item."
1,It takes a little push to get it in the bottle,"This brush has hard bristles; prepare to give it a ""good push"" to get it inside the bottle. I just figured that out after I wrote a bad review. Now I'm editing it to say: yes, it does work but it's too hard. I guess if you forgot to hit the gym just try to clean your bottles with this baby."
5,best brush,"I have tried many brushes, but this is definately the best. It is sturdy, durable and has outlasted and outperformed all others. And to those complaining about the splackback. Seriously? Hold the brush and item under the water when you remove it. It doesn't matter what kind of brush you using to wash bottles. Splashback above the water is inevitable."
4,Works and fits my medela bottles....,"The product is works and fits into medela bottles just fine. I've tried using the non-scratch brushes but its impossible to actually get them in the bottle. The little suction cup on the bottom works fine to store in upright between washes. Just rememeber, you should boil everything about once a week."
2,Do not purchase for 4 oz. bottles,"This brush is too thick to fit into the 5 oz. Medela bottles we have, as well as most of the standard bottles for newborns."
5,Good value,"I love this brand and appreciate the suction cup base and how it stores the nipple brush, very handy in the kitchen"
2,Too stiff,"This bottle brush has bristles that are so stiff, it is hard to use. I like the design and the way it stands on the counter, but functionally it isn't very good. I ended up replacing it with theOXO Tot Bottle Brush with Nipple Cleaner and Stand, Orange, which has soft bristles and really cleans well without tiring me out."
1,Bristles are too stiff,"The bottle bristles are too stiff to fit into any bottle. It is also useless when trying to clean pump parts (again, because the bristles are too stiff)."
2,Nipple brush rusted after one month,I have found that I don't care to take the little nipple brush out of the end of the botttle brush each use. But more importantly this is the first bottle brush after three children that has ever rusted on me. And it did so in less than one month from purchase. No more munchkin brushes for me.
2,small brush is too hard!,"I bought this solely for the nipple brush since I couldn't find one sold by itself easily. I think the nipple brush is unusable. The bristles are so hard and sharp I'm not willing to use it on the nipples because it might damage them. In fact, I think I see scratches on the pump parts that I've cleaned it with. You can see in the picture the bristles don't go all the way to the top which also reduces its usefulness."
2,color,"again the color shown is blue,i ordered and i received a pink one.dissatisfied again because i have a boy.give customers the option to choose their color"
1,HUGE and VERY STIFF,This brush sucks! It is HUGE and VERY STIFF...a total waste of money. Really disappointed at Munchkin for the design and at Amazon for selling it without an adequate description.
1,Wrong Color,"THe product display was blue, but on arrival the product was Pink.Can this be corrected. We havea baby boy and don't need pink products"
3,Midwest Product - World Series Of Love,"Midwest Product's mini-album, ""WORLD SERIES OF LOVE,"" adds a new instrument to the mix: vocals. From the angsty ravings on ""Dead Cat"" to the cool (and oddly humorous) 80s drone on ""Bank"" that would give Ladytron a run for their money, Midwest Product seems to be reaching for indie crossover--even though that's probably not their intention. On the instrumental tracks, ""Swamp"" sounds as if it could have come off of SPECIFICS, while ""Avant Poop"" goes for a more aggressive, distorted bass, and ""Duckpond,"" mixes electronic atmospherics with art-rock. The chorus on ""Motivator"" seems a bit out of place to me, but ""Umbrella"" closes the album on a quiet, ambient note. Not as cohesive as SPECIFICS, I'm afraid."
5,Useful and Accurate,"This is a thorough and useful book. In a day when our freedoms are being eroded steadily, it's nice to see a book that puts students' legal rights back into their hands."
5,ADDICTIVE FUN,"This awesome product is absolutely addictive and FUN. Great for all ages-- my three kids aged 7-13 all LOVE this product, as well as my 74 year old father! I don't ever remember seeing a ""toy"" product with that kind of appeal."
1,dont buy this,dum and waste of money Ithink it must be a scam toy of the year thats a laugh it right up there with pet rock
2,Only works on Windows XP and older versions of Outlook and Outlook Express,"Folks running Outlook 2007 or newer do not need the product as the ability to divide messages already exists within Outlook 2007 and 2010. What Ella does is to allow the user to separate e-mail into categories. For example, if you want to divide your inbox into two categories such as INBOX and NEWS, Ella manages this by ""memorizing"" e-mail types from examples that you supply. It is a very easy program to use. But, it sometimes causes Outlook to crash. Best solution, in my view, is to use a newer version of MS Office. I have never tried this program with Outlook Express for which it was designed."
2,Huffing and puffing,"This pump comes at a premium cost, with subpar performance. It takes forever to pump a mountain tire to 60psi... and that's if the gauge even works. Right out of the box the gauge was reading 15lbs. I sent it back. A few weeks later a new one arrived in seemingly good condition... until it got knocked over a few times. Then the gauge went haywire again.I love tools made by Park, but I will never buy another pump from them."
3,disappointed,"I've used inexpensive bicycle pumps for years, and they have worked reasonably well. I thought I would treat myself to a ""shop quality"" Park pump last year. It comes at a premium price and I expected better. It requires twice as many strokes to inflate my tires, and much more pumping effort. I have only used it at home for my own bicycle, and the pump head has broken after only 8 months of use. I'm disappointed"
1,simple minded,"if you've heard his radio show, you know how annoying and predictable and boring rusty is. how he got syndicated, i'll never know. the c.d. is only slightly better than his talk show.david"
5,rusty humphries is flat out funny,"If you're a patriotic American or you just have a sense of humor, Rusty Humphries""Bomb Iraq"" is just a gutbuster. It's political satire set to a cool 60's and classic rock sound, but with clever edgy lyrics that are not politically correct in the least. Like the song that looks at life as a ""Teenager in Palestine"" set to the classic ""Teenager in Love."" Or ""Osama Bin Laden"" to the music of ""La Bamba."" Illegal aliens also get a going over in an irreverant way. This cd won't turn a peace protester into a republican but it will make you laugh. Offensive in the best sense of the word, in a warped Dr. Demento way, but with good harmonies and strong vocals from the national Radio Talk show host. Sean Penn and the Hollywood idiots will hate this CD, but for a humorous look at a scary world ""Bomb Iraq"" is the bomb."
2,ouch!,"not quite on key, my ears are still stinging a bit. i don't think he'd make it on american idol. ha ha...... still, 2 stars for the effort."
3,A mixed bag of fruits,"It's tough to rate this book. On one end, you get alot of web technologies in one package: xhtml, javascript, xml, asp.net, php, python, sql, etc, etc. On the other end, however, some sections are severely lacking. The PHP section is very short and topics such as PHP classes aren't even mentioned. The main problem with this book is that it's trying to create something that is just too ambitious. There are many commands, for every scripting language I mentioned above, that are missing. IMHO, I think the Deitels are good authors. Their C++ series is phenomenal and it really taught me how to program in C++. This book, while it does contain the great writing style of Deitels, is unfortunately incomplete in too many aspects.If you want to learn a scripting language, then it would be a good idea to purchase a book which focuses on that language alone and not 10,000 others at once."
2,you won't learn much here,The book wants to cover too many argumenets and the result is very disappointing. It's not fluent and there are too many mistakes. My worst book so far.
4,Excellent for any programming leve,"This is an excellent book. A lot of examples which help you to understand the topics. If you want to learn the fundation of JavaScript, this book has four chapters about this topic. It covers diffenrent type of databases.Sometimes, it jumps (or reference) to other chapter. In general, it is an excellent book."
4,Some of My Best Friends Are DJ's,"If your looking for something different then this is a must have CD. Its a combination of well, all sorts - a sort of raw mixed funky jazz flavour - I think!By far my favorite track on the CD is Skanky Panky, with a sort of really heavy Ska-style bass rythm and twisted trumpet effects its deffinately a must-listen. Unfortunately not all the tracks do it for me, infact only a couple do, and its a bit short at just 35:07.However, as far as 'something different' goes, this is a must have album and it has a certain honesty that many superstar DJ albums don't have, a sort of charming neivety, almost as if you are in the room having a laugh with the DJ himself. Try it, it can't hurt!"
5,Dr. Delman has met a critical need,"Dr. Ivan Delman has written a comprehensive guide to life after opening one's practice. In this perilous time of both ever expanding responsibility and shrinking resources for health care providers, Dr. Delman has provided a resource that could significantly improve the bottom line, while maintaining extremely high ethical standards, for any health care provider who follows his advice. I heartily recommend this book to anyone who is interested in a successful and enjoyable practice experience."
3,Wasnt Really Feelin It,"The first couple of times I listened to this CD I wasn't really feeling Sparkle, but I kept saying to myself R.Kelly is behind this...keep listening. And when I decided to listen to myself I wasnt really impressed with the results. Sparkle deals with too much drama! Is there one song on this CD where she discusses love--not a breakup or a let down?"
5,"I LOVE WHAT ABOUT MORE THAN ANY SONG, ITS A SONG THAT MAKES",SPARKLE IS MY #1 FAN I LOVE ALL OF HER SONGS. SHE'S A REALLY GOOD SINGER. I'LL LOVE TO MEET HER ONE DAY TO JUST LISTEN TO HOW SHE SINGS WELL IN PERSON.
3,Pretty good album; Sparkle has potential,"This is an album for true R&B fans only!! ""Be Careful"" is one of the better tracks on the album, but there's more good songs. I believe Sparkle definitely deserves more recognition from the media; perhaps the next album will accomplish that for her. Great voice, girl. Keep trying."
1,Superficial & biased overview of German foreign policy,"This is a most disappointing book on German foreign policy before the war. With a blatant bias against the Germans (all German sources and researches are dubious and suspect, all French, British and especially American works are treated as Gospel)and little primary researches, Weinberg just regurgitates all the incredulous, slanderous post war crap about NS Germany."
5,Read and perform this play!,"What a wonderful play! This play is set in Russia and is about the transformation of Pelagea Vlassova, an illiterate, somewhat narrow and worn, older woman. She starts out suspicious of her son's new friends -- a group of young Bolsheviks who make leaflets in her home! They endanger, she feels, her already precarious and poverty stricken existence. But as she questions and observes these youth she is drawn into the revolution and comes alive, changing into a badass revolutionary herself: creative, daring and courageous. Music and song accompany her transformation -- and the fourth wall is broken many times as the actors take turns talking frankly to the audience about the story as it unfolds."
3,Norpro Fry Cutter,"The machine does what it somewhat advertises, it is a bit flimsy an waiting for it to snap on a hard potato. However my main drawback with this machine is that it said it made shoestring fries, which it doesnt . It makes only reg fries an bigger fries . Otherwise a good deal ."
3,Okay at First,It takes a great deal of elbow grease to cut a medium sized Russet Potatoe but cuts a perfect french fry. Around the twentieth pototoe the stainless steel cutter screen bent and so did the metal slide arm. It can't be fixed so I just tossed it.
5,Works very well.,Takes a little muscle for a larger potato. I especially like the apple corer attachment
2,dissapointed,"Owned this product approximately 3 months. Cut fries pretty well when the blades weren't bending.I even cut the ends off the potatoe to reduce starting strain and went through 2,1/2"" and 2,1/4"" blades in 3 months using 1 or 2 a week.The positives are i still can cut apples, it does cut apples well so far."
2,It needs powerful man to work with,1- It requires much power to slice something2- Big apples cannot be cut by the apple cutter because it has small diameter
2,Ugh,I have arthritis in my fingers and find it impossible to operate. You must exercise A LOT of pressure to push the potato out.
1,cutter,"hard to cut even apples potatoes pull it away from the counter,the suction doesnt hold tight enough and have to have thin plate to catch things that are cut basicly dont like it"
2,Beware of shattering,"We bought four of these rocks glasses, as well as four of the highball version. They look great, feel superb in the hand, and are more substantial than any I've seen. However-- three of the four rocks glasses spontaneously have suddenly developed a crack ringing the glass, evidently from the temperature difference between the top and bottom of the glass. In one instance, I poured in room-temperature water after finishing a bourbon on the rocks, and the top and bottom halves separated. Other times, there was a crack but the glass didn't fall apart. A shame-- these are splendid, and in comparison the rocks glasses I just bought (by Schott Zwiesel) look and feel cheap. (The highball glasses have not had the same problem, perhaps because there is less cold-retaining mass in the bass, and I can recommend them.)"
1,Disappointing,"I bought this phone on July 22, 2006 and was happy for about the first 3-4 months. Then the quality of the calls dropped significantly until in February 2007 the phone broke completely. I would not recommend this refurbished phone to anyone after this experience."
2,Not as good as I hoped,"I took a chance on buying this cd because of the rave reviews. Out of 44 songs, only about 14 songs made my list. If you are a child from the 50's, 60's or maybe early 70's, then this cd is for you. I will stick with the love songs from the 80's."
3,"Breezy, Relaxing, and Fun","An interesting mixed bag of alternative rock, quirky pop, and an overtone of bossa nova and jazz all throughout, especially in the title track. Very fun listening, if a bit too sleepy at times. Worth listening to but not nearly as great as his followup album Friendly Fire.It was a shame that so many people focused on his last name instead of the musical content when this album came out. It became ridiculous and downright stupid at times. You can see a lot of that showcased here on Amazon in some of the stupid reviews written (both positive and negative). Ah, there are some good reviews here too of course. But at any rate, don't let all that distract you from this little nugget, Into The Sun. And Friendly Fire is definitely not to be missed, as it is one of the greats."
3,At best the album is half baked!,"Sean Lennon seems to have more in common with Paul McCartney's solo efforts than his dads...the ballads are syrupy and weak...the best track is Home....Sean would do better to let his guitar whirl a little more....the opening track, Home, and Queu are the best tracks but they stand in poor company...Sean has potential, and call me crazy, but maybe he should colloborate with his half brother, Julian, whose last album was a mature effort. A good if not great album!"
2,Hard to live up to Dad,Considering that John Lennon had THE greatest voice in rock history (in my humble opinion) the young Sean pales by comparison. Unlike brother Julien he was blessed with more of Yoko's vocal genes than his father's. While the songwriting is interesting it seems to lack any real passion although the production sounds more classic than modern. It might make good background music if you can get past the vocal sound.
3,"Not quite 'fab', but not too bad","""Into The Sun"" is an interesting album, you've got to give Lennon that at least. Every track is a take on a different genre of music and they're all done pretty well. The highlight, I think, is ""Home"", which is a brilliant song and eerily like one of his father's, but the rest aren't shabby either.Only two real complaints: 1) The album is mildly boring. A lot of the songs are quiet and slow, which is not necessarily bad... but on this album it leaves you wishing there was a bit more punch. 2) Like I already said, every song is from a different genre, and while this makes for an interesting and eclectic mix, it leaves you longing for cohesiveness.Overall though, this album is quite enjoyable, and at the very least it's made me curious to see how Sean Lennon will develop his style for his next album, whenever that'll be."
3,Cool debut CD...But what happened?,"Sean Lennon, nice debut CD. Great opening song, good lyrics, very original album! A PROMISING young artist...back in 1998! It's been nearly SEVEN years now since this has come out, so what the heck is going on? Is Sean retired or what? I mean the typical two year cycle for artists is a drag in my opinion...three or even four years can be tolerated at times (If you're Tool)...but geez, SEVEN YEARS with no sign of any work in progress? A big letdown for those of us who liked this album and looked forward to more material from this promising young artist. Now he's a thirty something who has seemingly abandoned the world of music...unfortunate. He quit before he could truly prove himself to the world, when many fans wanted him to at least try. And again, I will strongly say this is a fabulous debut appreciated by most critics, which makes this whole thing even more hard to understand. Sorry I just had to vent..."
1,Into the Sun-Sean Lennon,Just as I expected-Sean got his non-talent from Yoko. What a piece of trash. The Lennon talent definitely was given to Julian. Sean should take up another hobby. I had to give it 1 star because there was no 0
1,Wrong side of the gene pool!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Sean sings like Yoko. To quote another reviewer, ""Leave the music to Julian,"" PLEASE! Does any more need to be said?"
2,Expected alot more,"I bought this album based on a review and snippets on NPR. When I got the album and listened to it, I haven't yet been able to find any redeeming qualities - good melody hooks, lyrics that connect (like you get with Julian Lennon). There is a track or two that I like, but its just not worth wading through the rest of the songs. I hope his next effort is better."
1,Sean Can't Sing!,"This album is virtually unlistenable...if you like Hip hop or 90's music, I'm sure that you could find much better places than a guy who inherited from his Dad only the name, and from his Mom, his vocals....I hope there are no more albums in the works...I'm giving away my copy to my brother who actually likes it...."
5,Sean is coooooool,"I have loved this disc since it came out. My friend told me I should listen to the Beatles, the group that Sean's dad was in, to hear where Sean got his influences and I have to say something that a lot of people are thinking but not saying. Sean's music is better than the Beatles. I like the Beatles but I think that Sean is a better songwriter than his dad. ""Mean Mr. Mustard"" is a good song, but ""Into the Sun"" is better. I think that Ringo could sing better than Sean, but Sean's knowledge of hip-hop is something that could have made the Beatles a better group. The Beatles just don't have a groove. Their message, Peace, love. etc., was good. I think that Sean can take it further than them. He's kind of like Lenny Kravitz. Paul Mcartney said that all we need is love but Lenny said we should ""Let Love Rule."" I think that Lenny says it in a way that people can understand. Lenny and Sean should do an album together where they rap cool songs."
1,Too much of Yoko's vocal genetics,He sounds a little like John but I think that can be attributed to the person who produced it. The vocals are almost inaudible and sounds like whispers. Sometimes there is a bit of volume and you think Yoko is singing again (God help us all). I belive the album was produced such that his vocals are not highlighted and that seems to be a good reason.Advice to Sean: Drink a 32oz jar of glass and maybe you can sing acid rock.
3,"Good music, bad singing","The music on this album is great, but I find it hard to listen to just because Sean cannot sing in tune and neither can his female friend who backs him up on ""Into the Sun."" The music has a slightly ""experimental"" sound and is refreshing. The production is quite good and should be, considering Yuka Honda's involvement. Recommended for those without musical experience."
4,A great mixed bag,"This album is really a great, overlooked gem! It is one of the most unique albums I have ever heard, and its great to hear such true musical experimentation in this present bland age that music is in. Unlike other albums musical experiments, Sean uses different styles and methods (jazz, rock, etc) to make catchy, melodic tunes with dreamy surreal lyrics; not just screaming guitars and lyrics about how horrible life is, etc. I think his voice is pleasing and unique. For those who think his voice is bad, I'd like to ask if you are Bob Dylan or Neil Young fans? Great music doesnt need a great voice, it comes from the soul and knows no limits. It's really nice to hear a debut album like this, with emphasis placed on the music rather than all on production and marketing (eg-Backstreet Boys, etc) I cant wait to hear what the next album sounds like. He can only get better, and based on this album you better hang on to your seats, a new frontier of music may be on the horizon!"
5,Sean is Great!,"I really like Sean's Music. I think people expect so much from him because he's John Lennon's son. But he should be treated as an artist. And i think his songs are great. I love Home, Part One Of The Cowboy Trilogy, Into The Sun, and Mystery Juice!"
4,A unique mix of sound and style,"""Into the Sun"" demonstrates the very pleasing abilities of Sean Lennon. In his songs, he drifts through a number of music genres, making full use of many different instruments and techniques. Chameleonesque variety, clear in this collection, is a rare and admirable quality in any artist. A refreshing and enjoyable listen overall."
3,A Good Start,"I bought this CD when it first came out and loved it. It's not as good as his new album ""Friendly Fire"" (2006)which is AMAZING but it shows you how he got his wings."
1,Insubstantial,"Poor Sean,seems to have acquired Yoko's artistic talent, which is non-existant. The only Lennon that has his father's musical capability is Julian."
4,Star Tech composite to HDMI video converter,"Item received as described. Easy setup, got it working in minutes. Hooked it up between my vhs and s-vhs vcrs and Samsung 58"" 3D plasma TV. Worked like a charm on 480 and 1080 resolutions.To obtain a picture on the TV with my regular vhs vcr, I'm required to switch channels on my s-vhs vcr (which is hooked directly onto the converter), that is, the vhs vcr passes through the s-vcr.Sometimes when I'm running a tape through the vhs vcr on fast forward review or rewind review scan mode, the converter cannot ""keep up"" and ""blue-screens,"" in which case I needed to stop and switch channels on the s-vhs vcr to ""re-activate"" the satellite signal to the TV through the converter.This doesn't seem to happen when passing a signal through the s-vhs vcr only (the direct connection to the converter). However, if you do not daisy chain different types of vcrs like I do then this probably won't be a problem for you."
3,Thought Provoking,"Well thought out by George even though as a practicing Christian I have to disagree with my old classmate. As I told him, ""We will have to agree to disagree."" Gives some good insights into atheists, not that I ever thought atheists are evil but simply people with a different belief system than mine. Excellent comments about separation of church and government in which I am in total agreement...to the annoyance of some family members. Isn't this what this country was based on?"
5,Best Kept Secret,"This is great for those who don't care to fill children up with medications and prefer to take a natural approach. The contents of this ""wellness in a bottle"" are herbal and can also be used by adults. When my children started coming down with colds; I gave it to them and saw an improvement within 24 hrs. Also, if your child has ungoing upper-respiratory issues this is a great help. The name of the product says the rest."
5,"Only 18 and This kid is a Genius,","This kid is a genius, There are only few who have come close to pushing the limits of raw human feeling. George Winstion says""he's a rare talent"". The White Door is some of Jason's past works, It is a rare sound, And a rare album, This cd is an entertaning inspiration. A modern composer with a classical tutch who has won the hearts of hundreds of thousands.Jason's is currently working on his 9th album somewhere in Europe it should hit all major record stores soon.Jeffory Müller, EMG"
3,Worth It,"I'll admit, communication theory made my head hurt as I had the daunting task of taking several theorists, study their theories, then present the information to the class in plain english. Sometimes it was difficult, but I learned a lot.This book is really awesome (after the fact), and I'm sure my classmates feel the same way.But here's the funny thing: it's been a year since I've taken that class, and I can still remember the theorist, the theory, and sometimes I go around watching behavior and I'm able to call out the theory and some of the traits expressed in that theory. That's thanks to Em for making the text plain and sometimes simple.Also, my teacher was just good.If you apply yourself and attempt to open your mind you'll like the book regardless of the price. I still have my old blue one, although there is a newer edition (a green one). *wink*"
3,Communications,"A bit pricey for what it is, but there are adequate online resources available from the publisher as well as the ""Conversation"" videos with the theorists."
3,"Buy the older edition, save money","Publishers must think people are complete sheep. The new edition is not critically different from the older copies. The version-mill game is designed to do nothing but eliminate competition from the used book market. (pro tip:the new versions are 99% unchanged, they just want your money)Also, try switching majors before you graduate, a com degree does not make you any more eminently employable than general studies."
2,Not enough info before I bought it,"I am a massage therapist for over 10 years. I bought this item for my clients.The Online info / description did not mention that this product should Not be used more than ""4 timesin a 24 hour period."" The included instruction was sent along by the product but it was too late. I alreadypaid for it.If I had known I would NOT have bought this product. It was not cheap: about $40.00The product itself is good but not in my case.Also: I wanted to return it so I called the company and left 2 massages. They Never called me back.This is why I am giving 2 stars only. Sorry"
1,Doesn't stay warm long,"I was looking for a good heating pad that stayed warm ( actually hot ) for a good long period of time. The product doesn't get hot, if it does its very temporary and cools very quickly. It stays moist warm for 5-10 minutes or so... you can't re-heat after it cools either, you have to wait an hour or whatever the package says so it can re-take I the moisture or whatever.Buy an electric Thermophore Deep Heat System pad and be done with the lousy microwave bead stuff..."
2,Does Not Heat Up Enough,"I followed the directions, but this heat pack does not seem to retain heat when put in the microwave. As per instructions, I tried heating it longer. It warns you not to overheat it and to give it a 2 hour break between uses to let the beads reabsorb moisture before reheating.My physical therapist applied a heat pack that got hotter and hotter and it felt really good to have it quite HOT and not just a bit warm. But this pack just does not seem hot enough even after heating it longer. I did spray a slight mist onto it to see if it would help some, and it did seem to help a little, but I had to be careful not to get the beads wet and just to make the outside slightly moist.I am going to see if I can find out what brand the physical therapy department uses and get one like they use."
3,Works very well - for awhile!,"I would give this product five stars for its immediate value in providing excellent moist heat relief. So, five stars for that. However, I have had trouble with this and its differently sized cousins wearing out fairly fast and ""rupturing"" little beads everywhere. Patching the hole is not a good option with anything I have tried yet. And those little beads provide hours of cleanup fun when this happens!So, not great for any regular use until the company decides to make them to last. Since the company makes more money when they wear out, I do not think they ever will make a stronger cover. But it works wonderfully for awhile. If you need to use this sort of thing a lot, get an electric heating pad and use this only when moist heat is a must."
5,Holds heat well,"This is perfect for hip, tummy, or back. It covers a wide area. It does have some weight to it, so take that into consideration. The moist heat is wonderful!"
5,DURO-MED THERABEADS KING SIZE MOIST HEAT PACK,Recently had physical therapy for back injury and they used a similar product for relief of my pain. It worked quite well so I purchased this for home use.
2,didn't hold heat and was uncomfortable,"I expected that it would hold the heat longer than it did, and it was also uncomfortable laying on the beads."
1,Does not stay hot!,Will never order this product again. Fails to hold heat for more than about 20 min.Will be ordering Medi-beads product that worked before.
4,Does NOT come with a cover!!,"These are GREAT moist heating pads and this size is just right to cover better than half your back. HOWEVER, it does NOT come with a cover as claimed in the title so don't be surprised when you don't get one! Made a homemade cover for it instead of returning because it was a good buy despite the missing cover....hence the four star rating instead of three."
2,Not what I expected,"The product does not stay hot, lasts less than 10 minutes. Don't waste your time with this product, very disappointing."
2,Expected more... but i don't hate it,"I think this pad heats up nice and quickly (2-3 min). It is nice and toasty when it comes out and goes on my back... But the moment I sit down to relax with it, the warmth starts to fade. The real deep heat lasted only a few minutes... AFter that, barely warm for another 15 min or so. I expected it to start hotter and stay hotter."
2,not worth it,"unfortunately this item failed to live up to my expectations. instead of 30 seconds on each side, it actually took 6 minutes total to warm up. Once it did warm up, it smelled terrible. I was planning on using this as a massge therapist for my business, but i don't want any of my clients to deal with that smell. i wouldn't recommend this."
3,Would had made a decent television series.,"When you are watching this movie, you have to realize that it wasn't intended as a stand alone movie, but as a pilot for a television series that was never picked up, which is why there are so many loose ends and questions left unanswered. Saying that, if you think of it like a movie it is a letdown that wastes too much time telling the beginning of the story, little character development and almost no action. However, if you think of it as a pilot which it really is, you can enjoy the movie a little more and start to enjoy the character and scenery introduction. But unless there is a series or another movie, you are still left with only the stories beginning."
4,Great fun for Simpsons fans!,Fun set for those Simpson fans out there. I actually got this for my husband since he loves the Treehouse shows.
4,"Still criminally underrated,","Containing one of Britain's anthems of the last few years in '57' Blackened Sky is a demonstraton that this kind of music doesn't neccessarily have to sound the same as everyone else, a la takingbackfromautumntofinch.Biffy Clyro are one of the tightest bands around and can pull off a great live show, which should really be exposed to a bigger audience, instead of the constant support slots for 'hyped' bands.I'd recommend this to all."
5,The start of things to come,"Biffy Clyro have to be one of britain's most underrated bands. Blackened Sky is a full blown alternative rock album. All the songs are full of emotion and guts. Good singles have appeared from this album, such as 27,57, j.d.i and justboy.A must buy album."
1,Boring and unoriginal,"I have been hearing hype for this band for the past year. When I actually heard it I began to view my mates music taste with suspicion. O.K 1 star is a little cruel and vindictive, but if you are into this style of music, there are probably around one thousand other bands you may want to check out first. These are the sort of songs that a decent band would leave off an album."
4,decent puzzle,"My son is just 1 yr old. He has this puzzle. He likes eating on the pieces more than anything, but it is fun to point out buildings, structures, colors, and activities in the puzzle. The only thing that I don't really like is the busyness of the puzzle...meaning, there is so much stuff crammed into the puzzle. It is hard to focus on any one thing."
1,Tavener surpasses himself,"And I thought Tavener couldn't make his music--you know, the piece he keeps writing over and over again--any more dreary and boring and lightweight than it already was. Yet here we are. A masterpiece of pabulum, melancholy and repetitious and excruciatingly dull.I certainly hope he some day sits down and writes that second composition we've all been waiting for."
1,Please don't encourage him.,"pretentious, pri-ten'shus, a. Full of pretension; pretending to or falsely claiming talents, skills, or qualities. This guy's got it all, mysterious sounding names for his compositions AND mysteriouser sounding chants and resonances, but most mysterioustist is how anyone can even stand to listen to this claptrap. Maybe that's why this jerk has gotten so much press, people don't understand his mystical Eleusinian sensibility and are curious as to what he knows that the rest of us don't. Well, here's a secret I'll be glad to share. Often, people with below average talent or inspiration tend to try to veil their inadequacies in whatever way they can. Apparently, Tavener has found his vehicle. At any rate, don't believe the hype: I laughed more when I heard this than when I sampled the Macho Man's rap album."
4,"Byzantine chant mediated through Tavener,","This would not be one of my favourite Tavener CDs, being a kind of Byzantine/Tavener hybrid but without the input of the english choral tradition which is evident in a lot of Tavener's work. Like all Tavener music, it is highly meditative and evocative, it smells and taste of the East and of transcendence but it does not quite have the hearftelt quality of the Veil of the Temple. It is definitely to be recommended if you are a Tavener fan. If you are new to Tavener, then pick up some of the Naxos CDs instead."
2,I've Seen Worse,"Bottom line, it's not very good, but it happens to be the very last film (TV or movies) that Eleanor Parker ever did. For that it is worth it, she is still beautiful and classes up the younger actors."
5,A Serious Look at Astrology,"When I found this book, I knew nothing about the serious study or history of astrology. I was amazed to learn a great deal from this study. Dr. Ness presents an engaging, readable, and often humorous look at astrology and Jewish synagogue mosaics. The illustrations are useful and the annotated bibliography is a great resource!"
3,It works,This thing is fast and works well however for my next reader I will be getting one that does both Compact Flash and Smartmedia. Most cameras nowadays are Compact Flash so that limits the usability of this device unless all you're going to be using it for is Smartmedia.
4,scatch-proof bracelet?,"This watch is a beauty! Absolutely stunning!However, I found the bracelet is not scratch-proof at all!!!After wearing it for one week, it got scraches all over the band! I am not doing some heavy-duty work, I just read books, write notes, with the bracelet rubbing against table surface occassionally.I know for protecting the watch, I am not suppose to do that, but be realistic, it's a watch, how can I keep my arm in the air the whole time to display the watch, and not do any work?It should have some scratch-proof at least...Do you gals have the same problem with the bracelet?"
3,"Intriging novel, but a bit derivative...","Kevin Anderson's debut novel ""Resurrection InC"" has some very good passages, and the action(once it starts) moves fast. Danlo, a newly formed ""Servent"" that is a corpse that is animated by a microprocessor, becomes ""self-aware"", and tries to figure out if he remembers his life before his death. Parts of the novel ""pay homage"" to ""1984"", with a doomed heroine named Julia that awakens a cog in a monsterous machine to the evil he is doing. Villain is of course, power-hungry, condescending and slightly insane, using a form of ""Satanism"" as a joke to fool the masses. Nice use of San Francisco here, and good reference to R.U.R and Kapek."
4,Fun Read That Keeps on Giving,4 Stars - It was too short.Fantastic pacing with such a fun story. Read this.
3,Something Sorta Annoyingly Wonderful,"I enjoyed this book although with any of these ""regency romance"" novels I didn't expect to be greatly surprised as I knew what I was in for as far as this partucular formula goes, but I found the contrived misunderstandings toward the end quite unbelievable. I have felt this way before with McNaught books but I found this one particularly annoying. I recommend this book if your like me and get obsessed with a particular author and need to read everything the author has written. I read Whitney my love and was feverish for more McNaught. I wouldn't recommend this to just anyone as the book has the staple cliche plot points that usually are found lacking by the average fiction readers that are not so forgiving in regards to the romantic genre."
2,Save your money,"This is my first and also my last Judith McNaught novel. I only finished it because I paid for it, had I taken it our from the library I would've returned immediately. Neither lead character is engaging, to each other or to the reader."
5,My Favorite!,"Something Wonderful was my first thick romance novel I've read and after 7 years it's still my favorite. So far I've never read any book that has made me laugh out loud and made me cry like ""Something Wonderful"" did to me. It made such an effect that I still read it (probably more that 10 times)."
5,Thanks again Judith McNaught!!!!!,"GREAT book! Loved it! I love a feisty, rebellious heroine (because she's so unlike me!) and I love a gentle yet hard to get main man! Perfect combo for a great story! Really enjoyed every minute of the book and loved the characters! I even cried my eyes out at some parts and laughed out loud at others! Recommended for some good entertainment and a book you won't want to put down!"
4,"Not quite Once and Always, but . . .","This was a very sweet book at the beginning, but it irritated me that he would stop believing in her. . .Other then that I loved the way he courted her and his grandmother was a wonderful addition to the book. The ending was a little predictable but in a way that you really want it to end."
4,I wanted to slap him!,"I loved the story, the plot and the characters. I just wanted to slap him silly! Four stars instead of five because I wasn't sure what finally made him realize what a treasure he had! Still a keeper that I read again once in a while."
5,Very Romantic,"Once again, Judith McNaught has written something wonderful. It's so easy to fall in love with her characters. Alex is an irrepressible, spirited, young country girl who literally becomes the jaded Duke of Hawthorne's knight in shining armour. When she saves his life, he reluctantly marries her to save her reputation. However, before she discovers his true character, he disappears and then is believed to be dead. He escapes from imprisonment to claim her only to find that she is about to marry his cousin. Back together, they must learn to trust each other while tangled in a plot of jealousy and revenge.McNaught spins a romantic tale with only her brand of wit and humour. The plot flows along smoothly; there isn't a dull moment in the story. You can't help but fall in love with Alex and Jordan. I highly recommend this for the avid romance reader."
3,more hate than romance,"this was a good book but oh it could of been better miss macnaught if you read this review please have a heart to the female roles of your books they have to suffer so much before they can find true love, and the male leads as if they are the victims.this book could ofcut of a lot of chapters."
4,Another Goodie,"I totally enjoyed this book. It grabbed me from page one and never let go. this remains on my shelf for yet another one of those book droughts I know I will have, and will sustain me until another Judith McNaught masterpiece is written."
5,Something Wonderful by Judith McNaught,"This is a wonderful, well written story that gets you hooked up in the characters. I enjoyed this book to the very last page."
5,"ASTOUNDING, FANTASTIC","I've read many of Judith McNaught's books. This one was my ultimate favorite. McNaught has a talent for catching the reader's interest and holding onto it until you're done. When you finish, you will want to read it over and over again. I stayed awake all night until I finished ""Something Wonderful."" McNaught is a fabulous writer and I can't wait until I read the rest of her wonderful novels."
5,Excellent reading!!!,This is one of my personal favorites. This book was so well written it took just hours to read. I was entranced. Buy to keep for you might want to read it several times.
2,wonderful start but lacked in the second half,"I truly loved the beginning of this book when Alexandra was 17 and naive and I really laughed at the things she said. I also liked that he was sweet to her back then. But I thought he was abusive, always in a rage against her and kept barking orders. I felt it lacked a link between the 2 main characters... I love Judith McNaught and I'll keep reading her amazing stories even though this one didn't make me shiver as her books usually does."
5,Wornderful!,"It's a great book, with lot's of good conversations and there's a conflict too. It's just great."
5,Absolutely unforgettable,"""Something Wonderful"" is probably the best of all the Regency romance I have ever read (among others, I have read all of JM's). I say ""probably"" because I think one other book can challenge the ""the best"" title, and that other one is ""Once and Always"", also by JM. I really can't decide between the two. Both have fabulous characters and enchanting plots. I can hardly wait for her next Regency romance - will we be seeing some old friends (Alex and Jordan, Tory and Jason, and the Westmorelands) there too?"
1,Other reviews look phony,"Look at the other 3 reviews next to this one. All are just 'a reader'. All are unusually short, but full of praise. All give it 5 stars. They're just a tad too perfect. I think they are friends of the author or publisher."
1,Creepy,Made me feel like I was in the twilight zone in the 1950s. I threw it away because I found it to be powerless.
3,Brilliant but Nebulous,"This book has become a classic of historiography of political thought. However, getting through this enormous work and following the argument from 15th century Italy to 18th century America makes for very difficult reading. It is also quite hard to sum up exactly what is the characteristic of republican thought that he is studying (much of this criticism was made by historian Jack Hexter in a review)."
5,Garage door opener,"I have a VERY OLD garage door and the old control was not working very well for the last year an half. My son found this one for me, installed it in less than fifteen minutes, works from across the road. Excellent!"
3,Good for simple programming,"This book covers two programming tools for the Palm; one is HotPaw Basic the other CASL. These are OK; but if you want to write simple useful programs I would recommend PocketC and get the book ""Palm Programming for the Absolute Beginner"" by Andy Harris. With PocketC you can write programs of reasonable complexity.If however you are wanting to write complex programs, you have to get ""Palm OS Programming: The Developers' Guide 2nd ed"" by Neil Rhodes and Julie McKeehan, it is excellent. And I suggest using GCC C/C++ or CodeWarrior if you can spare the dollars."
2,Difficult to use for toddler,These blocks are quite difficult to fit together making it very frustrating for a toddler/preschooler to use. The large size mega-blocks are much better as they easily fit together with no force required.These mini-blocks require a lot of force to put together and I too had trouble building things myself as an adult.I do not recommend this product.
5,Pfaltzgraff Circle of Kindness Bread Board & Knife,This is a beautiful bread boad and knife! Looks like antique ones but in unused condition. I love to display my homemade breads on it. A MUST for homemade bread bakers!
5,Great earphones with great price!,I received today these Sony MDR-EX90LP Stereo Earphones and I'm totally satisfied. At first listen I felt that I'm missing some bass but then I changed medium earbuds to small and they fitted perfectly to my ear canals and sound and isolation improved a lot. I think that the outside noises are blocked out enough - you don't have to compete with traffic or people talking next to you. Bass is deep and high-end is clear - overall I think that you really don't need better earphones to listen to mp3's. Now I just think that why on earth I listened to my ipod for two years with ipod's standard earphones which are crap. [...]$ is bargain for these earphones!note: I've played drums over 15 years so my hearing may have damaged a bit so... don't count on my review too much.
5,Excellent Performance,"I purchased the Sony MDR-EX90LP Stereo Earphones a month ago and must say that I am totally satisfied with their performance. I use these with an Ipod Nano (2G). They produce crisp, clean highs and and powerful bass. They are also comfortable and stylish to wear. Try to avoid fake earphones from China that are sold at other sites for around $35. Amazon sells the real Sony product."
2,No No No No No Wrong!!!,"All you five star people!! What are you thinking. I dont get it. Its plane and simple. Thes DO NOT sound as good as the EX71 buds. No No No I dont care what any of you say. This is the only review all you need to read. Buy the EX71 or 81. Bigger driver blaw blaw blaw. I have been using the EX71s for a year or so now. But wanted to splurge so i order these MDR90. Iv been pulling my hair out trying to figure out why my 71's sound so much better. All that tech jargon is worthless TRUST ME!! These MDR90's sound way muffled campared to the 71's. It seems like none of these reviewers have actually tried both models (71's vs 90's) I have!!!!!! with the same player ,same song. Go with the 71's 0r 80's. I hate getting riped off. My brand new MDR 90's are just ornaments now."
2,Definitely not $70 better than the MDR-EX81,"I replaced a pair of Sony's MDR-EX81SL earbuds with these, thinking it was an ""upgrade."" I was wrong. The -EX90's deliver marginally better bass and clarity over my old headphones, a difference far too small to justify any price increase, let alone $70 worth. They are also far less comfortable: despite using the same size ear caps, which are made of the same material, the -EX90's created sore spots in my ear canals after only 3 uses. Finally, the -EX90's are a bit less capable of blocking outside noise.Not to mention, unlike my previous earbuds, the -EX90's don't come in matching Apple white.These are now on their way back to Amazon, where I've since purchased another pair of MDR-EX81's (in white, of course)."
2,Total disappointment....,"I'm tired of spending money buying headphones and I thought that maybe spending a little more and getting these Sony MDR-EX90LP I would be done with my long period of researching and dissatisfaction. I'm still not happy... First thing is that they have asymmetrical cords for the right and left ear ( am I suppose to use this behind my neck?) and I didn't find any information about that. I simply hate that!!I really should just return this after paying almost $90 and not having exactly what I am looking for... I guess I'll just pile them up together with all my other ear buds headphones that I've been buying in the past year.... The iPod ones I've already bought 3 of them... No more!!! ... Then I bought one from Sony, JVC, Panasonic, etc.... They all suck!!! I'm not even thinking about buying the Bose ones 'cause all the reviews say it's not good.... Oh well... What to do???"
3,Sony MDR-EX90LP Stereo Earphones,"Sony MDR-EX90LP Stereo EarphonesWHEN I PURCHASED THE EX90LP THEY WERE $100.00 ALL I CAN SAY IS AT THE NEW CURRENT LOWER PRICE THEY ARE NOT WORTH IT. AS MUCH AS A SONY PRODUCT PERSON I AM THESE ARE DEFINATELY NOT WORTH MORE THAN $25.00 THEY ARE FOR ME DIFFICULT TO STAY IN MY EARS NO MATTER WHAT SIZE RUBBER BOOT I USE AND NEED TO BE CONSTANLY CLEANED THE CENTER SEEMS TO GATHER EAR WAX TOO EASILY, I AM A VERY HYGENIC PERSON AND I KNOW SOME PEOPLE NO MATTER HOW CLEAN SUFFER FROM TOO MUCH WAX IF YOU ARE ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE DEFINATELY STAY AWAY FROM THESE PHONES."
4,Good headphones,"I bought these 'phones to use with a sony NWA-3000 player. My listening is mainly classical, ranging from solo instrumental to large orchestra and opera. They are considerably superior to the supplied headphones, which are decidedly poor for such a relatively expensive player.These headphones take a little running in and initially are lacking in midrange. If carefully fitted, the sound is quite good, although nowhere near as good as over ear headphones.The quality of seal is important. Although not strictly noise-cancelling headphones, the correctly size ear canal attachment must be used to maximize the quality of the sound.I would recommend these as a moderately priced alternative to Shure et al. In fact these are my second pair - I ripped a cord of one 'phone while walking through a door (my fault - not the headphone)."
2,Great except one channel failed in less than 6 months,"I bought these heaphones for jogging, replacing cheaper Sony MDR-A35G phones ($15-20). I used to be able to get 6-9 months out of the MDR-A35G phones before one channel failed. Then Sony must have changed their supplier. More recent headphones (in 2007, 2008) would snap into two within the first two weeks.The MDR-EX90LP have much, much better sound, really great sound, are comfortable, easy to put in, and stay in fairly well when jogging, but the sound failed in one channel within six months.Adios Sony!I switched to Sennheiser CX 500-B, which also have great sound and seem more durable, but they won't stay in my ears while jogging, especially in the summer in Washington D.C when I'm sweating like a fish.Now I'm trying the Sennheiser PMX80 Sport Series II Behind the Head Ear Phones For Sports, but, I have to admit, the sound was better with the Sony MDR-A35 phones!"
4,Good basic earphones,"Although this is not one of those fancy-schmancy noise-blocking earphones, this pair does damp down environmental sounds.It fits comfortably in the ear and performs very well for the commuters that enjoy a soundtrack to their travels."
3,Sony MDR-EX90 LP Earphones,"I was trying to replace a very good pair of earbuds (good for sound quality) that were large and very uncomfortable in my ears, with as good of sound quality earbuds , but hopefully more comfortable for my ears.With the Sony product, the sound quality was not there. Poor bass, okay mid tones, shallow high tones.Not at all what I expected, given the price.Got real frustrated with trying earbuds and finally replace the earbuds with collapsible Bose earphones. Bose is just slighly better than what I had, nicer/cleaner high tones, good solid bass, good mid tones.And my husband took my earbuds that were to big and uncomfortable for me!"
4,good headphones,i like them because they don't fall out or get loose but they is a gap between earpiece and ear where i can still here outside noise.
1,Obtained fake ones from the seller,"I bought these earphones recently. At first sight, the ear buds didn't look authentic and sound was tinny. Th earbuds were not comfortable and my ears started to pain a bit and also developed slight irritation in the ears. I contacted amazon and they were kind enough to give me a refund. The worst part is that in few days, I noticed the differences in the earphones that I have from the authentic sony MDREX90LP earphones. I was surfing through ebay the other day and to my surprise I came to know that nowadays fake sony MDREX90LP earphones are being sold by few people. I found out that my earphones were fake ones. Amazon is reliable for shopping various products but be aware of the fake ones from different sellers on amazon."
2,There is a reason you can get these for $20 on Ebay,"I had no problems with comfort as others have described, but the sound quality was bad. The middle range, 250Hz-2.5kHz, washed everything out. The bass response was poor but I took that with a grain of salt since my current earphones are known to be bass heavy. I could make them sound really good with some major EQ adjustments in iTunes. Once I had the EQ dialed in they sounded great. Very clear. The bottom line is my $15 Skullcandy earphones sound almost as good and don't require the EQ to do it."
2,Like shoving hot pokers in your ears,"I bought these after looking at several reviews. Most reviews are positive toward the sound quality. And I do agree with that, the sound quality is pretty decent.However, the comfort of these things is horrible. I kept thinking it was the tips that were bothering me and kept trying the different sizes. Also ordered comply tips. After much experimenting I was looking in the mirror at them (while in my ears) and realized it had nothing to do with the tips. It is the circular metal housing just behind the tip. Much too large. It presses against some of the other protruding parts of your ears. Within 5 minutes these things are becoming uncomfortable. Within a few songs I was ready to get these parasites out of my ears.Look elsewhere. Earbuds with driver housings that are narrow near where you insert them into your ears are a better choice."
4,"sound quailty is great, but cord kinda fragile","very satisfied with sound quality, very clear, good bass, mids and not muddy like the sl70's.only compliant is the construction of the cabling. very thin wiring and could get yanked if not careful."
3,"lack of bass sound, unconfortable for me.","I'm quite disappointed, I've both this and and 30 dollars model Sony MDR-EX51LP, unfortunately despite these are much cheaper, they have the same quality of sound, and much more bass.Plus the Sony MDR-EX51LP are much more light, comfortable, and they isolate the sound in a better way.So don't waste your money for these go for the Sony MDR-EX51LP."
4,Good !,Everything was fine dispite of that the customer service sometimes didn't write back soon (maybe it was Christmas season and they were extremely busy).
2,Not Slimming enough for Women,"While Avery is the industry standard for office supply products, this binder lacks the quality of its counterparts. Not only is the binder not the proper size to fit a substantial quantity of women, but it does not physically appealing. Black usually has a slimming effect for women with problem areas. The color doesn't help in terms of giving the women that would fit this binder a more flattering appearance."
2,Threatened,"Avery Heavy-Duty View Binder with 1.5 Inch One Touch EZD Ring, Black, 1 Binder (79695)I am returning this binder immediately. It was packed full of women who deserve equal pay as me. Mitt Romney had assured me this wouldn't happen. And he has gone back on his word. Turns out all of these women aren't recyclable either."
4,Great little binder - not all-purpose though,"Nice construction, nice quality, good workmanship. Price not too bad either. This is a great binder that will hold anything with three holes. Well, almost anything."
2,Good at first but haven't lasted,"I purchased these binders in August for the fall semester. I use them twice a week during class and minimally outside of class. I thought these would be ideal with the no gap rings, the easy open, and the ""heavy duty"" use. However, in November, just a few short months after purchase, both of the binders I purchased have gaps in the rings. One has very small gaps (still affect page turning) but the other has a large 1/4"" gap which makes page turning impossible. I will purchase these again in the hope that I just bought two from a bad batch, but I'm disappointed in the short life of these binders in doing what they are advertised to do."
5,never buy another binder,"I homeschool 2 girls, and I like to keep organized. The first two years we had to buy new binders, the third year we splurged and got 3 boxes of these. They are durable, the view pockets are great for being able to label the binder and relabel it without it looking used. In short, they're awesome, and I would not consider any others in the future."
5,good qulity,The binders I received are the same good quality as if I get them in local store. The price is about $2 cheaper. What can I say. thumb up Amazon.
1,Review of the binder,The inner pockets of the binder are not glued properly and came off as soon as I put in them some papers
2,Scratched Plastic Surface,The front plastic outside surface is so scratched the information displayed cannot be read. Not worth the cost or hassle to return this product.
5,Best Binder Ever,This binder has the easiest opening and closing method I have ever used. It also has four sleeves on the inside. Came in very good condition. Well worth the money.
3,Fits it's purpose,Got this for my 6 yr old for school. Has clear pockets on the front and back also in the inside on both sides. What I like is to close the ring binders has an easy push tab that close the rings. Love this because my 6 yr old would get his skin caught on his old ring binder.
2,Looks used on the outside but nice inside,"This is a very sturdy binder and the EZD ring allows papers to sit nicely. Amazon purchase had scuff marks on front & back cover (like something had been repeatedly rubbing against the clear plastic). Also parts of the edges were ragged and rough. I'm guessing these binders are the ones no one wanted to buy from the local office supply store. Very disappointed in the ""used"" appearance however inside the binder works fine."
1,would not buy from seller,i have tried to order three different times with a current visa credit card....it never accepts it....and the seller is no help!
3,Had to Retun because of Duplication,"All of family knew 6-yr old granddaughter was getting Loving Family Dollhouse for Christmas. So different family members bought some different items, rooms of furniture, etc or house. This Twin Time Dolls with Mom & Dad turned out to be a duplicate gift. So I had to return which was relative easy. But I don't much like te 20% restocking fee."
5,!,"If you haven't heard of TeX this probably isn't the place to start. But for a scintillating peek behind the scenes at twenty years of TeX and Metafont, this is the book to read."
2,Dangerous piece of equipment,"We purchased this steamer last year. Unfortunately, the pole on this model is poorly designed. The screw that holds both poles in place is too short. As a result, the pole will not stand-up properly. Very dangerous piece of equipment. Do not buy until pole design has been changed."
4,Steamer Review,More than expected for the price. Have used much more expensive Professional units in previous years. Would recommend this to anyone needing a reliable steamer.
2,overrated,"I love Bali and its spheres, I love electronic music. but this i.m.o. is some new age popular synth music with the obvious bali samples. Instead checkDavid Parson's Ngaio gamelanthats beautiful art"
4,Very good but...,"The first ""Bali"" is so good I couldn't wait to get this one too.Although it is very good, there is something about it that can't match the sheer simple beauty of the first. There is much more synthesizer here and a lot more going on which I thinks detracts from the pure, simple sounds of peace that the first one delivered. Also, the songs do not flow nearly as well on ""Dua"".If you liked the first disc you will probably like this one too but just be prepared to expect something a little more busy and synthesized."
5,i absolutely love it !,"Heard this album at the B&O showroom and immediately went to buy the album. No regrets, all the songs are very good. I love it !"
1,IT WAS NEVER GOOD,"This is undoubtedly one of the most boring, self-serving bios I've ever had the misfortune to come upon. No narrative value, poor grammar."
5,Good Stuff,"This is album is great. The perfect combination of smooth, sensual sounds. Perfect for relaxing or for the intimate time you spend with your lady or man. I recommend you get this one."
5,Oh My!!,Bought for my daughter. She loved it and so did the kids in her class at school. Glad to have it
4,Good Value,"If you're looking for a reasonably priced mp3 player, you've found it. The player itself is lightweight, and a real value. It's expandable with an SD Card. I'm not a highly critical listener. But, if you are, you shouldn't be buying an mp3 player anyway. The only negatives I've found are the cheap earbuds, and the snap closures on the vinyl case. I've repl;aced the 'buds'. And I'll live with the snaps. Hey, I didn't buy this for the long haul. If it lasts 3 years, until the technology stabilizes for this product group, it will have met my needs."
5,Sandisk Sansa SDMX2 1GB,"I have owned the Sansa E140 about a month and so far I think it is a fantastic MP3 player. Haven't any trouble with it at all. The battery seems to last as long as the advertised rating of 19 hours. I use the custom setting on equalizer, the music can be sorted by album or artist and is very easy to manipulate."
1,i hate this thing!,"I got this cheap, defective product, not knowing what was to come. it came and i listened to music, no problems at all. The next day, I put the mp3 player in my purse, in its case all protected. when i took it out after school, the screen was cracked and it was completly broken. I never dropped my purse or the mp3 player, and it was protected all day. i listened to about 20 minutes of music and had it 1 day. Save your money and get an ipod nano instead, like i recently got. trust me it is soooo much better and it can hold pictures. Take my warning seriously and DON'T BUY THIS CHEAP, DEFECTIVE SANDISK PRODUCT! the Ipod nano is better. take my advice and don't waste your money!But Amazon did give me a refund. that was the only good part."
2,Not what I expected,"I bought this player for it's ability to use removable media. Had it less than a month and am already having significant problems. Player turns itself off in the middle of a song or e-book, arbitrarily locks up while scrolling through menus, and frequently cannot recognize SD cards. The only way to delete songs from the player or SD card is to sync with your PC. Player will allow you to put more mp3s on it than it should and not leave itself enough room for the system files to execute rendering it useless. Poor documentation for operation and/or troubleshooting. All in all, very disappointing. Had to finally return it to Sansa after several attempts to remedy though the help desk. Maybe the next one will be better."
4,going on 6 months with my Sansa mp3 player,"I read the reviews before buying and did my research. This player is great. I have SD cards for my computer, cameras, and now my MP3 player. I use mine in the car with the FM transmitter and having different SD cards with different music allows me to play what I want at that time by plugging a different card. This feature alone sold me on the Sansa but I can also say the music quality is great and the feel of the unit is good. It could improve on the menus a bit but once you are use to it even this is fine. I have recommended this player to family and friends. At this price I think anyone is crazy to consider an ipod over this one."
2,"not compatible with ""napster to go""","don't believe the ""plays for sure"" sign that amazon.com puts on this webpage. I got this player thinking that I would be able to transfer songs from napster to it only to find out that the mp3 player is not compatible with napster."
4,Great product!,"This MP3 player is a good pick! Easy to download music, lots of menu options, sound quality is outstanding, and the price is perfect. I would recommend this product, no doubt. The downfalls are related to personal preference, such as attaching the unit to my body while working out is not comfortable for me (arm strap) and I had to buy a different headset."
2,damaged,"i received my mp3 player with a big black spot in the middle of the screen, i sent it back and it has been 2-3 months & i havent heard anything back whether they will replace it or give me a credit."
1,breaks easily,"I picked the Sansa e 140 for running and it came with the armband and the SD card slot was a nice touch. What I found is it is made cheap and breaks easily and SanDisk will not stand behind it. My Bro has an ipod, it is made to last and will be what I buy next"
5,Excellent Choice!,"I purchased this mp3 player about 3 months ago, and let me say, I am extremely pleased with this product! I got a great deal on it buying from Amazon (about $55 I think). The Sd expansion slot is great as well, allowing me to have up to 3 gigs of music to play on this. The audio quality is important to me and this superseeded my expectations. The included earbuds have tremendous sound and bass clarity. I would reccomend this mp3 player to just about anybody looking for a great quality medium/high capacity auidio player and dosent want to spend the money on an ipod."
2,"Cheap, pretty dependable, but sometimes...","The features on this player are outstanding for the price. I was impressed by the ability to expand the memory, the built-in FM receiver, and the size of the player. However, not being able to use playlists, no rechargeable battery are drawbacks. There are strange quirks with it too, mixing up tags on songs, and the sometimes very slow startup of the unit is annoying at best. It takes some time for the unit to respond and advance to the next song when you hit the forward button, but once you get used to it it's ok. I would rate this about a C-."
2,No playlist management and a scroll wheel to throw out the window,"I bought this one for my wife specifically because I didn't think she'd use it enough to merit an ipod. I may have wasted my money. How hard would it have been to add even the most basic ""a folder on the disk equals a new playlist"" level of management? Or m3u files? Since she listens in the van with the kids I wanted a way to put both her music and the kids on it altogether but still keep track of whose is whose.And the plastic scroll wheel in the upper corner, forget it. You need two hands to use this thing since you can't reach the buttons, the menu and the scroll wheel in the combination that you need.I will give it points for just being a simple USB flash drive and not making me run special software. That helps. And the expansion card is nice. But, honestly, I would have been better off with a Nano."
4,A nice mp3 Player,"Very Good mp3 player. Good Price. It have basically all the features of other more expensive mp3 player.Good sound!! Good earphones design!!The posibility of expands memory with cards is a really good idea.Certainly, it is a litle bit ambiguous at the beginning of use but it is not a really problem."
1,Horrible!,it doesnt work good at all! The scroll on the side gets all messed up long with the volume. It gets scratched up WAY to easy. I really dont prefer this at all!
2,dies on 3rd day,"I got one 2 days ago and it fails to turn on today. No idea what's going on. The only attempt I made is to replace the battery.As of the player itself, the battery cover is kind of loose. I doubt it's gonna last long if you don't use that ugly plastic skin.Good thing is this player supports multi-language titles."
2,Bleh - Terrible Firmware,"DO NOT, DO NOT, DO NOT buy this. At least not until there is a FIRMWARE update released. The form factor is nice, but the design of the software it TERRIBLE. Songs are in alphabetical order, no playlists are supported.The included headphones are THE WORST HEADPHONES I've heard in my life. THE WORST.Beyond just about everything, it's freakin awesome!"
1,totally unsatisfactory,This is an unacceptable product. Thin sound even with good earphones. Directly compared on strong FM reception with a similar flash memory unit this one fails badly.
1,Needs Windows 2000,I made the mistake of buying this iteam. It does not state anywhere that you need Windows 2000. If you don't the only thing you can use is the radio. So make sure you have Windows 2000. I found this out the hard way. That is $95 dollars down the drain.
4,good but not perfect,its clustiring files by tags of the mp3. Its better to make it by folder system as in sony muvo. But i offer this product anyway.
3,Don't bother with a 2 Gig card,"This player works well and is easy to use, but in my experience it does not work with 2 gig cards, it will only really use about 1 gig of the capacity. To make a very long story shorter, I went back and forth with their tech support, who did respond promptly, but even after a firmware update, the player would simply ignore random parts of data on the card once 1 gig was exceeded. This occured on both an Adata card and a Sandisk Ultra II 2 gig card, no differences by brand. Within the 1 gig limit, the player works very well."
