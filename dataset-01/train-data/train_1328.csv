2,Agree with Kenneth Ryan,"I agree wholeheartedly with Kenneth Ryan's review. This book was ""recommended"" reading in one of my English classes at UCLA several years ago, and I bought it, but just now picked it up for a read. The problem is that the main character is so vapid that I simply did not CARE what happened to her. It has always been my firm belief that one must identify with, care about, or even despise a main character to care enough to keep reading. This novel was painful to finish; who cares what happens to these people? I agree that whatever ""splash"" the book made in its day came from the shock value it would have had because of the amorality of its characters. It's hard to shock us these days, and the book is now just plain uninteresting."
2,"The same dream, always in color","This book illustrates the difference between important and merely influential. It virtually invented the vague/portentious prose style that signifies boredom and alienation, and appeared as late as 1996 on the liner notes of Rage Against the Machine's ""Evil Empire"".But it isn't very good. The dimestore existentialism aged, badly. Didion's spare writing now seems phony and juvenile. The same characters experiencing the same emotions have been rehashed so many times, often in superior forms, that what was innovative in the seventies doesn't really cut it anymore. Not that it was very original in its time, coming as it did after thirty years of Sartre and ten of Antonioni. Not to mention Horace McCoy's terrific 1935 novel ""They Shoot Horses Don't They"", popularized in a Hollywood film (coincidentally?) only a year before ""Play It""'s publication.A minor footnote to a still-evolving trend."
2,"Not Much There, There","I bought this novel since it was listed on Time Magazine's list of the Best 100 Novels written in English since 1923. I have no idea why Time Magazine selected it for that esteemed honor. It was mercifully short (easily finished in a couple of hours, if that), but otherwise provided modest rewards for those looking for high-quality literature. Proving a sketch of the morally-bankrupt Los Angeles drug and sex scene of the 1960s, primarily through the internal mental narrative of 31-year-old would-be actress Maria Wyeth, Play It As It Lays doesn't seem to plow any new ground in 20th century literature. Its description of Maria's poorly-performed illegal abortion is the most memorable scene in an otherwise forgettable pastiche of characters and settings. Being on Time's 100 List sets a burden of expectations, and this book certainly fell far short on that score."
2,A really long short story,"This book reads like a really long short story, with little character development or plot. It holds up poorly. There is little one would find shocking in it today and in fact Didion seems almost prudish in her references to sex."
4,Bret Ellis-lite,"I know, I know, Ellis totally totally robbed Didion. There is no question. This book and Less Than Zero are like estranged cousins living similarly damaged lives in the same city. This book is arguably more subdued, as it takes place in the 60s and doesn't end with the kind of horrific imagery that the Zero does. It is brisk, semi-brutal (not really compared to Ellis) and more than a little harrowing. A woman is confounded, side-lined, and generally made to feel the pain of a male-dominated, coldly hedonistic culture. She must have an abortion, gets harangued on movie sets, wanders aimlessly, lies around in bed a lot feeling blue. It is depressing, for sure, but well written with a kind of needle-point clarity Ellis surely must have found intriguing, as he pilfered it for his own. If Less than Zero was too much for you, you might find something to ""enjoy"" here. It is pretty ennui-ridden, but is over quickly. A kind of void of a novel. You'll see."
5,Awesome!,"I love Starship, and have since I was a little girl. My parents were big fans and I grew up listening to them. I love A LOT of their older stuff, but this is by far my favorite of all their albums, so when it snapped in two, I had to get on here and order another copy!"
4,Excellent rock music!!,"I have several Starship albums and ""Love among the Cannibals"" isone of their most underrated pieces of work. Great vocals by Mickey Thomas. Grace Slick is missing from the mix, but the music holds its own. Creative lyrics and excellent rock music!"
3,STARSHIP abandons their slick cheezy sound...,"and rips off somebody else's. Thats right; one listen to the title track ""The Burn"" and Def Leppard immediately comes to mind. "" I didnt mean to Stay all night"", sounds like ""Love Bites"" with stolen drum track included. Hell, Mickey Thomas sounds just like Bryan Adams or Joe Elliot. So, why the sudden chnge. Grace Slick left the band. Robert ""Mutt"" Lange and company entered the picture. Ironically, Mutt Lange produced the aformentioned artists Def Leppard AND Bryan Adams. STARSHIP was sputtering out by the end of the 80's. Logic dictated cashing in on the BIG BUCKS sounds of Def Leppard and Bryan Adams. The result is a mixed bag. The CD is not bad, but the idea of borrowing or sounding like someone else doesnt pour the sugar on me. Theres a few good tunes like ""Not Enough"" and ""Wild Again"". Give this album a shot but refer to STARSHIP's earlier efforts."
5,A Full Engagment with Life and Its Mysteries,"I love Susan Donnelly's book for its generosity, its wit and wisdom. Displaying the poet's breadth of interest, her full engagement with life and its many mysteries, these poems quietly and imaginatively dazzle. Be the subect great (Irish immigrants, the Fifties, a lunar eclipse, love, death) or small (a bruised knuckle, a pink morning glory), Donnelly explores a full range of expression and possibility. This is no off-putting book. There are no manipulations, affectations, or missions. TRANSIT invites the reader in, and Donnelly, with grace, a sharp eye and a straightforward, illuminating voice, proves she is the consummate host."
4,Birthday gift,Bought for my husband and he liked it alot. he doesn't watch alot of movies but the ones he watches he buys. doesn't rent alot. his movies are keepers.the green mile is his favorite. but he liked cowboys way enough to search and buy. thank you.
2,Great movie...but not mine,"I love this movie. I ordered it and watched about two thirds, and it started skipping so bad that it was unwatchable. It makes me think that it's a bad idea to order movies online. This was wrapped, never opened. Maybe people leave these in hot garages for a while before they send them."
1,Delivery SUCKED!!,"I bought this for a friend, told the friend about it as they were going to go looking for it. I told the friend not to do it and gave them the date that Amazon said it would be here. Arrived over a week PAST that date."
3,Very Humorous,"I have only recently viewed this movie. Why did I wait so long? It was very funny, and very entertaining. I would watch it again and again. I read Leonard Maltin's review of the movie. In it he says something about it being ""unrealistic"". Well, duh, it's just a movie. So just relax. It can be unrealistic if it wants to be."
3,"Good son, bad son.","Not the greatest rodeo movie ever made but by no means the worst.Tends to drag on a little but overall is worth the effort. Some of the casting is strange mainly because there is no chemistry between the characters, but the storyline is above average and Keifer Sutherland does enough to carry the rest over the line."
5,Awesome!,I watched this movie when I was about 8 years old and I loved it! But now I'm older and I still watch this movie! I love it!
5,Save Water And Still Have A Beautiful Yard,"If you live in an arid area, remember that ""there is only a certain amount of water in the world and they aren't making any more of it."" An acre of grass takes 27,000 gallons of water a week to keep green. It's hard for some to give up that patch of green grass that America equates with leisure time and suburban living.Having lived in Central Australia, I advocate for full desert landscaping using native plants along with exotics from dry countries.Xeriscaping (water-wise planting) doesn't mean a yard that is a barren moonscape. Think of colorful crape myrtles, bougainvilleas, firebushes, palms, yuccas, and many more interesting plants. Artfully placed, they provide a green view and offset the gravel that replaces grass in a water saving landscape. Mulch everything to insulate the soil and keep moisture in the ground."
5,100 Years From Now,"My first reaction upon opening ""The Truth"" at a random page (the way I've always read Shirley's other books) is amazement in how so few words can have such a disarming impact. If you have the courage to read this, you won't look at anything the same way again - whether you agree or not with the message. I believe 100 (or more) years from now, civilization will look back at ""The Truth"" and still be awed by it. Personally, ""The Truth"" resonates unlike anything 10 times its length."
4,"good quick read, introduction to wholistic truth","written authoritatively with no question in her voice, yet it is so interesting- fascinating even- and my being resonates- i dont mind her know it all tone. sped through it. unification of male and female energies. historical perspectives. emotional-mythic-metaphorical basis to reality. evolution."
5,Awesome song,"I love this song and I had been looking for it for years, I had it on a mix tape and had no idea what the song was until a few years ago I figured it out, I don't even remember how, but I kind of forgot about it until recently and I think the song is so cool, it's one of my favorite songs ever, personally. Music is a subjective thing so it's hard to say what others might think but I just love this song and it's cool that there are a few mixes of it there."
3,Watch for rash,"I had two of these applied over pressure sores in the hospital. On day 2, I developed a red, itchy rash in the exact shape of the dressing. I would just recommend that people check under these dressings often, and remove them if you feel any itching."
1,Not the Queen's Pawn Attack,"I must admit to being totally confused here. I ordered a book with the supposed title of Queen's Pawn Attack Revealed by James Plaskett and received a book entitled The Queen's Bishop Attack Revealed. Instead of it being 160 pages it's 218. The opening is 1. d4, d5 1. Bg5. Now maybe I'm just uninformed and the Queen's Pawn Attack and the Queen's Bishop Attack are the same opening. But if the book's title is The Queen's Bishop Attack then that's how it should be listed! I haven't had time to read the book as I only just received it. Maybe it's a very good book, but only one star due to the deceptive title under which the book is being advertised."
4,Candlelight music from diverse torches......,"Ok, now what instrumental aggregation would choose to create a work with two cover recordings each by Neil Young, Tom Waits, Django Reinhart and Radiohead? Then round off with a little Ornette Coleman, Leonard Cohen, Billy Strayhorn and Horace Silver?The music is cleanly and beautifully recorded. The timbre of the instruments is conveyed so clearly you will swear you can hear the placing of fingers on the fretboards. Crystalline. A calm lake surface is indeed the perfect metaphor.Unlike their eponymous CD, there is no percussion here and, perhaps correspondingly, the pace is more relaxed. The likelihood that any given listener will be familiar enough with ALL the authors to ""pick up"" on many of these melodies is rather remote. For example, this is not ""Southern Man"" or ""Heart of Gold"" era Neil Young. So you will perhaps be enticed to seek out the originals, to see where the inspiration in these tunes came from."
4,"easy on the ears, easy to love.","radiohead's song ""i will,"" and leonard cohen's ""hallelujah,"" are standouts here played by this trio that consists of mandolin, upright bass, and piano (with a little accordian playing thrown in). a recording of all instrumentals that makes for wonderful evening listening (mostly being slow to mid-tempo performances). a refreshing sound unlike any other jazz outfit, i love listening to this disc while i read. excellent stuff."
2,"Great book, terrible study aid","Walton and Rockoff do a great job of describing American economic history. Unfortunately, the textbook reads more like a novel than a college textbook. There are very few study aids throughout the book which makes studying for tests very difficult. There are no 'key words' or margin points, and there is no highlighting of key points by bold font or italics.Additionally, if you have the masochistic pleasure of taking a test based on the publisher's 'instructor's test bank', you will soon realize that the tests are simply recollection and factoid exams, as opposed to a well developed 'principles' and 'concepts' exam that other textbooks use.This textbook is poor college class material."
1,A Horrible Historical Work,"This book does a horrible job of documenting the history of World War I. It has multiple errors, and none of the authors cite any of the works that their essays were developed from, or provide evidence to support their conclusions. There is a selection of works for further reading but there is not a works cited, or footnotes. The problem with this work is that someone who picks up this book to learn about World War I is going to get a lot of poor information, and information that is completely wrong. For a book that carries the tag of Oxford, this is unexceptable. Do not purchase this book, there are many more books out there that properly cite their research and comprehensively explore the causes and effects of the events of World War I."
4,Great for school,"I purchased this book to help me with an assignment in my college British Literature class. The book was very, very helpful."
5,Excellent introduction into human evolution,"Although I originally read this book for Professor Jolly's class, I have since recommended it to friends and family as an excellent, well rounded introduction into human evolution. It tries to examine, in an objective way, the degree to which natural selection has affected both physical and psychological human attributes.Unlike writers such as EO Wilson who seem to argue that science has little if anything to learn from the humanities, Jolly believes that a comprehensive theory of human nature needs to draw on both the sciences and humanities to arrive at a synthetic view. I agree with her view that we cannot reduce humans to their genes, but nor can we ignore the role they play in our behavior.The book is quite well written, and draws liberally on poetry, short stories, and politics as well as science to illustrate her points."
4,"Good info, Great Pics","I pretty much agree with everyone else, this is a very good resource for the experienced or newbie goldfish parent. There's probably more info here than I'll ever need (I don't plan on performing biopsies or even buying a microscope any time soon), but it's well-written and interesting stuff. The basics are covered just as thoroughly, and most of the questions I came up with were answered within a few paragraphs. The photography and production are amazing. An index would have been nice, but it's not necessary as the layout is straight-forward and everything is where you would expect it to be. I don't think I'll ever buy another goldfish book!"
5,great book,I love this book gives lots of information great pictures would diffenetly recomend this book great price for the size of book worth the money
2,Good for Veterinarian,"This book contains very detail information. Half of the book describes about fish diseases and surgery methods, which are not what I am looking for. The author did a good job on pictures, a lot of good gold fish pictures.This book talks too much on other topics that beginner people wont care much. For example, fengshui, fish surgery methods, etc. They less focus on the common knowledge that people want to know.It's good for a collection."
4,"Beautiful Pictures, In Depth Info, but NO INDEX!!!","This book is definitely worth the money. The photos are gorgeous, it makes a marvelous coffee table book. The information is very exhaustive, including a lot of detailed information on breeding, illness, treatment. This is a text for the serious goldfish breeder. My only quibble, and it is significant, is that there is no index. When my red cap oranda was sick last week, I had to go to a much less expensive book because it had a handy symptom chart, and an index in the back."
4,Fancy Goldfish: a Complete Guide to Care and Collecting,"This book did contain the information I was searching for, both visually and in written form. It was off-putting to have the book begin with the diseases, abnormalities, hazards, etc. before it ever got to ""what are fancy goldfish"". Would still recommend."
5,Excellent,"This book has already paid for itself within 1 month. Noticed Ick on a Sun. after shopping hours. Remembered the book, looked it up and there was a remedy. So it saved me money and no chemicals in my tank."
4,An inspiring book,"The author is a warm and intelligent painter who expresses her passion for painting. and inspired a sense of excitement and possibilities in me. The chapter on drawing is extremely helpful. Although the paintings shown are mainly traditional in composition, there is a filip of creativity in subject matter and composition that is moving forward. I believe I can transfer the lessons to painting that I attempt here in the cold and rawness of Canada, Europe being beyond my reach...."
5,One of the best book's I have ever read,"Once you read this book you will know what it was like to have lived in Tombstone Az.and worked at the Bird Cage Theatre,dated Virgil Earp and have been Doc.Holliday's best friend."
5,Number 1,"After reading Rose Callahan, I counted the number of books I've read on Tombstone. This makes 26 and is now on the top of my list. I hope they make it into a movie."
5,Great Book!,I couldn't put this book down! The way it was written makes you feel like you were right there! This book is definately worth reading!
5,The Famous Rose Callahan,"Being an avid reader and a resident of Tombstone, I read anything I can get my hands on about the area. This is, without a doubt, the best ""history"" book of Tombstone I have read to date. I highly recommend it to anyone who is searching for their past!"
1,OZ - 3rd,Bought for a friend as she doesn't have internet. My family and I don't watch stuff that has all the trash contained herein.
4,Weaker than before,"Don't get me wrong, I really like this series, loved the first 2 seasons and liked 3rd season. However in this 3rd season there were some plot lines that were just too hard to admit as reasonably possible. For example Beecher so easily killing an officer and walking so easily away from it, it was never mentioned afterwards; and what about Glynn and McMannus just letting Schillinger's song in Beecher's hand, How can these 2 guys , responsible for running such a dangerous prison as Oz, be so naive and allow Beecher and other Schillinger's sworn enemies withing 100 miles of this boy?,"
2,no dvd,Still waiting over a month to get my DVD. It still is not shipped would like to know whats taken so long and when are you shipping it??
5,Buy it now!!,"Very good, this new CD shows he improved a lot as a DJ. Try Tall Paul or sander kleineberg, also very good."
2,BEWARE!,"I agree with the Kishand review above. Good music (I wouldn't necessarily say great), but the ability (or lack thereof) to use on my ipod is infuriating. I sent an email to artist@christopherlawrence.com and their response was that CL didn't know about this and the record label put the protection software on. They also stated that they had some workaround for this, but I haven't received it yet to verify that. In any case, I encourage people to steer clear of this cd until they can come up with a more user friendly version."
3,Great for fans...,"If you are a huge fan of CL, you better get this album, otherwise listen to the samples first before buying.I am a huge fan of Paul van Dyk, and listening to this was a different experience. This album was more of a better-than-average trance music but nothing really stands out. Unlike some albums where artists stuff in some filler tracks, all tracks are worth listening to. But if I had to choose some highlights, I would say the track ""Halo"" is definately the best of the ablum (really reminds me of John Askew's New Dimensions).All in all, it is just another trance album that does its job."
5,awesome,"That Christopher Lawrence has done it again! CL continues to hit the mark everytime he plays in person, releases a CD or record. He pushes the marker out for all other dj's to move toward. What makes this CD awesome is that all of the cuts are his own...no remixes here. CL knows what his fans like and he produces it for us everytime...thanks, CL, you are the greatest!"
1,Great Case!,This seems to be a really nice laptop case made for HP by Targus. It's well constructed with lots of pockets for accessories as well as some space for files. It could probably stand a little more file storage space but this case would definitely serve as a good briefcase for short-term away business.
5,I'm Addicted to this Video!,"All of Carman's video's are awesome!!! I just wish they were available on DVD.This particular one, likeRevival in the Landis a combination of live performances and concept videos. It includes:1) Come Into This House - Live2) 1955 - Concept3) Our Turn Now - Concept with Petra4) Satan, Bite the Dust - Concept5) Hunger for Holiness - Live6) Addicted to Jesus - Concept with DC Talk7) Holy Ghost Hop - LiveCarman gives the back story to three of the songs as well.My favorite video on this one is definately Satan Bite the Dust, where Carman has a shoot-out with the Devil in a western saloon."
3,Jolly well rocks the house old boy!,Contains several nice rocking tracks along with a few duds. I got it used at a very reasonable price. Loaded by Numb Factory was worth the price alone.
3,"Great Jane, Mediocre Everything Else","Jane Seymour is the reason to watch this movie about love between an older woman and a younger man. She is preternaturally beautiful as usual and a great actress, but this is low-budget cheesy tearjerker stuff. Worth watching, but buy only if you are a huge Jane Seymour fan."
3,Well acted and worth watching.,"Jane Seymour is excellent as the disillusioned, eccentric pianist. I've enjoyed many of her films, but I thought this was some of her best acting."
2,worth viewing,"it's typical older woma younger guy stuff but little substance.jane is a joy to watch, such a beautiful lady !!!"
1,Please don't make your students buy this.,"This is the *worst* textbook I think I've ever read. I actually get angry just reading it. The message about the need for community counseling is fine, however, when that exact same message is repeated over and over and over in just slightly different ways, paragraph after paragraph for over 300 pages, without any really communication of theory or practice - well, it just makes you want to throw the book across the room.There's GOT to be a better textbook on the market. Please take an extra five minutes and find it."
1,Terrible textbook,Please don't use this book in the classroom. It is very disorganized and confusing to follow. It is the worst textbook I have ever had for a counseling class.
1,counseling major,"This is not a good text book. It's not even a good book book. If you're an instructor and you're thinking about using this for a class, please reconsider. It is incredibly boring, no one in my class made it through the first chapter."
3,Don't use this one to teach grammar...,"Here is a cute story, accompanied by detailed illustrations in muted tones, about a chicken wreaking havoc in dog's kitchen.The text has a strong colloquial flair and is best read aloud to get the full cadence and effect. Most obvious is the dropping of the ""g""s on most words (flicken', snackin', scratchin', etc.) which may make it difficult for beginning readers, but certainly would not affect anyone listening to the story.The ending is adorable - with baby chicks all over that make dogs heart quicken. Sweet."
4,great book the kids love it!,I checked this book out of the library to read for preschool and was flabbergasted by how much the kids looooved it! They wanted to read it every day and when I brought it home my son asked if we could read it to him before he went to bed. I looked it up on Amazon and purchased a used copy for only five dollars. It came in pretty good shape and I am glad to have it in our collection.
1,Eeewww!,"I bought this primarily for the dessert section. That was a mistake. I'm an avid baker/cook - but these recipes are horrible. You can find better recipes on the internet. And as other reviewers have said, some of the ingredients are tough to find. Luckily I live in a big city where I can find them easily, but people in other cities will have difficulty."
5,Great Compliment for Atkins Followers,"Everyone is unique and therefore believes differently --especially about the human ""diet."" For those of you who believe in a ""high-protein, low-carbohydrate philosophy,"" this little book can be an invaluable compliment to Dr. Atkins diet books. He explains from square one in his diet books why his philosophy can be healthy and helpful. I personally have had success following Dr. Atkins suggestions. From a physics sound wave perspective however, any ""diet"" will work for anyone, anytime as long as they think, feel, and believe that it will...and then all you have to do is be happy and thankful...a book has just been published explaining this very issue..."
2,"Easy, but uninspired recipes","Yes - the recipes are easy.I would reccomend this book only for a non-cook or beginner at cooking. If you thought of adding almonds to green beans or putting Splenda in gelatin recipes without this book - you don't need this book.The 'spicy' recipes are pretty tame.The book might give you some ideas, but I would suggest using the cookbooks you have and modifying some recipes to be low carb."
3,good info...not so great recipes,"I have been on the atkins diet for four months and have lost 56 pounds (and still going), so I can attest to the fact that this diet does work. I have never felt better or more energetic in my life.The first part of this book talks about the basics of the diet. That's where the three stars came from. The second part of the book is the recipe section. No stars for it. Most of the recipes call for ingredients that I cannot find in normal grocery stores. It's really quite frustrating. Unless you live in an area with several health food stores, which I do not, I would recommend trying to find a different cook book with more practical recipes or coming up with your own."
1,Save your money and go to the Web site,"I bought this cookbook before looking at the Atkins Web site. Big mistake. You can find these recipes, and in some cases updates of them, for free on the Web site. You can also find lots of low-carb recipes by searching with Google. This book also could have used the assistance of an experienced cookbook editor."
3,Wonderful principle but tricky recipes,"As one who has maintained a 60-pound weight loss for over four years and achieved optimum health thanks to Atkins diet, normally I'd expect to give ten stars to anything from Dr Atkins. Nontheless, unless one is a gourmet with a spice rack to rival that of Julia Child, most of the recipes are beyond one's reach: time consuming, intricate, and requiring much preparation time."
1,A must for CRJ majors,This book is really good and it explains criminology in a way that a normal person would understand it.
4,You get what you paid for - I am pleased!,"Before you get these earrings, please read more about diamonds. 1/3 cttw is the total carat weight of these earrings, so they ARE small. The color and clarity are not great, so they have some flaws that are visible to the eye. They still sparkle, and they look very elegant. I prefer small but real diamonds over large CZ, so it is a matter of preference. These are starter diamonds for people that want to wear real diamonds without breaking the bank. I am pleased with them. My only complaint is that these earrings did not come with a certificate of authenticity. If they were not sold by Amazon, probably I would have returned them just for that reason."
2,Nice Stones but Cheap Lose Back,I bought these for my wife for Christmas. The quality of cut was good the color acceptable for the price and any inclusions were very minimal for diamonds to be worn on the ear. However the back (Clasp) of the earring is cheaply made and lose fitting. My wife claimed that as her only concern with the gift and this proved to be prophetic as they did not last a week before one fell off her ear over the course of a day of traveling. This crucial detail turned a very satisfying purchase into a very dissatisfying one!
3,OK Quality,These earrings are OK but I was dissapointed that they only came in a little blue velvet bag instead of a box.
2,Show someone you kinda like how much you care,These are TINY. I was embarrassed to give them to a loved one. Reserve these as a gift to a mistress or someone you like but don't quite love. Definitely don't give them if your intention is to impress.
1,poor,this was the worst product i have ever gotten diamonds were smaller and the backs were so cheap i lost one of the ear ring all ready never wull buy agian from here
1,"Garbage in, Garbage out.","It's truly a shame that there is no 'zero star' choice. For it would be both a beautiful embrace of the void and the perfect commentary for 'Dark Zen' in general and this book of garbage specifically. Dark Zen is considered to be a cult by the majority of Buddhist practitioners and a joke by the remaining minority. The Dark Zen web site reads as though it was created by a 12 year old in Beaverton, OR who had just watched Star Wars, skimmed a few Zen-themed books and downed 8 Red Bull sodas (while torturing his hamster). Aside from the obvious spelling mistakes and poor grammar there is an undercurrent of racism, elitism and pretty much everything that Buddhism (in general) speaks against. Pretty much anything would be better than this book in terms of learning about Buddhism. Even Snoopy makes a better Zen master than this fake."
5,This is MGN3,I'm not sure about the other reviewers comment but I ordered this and did receive BRM4 (MGN3).
3,the information isn't enough,"it doesn't come with a CD-room. I ordered a latest edition,but the information didn't show me about that, and it didn't have a picture of the book.also, I found out I could buy one at a lower price."
5,When The Lights Go Out ( Us Version ),This song is one of the many best songs I've heard from a boy band and nevertheless...I feel strongly that Five is the best and coolest Boy Bands in the World and I should say that the Album rulez too...I just love the mystery track on their album..seeya
5,coming back 4 more rules!!!,"I love the song ""coming back for more."" it is so cool. I played it at a party and it was just jammin!!! Good song. 5ive are one of the best bands out there. Ciao."
3,Not bad,"This cd I got for free as a surprise gift when I bought a book here on amazon. When it came I gave it try. At first I thought it was so-so. However, over time I came to really appreciate it. It's really good relaxing music that's primarily played with just a guitar and a flute I believe. There are also some other instruments thrown in occasionally however they never sound out of place. Also present are some outdoorsish sound effects, like birds chirping. These sound really genuine; it made me wonder if they had actually recorded the songs outside. The only thing I didn't like about it were the song titles which to me really didn't fit the music.In any case I figure it's a good album for casual listeners who are into relaxing music. Give a try!"
5,Get connected.,"I read this book as a 20+something. After a life of growing up in a Christian home, I knew the stories, but not the PEOPLE of the Bible. This book connected me for the first time, in a very real way, to the characters of the Bible. Some of them great, others seemingly not. But all were REAL people just like me. The book flows simply, not demanding enormous thought, just listening. You get the feeling you have spent an evening listening to an old friend tell you their deepest trials and intimate thoughts. That's why a few pages is enough for days of contemplation! I finished the book feeling like Job, David, Daniel were my good friends. And it made me realize that God in ANYONE'S life is just as precious and amazing. I can't imagine my life with Him without this milestone of a book."
3,Contrary to Publication Date this is WW2 information,This is a reprint of a collection of atricles written by the Sierra Club in the ealry 1940's. While it is of interest historicaly it is not of great value for the modern ski mountaineer.
5,Worked in my Sons dorm room,The school does not allow anything that can damage the walls. I found this through my online search and it worked out great. He was able to hang all his posters and they stayed up. A good product.
2,Great talent and voices wasted on bad music.,"Roberto Alagna's presence in this production was the only reason I bought it. As usual, he was great. It is just too bad that he wasn't singing to something that sounded like music.I admit being an old coot way down in the chaparral country of Texas who just doesn't care much for opera written since Verdi, Puccini, or even Wagner. If you really like classical opera I think you might not like this production."
5,best opera on DVD this year!,"No need for a lengthy review or discussion. Alagna is at his best in this performance although his nose does take about six seconds to get used to. You will never again think of Franco Alfano as the ""man who finished Turandot."" This opera deserves to be heard, seen and performed and often! Don't delay. Buy this DVD !!"
5,Alagna is magnificent,This is a gorgeous piece of music and Alagna is heartrendingly perfect. He is a consummate performer and his voice is glorious
3,From the wife,"I got it for my husband. He is a big NY fan. He really liked The Bronx is Burning so I got him this too. He seemed to enjoy it. I thought it was OK, not as entertaining as the Bronx is Burning, but had lots of good info."
5,Great wide view,The Tokina lens arrived at noon today. I have had a ball shooting wide pictures.17th Street provided good service. I will order from them again because of their courtesy. They refuuded my shipping cost when my package arrived late.
4,Really?,I really liked this book. It was so funny to read about conspiracies and him getting caught up in it.
4,Intriguing and entertaining,This book is a fascinating look at people who are involved in conspiracy theories and extreme ideas. It is interesting to meet these people up close and to experience the world from their point of view - to discover there is some truth behind the craziness.
4,"Poignant, humorous, touching","_Them_ is not a thorough expose of popular extremist groups or conspiracy theories.This book (like so much of Ronson's work) is a character study. Or rather, a study of characters. _Them_ is a first-hand account of one man's experience with some of the people closest (in one capacity or another) to these groups. And taken as such (instead of as an encyclopedic analysis of the groups themselves), it's an absorbing read.If you're a conspiracy monger on a singular hunt for his next fix, you probably won't get much out of _Them_. But if you appreciate well-written narratives about interesting people in particular social contexts, I recommend it."
4,a nice conclusion,"well, i must say that this trilogy comes to a nice conclusion. the problem i've noticed with this trilogy is that the authors did not spend enough time character development. This is a great format to dive into the characters, but the authors didn't seem to take advantage of that. oh well, maybe next time."
2,More like a comic then a novel...,"As much as I like comics, sometimes the fast action and rushed storyline that you find in a comic make their way into novels where they do not work very well. That's the same here. Tom DeFalco must have been planning a marvel comic book story rather then a Marvel novel because here he takes the X-Men and Spider-Man, The Guardians of the Galaxy, some of the 2099 heroes, and the rest of Marvel's future heroes and puts all into one book where there is little character development and too many things happening all at once which serves only to confuse the reader as to what's really going on. The climax is boring and uneventful too!"
3,Classic skater thrash,"If this is what I think it is, this is the rerelease of Beowulf's first two albums on one disc. Beowulf were a mid-to-late-80s Cali skater/thrash metal band, similar in sound, style, and spirit to Suicidal Tendencies, but also borrowing freely (and heavily) from Motorhead. There's a lot of music here and it all starts sounding monotonous after awhile, but for the most part, the music doesn't sound too dated. Beowulf is definitely a solid second-tier band worth revisiting, but by no means essential."
3,A nice book for people working in Taylor-Couette flow,This book reports a variety of stationary solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations that model the Taylor-Couette flow viz flow of a fluid contained in the gap of two rotating cylinders. These results are mainly due to the author and her collaborators published in various journals. This book is for experts working in fluid dynamics and mathematics. For the former this is a simple set up to explore the routes to turbulence while for the latter the structure of solutions to Navier-Stokes equations as function of a parameter viz the Reynolds number. This book has definetly a place on the shelves for the above mentioned people.
3,Good book for some.,"This book was very good for those who really are having thoughts about the spiritual/emotional aspects of fasting. For me, as a first time faster, I really wanted info on the facts of fasting, i.e. how to fast, what I should do, how much should I be drinking, water drinking, etc. This book has a very short section on this towards the end, only a few pages. The rest is devoted to the positive spirtual aspects you can gain through fasting. There are also a couple of good recipes in the back. So for some it will be very informative, for me it wasn't quite what I was looking for."
5,the book I've been looking for,I purchased The Fasting Path based on reviews found on Amazon.com. I cannot say it any better than they do. I'm delighted I bought the book. This is an outstanding book -- very helpful to me.
5,Value and Quality,"When I purchased these speakers, I expected to get fairly decent computer speakers with a rear channel, and nothing more. I have used many poor quality speakers over the years, many of which costed much more than these, and hoped that these would at least outlast my previous purchases. I was taken completely by surprise by the quality of these speakers. For such a small package (and relatively low power), these things deliver strong, clean bass while still having excellent midrange quality. Loading in the Matrix DVD provided near-movie theater quality sound, and gaming became much more exciting with the ability to hear rockets flying past my head. I simply cannot endorse this product enough. If you want to break into the world of surround sound, you will not find a better value."
4,Huge bang for the buck!,"Looking at the astoundingly low price of this system, you may be a bit worried about its capabilities, but rest assured that this set sounds very good. I was swayed by the great reviews, and they are all true! I have to admit, there is some slightly weak midrange and this is certainly not audiophile quality stuff... but for playing games or watching DVDs on your computer, this is a great buy.This system is VERY loud if you want it to be. I love the desktop volume control 'remote' and the subwoofer's adjustable bass level. Compared to the harman kardon speakers that came with my system, these are much much much better.To reiterate, these are not audiophile speakers, but the bang for the buck is incredible. They really can pump out the sound."
3,HRD + TOP = WTF,"As a fan of the Hoodoos & Tower of Power I was really looking forward to a blast from the past with a big hint of the future. Unfortunately, I was disappointed with the contrived lyrics and overall lack of energy in the sides. Even the track penned by Walters & Joe Crane wasn't up to their work with the Hoodoos. Great production but it's not gonna get me up the highway. I'll still give 'em a shot but I hope the next go 'round hits the note."
2,item image as online,The item online does not any manufacturers identification on the face of the gauge.i was not expecting this to be on the item but it was not what I was looking for.
4,Work great so far,"Work very well. I did have to do a little grinding to get them to fit in the caliper, but it was pretty minor. Seem to work well so far. Using these with EBC GC7013 3GD Series Dimpled and slotter rotors. Can really tell in wet conditions that they are working."
4,A Fine Yet Uncharacteristic Offering,"One of my favorite Graham Parker albums. I especially enjoy the suite of short, topical songs that all blend together: ""Everything Goes/Sugar Gives You Energy/Daddy's A Postman/Green Monkeys"". ""Big Man On Paper"" is one of his most touching songs. This is the most pop album Graham has ever made, but for a power pop fan such as myself, that's great. Another GP album that didn't really get the attention it deserved."
5,"One of the greatest ""albums"" ever by anyone.","This is one of the CDs that I have played most in my life. A perfect mix of Chairman Parker's wit (caustic and otherwise), sing-along melody, empathy, love, soul."
2,Overpriced toy that doesn't do a whole lot!,"My daughter asked for this at Christmas and I ordered it! It is a total dissapointment! The doll only sings two lines of the song, my daughter expected it to sing the whole song! So it basically is boring to her after about 15 minutes of play time! Not worth the huge price in my opinion!"
1,Poor manufacturing of Hannah Montana doll,"My girls love Hannah Montana and as parents, her show is OK with us. We bought the doll knowing the girls would be too excited at Christmas. Well, one doll worked that morning but the other didn't so we switched batteries to check and then it worked. We bought new batteries, which are expensive by the way at $5 each and the doll needs 4. Now, the doll that worked initially, isn't working correctly - you have to squeeze her middle and back tight to keep the battery connection - and the one that didn't work, works only partially now. It sings about 1 line. I will be writing the manufacturer. Who knows, maybe we'll get something out of it. At least the girls still get enjoyment pretending and playing with the dolls."
3,ok doll,This doll plays a hannah montana song which is cool but it only plays about three seconds of the song. After awhile my dauhgter lost interest. For the price should played at least half the song.
3,Should Have Waited,Not knowing the availability in my area for this toy I paid over $34.00 here and then found the exact same doll at wally world for under $20.00. Live and learn.
1,Boring and slow,I didn't even finish the movie. It was slow and boring. Thats all I can say about it as there wasn't one thing I liked about it.
5,Don't watch hungry,"If you don't enjoy chinese cuisine, you will after watching this movie. This is a wonderful story of a father and his daughters learning to cope with life and each other. Much of the drama centers around the traditional Sunday dinner which, though the day or country may change, is a rather universal experience. The stories of the various family members are wonderful and the cooking scenes magical. This DVD also includes footage of the director discussing the movie which is fun.Next to Tempopo, this is the best movie about Asian cuisine."
3,tortilla soup kicks this can to the curb,"after having seen 'tortilla soup', i had to see the original; well, i should have stood in bed (as my gran used to say). this flick is V E R Y chinese: slow, detailed, beautiful, but lacking visceral punch. if you want a REALLY fun flick experience, watch 'tortilla soup'; if you want a cerebral exercise in chinese family dysfunction, watch this flick."
2,Eat Drink Man Woman,"This is an excellent story well told in script and action. However, it is quite different from the version I saw on a big theater screen. This DVD has speeded up the action and the English translation dialogue is presented in such rapid changes that it is virtually impossible to read and follow the dialogue. I was very disapointed in this DVD version and would not recommend it to friends."
5,See hear laugh cry,"Master Chu (Sihung Lung) is a semi-retired chef living with his three unmarried daughters (Kuei-Mei Yang, Chien-Lien Wu, and Yu-Wen Wang). This wonderful film spans the period of their lives that sees a number of significant changes in the lives of the family members. Although family relations are often strained, they always come together around a sumptuous Sunday dinner prepared by Chu. Throughout the film, these dinners are punctuated by formal announcements by the daughters that herald major changes for everyone. At the end of the film, Chu himself has an announcement that no one expects.Many factors combine to make this such a wonderful film. In addition to the talented cast, director Ang Lee gives us a rich feel for the texture of life in modern Taiwan as well as gorgeously shot cooking sequences that will have you rushing to the refrigerator (or the nearest Chinese resteraunt). Highly recommended."
3,GREAT EATS,"YEARS AGO I SAW THIS MOVIE AND AS A FOODIE HAD IT STORED IN THE FOREFRONT ALONG W/ GREAT MEMORIESOF GREAT FOOD. SO, I JUST HAD TO HAVE IT JUST TO WATCH A MASTER COOK, COOK.....K.D. SOUTHERN CAL"
5,"Eat Drink Man Woman has humor, wisdom, and grace.","Eat Drink Man Woman is full of humor, wisdom, and grace. I love to watch this film. I always suggest that you eat a full meal before you watch this motion picture. The savory dishes created by the father who is a chef in a major hotel in Taipei, Taiwan makes your mouth water and your glands salivate. I want to be in this film and enjoy a meal with the master chef. You will laugh and notice the wisdom of this wonderful motion picture. I only wonder what it would be like if I understood Mandarin. I get a lot of meaning with the subtitles. I am used to subtitles, however, I bet their were a few nuances that I missed."
1,Disappointed,"I ordered and received this DVD. It was supposed to have English Sub-titles. It even said that it did. I arranged to send it back to get one that did have the sub-titles. I asked the Amazon person if there was a way to be sure that the new one had them. She said that they could not, but would send the new one. It came and was exactly the same as the first, no sub-titles. It was all Chinese language. I did not want to go through the hassle of asking for a third one. I gave it as a gift to one of my Chinese friends. I was disappointed that I did not end up with the DVD."
2,Only for Foodies,"If you've seen Tortilla Soup, there is no need to watch this movie. This is just the Chinese version of the said movie. The similarities of these 2 movies are so prominent that it would actually be a waste of time and money to buy both - same characters, same plot only in a different setting.I got to enjoy the scenes with food, though..."
1,Unimpressed,This was what I've been curious about for oh so many years? This made Ang Lee hot? The acting sucks. The pace is slow. The plot is contrived. It doesn't even have a second of nudity. So much for not being rated. It's like Taiwan - boring. I only give it one star because that's the lowest.
2,Eat Drink Man Woman DVD,[ASIN:B00005JKG1 Eat Drink Man Woman] The DVD copy of this otherwise excellent movie was of very bad quality. The resolution of the picture was low so the picture looked out of focus. The picture colours were redish and the picture was also shaky in some places. Total lost of time and money.
5,Eat Drink Man Woman,"One of my favorite movies. Understated but packed with emotion. Poinant, funny and great acting. A must see"
4,Simply lovely and sweet. Chinese with subtitles,"A widowed chef father and his adult children all of whom seem to have lost their taste for life, find their new paths. They rediscover their closeness as they move on. Several twists keep one's interest. If only aromas were part of the film."
5,Charming Lovely Film About Food and Love,"This is one of Ang Lee's early films and I personally think many of them are better. In Taiwan, a widower with 3 daughters struggle with life and pending retirement by finding love. His daughters are looking for love themselves and everyone loves good cooking. A film about love and food that is a prize winning mini masterpiece. A very nice film."
5,Amazing and Unique,"From the start, this movie is bound to spark interest. The amazing beginning definitly caught my curiosity with its splenidid cooking scenario. It has a great story filled with many twists that will keep you second guessing as well as salivating. A movie unique to non- asian, which is well done and left me craving for more."
3,Great Movie but...,"One of my favorite movies from Asia. I am glad to see a DVD of this great food flick finally released. Very sparse on the extras, but there is an ok interview of Ang Lee on it.My only beef is that there are no Chinese subtitles! I would have given it four stars, but the constant lack of Chinese subtitles in these DVDs is starting to irritate me. Thus I knocked a star off."
4,great resource,"This publication may have been designed for children, but we have found it a great tool for our adult education group, and I was glad to get this copy for our library. The art work is creative and lovely, and the presentation of information is solid and creative as well.Great resurce.Gerry"
2,An opportunity missed,What looks like one of the few good non-supertitious explanations available to young readers turns out to be a gaia-infused sloppy mish-mash of facts and (unfortunately) somewhat uncritical folklore written by authors probably lost somewhere between science and crystal-gazing.Still has some value if your intention is to read this to your kids while filtering fact from fiction. The graphics are probably useful for children.
4,Where did I come from?,"Told as if the Universe has patted her lap & invited to you up for grand story, she takes you back into a time before time, when the Earth was formed, long, long before you or I were motes in the storm. Long before dinosaurs were born & flowers grew.Told in a confidential, amusing & lyrical turn of phrase, FROM LAVA TO LIFE spills the beans on how life began here from microscopic cells in a churning brew of chemicals as our raw orb rolled around the heavens.Fascinating images! Dana Lynn Andersen captures our imagination with her broad strokes of things bigger & smaller than one pair of eyes can see. Jennifer Morgan's sense of humor is both reverential & irreverent, charming & instructive.If you are stumped when your kids ask the oldest of questions: ""Where did I come from?"" Then FROM LAVA TO LIFE & its prequel BORN WITH A BANG are for you!"
5,"my daughter loves this book, and so do i!","i was a little unsure about getting a book that made the universe a consciousness being. but i have to say that the way in which this book, and the first in the series, are written is very easy to read, and very easy to understand. some books in this genre are harder to read, because they are more like text books with words. this book flows smoothly, and reads like a story book, and keeps my daughters interest the whole way through. my daughter is always asking me to ""read the universe story"" and ""read the lava book!"" i have not purchased the 3rd in the series, but after reading the first 2, i will definitely be purchasing this author's take on evolution!"
4,"Great book, but difficult","John Jr (below) obviously has a little chip on his shoulder about writing theory and probably about academia.No, this is not a how-to book filled with exercises and tips and explanations of different techniques. It is a book for the advanced student or writer, and discusses issues involved with the short story, placing the form in assorted contexts and dissecting it from those positions. It is not easy reading, but neither is it impregnable to the thoughtful reader. It will not tell you how to write short stories, but it will provide you with intelligent ways of thinking about them, and hence, being more disciplined and perhaps original in your work."
3,Basic Primer,"For someone looking for a brief timeline of Scottish spiritual history, this book might fit the bill. The theology was weak and the final conclusion of the book even weaker, but the middle slice of the book gave a succinct synopsis of Scotland's spiritual journey from settlement to contemporary times and might serve to satisfy someone just beginning to research the topic."
5,Rolling Stones best video ever.,"Shows the Stones at their absolute best without all the frills. In fact, this has to be the best ever Stones concert ever recorded."
2,The Rolling Stones: Some Girls- LIve in Texas 78 Blu Ray- Quality is Poor,"This is an very good concert of the Rolling Stones, but the problem, is that it was recorded back in 1978, and when converted to Blu Ray, just not that good! You would be better off just getting a regular DVD!"
3,Could have Been Better!,"Some Girls is an excellent concert in terms of execution, song selection and in audio quality. This 1978 concert in Dallas Texas includes Bill Wyman on bass guitar.This is the Rolling Stones without much extra help on stage- no horns. But for a blu ray disc this release is unimpressive and you may as well buy the DVD version (if the audio on that one is equally good).Why did the Stones bring this blu ray disc on the market when BRIDGES TO BABYLON (with Joshua Redman on saxophone) remains unreleased in blu ray? That- with DTS multichannel audio- is the one I'm waiting for."
2,All my favorite Rolling Stone songs are here!!,"I knew the video would be lacking from the other reviewers' ratings, but come on Mick.....learn the words to your own songs and stop making the words up!! I was hoping for a far better sounding mix that what I actually heard!"
4,Rollings Stones 1978 Texas Tour,"Very good concert! I saw this very same concert in Cleveland,Oh in 1978,when I was 17 years old! It brought back a lot of great memories!The concert was shot in 16mm film,but for the day,it's pretty good.Great set list and high Stones energy round this DVD Out nicely.......I recommend it for all Stones fans!"
5,Truly Great,"Just saw this in the theatre and it is superb. This is the Stones coming off the matt and fighting for their title -- and we all know which title I'm talking 'bout. Five original Stones (Ian Stewart included) plus two former Faces, Keith and Charlie actually looking young, Mick moving into his camp phase with Ronnie as his primary foil. Tremendous. I can't believe they'd ever play any better than this. I'd love to hear this on CD (not the bootleg), and I'm definitely preordering."
5,FANTASTIC!,"The Stones at their peak! What more can you say, if you never had a chance to see the Stones in the 70's this is it! Also the bonus sections' are fantastic, SNL and interviews with Mick, Keith, & even a little Charlie and Bill, then and now! Very Happy with this purchase!"
4,Stones - Some Girls,When was the last time Ronnie Wood actually played his guitar? Some Girls answers the question. An excellent concert from one of the greats - the Stones.
3,Not quite there,"Many of the previous reviews have it right, so I will be brief. The show is good not great. Keith is going half speed and Ronnie's guitar work is a little shrill. There is waaaaay too much Mick, even during the guitar solos. ""Ladies and Gentlemen"" is tighter with more intensity. Just sayin'."
3,It's OK,"Sorry, but I still think the concerts at Madison Square Garden in 1969 are unsurpassed. They were still extremely good in 1978, but the disco-era and partying had taken its toll.The hard R&B; rocking had been replaced with a more 80's-like beat. The song ""Miss You"" has never sounded good live."
5,The second Best live concert from the Rolling Stones !!!,"The first is from Dec 11, 1968 ""Rock -n- Roll Circus"" if you don't have this one, get it alot of history on it. As far as ""Some Girls live from Texas in '78"" had me feet tapping through out the film. The audio & video are excellent. I've seen basically all of the Stones concerts and these two stand out and are must have, if your a Stones fan.Derek"
5,Excellent Scale,"I've had this scale for about 3 months now, and it works perfectly every time. I like the fact that it's easy to switch between grams and ounces, and you can put a heavy plate on it, zero it out, and just weigh what you put on the plate. I got it because I started counting calories to lose weight. It's been great, and I've lost 22 pounds so far by ""doing the math."""
5,long time favorite,"I've had this recording for years and have went through vinyl, cassettes, and at least 2 CDs and now MP3s. Same for Come On Joe . This man can wring more emotion out of his voice than anyone else I've ever heard . I don't classify music styles , but my taste runs from classical to hard rock ....either I like it or I don't . I'll Never Get Over You and Walls are my faves ...wish I could find them in videos . Someone described these recordings as a fusion of cajun ,country , and rock . I wish he would do lots more ! I've had people ask me what is playing on my car stereo !"
5,Excellent Binoculars for the Price,"I'm no expert on binoculars like a lot of reviewers, but am very happy with this pair. When reading reviews on other pairs, a lot of reviewers complained of blurriness or lack of clarity for closer objects. This pair is crisp at all distances, including objects only 20 feet away like bird feeders. I upgraded to this pair from a pair of 7x35 binoculars, and the increase in zoom is well worth it. The binoculars also have a nice, clean look to them and have a soft rubber grip. The picture doesn't do it justice, but they look and feel like a more expensive pair."
3,Destiny's Child Lite,"All Saints started getting notice in the U.S. around 1998 when ""Never Ever"" was big, but they were also easily compared to Spice Girls. After that it seemed like both groups were trying to outdo each other, but soon they both broke up. Well, All Saints got back together back in 2006 and released their third studio album, Studio 1.The reason why I'm now comparing the ladies to Destiny's Child is because this album feels like DC's The Writing's on the Wall in that there are a lot of songs about trifling men. But the problem here is that the lyrics aren't that exciting. ""Not Eazy"" and ""Scar"" are skippable, ""Too Nasty"" is hard to relate to, and ""Hell No"" took the words right out of my mouth.The only song really worth hearing on here is ""On and On"". And ""Fundamental"" is passable. I doubt All Saints will gain any new fans with Studio 1, and given that it wasn't released in the U.S. anyway, you can probably do without it.Anthony Rupert"
4,Pretty Good,"I heard one song on the radio and bought the album (at import prices!). I enjoy about half of the album, others aren't too bad either. If you like rocksteady, you are going to enjoy the album!"
5,Bolivian Baroque CD,"If you like baroque music, it's a delight to hear this unexpected music from South America.Good quality soundThe DVD is interesting in filling in details of the history, the area and how the CD was produced."
5,great purchase!,"This was a great purchase, I listen to the cds all the time especially the live album. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys listening to The Knife."
2,Maybe i missed something.........,"What gives? This album is far from spectacular. The only thing that keeps this album from receiving a 1 star rating is the fact it fails to annoy. But on that same token it fails to stimulate on any level higher than elevator music. This is another massivly overrated album from a pretty poor year in music that was 2006. Don't get me wrong, i enjoy experimental music as long as it has some stimulating value (i.e. sonicly creative, foot tapping beats, or emotionaly deep). I fail to make any connection with this cd, on any level."
5,GREAT Record!,One of the most interesting records ever produced. Experimental and haunting.In a few words: it takes risks. And it succeeds.
5,Far from a Silent Shout!,"A bomb of electronic dark beats and crazy lyrics detonated by the mysterious swedish siblings, Olof and Karin Dreijer. Love it!"
4,Aircraft of the Chaco War 1928-1935 by Dan Hagedorn & Antonio L. Sapienza,"This is an excellent book for anyone interested in the aircraft used by both Bolivia and Paraguay during their war over the Chaco Boreal (or Grand Chaco), a conflict fought over what was then thought to be rich mineral and oil deposits... things don't change much!Given the various nationalities involved as ""mercenaries"" for both belligerents, the conflict could be viewed together with the later Second Italo-Abyssinian War and the Spanish Civil War as a prelude to World War II in Europe/Africa/Middle East.The book is well illustrated with black & white `photos of the aircraft used by the two air-forces, and details about operations that each participated in. There's even a potted history of the conflict to give the reader an understanding of what went on in this little known conflict.Jon. E. DUGGAN... Sydney NSW, AustraliaAircraft of the Chaco War 1928-1935"
2,"Nice pictures, little information","This small (i.e., thin) book was a bit disappointing. It does have some very nice photos, but I was disappointed in the lack of textual content. For some of the images there was little or no useful information. If you are just interested in seeing pictures of a variety of old figure heads the book is fine. As someone interested in the history of ship bow figures I found the limited amount of detailed content disappointing."
1,the east hampton cookbook of menus and recipes,"the cookbook is very bland nothing to make you think it was representaive of east hampton. ms. spear did nothing but assmble some recipes, it lacks local color and a personal touch."
3,Even Dragon Ball GT (uncut) is still like Pokemon,"What I mean by compairing it to Pokemon is the animation is no-way near mature looking like the early DBZ episodes. The fighting is so wack this might as well a anime from 4kids studios.About Dragon Ball GT, long ago a race known as the Tuggles were invaded and destroyed by a conquering Saiyan army. The Tuggles were thought to be extinct, but before their annihilation, they found a way to preserve a single soul, that soul has now become a powerful mutant named baby (what an odd name). He can control other bodies."
4,British Invasion,"Seachers, one of the 60s bands and at par with The Beatles, Kinks, Hollies and the rest of the gangs. I really love their music most likely that ballad 'Till I Met You'. This song is the 'B' side of 'Goodbye My love' (if i'm not mistaken). At last i found this song in this 2 cd collection. 'Needles and Pins', 'When You Walk in The Room' (also recorded by Del Shannon); 'Four Strong Winds' (also recorded by Neil Young); 'A Tear Fell' (popularized by late 50s star Teresa Brewer); etc. are now part of my collection.Sound is still a good one only lacking that deep bass found on most recordings today. Price of this 2 cd is reasonable and worth buying."
4,Reminiscent,"It is so delightful to hear again the wonderful sounds of this group. As a teenager, they were among the top performers of my favourite's list. It's just ""nice"" to be able to listen to pleasant, non-raucous vocalists. Maybe I'm just too old!! Thanks Noelene"
5,Great for beginning musicians,This book is very helpful for beginning musicians. I've been using this book for a few months and sometimes actually sound like I can play the piano. But seriously I would recommend this to anyone including people who are self taught musicians like myself.The only con is that it would be helpful if it were in a wire bound format. Great resource.
5,Great Resource,"Being that I am just a basic keyboardist who likes to play chords and melodies, this was perfect. Keeps things easy and I can embellish as much as I want. I needed a resource for church offertories and such. This has worked great. If singing is added I sometimes have to transpose but that is not so bad. Highly recommend it."
5,Revealing the Mystery,"Demetra George has done it for me in this book.I couldn't put it down.I was absolutely intrigued with her theory on why the godess disappeared,and what impact it had on our lives and the changes we needed to face.She talks about the skills we needed to develop ,in order to cope without her presence in our lives.After each chapter she gives the reader challenging questions to consider and I felt myself reconsider the myth I was holding about patriarchy and the essence of what it was meant to be.A great book for your women and men friends for christmas,who always have had in interest in the moon,astrology,anthropology,history and godesses."
2,term paper,"I bought this book after reading all the glowing reviews. It read like a term paper to me. It describes a number of myths in a more or less engaging style, and incorporates a very interesting section on the overlap of astrological, historical, and cosmic lunar cycles, but the author fails to get past description to insight and meaning. She cycles around to the same two or three conclusions about the three part goddess and patriarchy, again and again, without ever saying anything I haven't heard elsewhere. There is, however, an extensive biography of her sources, which should make a good reading list."
5,A Jewel,"Truly a gem of a book. Inspiring, informative.... very well written. Not full of hocus pocus like many new age books of today. She does not force an opinion or belief upon the reader. It has been a wonderful reconnection for me spend time with the Dark Goddess and listen to her wisdom. I loved reading this book. Thank you Demetra George for the wisdom in this truly wonderful book."
1,"Innacurate mythology, revisionist history","While Ms. George does have some useful things to say about dark moon mysteries, it would be more interesting and engaging (and less likely to have readers throwing the book against the wall) if she did not use revisionist history and inaccurate mythology to support her conclusions. I can think of better books on the subject."
4,"This is similar to ""I Spy"" series, VERY COOL books!","Great Book for ages KG & up. VERY COLORFUL, captures your eyes attention for sure. GREAT PHOTOGRAPHY. Search & Solve puzzles that I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND."
4,Fun,A little difficult for 5 and 7 year old granddaughters to find everything in pictures but definitely kept their attention.
5,night before christmas,This book gets read by my daughter and I every night! she asks for it and wants to finish- I even used it to come down her four year old dance class waiting to go on stage.
4,addictive!!,"I was at a winery when I first came across these chocolate coated bits of yummy goodness- they had free samples at the checkout counter. I tried them-- and loved them!! HIGHLY addictive little boogers!!Imagine my joy (and the death of my diet) when I found you could purchase them by the POUND!! My purchase transaction was smooth, I received the seeds unmelted (even in the middle of summer). My only complaint is they tasted a bit stale to me, as though they used old seeds or these had been sitting around for a while."
1,Terrible Taste,"This product is a disappointment. There was more of a candy coating than sunflower seed and the candy was not tasty at all. It had a stale and smoky quality to it that I did not expect and I could not find one person that tried them who liked the taste at all. The best part of these, unfortunately, is their look and vibrant colors - that's about it."
5,DELICIOUS,"sunflower seeds are my favorite snack. These seeds with the chocolate and candy covering are beyond divine. I am sharing them this time, but the next time is all for me"
3,Very old performance,Enjoyable if you love this artist. Not exactly what you would expect from a performance today. da da da da
3,Night of Rapture/Rapture Live ?,"I have a dvd that's called ""A NIGHT OF RAPTURE"". Reading the reviews of Rapture Live, it sounds like the one I have. Poor quality, color very washed out. Is A NIGHT OF RAPTURE different? I'm confused. I've seen her twice (the same tour), and would love to see a quality DVD that would live up to Mrs. Baker's own standards.Robert"
4,Fast paced and intelligent,I had never read any of Peter Robinson's previous books and didn't really know what to expect. Well there were really 'No worries'. The book moves crisply filling in the gaps of the story in a intelligent way and creating a interesting read. I really enjoyed the character of 'Inspecter Alan Banks' a complex and enjoyble creation. Plus he's a very good detective...
3,Not as good as the others,In this novel things are not as they seem. Inspector Banks is sent to investigate a beating death outside of the English pub areas. Everything seems cut and dried at first since the victim was a renowned racist who was seen arguing with a group of Pakistani youths. If it were that simple there would not be a novel.The book focuses on hatred and drug dealing. Inspector Banks is having major personal problems that at times might hinder his investigation. This is my second Inspector Banks novel (PAST REASON HATED being first). I intend to continue reading the series because I have heard many positive things about the character in other novels. This book was good but not as good as the one I previously read.
3,Good Book But Petered Out at the End,"Peter Robinson always writes a fine novel: good pacing, well-developed characters, a plot which moves steadily and capably toward its denouement. And this one is no exception although the ending was, in my estimation, disappointing. But up until that point, Robinson lays out for us a feast -- or at least a nice lunch. He takes his characters, especially Detective Chief Inspector Alan Banks, through no small amount of emotional travail, which gives the book added poignancy. But the ending was weak in that ...well, you'll just have to see. I've read all Robinson's Banks books and this is a good one, just not one of his best."
3,"Too many side plots, not enough of a whodunnit.","This is far from being a favorite among british detective novels. Too much space devoted to side plots, not enough of the whodunnit quality. Definitely not is the same class with Christie, Sayers, Dickson Carr, Elizabeth George,Ruth Rendell, and such.Ray"
3,A very fine mystery,"It started slow but eventually picked up speed. DCI Alan Banks and DC Susan Gray are mired what seems to be a racially motivated murder. The brutally beaten victim is a member of a neo-Nazi group and three Pakistanis had an altercation with the victim in the local pub before he died. As Banks and Gray explore the neo-Nazi group in Eastvale and Leeds, their social lives take divergent paths. While Banks and his wife are growing apart, ultimately leading to separation, Susan Gray is starting to date again. With his love of classical music and devotion to work, Banks is a ubiquitous, amiable character."
3,So very average,"I've heard a lot about this series and how fantastic it is. I'm just going to assume I started with a not-so-sizzling entry. It started with a lot of potential, but never recaptured the promise of the first chapter. I kept waiting and waiting for the story to pick up again and it never really did. While it's not a bad book, it certainly didn't stick out as a particularly good one either. If I come across this author again, I hope I land one of the titles that has made Insp. Banks famous."
4,Good Flick from Outta the Blue,"This very small comedy/tragedy/slice of life was tossed into cable rotation... after noticing that, without thinking, I had flipped it on to run again for the THIRD TIME, it occurred to me that I must really like it! Huh. Snuck up on me.Gotta hand it to first-timer Scott Caan: not only does he do a good acting job here, but he has written this story in such a way that, although there are no big action scenes (keeping the budget tight) the excellent dialogue is punctuated with enough events (usually both violent and funny) that the movie flows nicely from front to back. Rates comparison to the much-bigger-budget ""Good Will Hunting"".Shawn Hatosy is as strong as ever in the lead, and for the first time in a long time, I really enjoyed Jeff Goldblum here. A suprisingly good little flick."
3,It's just OK,I am a huge Scott Caan fan but this movie leasves something to be desired. Although I thought Jeff Goldblum was great.
5,Dont listen to that bad review,This is gorgeous and more so in person! does take awhile to put togetherLoved it so much I came back for a second!!!
2,Not a good dictionary,The words are written in their native script so it is very hard to find if you do not know how to read malayalam.
3,Fast paced but not really believable,"This book was ok, but suffered from believability. Not that a book about a rampaging, murdering sasquatch doesn't already stretch those bounds. But it's a horror/suspense story so you go with it. The part I couldn't get past was when the three main protagonists go into the mountains after the creature. They know it's a killer, yet only one of them is armed, and with just a pistol at that! Wouldn't common sense tell you to be armed to the teeth? The part where the pretty TV reporter meets her doom is also a bit over the top, and I don't think the grisliness of the details added to the story. On the positive side, Shadowkiller was a page turner, and I did enjoy it, like a B horror movie."
4,The Shadow Killer,"Well, I liked this book. Yes, the subject matter is a bit silly: a 1400 pound, 11 foot sasquatch (with an intelligent, but limited, mind) running all over the place killing people for revenge. Kinda goofy, I agree. But the author wove a pretty good story and developed the characters pretty well. There were lots of characters in the book to keep up with but they all came together to make the story flow. I was really disappointed in one character, Ben. He's an old Indian who has the ability to ""communicate"" with the creature mentally. He could have added much to the story if this telepathy concept had been fully developed. But sadly, it wasn't. That was disappointing. But the rest of the book was okay. The dust cover says it will make you think twice before going camping again. Hardly.I think this is Matthew Scott Hansens first novel. He certainly has potential. He wove a good story."
5,Great Read,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It has all the elements of a good read. Mystery, drama, love, sadness,action and of course, the main character that the whole story centers around - Bigfoot. I could identify with the characters to the point where there was one I could not stand! (read it, you will see who that is!) I enjoy stories like this. It was a steady build to the climax and I was hooked after the first few paragraphs. If you enjoy these kind of stories, you will love this book.Debbie C, OH"
2,Decent story with terrible characters,"I liked the concept of the story. Bigfoot goes on a rampage and kills a bunch of people. Pure brain candy. But all the characters (including the big guy) were ridiculously bad. Mac, the dumb and incompetent cop. Kris, the super evil reporter. Carillo, the dumb cop's dumber partner. Ty, the suicidal crackpot. Ben, the native american caricature. Even though the creature was homicidal, he was probably the most interesting. You almost want him to win."
3,Review of the Shadowkiller,"This is a good ""beach"" read. The story carries you along with plenty of twists and turns to keep it interesting. I highly recommend you read the afterword first. That will make it more believable. Frankly, I didn't find it very scarey because the creature didn't seem real to me. But hey, it's his first novel and it's not bad."
4,David Pitt is misinformed.,"Reviewer David Pitt is dreadfully misinformed and misguided in his review of this novel. It is a very interesting and well written book reminiscent of the novels of Michael Critchton and Stephen King. Additionally, the Patterson-Gimlin film of 1967 has never actually been exposed as a hoax, although there are some people in Hollywood who claim it is, and the special effects man they supposed was responsible for hoaxing it has on several occasions very clearly stated that he did NOT. His exact words were, ""I'm good, but not THAT good."" Nonbelievers always convieniently overlook this fact. The film may very well be real, and bigfoot may very well be real as well. However, there has never been a case like the one presented in this story, since these creatures are by most accounts very peaceful and shy. It's an interesting read, and I highly recommend it."
5,this book is not just for children,"I have a 1943 edition of The Little Prince, hard-cover and illustratred. I am unable to add to others comments--except--there is a preface by the author in which he states: "" I ask the indulgence of children who may read this book for dedicating it to a grown-up."" He goes on to say that it is his best friend, and he gives many other reasons. He dedicates it to Leon Werth. (He writes this as poetically as he writes the book. Just thought all who assume it is a childrens book wouldf lke to know that."
5,The Best Patriotic Children's Book I've Seen Yet,"Most patriotic children's books get sappy or trite ... but not this one. The words are merely the lyrics of the great song. However, the illustrations that bring those words to life create a wonderful, colorful celebration of our country, without being overly sentimental. They are so well done they stir up feelings nonetheless. When you turn the page to the fireworks over The Statue of Liberty, goosebumps are guaranteed. My kids loved the family trip across the U.S. This is Lynn Munsinger at her best! I highly recommend this book over any other I've ever seen."
5,An Appropriate Children's Book for post-9/11,"What a wonderful adaptation for the younger child. The illustrations are precious, and my daughter was truly able to understand the ""trip across America."""
4,A journey through the boxing world of the 90s.,"A nicely written account of the author's personal journey through boxing in the 90s. The author vividly describes his encounters with some of the big names in the sport: Oscar De La Hoya, Mike Tyson, Evander Holyfield, Roy Jones, Jr. and especially, James Toney. What's interesting about these sections of the book is that McRae really seems to get to know the people he's writing about and is able to reveal sides of their characters that aren't normally seen. I read this over a weekend, neglecting everything else I had planned to do because I couldn't put it down."
5,Boxing - as it is,"I could not put down this book. Somehow, McRae has turned some of the most fearsome men in the world into pussycats. How he could make James Toney et al sympathetic characters is beyond me. I am a sports fan, but I believe this is a book that can be read and enjoyed by all."
2,The slightest scratching of the surface of this complex art.,"This tape wastes too much time comparing Hsing-I to wood carving. The depictions of self defense situations were very rudimentary and had no free sparring at all, giving no feel for the flow of how this martial art works. Good detailed explanations of individual strikes and parries."
3,Addendum to my review,"I had an intermittment problem where the print server would lock up. I would need to power cycle the router to fix this. Spoke with tech support last night and they had me download the firmware from the D-Link website and reinstall,even though its the same version as what was shipped. Did not work. I then had D-Link exchange my unit. Major hassle to do the exchange. Still have interimitent problem with print server locking up which requires reboot of router. Wireless connection also freezes up from time to time. Overall,not reliable."
4,Good but WEP problem intermittent,Works fine but from time to time the WEP encryption does not work between router and my wireless Linksys card and I need to disable WEP.
4,Excellent Product,"Great Product however, to use the serial and printer ports you need to hang onto the cd.. Very frustrating from time to time.."
4,"""Screamers"" not a fool-proof recipe","Take it from a fool. :) This book is fantastic. It is a great step by step tutorial on making your own monster, with great ideas for personalizing. The only reservations I have are in regard to scale, materials, and maybe some trouble shooting advice. Specifically, the simple screamer is roughly the size of a three year old child; some steps may need to be rearranged for more complex Screamers; and casting resin is hard to find, and difficult to use (I ended up using an acrylic deck sealant for drool). Beyond these minor reservations, however, the book is an absolute gem. Buy 20 copies NOW!"
2,screamer review,"Book was in bad shape- taped together. Also, I don't understand how you can charge twice as much as the original price. Is it rare or out of print?"
5,The fun never ends...,"I am currently a freshman in college, but I was introduced to screamers through my 5th grade teacher. I've been making them ever since. The better you get at making them, the more variations you can do. The fun never ends. Buy this book now, and you won't regret it. If you are an art teacher or a 5th or 6th grade teacher, I wouldn't pass up this chance."
5,Affirming and Helpful to Survivors,"Not every chapter supports the reality of satanic ritual abuse, but overall, the book is very helpful and affirming, tastefully and sensitively written, and a great addition to any genuine life-student's library."
4,Should be titled differently,"It is an excellent story book indeed but it should have been titled something like ""The Ramayan"". I bought it to introduce my child to the festival . Most of the book depicts the Ramayan and there is very little about Diwali as such. I guess it is a challanging task to write a book about Diwali without mentioning Ramayan. The illustrations are very pleasing to the eye and are proportionate to the text contained on each page. This should make it easier for early readers to keep the interest as they read. There is a page on how it is celebrated currently, it would have been more interesting to have some more illustrations to support that. I certainly recommend it to anyone interested."
3,"Not what I expected, but a decent version of a classic story from the Ramayana.","This book is decently written, but isn't what I expected. I purchased it in preparation for a Diwali party with friends (to educate our kids about the holiday) and for a Diwali celebration at my daughter's school.This book mostly focuses on the tale from the Ramayana about the kidnapping of Sita by the the demon Ravana, and her subsequent rescue by Rama. The celebration that follows is said to be the origin of the holiday of Diwali.I'm a big fan of the Ramayana, but I would have liked a little more on Diwali to complement the storyline. As it was, there wasn't much about the traditions of celebrating Diwali. For that, I prefer Lighting a Lamp: A Diwali Story (Festival Time), by Zucker. For lots of details about the holiday and some nice photographs, I recommend Holidays Around the World: Celebrate Diwali, by Deborah Heiligman."
5,Search-unfriendly title for a lovely book,"I wonder why the publisher chose to spell the well-known festival as Divaali in the title - a spelling I have never seen before, even if it may be phonetically correct. The festival is commonly spelled as Diwali or Deepavali, and I suspect it would have sold far more copies online with one of those spellings in the title. As it is, I ran across this book only in 2009, while I have been looking and shopping for Diwali books since 2002, when this book was published!The text is well constructed, and the illustrations are sweeping and gorgeous, full of eye-pleasing and authentic details. The choice of a digital, Disneyfied style for these illustrations is unfortunate, because the book could have been a timeless treasure otherwise. On the other hand, perhaps this will help its appeal to American kids."
2,Great book but contains many grammatical errors,"I purchased this book with the hope of sharing bedtime stories of indian tales and mythology to my young daughter just as my parents had with me. The book does a great job of explaining the story in a format that can be easily understood and appreciated by young minds and the colorful illustrations are wonderful. However, I was VERY disappointed to see a large number of grammatical errors in the book. It appears that the book has not been edited at all and a number of basic errors such as fragmented sentences, run on sentences etc were missed. I am hardly an english major and normally do not pay close attention to such details, but it was very difficult to ignore the basic errors in this book. I am reluctant to have my child (who is learning to read and write herself) read this book as I fear it sets a poor example of of good grammar."
5,Essential introduction to advanced media theory,"I understand where the other reviewer is coming from; perhaps this book's title is slightly misleading. From the perspective of media theory though, this book is a revelation. Cubitt focuses on video (a dense network of various practices and forms) in order to highlight the inability of art history, film theory, or sociology and anthropology to come up with a comprehensive understanding of media.This is an academic book intended for an audience versed in the aforementioned disciplines, or at least comfortable with academic texts.Man, I sound like a pompous jerk. I just love this book, and didn't know how to say the above without over-explaining. If you like this book, check out Cubitt's Simulation and Social Theory."
1,Not a very good introduction to video in art and culture,"I find this book the worst place to start when wanting to read about art and video culture.Apart from not being particulalry insightful about video and art, whether it is because it was written such a long time ago, the author gives long, tedious accounts of the history of art, music, and film in the 20th century, and doesn't really tackle the issue of the impact of video media on art and culture.Not recommended."
4,an OKAY smoke box is better than NO smoke box,"Not to sound like a bad NFL coach post-game press conference cliche, but this smoke box ""is what it is."" It does it's job as a cheap smoke box, imparting added flavor to items you're slow cooking on your gas or coal grill. For true smoked meat flavor, you're better off buying a full-on, high-quality ceramic meat smoker, which can be purchased for upwards of $175.For the price, this is a pretty decent tool to add to your BBQ utility belt."
1,"Too small, not the European style smoker box","My bad for not checking out the size; this is way too small for my needs. I was expecting the European style smoker box that is large enough to put a large fish or salon steaks on a grill inside the box along with the chips on the bottom, place the lid on and put on top of the BBQ or on top of stove [be sure to have a strong smoke extractor]. The heat from the BBQ sets the chips smoldering and smokes the fish/meat/fowl/fruit/etc.Should have guessed it was not what I was looking for by the price. I did not see a discription or size listed on the product listing."
2,Rusted through,"I got it a couple of years ago, and now have to replace - it rusted through.Well made and easy to use - until its stainless steel qualities are gone."
1,Too tall for the grill,"Smoke box was too tall for the Weber Genesis grill, it would not fit between the flavor bars and the grilling rack. I had to return it. Got one from Home Depot, a bit larger but works great."
3,Good writing tips but not applicable to dynamic workplace,"Some of the basic writing tips regarding word choice, sentence length, reading level, and formatting are great. The rest might apply if your company has never documented its policies and procedures before or if you work in a static workplace (government office?) where policies or procedures are added or changed only a couple of times a year (do people really still print these on paper?) However, if you work at a dynamic, constantly changing company that must respond to thousands of different customer queries a day, much of the advice is not applicable."
4,Excellent. Easy to read or use as a reference.,No dry reading about theory here. Ms. Campbell has created a very useful tool.
1,Not a Good Steam Cleaner,"I bought this as a replacement for the Shark hand steamer which gave out after about 4 years. The second time I used the McCulloch MC1235 Handheld Steam Cleaner the trigger stuck and I could only get the steam spray to stop by unplugging the unit. Not good! It mostly spurts hot water, not steam; making messy, watery mop-up. Does not loosen greasy residue. If looking for a hand held steamer, look at a different one."
4,Love this product,"I have used both the damage therapy treatment and shampoo, and they are fantastic on hair that is often times colored and /or styled. I have very fine hair, but after a couple months I have noticed a lot less breakage and much more body. I admit, the product is expensive, but truly worth the price!"
1,Buy direct for less,AVEDA retails this product for $26. The AVEDA products for sell here are either old product or illegally diverted product. Most of the time you will pay more for old product. You can order new product directly from AVEDA or buy at a local AVEDA salon. Save money and make sure you are using product that works.
4,You Must Have This Book,"Not only does this book have some excellent Seafood recipes, there is more, It is printed on really thick Butchers paper making it completly durable, which is a must with how often it gets used at my house."
4,Hoffritz 6-Piece Steak Knife Set,"really nice value. had maybe 2 or 3 tiny ""stains"" on 1 or 2 knives even though they're supposed to be stainless. but they in no way detract from appearance or performance. all one piece means no broken handles. nice weight, perform wonderfully. good value for price."
4,Nice gift at a nice price,"I gave this as a gift and it was a big hit. I thought the case was a very nice bonus and gave them a place to store the knives without taking up counter space. There was a red powder on them that I had to clean off-not sure what that was, but it came off easily. I did not use the knives but thought they were well made for a very good price."
3,steak set,"This set was OK. The knives are sharp and cut well. They are heavy and feel secure in the hand. However the handles, which are the same material as the blades, make the knives appear less than astethicly pleasing.Box was cheap looking but ok for a sale item."
1,Ouch,This is amazingly expensive for a work that is not even new. I will shop elswhere to find a better deal. 40 dollars for an old CD....come on!!
4,Sturdy and handy,"I have been using this small light everyday since I got it. It's powerful enough and the laser pointer is really helpful for me being a teacher. The only problem is that the rubber button that covers the on/off switch wears off quite fast, leaving the inside of the flashlight open to the elements making it no longer water sealed. The hand strap also broke off but that is easily replaceable with cord or an unexpensive keychain."
1,1 star is generous,"This book is the worst programming book I have ever read. I get much more out of the O'Reilly books, SAM's ""teach yourself"" series, Peachpit Press, etc... There are so many other options than this. Still, professors have a tendency to recommend books that make good ""textbooks"" not necessarily good learning devices. That's the only reason my professor selected this... that and he knew the authors. I encourage you to look elsewhere unless it is required."
4,A very dark horror drama that's worth watching.,"I saw this film at the 2010 Terror Film Festival. I watched this not really knowing what to expect and I was pleasantly surprised. This isn't really a slasher film at all. This film is a dark, gritty psychological horror drama. The film focuses more on how and why the serial killer is made than on the aftermath of his creation. Some may think the film moves slowly for this reason, but I think this was really intended by the director. The audience is taken on a young mans dark twisted mental journey that eventually leads him to the inevitable. The film also touches on a very dark concept involving the balance of the universe, but leaves the viewer to draw his or her own conclusions about it. This gets 4 solid stars from me. It's always great to watch a different type of horror film after seeing so many that follow such a routine structure."
1,"Predictable, overdrawn, & self indulgent",In short this film takes a simple concept of making a coming out movie into a blood soaked self indulgent boring story. It has an ending you can see from a mile away and in the end left me angry because I expected more.
3,Nothing New (But Not Totally Without Merit),"""What's the point of having/building a network if you're not nurturing and leveraging it? This book is lighter on practical 'to-do's' than I would like, and it skews heavily towards off-line methods in its approach. Not a must-have but a good addition to a personal success library if you are not expecting a one-stop solution."
2,"Semi-useful, but nothing new","If you've read at least one networking book, you most likely will find little, if anything, useful from this one. I must admit there are some helpful hints such as: 1) Avoid the Lone Ranger mentality, 2) Give without expecting anything in return, 3) Gain value from every contact, 4) Become an active and perceptive listener, & 5) The 3 Foot Rule.These(like most of the 59 ""secrets"") present a somewhat hackneyed approach to networking. Although worth a look-see, I would recommend a check out from the library for this title, rather than wasting your mula."
1,What the are those reviews talking abt? ( bk for simpletons),"This book is the most useless , non substantive peace of literature on social networking I've ever read. First of all it reads like a children's book with bold large fonts, and only gives a paragraph full of advice each chapter. The advice wouldn't be different from what your mother would say. The authors clearly extended this to make it seem longer, and more substantive. Truly a super disappointment. The reviews on top make me question who really wrote those."
5,bridgeman's drawing for life from Amazon,I find that this book is too advanced for me at this time so I will keep it until such time I am ready to work at the level this book covers. The book is nicely done and I feel a good value for the price.
2,drawing from life review,I think this book is not very clear when trying to explain how to draw the body. The drawings are dark and it is hard to see the drawings clearly. I probably not buy this book if you are looking for something very detailed.
2,Bridgman's Complete Guide to Drawing From Life,"I read one other review that was critical of this book. I think most opinions are swayed by Bridgman's reputation. It is hard to agrue with his credentials. But for me this book lacks the clarity to help my students learn to draw the human form. The sketches are interesting to look at in their own right, but the text is confusing and isn't tied to the visuals.I feel there are other more helpful reference books such as ""Drawing the Human Anatomy"", by Civardi. I still prefer my original anatomy book by Peck.At best this could be a good companion, but shouldn't be someone's first or only anatomy book."
5,Wonderful!,I bought this book for my little sister and she loves it! The book came on time and it was in wonderful condition! Thanks again! :)
4,Perfect!,"I am glad I chose this Study Bible. Wish it came in giant print. However, the content makes the print size able to overlook!!!!!!"
5,"Daily Study Bible for Women: A Hit with Inmates, Too!","I bought this Bible from Jill Briscoe when she came to speak at our church. I like it, because one can study themes throughout the Bible with devotionals and page numbers to follow throughout. I bought one for a Christian inmate at a local prison. She had no Bible study helps and loves this Bible. Now, several others in that dorm want one."
2,Missing Page Numbers,"I'm so dissappointed. I purchase 2 of these. I kept one and gave the other to my sister-in-law. My book does not have numbered pages! Throughout the book it references page numbers so that if you are interested in reading something you should go to that page. If you are not an experienced Bible reader, it would take you FOREVER to figure out where that particular book was in the Bible. I do know my way around the Bible so I can figure it out, but my sister-in-law who is ""new"" to reading it will be completely lost. This is definitely NOT the right one for her. Has anyone else experienced this?"
5,A Wonderment Study Bible For All Women,This was a gift for one of my god-daughters. She is just high in spirits after receiving it. This was needed in doing unto others as you would have them do for you. She has been by my side during my husband's long illness and his passing. I am so blessed to have someone who sacrificed so much of her time with me.
1,Wrong Title,No matter what the title says this is not a study Bible. I can not recommend to any one looking for a good study Bible.
1,Way too many errors,Most people believe the Bible to be accurate... if you are one of these people then this Bible is not for you.It has a lot of typos and I even noticed a verse missing! Whoops!
4,Helpful to parents,"I bought this because discussion was moving toward ADD regarding my child. The anecdotal family stories match my experience but it also offers valuable aid to parents of non-ADD teens. The problem with the book (maybe it's just the Kindle version) is in it's editing. For example, it took me until I was a third of the way thru the book to discover that ""offer"" was substituted for ""over"" constantly - a find/checkspell mistake. That is just one example. However, the messages and tips come thru and are very valuable to all parents."
2,Modern dance workout,"I agree with the prevoius reviewers for the most part.It's just her alone in a leotard with a hipscarf & barefoot on a stage with hardwood floors with a sweet voice. The music is great, different styles such as eastern, western, Celtic, etc. all with strong beats & some lyrics.The workout themselves are not complicated, they are very watered down, very basic version of popular dances, etc., that I barely recognized them. Some of the dances seemed a little silly like just doing an airplane like a little kid does, but she encourages you to dance how you want to, just feel the beat & go free.I didn't get much of a workout at all, even at the 3rd style workout (I didn't do all 3 at once.) The third one was only a little different from the first one so I was disapointed by that, but not really suprised. I like the idea of combining dances & more of a freedom, but I, unfortunately, really didn't get into it."
3,plastic,"what can i say its a tolet its a good unit for the price,,they should have a seat warmer for the winter!!!"
3,"Excellent album, but poor copy","This (along with Volume I) is one of my favorite albums, and I have listened to it many times before. I would give this 5 stars hands down if it weren't for the poor quality of this particular recording. I don't know if I received a bad CD or what, but multiple tracks skip. The disc is not scratched, and I have tried listening to the CD directly and digitally (ripped to FLAC) on my computer, but it always skips in the same spots. This is definitely an album that you want to listen to straight through uninterrupted, and these skips completely break the immersion."
3,Yankee Logo Canvas Chair,This chair is really cute to take around to the fields the only thing I didnt like was the white part on the back is all paint over the canvas which is cracking....
4,A great gift,"This was a gift so I haven't used it but my nephew loved it. It arrived early, was well packaged and it is the same quality as one might expect from camping or beach chairs!"
4,Pretty good...,"These sheets are pretty good. After reading some horror stories I was really worried about buying these, but for $50 how can you really go wrong. Well they arrived and right out of the bag they looked/smelled fine. I washed them right away and when they came out of the drier I felt them for softness. They aren't the softest sheets in the world but they aren't rough by any means. These sheet are pretty thick. When I dropped them on the floor to change my bed it was a noticeable sound. When I got them on my bed it was very nice. The sheets were nice and crisp, although they like to be wrinkled. I've really enjoyed sleeping on these sheets, and so has my wife. So with all that said I would recommend these to anyone that likes crisp good looking sheets."
3,NOT PIMA COTTON as stated in the product description,"Pima Cotton is second to Egyptian cotton in durability and softness. Thus last month I was willing to pay $109.99 for each 1000tc set. I received the items and found that they were labeled simply ""100% combed cotton sateen"".... nowhere does it say Pima Cotton. PROs: The fabric surface is smooth, and sheets' thickness make them durable enough to stand up to a lot of washings. CON: They are too thick and stiff to sleep on comfortably, esp in tropical climates. I am returning these in favor of a couple of Egyptian cotton sheet sets I bought in the same order."
1,Not a luxury sheet.,"These appeared to be priced too well to be true. They are.Not a luxury sheet, way too heavy and not soft.You get what you pay for in sheets and these are not good.Luxury sheeting of 500-600 single-ply threads will be a hundred times better.The best value sheets are the wamsutta single ply in 400, 500 and 600 thread count.Don't buy these."
1,Disappointing luxury,"These sheets were super stiff and not what I expected from such a high thread count. They also stay permanently wrinkled, that even ironing does not correct. My guests said they were comfortable. I just don't like the way they look."
1,Disappointing item,This item is not what has been advertised.It is not pima cotton and the overall texture of the sheets is very coarse.These sheets are not as soft as a 400 thread count sheet set i already had.They are stiff and always look wrinkled.For only 40 dollars you could not buy much more but these sheets are no deal.
2,Expected higher quaility for the price,Expected a higher quality sheet for the price.Thinner then expected and after two washing starting to ball.Deep pockets do not Hold securely
4,Good Overview of Actionscripting,"This book presents a comprehensive overview of Flash 5 actionscripting. The author uses language that is easy to follow (great for the non-developer types like me) and keeps each lesson interesting. I would recommend this book to anyone new to actionscripting, looking to sharpen their actionscripting skills, or making the transition from Flash 4 to Flash 5."
3,For people who like to read tech manuals only!,"I started reading this book and must say that it DOES state that it's for intermediate to expert users, but it reads like a dictionary. To be fair, I haven't got past page 27. Reading this book is TEDIOUS. I don't know hat I was expecting but I was expecting it to be more fun."
1,Utterly Lame,"Don't waste your money on this book. The author NEVER explains the programming logic behind the ActionScripts which are presented. Instead, he seems to think that by putting a bunch of clever ActionScript code onto the page which does something you'd never use when doing a ""real"" Flash project that he has somehow enlightened you into the mysteries of ActionScript programming. Save your money for other, more insighful books which actually present a foundation along with the code."
3,Not for beginners.,"It's about time a book was written to address the booming world of ActionScripting. Easy enough for most designers and powerful enough for programmers to enjoy, this is a great language that hasn't been given enough attention in the publishing world. Overall, the book was fairly good. Techniques were explored and the new Flash 5 language was explained. Although I feel this book was rushed out and not enough clear explaination was presented in the lessons, it's still the only book out there that deals exclusivly with ActionScript. For that reason alone this is a book worth buying."
3,Decent but somewhat disappointing,"The books tagline, ""Guide to Advanced Design Features"", really implies that the contents would include, well, advanced features. Unfortunately the XML object is completely glossed over, data transfer is all but ignored, and issues, such as physics, don't seem to exists. This is a beginner's book.I also really don't like the format of all examples, and virtually no reference. I'm guessing that most so-called ""advanced"" users are in the midst of their own projects, and don't want to wade through someone else's .fla file every time they need a question answered.In the end, this book is okay, but the author seemed to take the lazy route: he glosses over difficult topics, and simply provides an analysis of his own files. And, unfortunately, the files are not very useful, since much better .fla files are available online (flashkit.com, etc.).If you are just starting out with ActionScript, though, this isn't a bad choice."
1,"Confusing, NOT for experts, NOT for beginners....","I have carefully studied through the whole book...DON'T BUY THIS BOOKI am very disappointed about it.It is confusing, and doesnt follow any plot in teaching.Let's say... the chapter to explain arrays... arrays are fundamental part in programming. Ok... the example doesnt talk much about arrays, but it includes some code with commands that are explained 6 chapters further... and how about arrays??? really stupid...While teaching you ACTIONSCRIPTING it is supposed you know how to create a movieclip... in any example, 2 pages are wasted in telling you stuff like ""Now, make a square of purple colour (choose the picker and put FF00GG)...."" And that for every example... i mean... teaching me actionscript???? and all that pages I PAIED FOR??? guiding me in choosing colours??? and how about the ""now go to the menu SYMBOL and choose....""WASTED MONEY!!!"
3,In betweener,"This book definitely needs to go indepth or longer. It's not really a step by step. The samples already have the coding in it. If you are already familiar with some action script, this book doesn't teach you anything new, except OOP syntax."
3,Good for beginners.,"I arrived at Flash 5 and ActionScript from the Pascal -> C -> C++ -> Javascript route and so the syntax and operation is extremely natural to me.I found that after the first 10 pages or so I was flicking ever faster through the book until I collided with the index coming the other way!Purchase this book if you've never programmed before. If you have programmed before, highlight the function and press <F1>!(...)"
3,Hipeople !!!,"The First Unit, Justice, the Watcher and balance of the unit's strenght, her indentical twin brothers, Thomas, the magician, and Levi, the sufferer, and Dorian, the healer oppressive Dustland. Dustland is in the distant future. It wants to lead the thirsty Slackers from the desert. While doing that, they discover other life-forms that are gathered at the water hole and lead them all out of Dustland and into a high-tech city of domes. They have to battle an evil force known as Mal."
5,Definitely One of the Building Blocks of My Mispent Youth,"My parents were bibliophiles and the house was full of Reader's Digest books.I went through most of them by the time I was sixteen and has since had a hard time adjusting to boring reality.War is war but when you're 13 and reading it from this book it would seem like a wonderland of honor, bravery and behind-the-scenes stuff. I still wonder about Monty's double, Himmler's masseuse and the one that got away- Von Werrra.It is true that war is hell. But it didn't seem back then when I was reading this book."
5,Good Gluten Free Snack Bar,These are good gluten free snack bars that don't have any artificial ingredients. They have the consistency and taste of brownies with pieces of Cherries in them and maca too. They are a little pricier than power bars but well worth the price. They have 2 other varieties (one is not gluten free) but we like the cherry chunk the best.
5,"Excellent, VERY tasty.","Maca is a wonderous thing. I really can tell the difference since getting these. Wonderful flavor. This one is less sweet than the maple chunk version, but the little cherries are very tasty. Portable, easy to eat and great chocolate flavor. Notice I did not mention the maca flavor, I do not taste it! That is work the price alone. GREAT deal buying here versus other vendors. I have one everyday."
5,Best STUDENT GRADE paints around,"The price and quality you get in these student grade paints can't be beat.-They're okay when extended with medium. You have to use a lot of them in the medium to not lose the colour. I recommend using a professional medium with them if you can afford it. I definitely noticed a difference when I used Liquitex gel mediums vs Golden or Winsor & Newton.-The pigment load is okay, but will not look ""vibrant"". Some of the colours are noticeably brighter than others when mixed with medium (Pthalo blue looks great for example, whereas primary yellow tends to look flat)-They don't hold up to the test of time well, the lightfastness is not great but definitely better than other student grade paints.I recommend these for:-Art students/any school based painting project-Hobbyist or new painter-Experimentation with new techniquesI do not recommend these for:-Paintings you intend to give as a gift (or keep)-Paintings you intend to sell-Anyone past ""student"""
3,"Pretty good, very short..","I guess you can't be too critical of a little kid writing a book. I have to admit, this was quite insightful to see how this little boy handles the challenges of Asperger Syndrome. I was impressed that he's a member of Mensa, which illustrates how some people with AS can come blessed with some real gifts, although I don't think that's the norm. I thought the book was short, though, and I expected more for the price I paid. Again, you can't expect too much from a little kid.. but I thought it was overpriced, even through Amazon, which is saying something. It was a very quick read, and entertaining, even somewhat cute."
1,Terrible,This book was a tremendous disapointment. Ridiculous. A waste of the short time it takes to read - unless you are an ABA teacher and need to read something to build your ego. Other than that - save your money.
5,Inside View of Aspergers,"Awesome! Kenneth is a 10 year old boy with AS. This book helps AS parents, teachers, & others to understand the delicate and complicated perspectives of an AS child's brain. Kenneth describes how the world looks to him and how so many things are a challenge for him. I've read the book numerous times. I have also quoted it in meetings and appeal hearings to help others understand my AS son's strenths and weaknesses. It allows ""outsiders"" an inside look at the world of Aspergers. My son has read it and feels it is describing his life. He is amazed that there is someone in the world that feels the way he does and views things the same way. This is a definite read for all who interact with these special children."
4,NOT A STEAK LOVER and LOVED THIS COOKBOOK,"This cookbook took away my fear of cooking red-meat. I especially loved the accompaniments, mushroom strudel, cowboy beans, steakhouse spinach, and tomato corn salsa. I originally purchased this book for my husband, but I ended up loving it myself! This is the most informative book on buying, and cooking steak."
2,Not as great as expected,"I was excited when I first received the book. At first glance it looked compact enough, with large print that is easy to refer to. I was disappointed at the lack of real pictures (it's difficult to follow recipes without a color picture as a guide!). I wanted to learn methods to cook steak. This book basically gives you a bunch of different sauces and side dishes. If you are one of those steakhouse lovers that believe in nothing but salt, pepper, and a hot grill/pan to make the perfect steak, this book is not for you."
5,really good,this part of the series is really good any one who likes fighting and training should watch this and all the others too.
4,Tenjho Tenge rocks!!!!,"The second volume to the Tenjho Tenge series has just as much action as the previous installment. The Juken Club is attacked while they are taking a break at the bowling alley by Executive Council. The fight scenes are great, and I can't wait for Volume 3. The only reason why I am giving it four stars instead of five is because this volume only has three episodes as opposed to four in the first."
2,POINTLESS TO BUY,"As I said before I love this anime, it's amazing. I am not putting down this anime with my review, I am just saying skip over this volume to buy because all it contains is three eposides with the samething. This one big fight. Main thing, group goes to bowling alley to relax and oh no, the bad people come. Pink haired girl takes the hot big breasted chick while Aya is taken on by this creepy looking man. Boobies are shown, pink haired girl is actually fat, the other guy with brown short hair who is silenet but violent beats the crap out of all the goonies who are sent to destory them. So the president of the bad club comes, the other guy's bro and he's all hot looking but all you see is the other's reaction and end of volume! Okay so now you don't need to buy this volume, go buy volume three, TERRIFIC VOLUME! ^-^ I apologize for not knowing any of the names, I have a terrible memorey."
3,LIGHT,NOT VERY INTERESTING NOT ENOUGH OF DALTON SOME THING AM SURE HE JUST DID FOR MONEY SO HE COULD GO ON DOING WHAT HE REALLY LIKED
2,Mildly funny. Majorly confusing.,"More than halfway through this movie I was still trying to figure out what the director was trying to say through his confused and strangely motivated characters. There are some funny moments, but these are buried among too many scenes that don't quite fit and odd exchanges between characters I couldn't bring myself to care about."
1,Naked in New York,"Oh dear, it's one of those films where the stars wish they hadn't made! Eric Stoltz does give an excellent performance and the plot i suppose is pretty good, but it's one of those classic 'it never gets started films' and when it tries to it falls into all your typical cliches!Tim Dalton...why? I mean I think the guy is a superb actor but, what are you doing man? What was the point in his role? Why did he decide to do it and...Oh I think I have given up asking this now!! Come Back James Bond all is forgiven!"
4,nail file review,"I really like my new nail file. It is very rough, but the one it is replacing was 45 years old, so I'm in the adjusting to ""new"" phase. The customer service is beyond excellent, I didn't receive the first one I ordered & they sent me another one w/o question or making any fuss. They are very fantastic to work with. The file is what you pay for."
2,"Quality has gone down, alas","Diamon Deb nail files were just about as close as you could get to a perfect product: well designed, a great price, easy to find, and a pleasure to use.I didn't know why the new one I bought had a broken tip, a bad sanding surface, and didn't really file well. I thought it was a fluke, and bought another, even worse. Then I saw it was now made in China. Quality has gone down, noticeably.Definitely not the same product as the made-in-USA file. I wish I could find an old one on sale. I'd keep it forever. The new one, and the one I bought after that, just don't make the cut."
2,Not the same file I'm familiar with!,I've been using the Diamon Deb nail files for years when I could find them and I loved them. The quality now is not near what it used to be when they were made in the USA. :(
1,Don't make 'em like they used to...,"I lost my 1970's vintage Diamond Deb nail file in the mid 90's (at least I thought I had) and found a new Diamond Deb file at a discount hair care chain store. The first time I used it, my thumb nail took the abrasive off the file...that's just wrong! I took the file back to the store and struggled for a couple of years with emory boards, other brands of files, etc when I unexpectedly found my trusty old Diamond Deb. Here it is 2010 and it's still going strong - I nearly keep it under lock and key! In short, don't buy one of the new ones, because it's too late."
3,Definitely not like the originals!!!,"I was thrilled to find a source for these too, but when I received them, they were stamped ""China"". The old ones are stamped ""USA"" The originals have a sharper point, a feature which I personally make great use of. The Chinese version has a rounded point which is far less effective for cleaning under the nails. I still have two of the old ones, but they have lost some of their filing strength. I use the newer ones, but am disappointed in the lack of quality. They are still superior to anything else on the market that I have been able to find. Much better than the glass ones and the new emery ones mounted on foam board, both types of which are too thick to even use well in the space between the nail and the finger. It seems to be impossible to avoid the changes which are repeatedly made to products which have already been perfected."
5,Great Family Study,I studied this book in a class I took for college. It is so amazing and a great resource guide in studying the proclamation. Surprising new outlooks that will make you stop and ponder. I recommend it to anyone.
5,We all need strength,The Proclamation comes in time for all of us to feel the support of leaders who love us and are willing to provide direction and counsel on how to manage our lives during such stress and world discord. It has made a statement for me that I can hold to in all times.
1,returned three so far,"Got two the pads for Christmas gifts for my kids.Pad number 1 was DOA.Pad number 2 lasted 35 minutes before it started registering multiple hits and kept displaying the xbox console anytime you touched the top part of the pad, as if I were pressing the sync button.Pad number 3 (replacement pad for pad number 1) was also DOA.Gave up and shipped them all back. Bought DDR2 and the Konami pad. Not as nice from a padding standpoint, but it seems to actually work."
1,"great idea, bad product","This is a great idea to add to your XBox 360 Dance Revolution game; it is padded and much easier on the feet. The product is bad, however, in that we have purchased two, and both were defective. The first pad lasted one week before it started acting up. It didn't always respond to the commands. The second pad was bad from the get-go. It either didn't respond or responded with the wrong commands. We will wait for another version to come out before we try this product again. Too bad, because when it works, it is great."
4,"Comfort, Quality and Playability. For a Limited Time Only.....","This is a good product overall. It is comfortable to use, dead-on accurate, stylish, and is the only real option for a soft padded dance mat for xbox 360. I love this product. The only reason I can't give it 5 stars, is because of two things. Price, and durability. The price is above a RedOctane Ignition pad and is of a slightly sub par build quality. This pad uses a much thiner foam for its inner core yet costs more?The durability is a concern as well but not huge. Anyone who has even a part time job should be able to buy one of these every 6 months easily as I have.Other than that I love this unit. I gladly pay over 100 bucks every six months so I can play comfortably, no problem."
1,arrows stopped working,"our family loved the thickness of this pad. But after 6 weeks of heavy use, some of the arrows stopped working. If you hit them in a specific place they work, somewhere close by, no go. Amazon is taking the mat back as a ""one time exception."""
2,"Bad, ineffective product",Very bad peripheral. Does not register hits accurately. Pad slides around alot during play. Internal pad does more harm than good as the pieces do not interlock tightly.
4,Much better game play,"I got DDR Universe for my wife as a gift and have become quite a fan of the game myself. The Beat Pad Pro is definitely much easier to play on than the Konami mat that came bundeled with the game. As long as you aren't wearing shoes, you can feel where the arrows are with your feet, so you don't have to take your eyes off the screen to get yourself realigned with the mat. The foam insert makes jumping much easier on the ankels and knees. The mat does tend to move around during play, but I don't think it's any worse than the bundeled mat. I woudn't know whether the game play more closely resembles that of the arcade game, since I never really seriously played the arcade. However, I do know that I tend to get higher scores on the Beat pad Pro versus the bundeled Konami mat...I can even beat my wife sometimes!"
4,Dance Dance Revolution Universe,"I'm 45 years old and it seems a bit silly for me to be doing something like this, but I like to dance (not that this is really dancing) and this is a good workout.Since I have a wife and 2 children I bought one to try it and then 3 more when I decided it was worth it. I'd like to have a metal one, but these are so much better than the one that came with DDRU they'll do fine until the aftermarket can generate a few choices for more high end products.These certainly are better and more comfortable than stock. It's easier to keep your feet centered without looking."
2,"Nice Idea, Bad Product","I ordered the Madcatz Beat Pad Pro from Circuit City once and found out that the pad is pretty tough to insert into the slot. Once I finally got it in, one of the zippers didn't even zip up properly. Good thing they supplied two of them. Finally, when I was almost done playing, the zippers came apart and left the foam mat open. It was pretty dissapointing, but playing the game on it was better than the Konami pads. I ended up returning this item for a full refund and just paid around $40 (foam from JoAnn fabrics, super glue, and a yoga mat) to mod two konami pads that I bought in a DDR1 bundle and DDR2 bundle. Hope that helps. And now I play and I don't disturb my downstairs neighbors. Awesome! Love the DDR series for Xbox 360!"
3,Ok for the low price,Not much to be said other than is is OK for the low price. I much prefer the aluminum type clamp over the plastic but it did the trick for me to repair a half dozen pool cues lying around with broken tips after taking them out of storage and getting my pool table operational again.
4,Ops Mgr,"Very functional & works great we really like it over other products, easy to purchase, delivery was quick, installed in a breeze."
3,Eh ..,It was okay for the price I guess. It looked kinda cheap but it did the job somewhat. Great price for a set like this though.
5,"Fast Action, Slick Fun, and Witty-ness up the Wazoo","Okay.. so my title description says it all. The Gunsmith Cats series is pretty seriously gripping unlike almost ALL the other comics I've ever read. It has irony (which I like), some very cool plots with indescribable artistry that redefines two dimensional action in a comic. You'll be hooked."
1,should have shopped at the GoodWill,"Product quality very poor, even taking into consideration the Chinese origin. Hat size was tiny --same as shown on the little pug, though I ordered a size XL for my smallish Golden Retreiver mix (50 lbs). The suit barely fit him, i.e it was overall too small. The feather didn't stand up. Good thing my dog is so cute that he looked great despite this costume!"
2,"""Cheesy"" quality material",I received the product in a timely manner. The costume is a very poor quality and I don't know if I will use it or not. Not worth the $$ to return it. The hat is cute!
2,Useful but TMI,Wiley books are good if you have a lot of time to study.. I means hours a day. There is so much info in them and they don't do a good job of keeping things concise. Switched to another program and passed 3 parts of CPA exam so far.
1,Don't buy this for your TIVO,"Only the B2 version of this product is compatible with TIVO. There is no way to guarantee that Amazon will ship you the correct version of this product. I ordered it and the B1 version arrived at my doorstep. So I returned it and indicated that I specifically needed version B2. I got an email back that seemed to indicate that it wouldn't be a problem to send the correct version. My replacement just arrived and it's still B1. After speaking to a customer service rep on the phone it seems that there is no way for Amazon to guarantee that they can send me the correct product because their orders are processed by machines and not human beings. Do yourself a favor and don't bother ordering this product for your TIVO. Since I was unable to actually use adapter I can't say anything about how it works, it may work wonderfully with your home computer."
1,Problems with TiVo,"I have an older series 2 TiVo that has been working great with a Linksys WUSB12 for a couple years. I just installed the D-Link DWL-G120 adapter and it installed just fine. There were no problems. It connects to the TiVo service with no errors. Then I tried to transfer a recorded program to my PC. The transfer rate is a slow 2 Mbps. The signal quality is excellent. (It's only 15 ft distance) This is half the speed of the WUSB12 B adapter. I was hoping for greater speed using the D-link G adapter. However, the real problem is disturbing. When I start the transfer it causes the TiVo to restart. That's right. The TiVo restarts over and over. It begins to slowly transfer the file and restarts the TiVo within a few minutes. After many tries, I put the Linksys WUSB12 back in and all is normal."
3,it works; limited range,"Friday, January 19, 2007 2:48 pm. I got two of these. They are *definitely* less sensitive than two DWL-122s I had already. The g120s were basically unusable in the ""front"" room here in my computer attic, where the 122s worked fine. The g120s worked OK in the ""back"" room, so naturally I switched them around and all is well. The wireless access point is downstairs near the ceiling in the center of the house. The ""bad"" distance to it is about 26'; the good, 13'."
1,Bad Bad products,"It suddenly stoped working after two months. The tech support is even worse, alway tried to let me believe the problem is from router. Don't trust D-link!"
2,Choose a different adapter,"This hardware does not live up to its promise. It cannot maintain a stable connection, and high connection speed in a ""real life"" environment. I am using it to connect my desk top to my wireless home network. My router (a 802.11g D-Link) is 25-30 feet away obstructed by only a wall (you know couple of drywall sheets and some 2x4s) and the signal strength is always below 20% with speeds only up to 2.0 Mbps. All my other wireless devices have full speeds and strengths at the same spot (where i have the D-link adapter)."
2,Don't advise trying this for Tivo,"The product itself is probably fine. However, there is no way (as of this writing) for Amazon to guarantee that you get the correct revision--they can't check stock at that level. I got the wrong revision and had to return. If you are getting through Amazon from a 3rd party reseller, you might have more sucess--but somebody should be able to visibly check the box label before you order..."
1,Not a good product,This wireless adapter didn't have good signal strength at 25' though I have a new router. Replaced this adapter with a TrendNet adapter (TEW424UB) and getting full strength all the time.
2,I expected better connectivity,"This offers poor connectivity considering the bulkiness of the install (separate cable to connect and flip up design). I expected an improvement in signal strength from my tiny USB direct plugin type. I was wrong. I am typically happy with other D-link offerings but this one's a dude.Plus, I have more advanced encryption on my cheapo USB adapter. This is limited to WEP."
5,works great with TIVO,I bought this to a provide a wireless connection for our TIVO. It works well and the set up was easy. We plugged it into tivo and it found our home network without a problem.
1,wi-fi,"My hp notebook has built in wi-fi, which works good, however I wanted a wi-fi device that could obtain a stronger signal and have greater range, the DWL-G120 is weaker than my built in wi-fi in my notebook pc."
1,Don't waste your money.,"Wow ,this is bad ,very bad product ,it sounds just with almost any device like a cell phone .but at the end you get what are you paying for,my advice:Don't waste your money.Update: i requested a refund and i never got it."
4,Works as advertised. Do not buy the overpriced competition,"The signal on this thing is WEAK. You have to be right up on a bug in order to detect it. But that's how I always saw them using those things on the Soprano's and similar shows. That's how I think it should be done anyway, so you can figure out the location of what exactly is setting off your surveillance detector."
2,Professional Wireless RF Signa Bug Detector,Save your money. This unit will buzz near most any electrical outlet. It never picked up recorders that we placed around to find.
3,Not Sure!,"Not sure if this item works or not. I really could not detect any ""yes"" or ""no"" signal changes during use. I might be using it incorrectly but..... oh well, not much to say on the subject. Would recommend for those who may understand better how these devices work."
3,Basically works,"It detects the presence of a continuous rf signal.I was hoping to detect a acknowledge pulse from a called cell phone with ts ringer off. It is not that sensitive, and does not appear to be able to detect a short RF pulse.It does detect continuous RF from a cell phone, or a Cordless phone or FRS radio at least. It also has a sensitivity control and it is possible to make qualitative evaluations of signal strengths, and antennas.The Chinese specifications, and instructions however couldn't be worse."
1,Piece of junk,"Bought this to check around the house for radiation.I guess you get what you pay for. It buzzes ALL the time. With the sensitivity down, nothing, with it up, all the time...even 500 feet from the house out in the country in the middle of 20 acres in a 'dead' cellphone zone.I'd send it back but it's not even worth the postage. And the instructions, you would think Chinese manufacturers would keep at least one person on retainer to translate the instructions to something at least resembling English....no, not even that...."
1,Was Broken When It Arrived. Worthless plastic. Ended up in the trash can,This product arrived in a beautiful box. The detector was made a child like plastic and did not work at all. It ended up in the trash. Worthless.
5,"BUY this! READ this, now!","How to Get Into Law School, by Prof. Estrich, has been abundantly helpful to me as I make my way through the admissions process. Her advice is frankly honest and substantially more insightful than the resources I have come across to date. It cannot do anything but help any law school applicant in their odyessy through admissions. Check out her specific advice on getting the right recommendations letters, how to write your personal statment and how to choose the right school for you. Reading this gift of insider info, left me feeling like I had just been let in on the biggest secrets of how to gain admission. Prof. Susan Estrich KNOWS and delivers more pertinent info than a multitude of the commerical LSAT and Law Admissions volumes put together. Best of luck to you on your journey! Send your prayers above for mine, I. Tanvishut, New Orleans, LA."
3,Valuable advice seasoned with snob.,"Overall, its pretty good compared to several I've read. Estrich has some downsides...she assumes you are applying to a ""top"" law school. For the thousands of us each year desiring to attend law school who aren't in the elite in terms of LSAT, gpa, etc., or perhaps just dont want to attend Yale, Harvard, Berkeley, etc., this may not be the best choice of book to fit your needs. The advice is really universal, just slanted toward the ivy league as if its the only way to go.Also, paralegals beware: Estrich will offend you. I believe she writes ""why be a lesser version of what you really want to be."" Did she say ""lesser""? Yes, she did. Ouch. As a paralegal of 10 years, I didn't at all care for her biased attitude. She basically portrays paralegals as people who run a xerox all day and have no place in law school."
1,So-so,"The book is useful but to be compared to other authors: this one is too snobbish for me...I got tired of numbers and constant preaching. After finishing it I felt a relief and almost fear instead of motivation and had a feeling like my mom just scolded me. I'm almost 30, American- European, with 2 educations and not easily impressed. What works for me-it's motivation and not put-downs. If you are that person- go for Robert Miller- and you'll derive pleasure, motivation and large knowledge about ""how to""."
1,"i RECIEVED A BOOK I DID NOT ORDER...I ORDERED ""WHY DO NUMBERS COUNT"" AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY I GOT HOW TO GET INTO LAW SCHOOL","I ordered ""Why Do Numbers Count"" by Lance Shaler. It is still in the brown wrapper...I have been traveling...I've already spent for a book that I didn't ever order...what do I do?????I recieved HOW TO GET INTO LAW SCHOOL ????MAKES ME SKEPTICAL ABOUT ORDERING FROM AMAZON . i RATED THIS TRANSACTION WITH ONE STAR BECAUSE THE SYSTEM WOULDN'T LET ME NOT RATE ..?"
3,Older book in the series,I found this book well written & very interesting. It's a futuristic series book with your good guys against the evil ones.
3,"Some things are good, some things AREN'T","I read the book and tried the concept, lost weight, felt better for awhile (in joint pain especially) and then developed continuous painful heartburn after eating fruit if I did not have regular food at least half an hour later. If I ate nothing until noon (as the book says to do) I found the fruit DID NOT digest within half an hour (as the book says it will). I would be burping it the entire morning. The fruit sure felt acidic, even though the Diamonds state fruit is alkaline. How can fruit be alkaline when it's used in alpha-hydroxy potions to burn dead skin off your face? Any explanations or similar problems?"
3,In The Middle,"I really appreciate the ""natural hygiene"" half of this book. Trying it even briefly demonstrates that it's pretty much on the mark.The food-combining half, though, was another issue for me. I will not knock that many people have benefited from this. However, I think that everyone has different food requirements, stemming from, among other things, body type.I find from personal experience that a ""Zone"" (a la Barry Sears) approach leads to better health. The Zone approach is the opposite of the food combining approach. I heard Sears on the radio, and he said that the stomach is essentially a huge acid pit that dissolves everything, and that the acid or base quality of food really doesn't register.I say to try this book out and see if it works for you, but don't be surprised if you don't have the same results that others have."
5,Fit For Life,Makes so much sense. My blood work is the best it's ever been after 4 months of following the eating principles in this life-saving book!!!
5,The best health book out there,"It's a bit old... and sometimes it comes across very 70's-ish...But there is NO other book out there as good as this one.Start with the premise that your current, modern eating habits are the primary problem with your weight.Therefore, living a healthier lifestyle will let you lead a better, healthier life AND you'll loose weight at the same time.All this written in an easy to read format.Okay, let's cut through all the BS here! If you're like most, you've read several other weight loss books. And you've probably gotten mixed information! Aktins says to eliminate carbs and eat meat. The next says it's okay to mix, so long as you do so proportionally to the energy value calculated per gram of blahblahblah.THIS book does the ONE thing you want a health and nutrition book to do: MAKE COMMON SENSE! There's no higher recommendation I can give it beyond the fact that, when you read it, you nod your head and think ""yeah. That makes sense!""A MuSt ReAd for anyone. Period!"
4,fir for life,"this is a new idea in eating plans (new to me). plan requires a change of eating habits, but is very effective. don't have emergency hunger pangs, and have lost 13+ pounds in a few months. would recommend to anyone. love having nothing but fruit until noon.i don't have to rush around to fix breakfast. i can get on with my day and eat breakfast around noon, then lunch around 2 or 3 when i used to get very hungry. then i eat a well-rounded meal instead of snacking desperately.there is also a very good cookbook by one of the authors, harvey's wife, marilyn, (although they are not married any more, they are still friends), that includes some of the recipes in the original book, and many, many more. (""the american vegitarian cookbook from the fit for life kitchen"" by marilyn diamond) published more recently.i recommend both books heartily as they have made a vast difference in the way i eat and the way i feel.joan craig"
3,Hard to take seriously,"The lifestyle plan is worth trying, but I'm terribly skeptical of the book. There is a list of things that he says are good for you. As he talks about each one, he claims that particular thing is THE MOST IMPORTANT THING YOU COULD POSSIBLY DO FOR YOUR BODY AND HEALTH. Then there is a list of things that he says are bad for you (like meat, dairy, etc.). And each one, he says, is TOXIC POISON THAT PUTS YOUR BODY INTO TURMOIL AND EVEN DANGER. Of course, he later says that if you just can't give up meat, go ahead and eat it. Hmmmm."
3,This book is a very sensible approach to weight loss.,"I have read this amazing book, but as usual I deviate from its teachings. I believe the book is a reference book for health and weight loss everyone should have in their library. However, I have a problem. After eating the fruits I tend to get very hungry. I have read a book called ""The Carbohydrates Addict Diet"", which indicates that a large consumption of fruit which is a carbohydrate, causes you to crave sweets and other carbohydrate filled foods or leaves you hungrier. Has anyone else experienced this problem??"
4,comment on Fit for Life (book),Usefull book if you want to change your eating habits and perhaps loose a few kilos !
2,Eat Fruits,"It is a great idea to have only fruit for breakfast, I did it for a week and lost one Kilo, you feel better after a while. I like the way the author explains every suggestions though I do not follow them entirely because I love meat."
1,Complete quackery,"I read through about 1/3 of this book several years ago when I finally decided that it was complete quackery. For example, the main theme of the book is that different foods will produce either ""acidic"" or ""alkaline"" digestive juices. Where are they getting this from? Enzymes digest food, aided somewhat by an HCl solution in the stomach. I don't know where they came up with the ""alkaline digestive juices"" idea--presumably they just made it up. Further nonsense about ""live atoms"" vs. ""dead atoms"" convinced me that the authors have absolutely no idea what they're talking about. Just Say No."
3,Disapointed : (,Maybe because I am fairly new to ordering from Amazon I was under the impression that I was ordering a hard copy but recieved a paperback. So for all you newbies make certain you are ordering what you want. It also took over one month to get to me! My local bookstore was going to be able to order it and get it to me within a week but I thought well let me order it and have it delivered right to my home in the same time. Not so... I had placed another order just 2 days later for another book and recieved it in 3 days! So overall I was not thrilled with my ordering off of Amazon.
3,Didn't work for me,"I was hoping that this book would work for me but it didn't. The number one bit of advice here is to eat only fruit before noon, and I did that for a week or two and there was absolutely no difference in my weight. I also stuck to their food combining rules the rest of the day. It made no difference at all. I realized that the author's claim, that you don't need to diet, you just need to watch your food combining, is untrue. The whole premise of the book is baloney. But there are still some good things in here. He's on the right side of the healthy food debate. He just oversteps himself. We shouldn't be interested in his claims that this or that is simple common sense. You can put a lot of things under the umbrella of what seems to be common sense to you, but that doesn't mean it is right."
1,Book? more like a research paper,"I threw the books away after a few pages of nothing but rantings of ""how great I am"" by the author. They may have gotten me to buy some books but I will not read them or pass them on,... they are only fit for the burn barrel.At least they can produce some heat to cook my steak."
1,Not fit for writing a health book.,"I read this book a few years ago and noticed right away the vegetarian message. Vegetarians, unfortunately, are very unhealthy based on the high amounts of carbs and lack of protein and fat. Also what are the credentials of the writers? This book just pushes the low fat dogma from the 80's but hopefully people today are more aware that fat is not the problem. Save yourself the time by not reading this book and focus on reading material written by highly credentialed people or physicians who explain the real nutritional truth of the importance of fat, protein and selected amounts of carbohydrates to fit your metabolism. Example would be the Metabolic diet written by Dr. Mauro DiPasquale."
1,Simply Bad,"This book is one of the worst books that i have ever bought . The writers are just based on emotion and not to scientific facts . They hate any food that is not green .They use some psuedoscientific facts though for example , If u put a child in a cage whith a rabit and an apple the child will eat the apple and play whith the rabit thats why we must not eat meal !!! there is an abundance of such '' scientific facts''.Stay away from this book , it can only make your health worst ."
4,Great recipes for healthy eating.,"I really agree with a lot of what this book teaches, it just makes sense. I love the recipe section too. It definitely makes it easier to follow the program."
5,its not a diet its a way of life;the healthy way!!!!,its hard to call this book a diet book because its not like you are starving yourself you are changing what you eat and changing with what and when. i use to tip the scales a 240 lbs. and found no time to exercise and just by reading and putting to use what ileaned about how my body works i lost 65 lbs in about a years time slowly but surely. i highly reccommend this book it will change the way you eat and what you eat for the best.
5,This book has considerably changed my way of eating.,"""Fit for Life"", an incredible source in which I have found answers for many questions regarding foods, food combinations and order of eating. This book, which I have read with great enthusiasm, has considerably changed my way of eating and increased my physical performance significantly. I am trying to apply the principles stated in the book and recommending them to all my acquaintances. Dr. Ali Balamir"
4,Fine,The product came in a timely fashion and I had no problems. The only thing that wasn't as expected was that the book I got was not the one in the picture. The one I received was an older version and had a different cover.
3,Very pro-vegan,"Fit for Life was all the rage in the late 80's. I admit that much of the advice works for the short term. While I cannot support the anti-meat campaign that it endorses, I found that most of the advice works. I have tried the food combining and it does keep one more mentally alert. I admire that Harvey and Marilyn Diamond were not afraid about criticizing current eating habits, such eating dairy and raw fish (sushi). This book might not be for the serious athlete, but it has some good information. Good food for thought if you want to feel better.Doug Setter, Bsc.Author ofStomach FlatteningandOne Less Victim: A Prevention Guide"
4,Starting program 1st Jan 1999 - will keep you posted.,"I got my copy 4 years ago & have read it 4 or 5 times since then. The principles contained in the book make sense to me. The book is easy to follow with a natural progression through each of the subjects discused. It is going to be my reference manual for the coming months. I will measure the the value of the book by the results I achieve. This is one 281 pound, 40 year old male, about to test the product..... I will keep you posted."
1,Science quacks,"I too read and practiced Fit for Life several years ago, and found myself losing much weight quickly-too quickly. I now know I lost lean body mass because I was not assimilating enough protein and fat to rebuild cells so the building materials were being taken from existing muscle. This book, although seductive in its mantra of returning to a totally natural state, is not based upon any science at all. None of the theories propogated by the Diamonds concerning food combining have any CLINICAL basis in fact, and a high-school level understanding of human physioliogy and cellular transport blows holes in their reasoning. This is a diet which consumes all of your time and energy, and leaves you either fat and bloated from consuming food willy-nilly out of frustration, or skeletal and weak from insufficient amounts of protein."
5,Excellent Information For A Better Quality Of Life.,"All you have to do is to try this easy system for two or three days and you will be amazed. Who would think that something as ""healthy sounding"" as a turkey sandwich could actually have a somewhat toxic effect on your body? Instead, skip the bread and have a turkey and vegetable salad. It's all about ""proper food combining"". I can not understand why this system is not more ""mainstream"". All anyone has todo is try it for couple of days to experience ovewhelmingly positive results!"
1,FIT FOR THE TRASH,"It amazes me how people can write a book like this when they have no credentials or not even an ounce of common sense. Their logic in this book is over simplified, and generally innacurate. Ask any nutrionist, licensed dietician,endocrinologist what they think of the book and they will probably shake their head and walk away. If I could have gave it a lower score than ""1"" I would have. I hate to think that people have made the authors rich by buying this tripe."
4,Great overview on proper eating,"This is a very good book to get an understanding on how the digestive system works in simple layman's language. The book tells how it is best to eat within an eight hour span while the body focuses on the digesting process. Then the next eight hours the system focuses on assimilating. The last eight hours of the day the body focuses on eliminating. People usually eat breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks at night using up sixteen hours and never fully getting to the eliminating cycle. Stored toxins are unhealthy for you. The book also talks about proper food combining. Proteins need acid enzymes; carbohydrates need alkaline enzymes. If you eat the two together they cancel each other out and you end up with no food valve from what you ate. Vegetables go with anything. This book makes common sense. It's a life style way of eating, not a diet."
5,Fit for life,"A must have for healthy living that is easy to follow, very well written, and an eye opener. 5 stars I read this book several years ago and I saw it while shopping on Amazon and made the purchase."
5,The best start for a healthy lifestyle,"This book changed my life. It was the first health book I ever read, and to find so much vital data, explained so simply and down-to-Earth was truly amazing. The book really explains how you can improve your overall health by making a few simple changes in your eating habits, and believe me, if you are willing to try, you will be too pleased to go back to your old habits! The best part is that you can do this whethere you are a stay-at-home-mom or a busy executive, the changes are so simple that you can make them even if you are always in a hurry or if you eat out most of the time. And what will you get? More energy, like A LOT MORE, and a better functioning immune system, for starters. I am 25 years old and very healthy, but this book still helped me change my life for the better, so I am sure a lot of people who have more physical problems can be helped by reading and applying the principles in this book, too!"
5,It changed my life and way of eating. I am still fit,Fit for life is a great book as it is not a diet. I read it 10 years ago and to this day I recommend it to others. The best thing about Fit for Life is that it teaches you the mechanics of food combination and digestion.
1,Terrible...,"This book, assembled by a husband and wife team with no credentials _I_ can find in the book, is a load of poorly thought-out half-truths and some comments that border on irresponsibility. There's far too much to correct here, but a few gross misconceptions are the following: citrus fruits are not basic. They are acidic. Hence, citric and ascorbic acid. Finding ""basic"" or ""acidic"" foods is pretty pointless in the first place, as stomach juices are such strong acid it doesn't matter, and bases can harm as well (lye?). Also, protein does not leech calcium from bones. This is based on a study done in the 80's using protein _extracts_. They were, incidentally, reconstituted with milk - a calcium rich substance. This explains the increased urinary excretion."
2,Fit for Life made me tired all the time,"The book Fit for life, I tried it for awhile, deperate to be able to not feel hungry all the time like on other diets. What happened was I DID FEEL HUNGRY all the time. Just eating fruit in the morning did not give me any energy, I started to feel tired by lunch time. Then the choices you get to choose from, well it is hard to combine and really eat, especially when I also have to cut down on cholesterol and on a few meds. I just started to take the fruits and veggies, organic when possible, but have more regular meals and after a few days I feel better. Eating healthy, yes, stay away from processed foods. But food combining had me feeling lousy."
2,"Great if you are rich, and there is no proof that combinations of certain foods contribute to weight loss.","I read this book and, yeah I lost some weight, BUT this is a diet for people who have the time and can make the effort to stay on this diet. I found it WAY too restrictive. I have researched this kind of diet and there is no proof that consuming a certain combination of food will be healthier than a diet that doesn't have those restrictions. It's all about the calories and exercise, baby! I lost some weight but I am sick and tired of highly restrictive diet books, the preachy tone of the book, as if it performs miracles. People that I know who use this diet are almost cult-like in their devotion. It also costs a LOT of money to ""eat naturally"". I just don't have the money to buy free range chicken not to mention organic food. If organic food cost less I'd be eating it, but it doesn't. This diet is for rich people who don't have to work."
1,What? Are people still buying this baloney?,"I read this book 14 years ago, well before its laughable ""scientific"" assertions could be dismissed after a few minutes of Internet research. But this thing is still selling, and selling well? Good grief. Come on, try Googling ""food combining scientific basis"" before wasting your time and money."
3,Menopause experience,"I also had great results when I was in my 30's with Fit for Life. But trying it again in menopause, I've found it very difficult. I just can't feel good eating just fruit in the morning. After a few days of it, I start feeling really bad. What experience have others in menopause had with Fit for Life?"
4,Book Club Review- New edition is much better than the last,"We highly reccomend the new edition of the ""N...Word book"". The editing is much better than the first which reflected the originals grass roots and self published nature. The new version is a keeper if for no other reason than it's catacomb art of the ealiest known images of Jesus showing him being first worshipped as black. As hard as it seems for some outside the culture to believe, the myth of white superiority still holds a terrible grip on the minds of African Americans, especially our youth. Mr. Taylor's courage is commendable for taking on subjects that are whispered and not openly discussed between the races. Although it is not perfect,the content stimulates much needed discussion.Anita H.President of the Commonwealth Book Club"
1,no news is not good news,"This book is outrageously wasteful. Anyone who is likely to be interested in this topic will, in all likelihood, NOT believe these ""myths."" The issues presented are 1950's racist myths that no upstanding U.S. citizen would think hold any water. Anyone who might still put weight in these myths will NEVER purchase this book."
2,Too much,"I hate to be contrarian, but this was one of the worst books I have ever read. The author spends much of the book over-praising the genius of Buckminster Fuller, which should lead suspicious people to question what exactly is going on. It's possible that Mr. Fuller is the greatest genius of our time; but the author should simply show us his accomplishments, rather than say it. This style of over-inflated hype was so grating to me that I began to doubt whether Mr. Fuller had accomplished much of anything, a feeling re-inforced by the ridiculous jargon that he uses to obscure his ideas. I had hoped that this book would give me a glimpse of genius, but it ended up diminishing my view of Buckminster Fuller."
2,BAD PRODUCTION,"Boris Kodjoe plays Nigel Patterson, a former FB star. During a flashback we discovered Nigel is a hood who cheats at cards, throws games, and then he killed a man. His friend Danny Jackson takes the fall for Nigel on the promise he would take care of him when he got out. Well now Jackson is out and Nigel does not come close to meeting Danny's expectations. Danny eyes Nigel's wife Eden (Kenya Moore) and as our sympathy builds for Nigel, only then he destroys it by showing us he is a thug also. The movie escalates until it becomes stupid.The movie is low budget. It uses the same song for the soundtrack over and over again. The acting needed help as did the dialouge. If the merchandise is not stolen, you don't need to fence it to the Russian mafia. The overall idea for the script was sound, it was poorly executed on many levels.F-bomb, sex, nudity."
1,Seeing Boris was the only plus,This movie just wasn't that good. Boris is great to look at which kept me watching. Kenya is way prettier than she looked in the film. Some of the plot didn't make sense. Why not go to a legit pawn shop? Whey not sell the boat? Why did the housekeeper automatically pick up a knife? Just not good. There are way better low budget indi black films. Even the sexy scenes were lame. Pandora's Box and Motives 1 and 2 were better. Try those.
4,Good for Bravo RHHATL fans!,"This dvd may give Real Housewives of Atlanta fans some insight on the work of Kenya Moore, a former Miss USA, as an actor and producer.Even though it's a ""B"" movie that I'm guessing never hit the movie screen, it's enjoyable enough to honor credit for her efforts as a business woman.Smitten by her delusionary persona as a newly added member of the cast from Bravo's RHHATL season five, I caught an episode where she mentions this DVD to Phaedra and Apollo as a pitch to convince them that she is worthy of being hired to produce their workout video on how to acquire a donkey booty.There afterwards I couldn't resist making this purchase to get a glimpse of her capabilities.Granted this movie is not Oscar material which I didn't expect, I'm pleased to add it to my DVD collection."
1,Who is my pimp - Risky role play - NOT Good Acting,"Just saw the Moor Produce, starting Kenya Moore - her acting was very bad - even the wiggs was awful. Sister really need to take acting class she was out of her class being around Boris and David Banner - weh ws powerful and with very skill acting. Looking for more thing from David Banner, love is song. It is very nice seeing our folks, but get the right folks - Produce by Kenya Moor, actign by Kenya Moore and it's A Moor vision media production. This is a c move or DVD with A actor of Boris Koojjse and Richard Roundtree along with David Banner. This ws not worh my while and a waste of my time. I thought Kenya Moore did not live up to the acting that was needed for this production. The sets was lacking for a first class home. A very bad movie."
5,Awesome,I am very happy with this movie I bought the price was good and it was an entertaining movie enjoyed it
5,Totally surprised,"This is a great movie and it totally surprised me with the actors portrayal of each character and the story line and plot. I'm a DVD movie buff and it is had to please me in the movie arena, so many poor acting movie creations and low self-esteem in actor's charactor fulfillment. I knew Boris Kodjoe could act, but, wasn't sure about the supporting actors' abilities. And this is where the surprise came in, each supporting actor, played their roles gracefully and with good acting ability and self-esteem and to my delite, the movie was one of the best out there. Compliments to the writers and videographers and Director(s). I will recommend and compliment you guys on a job well-done (5-stars)."
1,This is not Planet P,"Beware, if you are looking for a Planet P fix don't buy this CD. I do not understand why this CD is listed under Planet P but it is. This CD is nothing but 5 techno dance tracks that sound nothing like Planet P or Tony Cary."
2,Three weeks of use.,"For me, the case is useless without the belt clip--I carry around too much other stuff in my pockets to feel comfortable putting my iPod in there. It took three weeks for the cheaply made, one-piece plastic clip to snap, rendering the case unusable. With a better clip design, this would be a decent case--slim and unobtrusive, although it picks up grime pretty quickly.With the current clip, though, I can't recommend it at all."
2,inexpensive basic book about fencing.,"this book is technically accurate in its athletic mechanical descriptions. however, the conclusion and history is remedial at best. this book is the mechanical basics an instructor should have memorized and have on recall for lessons. 20 years ago it was an ideal text book for collegiate fencing class. now the average internet search yields more info. but its price is right."
4,"Very good book, very different from the first two in the trilogy","I thought this David Freer book was very good, but was definately different from the first two books in the trilogy. It used the main characters from the first two books, but the focus was far more on working small magics than the others were. Overall I would suggest it as an interesting continuation of the characters"
2,Just not as good....,"After reading _Shadow_ and _Rough_, I was terribly excited to continue the saga of the Heirs of Alexandria.Unfortunately, I was sorely disappointed. The writing plodded at the speed of a glacier, and yet slammed rough-shod over the more interesting scenes. Perhaps by removing it from the glistening waters of the Mediterranean, the sparkle of the writing went with it.Character point of view slipped sloppily, making it difficult to understand through whose non-wry mental commentary the tale was coming. I couldn't muster concern for the characters, even the over-sized and rakish Manfred.I hoped for shimmer, but saw only lackluster."
2,Returned two within the warranty period already,"The monitor works great when it works.I just can't recommend it because I've had two monitors now show the same defect (interlaced vertical lines of the wrong colors, flickering edges/pixels on shapes, even when disconnected from the PC) before the 3-year warranty has expired. Sony is great in that they will exchange the monitor with a refurbished monitor -- and pay for FedEx shipping -- but since they replace it with the exact same model, if there is a common defect in the design (which, in this case, only seems to show up after about a year of use), I'm not sure what the recourse will be after the warranty expires."
4,Han's got a book of his own!,"Well, that dashing,daring, and devoius Han Solo has done it again. More excitement, more adventure! Being an avid Star Wars fan, I've spent most of my free time reading and re-reading this book. I love it! I would recomend this to any Star Wars fan, young or old. I tried to get multiple opinions in this book by my friends, and it seems that if you don't know a lick about Star Wars, you probably won't understand some of this book. But if you are familiar with SW, Hang On!! You're on for a pretty wild ride. Now, I will admit it, there are a few parts in there where I felt kind of. . . uh. . . sleepy. ..(Maybe I stayed up longer than I thought reading it. . ) but the abundance of action and suspence quickly banish it away. All in all, I would say this is a very good book.Some might say Han is just to brave (or to stupid) to be realistic. But, as Han would say, ""Hey, its Me!"""
2,It's Okay,"While the plot and the script follow the excellent book upon which this is based fairly well, the end results fall short of the mark.Jessa looks kinda like she's described in the book, but the other characters aren't really recognizable, even Han and Chewie. While the ship renditions are fairly good, the only thing they got right was the Falcon -- there weren't any TIEs in the novel, and those little fighters in the comic aren't Z-95s.The art is too childish, and the words are too big, and the coloring and detail is a bit dull. Still, all of this is somewhat overcome by a fairly exciting story and a fast pace.Another plus is the low price. If you're into Star Wars, it's worth the money."
2,Phrasebook?,"This is much more a dictionary than a phrasebook. I found it quite useless for my purposes. I subsequently bought a Barron's phrasebook, which was much more useful."
4,Interesting read,"This was written in the late 1800s and has a large number of accounts of the last days or hours of people. The sincere Christian will appreciate the material encouraging, reminding one of the importance of his/her honorable faith and service on this side of the grave. But the atheist and those Christians who don't believe in hell will find it ""malarkey."" Some of the accounts are a bit difficult to read because of the late 19th century writing style and word usage. I am about half way through the book."
1,Total Nonsense,"What a load of malarkey. These stories of death-bed conversions, and proof of the after-life (heaven and hell) are so preposterous, as to stretch credulity to the limits of human imagination. The Rev. Shaw provides no evidence that any of these stories are anything but complete fiction. Rev. Shaw has 6 year olds who have been run over by trains sounding like 30-year old Presbyterian Ministers. He occasionally adds known historical personalities and then fictionalizes there last few moments, in order to convince true believers that one can glimpse the after-life in the last few moments of life. Anyone who believes these stories are true, I have a bridge to sell you."
5,Excellent Replacement Mirror! Perfect Match/Great Quality/Priced Right!,"Ordered mirror assembly from K Source after searching for affordable alternative to overpriced dealership item. Mirror is exactly as described, was packed very well and arrived quickly, as promised. Looking for a new/replacement mirror? Look into a K-Source mirror! You'll like what you see!"
4,Pinoeer Remote,"Had no problems on the instalation, I bought two for diferent pioneer car stereos in one (Mazda 99 Steering Wheel)I had no problems. On the other one (Mitsubishi 04 Steering Wheel), it sometimes works other times it doesn't, have tried a lot of postions but nothing. Will have to keep trying."
3,Just an extra. Not a necessity.,I found this remote to be fairly simple to setup considering it didn't need any programing to use it. My biggest complaint is using all of the functions on the remote is not at all easy to do. I'm not sure if it had compatibility issues with the head-unit in my car but it was a pain. I'm almost thankful my car was broken into and the radio was stolen so that I can start over with a different brand and system. I would not recommend this remote to anyone unless they absolutely needed a remote.
2,sorry could you speak up!,"I got this for a few reasons. Dan Akroyd does a voice, its from the 70s and I had never heard of it before. I would tell you what it is about but I really am not sure. The reason is because you can hardly understand the voices at all. Seriously it is almost impossible to understand half of what they are saying. I mean I paid less than 2 dollars for it. So it's fine with me. I am also keeping it because of the reasons I got it. But it's hard to give it a better raiting.There are some ld cartoons on after the main one though. Which adds to the experience. You can understand the other cartoons well."
2,A Fun Read,"A book of advice - some of it fair, some of it fairly awful. I don't like the fact that it is set up as a landscape book (i.e. as if it came from a power point presentation) but that doesn't disqualify it. And for the price - $0.99 it is worth having in your Kindle."
5,Amazing product!,This product is one of the most daily essentials to my overall health and wellbeing. If you want a vital healthy bodyI highly recommend this product.
1,Painful thing,"After reading all great reviews here and in David Wolfe ""Eating for Beauty"" book, i was excited to order it. So, it arrived. I take 1/4 teaspoon as recommended for the beginners. 30 minutes later i get bad stomach pain, which doesnt go away for 3 days. Ok...maybe coincidence. Doing it next time - same result. Very very sad. Sending it back."
2,overall disappointing,"I have listened to all types of Christian music for nearly 25 years, and like all of the guys who make up this group, however this cd lacks innovation and inspiration. The only tracks worth getting are ""Learning to Believe,"" and ""Gotta Serve Somebody."""
3,Land of the Blue Poppy,"Travel at the turn of the 20th century was so different from today. There were places virtually unexplored. People and customs seemed strange. This reproduction must be read with historical perspective in mind. But by today's standards the story is slow and plodding, like his trek. We don't really get the excitment of some of the harrowing experiences he encountered. The descriptions of the plants was limited but his descriptions of the overall terrain was detailed enough so that you could imagine what it was like."
1,Digitalized copy and difficult return instructions,"I was unaware that digitalized copies of books were being sold. I purchased a this book for a gift, when I recieved it (about 3 weeks later), longer than I expected, I hated the type and copy, harsh and ugly print, very unsuitable for a gift. That was not in the description. Also, I found the return instructions complicated and asking for a return in unopened and original packing. How could you do this if you opened it and found it not to your satisfastion? I will wait to see if they credit me because I expect more complications."
5,The most useful text I've found,"There's an awful lot of books out there purporting to be written by ""the experts"" regarding alcoholism and drug addiciton. Very few of them provide any useful insights into how the families of those suffering from Chemical Dependency can find the help they so badly need. In this book Stephanie Brown and her colleagues put their many years of research and experience together in a format that is easily understood and more perhaps more importantly that can be put into practice. She demystifies and gives language to concepts and ideas that can be baffling and overwhelming to families in crisis. The stages of recovery from active use through early recovery and the trauma that involves, moving through to ongoing recovery issues, are explained clearly, highlighting how the family ""system"" is affected and tools the family can use to navigate each stage.I loved this book, it helped me make sense of my own alcoholic family in a way no other book has been able to."
2,mild A&C,"Long awaited on DVD not a classic a few good routines, but too many songs and love interest drags out the movie."
3,Good but limitations,"This DVD recorder is a good choice if you want an upconvert DVD player with the ability to record. It provides a better playback image with an HDTV and you can record shows that you want to save. You should be aware that it has every copyright protection feature available. You will not be able to copy most DVD's and I have found it is unable to copy any movies from the movie channels (HBO, Cinemax, Starz, and Showtime). It will however let you know that the movies are boadcast with copy protection and shut down so you don't waste a blank DVD. Also be aware that it doesn't have it's own tuner so your cable or satelite box must be set to the channel you want to record (you can't watch one channel while recording another). You can set it up so the timer will change your set top box to the channel you want to record. All in all a decent product and if you're aware of the limitations and can live with them you won't be dissapointed."
1,"Don't even bother, Sony takes another step backwards","I knew beforehand this unit didn't have a tuner so I assumed there would be great input jacks so I can plug in my satellite receiver. Man was I wrong! There is only 1 video input and its composite! Who uses composite inputs anymore? I was hoping for at least an S-Video input jack. I tried recording with the composite input and the picture quality was only average. The only way to record anything with this unit is through the singular composite input. Also, this unit WILL NOT record any premium cable channels whatsoever. It will only record basic cable channels. So this unit is totally useless to me. Sony was once a premier electronics company but now they are just cranking out low level inferior electronics. There is also no HDMI cable included. This thing is made in China, it figures.."
1,DON'T EXPECT MUCH FROM THIS RECORDER,"Don't get me wrong, it's a GREAT DVD ""player"" and I bought it to replace a DVD player so I am kind of happy (expected more). BUT it is virtually useless as a recorder for what most of us want a recorder for and that is what we used a VHS for. We are not pirates, we want to keep a show for later viewing, ""at our leisure"". Technology is supposed to make our lives better, not handcuff us. This unit has such an aggressive copy guard don't expect to be able to record many, if any, shows from premium cable channels to watch at a future time. I have multiple series 3 Tivo HDs that I use for doing that, but if I wanted to archive a show and record it to this unit, I CAN'T, shame on you Sony! I was a BIG Sony fan, every TV, VCR and DVD player I own is Sony. Well that time is gone and since this purchase and because of this issue my technology dollars are going elsewhere!"
1,Sony takes another step backwards in technology.,"Sony takes another step backwards in technology.i am a pro in SONY, this my favorite brand.but my deception is the excess of Copy protection, i dont able to record movie to watch later/timeshifting. this unit live in my house in less of 24 hours, returning to store.I HAVE A QUESTION, what is the best DVD+R to record tv show, I AM NOT PIRATE!. THANKS."
2,reducing the cost?,"I bought this Sony recorder because of it's beautiful design,ease of use and sony quality.I am not the one to record shows from tv.that's why I didn't care for tuner.But to my surprise.this is the first player that I noticed DOES NOT SHOW you the TRACK number!isn't it strange? even the cheapest $29 player has this feature.what do you think dear Sony? Unfortunately I had to return it.Did you really mean to reduce the cost?"
1,Don't wast your money of Sony RDR-GX355,"This unit was a waste of money. It boasts big features and has wonderful quality of video and audio, when it works that is. Forget watching a two hour movie on it. About 90 minutes into the movie it starts to pause and break up because it is over heating inside or somehting. It sets on a shelf with nothing under it or on top of it. You have to take a thirty minute break with the player turned off to finished the movie again. Recording is horrible also. When you get a disk to work, you end up with a copy protection error. Sony is sure not what they used to be. I used to have the upmost faith in thier products, but now, Made in China, Sony is no better that the rest of the low priced walmart junk.Save your money and buy somehting else."
1,Don't Buy This!,"This unit will not allow you to record movies, anything from HBO, it simpy isn't worth anything. There has to be a solution, but so far I haven't been able to record much at all.Sorry my review is so short, I see many others have the same concerns as I, I just wanted to add my ""voice""."
3,Broken down after 4 months. wont read any disks,"I was pretty happy with it - while it worked. After 4 months it stopped reading disks. Spits them all out and says disk error.Update. It was still under warranty when it broke. Had to live without it for a few weeks, and hassled with some shipping, but they made it right. I have been pretty happy with it since. Very happy when you consider how low the price was."
5,great machine in a very small package,"I bought this product just a few hours ago. I asked the manager at the store if I could return it if I was not satisfied. Well, to tell the truth, I am so satisfied that I think this is worth more than the $ that I paid for it. I can pick up loud noises almost 4 rooms (in a house) away and I can easily pick up regular voices from 25-30 feet and have near perfect clarity. It gets a little softer as you move further away but it is definately a good investment."
3,"Big Sound, Big Price","Lorin Maazel produces a big, pompous rendition of this Moussorgsky classic, presumably for the ""Sound Surround"" audience. Sounds good, but the price of the CD is twice what a technically more conventional recording would be. Is it worth it? Only the buyer can tell, but beware! Unless you own the special equipment, stick with another recording."
3,Uninspiring!,"Great music! However this CD is particularly uninspiring. Apparently there's a reason there are jokes about Cleveland.I must own six or eight albums of Pictures (orchestral and piano) and this is the second to the worst. All my others are on vinyl and this is my only CD. As for Horowitz's version, stay away at all costs. As someone has previously stated, he sprayed graffitti all over the score. His treatment of the Great Gate of Kiev would have made a second year piano student blush with embarrassment for the craft. I've heard house rock bands improvise better music than that."
4,Regional Powerhouse: The Greater Pearl River Delta and the Rise of China,"The book, ""Regional Powerhouse: The Greater Pearl River Delta and the Rise of China"" is a great resource for anyone who would like to understand the Pearl River Delta region of mainland China, but it does repeat itself a bit. It reads as though the authors all submitted different chapters, and no one checked to see if the material overlapped. However, the authors are highly knowledgeable, and the graphs and statistics really help the reader to grasp the eminent importance of the Greater Pearl River Delta region."
5,my Favorite boxset,"first off, to all the people who wrote in and said the dvd is not good WHAT DID YOU EXPECT? THE HOLY GRAIL IN THE FORM OF A DVD? THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST PERFORMANCES I'VE SEEN & HEARD.granted jonas does not look terribly happy to be there, but he sounded great.while i, too, got all the studio albums the day they came out i had to get this collection (mainly for the dvd...which does not dissapoint)but also for the unreleased songs...nothing about this set let me down (although i would like to have seen an interview or video on the dvd).FOR ANY FAN OF KATATONIA-DON'T MISS OUT.a lot of it is redundant, but the rest is fantastic."
4,Sho Shmoove,Dish peesh of masheenerie ish sho shmoove. Shtraining feelsh like shteering a rachecar. Sheerioushlie!
3,Doctrin without Life's Integrity is useless.,"Shamed on us if we think that we ""know"" God without live in His integrity. No matter is your stream, nevertheless, we will stand before Him on judgment for every thing what we had done and we had. So go back to your life and live as a christian with integrity (including your doctrines)."
3,"A strong philosophy, but weak on Biblical substance","Overall, I felt this book was philosophically challenging, but was deficient in its biblical case. On top of that, all of the biblical cases presented seemed to be confused and/or jumbled to the point of being a non-argument. I personally agree with the author's point of view, but I also think that Greg Boyd did a MUCH better job in ""God of the Possible"". Read this book for philosophy, and God of the possible for a more Biblical case."
4,A major challenge to Calvinism,"For the most part I found this book to be quite intellectually stimulating and a major challenge to the Calvinist point of view. The editor did a good job of assembling articles that represent the spectrum of opinions within the Arminian camp.A few of the extreme positions I don't agree with. But most of the book is very good. I. Howard Marshall's article on the pastoral epistles and William L. Craig's piece on middle-knowledge are both excellent. But I was particularly impressed with Terry Miethe's article, ""The Universal Power of the Atonement."" This is a major personal interest of mine. For a book-length work on this issue (written by a British Puritan Arminian theologian) I recommend ""Redemption Redeemed: A Puritan Defense of Unlimited Atonement"" by John Goodwin."
2,Way too much emotionalism for my liking.,"Too much emotionalism, too little Bible is why I give this book only 2 stars. The problem is that Pinnock and others have gone off the deep end in their loathing of Calvinism and have denied to God some of His basic attributes as given in the Bible. I agree that God does change His mind, but this does not have to imply that He is not omniscient. But as I said, this book presents a glut of emotionalism when it should be presenting a glut of Bible. I wish Mr. Pinnock and others had done a better job of presenting a case against Calvinism, as it is not hard to do if you know your Bible."
2,"Lot of hits, but...","...the problem is that the tracks are cut so that each song bleeds into the next, which is great for playing at parties, but bad if you want to record your own mixes. Trying to ""stitch"" the parts together doesn't always work either, so if you want to mix your own, find another compilation."
1,This listing is very deceptive,"I've ordered twice from vendors who show this listing as a Sound Choice product and both time I got same title by All Star Karaoke, they're two completely different products. Sellers need to check what they're selling against the product listing before selling."
2,Nothing special,"I have oily, acne-prone skin and found this product to sort of leave a film on my face. It did nothing to clear my skin, but it might be good for someone who wants a bit of exfoliation and has sensitive skin.."
1,Nothing New,"This product is nothing diffrent than what you can find at any retail store. It's not smooth to rub in, like most specialty exfoliants. I recommend this product for your knees and elbows only."
1,Why,The Question is why did Irv Gotti take the production he usedon Jay Z 1st album to give it for this crappy rendition of theGreat Jay Z song she tampers with another classic.Lyrics 1/10 Production 3/10 Overall 2/10
4,UFO's Raymond shows he's not just a keyboard player!,Good songwriting and playing. Bluesy hard rock stuff.Nothing super great but very good. I should have gotthis sooner. I like Raymond's vocals very scratchycool sounding. If you like UFO or classic rock thenyou should get this. it's not UFO but it's good.
2,Gotten kinda boring after volume3,"I really gotten kinda board of burst angel i mean theres nothing really different about it, just girls with big guns big robots and partial nudity i gooten board of that and the show started to get really whack, plus they made only 6volums and the best one was volume1 but i really don't care about that volume anymore, so this was an okay series nothing really speacial."
5,I really loved it. A fun old book that really teaches well,"It's not perfect, it can be a little corny, but if used with a good teacher or approached with the right attitude, this stuff is superb. One of the best approaches to learning to read notes on guitar, period. Lots and lots of enjoyable music. Certainly best with a teacher, of course. And I'd definitely go through the four books in order. Alfred's Basic Guitar books 4-6 are good too as follow ups (or the old 1959 edition of those as companions to the New Guitar course too, but the new editions of ABG are worse). It's really wonderful that these are still in print."
3,Not up to Lawhead's standards,"'Avalon' never quite delivers what the dustjacket promises. True, it's a story of the modern incarnation of Arthur, but it's a plot point barely referred to. Lawhead occasionally devotes a few paragraphs to the rebirth, but outside of those few pages this might as well be a political novel.I question Lawhead's abolition of the monarchy storyline. He could have written a much more engaging novel based on the return of Arthur idea without it. I would have preferred Arthur physically returning from wherever he's been than a protagonist only casually aware that he used to be King Arthur.The characters are well-drawn. There are no gaping plot holes (outside of the unnaturally evil British PM). This is a well-written book, but just as Lawhead's previous novel 'The Iron Lance' did, this one falls a tad short."
3,Disappointing,"I was anxious to read the final installment of the Arthur series. Disappointed in bad language and some other crudities, departing from the tone of the previous books in the series. Good story line though. Would not recommend it, especially to younger readers."
4,This is one of my favorite books,"Stephen Lawhead has created a modern-day Arthur that is worthy of the name. So many times the Arthur as written is so flawed you wonder why anyone ever followed him in the first place. This Arthur is real, but honorable, and has a great supporting cast. Merlin is here, doing his usual behind-the-scenes machinations, and Jenny, Arthur's love. Fun book."
4,Fitting Conclusion to Lawhead's Arthurian Epic,"Avalon is the final book in Lawhead's wonderful Pendragon series. Unlike the other books in the series, it is set during conteporary times when England is threatened by an evil so great that only a revitalized monarchy can save it. Enter James Arthur Stuart, an army officer, who is told by an old man named Merlin that he is the legitimate heir to the throne. It turned out that he was conceived in secret and his existence hidden, raised by a foster family, in much the same way as King Arthur was. Lawhead adds contemporary versions of Arthur's knights and advisors as well as his enemies. Sometimes this book gets lost in Lawhead's rather grandiosse style which fits much better with the ancient rather than the contemporary, but overall, this is an enjoyable and interesting novel. A fitting conclusion to the King Arthur story."
3,SPELLING MISTAKES! Kindle Edition,I love this author and I've really enjoyed the Pendragon series. This book is a different sort of finish that I found quite interesting.I would have loved it a lot more if there weren't so many spelling errors! There was at least one spelling mistake per page throughout the entire book. Come on!
2,Could have done better,"I really enjoy Mr. Lawhead's books but this was was not nearly as good as any of his other books. The characters were cardboard and the plot limps along the first half then takes off for a while then limps again. I kept waiting for the PM Waring to show a really evil side or Merlin to do something special. Even worse is the last few pages smack of sequel then suddenly ends. It's not a satisfying book, great idea that wasn't fully realized."
3,Worth the reading...,"I enjoyed this book very much (but then Arthurian fiction is my favorite). I was sceptical at first because very often this type of book doesn't translate well into modern times, but this one pulls it off very well. The end is a little lame but all in all I'd say it's worth the reading!"
1,Disappointing Read from Lawhead,"Stephen Lawhead is one of my favorite fantasy / fiction writers - but Avalon is a plodding read that, unfortunately, felt like he was fulfilling a publishing contract rather than writing from his heart. There's little characterzation or drama - and I kept reading page after page waiting for the story to kick in...which it never did. For ""classic"" Lawhead, start the Song of Albion trilogy (The Paradise Wars is book one)."
3,Bland Cliches,"Stephen Lawhead has always been hit and miss with me. Some of his books I've really enjoyed (The Song of Albion series), others not so much (The Celtic Crusades). This book falls into the ""not so much"" category. The characters are bland, cardboard cut-outs of previous incarnations; the motivation behind many of the characters is thin at best; and the writing seems like it was called in. If you're a Lawhead fanatic, you'll love this book. If you're a fan of Arthurian legends, there are better choices out there."
2,"An interesting premise, but not fully realized.","An interesting premise, but not completely drawn out. The characters are one dimensional and the plot is not logical."
3,"Fascinating ""King Arthur returns"" tale","Stephen R. Lawhead has done an admirable job re-telling the Arthrurian legend in his previous novels (Taleisin, Merlin, Arthur, Pendragon, Grail; all excellent reading).In ""Avalon,"" he brings back the ""Once and Future King"" in a sequel to those adventures. In the 21st Century, the British monarchy is on the verge of being wiped out politically, and a scheming Prime Minister looks to consolidate his power. Only Merlin and a reincarnated Arthur can save the day. While you get an interesting look inside British politics, and some nice set pieces as, ""Arthur"" begins to accept his new role, this does fall a bit short of the previous Lawhead novels. Enjoyable, but not essential."
2,A fun romp,"A somewhat isolated book of the Pendragon Series which borrows a few key personalities from the series and brings them ~1500 years ahead to the current time. The characters are transparent, the plot is fairly predicable, and the climax was not. No sword clashing or epic battles, and a small and shallow romance thrown in for spice.With all that in mind, read it for purely entertainment purposes. Set your mind in the same mood as when you watch an action movie, with no real expectations beyond that, and it is an enjoyable read that you'll devour fairly fast, then put it away and forget within a few days."
3,Lacklustre End to an Epic Series,"The Pendragon cycle is a wonderful set of books, full of fresh ideas and good research to make an epic blend of myth, history and religion that is a powerful antidote to the pessimistic offerings of some other writers.But this book is not the best of the series. Set a generation in the future, it posits a kind of modern Britain that acts in a way that is frankly unthinkable. Lawhead has worked hard to research British politics for this novel, but there are some big gaps all the same.A problem with speculative fiction set in the near future is that the future will invariably be nothing like what is envisaged.Nevertheless Lawhead should be congratulated on even attempting a novel that delves so deeply into the British political situation, and as usual he writes it well and the story is often gripping. For all its faults, it is still a good read."
2,Arthur doesn't translate well to modern times,"This book is probably fun for Lawhead fans. Lawhead keeps the suspense going until the end, although the constant dustups with Morgan Le Fay are a bit predictable. The thesis of the book is pretty bizarre, however. The book goes on and on about how the solution to the problems of modern society (bad government, immorality, just plain evil) are to be found in the divine right of kings. This part is pretty hard to swallow and kind of ruined the book for me."
5,"""Circle of Iron"", A Zen Production","This film has been enjoyed by my family since it first appeared on television when my son was quite young. We taped it on our first VCR on its first tape and viewed it regularly. My son and I often use the quotes from David Carradine's character, wiggling them into normal conversations. When I saw that ""Circle of Iron"" had been release on DVD, I could not resist."
4,Philosophy as a Fist,"1979. HBO is still struggling to make it. It's 2:30AM, am I'mup watching cable because it's a new toy and I'm half drunk. 'Circle of Iron' is on.I'll admit I probably couldn't appreciate the iconagraphy back then, but I did understand the visuals were meant to signify other things. Eli Wallach enjoying a bath of boiling oil sticks out in particular. Every battle the main character fights is meant to open his awareness.Battle as education. Probably better than any other technique we're using now, from the looks of things."
4,Wow!,"I saw part of this when I was ten years old, and spent the next ten years trying to find a copy. I am not a kung fu/Bruce Lee fan, but this is definitely my favorite kung fu movie. I'm sure it's been watered-down, Hollywood style, but it's still a great adventure story that's full of valuable life lessons. If you want an education in Zen Buddhism, this probably isn't the place to get it. If you want a fun and very DIFFERENT sort of adventure story that prompts you to look at the world differently, this is a great one. It's a good kung fu movie for people who don't like kung fu movies.And yes, I'm sure Bruce Lee is rolling in his grave, but I still find David Carradine very entertaining."
4,Well plotted but fairly long storyline.,"Back in the eighties, when I first saw the movie, I was stunned that a fairly unknown actor was playing the main character of Cord while David Carradine was seen more of a supporting role, but then I began to understand the underlining msg that Carradine's characters brought forth. The most memoriable sub-story was when Cord and the Blind Man entered a village that honored a young and handsome boy as a prince based only on his physical beauty and the outcome after Carradine's intervention. This scence was a very astute perciption of how our society, as a whole, deal with the young and beautiful. While the Pink Floydd movie The Wall is considered to be a must see for true rockers, the Circle of Iron should be a must see for serious martial artists that are on the journey towards enlightenment versus martial artists that only journey for competition thropies."
2,Nostolga not always a good thing,Saw this movie as a kid and loved it. Got it to see if it held up and really it doesn't. The martial arts are dated and not that extensive. Filmed on location in various places the scenery is nice and the cinematography is above average but the whole move seems dated. Two stars.
4,RIP David Carradine,David Carradine will forever be linked to Kung Fu but this movie should not be far behind.
2,"Story is fine, actors are HORRIBLE...","This ranks up there with some of the worst acting I have ever seen. I love martial arts flicks but why put a goofy hair white male in the role of seeker? He is such a BAD actor. It made the movie laughable which is frustrating b/c I expected a good serious movie. The story line is fine although it had its absurdities as well (male sitting in oil for 11 years b/c he couldn't trust himself not to accept a vow of chastity. Overall, I would avoid this movie like any flu pandemic. There are plenty of decent movies that actually have decent (notice I am implying that the ""fight"" scenes were pathetic) fight scenes."
4,"a good select, only miss the german language","Hi,the product is o.k., I`d like to buy some with more languages, specialy german, because my english is not so good. It`s a pitty, that it doesn`t exist in this marketplace.greetings -- lothar"
2,Great read...flawed digitization,"This is a book I was happy to see made available in the Kindle store, as I'd read it before. I love that it's now digitized, but there was apparently no copy editing done, and some of the machine conversion of text is quite flawed. For example, about one third of the time, Pope Paul is ""Pope Paid."" Huh? Really? If Amazon were to fix the editing mistakes in the book, I'd give it four stars. Alas, as it is I'd only award two stars."
3,misspelled words,Why so many misspelled words? For pages on end Pope Paul is called Pope Paid! We'd never accept such sloppiness in a traditional printed book.
2,Buyer beware,"A bit of a disappointment - although the individual interviews are interesting, they are conducted in such a non-critical way that they amount to little more than a potted biography of each of the interviewees. Not very challenging intellectually, and does little to illuminate non-duality effectively.In addition, the latest printing of this book DOES NOT contain an interview with Byron Katie, despite what the blurb says on here."
1,Uncritical rapture,"What prevents me to appreciate this book is the servile base flattery which is penetrating all over the pages. Each and every teacher is praised by the authors in a complete uncritical way. This makes the interviews monotonous, and the portrayed persons somewhat unpleseant since everybody seems to accept this keen servility and praise. Furthermore: the authors's questions and remarks, printed in full lenght, which makes readings boring, give a ""me too""-impression: ""Me too, I've had deep insights, me too, I've already found wisdom, me too""...I recommend the very honest and captivatingly written book by Paula Marvelly: partly the same teachers but a very different quality. After reading it gets clearer whom of the teachers one would like to listen to and whom not. This makes it far more interesting and helpful than ""Awakening in the West"": Easily available via the British Amazon site."
5,Excellent front hitch receiver,"The item is extremely well constructed and easy to install. On top of that, it had the lowest price. I highly recommend Curt Manufacturing!"
1,Bottle malfunction,I am not sure why the design of the bottle would not allow the pellets to come out. Really aggravating when I would like to use the product! Such a bad introduction to homeopathy. I've requested replacement or refund.
2,Could have been better,"This book could be a good starting place for those interested in reading about women mathematicians, but Perl places too much emphasis on these women as wives as mothers. For instance, the greater part of Grace Chisholm Young's biography was dedicated to her role as mother and wife. Only a short amount of Young's biography was dedicated to her math research and publications. I found this very disturbing,and, honestly quite an insult to these outstanding and courageous women. I also think it sends the wrong message to those women aspiring to be career mathematicians, that no matter how much you accomplish as a mathematician, you will always be thought of first as a wife and mother."
3,great boat!,"I think this is a very fast,durable,and reliable.My friend for example,has a tyco Arrow.but when I showed him the super cruiser he was begging his parents to get one. the reason is the tyco only went two miles an hour!Overall,the super cruiser is a great boat."
4,Not so much fun,I recieved this Nikko Speedboat as a gift 3 months ago and I used it only a few times and the boat no longer works. My mom brought it back to the store where it was purchased and they would not exchange it for me. They had none in stock and would not give me a store credit or offer to order me one online! All I want is to get another one just like it so I can have FUNagain.
4,Some great classics and some lesser known favorites,"I bought this for my son and am delighted. It's wonderful to see some of these old classics on screen. It's also a time capsule with narrations from different eras. This is not a hi-tech set, but it's a great way to familiarize little ones with some great children's literature before they're able to read."
2,The sound quality is not good on mine.,"I was excited to get this collection of videos to use with my class in Kindergarten. However, It does include quite a few that I will not choose to use, and the sound quality is poor for some reason. I would not purchase it again in this package if I were to do it over."
4,Great Gift!,"We got this set as a gift and it really is a great set for toddlers and Pre-K-1st grade. One of our favorite books from Kinder reading (Gloria and Officer Buckle) was included. This particular story is funny to read but it is even funnier when you see the animation. One of our other favorites is the Dinosaur DVD, which includes How Dinosaurs Say Goodnight and other similar stories like Danny and the Dinosaur (K or first grade reader). We choose one DVD every few days and watch it together and it entertains both my kids (ages 3 and 6). It's wonderful when you already know the story, and sometimes it spurs interest in a book that maybe they haven't read yet but they liked the DVD so much they ask for it. I just love it!"
5,"Beautiful, high quality and quiet entertainment for preschoolers","In a Nick Jr./ Disney world where all the characters seem to shout, the music is often too loud and incomprehensible and the storylines are--- Wait! are there storylines?? (Wow, Wow Wubbzy comes to mind!)-- We have discovered this wonderful set of stories thoughtfully put together in a lovely, QUIET form of entertainment for our daughter. Although the animation quality is spotty throughout, overall the artistry of the original books shines through and the narrators provide a wonderful ""voice"" to these favorite books. Our favorite is the Chrysanthemum DVD. We've now worked through not just the videos but every book written by Kevin Henkes!"
1,Not what I expected,This is just the stories being read. I can do that. I thought I was buying video's of the books. Very disappointed. I might try to sell this. Definitely not worth the money.
4,toddler treasury,I bought this for 5 grandchildren and the toddlers loved it. I think the parents liked it more. It is like reading the stories to the kids and they can follow along if they have their own copy of the book (or from the library). It is the original art work with the narration and words so it is nice for early readers.
5,Really superb collection of animated storybooks,We purchased this for our kids for Christmas 2008 and it has been a big hit with them (and us). We have read most of the books already and it was fun to see them animated. This box set was a special buy around Christmas and a very good deal - but even at full price you get a huge number of great animated stories which are clean and (often) familiar.The picture quality ranges from great to 'ok' - but some of the stories have videos which are quite old.
3,"Heartwarming, but Not for Today's Children","These are wonderful stories brought to life via dvd. However, if you are expecting an animated wonderland to share with your children, you will be disappointed. Today's cartoons and animation is so far ahead and my grandchildren became bored with the stories, immediately. My suggestion, buy the books and read them to them to keep their interest."
1,Reading,"I watched the excerpts of the videos, but I must say that it is important to read to the children and we have our own ""Where the Wild Things Are"" reading rituals that would be changed by getting these videos. I guess I will just remain an old curmudgeon and believe that the best books should remain books to be read and enjoyed by me and my children. Not another of the endless videos watched and turning the kids into videodrones.""Where the Wild Things Are"" is one of the greatest children's books ever written. Read it."
4,"Cute, but...","These stories are cute, but have not held the attention of my 2 year old the way animated movies such as Monsters Inc., Toy Story, or Wall-e do"
5,Great stories,"I try to limit TV watching as much as possible, but these stories have become staples in our house. They're great for several reasons:1. The videos are drawn from good books, so the stories are all good2. Most of the animation is not too busy -- simple and traditional3. A lot of the music is really good. Just the Antarctica story alone has about 10 great songs that my kid loves to sing4. Each disk has bonus stories that are often as good (or better) than the headliners5. The stories are short, and so are perfect for limited-time wind-downsI have been impressed with the consistent quality of the set. Each disk has a different theme, but I have been very happy with all of them."
5,Absolutely Wonderful,"I purchased this for my grandkids, ages 4 and almost 2. They love these stories/videos. We watch a new one every week or so. They are entranced with Strega Nona and insist on seeing it at least two times a day. The video prompted me to purchase all the books about Strega Nona. This is a GREAT purchase for all grandparents."
5,Compare and Contrast,This Classic edition of well loved stories is a perfect choice for comparing and contrasting with the written story. I'd rather have my grandson watching these than watching mindless TV.
5,Love this set!!,"We haven't even watched all of them yet, but these have become my 2 1/2 year old daughter's favorite pick at bedtime. I love that we could watch a whole movie or limit the TV time to a single story. Since they are all favorite children's literature books, we are never disappointed. Well done, great buy!"
5,Treasury of 100 Storybook Classics,"The storybook classics have 100 stories with DVD's. It is amust-have for children. The books on the DVD's are the sameones read at school. The children love them, and the words atthe bottom of the DVD's help them to learn words...excellentreinforce skills that are extremely enjoyable. This is anexcellent product for children ages 5-8!!!!!"
5,Great Gift,"I bought these dvds as a Christmas gift for a nephew. I think he is going to love them. A lot of the classics my own children loved when they were young are included in this set, and I'm sure the next generation will enjoy them just as much."
5,Great for kids to watch,"With so much questionable content on TV, this is a great way to provide quality programs for your kids that are fun and are based on a book. Fun to and entertaining to watch too."
5,Kids love it. I love it - both as a parent and a viewer. Great value!,"I was skeptical about how the animated versions would measure up to the original print versions of the stories. I was amazed to see that the words and pictures are pretty much identical. Not sure how they do this exactly, but it's as if the books have come to life.Of course, watching a video is not a replacement for good, old-fashioned story time. However, I feel like this is a great option for those times when my kids do watch television. They are just nice, wholesome stories. I also think the animated versions can be a good way to enhance comprehension of a story, especially when you pair it with a reading and discussion of the printed version.I have a more detailed review of this DVD set on my blog, Healthy, Green and Frugal. Click here to read it:[...]"
1,Not what I thought,These video's were very boring for my 2 1/2 year old. I didn't realize it was just still shots of pictures. Would love to sell this and get some of my money back.
1,Below Expectation,"I thought its a 16 disc pack but I only receive 14 disc. The two missing discs are:Disc 5: Chicka Chicka Boom Boom...and more fun with letters and numbers! (Chicka Chicka Boom Boom, Five creatures, wild about books, inch by inch, blueberries for Sal, A story-a story, millions of cats) ; andDisc 14: I Stink! ... and more stories on wheels (I Stink!, Mike. Mulligan and his Steam Shovel, Trashy Town, The Remarkable Riderless Runaway Tricycle, The Beast of Monsieur Racine, and Arnie the DoughnutBut when I emailed them, they say its a 14 disc packAre there many variations/packages under the same title ?"
5,scholastic 100 storybook DVD's,"We haven't looked at all of them yet but the ones we saw are well done and hold the interest of the grandchildren. I especially like that the words are ""tracked"" as the DVD plays."
2,A different brand than listed,"Works fine, all specs are what were listed, but I did not receive an Arri brand lamp. Instead I got one made by Ushio. I specifically ordered the Arri because I wanted precise color temperature and recognize Arri as a manufacturer of professional photo/film equipment. I could have gotten a generic brand for cheaper. The seller should take the 10 seconds required to update the brand name on the product page."
3,Different product received,"I was looking for the advertised mouthwash, so I chose also based on the picture. The mouthwash I received was still from Dr.Ken's but a completely different one, in packaging and taste. Not sure if this is the update product and they simply forgot to change the picture, but make sure to clarify that before purchasing. The product I got it's from the same brand and completely natural so, after all, I am quite happy to give 3 stars but, considering I was expecting another product I'd give 2."
4,Australia,"AUSTRALIA THE BEAUTIFULDISCOVERING AUSTRALIAAUSTRALIA - THE LAND BEYOND TIMEThese movies are all informative, and Australia itself is of course gorgeous. Some people seem to think the only things in Australia are kangaroos, koalas, Aborigines, Crocodile Dundee, and Steve Irwin feeding his baby to the crocodiles. Students in China will ask you ""What is the weather like in Australia?"" as if a country roughly the size of China or the USA has the same weather from east to west and north to south. These films will show you otherwise, but it is annoying that I can't find a single DVD about Australia made by Australians. These are distinctly American, even though the third has a British narrator."
4,"Wonderful nature film, but where are the people?","This is indeed a marvelous set of films about the wild and wonderful places of Australia. The nature coverage is top-notch and I'd highly recommend it for that content. However, I was greatly disapponted to find that there was no coverage of Austalia's cities and people. This gave a very incomplete picture of what I was hoping to see, so I would suggest that the product description be updated to make the content clearer."
5,Australia the Beautiful,I bought this for my daughter because it is her dream to move to Australia. The movie is wonderful. I knew that it would be because it is from Reader's Digest.
4,Exactly as advertised,I ordered this for my son to wear for a school project presentation on Japan. He and his fellow classmates loved the outfit.
5,agreeing with the reader from New York,"I read the review written by someone from New York. I was surprised that he or she had the same feelings about the book as I had. This is a shocking book. On the one hand, it is excellent and teaches people a lot about how to think about a problem. On the other hand, the author is so self-conceited that sometimes I asked myself: if he is so creative, why didn't he invent ANYTHING apart from his own way of making money?The funny thing is, that I still recommend this book!Peter Fabri, Budapest, Hungary"
2,Least creative book on creativity I've ever read.,"While I think De Bono had some great points, you could read the summary and the appendices at the end of the book, and have gotten most likely more information than reading the book, which was basically a 330 page advertisement for De Bono's consulting company. So, one star for tricking Harper Collins to publish the longest advertisement ever published, and one more star for successfully writing a book.Honestly, everything in this book steams from common sense. None of his techniques stem too far outside of putting two things together that don't belong. His made up word Po is interesting and intriguing, and probably the most you'll gain from reading 'Serious Creativity'. All Po is is a link to place two words together that would otherwise be out of context, ie 'Planes Po Landing upside down'.Is it worth reading the last 18 pages? Yes. Should you buy this book? No."
4,Great kids game!,"My 3 yr old loves this game even though he can't do most of the missions. It is challenging for my 7 yr old. I have even played it and enjoy it! If you love the movie, you'll love the game!"
4,hmmm..,"Well, im not usually a fan of dance music, or techno or whatever you call this, but ive been humming the tune to The Riddle for weeks! Its a really great tune, and so is the other stuff by Gigi D'Agostino."
5,Most useful Salad Book ever,"200 EASY, varied, tasty recipes with few ingredients and simple dressings. Arranged by month and availability of produce grown in monastery, this book is a gem and invites you to experiment with unusual pairings. Recipes from many other countries are included as well as the chef's own creations. For anyone trying to include more vegetables (and less meat) in your diet for health and weight reasons, this is the book for you. You can still go to the Greens or Chez Panisse cookbooks for other unique (and time-consuming) salads, but for daily use this is the best I've found in decades of being a total foodie who loves to cook and entertain."
1,So very disappointing!,"While the dressing recipes are abundant, varied, intriguing; the salad recipes themselves leave so much to be desired. I truly believe a five year old could concoct a more interesting and tasteful assemblage. Your average salad ingredient list rarely exceeds five items. Easy you say. Boring and tasteless I say. Unless of course you're just in it for the dressing. A salad is a blank canvas and the possibilities are endless. This cookbook ends the adventure before it begins. Save your money and search elsewhere."
5,Love this book!,Thanks for getting this book to me quickly and in perfect condition! What an excellent book - full of great salad ideas that don't have complex ingredients!
1,Skip this one...,"This wannabe Blair Witch video is mostly about a team of gay men who visit another gay man and a lesbian in a trailer park, who then recounts a haunting. I love gay people like any others, but the male characters are over the top effeminate and ruin the movie. This seemed much more like a community college drama club project than a straight (using the term lightly) to video movie. If you are looking for something in this genre, then obviously the Blair Witch is your first stop, then Paranormal Activity. After that, the quality of these films plummets from tolerable (The Fourth Kind) to unwatchable (lthis one)."
3,NOT BAD OR PRETTY GOOD,"This movie suprised me. I had watched the trailer first and groaned, ""another bad, bad movie."" It turns out the movie is not bad and there are some great extras. The image and sound is good. There is one caveat, make sure you get the copy that has ""2003 Version"" near the top of the title. Another bit of advice. This DVD is not worth the price Amazon is charging, unless you are a die-hard Mastorakis fan. You can pick this up at many other vendors for a third of the price. One of the extras on this disc and others in this ""collection"" is a great autobiograpy on the films of Nico Mastorakis. He seems like a fairly smart and decent person. It makes you want to buy the entire ""collection"", but like I stated not at the Amazon price."
3,The Continuing Adventures of the Vampire Radu,"This second installment in the Subspecies series is a much better story than the first. At least it has more originality. The premise is Michelle, the woman the brothers Stefan and Radu did battle over in the first movie, is desperately trying to enlist the aid of her sister to flee the monstrous Radu who considers her his ""fledgling"". She also is fighting to keep the bloodstone, a mysterious stone that bleeds the blood of the saints, which can allow a vampire to live without feeding on humans. Yes, the worn out dialog continues with this movie but the improved story line keeps the viewer hanging in there. At the end we see what appears to be the demise of Radu . . . but everybody knows vampires have a nasty habit of coming back for a sequel. It still has a comic-book quality to it but with a decent vampire tale to go with it. As with the first movie, ""Subspecies"" I'd recommend this for diehard fans only."
3,Interesting,An interesting movie about an interesting political topic. The American spin in Moscow. Good actors for a premium cable movie and a movie that doesnt drag on.
4,a must for political junkies,Since this is based on a true story it is a must have for political junkies in your DVD collection.
5,"100 days, 100 stars","With all due respect to others who write about WWII, it would be difficult to find anyone better.I would never have thought it possible to read a book that puts you ""there"" during the last 100 days.The Chicago Tribune says it very well ""Fascinating ... the narrative shifts from scene to intimate scene of every conference room... from liberated camp to Hitler's underground bunker... to GI's storming the railroad bridges across the Rhine... Toland has woven the tapestry of history.""If you read and enjoy WWII, this book is a MUST."
4,Wow! What a book!,"If you are a serious student of WW II, you have to read this book. John Toland's attention to detail and story telling are outstanding. He is a great writer. I really enjoyed reading this book. The pages turn very easy."
3,please notice,"With all the other glowing reviews obviously this is a fine book. I offer this review only to point out the publication date. I purchased the book erroneously thinking it was a new 2003 release only to find that the release was really in the 1960's. I fully admit that this was my own mistake.My disappointment is that, while Toland presents accurately, much new and enlightening information has come out since the 1960's. For those who are younger or who have not read much on WWII history the book will be very enjoyable."
2,"Squeak, squeak","This faucet has an elegant, classical look, but after a few months of use the hot water tap started squeaking when the handle is turned. This isn't quite annoying enough (yet) to motivate me to buy and install a new faucet, but it's a close call. Also, how much water you get doesn't directly correlate to how far the tap is turned. You can turn the tap about 30 degrees and get no water at all, and then have the volume go way up with a few degrees more. All in all the product has a cheap feel to it."
3,Good but not great,"Not all of the songs are easy to understand (for those that speak Amharic). Also, not all Ethiopian kids will know these songs. Additionally, at least one song (ABCD) segues into a religious song where the children sing about the evils of dancing. So while an Ethiopian kids in the US may hear it and be excited to hear something about his culture, there are other messages being delivered that may give you pause. Or not."
3,Good product wrong item,The skin would work well on the right iPOD. it protects in normal environments well. However I something for more hasrh climates. the belt clip for it is wonderful though.
2,Double holes were unexpected,These seem to be drilled for use in chandeliers. I had purchased them for another application and was unhappy to learn that they are drilled in two places which will not work for my application.
1,Don't waste your money,"Don't waste your money on this one. I have yet to find a solution to my vole/mole problem. I have tried this product, solar mole chasers, regular mole chasers, chewing gum, cat hair and etc. My next try is the vole/mole worm killer. I'm lookig for something to use in the winter because that is when I'm having the most problems and they are destroying my yard and eating the roots off my flowers."
2,Gopherzilla,"I bought three bags of this product and used it over a three month span. It works for a little while but I think perhaps our gophers are a bit more persistent than your average gophers. I gave it two stars only because it works for just a short period and then you need to reapply. Perhaps with fewer gophers it might keep them away, it just didn't work in our yard in the long term."
5,A window on the evolution of television.,Since I was born well after Jack Gould's retirement..it was exciting to feel the development and growing pains of the medium..through the columns Gould published. Lewis Gould's profile of the man and his life added to the sense of connection I felt to him..You feel television's evolution...as if you were there.Jennifer SalemAntioch California
3,Good but not best,Bejewelled I is a good game that I really enjoyed playing until I got Bejewelled II. It is the best. Both are highly addictive and fun.
3,Good book on police use of force-but read with care,"I read this book to stay current with what is being published about Police Use of Force.The author has for the most part done a good job but there are several over generlizations in his book. For example, he states that Tennessee v Garner establishes the standard for the use of deadly force by Police. However, Graham v Connor establishes the standard for the use of force, deadly or not, during an arrest, ""Terry"" stop or other seizure of a free citizen. Tennessee v Garner does establish when you can use deadly force on fleeing suspects in addition to when you could use deadly force under Graham v Connor.This book is again a good starting point for learning more about police use of force."
3,I was hoping for a different angle,"I must first admit I've only watched the first episode, but based on that, I'm a little disappointed. I was hoping for more details on events like when the power went out, and how different people reacted, then the water, etc... It also seems to by trying too hard to show drama between characters. I'll watch a few more and hope it gets better..."
2,Disappointing considering the pedigree...,"I'm a fan of Abrams on Alias (at least the first 3 seasons), Lost, Star Trek, etc. Love Kripke's early seasons of Supernatural. Enjoyed Favreau's takes on Iron Man. Given the big names involved I expected to like this but it is just so weak.Acting is sub-par, dialogue is terrible, characters are inconsistent and uninteresting.It feels like an old bad Saturday morning tv show."
2,Good premise but...,"I think the show has a good premise. A couple of the actors are good. However, the main character pretty much drives me nuts. And everyone is always way too pretty and handsome for the world they're living in! It really brings down my ability to suspend my disbelief! It needs to be more ""real."""
5,I love it.,One of the best writ shows of last year. A must see to believe. The sad thing this could happen.
2,Nothing special,"Too similar to all the other survival type of shows. Years ago I would've loved this show, but now that I've seen so many like it, I can predict the whole story line and get frequent deja vu. It's too boring for me. They need to quickly change the show to give it something unique."
2,Revolution,Not that impressed with Revolution. It has become way too predictable. The story line is interesting but it is starting to be just another Lost series. And since they are using some of the cast from that show I guess that is to be expected.
3,Interesting Concept Questionable Execution,"Yet another survival themed series. Instead of Dinos like in last year's Tera Nova or Zombies in the Walking Dead, this time the world has lost (or most of the world has lost) the ability to use anything powered by electricity. Great concept but the characters don't appear to be any worse for the wear. Militia/armed thugs are the antagonists more so than the environment. So far I can only base this review off of the first episode but the writers seem rushed. Little to no character development with a plot line thats seems hurried. It has potential but the writing has to slow down and dig deeper."
1,JJ Abrams and Jon Favreau should be embarrassed,JJ Abrams and Jon Favreau should be embarrassed. How do you take such an interesting idea/concept and butcher it so badly?
5,Sweet!,Been following from episode 1. Not a dull episode yet. Full of suspense and keeps your mind ticking about what's going to happen next! Great show!
4,It shows promise,"You can never be sure from the pilot how good a show will be, but this one definitely shows promise. Great premise...the power goes out all over the world. Hope the show lives up to the promise of the pilot"
5,This show is getting better and better,"Missed the airing but was able to hook up the phone to stream from AMAZON. Awesome, my wife is addicted and I too am getting that way. The show is evolving a bit, and I am really glad. Though the promotions for this episode were extremely misleading, the episode was a good one."
1,Didn't Get Past First Episode,"And, I can watch it ""free"" on cable. Really just unbelievable: Electricity, all kinds, go out world wide. I know in scifi you have to suspend some disbelief, but really how can this really happen-scientifically(even science fiction wise)????? Then when the electricity goes out, the whole government of the USA colapses, and the country divides up into smaller fifdomes. Do the writers realize that prior to the 1900s our government worked just fine for nearly 125 years without electricity!? Also, there where many functioning government in human history going all the way back to the egyptions? Not worth my time, and they'll probably cancel it without a resolution just like Terra Nova."
5,Original,"I like the plot. It may not be completely feasible, but sometimes originality makes up for impracticality. This show isn't a far stretch like Lost, where almost everything that happens defies nature and logic. It's a stretch, but I was able to go with it. The acting isn't incredible, but I've seen much worse. So far, so good- it's worth the watch!"
2,"Interesting concept, poor execution","While I love all things sci-fi, and post apocalyptic tales especially, I have to give up on this show. I could ignore the poor logic and the stock story, but I can't ignore bad characters and worse acting. The Katniss clone and her uncle are both wildly inconsistent in their actions, uninteresting and poorly acted. I just can't waste my time watching these two stumble through the script."
2,uninspired,"I read the poor reviews, and decided to watch anyway. Unfortunately, I have to agree with those that thought the premise, acting, and writing are poor quality. If the acting is good, you can overlook some plot issues. If the story is good, you can overlook some bad acting. In my opinion, the show didn't have anything to make it watchable. With this scenario, scientific principles that have presumably always existed, are somehow negated by something contained on a flash drive? I did notice that good hair care, and dentistry are still very much intact. I'd hate to see the ideas that were rejected to allow this pile a time slot."
2,Disappointing distopian soap opera,I was hoping that this would be a thought provoking scifi drama...but it was a predictable and poorly acted mess.There was nothing particularly endearing about any pf the characters and I ended up not caring what happens to them.I hope they all get blown away.
1,Bad,"Interesting concept of no electric, TERRIBLE TERRIBLE TERRIBLE acting. the lead actress is TERRIBLE. Unbelieveable story line.... the world has no electric and we are going to follow a teenager to find her brother? who cares!"
1,Revolution-chained Heat,Terrible service...constantly froze and we finally gave up. Would like our money back. Never finished it...couldn't finish it...unless you like still images...my imagination is not that good. Get it together Amazon!!!
5,Awesome Series!,A+ 100% very entertaning! I enjoy the look into this possible future. Cant wait for the next season to air!
3,Apocalypse Meehhhhh,"I love sci-fi and the apocalypse genre is my favorite. The sets are well done and there is some decent acting here, mainly Billy Burke and to a lesser degree, Giancarlo Esposito (who I would rate higher except so far he's playing the same part he had in Breaking Bad). The rest of the cast is meh.....especially Tracy Spiridakos who is unconvincing in her part and is no Katniss Everdeen. Overall, I rate this show as entertaining but one that could have been much, much more."
2,Tried to like it. But...,"I watched the first 3 episodes, hoping it would get better. It didn't. You would have to really be able to overlook the glaring lack of believability in order to enjoy this. Really, no one after the village goes looking for food, hunting, cooking eating, fishing? They run into Charlie's long lost uncle of 15 years in the town of Chicago, with the very first person they meet?I could go on and on. Suffice to say, if they don't completely redo this to add credability, I don't see how it could possible last another season."
5,Read World History,"Fascism & National Socialism (or Marxism) are alive and well in the hearts of many ignorant Americans. With a civil war brewing on the horizon, and the various oligarchies waiting for just such an opportunity, Americans need to decide what is more important, the ""Illusion of Security"" or the Unaliable Liberty on which this Great Country was founded. This fictional Tv program provides a sobering view of what things could happen if division contiues to grow in The USA. History does repeat itself!"
2,"Hot girl, but...",Just doesn't seem to be going anywhere.blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
1,Dumbest show premise ever,"I'm really surprised JJ Abrams had anything to do with this t*rd in the punch bowl. The premise alone is simply stupid. We have over 4k years of technologically advanced human civilization. Guess what our country and was built and thousands of years of civil advancements took place in Europe and the East without electricity. The notion that because the electricity went out our society suddenly breaks down, the US gov't gives up and our military forces seem to have all gone home is just too big of a shark to jump even for stupid television. NBC you suck."
3,Should be better than it is,"Based on the concept, this is a show that I really wanted to like, but it has not yet caught it's stride. For having grown up in a world without power, the Charlie character does not seem very believable --- too soft and emotional."
3,Entertaining,"I give this show a 3/5. It is entertaining, but other than that, it is shallow. This show has potential, but rather than try to employ blatantly implausible (impossible) physics, it would have been better to find some other reason for the global catastrophe and focus more on the struggles and survival of those remaining. This would allow for more in depth character development and deeper story line.Regardless, I still find it interesting and entertaining. A few of the actors do a good (not great) job, but i agree with other reviewers that they seem ""wooden"""
3,Suspend disbelief for suspending disbelief.,"There is no way they are going to be able to explain (write) their way out of this one short of some futurists alien technology because the fundamental concept doesn't make any sense what so ever. This show throws simple physics and common sense out the window. Like how is it a generator doesn't work? Or why couldn't cars work? None of the ""NO electricity"" makes much sense at all. I'm all about suspending disbelief for Sci-fi....but this one is a stretch when it completely defies all logic. Having said that the show in and of itself is pretty good....but really I'm only watching at this point to see how they explain their way out of the entire thing...if they even bother to try. I predict this will be on for 1 or 2 seasons and then cancelled."
4,Revolution rating,"I enjoyed every minute of it, however, some things just jumped out and grabbed you such as the clothing. They wore great clothing for an area that had been decimated of all machinery, Factories etc. 15+ years after lights out the Leather Jackets were like new???????. Regardless, I really like the series"
3,Waste of time,"I guess I was hoping for something a little more gritty and apocalyptic but this entire show seems to revolve around the schizophrenic whining of ""Charlie"" and apart from that never seems to actually go anywhere. Lost never really went anywhere either but at least you could trick yourself into believing it would, this is just a tired attempt by some studio to use an otherwise intriguing theme to make a PG feel good show for anyone from 5 to 90 years of age. Pass."
2,NEEDS A LIKEABLE MAIN CHARACTER,"Personally I have to say that I wanted to like this show. I found myself trying to make myself like this show. Could have been good but to be honest the main character sucks. You killed my father took my brother, oh my goodness who is that cute soldier boy over there. You are part of the unit that killed, and captured my family, but your so easy on the eyes it can't be true. For a series that could have been great, they killed it with the blah main character. So next time you put money into a series like this spare me the boy crazy teen who can't act. Watch Last resort if you want an action packed story with depth. If you want a twilight and hunger games ripoff watch this show."
2,"Fantastic concept, very poor execution of it","As a couple who is really into apocalyptic fiction, we were looking forward to checking this series out. We've watched three episodes now and it's painful to watch. It's like they pulled all the characters from the pages of an Abercrombie & Fitch catalog and it's so unbelievable when watching. Everyone looks like a model and the women are all hanging out. Everyone is way too clean for what they'd be in the situation they are in. On top of that, the acting isn't good."
2,Incredibly week start....,"I had such high hopes for this.Acting is sub-par, dialogue is terrible, characters are inconsistent and uninteresting.Has a soap opera feel to it."
1,Not Revolutionary,"This is a great idea for a show. Unfortunately, it is written in typical made-for-tv low quality fashion. It's like Walking Dead without the good directing, good acting, and good writing. It comes off very cheesy. Sappy music at the sappy moments. The lead character is not believable. In fact, she's not even watchable. Cringe-worthy. Do not invest. You will want the hour back."
3,"Slow start, better ending.",New writers/director must have been brought in for the last four episodes as it got stronger. The acting seemed a little weak but again got better.
2,Revolution,Ok. Not worth the money to buy each weeks broadcast. Have bought a few at 2.00 ea but do not expect to finish. Do not like the Amazon policy of buying ea weekly show.
3,It is probably headed for the dustbin,"I have watched them all and all I can say is they kept me just interested enough to do so until now. Before, I could find some amusing elements but now I can't get around Charlie's overwrought expressions that just don't come off as natural. As a key character, it is a shame she is the weakest link. Even the bespectacled millionaire tech guru is a more fleshy character and he is only a supporting role. (I keep wondering where he has been getting his glasses for 15 years!) I was actually afraid they were fixing to kill off another good one in this episode and was puzzled that it took 15 years to put a steam locomotive into play. I will say this though, they found the perfect kid to play young Jason. They could be brothers in real life. I will probably still watch the next episode, but I don't have any real expectations that it will improve."
2,Trying to be Lost meets Walking Dead?,"That's how it seemed to me but without the magic of Lost nor the zombies. I was not impressed. However, if this show came out in 1992 it might have pretty cool (I mean rad)."
2,One Dimensional,"Nice try, but no cigar. The characters and set-up are too stock in this story with an otherwise interesting premise."
1,Wwhat chance of this seeing another season?,"When really good shows like Terra Nova and Last Resort never see a 2nd season, what chance this sad series?"
4,Wonderfully entertaining,This show is worth checking out. It is exciting and thought provoking. Good character development. I really hope this show stays on the air for several seasons.
3,good show bad streaming,The Revolution series is a good new show however the streaming of it from Amazon was not up to par. The streaming paused several times for buffering and although I paid for HD the qualiy of the picture was definitly not HD.
3,"it's not Jericho, but it will do....","if you're addicted to doom and gloom end of the world shows, this will do for a fix, but it doesn't feel right. It seems a little propagandized and predictable. I almost feel like I'm watching a cheesy remake of Kevin Costner's ""POSTMAN"" mashed up with some good ole high school angst from ""RED DAWN."" Thank goodness the remake of RED DAWN is coming out soon, or I may die of withdrawals. I'll keep watching, just to see where it goes."
2,"Pastiche of other people's ideas, too much violence, hokey take on heroine","Review of the PILOT:I'll try another episode or two if they were free (I watch all TV and movies via streaming video, not cable), but I wouldn't waste money on subscribing to the series, judging by the pilot. They've ""borrowed"" so many ideas from at least four other series (Jericho, in particular) or movies that even I recognize right-off, and I'm not a FANatic who remembers all details. They should be paying royalties to them, but ideas can't be copyrighted, and they're just taking bits from each show. The premise is intriguing, so too bad if they're going to waste it. Some shows take a while to develop or get interesting, so I might try one more episode but spending more money on it isn't high on my Must Have list."
1,You Have To Be Brain Dead,"So all the power goes off for some mysterious reason...no problem so far. But, did every scientist and physicist die too? Sword fights...really! In every scene there are all these candles because well there is no electricity. So where do you get the hundreds of candles? You can't find gas, or guns or bullets but their seems to be an inexcusable supply of candles. No bullets but plenty of gunpowder for the flintlock rifles? I guess you go to the flint, ball and candle store for those things. Watching paint dry would be more entertaining. NBC is in last place for a good reason."
4,"Worn, but good","The premise is a bit weak -- but not unlike most Abrams shows akward to grasp at first and easier with suspension of disbelief. Characters are easy to like, or hate. Most of the plot twists are spotted a mile away, so far. But a fun show, nonetheless."
4,Hooked!,I have become hooked on this season. Catislistic and thought provoking of what life could become if we lost all power in our nation.
1,The Show is Awesome Amazon SUCKS!,The Show was Great However Amazon's Streaming of it was Un-watchable waste of my money had to get it else where. nbc.com plays all of revolution for free full episodes recommend you watch it there
3,"It has it's moments, needs a few more..","This episode was pretty much like the first. Kind of on the weak side and the characters continue to try to define themselves. Being the foundation of the story line, the voodoo science is not going anywhere, so like the first, I was amusingly entertained. You can make a single shot firearm out of that?!It did have a thought provoking scene that spoke to the love affair we have with our gadgets. It made it clear how we could end up empty handed and brokenhearted because they have taken the place of the more traditional means of keeping our personal history. Poignant, but also funny, after seeing this one, I feel the need to print up all of the pictures on my gadgets and send my mother a birthday card and I don't mean an E-card!I'll keep watching."
1,Sorta like 'Lost' but like season 3 of Lost. The one that sucked big time.,"The show is too unbelievable. Even with trying to suspend disbelief I was unable to get engrossed in this convoluted story. How is it, with so much time to tell a story on a television show, they can be so lazy as to completely disregard logic? At least TRY to get things to make a little sense. And the fact that the world is in this condition, but everyone has perfectly clean and pressed clothes bugs me too. If the story was good I could ignore these things, but since it isn't, I can not forgive this show for the crappiness it is. I watched the first four episodes, if it gets better please let me know and I'll give it a second chance."
1,How long?,"How long was this up before you started to charge for it? Generally, you let people know when a new series starts and usually for awhile the pilot is generally free, so how long was up before you started charging?"
2,Not a pleasure...,"The setting, time period, and Singer's life as a child of a Rabbi in Warsaw makes for an interesting topic, but young readers have difficuly making personal connections with hasidic Jewish cultures. I recommend this book for young adults interested in Yiddish literature. Support is needed for children that have little understanding of the religious customs and vocabulary."
3,Average,A comprehensive book. A nice book to have in my collection. This book needs more color pics. Difficult to Learn surgery with words and less pics.
2,Beats me,"I've been a fan of Carlinhos Brown since even before Alfagamabetizado-- still his masterpiece IMHO--and I guess I'd buy pretty much anything he writes, performs, or produces. Saw this double CD in Spain this summer but I figured it would be easy to get in the states so I passed. It wasn't. Finally tracked it down through Amazon, though I had to wait a while. It wasn't worth the wait, with a couple of exceptions. Most of this album is ""carnavalesque""--party beats, in other words, without much at all in the form of lyrical or musical depth. I guess the title ""Candyall Beat"" is truth in advertising. There are a couple of cool tracks though: Sambadream, Mariacaipirinha, and the remix of Bocarriba will get your Brazilian caipirinha party going wild. Other than that, this ""experiment,"" I'm sorry to say, is pretty much a flop."
4,If you got your mojo working for you...,The Blues harp songbook contains 21 songs by blues harp players ranging from Ollis Martin to Little Walter. It describes the basic grooves and solo`s of every song giving you just enough material to figure the rest out for yourself. It isn`t meant for people who don`t dig playing blues harp yet. For them I recommend books by David Barret. But if you`re into it you`ll surely like to learn some new styles. The book has most use if you also order the audio cassette.
3,"Good Thoughts, Muddled Presentation","Ortega y Gasset presents some interesting ideas; unfortunately his presentation of them is not particularly clear, nor does it build well from one thought to the next. The reason for this is that the contents of this book were not intended by him to be presented in written form, but rather to be left as he originally presented them, as a series of lectures. When reading the book, you can see the effects of the book's original form: rambling passages one would expect of a professor lecturing; asides that don't directly relate to the subject at hand; and a general lack of editing to make the points in the book clear.So, while this book contains some interesting ideas, when buying it, be aware that you will have to wade through a lot of irrelevant data to boil them down."
5,Deftly exploring the impracticalities and seemingly inane concepts which restrict our citizens and fill our penitentiaries,"Trapped: When Acting Ethically Is Against The Law by John Hasnas (Associate Professor, McDonough School of Business, Georgetown University, Washington DC) focuses upon ethical dilemmas arising from the over-criminalization of commonplace behaviors, demands of the law and ethics considerations for its violation, and the seemingly culturally sanctioned allowance of unethical behavior amongst corporate executives and businesses. Deftly exploring the impracticalities and seemingly inane concepts which restrict our citizens and fill our penitentiaries, Trapped is very strongly recommended reading for anyone with an interest in business ethics, white color crime, and their impact in a highly competitive marketplace."
4,Well done!,Beyond the obvious research the author has done on the subject; he has painted a picture of one of those men in history who lived a colorful life at possibly the wong time. In today's world Robert Vesco would probably be a hero.
2,Reads like a Federal indictment,"No doubt, lots of work went into this book. It is very detailed. Vesco led a secret life, so the first 75% of the book deals with the complicated web of financial transactions that lead up to the interesting stuff, stealing 225million dollars. Very hard to follow, I found myself skipping over pages over and over again just trying to get through some of the painfully boring, hard to follow parts. Not much on Vescos personal life, which is understandable. I am traveling around Latin America, spent months in Costa Rica. He is legend there among local people. Thought it would be a good beach read, was wrong. I apologize to the author because there was so much research done to write this. If you are a coke bottle reading glasses kind of dork, you might find the details somewhat interesting. If you do though, please consider killing yourself."
5,Great orgeat,"I recently purchased three orgeats available here on Amazon: Ferrara, Monin, and Teisseire. I tested each orgeat in a variety of cocktails, and Monin was the best choice in every test. It has a rich almond flavor that stands up well even when mixed with a number of ingredients in a cocktail, and gives drinks a smooth depth. Unlike Ferrara--which was my second choice--Monin's product has no preservatives and comes in a glass rather than plastic bottle, both plusses in my book. I highly recommend this orgeat."
5,The best Travel Journal,"My daughter received this as a gift a couple years ago as going away present on her first trip to Europe. She is now on her 2nd trip and I decided to pull her journal and buy a new one for this trip. Two of her friends were going to join her, so we started researching how to purchase another journal. Turns out that none of the travel journals we found compared to the manner in which this is designed/formated. The girls enjoyed reading the first one and were absolutely adamant about getting the same. After looking in stores, and online, I pulled the old journal, and googled it and found it at Amazon. The flexible cover, the size and the different sections allow for a traveler to carry it everywhere and quickly catalog information about places, restaurants, incidents, etc."
3,Interesting but not complete,As a babalawo I'm happy to have bought this book. There are lots of good things. It's interesting because it give a quick resume of each Odu in just one book. About 2 itan by odu (some have just one) and 4 for the meji. each time with the ebo.I just have would like that tones and specifics sounds would have been better written and specifiquely for the name of the awo.
1,"It's called ""Sacred"" for a reason",this book is such a sham. the actual oracle is only for Babalowo's and should not be read by everyone. If Niemark wasn't so concerned with making money under the guise of religion he would not have written this book. He should be banned from being a Babalowo. He should know better.
4,Great Reference,"Afolabi Epega did a great job in his explanation of the 256 Odus. The ""western"" observation and the introduction written by Philip Neimark could have been left out and the book would have been better off. It is a shame that Oluwo Afolabi Epega is even remotely affiliated with Philip Neimark in this book."
4,"Mappa Mundi, A Real Treasure","Simple enough to help a beginner, but with enough detail for a graduate student who needs an overview, this little gem is well written and filled with illustrations. P. D. A. Harvey does an excellent job of shortening and tightening his longer text to a version rich in detail. An interesting and fun read."
1,Bad choice!,I order this shoes!! thinking they where brown like show's in the picture!! but what was my surprise when i open the box! and found a BLACK shoe!!
2,Disappointing,"Looks nice, but suction was meager and the automatic retractable cable stopped retracting after a week so I sent it back for a refund. It did take a while to get it refunded by Tiger, unusually for them."
3,You get what you pay for.,"It doesn't do much, but since it only cost $30 with free shipping, I didn't expect much. It didn't clean anything but the very loosest and most recent dust off the carpet, but thus far (fingers crossed after reading past reviews) it IS extracting water pretty well. I'm still confused as to how they got away with putting the word ""Steamer"" in the product name. It most certainly does NOT steam. What it does do is take hot tap water and spray it on the carpet. It was a snap to put together since it only involved the handle and three screws, and the directions were fairly well written. The collection reservoir has a small, odd square opening in the back for pouring out the extracted water. It's in an awkward place on the back of the reservoir and has made a small mess each time I've emptied it.I think the best use might be to use this in place of a damp mop with a canned ""heavy traffic area"" product."
3,Hard to clean,"Altogether, a pretty good value for the money. My carpet seems clean. But I found the dirty water compartment to be very difficult to clean. One of my rugs is a pretty high shag area rug. The Cleaner picked up quite a bit of the fuzzy bits of shag. They were nearly impossible to get out of the dirty water compartment. I finally resorted to a long shish-kabab fork. The other components were also a bit hard to clean.Also I don't highly recommend the Bissell Stain and Pet cleaning product - think I will try something else next time."
5,Small means small,"While the 1960R QuickSteamer works well, it isn't powerful enough to lift tough stains, like the ones in my dining room. It took me many cycles to clean the stains, with over two hours of work. It cleans my living without any hassle, and took only SIX minutes. Warning: If you have a big house, i.e. over 2,000 sq ft., I suggest you buy something else from Bissell. It will take you hours to clean every inch of carpet. Since my house isn't big, the 1960R QuickSteamer is perfect. For the price, you can't beat it! I got free shipping ($16 total) and thus, it's even cheaper than a compact vacuum cleaner."
1,Remanufactured Bbissell,The Bissell I bought only turned on one time and then quit. I had to return. But Amazon was very gracious and paid for the return.
3,Good for only a few uses!,"I bought this because of all the other reviews. I have 2 dogs and one is a puppy being potty trained. I loved the price, the size, and weight. I received it and used if for the first time to do the whole livingroom it worked great but it was amazing for the price. The next time I used it, it was the same but after that it went down from there. Now it will hardly clean anything out of the carpet. I guess its cheaper than renting to get 2 to 2.5 uses out of it but don't buy it for the long haul."
3,pretty good,"Heck, for 60 bucks, if you have light, say once a month cleaning, this cant be beat. Its small and light weight, puts together EZ, and when I dumped my dirty water tank, well, it was dirty. But if you have deep old stains, it wont pull it out. Could be time for new carpet! Water tanks are small, 1/2 gal. But lasted longer than I thought. The brush will not rotate."
2,Not good on stairs,"Unfortunely there are no moving parts, so it does not scrub the carpet, YOU do. Then, the suction is very low, so it only takes up the surface,and does not get the edges of the stair. It needs a full covering attanchment with moving brushes to do stairs, which is the area that gets the most dirt! Also, it takes up surface dirt, but not dirt in the carpet, so leaves large rings where dirt had been. Not useful."
5,Amazing Performance for this Price!,"I love this QuickSteamer by Bissell!We have very light carpet and live in ""the high desert"" which means a LOT of dirt gets tracked in every day.This cleaner is light weight enough that anyone can use it - yes, even if you have a back injury!Great suction - carpets dry quickly and it's amazing just how clean they get with very little effort.I'm really glad that I took the chance on this!"
5,Bissell lightweight deep carpet cleaner,"Small water storage space, but lightweight, easy to push, and really gets out the dirt. I love it!"
2,"OK for the price, don't expect it to last","I owned this for 2 years. It was average quality while it worked, but over time the bottom portion that holds the water after its picked up loosened and the tighteners would not fasten securely. Now I can spray the solution down, but it will not pick it up and hold it. If you want something to hold you over until you can afford something better it's a fine choice. It was still cheaper than the one occasion I had someone come in and do this job for me so it paid for itself."
3,"cheap, doesn't do a whole lot","got this hoping it would really clean the carpet, but it is clear it doesn't do much. we need to have a professional to come and take care of the really hard stains. it does come back with some pretty dirty water so I know it picking up something. no problem buying remanufactured. fast shipping as always. if had to do it over, would skip this product."
2,useless,tried to get a stain up with it. wound up getting out my Hoover carpet cleaning spray and getting down on my hands and knees like normal. Then it came right up.
3,broke,I recieved my bissell and was very excited it was easy to put together and use. But after about half an hour of use it broke it started steaming and made a terrible noise. I did call bissell and they are replacing it. They did not even hesitate in replacing it when I told them what was wrong they were very nice. The product was doing a great job for the time it worked and even though it borke I am not to upset because they are not ripping me off and are sending me a new steam cleaner.The only reason I gave them 3 stars is because it did break but everything else was fine.
2,Terrible!,"I bought this because the ratings were quite good considering the price. First of all ... if you are looking for something that will help remove spots .. consider something else!!!! I went over and over and over spots, and they still remain. I realize that this is not a ""spot bot"", although a steam cleaner should definitely take care of the problem -- especially onne with rotating brushes. Secondly, the tank is extremely small. It is about 1/4 of the size of cleaners that you rent from the store. I thought that I wouldn't be too upset if it didn't work as expected, although now that I have it, I definitely am! I would not recommend buying it for even $10.00 (which is $9.99 too much)!"
1,Medicore Performance with a Design Flop,"I bought this unit. It has a medicore performance. However there's a design flop with the unit (wonder why Bissell sells a lot of remanufactured?). The clean water unit will tilt toward you when you engage the paddle to start the vacumming (the clean water unit is attached on the handle of the vacuum so when you engage the unit to start to vacuum, the handle will not stand 90 degree anymore and so does the clean water unit). When the clean water unit tilt toward you, the unit will not spray the cleaning solution. This is easily to fix such by putting the velcro/wire so the clean water unit will not tilt toward you when you engage the paddle to start vacuuming. But I am surprised a big company such as Bissell will create such a design flop. I have not decided whether I am going to keep this machine or not due to the design flop.If they remanufacture these, they should have put the solution to their design flop unless they just too shy to admitt it."
3,works well I love it,"This thing works great. I got pretty discouraged when I started to read about all the things that you can be wrong with a refurbished product. It works better than I expected for the price, however, I'm not sure if this was problem before I bought it and thats why it was sent back but the foot pedal that retracts the appliance broke completely off the second time I used it. But I did have on some heavy shoes when I was using it. Anyway, It works great easy to use, very lightweight (eeven lighter than my vacuum cleaner). Plus it had a warranty cant beat that. I would definitely recommend this product. And about refurbished products, if you don't mind a lil cosmetic blemishes or kinks that can be worked out, go for it its usually still worth the bargain. When I first started looking for a carpet cleaner, they were at least $30 to $50 more than what I paid for this one."
4,great for the value,this product is a nice carpet cleaner for the value. it does not have a rotating head which you find in more expensive cleaners but i do find that it still works great. i was actually surprized to see just how well it did work.
4,Not bad for the price,"You can't beat this cleaner for the price. Its light weight, easy to use and its made pretty well. My only complaint is that there aren't any moving brushes which would probably make it do an even better job on the rugs. Other then that its worth the money."
1,Dansk Karen a Disaster,"I have owned Dansk Karen glassware for years. They were originally made in France and currently are produced in China. I just got the Karen Campaign flutes. While they are not as refined as past Karen pieces, the major offense is that, filled, they thud when tapped to toast. Unbelievable! There is no magic or beauty in THUD and Dansk does not seem to care as they will only note the complaint. That they would tolerate a product of this non-quality speaks volumes and tells me all I need to know about Dansk and their products today."
1,confessions of a ghost hunter,"I cant beleive how bad this book is, The first half is about him not ghosthunting. There are so many great ghost hunters out there troy taylor is a joke. want a good book read Hans Hozler you'll be hooked."
1,Massive Failure,"I read this book expecting to come away with some golden nuggets, especially since I am a recruiter for hedge funds. Instead, I found that the disparity is enormous between what really is required to land a hedge fund job and what Vault recommneds as the suggested approach. In my experience, following Vault's advice is contrary to what even commons ense would dictate is the correct approach to pursue. Separately, most of the topic covered in the book are superficial at best. A real disappointment."
3,beginners only,buy these only if you're new to the sport and not sure you'll stick with it. and don't pay a lot for them. they aren't very comfortable and the grip isn't great. i bought them for very cheap and wasn't sure I'd stick with the sport so it was worth it. bought a different pair after i used these for a few months and the difference in the shoes was immense.
5,It's the singing,"I've come to expect the musicianship to be top notch from the Gourds and ""Noble Creatures"" lives up big time. But it is the singing and flawless production that puts this outing over the top. Never have they sounded so strong and confident. This is one of those CD's that just gets better with every listen."
1,Boo!,"Not worth it. I was expecting a book about Systems Analysis from a unique perspective. This is really just a rambling collection of 'no-duh' concepts mixed in with poorly developed eastern philosophic analogies. It doesn't work and earns a ""boo."""
4,"Richard Harvey ""Blackjack the Smart Way""","Loved the book ""Blackjack the Smart Way"" and the audio book ""Preparing you to WIN"". It's the best book I've read on preparing you to play blackjack. Other books I've read were either too complicated or too short on material. These books cover all the bases including many aspects of the game I wasn't aware of. Mr. Harvey uses math to explain and back up his strategies, but it's presented in a way that makes total sense right away. Once I forgot to take the time to review my notes from the book before going to play, so I really enjoyed the audio book which got me in a winning frame of mind - and I did win!"
2,Flawed betting strategy,"I tried this betting strategy on computer simulated programs and the end result is always the same....my bankroll begins to slip. Even using quit points and starting again it continues to bleed money. Very disappointing, as I had hoped I had found the answer to blackjack. I guess life is hard, the casinos are not there to give you thier money. Playing a game where the percentages are against you is a sucker game, thats playing with someones rules tilted for them and against you. No doubt there will be people screaming at me for this review but before you do so try this yourself: Go out and buy 4 or 6 decks of cards and shuffle up to make your own shoe and start dealing to yourself and see how you do using his betting progression. If it works, god bless. I am going to try with real cards myself. Maybe the shockwave blackjack I was using does not represent a real deck."
3,Should be called Best of 80's Metal: The Ballads,"With the exception of ""Rainbow in the Dark"" and ""Seventeen"" these are generally ballads. There's nothing wrong with that if you like them. But I think this CD should be called what it is.On the other hand, that doesn't mean it's a bad CD. Most of the tracks on here are good. I'm not really into ""Kiss Me Deadly"" ""New Thing"" or ""The Ballad of Jayne."" But that's only an opinion.Overall, this is a good compilation if you mostly want to hear the softer side of 80's metal. I think it's a good CD to buy if you find it used."
4,Contrary to other reviews.........,"This cd is bangin' from top to bottom. If you know and appreciate the whole of hip-hop (ol' school as well as new), then you will get the full enjoyment of this disk."
3,This CD has one song that ROCKS!!!!!,"La Di Da Di is the only song worth spending $2 on. Save our money, people!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Impressive,"This book did the trick for me. I've used Opera for about 2 years - ever since 4 came out. The book is easy to read, and there are at least 3 chapters dedicated to customizing Opera. The samples on the CD are great for customizing e-mail and the instant messenger. Well worth it."
2,Dud,"This book is pretty much a dud. There seems to be very little here that can't be found in some form on Opera's web site. I think its overpriced by 60%. Opera itself is definitely a browser worth looking into, but this book was a waste of my money."
5,Raising the Dead: Profound Yet Readable,"Raising the Dead is a book I could not put down. During my second reading I began a list of favorite poems. However, I soon abandoned the idea because the list took on the appearance of the table of contents.The underlying theme of the work is loss. Overlaid on that theme Ron Rash has wrapped astounding imagery in Appalachian family stories and folk tales to create a masterful protest of the Jocassee Reservoir.Book arrangement is superb. Poems provide a series of knockout punches with very little breathing room between them.Despite his daily academic environment, Rash has avoided the temptation to bury his stories and images in literary language. His ability to produce profound poetry in everyday words is reminiscent of Billy Collins.This outstanding book must be included in the library of any poet or lover of poetry."
2,Great show - poor packaging,"The show is a classic. Everything everyone else has written is spot on. Unfortunately, this three disc set only contains 11 episodes. The British version has all 28 plus the x-mas specials. If you have a multi-region dvd, don't waste your money on this."
4,Never take the Phantom serious again...,Frank Spencer is part of British Culture. No comedian in the 80s or 90s could go long without a reference to him... mmm.. Betty...Anyway Crawford got typecast from it and so he prevented significant distribution of these shows here so that people would know him as the Phantom. Which is a pity as they are so much better than some of the shows that did make it here.But finally some of the best are available. Slapstick humour that is almost perfect.I'll take one star off as the transfer quality is not that good and no extras but still.....(Secret note to watch out for. Whenever he is doing a 'dangerous' stunt himself he has black leather gloves on. If they are missing its a double or not dangerous at all. Just watch how few of those there are. He did 95% of the stunts himself.)

3,Hard core and hard to follow,"Amy Bento is hard-core. All her workouts are probably not for beginners. I love cardio-kickboxing, but this one is a bit too complicated in the combinations (and this is coming from a Step instructor!). I don't feel like she focuses on form enough, either, so I worry about people injuring themselves without proper form and trying to follow tricky steps. If you like Amy, try her Boot Camp DVD...it's a real butt-kicker too, but easier to follow."
2,Amy Bento Kickboxing,"i was expecting much more with this video. it was very tough to keep up with her and she does the moves first and then tells you waht's next. for taking kickboxing for about 6 years, this is not what i thought."
1,Soccer Mom Workout,"Its not that this is a bad workout; it just wasn't for me. This is an aerobic choreographed workout with some kicks and punches, not a kickboxing workout. I don't to do grapevines and bouncy steps. That's so 80's. I was looking to kickbox. Right from the start the video irritated me. All the girls wear matching workout wear have smiles pasted on their faces and the heaviest girl of the bunch is the one who will be doing the ""modified"" version. It felt like high school. And I hate the barn doors in the background. I want to do a workout that a guy would come to, not a soccer mom routine that looks like it was filmed in a strip mall."
4,Bento delivers on her promise...in more ways than one,"I was warned by previous reviews of this product that ""Xtreme"" was demonstrated not only in the intensity of this workout, but also in complexity. My review is no different. Yes, Bento ramps up the cardio training with high-energy combos and intervals. This is definitely an endurance challenge. HOWEVER, at the same time, Bento's combinations have no sense of progression. Instead, they basically go from complex to even more complex. It can be a little frustrating at first, especially for beginners. But, I am sure that doing this workout repeatedly will make things easier. Even advanced kickboxing lovers (e.g. those who have done workouts like Billy Blanks many times) will have trouble. Regardless of her fast pace, I recommend this video because of Bento's intense, non-stop cardio drills. Just, be patient with yourself!"
4,Tough workout!!!,I am an advanced exerciser and Xtreme Kickboxing really made me sweat! The choreography is hard at first but once you get the hang of it its pretty fun! The only thing I didn't like about the workout was all the jumping jacks Amy does in the video (they really hurt my knees) but I just modify this and run in place or jump rope.
4,A different Deathlands,"This volume is a little different from preceding books. With two scenarios, it almost seems a little rushed. However, the story is as good as others and the action is fast. Just a little off the pace of the usual Deathlands volumes, therefore only four stars."
4,good paced action; good survivalism,a slight variation on the usual flow of the plot. The group has two main encounters this time around and an interesting challange. Quite enjoyable!
5,Blackberry Syrup,"This is such a fine syrup! No corn syrup, and you can tell! For anyone that has corn syrupsensitivities or allergies these Monin Syrups are perfect with Pancakes and waffles. Thisseller was also super fast shipping."
5,Beautiful Swiss Watch,I cannot recommend Invicta enough. They are among the best value to style going. The boxes are classy and everyone I have ever given one too has been delighted. I own 3
4,Good watch from a good company,"I have worn the Invicta #8935 daily for about 2 years and find it to be an exceptional watch - as long as I remember to wind it. The second sweep movement clearly states that this is not a quartz electric automatic. The gold clading has remained undisturbed over the 2 years under daily wear. The watch is heavy and rugged and does everything I need - and yes, the bezel can get stiff, but that can be addressed with silicone grease - just as the accuracy can be adjusted by a jeweler. Note the hour hand bulb not present in other models. At a glance, this looks very much like the very expensive other Swiss manufacturer's submariner. A remarkable watch at a remarkable price."
2,Craklins,I order these cracklins and when I got them I was happy until I open a bag and bite into one they were so salty I couldn't even eat them and it wasn't just the one bag every bag was the same I feel as tho I wasted my money and I spent $60.

4,Woody meets Hitch,"If Woody Allen had made ""Rear Window"", this would have been the result. The formula and structure is strikingly similar: Allen and Keaton star as a couple who have come to something of a stalemate in their marriage. She is adventurous; he, a neurotic (unsurprisingly), is patently not. When she becomes convinced that a neighbour is responsible for the death of his wife (""Who?"" asks Woody, ""You mean our next-door widower?""), she sets off on a daring Hitchcockian quest to uncover the truth, ending in the solution of a puzzling mystery that brings the two opposites back together.For wit and brilliance, Woody Allen is on top form. This is laugh-a-minute stuff. Along with Deconstructing Harry, this may well be one of Allen's best films of the '90s."
5,Like the good old murder mystery days,"Great movie. Made like the good oldies. A real plot, action, and suspense, without having to fill in with special effects. One you can watch over and over without tiring. Allen, Alda, Keaton and Houson at their best. They should have done more together. Also recommend Allen's newest movie, ""Small Time Crooks"". Keep them coming, Woody !!"
3,TOP FIVE OF MY FAVORITE ALLEN MOVIES,"great movie if you love woody allen movies, this one is in the top five for me, along with ""HANNA AND HER SISTERS, ANNIE HALL,MIRANDA MIRANDA, . ALAN ALDA is great in this movie. buy this movie you wont be dissappointed."
1,Dreadful,"Woody Allen performs an dreadful impersonation of early Woody Allen, complete with endless literal hand-wringing. Kept watching as I thought it would improve but it did not. In my opinion, had this been Woody Allen's first movie, it would have also been his last."
1,Wasted Effort,"Everything about this film says laziness: an inane script, laissez-faire direction, ad-libbed dialogue. Woody apparently thinks anything that comes out of his mouth is funny, and whereas that may once have been true, here most of his lines are trivial palaver. By the end of the film you're even sick of the soundtrack, an incongruent jazz standard played ad nauseum.This is chasms away from Allen's best work. Don't waste your time."
4,AN ENTERTAINING MURDER COMEDY,"I was highly entertained by this little ""murder comedy"" set in the Big Apple. The spontaneous acting style is refreshing and I enjoyed every performance: Allen fun as his neurotic self who slowly begins to believe what his wife Keaton and her friend Alda suspected all along: that their neighbor bumped - off his wife (suspicions arose when the neighbor showed no remorse or ""mourning"" after her ""death"".) Diane Keaton is absolutely astonishing in the fun-loving naturalness of her playing and Anjelica Huston was terrific in her role as the wise gal who sizes the case up in a nutshell."
3,Not the best Allen but well worth an evening at home,"Typical dry, neurotic Woody Allen humor mixed with a convoluted but quite original thriller plot. keaton is the real protagonist here, a woman who is so bored with her own life that she must involve herself in the lives of others.In the course of the movie we get a glimpse of Mahnattan life, of the multicultural melting pot rife with creativity, wealth, and crime. Keaton and Allen are a fairly typical middle aged couple, from New York or from any place really, whose life together is not enough to fill the day (or the night as you will find out in this film) but whose mutual bond is still strong despite the occasional jealousy."
2,Don't waste your time,"The plot of this 1993 film is pretty interesting but the characters are so annoying it is almost painful to sit through. I thought that this would be a suspenseful comedy and it wasn't funny at all (the comedy is really just the same cliche paranoid Allen character). Also, the movie was presented in 4:3 aspect ratio which is really annoying on a widescreen tv (come on, Amazon, you can do better). Even the music score seems like it was just a rehashed old score. Even if you like the actors or the director, there are far better movie choices, so don't waste your time."
2,The Unfunny Woody Allen,"This is a truly pathetic excuse for a movie. The dialogue is rambling and often incoherent (Keaton looks high much of the time and moves a hand constantly toward her nose), the story is confusing and unconvincing (and has to be explained, twice), the camera work is labored, and the artisie illusions and music are oh, so obviously ""in"". Worst of all, the film isn't funny. It should be no surprise that Woody Allen soon moved into a much darker genre of film making to occupy his later years."
1,Disappointed,"Honestly, I was excited to purchase/receive/view...just wasn't fast paced enough to keep my attention. I think you would have to definitely be a Woody Allen fan to get the most out of this. Just wasn't my cup of tea."
1,"Ugh! (can we go to Elaine now??, a table awaits...)","The cinematic equivalent of FLAT champagne.Tiresome rather than funny or mysterious. And unusual for Allen films, the photography is undistinguished. Ms. Keaton is lit to resemble a leper.The beginning of THE END for Woody, creatively. At least Crimes and Misdemeanors (which I loathed) had a germ of an idea behind it, stale as it was. MMM was the first real indication that the well had run dry; Allen's uninterrupted string of awful recent films only confirms this. Failing miserably even as a pastiche, MMM apparently doesn't seem like such an insult to younger, immature viewers who've never seen the Welles and Hitchcock films that Woody deigns to pilfer.I enjoyed Anjelica Huston --she gets to show some SASS --and she was all I enjoyed in this thin visit to the glue factory.Is Woody's latter-day post-Mia career ""the horror, the horror"" that Colonel Kurtz was talking about?"
1,Trite and unfunny...if that is you you will ove this film,This is just [bad] and lazy. The work of a once (and probably still) talented man who decided to absent himself from his home and his work...He deserved to have a break but didn't need to pin us down with the dumb reslult.Still...if you can enjoy...race off to Elaines after and have fun! or six or seven martinis.
4,So Delicious,"I love these bars! It is a wonderful meal replacement option. I had one last night for dinner while I was on the go and it was great. Plus, they are really good for you. The 11 grams of fat is GOOD fat that your body needs. Give them a try."
3,Joan Severance in noir type thriller,"It's Joan Severance. Yeah, she's blonde in this one, but it's still Joan Severance. Black Scorpion. Need I say more? Three stars for the appearance by Joan Severance."
3,"average film, but a real treat for severance fans","The plot of this movie is pretty lame and standard. It's not a ba movie though. The only bad part is the end,it really sucked but pretty much the only way the movie could end. One warning though, if you are looking for a happy ending where the guy walks away with the dough and the girl, you won't find it here. Other than that this movie is o.k, though slow. And severance turned out to be a better actress than I thought."
4,Dangerous Indiscretion is thrilling & short,"I am reviewing Joan Severance's ""Dangerous Indiscretion,"" also featuring devious Malcolm McDowell and C. Thomas Howell. A free spirit creative ad man, Howell sees Severance and after the predictable chase they couple. Severance's powerful hubby, evil McDowell finds evidence of the liasion & seeks to destroy Howell, beating Severance in the process. McDowell is ruthless. At same time he is trying to get zoning approval for a lakeside complex. There are lots of ruthless scenes along with some moments of tender love. Not typical sexploitation. Engaging plot, moves along, a few touching moments. 81 minutes. This is an enjoyable above average film that keeps flowing. Severance's acting rivals her beauty. This is the VHS ""Dangerous Indiscretion."" Clever uses of photo tampering shown. Howell's support lady is a doll. I highly recommend this film. Short, moving, engaging thriller.Dr. Alan Kardoff, Mgmtdr"
2,Unfocused,A friend gave me this cd. He didn't like it and thought I would because I listen to stuff like the Black Crows etc. The cd on a whole is unfocused. It's like Earl can't decide who they want to be. The first few songs are pretty good but then it goes into generic/uninspired rock mode. Nothing groundbreaking but it's okay background music. Nothing I'd pay for.
3,Easy reading,I found this book to be easy reading and enjoyable even though the language and settings were of the early 1900s. Exellent character development and exciting situations.
4,An analysis of American Presidential election politics,"McCormick does more than present a history of U.S. Presidential elections; rather, he analyzes the varying ""rules"" which defined what he terms the ""Presidential Game"" over the first century.He argues that the development of political parties, though not specified in the Consitution, became a necessary result of the ""game"" which developed.An interesting, although sometimes repetitive, text."
4,Great Book,Certainly a great book. Well designed. I am a hobby painter. Self taught and this book has certainly inspired me into painting some of the pictures in the book. If you love nature and painting this is simple step by step book has a wealth of information. Would certainly recommend it.
1,Shame on the KID who put this one together,"This is one BAD example of the music of this decade. First, the 60s started on JAN.one but I guess that dosen't count!If your looking to get a handle on where R+R (all) comes from this turkey an't it."
4,Gonna take a sentimental journey...,"I've had a soft spot for this odd duck of a movie ever since I saw it on the big screen. Last night I watched it on DVD. It starts slow, but after the first 30 minutes just about every scene sucks you in deeper in caring about the characters. Four spirits who died together are stuck acting as unofficial guardian angels for the kid who was being born at the time of their crash. They don't know why for 30 years, and when they find out, the film really takes off. Part ""Ghost"" and part ""Heaven Can Wait"" and a hint of ""The Bishop's Wife"" can be discovered here, but if your eyes are dry by the time it ends, then your heart is the hardness of a diamond but with none of the gem's sparkle. Downey is great, as is Charles Grodin, and everyone else in the cast is fine as well."
5,LOL!,"This movie has it all! Laughed, cried and certainly recommend to anyone who has a heart and soul.Truly entertaining"
4,cute idea,This was my daughters favorite movie to watch at her grandmothers house. She watched it a hundred times or more. She is 25 now and wanted a copy for herself
4,But it works!,"There is nothing in this movie that should be more than ordinary. It's sentimental. It's a tug on every heart string that's been tugged too often before. But it works. It works because of the grace and gracelessness of Robert Downey, Jr. in the lead role and because of his interaction with the ghosts who guide him to his enlightenment. Alfre Woodard (especially), Charles Grodin, Tom Sizemore and Kyra Sedgewick give Downey the life lessons he needs and find their own release. It's a sweet and lovely movie."
5,Old memories.,I grew up in the 80's-90's and this was a movie from my childhood. It was just as I rememebred. Terrific. It's romantic and funny.
3,Only if you really like Robert,The love story between Downey and Shue is never beleivable which hurts the core of the movie. Everyone else is great and Downey is excellent in his physical comedy when the others take over his body. But the movie doesn't quite cut it.
5,Heart and Souls DVD,"I purchased the DVD ""Heart and Souls"" from Amazon.Com. I looked for this movie everywhere and could not find it. Sure enough Amazon had it !!!! Ordering was easy and delivery was fast.Thank you Amazon !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Well worth buying,"An excellent fantastic comedy with never a dull moment and little known in Europe ( in France at least ). The music is beautiful and the sound quality of the DVD superb. Picture quality is good but film is in widescreen so doesn't fill your whole tv screen. One would have wanted more different language tracks and subtitles than those provided but I suspect the film is destined for an American and not European audience. Anyway, I loved it and could watch it again and again. Resembles in some ways ""Ghost Dad"" and Heaven Can Wait - Version 2 ( W Beatty )"
4,Cute movie,Wife loves it and wanted our own copy.Good and interesting story especially for Robery Downey fans.Would recommend and wife would highly recommend.
5,Loved this movie.,I loved this movie the first time I saw it. Now I can watch it anytime I like. Plus I love the music as well.
4,Chick flick,It is an ok movie for me. My wife and my sister in law loved it. So i figure it must be a chick flick...
4,A favourite,"I didn't like this at first, so corny, so trite. But my wife loves it and we have sat and watched it a few times. Well I have seen it a few times, I tried to avoid it. But against my better judgement I came to enjoy it. Downey Jr is as always a treat to watch. The cast are great. And yes it's such emotional puppet-work, you can almost see the strings being pulled as each setting is put together, Like a lot of movies you watch them go through the steps. 1/ When the dog or horse or cat or whatever is in danger of dying. 2/ The two lovers keeping missing each other by minutes as they trace their steps. etc. But I'm a cynic."
5,Great movie!,"This is one of the most heartwarming yet funny movies to this date, in my opinion.I have seen this movie in the past and loved it. Two of my favorite stars Tom Sizemore and Robert Downey Jr. star in it and also one of my favorite actress's in Alfre Woodard.I would recommend this movie to anyone and everyone.Thanks!!"
4,Perfect But Do Not Put Glass in Dishwasher,"I have been terribly pleased with this Boston Shaker. I have three (Persian, Boston, two-piece with built in strainer) shakers and this is my go-to shaker when shaking cocktails. Once you get comfortable setting and unsetting the two pieces together it is a pleasure to use. One warning: the handy (never tested for accuracy) gradations on the glass were washed off when I put it in the dishwasher. I rarely dishwash my barware, but did so with this. The Cascade Complete enzymes or something erased all trace of the markings on the glass. I probably wouldn't have used them too much anyway, but if you plan to use them, handwash only.Cheers!"
1,Don't waste your money,"Don't waste your money. Get a cheap Boston shaker and use a pint glass like the bars do. The Rosle glass broke and the metal bent without much force. I've used Boston shakers for years and have always tapped the metal against the bar or counter top to release the glass from the metal, without deforming the metal or breaking the glass. This is pure junk. May 14 update: The set was ""Made in China""."
3,Hard to read,"I am a bit disappointed in this writers ability to weave the facts into an interesting story, I find it hard to care much about what is going on. Plus his insistence on using the french word without an explanation of its meaning is distracting. I have no doubt that the story of the Legion is a fascinating one something this book is unable to show."
5,Old Henry,I thought that this book was really good. I think that it will help kids understand how you should never judge people because that is what they did in the book. The neighbors judge Henry because he moved into a house and he did not fix it up so his neighbors cleaned his yard for him and was running him out. The neighbors did what they wanted but when he left the neighbors started to miss him. It shows that with him gone there was something special the people liked about him.
2,Go for cotton...,"The fit of the boxers is great, as Calvin Klein usually does with all their underwear, but the fabric is terrible. When you use them for any sport activity you sweat twice as you would do with any other pair. Make yourself (and your skin) a favour and buy some CK Fine Rib Cotton ones. You'll thank for that."
1,**Warning**,My daughter got an iPod last Christmas and a few days later got an iSkin to 'protect' it. This Christmas I had to bring the iPod in to Apple because it had the sad iPod icon and it wasn't being recognized by our computer -we couldn't even charge it. The first thing the guy at Apple ask was if we used an iSkin cover. He said using the clip on the back will dent the back of an iPod over a period of time and the hard drive is right under were it dents. Of course it happened just after our 1 year warranty was up. Our next iPod will definietly have a different case!
1,when you apply pressure to the clip it dents your ipod back,when the ipod and hte iskinevo2 is in my pocket and a small amount of presure was applied the extremities if the clip caused a great amount of pressure and made two large dents into the ipod. i was soooooo mad.. i burned it!!!!! i called the iskin company and we are in communication and are aware of this issue. there should be something to protect it and its too hard.. The case is very bulky and attract alot of lint..terrible. If you have any questions email me at alejode@bellsouth.net
4,Good for starters,"Coteries is a good book in general, but not for every Vampire gamer. It contains a lot of considerations on how and why a group of characters band together, be them from the same clan, covenant or mixed backgrounds.As a consequence, the book is even more useful for those Storytellers who don't want to spend a lot of money with all 5 Covenant books just to better portray them in a few stories that won't have any of them as a central piece of the plot. It expands on each Covenant writeup mentioned in the core book.If you're that kind of player that thinks a roleplaying book should have lots of ""kewl powerz"" for you to use right away, this is not the book for you. But if you like to portray your character with style, this is a nice enough place to start."
2,Not what I excpected,"This was rushed work, instead of fully developing each coterie and giving it it's own book white wolf decided to slap together a bunch of crap and stick it together in it's never ending quest for cash instead of going for a good story. I love the circle of the crone and they didn't even bother to put level 4 or 5 rituals in it. They did however find room to put them in other books not even related to the circle. White wolf is simply doing what they always do, spreading there information over multiple books so you have to spend a bunch to know a decent amount about anything."
5,Join a local chapter of BNI today to conceive a larger dream team,"If ever there was anyone who understands the power of conceiving in what he calls ""positive and supportive"" ways, it's Ivan Misner. I've been a member of the company he founded, Business Network International, for years now. Every single year I have conceived with other positive people and found my referral network growing. Ivan helped refer me to my publisher and he and Beth are now friends of mine. Join a local chapter of BNI today to conceive a larger dream team of positive people than you ever imagined. No local chapter? Email Ivan and start one today."
3,Much to Gain,"Self-assessments and tips lists are quick to assimilate and useful. However, articles by business gurus and philosophers such as John Naisbitt and Deepok Chopra provide ample inspiration."
2,More like 2.5 Stars,"I was a little surprised that most of the chapters were about how successful networking has been for people. I already agreed that networking would be helpful, so why try to convince me? The essays were helpful to illustrate some points, but the book could have been more concise. After a while the essays became annoying as you could have substituted any name and any profession. And, if there was one more reference to BNI, I would have...I was about to give up on this book until I got to Chapter 9. There were some very helpful tips that pointed out what I was doing wrong and where I needed to improve. But as with anything, networking takes practice. I would check this out from the library before buying."
5,Networking Education in a Practical Way,"This book is a tremendous resource for any individual or company seeking to add the proven power of Word-of-Mouth Marketing to their business. The format of short essays from experts around the world is a refreshing change and will help those of us with shorter attention spans.Most powerful, however, is the information provided by the BNI Directors. These people are in the trenches of networking, day after day, and offer you a perspective that the big names cannot. They live networking and you should pay special attention to their insights. After all, when was the last time you received networking training from an individual that does it for a living?Purchase the book and live Givers Gain!Mike Garrison"
2,A collection of short articles,"This book is simply a collection of short articles. Rather than a detailed plan on how to become a master of networking, it gives many short viewpoints on a wide variety of subjects related to networking.The flow was not smooth and therefore the book didn't hold my interest very well."
5,Magic on video.,"After seeing Big Time on TV in 1989, I called up a friend and drove 400kms from our small town in North Western Ontario to buy the albumns. To see a modern genius at work had a profound impact on me. I have since converted many others from the culturally isolated north. I will be seeing him live in two weeks! If anyone has a copy of Big Time, PLEASE let me know."
5,PLEASE! POR FAVOR!,"From Bogota, Colombia. I am asking you for god's sake: please re-release this video. Por favor, a todos aquellos encargados de esto y a todos los fans de Tom un saludo y un beso. BYE!"
4,Good information,"Having not known a lot about ship modeling before reading this book, I was wiser after reading it."
2,Too Basic!,"This is a nice book FOR BEGINERS. If you're a mid-experienced model builder, this book has nothing new for you."
5,Short Tails and Treats from Three Dog Bakery,"This is one of the most intersting books I have ever read. It is funny, entertaining, and educational. It provides wonderful insight into the world of starting a business that you love. It discusses all of the hard work, and all of the rewards that accompany it. Additionally, this book was absolutely hilarious. I loved the stories about the three dogs. I have not tried the recipes yet, but they look great."
2,Interesting only if you want to start a similar firm,"This book is mostly an entrepreneurial autobiograhy, interesting only if you want to start a similar firm or know the owners personally. The writing style is annoyingly self-congratulatory. There are only a handful of recipes. If you have a bit of baking skill, you can easily come up with better ones on your own. Three Dog Bakery treats are great; the book is not. It might seem to be a natural for dog-lovers, but I wouldn't recommend it as a gift."
1,SO NOT WORTH IT,WHAT A STUPID BOOK!Total NONSENSE.Just goes to show you can get ANYTHING published these days.SO NOT WORTH YOUR MONEY.
5,SOCK MONKEY LOVERS...,"I gave this book at a baby shower with a sock monkey and some sock monkey booties, bibs, and onsies! It was the hit of the shower! Cute, cute, cute!"
1,Makes no sense.,"I love sock monkeys, so this title caught me attention.It counts down by 2's... 10, 8, 6, etc. so my 4 year oldwas totally confused. The pictures are cute. I wouldn'tbuy this again. Probably will donate this copy to the library."
1,don't waste your money!,"This book was a total disappointment. I almost didn't give it to my children as a gift because I was so embarrassed that the book was so lame. There are cute pictures and that's it. Each page says the same exact thing except the numbers change as you count down, very repetitive. You count by 2's so the book is over really fast. The last page was the worst! It doesn't rhyme or make any sense, and wasn't even clever. This book was a total waste of money."
2,10 Little Sock Monkeys,"It is just OK, thought it might be as cute as 10 Little Monkeys Jumping on the Bed. Sadly it was not."
5,Great Sci-fi film! A must see for Olivier Gruner fans!,"Automatic is an excellent film! It has a futuristic plot & a twist at the end. Loved it! Not to mention, Olivier Gruner is so handsome and has a very likeable character. He's very protective. I bought this film as soon as I found it on amazon; too bad it isn't available on DVD, at least not that I could find.Anyway, I highly recommend it!"
2,Gruner can't save this one,"After watching this movie, I felt a bit cheated. I'm a big fan of Olivier Gruner and I liked him in Nemesis, but Automatic is nowhere near the film that Nemesis is. Yes, Gruner plays the man/machine character very well, but even he can't save this film. I'm not real finicky about film details but this one is definitely not a 4 star film by ANY stretch of the imagination. The film's imagery consisted mainly of closeup shots of prop machine guns going off and sequences of bad guys' hands pulling grenade pins. The film's dialog was about as engaging as it's imagery. Even when playing the man/machine guy in other films, Gruner is still able to add depth and humanness to the character. However, he was not able to achieve this in Automatic. Blame it on poor writing, poor directing, or whatever. I'm still a fan of Olivier Gruner but this film just doesn't have it."
5,Great! Klasse! Total cool!,"What a great band! I visited their website and read an interview with the band and they were asked, what is your number one goal as a band? They answered, to have a number one hit in america. Then they were asked, what is your second goal as a band? And they answered, to have a number two song in america.Well, they have the right attitude and definately have the power to pull it off! Megaherz, you have my vote!Gut gemacht! Ich glaube mit Himmelfahrt sie haben eine gute chance, viel glueck und spass. Danke, Dankeshoen!"
2,Not even close to Rammstein,"Unlike Rammstein, Megaherz is much more guitar driven and uses much less electronics. Except for the first song, it really isn't that hard of a cd when you compare it to Sehnsucht. If you are looking for somthing harder than Rammstein, keep looking. It's not a bad cd, but it is not as hard as people make it sound. The cd does have 3 or 4 good songs, but nothing that rocks like Das Model, Büch dich, or Du Hast. Basically, If your into more electornic stuff and already have Rammstein, and you want something heavy, your better off going with KMFDM (get Symbols) then this cd."
5,Yet another excellent German band,If you like Rammstein you'll love Megaherz... different yet very similar. Very cool cover illustration on this album and the music is very good too. Hard industrial/rock similiar to Rammstein. I love Rammstein but after you listen to a CD for many many times it gets old and this was a natural progression for me and probably most Rammstein fans out there.
3,Rammstein this is not.,"This CD is good. It has grooves that increase adrenalin. However, Rammstein it is not. The lyrics are certainly not as poetic as Rammstein. They are not literature for sure, but that is not the intent of this work I would hope. There are some nice grooves but as someone else noted, it is repetitive and generic. Still, finding metal in the German language is difficult in America and considering that fact, this CD stands apart from its English language competitors."
4,Deutsche Musik um Besten,"Upon comparing this band with Rammstein as well as Oomph!!!, I would argue that these three bands all have their equal merits. Rammstein appeals to the soul with entertaining, poetic lyrics and nearly perfect fluency with riffs. Oomph!!! is comparable to Rammstein in that the flow is very similar and the main difference is the content of lyrics in the songs...in my opinion, Oomph is not as hardcore as Rammstein. Megaherz is unique for singing about God in many of their songs and for many songs in which S & M is directly mentioned or hinted at. Despite the repetetiveness of several songs, they all stand out as wonderful songs on their own right. My favorite songs are (in order):1.Es tut weh2.Gott Sein3.Herz aus Stein4.Kopfschuss"
2,No tension,If you compare this recording to Solti/LSO there is a world of difference. Boulez is just too detached for Mahler. There is no tension. This is not a first choice.
2,Cute but small,This is adorable but not for 6-10 its just to small more on the size of 3-5 Great for a Bratz fan if they are tiny very small chair
2,Not enough space to journal,"This book gives a column for each week and a grid map for each month and that is all. There is no space alloted for email addresses, nursery listings, plans, etc. Despite being spiral bound, the book will not bend enough to make it comfortable to write on the left side. It does give plenty of information, but it is really a gardening book not a gardening journal. Those of us who make copious notes are out of luck. A cheap notebook from the grocery store would have been better."
4,Nice gardening journel,"If you're looking for a way to track your year round gardening tasks, nice book to do so. Would recommend to any gardener."
5,I love this,"I use this book in the fall, winter and spring mostly, the time when here in the north there is no gardening to do. So the book gives me this wonderful oppurtunity to record and imagine the work in the garden. It has beautiful photos, and all the content is useful and applicable."
4,From the Introduction:,"""The writer of this vivid and interesting autobiography was one of the earliest converts to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Living in Kirtland at the time the first missionaries visited that place, October, 1830, she and her parents were soon baptized. She became intimate with the parents of the Prophet Joseph Smith as well as with the Prophet, his brother, Hyrum, the Patriarch, and with all the early Saints. Her recital of those scenes of joy, of sorrow, of mobs and of constant movings and drivings is one of the most detailed descriptions ever presented. She fills in the large gaps necessarily left by many historians who give space to causes and effects rather than giving intimate pictures of daily domestic difficulties. She was a heroine in her own right, and to the last she bore her abiding testimony of the truth of the Gospel and the mission of the Prophet Joseph Smith.""-Ogden Kraut"
5,Just Right,"I love this whistler, I am move, and I can jump and workout some with the students and it stays on my fingers and is always ready to be blown"
4,Soccer Ref,When I referee soccer I love finger whistles. I like the plastic coated metal finger hold which makes it durable.
3,Decent asian horror,"It's a little more original that you might expect, and while not everything about ""Silk"" works, it has enough new and interesting ideas to make this story of scientists dealing with a captured ghost truly unforgettable. The science is fuzzy at best, and the ""Menger Cube"" stuff is nonsensical, but once you get past that and accept the story on its own terms, it's a really fun ride. The end is a little messy and doesn't make a ton of sense, but you forgive it. A fine rental."
1,Very Poor,This was a very disapointing film. Bought on the basis of other reviews but I should know better by now.The ghost scenes were so bad it was dificult to keep a straight face.Very poor. Dreadful in fact.
2,"Right size and shape, wrong color",We ordered these to go with ones our landlord installed. When put them against the wall and other racks they have a pinkish tint. Very disappointed.
2,it's o.k.,"It works great, in the sense that you don't have to blow on your NES games anymore. It's size is nice too, very compact and ""sleek"". I however, do not like that you cannot use the old school NES controllers or Zapper on it. I used it once after I bought it but ended up just buying the Yobo system because I really didn't like the controllers that came with the FC/NES. But if you don't care you can find it a tiny bit cheaper, plus you get those 8 super lame games that are fun to play once!"
5,Do It Yourselfer,Good quality product. Heavy and solid. Very easy to install. Added a nice finishing touch to my newly remodelled master bath.
5,DELICIOUS!!!!!!!,"If I could give this book more than 5 stars I would.I have several Raw Food Books - this is simply the best!The first half of the book is full of information - layout is easy to understand and follow. The second half - what a delicious treat - the recipes - it is almost sinful how good healthy raw food can taste - the pies and cookies are a must not to mention the delicious salad dressings - the salad dressings are soooo gooood! - you will just want to eat them straight out of the blender - who cares about the salad part!!!I have even e-mailed Renee with questions - really not expecting a quick answer - if an answer at all. She e-mailed me back within 24 hrs. She has another book coming out this spring which I have pre-ordered myself called ""The Balanced Plate"". I also have the DVD ""Go Further"" which is very inspirational - so check that out also. If you are a Raw Fooder or a Vegan or just thinking about eating a little healthier - shame on you if you do not get this book!!!"
5,Excellent,Im impressed how every recipe has turned out so mouthwatering. Everyone intersted in cooking should buy this.
2,"No Pics, LONG ingredients list, disappointed.","Was very hopeful this book would be a good starting point for vegan, vegetarian recipes. After reading other reviews I thought I'd be happy with this book. I was wrong, no pictures at all, I like pics to see what the dish is supposed to look like, ingredients list for many recipes is very long and time consuming methods, You would think raw food wouldn't take that long to prepare! The first half of the book has no recipes at all, just an explanation of the different foods. Pretty disappointed to be honest, i'm already looking for a different book."
5,The Art and Spirit of Raw Foods,Great gourmet recipes for raw foods. All the recipes I have tried were great. A lot of great information about the different foods used in the recipes. I would recommend this book for anyone who is intersted in getting started with raw foods. You will love them if you try these recipes
3,Provides the basics,"I'm disappointed in this book. It is very detailed in the basics of various foods, preparations, and tools, but not enough information about incorporating or transitioning to raw food diet. I don't want to be overwhelmed with the how-to's. I was looking for a book that provided an easy path to incorporating more raw foods into my vegetarian diet. Maybe the recipes are there but . . .Living Cuisine: The Art and Spirit of Raw Foods (Avery Health Guides)"
3,questionable logic,"Good index and explanation of basics. Sites Weston Price to support eating living greens, talks about x factor and then goes on to ignore &/or recommend the opposite of Price's conclusions with no explanation to why she uses his work to support his work and then ignores with no explanation his recommendations. Says milk & butter aren't good but sites industrial milk's negatives to support that recommendations and ignores that those are the very sources of Price's x factor. Some good recipes and ideas to incorporate more fresh foods. Some decent basic information. But if I am question her basic research and hypothesis then that undermines my faith in the information that I am not educated enough to evaluate, like the the validity of various sprouts, etc.I will make some of the recipes but many are complicated, many with three different preparations and then put the three things together. Also, many call for dehydrating."
3,"Very good, but not a masterpiece","This is indeed a very good movie, astonishingly made if you think the low bugetd it had. But I do not think it's the masterpiece a lot of people think it is.It has passed the test of time, no doubt about that, due to its incredible photography."
5,I do advocate it *most* earnestly... ;],"Halfway between playing a pimp in the immortal _Taxi Driver_ and portraying every other kind of legendary character, Harvey Keitel got involved in a Ridley Scott project with Keith Carradine and the rest is collector's edition history.Set in France during the Napoleonic Era, two young soldiers get into a fight over the usual nonsense and their vendetta spans a generation. Great action scenes, romance and the scarcely believable (to me anyway) feat of capturing the _light_ of Central Europe... It has been called ""a staggeringly beautiful film"" and with that assessment I will not contend... Yes, ""I do advocate it most earnestly"" :)"
5,Clothes make the movie,"The old saying that clothes make the man can be said for ""The Duellists."" This is one of the few period films I've ever watched where I've been very, very aware of the talents of the costumers. ""Huh?,"" you may ask. Yes, this film has much to praise, but I perfer to praise the costumes because in no other film about the Napoleonic era have I ever seen the spendor of La Grande Armée so vividly portrayed. And yet, there are no massive battle scenes or shots of thousands of troops marching down the road. The granduer of Napoleon's troops are summarized in the accuracy and beauty of the uniforms worn by just a handful of actors and extras. Yet, the uniforms on screen speak volumes about the unseen Napoleon and his campaigns. Director Ridley Scott and costume designer Tom Rand make the Napoleonic period come alive in a way that no other filmmakers (with much larger budgets) have ever achieved."
3,Interesting,"This is an interesting film with a good cast. It is notfast paced but does have a good plot. Albert Finney is alwaysgreat, whatever the role.I like this movie."
3,Carradine and Keitel stink up an otherwise visually stunning film,"Beautifully filmed, tremendous sets, costumes and historical details.Ridley Scotts' talent is much in evidence.Why, in the midst of tight, competent performances by a supporting cast they dropped two wooden, stiff, and just plain awful performances by Keith Carradine and Harvey Keitel I can't fathom.Was it economic I wonder? Did these guys have enough box office pull in 1977 that would override these turd-like performances?I don't know but it's really a shame because it takes the edge off a film that might have been legitimately great had the two leads been better cast.Still, once you get past the fact that every time the two actors open their mouth you'll be disappointed, the rest of the film is quite worthwhile and it's unique premise, a series of duels over twenty years, pulls you into the story line, especially if, like me, you like historical dramas."
3,One decent duel could have finished the film in 10 minutes.,"I'm not sure why, but this DVD disappointed me.The story of an on going feud between two soldiers of extremely different personalities is interesting but it was just too long and one of endless sword fights (Yep, I know it is called the Duellists but couldn't we have a litle more variety in the fighting ?) Maybe some mud wrestling or darts? If I hear the clash of steel on steel again it will be way too soon.The scenery was beautiful, but I felt the movie lacked that something which grabs your attention and makes you sit forward in your chair hanging onto every word."
3,Better value elsewhere,"I cannot believe some of the ratings that this DVD has gotten here, granted some of the scenery is brilliant but as for the story line well it has much to be desired for one soldier goes to arrest another for dueling and he challenges the arresting officer to a duel, I cannot imagine any army in world regardless of the era allowing a person being arrested to be able to challenge the arresting officer to a duel and to allow this attitude to go on for 15 years. Considering the cast and director they act like it is their first film so straight.I purchased this DVD because watching it is a requirment of a course what a waste of money Three stars for the scenery one for the story line or acting."
1,I Beg Your Pardon!,"These people have got to be kidding! Better to watch an endless tape loop - the only thing that changes is the age of the characters. The most interesting thing in this film was Carradine's mustache. Boring, stupid, awful, nonsense!"
5,Superb,"""The Duelists"" This is a believable ,though terrifying, story of a man helplessly captured in another man's obcession tokill him formally in a duel... time, and time again."
5,Excellent Napoleonic Movie about duelling and men of honour,"This is a great movie that spans throught the Napoleonic era from around the time of the Battle of Jena through Waterllo, and goes into the restoration. Beautiful scenes of European countrysides.Very good sword fights, even a sabre fight which is rare in western movies. Harvey Keitel puts through a powerful performance and so does Keith Carradine. Lots of icons of cinema like Edward Fox and Albert Finney. this was a time of honour when gentlemen duelled over the smallest and insignifcant reason. Very accurate Hussar uniforms. An a very good scene of he tragdey of the retreat from Moscow. No battle scenes though."
5,Scott's first film a stunner,"Overshadowed by his later, more successful works, The Duelist is one of Scott's finest films. Scott is frequently damned with faint praise about his abilities as a visual stylist. What's missing is his attention to theme, character and story details. While some of his narratives can be muddled (look at Someone To Watch Over Me or even his classic Blade Runner as examples), he never loses sight of character and theme and their importance to his films.This film, along with Alien, Thelma & Louise and Blade Runner ranks as one of his best films."
2,Super Reader,"It is Chloe's turn to have the meteor freak thing happen to her. During a fireworks display, one of those green meteorites lets a few particles fall that head Chloe Sullivan's way.The effect is not overly serious, except for the fact that every guy around wants her. Even a famous artist friend of Lex's. When it wears off, he still wants her badly enough to kidnap her."
4,Like watching a new episode of Smallville,"This is a book targeted for teens, but I am way past teenage and I enjoyed it too. I enjoyed this book because I am a big fan of Smallville, the TV show and having watched all 218 episodes, I am now reading as many of the books as I can find to extend my enjoyment.Even if you were not familiar with the TV series or Superboy story, you would get enough background to make the story easy to understand.It is a fun story and could very well have been an episode in the TV series."
4,Newbie and I got it!!,"This book has been out for quite a while now and even now, in 2006 the book is still helpful. I'm new to the Capoeira lifestyle and reading this book has been extremely helpful in gaining more knowledge about the history as well as the many different movements involved with this awesome martial art.I definitely recommend this book to newbies and more seasoned capoeristas. I may be a little ""slow"" but while the illustrations are great, I got a little confused when trying to ""flow"" through the movements but by reading, you'll figure it out and they'll begin to feel right.Hope this helps...enjoy!"
2,This is ugly,"sorry to say but only good song on here is ""No One Like You"" By the scorpions. There are much better best of 80's cds out there than this."
2,are you serious???,80's metal collection with BILLY SQUIRE? guess we'll be seeing a new one soon with celine dion...she did sing ac/dc's you shook me all night long(guess she's metal also).
4,Introducing the Quilliam Sisters.,"This book is fun. Looks like the begining of a series that features two sleuthing sisters who run Hemlock Falls Inn. Sarah owns the Inn and her sister, Meg is the chef. We are brought into the towns annual festival, whose highlight is a reenactment of 17th century witch trials, which ends in a mock excution of a witch by stones; which becomes all to real. The victim, a guest from the Inn. The murderer...anyone in town.... The sisters rely on their skill for catching culprits."
3,Ho Hum,"This book is fine if you're looking to kill time at the beach or on a plane. It's not great literature, but the plot moves along enough to keep your interest. A few too many extraneous characters to keep track of, but overall, not too bad."
3,It was great! Totally put me to sleep!,"I like books that put me to sleep. If I can read a chapter before bed without staying up all night to find out what is going to happen, I am happy. So I was very happy with this book!"
3,An American Collection,"This is a VERY small book, smaller than a cd case. The illustrations are great and it gives a very general overview of Mucha's life. I purchased this book as a reference for a report on Mucha for a college level class and it was definitely not very useful for that purpose.The author does not cite any resources for the information in the book and other than looking good on the bookshelf it was not worth the price."
3,Weightlifting on a down day,This workout has a large varitey of weight-lifting moves. I am an advanced exerciser and found the work-out to be semi-challenging. I would do this workout on a down-day.
5,Tough workout,"This is an intense weight lifting DVD--not for those with weak spirits, but great if you really want a challenge. I prefer to divid the DVD up amoung 3 days/workouts (1 bi's/tri's, 2 shoulds/chest, 3 legs). Amy does use a large variety of equiptment, but I found that I could modify any of the moves that I did not have the exact equipment for. (For example, I do not own a body bar, but used hand weights or my husband's pull up bar that grips onto a door frame instead. I also do not own a large ""bench press bar,"" but have found ways to modify with hand weights.) I used to strictly lift weights in a gym weight room, but now I get a much tougher workout w/amy (or Kathy Smith) in my living room! I am stronger, more toned, and weigh about the same, but am overall smaller and leaner (down a pant size and a bra size). I find Amy to be a very motivational instructor!"
2,Great price - low quality,"These burner covers are made using extremely thin metal. I like the design on them, but the colors are very different in person than the colors shown in the photo. The actual colors are more like a khaki/tan with orange/pink hearts with aqua accents. Plus, the burner covers rust in the dishwaser."
1,Garbage (I wish I could give -5 stars),"This is the first book I have ever actually ripped up and thrown in the trash. These guys are smarmy little children. They constantly interject their political jibes and this kills any fun the book might be. (Which is actually very little) The humor is lame. Most of their descriptions could have been written by a robot. Very little in the way of stories about the places they write about. To top it off.... and this is important... The book is completely out of date! The description doesnt tell you that it has to be about 14 years old from what I can tell.Dont waste your time and money on this , and I use this term loosely, ""book"".I'd ask for my money back, but I enjoyed ripping it up even more."
2,Save Yourselves!,"This book is helpful if you want to know where to eat, drink, and get an STD in Europe. The authors spend a lot of time telling you where not to go, what not to see, how to cheat and offend Europeans, and lest we forget, when and where to get drunk and laid. The pedantic tone of the book is heavy and annoying. If you want to remember your trip and keep yourself disease-free, I suggest you find another guidebook. Lonely Planet is a great one!"
3,"Too academic for me, but well done!","I am hesitant to NOT recommend this book because it IS very well done. However, I was not expecting a text book format. I thought it was more like a fun read - bullets, maybe a few pictures, something my dad would like as a big fart fan. I'm a big nerd myself and I couldn't get past the first couple of pages because I found it too boring and academic. If you're looking for a true cultural history, I'm sure it's perfect. But if you're looking for easy entertainment, this is NOT the book for you, unless you want to have a thesaurus at your side to look up several words on each page."
3,Mixed bag...,"I got this as a gag gift for my husband since I think he has a natural gift for crepitating. It started off real strong and funny. Then I read chapters for farts in the literature, Bibles, historical letters, and movies. There were interesting and funny information scattered about but it was overall pretty boring.I also have to agree with a previous reviewer - I cannot believe someone did this much research on farting. That, in it of itself, is pretty humorous."
5,blasts away the cobwebs,"I bought this book expecting it to be rather more of a ""how-to"" guide than it turned out to be. That said, it was still immensely useful and exposes many myths. I, for one, had mistakenly subscribed to that well-known myth that Arabs consider it the height of good manners to break wind during and after a meal. Sadly, this is untrue. If only I had had this book *before* I dined with the secretary-general of OPEC in '96!"
5,A great variety of Irish performances,"From a medley of songs to introduce you to the singers to one bidding you farewell this tape is jam-packed with music of all sorts. You can hear Richie O'Shea sing the ballad Streets of New York, the beautiful Isle of Innisfree sung by Carmel Quinn, the young Reagan Family step dancers, the light-hearted Don't Bother to Knock and My Irish Molly, the Irish Favorite Danny Boy and even a solo bagpiper. Something for everyone."
3,Film falls way short of expectation,"The director does not do justice to Shannon Tweed's porn acting expertise and she is hardly exposed well enough for viewers to get a feel that they are watching a steamy movie. Neither can the movie be justified as an action movie as the reason why you would want to watch the movie is 'cos of lovely Shannon. The action is hardly convincing and I was just waiting for the movie to end. There are only 2 hot scenes involving Shannon - one of them below avg. and the other just avg. Summary - there are other better ""action"" movies."
4,A CLASSIER AND BETTER VERSION OF THE FIRST,"A more interesting story line than the first Night Eyes. Better acting, Better locations, better wardrobe. A step above."
3,More Results-Oriented Job Descriptions,"I can use or adapt the models, or learn to make their own. And all the descriptions are included on a free, easy-to-use computer disk. This book helps my company:** prepare job descriptions tied to business goals ** communicate expectations clearly ** improve employee job performance ** save time and money"
3,This product was too flaky.,"This product had a pleasant scent, but the main issue was that it flaked too much. Also, the product starts to dehydrate rather fast."
5,Great for beginners,This is an excellent book for beginners. My 5 year old kindergartner enjoyed the story. He was also pleased with himself when he realized he could read! The way the author laid this out was perfect. They list the words in the front of the book so your child can learn how to spell them first. I plan on buying this entire set.
2,"Cute idea, but not as good as the others in the series","The idea for this book is definitely a cute one and the illustrations are adorable, but the writing just isn't as appealing or as enjoyable to read as the other books in the series, like Ten Little Dinosaurs and Solar System SOS. I had originally bought this to give as a gift, but decided to return it after reading it myself."
1,Read the back of the book,if you were to read the back of the book that's as entertaining as it gets . the book is a bunch of fairytales and not very good ones at that . I do not recommend.
5,highly recommended,"this volume is a hidden jewel, what a wonderful discovery! A fascinating interweaving of several traditions, well told, very readable."
2,The American Standard of Perfection: A Complete Description of All Recognized Varieties of Fowls,"When I looked up the book, I was hoping to find a newer edition. I misread the description and thought it was a newer version but when the package shower up, a retro version was awaiting me! The pictures are not in color, I'm a spoiled Gen X, but all in all, it is accomplishing what we need. I'm still on the lookout for a present edition."
4,A beautiful introduction to a beautiful technology... but wait for the second edition,"I just read the beta version of the second edition cover to cover in just a couple of days, and I love it, the content as well as the exposition. The first edition only gets four stars, though, because the second edition contains a lot of updates worth waiting for. Even in its rought beta state it's a great resource, and I'm looking forward to seeing the finished book."
5,Best Technical Book Ever,"This book was the first book that drawed me into Ruby and Rails. There is something alluring about how this book was written, or maybe the sleek programming language (Ruby) and the framework (Rails) themselves are so attractive that I were drawn into it.This book is one of those rare technical books that is so light to read page after page, after each page, you know you have learn something good. When it is over, you just wish there could be just another chapter."
4,A very good book...I thought it was well presented...,"I thought the book was well written , concise with plenty of examples--especially the part about the css style sheets. I myself will recommend this book to any one who is interested in web development as I have currently used much of their work in my client sites such as:[...]Take a look of what I have implemented as it pertains to the book"
3,Thin pages.,"This book's content is fine but the pages are really thin. They remind of bible pages, that is my only complaint."
4,Great Job,"I just want to thank the people I bought this book from. Being a college student, I waited until the last minute to make sure I really needed the book. When I got on Amazon and bought the book I was hoping it would be here in no time, and that was the case exactly. Thanks for the fast shipping and the book!"
5,You like counrty? Did you like the '80's? This is 4 you!,"So, you like country, and you like the '80's. Have you had a problem finding all you favorite '80's country music in one place? Well, with this album you can probably stop looking.I personally found all my favorite '80's country music here.With such songs as: ""It Aint Easy Being Easy,"" ""Sweet Country Music,"" ""You & I"", ""Don't go to Strangers,"" ""Islands in the Stream"" and may other '80's country hits.Pick up the last true country compilation album. This was just before crossing over, or ""country-pop"" became common-place.Great album!"
2,boring,"Too boring for my taste. Yes, there's lots of male nudity, but .... You know how nudists say that there's nothing sexy about their gatherings? That's how this film was shot. You'll see naked guys hiking, playing in the water, posing for pictures, but it's all SO platonic and innocent, I just couldn't get into it. I didn't find the guys all that hot, and there weren't enough closeup shots."
1,Worst Ever,"The rating should not even be 1 star - it should be 0. This is the absolute worst book I have ever read. The title is ""Haunted Chicago"". However, the book talks very little about ""Haunted Chicago"". Ninety-nine percent of the book is devoted to the history of Chicago and not the hauntings of Chicago. That would not be so bad as I love the city and read everything I can about it; but, much of the history reported in this book has conflicting details with the other material I have read on the history of Chicago. The grammatical and spelling errors in this book are so prevalant that it is actually unpleasant to read and sometimes you are left trying to figure out what he is trying to say. A very disappointing read."
1,Double yuck.,"I bought this with ""Bloody Chicago"" by the same author and am now thoroughly disgusted. The author's books lack any theory, any journalistic savvy, any insight. I felt like I was reading a high school paper that had been lifted from the internet. After half the book, I gave up. A friend had taken me on the author's tour in Decatur (in central Illinois--decidedly not Chicago, though charming in a different way and in its own right). The tour was not led by him but another guide, and it was fascinating. Unlike this book. Perhaps the author's book on Decatur is better, as our guide on the tour told us Taylor grew up there. I won't be finding out, though! Again, try Ursula Bielski's ""Chicago Haunts"" series for everything anyone will ever need to know about haunted Chicago. I'm off ghost books for awhile!"
1,Gross,"This stuff tastes awful. Maybe my expectations were off, but wow, this will ruin any and every coffee drink. I'd go with Hershey's syrup for a mocha before turning to this garbage any day."
4,Very well done!,"Jonathan Russell has done a real service to the Taiji community in publishing this book on the Taiji ""Dance"" or San Shou.Jonathan's teacher, T.T. Liang, learned this fairly rare Form from Xiong Yang Ho, a student of Yang Jian Ho (2nd generation of Yang Style). In order to make the Taiji San Shou (which might be called ""prearranged sparring"") accessible to people who were primarily interested in the health benefits of Taiji Quan, Master Liang called it a ""Dance"" and arranged the movements in regular ""beats"" which he set to music. So it becomes a pleasant practice method.However, within this innocuous-appearing ""Dance, "" a serious practionercan find many usable combat applications of Taiji Quan.The book is very clear and well put together.Needless to say, for any real achievement in the Taiji ""Dance,"" the student should first have reasonable mastery in the Taiji Solo Form and Push Hands."
2,oh please,"For crying out loud, we've heard these songs *a thousand times* already. We do NOT need to have them all gathered up and thrown on the same disc. If you like Jefferson Starship, pick up the Dragon Fly and Red Octopus albums. Don't settle for ""Miracles"" when the band is clearly capable of more than just that song played over and over.Foreigner is a major disappointment as well. Pick up their very first album to find some lost classics. The Steve Miller Band was much better in the late 60's and early 70's when they were experimenting with ideas, such as on the Children of the Future album.People buy these comps to remember the past, but I have a better idea- start making some NEW memories by ignoring this compilation and by checking out the bands regular studio albums. I already gave you some advice for Jefferson Starship and Steve Miller. Don't settle for just the big hits."
3,brief and concise reference,"As the title suggests,this is not meant to be a textbook of genetics.The basic purpose of this book is to put across key points and concepts in a simple,concise fashion for easy understanding. This book is most useful if you already have some exposure to genetics through classes or more traditional texts.The strength of this book lies in its clear,brief and logical presentation of topics with good cross referencing.It would be especially useful to students before examinations when reading through lengthy texts or notes is not practical"
1,it did not work after 3-4 times usage,I am really disappointed with this product. It broke after few days. i am not able to press food and i did not like the utensil.
5,It's awesome,"Hawkins Pressure Cooker is really good. I had a ""Prestige"" earlier in which the washer broke and got misplaced. So, I bought this one. Prestige was leaking out water every time it whistled and made a mess of everything. Hawkins never leaks, when it whistles. And it cooks everything thoroughly. So, it does what it is supposed to do damn well. And that is all that is needed. The only thing about Hawkins that is a little bit of a problem is opening the lid and closing it. It can sometimes be frustratingly difficult to do that. But, this is just a minor trick that you need to get used to. So, everything considered, this is a great pressure cooker."
4,Cooker,"This is not the first Hawkins product that I have purchased but this one is fast. The one think that caught me by surprise was how the pressure works and the sound it makes during cooking. I was not accustomed to hearing that so it scared me at first because I thought it was going to blow the weight or gasket, instead of a constant whistle it made short burst of steam. Overall I am satisfied with this product."
5,Perfect Little Pot,"For years, I avoided pressure cookers like the plague - I was so wrong. This little pot is a real time saver in addition to being a wonderful tenderizer. I have cooked round steak and chuck roast and a fork slides through both of them - no knife required. Pork chops, pork ribs - perfect. Green beans and potatoes in no time, and the texture of the potatoes beats boiling any day. Brown rice comes out chewy and tender, but not gummy. And dried beans - I've done pintos and great northerns, as well as black-eyed peas (and hoppin' john). I have never been successful cooking beans the way I wanted them - until now. Buy this pot - it cleans up like a dream and purrs along at just a notch below medium without using up all the liquid - no sticking of meat, grain, or vegetable. Why did I wait so long?"
5,best ever,this is a great product cooks fast and tasty meals.make sure you read instructions book to operate correctly.the lid is different but effective instruction book states exactly how to use it.meat comes out tender and moist no matter how tough meat is.the price is reasonable and quality is high.
3,Will rate again after I've figured out how to use it,"Is it normal to be intimidated by instructions that appear to be too detailed? I think the problem might be that I was sent a top too big for the 2 liter bottom pan. Should the top sit on top of the pan very loosely? Or should the bottom rim of the top fit INSIDE the pan? Because mine doesn't fit inside. I'm giving 3 stars for the immediate shipment and I'd love to revise my review with additional stars if I can figure out how to put the 2 pieces together, or get the correct fitting lid without having to go thru hoops. Also,there seems to be an additional piece - a steamer type thing for which I could find no instuctions on its purpose or use."
2,Do Not Use on Glass Stove Tops,"This thing ruined my halogen stove top. It scratched a top that seemingly was unscratchable. It would be great for a gas range, but not for a halogen stove top. Damn! Not sure what I can do to fix it."
1,Scratches all over,"I got this cooker with scratches all over the lid and looked like its used ; I ordered two replacements, and they all had the same problem. Got fed up and kept the last one. Very disappointing to see the scratches since I ordered a new cooker"
3,Pressure Cooker,"January 02,2012I bought this pressure cooker last year.Its brochure on line was attractive enough for me to buy it.However, upon opening the package, I saw a very small,compact-likecooking pan.Probably this will be practical for a one-peron household but notfor a regular size family.I felt that it is quite expensive in terms of its actual cost,compared with its actual size.Thank you for the chance to review this item"
5,Very Nice Pressure Cooker,This product is very good if not the best one available in the market. Very easy to use and does the job perfectly.
2,Didn't like it,"It says real olive brine in the description, then when I got it the ingredients say ""water, salt, lactic acid"". Didn't taste much like olive juice to me."
1,"Product ok, this distributor misleading customers","This product from this supplier is a complete ripoff. You are getting 12.67 ounce bottles (which is not disclosed in Amazon listing) instead of 25 oz bottles from Boscoli through Amazon at only a bit more in cost. Buy their product, not from this vendor. Quality of Boscoli as good or better.PS: this is not the fault ot the Santa Barbara Olive Company, it is this distributor misleading customers"
3,Pretty good,"But not GREAT. I actually tasted more salt than olives so I had to take a few stars off for that. It does work well if you have some blue cheese stuffed olives to throw in your drink. Not a total loss, but I don't think I'll buy again."
3,Babylon - Bologna A.D.,"Another Vin Diesel tough guy movie. This movie is not one of his best, but it keeps you awake. what kind of gang runs and jumps like monkeys? not the kind of ending you would expect from the Hero either.you decide."
3,Better than I was expecting....,"Picked this movie up at Target today... the two-disk S.E. (wanted to see the features). Before watching I read the one review posted here on Amazon - the one star one. So I was expecting this to be a real stinker - or at least something along the lines of ""Doomsday"". But instead it wasn't all that bad of an action movie. The only complaint I might have is the ending is a bit abrupt and doesn't seem finished. I'll probably pick up the book and read it later."
1,Winner of the worst planned picture award,"About 45 minutes into it I was thinking that people were wrong and this seemed to be a great movie. Suddenly, without warning... Someone decided to go crazy on me and spliced up scenes that make zero sense, an out-of-control story line and... was that romance they were trying? Where did THAT come from?This looks like a picture where the Director didn't have a clear path to an end, ran outta money and couldn't film the transitions between scenes he'd already shot. The result is a great first half followed by something that'll make you wonder if you drink was spiked. Also out of place are some great effects in the first half, then something that resembles 1969 effects in the later half. So bad you won't know to whether to laugh, or cringe and feel sorry for someone.Can't recommend buying, but if you get the chance to see it for free it's worth watching just for the historical aspect of how a good movie idea turns stupid in the wrong hands."
3,Story line sub par,I think all the actors where great. The story line could have been better worked.
3,disappointing,"The first hour of this movie was great. Part Blade runner, part Children of Men, part Mad Max.But the last 1/2 hour was confusing, boring and anticlimactic.This was a bummer."
3,Vin Diesle Just Needs A Hug!,"Babylon Ad is an about average end of the world sci-fi hero fights against incredible odds to emerge victorious. Is it silly? Quite a bit; is it Fun? Quite a bit; is it exciting? Quite a bit; is it visual? Quite a bit. Is it moving? Not a bit. Is it a complete waste of time? Not quite.If you want a fun violent action film, and want to turn your brain off, then Babylon AD may be just what you're looking for. It's noBlade Runner - The Final Cut (Two-Disc Special Edition)but then what is?2 *"
3,Disc Is Mastered Badly,"I don't have a problem about the movie, it self; it is a Vin Diesel flick. True, there could have been more footage; that would give the story more depth. But the movie was okay.My problem is with how the bit rate was chump-changed. The bit rate generally stayed at 4 and below. I haven't seen a DVD mastered this badly in over 12 years.Everyone decided that the movie was bad, so they even gave us a crappy video experience. Corporate America sucks! So, my question is: did they screw-up the BluRay version, too?"
3,Babylon A.D.,"Although my wife and I usually love most of Vin Diesel's work, especially the SciFi, this was a disappointment to both of us. The story is to familiar, the acting decent, and the effects good, but this just didn't stick out in a crowd of Apocalyptic movies. This seemed very much like ""Children of Men"" in story. A top mercenary is hired to excort a young pregnant female to safety. Take away the cloning and there is very little difference. I suggest this one as a rental. Decent quality DVD with very little replayability. If you enjoyed this catch ""Resident Evil: Extinction"".CA Luster"
2,Good beginning - lousy end,The movie had a lot of action and suspense thoughout until you got to the very end. A real waste of time and money. The writer and director should be ashamed. If you really want to watch this DVD - let the end remain a mystery - turn it off.
3,It's O.K.,"This is not the best movie Vin Diesel has been in and Vin's the only reason I got it. The action takes a long time to warm up and the storyline is basically the same as ""Cyborg"". It's good for one or two viewings, but that's about all."
2,Disappointing,"It seemed interesting, but honestly it felt like this movie was just filming without a direction. You never really understand the purpose of some characters, scenes seem randomized, and the ending was like they wanted to make a shocking twist but in the end you just are thinking why did I watch this film. Honestly this film was a huge disappointment."
2,Ummmm...you may ne shaking your head at the end,"At the conclusion of this movie, I was thinking to myself... what the? I don't know where to start, but some of the camera work early in parts of the movie where terrible; with camera angles changing every two seconds or so, making it extremely difficult to follow the action. The peculiar mannerisms of Aurora (Melanie Thierry) were maddening to the point that you wished Vin Diesel, as Toorop or Michelle Yeoh, as Sister Rebekah would put some tape over her mouth to shut her up. Speaking of Michelle Yeoh. She was mis-cast in this thing of a movie. Terrible job on her part. She may have been added only to spice up the action scenes with her Martial Arts. Other than that, she wasn't very interesting. And Gerard Depardieu's part was useless and laughable. I can't be subjective about a movie that was too fragmented to make any sense. Ugh."
1,BAD Copy of Movie!!,"The movie I received from this seller was just a bad, cheap homemade copy. It was actually missing large portions of the movie-and I've seen this movie a few times before deciding to buy it, so I know when I'm being ripped off and parts are missing! Not worth my time and money to return so I will be purchasing a new one elsewhere!!"
1,Worst movie ever...,This is the worst movie I have ever seen. I use this movie with my wife when we watch other movies as the standard for worst movie ever. I ask her after we watch a movie that we did not enjoy was it as bad as Babylon A.D.. And thus far the answer has been no
2,Slow,Very slow movie. Lost me and I love SciFi but this one was at a lost for me. I love Michelle in all her movies. But not even this one could not be saved.
2,Not Director's Cut,"This is a good movie but, Missing parts of movie that tie things together. Fast shipping, good quality and had security seal."
1,disappointing,I love Michel Yeoh. I love Vin Diesel. This was badly written. I have no empathy for the characters. There was nothing for me to look forward to but the end.
1,Redefining the meaning of uncut!!!!,"This is a review of the DVD itself not the movie!Don't waste you time on this movie. I saw this movie in the theaters and was severely disappointed in the DVD. The movie is missing several scenes that may or may not add to the plot line but for me were still part of the movie. If your familiar with the movie you will recognize the absence of the chase and ending scene with Vin and the two children. I believe they CUT an extra 10-15 minutes from the movie. You will also notice a change in some of the voice over during the beginning of the movie. I like the movie, its worth watching but not this version."
3,I liked it except for the end,"I didn't think the movie was that bad. It was sold as an action movie and it delivered. The only real problem for me was the disconnected ending that felt like a chunk was missing. I understand the ""raw and uncut"" dvd release will resolve this problem. Looking forward to owning it."
1,Babylon B.A.D.,"This was one god-awful festering terd of a movie. It was a total waste of my time and money. It was not only uninteresting, it made no sense either. Vin Diesel is washed up if this is the best he can do. My advice is to skip it."
1,Really Bad,"I'm a Vin Diesel fan and I was really disappointed with this movie. Bad story, bad lines, and bad fight scenes."
1,Even the director hates this movie,"When I first started watching I was happy. Then about 30 mins later I started lauaghing at the corneyist snowmoblie chase and then a touching"" I love you man, can I have your bud light?"" moment ever. Then I cried because my brain tried to kill me for sitting thru the etire move. WTF! Even the DIRECTOR said this movie was direct quote "" Stupid and violent"". I've seen better straight to video THAI movies where I couldn't even understand the language and had the budget of an american teens weekly allowance. I gave this a one star because amazon doesn't have a picture of a middle finger poking the eye out of a puppy."
1,USED DVD,I bought this product and it was supposed to be new. Instead it looked like a boot-legged copy inside of the box. It was a gift and I was very embarrassed.
4,Babylon AD,"This movie was based on a Georges Dantec ""Babylon Babies"". While not a faithful reproduction of Mr. Dantec's novel, it managed to catch the tone and emotional flavor of the book. Vin Diesel did a good job playing Toorop, the central character."
3,Cross-country body count flick,"Simple premise: drop Vin Diesel into some collapsing world of the future, give him A Quest with A Fair Maiden, arrange for plenty of guns, and stand back. Having Charlotte Rampling there for some sneering just makes it better.The tech-grunge look of that imagined world comes across very effectively. One fight scene in a dogtown warren full of scaffolding is among the best-choreographed I've seen. The Fair Maiden is cute, but this is a guns'n'chases flick, so chastity rules. And the ending simply defies all logic. It's touching, but don't - just don't try to figure out why that payload incurs the price it does. That part just doesn't make any sense.But, if anyone wanted a movie that made sense, they wouldn't have given Diesel a gun. Cool shoot-em-up action prevails, and that's all this movie was really about. Oh, and Michelle Yeoh showing some cool moves.-- wiredweird"
2,And then.....?,"I picked up this movie from the video store, since my wife is infatuated with Vin Diesel, and I can't remember being disappointed by any of his movies.Until now.The actions scenes are average, the hand-to-hand fighting flashes by on the screen so fast it is as if the filmmakers were embarrassed to even have them in the movie, and the dialog is lacking.Heck, my wife fell asleep halfway through. Did I mention she's infatuated with Diesel?And yes, the futuristic aspect and the subtle stab at religion is there, but it's not worth your time or money to watch this movie. Maybe catch it on HBO or whatever..."
5,I'm writing just to up the positives.,"This film in no way rates the 1 star ratings people have been giving it. It's a very realistic look at where we are heading in a world lead by the fear of terrorism and corporate greed. Hyper inflation, third world poverty, the systematic breakdown of civilization is just a reflection of were we are heading today. This is a story of hope within those times."
1,Just Plain Bad,I love Vin and I hate to trash this movie... but it stinks! It has no plot worth spending the time watching. Give this one a pass.
4,Why does everyone hate Vindesil,"This was actually a pretty entertaining movie. You can't automatically hate it just because of who stars in it. If you like action and scifi, I would recommend this movie."
1,Babylon A.D. Movie Review,"If I was being honest, I would say that this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It had potential to be alright, but the story didn't make sense at ALL. And it just kept getting weirder and more nonsensical. I am honestly sad that I wasted time and money on this movie. Do humanity a favor and rent/buy something else."
2,"Grim, Grey, Meh","This film keeps wanting to be Riddick, or Pitch Black, or Thunderdome, and even has themes out of Resident Evil and the Fifth Element --it borrows bits from a lot of cool sci-fi movies of the last twenty years, but it doesn't quite click. There are some interesting action scenes, like flying missile drones chasing snowmobiles, but it seems to swing from expensive FX scenes, to grim, urban, post apocalypse scenes, which would be fine, except there are no zombies. If you're going to have monochrome gray post-apocalypse scenes you need zombies, unless you're doing a Eastern European love story, in which case, you need zombies shagging. The whole thing could have been shot in black and white and you'd have never noticed the difference.The upside is that you do get to see Vin Diesel growl at people and blow stuff up, which I think we've all missed."
1,"""Babbling And Drear"" would be a better title","Combine a wooden, uninspiring performance by Vin Diesel, which happens to be the best performance in the film, with a confusing surrealistic plot that takes apostate bits and parts of Christianity and twists them together for its ""religious"" theme and you end up with ... nothing. It relies on special effects and glitz to try to put some life into the film, but fails at that miserably. My copy is going in the circular file."
2,Its ok,Love SciFi But this one was a let down. i am not sure where it was going. Love Michelle in this one. But she couldn't save this one. I know that it feels almost like the one with Bruce Willis in it.
3,I tunes don't work in Brazil,"People,Wen i try to get the digital copy on Itunes, it don't work. It shows that the code isn't correct. Maybe someone have a solution !"
4,"Great Concept, poor delivery","I can't say this film is an Oscar winner, but it is not as bad as many reviewers indicate. The problem with the movie is that it has a poor delivery; i personally think it lacked a bit more action. The concept and the idea of future world are great, but you need more detail, more story line, and that is where it fails. Perhaps if maybe another director would have taken a shot at it, it could have been broader, better. We have to understand that are tons of great concept movies with a bad delivery, this is one of them. The movie is not total garbage, it's worth the rent, go check it out."
1,"This movie should be a thing of the PAST,",I almost forgot this movie right after leaving the theatre. The action scenes are ridiculous. There's neither excitement nor suspense. The plot is bare bone. The acting is bland. Michelle Yeoh is a good actor but she had nothing to work on.The money this film made at the box office accurately reflects how bad it is.
2,Not Buying It,"Nope,I'm not buying it--either the movie itself or the premise that deep inside this is a really good movie ruined by bad editing, inattentive audiences, or the evil designs of the Tooth Fairy. Babylon AD is an almost incomprehensible set of action sequences set mostly in a Mad Max post-apocalyptic future, and nothing more. Vin hits people, Vin shoots people, people hit and shoot Vin, and stuff blows up all over the place, and nothing else in the movie is anything more than a thinly disguised way to get from one action sequence to another. Does that make it a bad movie? Depends on your criteria, I guess. I thought my time had been wasted, but then, you might not. Just don't expect more than things going boom."
5,Beautiful,I would rate this rug as a five because it is beautiful and well made. I loved the design on the rug. It is perfect for any area. I would recommend this rug to anyone that loves Mickey Mouse and unusual items.
2,Poor Attention to Detail in Kindle Conversion,"Here is my difficulty. Bought the book, read it, found it really interesting.If only it was well converted as well. Being a bit of a perfectionist myself I really like an ebook to be well generated. Spotting a few spelling errors or other small flaws in a book does not bother me. The quality of this book conversion is really poor.Issues include:- bad paragraph breaks- OCR failures- missing paragraphs- chapters not configured as bookmarks (personal peeve)You might get the impression that the publisher did not take the time to read through the converted document.On the whole I found that the frequency of the errors was so high that it really did impact on the enjoyability of what was an otherwise very interesting and informative read."
3,Inside Job: good but incomplete,"""Inside Job"" is a nice piece of work but it gives a complete and wholly undeserved ""pass"" to the US Congress for its failure to act to prevent the financial crisis we are still living today. Congress is supposed to regulate the regulators, but was snoozing at the switch ... if you give it the benefit of the doubt."
3,The rubble handle is disintegrating...,"I've had this knife and a larger sibling for for over a year now. The balance is great, it holds an edge well, and it's totally machine washable (which my Henkels knives are not because their aluminum rivets are dissolving in my local water).So, I oughta adore the knives, but I can't because their rubber handles are starting to turning sticky and leave black smears on my hands. Maybe they aren't really dishwasher-safe. I used to like it a lot, I don't like it now.So: nice knife, undone by a durability issue.Update: raised to from 2 to 3 stars since I shoulda realized this was another annoying ""Hand wash with warm, soapy water and promptly dry"" item."
3,overrated knife with a comfortable handle,"Length:: 1:07 MinsPros:1. comfortable handle2. great designCons:1. could have been a lot sharper.2. have to exert too much force to pare an apple.This knife has only been used to pare about 20 apples and about 20 carrots, and is less than a week old."
4,Sterling,Great source of information...recommend for any real fan of the Twilight Zone....gives background of a life that has interested Americans for decades...a page turner to be sure...
2,Okay,"There is a lot of good info in here. It's a fairly interesting book if you're a Rod Serling fan. It just suffers from a common ailment among biographies: It's insulting to its subject. It seems heavily weighted toward showing Serling's negative aspects and weaknesses. Also, the sections on the Twilight Zone and Night Gallery seemed rather terse, considering those were his two biggest shows. Too bad Serling never wrote an autobiography."
5,Does what is's s'pose to,"Arrived on time, well packaged, does the job. What can I say? There's not much to it but i like it."
4,Worth its expensive price,"This book is 171 pages long and only the first 100 pages are worthwhile. Despite its dimunitive size and exborbitant price, this book is worth a purchase.The book gives leadership knowledge derived from the academia, the battlefield, and fine examples. Its values comes from its simplicity.1)Be: Leadership is about character. It is not a pretense. Honesty, discipline, and duty are paramount for a leader.2)Know: Every leader must be knowledgeable not only about their job, but everyday things. Since knowledge enables, a leader must be highly knowledgeable.3)Do: Leader must put their skills to a good use.Why only 4 stars? The book assumes the Army is the perfect organization. It is good to have strong sense of pride in your organization, but pretending your organization flawless is somewhat antithesis of good leadership."
3,An interesting book,"I found this book a very interesting read. I picked up this book to gain insight into the current interviewing practices I may face in a potential job search. As a consequence, I was not the target audience for this book. Still, the author kept me engaged, and provided useful examples of how interviews can be utilized to bring more information to the interviewer. Turning it around, the same skill allows the interviewee to gain additional and useful information from the interviewer. In both cases, if used, these behavioral interviewing techniques are bound to garner a better fit between the employee and the employer at the end of the day.Keith"
3,"A little slow, but okay...","This is a three-episode arc of a serial television melodrama/teen soap. As such, it wasn't going to be ""tidy"" as a video release. Those looking for Kevin Smith/Jay & Silent Bob won't be disappointed--but he's definitely created a character for himself here. Smith's relationship with one of the Degrassi mothers (ignoring the fact that he is in fact married in real life, and is playing himself) overwhelms most of his camera time, and as a non-regular watcher of the show, I have to wonder how badly this little subplot derailed an ongoing story where that woman seemed to be happily engaged going into these episodes.All in all, it's a fun diversion, a great chance to see Smith make fun of himself and have fun with these characters at a time when ""Clerks II"" wasn't yet a glint in the eye of the moviegoing public and there was no clear sense of whether or not Jay and Bob would ever be back."
2,I knew there had to be something wrong with this DVD!,"I received this DVD from my brother who is possibly a bigger Kevin Smith fan than I am. I thought the fact that he was giving away his copy was pretty odd at the time until I watched the DVD myself.The Degrassi episodes are amazingly boring and Jay and Silent Bob's toned-down appearances don't help much. I really liked the original Degrassi series so I was disappointed by this DVD.There are some funny moments in the ""Extras"" section of the DVD but I would still only recommend this as a ""rent"" or something to buy used if you are a diehard fan."
2,Unexpected,"Jay and Silent Bob Do Degrassi The Next Generation (Unrated)I wish I had read the reviews before purchasing this DVD. I saw Jay and Silent Bob and expected something more like Clerks. I was willing to give it a chance however. Unfortunately, 20 minutes in was more than enough for me. The ""after school special"" quality of the show was way to much to endure while waiting for an occasional spot from Kevin Smith or Jason Mewes. Being a fan, it's hard to give this a bad review, but I guess you can't make everyone happy all the time."
5,Degrassi & Bob! YES!,I have to say I was already a big fan of the original Degrassi and really had little to know ideal about the Neaxt generation. I feel this was a great way to introduce me the new generation. Jay an Bob decide to film one of their movies at Degrassi well you can figure out the rest. IT a silly film that brings some new and old members togethor.I liked this film because Kevin Smith like me is a big fan of the show and it help me introduce the new cast to someone who had no ideal what was going on. Its typical Degrassi but with a Kevin Smith Twist. Its a must for any Degrassi fan. Im glad I did now I have to catch up on the Next Generation. So should you.
3,Meh,"I remember a reference to Degrassi from something else involving Kevin Smith so when I saw this I thought it would be really cool. I had a hard time trying to figure out what exactly was going on. It was like The OC meats Saved by the Bell (The New Class) meets Jay and Silent Bob. There was so much teenage drama I felt it was just exaggerated. Keven Smith is only in the first episode for about 5 min. The other two episodes have Jason acting like Jay hitting on HS girls, although I have heard Jason/Jay are totally different personalities.I never really got into the Degrassi series although I tried to enjoy the regular tv show. I think I am just too old to appreciate it now, although I still like the Saved by the Bell series that I grew up watching.If it was Jay and Silent Bob do Bayside High this movie would have been 5 stars for sure... cause the Degrassi crew is a bunch of clown shoes."
1,Disappointing!,"Being a big Degrassi and Jay/Silent Bob fan, I was looking forward to this! But I was severely let down! It is bad! It's not the Jay & Silent Bob that we love! I am warning you now - don't buy it for full price! I've already sold my copy on ebay to some poor unsuspecting sod who (like me) probably has high expectations."
3,Not what I expected at all.,"This is deffinately a Degrassi DVD more than a Jay and Silent Bob DVD. I don't really understand why it is ""Uncut"" because it is really tame.I have never watched Degrassi before but Was a big fan of Degrassi Jr. High as a kid so it was cool to see that some of the old kids are in the show and all grown up.Although this is really a soap opera for a teen/preteen audiance,it was watchable and I am giving it an extra star for nostalgia."
3,Not What I thought it would be.,"Don't be fooled into thinking that this is the next Jay & Silent Bob movie. This is actually just a couple of episodes of Degrassi: The Next Generation featuring Kevin Smith and Jason Mewes. Fortunately, I like Degrassi and as a TV series it's not that bad, it's more young teen situations and less off the wall adult humor that I was expecting."
2,What's Degrassi?,"It's this simple. If you've never seen an episode of Degrassi, even by accident, you will be very disappointed with this DVD. The Jay & Silent Bob sections are really funny. They fight Canadian ninjas. Nice. But the 1:14 run time could have, should have, had the Degrassi parts edited out as a bonus feature. It's like reading three chapters out of a book. There may be some interesting parts in what you read, but you're just not going to understand the story. Not worth the time invested. And the explicit language is only in the extras section. Shame on you Kevin Smith. Shame on you."
1,Jersey Girl is better.......,"......and that is not a compliment for Jersey Girl! I am a Kevin Smith lapdog and borderline Degrassi obsessive. However, I found the Jay and Silent Bob/Degrassi arc difficult to watch. Kevin Smith's portrayal of Kevin Smith was creepy and made me queasy. In acting, the more silent Kevin Smith is, the better."
4,Unfamiliar with Degrassi,"I'll be the first to admit, I saw ""Jay and Silent Bob"" and bought the disc, however I didn't really know much about Degrassi the next generation. But it's OK, because the disc is pretty self explanitory when it comes to stories from other episodes that were carried over. One thing You'll have to keep in mind is that this was just a guest spot by Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith on 3 episodes, the episodes were about Kevin Smith wanting to shoot his new Jay and Silent bob movie there(in Canada). One thing i didn't like was how Kevin kept throwing in anti Bush jabs into the show. I'm not a Bush supporter, but Bush bashing really had no place in this show.As for the show(s), they were very entertaining. I could definetly see getting into this show on a regular basis, even if it was a little Cheezey."
4,Silly but fun,"This is great for me because I am a big Degrassi and Kevin Smith fan. But, if you are looking at this because you loved Clerks, skip it. It's not really representative of Smith's other work. If you can pick up cheap (like I did) it still might be worth taking a look at."
1,What were they thinking??,"Sorry Kevin Smith but stick to your proven formula, this one really sucked. Very disappointed. I have NO idea what you were thinking? Missing high school are we? Its kind of like Dawsons Creek with Jay n Silent bob in it for those of you in the US. What a wierd premise and it does not work."
1,Not the item shown or described.,"When I ordered this, I expected either a) the sheath for the Cold Steel Delta Dart ( which is what I wanted ) or perhaps the Delta Dart AND Sheath.What I got was the Cold Steel Delta Dart WITHOUT the sheath. When I contacted the seller ( whom are very nice people, and very helpful ) theywere sorry, and said that they would change the description for the item on Amazon, but they did not carry the sheath, only the delta dart. Theyoffered to cover the cost of the item AND shipping ( As I said, they are very nice people ).That said, this item is not what it says, please contact the seller prior to purchasing."
3,Speedy shipping,"The sheath is a necessity to the dart, so I would encourage you read the product description carefully. I am surprised that the chain feels more durable than I expected, but the sheath and chain should be sold together with the dart. Why is the sheath more expensive than the actual dart? I also received the sheaths before the darts, though it was ordered all at once."
3,Some great hits,"Hit me with your best shot and 867-5309 are obvious greats, but the cd is definitly missing other important 80's flavor."
3,It was okay,"The movie over-all was okay, but the technical aspects is lacking. YOu can't see the characters clearly, but Fred Williamson does a great job and when it was originally made, it was relevant, but unless you're an older, black man, dedicated to the 70's blaxexploitation-type films, you probably won't like this, but I did."
5,Listen to the words,"This is my all-time favorite CD. If you are feeling down on yourself, listen to every word of this concert. If you are feeling like praising the Lord for his mercy, listen to every word of this concert. If you just like good music and good stories, listen to every word of this concert. I'm a Southern Gospel fan, and the guitar/piano music meets my high standard for not sounding like the worldly music so prevelant in ""Christian"" rock. My favorite part of the concert is the dialog. The songs you can get on other CD. If there were 6 stars on the rating system, I'd give it that."
1,Great Book!,This book if full of facts and information on Canadian Prisons!!!It's a good buy for anyone interested in the justice field!
3,A Glimpse of 80s Aussie music,"Nice collection of songs that is really easy to listen to. There are 5 Men At Work cuts on this CD: Who Can It Be Now, Down Under, Dr. Heckyll & Mr. Jive, Overkill, and Looking For Jack, which is a Colin Hay solo tune.There are also tracks by Tim Finn of Crowded House, Flash & The Pan, Split Enz, etc.I was lucky enough to find this on Ebay for 5 bucks. I also found out there are TWO VERSIONS of this CD. The 1st Pressing included a ""Bonus CD"" which has 4 extra tracks, none of them being Men At Work cuts. Subsequent editions just have the 1 CD.Overall, a rare out-of-print collection that any Men At Work fan should have, just to see far ahead of their local peers they were."
2,Makes your nails shiny but very hard to remove,"This nail polish has no odor which is great and it looks very nice and is easy to apply. French Pink looks clear and shiny. I could barely see any pink at all. It didn't last as long as regular nail polish, about three days at best, but oddly it is very hard to remove. I had to scrape off what didn't peel off naturally. I also used nail polish remover three times and can still see some shiny spots. It seemed to dry out my nails a lot. I wouldn't buy it again."
1,worst water-based polish on the market,"I hated this polish. I tried it after going to an organic salon in Philadelphia (the first organic spa in the US!). As the spa suggested, I waited 8 hours to wash my hands or get water on them. The polish came off the next morning in the shower and made a HUGE mess. I'm staying away from water based polishes unless the brand that the spa uses (the next time I'm in Philly). Yikes! I can't believe I paid good money for this polish. It's streaky as well."
4,watch winder,everything was the way I would expect. It arived on time and in good condition.I would recomend this to anyone.
5,Works and is Quiet,"I've never owned a watch winder before. This one works great and keeps my Tag Heuer winded just fine. It's easy to use. I keep it in my bedroom and it's very quiet. If it's very quiet in the room, I can just barely hear the watch winder, and only when it's actually turning. I love it."
1,A piece of junk!,"Have tried this winder with 3 of my automatic watches - all stopped running after a few days on this ""winder"" - only to run well again once I wore them or placed the watches on one of my other winders. I changed the batteries on this unit but had the same result. What a disappointment. I would give it ""0"" stars except the box has a pretty finish to it - maybe I can use as a nice display case for a QUARTZ watch! Definitely would NOT recommend it!!"
2,you get what you pay for,"the 1st time i put it on my dog, the Velcro broke in 3 places... i held it together with safety pins... but disappointing"
3,Cute idea- not for my dog.,I bought this costume hoping it would be something that looked cute but was out of my dog's way. He weighs 7lbs so I opted for the small. I'm not sure if it was too small or what...the buns looked more like wings and he kept trying to eat them.Customer service was very good and they took the return easily. I would go back to this vendor.
2,Hot Dog Costume - Small,The quality of this costume wasn't the greatest. The straps to hold the costume on were not long enough to get a secure fit.
3,Didn't stay on very well...,This costume is interesting. It is pretty flimzy across the back. It just straps under the tummy. We couldn't get it to stay on our dog.
2,Runs small,I measured my dog and ordered the medium based on what the advertisement said. It is way too small. I will have to extend the straps. It won't even go around her belly and she's a skinny little girl.I would send it back but the postage would cost more than the sale price of the costume!
1,my dog pulled the stuffing out of bun in <2 mins,I got it on my mini dachshund and he immediately went for the bun. The stitching is SOO weak.. I didn't expect this costume to hold up more than one day with my dog but seriously this costume is so fragile. I wouldn't buy anything from this co. if it requires stitching. It will fall apart in a min
2,weiner dog costume,Cute costume... size seems to be humungus for my med size weiner dog! Tried the sz small and it was wayyyy to small. Sizing on this costume seems off.
1,Sewing was to be desired.....,"A terribly sewn item. It was broken when arrived, seams were breaking apart. Sizing was totally off from website to the actual product when it arrived."
1,Horrible quality!,"I just received my order, and I have to say I am very disappointed in this product. I actually have to sew one of the Velcro straps on, because it is not even attached! The over - all sewing on this product is horrible. I will not be ordering from your company again, and will not recommend you."
5,Second place winner!,"This was a great costume! It was easy to put on and my dog didn't seem to mind wearing it. It works better with a collar than a harness. The harness/leash get a little tangled up in the costume. Also, the costume would probably look a little better on a dark colored dog...ours is white. Still, we entered our home town pet parade...I was a a ketchup bottle, must husband was a mustard bottle and of course our dog was a hotdog. We got so many compliments and we even won second place!"
1,not a hot dog,"supper cheap material, the catsup part of the costume came apart just by trying on and walking around"
5,Hot Dog costume!,"Great quality costume, very reasonable price and deliver quickly. I will definitely use them again!"
5,cute costume,My little brown poodle Muddy looks adorable in this costume. He and I both like it because it doesn't cover his face and it's easy to put on. He gets a lot of attention when he wears it.
3,Very Cute But My Puppy Hated It :(,It was hilarious but he couldn't really walk in it and it didn't stay in place very well. I don't regret buying it because i didn't spend much but I probably should have done something a little less cumbersome.
4,Cute costume,Bought this for my italian greyhound... he did not think it was very amusing. I must admit I would rather have had a costume that was a little warmer for October.
4,Very poorly made,"This has to be one of the WORST hot dog costumes ever! It was VERY poorly made and I had to sew it back together several times,"
1,This was a poorly manufactured product,"I received the item and found it to be poorly manufactured. The stitching was not good, and appeared to be coming apart. Basing the fit on the manufacturer specifications, I placed the order and still found the product to be too large for my dog. There are black straps stitched that actually start to become undone and start to unravel, when you attempt to secure your dog inside the costume firmly. I would have liked a more detailed description of how to size your dog. I would have also liked more detailed product specifications."
4,Supper funny and cute custome!,"Ok... I know that it's not the best quality in the world, but it's very very funny and the price is just fare for the product.My dog loved it, the straps that hold the ketchup and the buns together was badly put together, but I fixed this by integrating both buns and the ketchup to the chest piece I had for walking my dog!This way I got a really funny Halloween custome for my dog, at a low price. Again, I know is not perfect, but it's not ment to be.I ratter pay 15$ for a shaky custome, because it's not for daily use! than having it really well made, but at a higher price.Either way, the choice is yours, I like it."
3,"cheap quality, too small for my mini dachshund","The quality is definitely cheap, but I expected that. It didn't break after using it so that's good.My main gripe is that this ""small"" sized costume was TOO small for my mini dachshund puppy of 4 months. Wow! Should've gotten a medium. Maybe they should make the labels more clear because you would think that a 7 lbs mini would be considered a small dog."
3,Dog gone cute,"This costume is adorable, but not practical. It doesn't really stay on the dog and slid all over the place eventually ending up around the hind quarters area. For the price, it was good for a one time couple of photos though.It came really quick!"
4,"Cute costume, measure before you buy",I almost bought the medium in this costume for my dog who is very long for her mix. Luckily I measured her and the Large fits her perfectly. She weighs 16 pounds and I included a picture of her in the costume. I had to sew the costume like another person who bought this. The sides were hanging a little too low so I sewed the buns to the four black straps so it fit snugger. Very cute costume just watch the size.
4,better quality than expected,The covers arrived sooner than expected. They are slightly heavier than the last set I had and the pattern is very pretty.Better quality than expected.
4,The Greatest Book Ever Written,The book was in good condition. The arrival of the book was done within the specified time line.
3,Accounting review,"This book isn't anything special compared to other Auditing textbooks. Like most, this book falls short in helping the student develop investigational skills needed in auditing and accounting practice in general. There are too many time consuming practice problems that leave the student wondering what they actually learned for all the work they had to do on the problem."
1,Daily Reader???,"I have just purchased this "" daily ""reading book to find that the relevant daily dates were left off each page and making it even worse is each day just runs into the next without any paragraph or page break . Having had the hardcover for a number of years I will be returning to it. There is a total lack of understanding shown by the person transcribing this book for Kindle as to why this book is used by most readers. Hint: Every DAY reading, one page a day!! Perhaps its because I'm using Kindle on an iPad but I doubt it. Like most things electronic it needs an upgrade. LoL"
5,Inspirational,I ran across allot of John Maxwell's work while doing resreach in graudate school. I have found his insight and advice inspiring and helpful. Leadership Promises is no different. This is a must have daily meditation for anyone striving to lead and achieve spiritual balance.
4,Book buy,"The book was in great condition and arrived in a timely manor. It had a little writing in it, but what do you expect from a used book?"
5,"perfect devotional for anyone who parents, mentors, or leads","I bought a copy of this book many years ago during a time in my previous marriage when I was receiving conflicting, but well intended advice. At that time, I needed to spend time learning God's ideal of a person of integrity. What I ended up with was a wonderful devotional that changed how I parent, how I work for my employer, how I mentor young adults. No other business leadership manuscript impacted my growth as this small book. I purchase it often as gifts for graduation and other milestone events. I handed my scribbled and notated book over to my daughter when she left for college...it is now one of her favorites."
5,Maxwell Leadership Bible,Outstanding book with great daily messages. This is the second copy I've bought. I gave my first copy to my son who loves the book as well.
1,Worthless edition of a good book,"The first thing I noticed is that the table of contents wasn't live. In a public domain book selling for $4 I expect that in the formatting. Second, there are no illustrations at all. The original available for free from several places on the web has all of the illustrations.ElaineNorman, Oklahoma"
1,Useless without illustrations,The Kindle edition is useless because it's missing the illustrations. The entire point of this book is to illustrate how various filling stitches are used in Jacobean motifs.
1,Only one semi usuable bag,2 out of my 3 bags had some black sticky substance on the inside of the bag and I did not feel comfortable putting my food inside them. The 3rd bag was split but I did manage to use it. I will not purchase this again.
1,Stick with Savu !,Just purchased the Alder bags and what a mess ! They literally came apart at the seams. I have been a Savu Smoker bag user for many years and have never had a problem. The Cameron bags are not as sturdy and I will never purchase them again.
2,Smokeless Bags,"They were easy to use and clean up was easy, however, they didn't infuse the smoke flavor I was hoping they would... Stick with the actual smoker!"
3,Just ok,The alder are the best of the smoker bags but it also does not impart much flavor mostly just smells up your place.
3,STEINBECK WOULD NOT BE HAPPY,"Other reviewers have pretty much discussed how it varies from the actual book, and how Hollywood had decided to give the flick a happy ending and making everyone feel good after gnawing away on popcorn and candy bars. It has to be one of highly acclaimed Harris' worst movies. However, on a parting note, the scenery and photography were okay, but I believe Steinbeck is wondering 'what the hell happened?' but I'm sure that is a common concern among authors when their books are made into movies."
2,movie not entirely true to book...,"The movie itself was not entirely true to the book, which was disappointing since I'm currently teaching it to my Special Ed high school class. This version would confuse them more than help them, I think. The seller, however, was very helpful and sent it to me in a timely manner. Thanks to them."
3,The Pearl video,"I was amzed at how rapidly the video was sent to me. Just a matter of days. Thank you very much!The video is beautifully filmed. The opening is very important and reflects the atmosphere of the story in Baja, California (which is in Mexico). The colours , the straw houses, the fish, the village, the neighbours' proximity to each other.There are differences in the book and the film. Some I like. Some I don't.I am using it as a teaching tool and my students like this film (and book) very much."
2,What ever happened to political correctness?,"I teach the novella -- The Pearl. I bought this movie to show my students. I had high hopes, but this movie departed from the events of the novel in a serious way, was badly acted, and literally had actors in ""face paint"" portraying Hispanic people. I wish I hadn't wasted my money on it."
2,Rated PG-13 not (not rated),"I am a junior high English teacher and I ordered this movie after reading the book with my students. I saw that it was not rated and so I thought it would be fine. Once I received it, I see the rating is PG-13. There is some violence and a few sexually suggestive scenes. So be aware if your intended use is for students."
1,Horrible,"I made it through a whole 15 minutes of this movie before turning it off. What a horrible adaptation of a truly great story. The acting was horrible and I don't think they had a casting director. It looked like they walked out into the street and said, ""you, you and you - no acting required."" I could not sit through this movie and watch them murder one of my favorite stories. Bypass this one and please, please, don't show this in class - you will kill any child's desire to ever read Steinbeck!"
2,Not worth watching,"I read John Steinbeck's novel with my class of tenth graders and then decided to show them the film version. I wanted them to pay attention to the differences between the book and movie since there are always some. However, it turns out that there are more differences than there are similarities. It was as if they wrote a whole new story line, and I didn't see the purpose of doing so. If you plan on showing this movie in conjunction with the book: don't. Maybe the movie is alright on its own...hard to say since I read the book and it paled in comparison."
2,The Pearl DVD,This movie was interesting in so far as it brought to life Steinbeck's book but it deviated too many times from the story by adding things and changing the ending. The acting was terrible and the characters were unbelievable. Surely they could have found some Mexican actors to play the parts. I think they were trying to whitewash the story for the benefit of younger viewers.
1,What happened?,"I bought this to share with my students, but it is SUCH a bad movie, I could not bring myself to show it. Reading the book, full of subtleties and nuances, is a million times better. Hard to do in a movie and this particular production doesn't even try. The doctor as the villain? Come on!"
3,OK Hollywood Version of The Pearl,"This film version of The Pearl is nicely done, however they did change the story somewhat. The original story is quite short, so I suppose it made sense to beef it up a bit. It was enjoyable, but not what I expected."
2,The Pearl,"This movie is based on the book by John Steinbeck. This DVD follows the book pretty closely, and I use it after I read the book with my 8th grade students. If you are watching the movie for pleasure, it's not that great!"
1,Sincere apologies to John Steinbeck!,"There is no way you can ever compare this d-grade movie to one of the best classics ever, Steinbeck's The Pearl. For one, Kino, as a young boy starts out ""white"", then grown up, he becomes Mexican/Indian with a bad looking tan. The actors are all white, with tanned makeup, the language is way off-key, without a hint of true accent. The plot is not memorable, nor sincere to the book. But for the whitewashing of Hollywood, ironically, the Director is Mexican. What happened there??!!If you have read this wonderful book, you can see that watching this movie is no reflection. And it is easy to understand that the ""book version"" of many movies doesn't compare, but this is simply a different story. Don't even try it. Steinbeck would not only turn over in his grave, he would jump out!! .....Rizzo"
1,Terrible,"Just saw this in the theatre...what a waste of good money! Except for Richard Harris the acting was terrible, the actors are horribly miscast...an altogether forgettable experience."
5,same but different,"This album is the same as ""tour de force"" and ""the best of gil scott-heron live"" minus the lengthy version of angel dust and some of Gil's trademark banter and jokes. I find it very strange that all three different albums came out with the same tracks in the same year. with that all being said this is absolutely the cleanest and highest fidelity release of these tracks. if you already own tour de force or the best of gil scott-heron live i wouldn't get this unless for the completest (which is me:) aspect. this is a quality product though."
3,Maserful Voice,"Having read this work in January 1992, I found the poet writing with a distinctly masterful voice, but there was nothing memorable or powerful or insightful in the poetry beside the voice, I'm sorry to say. A line or two, here or there, yes, but never anything that had the ability to touch me as I hoped, expected, wanted. ""Transcendental Etude"" was like that. Oracular sounds void of substance."
2,"Good on Theory, Weak on Practical Aspects","The book presents translation theory and information on the history of translation. It lists proverbs with their translations as well as cognates and false cognates. There's humorous examples of bad translations. Therefore, after reading it, you will know how to evaluate the quality of a translation without having been given much practice in translating. If you're looking for a book on translation theory, this will be a fine introduction. It isn't as good if you need to learn to translate."
4,Cumulative Record of Speech Skills Acquisition,"This item was in excellent condition, with no writing or pages torn out. It can be very useful in documenting speech skills progress. It is quite long, and for use by personnel trained in auditory-verbal theory. Too bad that it is out of print because it could be helpful for the increasing number of people with cochlear implants."
1,"Bad book, very bad book","This book is so full of errors it is unbelieveable that it is a seventh edition. Examples are non existant in relation to problem assignments. Those that are given are full of errors either from the author or the typesetter. The solution manual IN ADDITION to this text are required to get any sort of learning from it. It is definately not worth the price that the publisher sets. If you are looking for a text for a college class, look somewhere else."
1,This book stinks.,"As a student of mechanical engineering technology at a state college, I am used to using inferior study materials and dealing with incompetent professors. If that isn't enough, I think this book insults me. I would no sooner spend $100.00 on this book than use a stack of 100 $1.00 bills to fix the broken leg on my coffee table. As a tip, look to earlier additions of this book where the term ""CD rom"" is never mentioned."
1,Book is in need of editing.,"The above was assigned as a text book in a college course. After spending many hours and staring at formulas that did not make any sense, we found out that the book is full of fundamental errors (this fact was confirmed by my Professor). The impression I got from the publisher and the author was that this book has been written for the soul purpose of revenue generation and not for educational purposes. I think the author needs to edit the book one more time (I have the Seventh edition)."
1,Avoid if you can.,"If there were ever a textbook to avoid, this is the one. I've never actually hated a book, but this one makes my head hurt every time I have use it. Like other reviewers have noted, it's very vague, the example problems leave a lot to be desired, and there are errors throughout the book. By far, it is not an easy book to read, and even after re-reading chapters there are still parts that do not make sense.I have had to use this book for two machine element courses, and both professors admitted this book is not very good and we'd be better off using Mott's Machine Elements book."
2,2-1/2 stars for a very average book (at best),"I used this book for my ME courses 20+ years ago (6th edition). It was OK, i.e., very average, period. Several years into my engineering career, I purchased a used copy of Shigley's Mechanical Engineering Design. My copy of Spott's text (the author must be about 118 years old by now) now gathers dust and pigeon excrement. Shigley's text is a much superior reference for machine elements and machine design applications. What saved us in undergrad was the use of the Schaum's outline, Machine Design, which has excellent examples and fills in a lot of gaps. I have also used the Schaum's outline on several projects."
3,"I, Tanner","Like the previous Deathlands title: ""Homeward Bound"" delved into details of Ryan Cawdor's life, ""Dark Emblem"" dives into the details of Doctor Theopolis Algeron Tanner in flashbacks. We learn the events that happened as Doc was time trawled forward from the 1860's to the year 1999 by the team of scientist for the Totality Concept. One scientist being Dr. Silas Jamaisvous. We learn about the torture that went through Doc Tanner's mind has he is thrusted into a world completely different than his own. Then taken from this new worlds and thrusted again into the future that is known as Deathlands. Dark Emblem answers many questions on why Doc is what he is. What the book lacks in action it makes up for in an explorative story of an integral main character."
3,James Axler Is a decent write but needs some work,"I've read about three or four novels in the Deathlands series now, and while his writing style is decent, I've found him lacking in his knowledge of Weapons. A Prime example of this would be that in a short scene in the Dark Emblem, Doc Tanner grabs a GLOCK handgun off of his unconcious captor, in the next scene, Doc is described as putting the gun down the front of his pants for safe keeping and makes sure the SAFETY is on.Glocks do not have a safety that can be turned on and off. Glock Firearms come equipped with a safety built into the Trigger, this is a totally unique design and is one reason of many reasons why the Glock is so popular.Also, The Sig-Sauer that Ryan Cawdor Uses, the 9MM with built in Baffled Silencer, doesn't exist.I feel if James Axler is going to use real life weapons in his book, he should think about doing some research on them."
3,A good story with little action.,"This was not a bad story, but not one of the best in the Deathlands saga. There was too little action and not enough survival settings that marks this series as such. But the story was good but I know enough about Doc Tanner to make me puke. Get on with the action/adventure and muties!"
5,a great kit for your sunny travel getaways,"The bag is big enough to store a lot of your smaller make-up and travel sized beauty items, and the products inlcuded were great they worked well with my oily prone skin."
3,"Quality Product, Poor quality control","I received in Sept 2011 and didn't install until Nov 12, 2011 after I installed my new shower. By then the return/exchange window was closed. I had the same problem as the Feb 2 review. ""it will not shut off the water completely to the fixed shower head"". I decided to take a better look at it and disassembled it (very easy for me to do), it was manufactured wrong. The flat where the knob set screw goes was 90 off, therefore it wouldn't seal properly. I filed a new flat in the correct place (that piece is some sort of plastic, very easy to file) and reassembled (total replace/repair time about a hour). I put it back in place and it is now working like it should and I really don't expect it to fail.5 Stars for the quality (mostly brass & solid, not plastic) and 1 Star for the quality control (it should never have been shipped) = 3 Stars"
5,"Great 2 way Diverter - solid construction, easy operation","Solid, sturdy metal, easy to operate lever.Pay attention though, this is a 2 WAY diverter, NOT a 3 way. I wanted a 3 way diverter, got this one instead. If you put the lever half-way in-between, you get 2 half-off flows, not 2 'on' flows. But for what it is, it's great!"
1,Poor Quality,"The item did not work as advertised - in one position the water was blocked altogether, in the second postion, water went to both the shower head and hand shower. It also leaked (squirted water) past the lever."
4,It was a good purchase for our daughter,"My dad wanted to buy my six-year-old daughter a digital camera for her birthday. It was hard finding one under $100 that actually worked well. From the reviews we chose this camera. It is very easy for our daughter to use. She takes great pictures and can see them right away. The camera memory only hold 18 or so pictures. She can plug it right into our TV to see the pictures big. So far, we have not been able to get the software to bring the pictures up on the computer from our camera. We don't know if that's not possible with our 1998 computer or if we're doing it wrong. We haven't taken a whole lot of time to figure it out yet or contacted the company."
3,Incorrect discription of product,"We chose this camera for our kids specifically because the description of the product on Amazon.com said that it had rechargeable batteries. We are quite tired of consuming piles of AAA batteries for the kids' mp3 players, cameras, toys, etc. So a camera that came with rechargeable batteries - particularly one that charged them via the USB interface - sounded mighty attractive.Imagine our disappointment when we opened the box and found that it contained 2 AAA Alkaline batteries - clearly labeled ""Not Rechargeable!"" The (rather skimpy) user's manual makes absolutely no mention of battery charging at all either.The trouble is that the camera was our kid's Birthday present; it would be heartbreaking to take it back and return it to Amazon. So we have basically been duped by Amazon.Not impressed."
4,Cheers to a hit sitcom's third season!,"In Cheers' third season,there are 7 cast members. Kelsey Grammer has joined the cast as Dr. Frasier Crane,a psycologist who Diane Chambers(Shelley Long) is romantically involved with. Diane and Sam(Ted Danson) were no longer a couple,at least not at this time. At this time,Nicholas Colasanto who is Nick ""Coach"" Pantusso,became terminally ill and passed away in early 1985 at age 61. Grammer remained on the series thru its 1993 cancellation,thus being(his character) spun-off on Frasier. Frasier premiered immediately after the cancellation of Cheers and in fact,the spin-off itself has just been cancelled after 11 seasons. Grammer portrayed his character for 20 years! Way to go,Kelsey!!! That's eight years more than the late Carroll O'Connor's character Archie Bunker on CBS's All In The Family and Archie Bunker's Place."
5,"funny, funny, funny","Cheers has one of the funniest casts of all sitcoms. In most sitcoms there is at least one character that you just dispise but it Cheers the whole cast is perfect, amazing casting. Carla is hilarious with her witty remarks and insults and I love coach with his amazing comedic perfomance, to bad it was his last season. I love this show and everthing about it."
5,The Best!,"Cheers is phenomenal, and the greatest show ever. Great acting and writing make Cheers top notch. Too bad Nicholas Colasanto died at the third season. Coach was great. Cheers is my favorite show of all time, and if you by the third season, you'll find out why."
3,Nothing new,"I have read Fodor's books in the past and found them to be more informative than this book on Aruba. Not many travel books on Aruba exist so that's why I chose this one. However, it did not really contain any so-called ""secrets"" that I hadn't already found out from surfing on the internet.There were some things that I liked about this book. It would probably be a good source if you are not an avid internet surfer (like myself who reads every website that I can find on Aruba). If you did not have any previous knowledge & wanted a short, quick book to just give the basics, then this book is probably for you. If you want a small guidebook to carry along on your trip (like I do) then it's worth the price.But if you want a comprehensive guide with some ""secrets"", pass on this one."
2,Slim Pickins on Aruba Books for Info,"I've been to Aruba twice in 2 years, and it is REALLY difficult finding any type of a resource manual for the island, so I was happy when this one came out.However, since it came out between my two visits, i was a bit disappointed with several inaccuracies in the book.There is a wealth of good information in this book, but I would definitely not use it to choose accomodations, where I saw the largest amount of inaccuracies.A person may feel a bit upset if they booked a resort based on this book, and found out for example that it did NOT have windsurfing as an inclusive. And a resort would be equally upset in knowing one of it's better attractions were not mentioned at all, and thus could possibly cause them a loss of a sale.It had good descriptions of the beaches, and adequate descriptions of the restaurants. But, by all means find a second opinion regarding accomodations!"
3,what happened?,"To me this seems like the complete opposite of the conscious sizzla everyone loves. Just because he sometimes has a harsh delivery doesnt' mean he has to go into detail about such harsh topics. there are a few okay tracks on it but most of is below his usual standard. When I first heard the song Murderer, i thought there could be no way Sizzla is singing with a guy rapping about ""POP- POP""."
3,so so,"I have mixed feelings about this album. If you like the louder more explicit side of Sizzla this is a good one. If, like me, you admire the more spiritual and sensitive side of Sizzla, this album falls short. There are some positive aspects but criticisms come first.The first track 'murderer' is ironically humurous when one thinks of his songs such as 'explain to almighty' and 'love is all'. The lead track always sets a certain tone for an album, and this one does not suit an irie mood. The title of this cd is somewhat misleading - 'brighter day' is not the first thing I think of when listening to rude boy songs about killing and rough sex.With that off my chest, there are a few exceptional tracks. 'Jah Knows' is my favorite track on this album because of its originality and melody. 'Dig it out' is artistic and uses the same rhythm as the previous mentioned track. 'Live up' and the title track 'brigher day' are both worth taking your time to listen to. The rest of the cd is mediocre at best."
3,"A nice production, with one fatal flaw","This video of Madam Butterfly is commendable in a number of ways. The performances are strong, the staging and set design are good, and the audio and video quality are very good.The fact that there are no subtitles present makes it much less enjoyable for me. I'm familiar with the story but would prefer for there to be English subtitles so that I can follow along closely.Amazon should, for this type of product, clearly indicate if there are subtitles or not in the video."
2,Buyer Beware,"I ordered three of these, but what Amazon shipped was not the rack vent in this picture. What I received had horizontal vents, not vertical vents, as shown.The vents are of very good quality, but they do not match my other ones."
3,Book review,"The book is great. The copy I received however, is a very old copy. It looks nothing like the picture and I thought I had been sent the incorrect one. I am reading it for a school project and just hope that the copy is current with what I need it for."
3,updated details.,"This information was missing on the details section. I called Wenger and received more information. Can't give a true rating of the bag yet.Top load day pack, size 15 1/2 by 12 by 7 3/4Cubic in. 2106 cubic inches,Fabric tan polyspon fabric with leather accentsFeaturesMultiple covered external pockets, Organizer panel inside, Large outer pocketPadded carry handles, Comfort fit shoulder straps, Large internal storage spaceWenger jewled logo"
5,Best of both worlds,"What a neat day pack! Classic old school canvas rucksack charm, combined with modern Wenger quality and water resistance. I have been looking for a pack like this for many years. Probably big enough to carry the lightweight Wenger Bernina sleeping bag and a small two man SwissGear tent."
5,Easy Inspiration,"As only Yogi can do, he brings many tough life issues down to the ground level. This book is a collection of 2-3 page ""truths"" according to Mr. Berra. I was really impressed. The approach is one of facing challenges at the gut level and straight ahead. Don't make things complicated, just do it. A must read for everyone. Thanks, Yogi."
3,Poorly edited,"The number of times the electronic version has the word fired in the text an fi is missing made this pretty suspect. Overall the book was ok, not great but ok. A good read even with the typos"
4,"""one of a kind""","Spring means baseball and memories of classic characters. While he was before my time, Yogi Berra has always been an American personality. His limited formal education did not hold him back, as is evidenced by his many rather homespun stories and anecdotes.I try to alternate serious reading with others that have some light-hearted messages about life. Yogi is a ""one of a kind"" spokesperson and reading this book with all of his amusing statements makes one smile.John HoganHoganHospitality comHospitalityEducators com"
2,A lessor effort,"Since I loved the 1979 album ""GEORGE HARRISON"" so much I waited anxiosly for his next one to come out.When I heard the song ""ALL THOSE YEARS AGO,I loved it too and felt it held promise of a good album to come.Unfortunately I was quite disapointed.Basically this goes on the list of his lessor albums like ""DARK HORSE"" and ""EXTRA TEXTURE""."
3,LITTLE BORING,I got this when it first came out. I played it a lot I'm a big fan a few songs are great few are good the rest are sleepers. I thing had George had enough a this point Like the blood of a clone says it all.
3,competant drivel,"Other than Teardrops, there is not one memorable moment on this record, not one song that stands up to repeated listenings. The production is muddy, the keyboard sounds are horribly dated, and George's voice is weak and thin. Doesn't hold a candle to his previous album, George Harrison. A far cry from his glory days with the Beatles and his early solo output."
2,george could have done better,"this album might be the worse george harrison's album and i'm the number 1 fan, only saved by the phenomenal ""baltimore oriole"", very beautiful minor blues with george unique delicate voice and a warm shining saxophone.you can buy that album just for that song!!"
3,"what is, and what could have been","The synths that people keep complaining about aren't all THAT prominent in my opinion. On four tracks, yes, but they're put to subtle use on the other tracks. Anyway, George's lovely guitar shines through. As 80s recordings go, this one holds up quite well.The disappointing thing here for me is that ""Flying Hour,"" ""Lay His Head,"" and ""Sat Singing"" were not included as bonus tracks. I suspect we'll get them at some later date on some future Harrison compilation, but I'd rather have them now.This is my first time owning SOMEWHERE IN ENGLAND on CD. I notice that ""Unconsciousness Rules"" seems to be about thirty seconds longer here than it was on the vinyl and cassette issue. Was it also a longer version on the original issue of the CD?Key tracks: ""Life Itself,"" ""All Those Years Ago,"" ""That Which I Had Lost"" (<-- nobody ever mentions how fantastic the guitar parts are on this song!),""Hongkong Blues."""
2,No longer fat!,"Besides the fact that this movie stinks, at least Adam Sandler doesn't have to play an average fat guy angry about his life (watch any of his previous movies). He's now a fit average guy angry about his life!"
1,Bad product,"The DVD sent to me had scratches on it, and while watching the movie it would skip and stop the movie. I tried in multiple machines and still the same thing."
2,"Zohan, a waste of time.","I bought this because I like most of Adam Sandler's movies. But this was over the top STUPID! A few laughs, maybe at 50 I am too old for his movies. IT just was a waste of time."
2,Bad Movie!!!,"I am a big fan of Adam Sandler, but this is without a doubt one of his worst movies he's ever done. I recommend you rent before you deside to run out and buy this movie."
4,Good Cast-Funny Movie,"You Don't Mess With the Zohan brings to the screen the story of THE top Israeli counter-terrorist agent who after a lifetime of combat, stages his own death before heading to NYC to start a career as a hair dresser.The movie does not start off all that strong and just when you are about to press STOP it gets a lot better.Adam Sandler, John Turturro, Rob Schneider, Emmanuelle Chriqui (who is simply GORGEOUS!), Lainie Kazan, and the rest of the cast do a great job with their respective performances.The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the humor, and the music are all good.Keep an eye out for cameos by Mariah Carey, John McEnroe, and Star Trek's George Takei in a very un-Sulu role.In short, You Don't Mess With the Zohan is probably not a movie you would want to add to your collection, and though quite silly at times, it will surely put you in a good mood and provide for an evening's entertainment."
2,Poor Transfer Kills It for Me,"YOU DON'T MESS WITH THE ZOHAN is definitely a mixed bag. It has a lot of really funny gags, but also repeats some of the bad ones--over and over!What bothered me the most about this was the Blu-ray transfer. It has a golden haze over the entire film with blacks especially looking very soft. This kind of transfer is NOT what Blu-ray is about. Too many of my standard DVDs look better than ZOHAN!"
3,Stupid but Funny,"A ""Kumbaya"" type of film with a ""Can't we all get along"" theme that has more than a few belly laughs. Opens with some interesting shots presumably of the Middle East terrain, but possibly a convincing illusion created on a Hollywood sound stage.In general, I would say that the Palestinians come out on the short end based on the direction of the satire and the stereotypes. And it was hard to gauge why all of the customers of the Arab-owned hair styling shop were all elderly Jewish women. Anyway, if you've got nothing better to watch and want a few chuckles, this one will definitely fit the bill"
5,don't mess,"I seem to be the opp. of some people. While others think this is one of his junkest films, I find it to be one of the best. It's super funny, like how can you not laugh while watching this film? I don't care for Adam Sandler in general not that my likeing for him would determine how i felt about the movie. Anyway, so he plays a counterterrorist agent who gets tired of all the fighting and wants to instead cut hair. It's more peaceful and no, he's not a fagala or however you spell that funny word. He uses his amazing talents when cutting hair with a little extra for each customer. All the sexaul stuff was sometimes a little too much but watching the action and dancing and other stuff made the film worth it. I really do like this film and it never gets old. If you can't laugh even once while watching, then you must be depressed."
4,Stupid but funny:),Stupid but funny:) So watch it if you want and are in a silly mood.It is not quite as stupid as this Amazon review system.
1,weak at best,"i mistakenly thought an adam sandler/robert smigel/judd apatow movie couldn't be anything less than hilarious.oh how wrong i was.this movie is horrible.between sandlers accent that sounds perplexingly french at times, the endless wire stunts and the lame political undertones i just wanted it to end.the coup de gras was the ending when it got all serious with the whole peace between israel and palestine thing.with mariah carey singing in the background.yeah it really blows."
2,"Full of sheer stupidity,not sandler's best at all","Well, my husband bought this and being a somewhat fan of Adam Sandler I figured I would give it a try. I shouldn't have even bothered. I know it is a comedy but the whole movie is sheer stupidity and a bit crude even though I understand it was the unrated version. I liked Sandler's other movies but this one belongs in the trash."
2,Unimpressive,"Took me about 4 hours total to watch Don't Mess With the Zohan: after the first 45 minutes, I kept falling asleep. I was in the mood for something stupid & brainless, & I certainly got it, but it was great to see Shelley Berman, whose records I grew up listening to. Too bad I didn't know it was him until the credits ran."
4,Kung Funny,"This flick is funny. Its not Blazing Saddles, but I think 4 stars (rated as cornball comedy, not vs. The Godfather) is more than fair. Why I'm really posting the review, however, is because this movie is funny even though the title character is a total bad@$$. I get tired real quick of the hero in screwball comedies being a loser (Ace Ventura 2, for example, Austin Powers to some extent). Zohan is part Captain America (or Captain Israel) and part Waterboy, and for me it works here."
1,Terrible Movie,This is one of the dumbest movies I have ever seen. Adam Sandler sound be ashamed of himself.
1,Don't waste your money!,"In my opinion, this is one of the worst Adam Sandler movies to date. Very few funny lines and most of the storyline was way too far fetched. I thought this would be a good one, he has done many that I am very fond of. I was very disappointed!"
1,Just really bad,"I rarely write reviews, but I saw Zohan had an average of 3 stars and couldn't believe it. It is impossible to get too in depth about my issues with this movie because there are so many. Basically it's unfunny, boring and...really boring. The jokes aren't funny, ie: let's put curry on everything including our eye glasses because that's hilarious. This was simply a very poor movie and before this I enjoyed almost all of Sandler's movies, including Little Nickie. Really do yourself a favor and watch something else."
5,Great movie!!!,"I proudly own this and have seen it at least three times. It really is hysterical. I guess there is an undercurrent in this country of people who hate facing problems in current times, so this movie is going to be a sour treat for that type. It's about bridging gaps between people and does a great job of it. Perhaps it is way ahead of its time. There are remarks about how conflicts in Gaza are not so cut and dry. I agree with that. So people who want to keep on believing what they believe are going to sense this and criticize the movie negatively. Oh to live among the sheltered stupid people."
5,Funny Movie with with a hope for middle east peace,"Wonderful movie filled with sight gags, special effects and creative dialogue. It helps if you are from New York...more if you are Jewish and even more if you are up to date with the Israel-Arab relationship. Sandler is wonderful as an Israeli Super Soldier who tires of the endless fighting and gives it all up to move to NYC and be a hairdresser. The end of the movie sports the theme that maybe there is hope for peace and for Arabs and Israeli's to work together. Amen."
3,"Not as bad as expected, not as good as expected...","The trailers for this movie seemed really funny, but I found it to be very slapstick. It wasn't awful - there were too many sexual references and innuendos for my taste. There were some funny parts. I can't say that I would watch this again if I had the chance."
4,A diffferent Adam Sanders.....works for me,"Love this movie...why...its different from what Adam Sandlers has beenoffering us lately. This super sexed up character done for laughs worksvery good. Good editing, camera movement...funny funny sex stuff...thisman wants to hump all the times...and a kinda funny look at Israel andPalestine situations. Anyway hate it or love it...i think its good.Enjoy...good for a keeper."
1,Rubbish,"This is below slapstick, it's total rubbish. Appeals to the lowest, basest common denominator (and the sexual comedy at the expense of old ladies is crude and offensive)."
2,One sexual innuendo after another,This movie is just one sexual innuendo after another. They went as close as they could while still keeping the PG-13 rating. It is not my sense of humor.
1,Pure Filth,This movie was nothing but filth and without any laughs. The only humorous parts were shown in the advertisement.
3,Meh,"Oh 2.5 to 3 stars. Dumb, zany, oddly funny here and there, but eminently forgettable. Don't pay full price. If you must have it - get it used."
2,Silly Fun!,"Of course this movie is silly. It's supposed to be. It is fun and I loved it. The undertones of all the silliness shows the conflict between Israel and Palestine. And that's the silliest thing of all. A comedians look at ""Can't We All Just Get Along?"""
2,Bad Bad and just Bad,"I think I've said before that I don't like potty humor. Just no. This would have been a decent movie if they hadn't added so many rude gags to it. I guess it's about what I was expecting, it had some funny parts, but mostly it's just trash. Get from the $1 rental or just skip it all together."
1,Gross,"I thought this film was pretty gross. Lots of potty jokes and sexual jokes involving Zohan. I stopped watching when he started working at the beauty parlor and began to do more than hair with the willing clients. It was crude, lewd, and offensive and just plain not funny. I don't mind the occasional crass joke. But there needs to be more going on to make a film funny."
1,Horrific,"I know this movie was intended to be silly, and I like Adam Sandler's silly roles and movies for the most part, but COME ON! This was terrible. There is not one good part about this movie..oh wait..the end credits were a god send! The jokes were overplayed and lame at best and Sandler's accent was horrible, and you are forced to endure the torture for all of those jokes. The only reason I even watched the whole thing through was because we were at the movies on a very crowded night, stuck in between a hundred people and it would have been a huge hassle to try to get out. All in all-huge waste of money."
1,I'd give it zero stars if I could,This is the single worst movie I have ever seen. My whole family watched it & not one of us liked it (not even the teenagers)The humor so was crude & childish it bordered on criminal. If fact I can not believe I lost two hours of my life watching this garbage. I would not have this movie if it was given to me for free. Save your time & money skip this one.
1,This movie is sick,"This movie clearly a ""public toilet grafitti"" type with more and more perversive action as it goes on.I am wandering what was the message that the producers of this movie wanted to give...Canot see any value in it, except for that it is plain crude."
1,Not worth it,"I find the movie childish and rather annoying in the end. The humor is badly done and when it finished, I was sorry to have spent the money to see it.It's not one I'll add to my DVD or Blu Ray library."
2,DON'T mess with the Zohan movie!!!,"I was SO disappointed with this movie!!! I LOVE Adam Sandler, but this movie is just stupid! I won't mess with the story line...It's been written by others already. Adam Sandler is another of those FUNNY guys who got a crappy script. It COULD have been funny...IF they hadn't went SO over board trying to make you laugh. I am sure kids would find this funny, except for all the sexual stuff. I am SO glad I didn't buy this movie. I watched it on t.v. Just my luck that I didn't have the extra money to buy this when it came out. It is bent!! It's just like the movie people did with funny man Jim Carrey, gave him STUPID stuff. They are both VERY FUNNY, but in stupid roles. I DO realize, they (the actors) chose to do these movies, but I wonder if they realize AT THE TIME, of the scripts that they will come out SO STUPID. Makes me angry. DON'T bother buying this movie! Rent it FIRST. Some may find this really funny, not me."
1,"Sad, very Sad","A very sad, sad movie. I am so happy I didn't buy it. So shameful, especially with what happened with hamas and Israel lately. Humor can go so far. When I saw the children stoning Zohan AS IF IT WAS NORMAL!!!! Come on man!!!!"
1,One of the worst Adam Sandle movie,"Usually Adam Sandler movies are predicable, but entertaining enough to finish. But this movie is just an insult to my intelligence. To enjoy the movie, I had to be a 5 year old, but some of the ""humor"" is for adults only. His movies such as waterboy, 50 1st dates, etc, have a lot of dumb but fun jokes. This movie lacked those jokes, the humor in this movie is just plain dumb, not funny at all.Avoid buying, at most rent it if you must watch all Adam Sandler movies."
2,Worth the 99 cent rental but no more.,Very surprised that this movie was soo poorly done. Rented it for 99 cents but it was barely worth that much.
1,Worst. Movie. Ever.,"Not sure what's going on with Adam Sandler these days. It seems as if whatever freshness he brought to the tasble early on is gone. Now, its as if he's pursuing what he thinks is comedy. This wasn't justa bad Sandler movie, it was a bad movie period."
1,A Big Swing And A Miss,"Adam Sandler is like a nearly washed-up pro baseball slugger; he either hits one out of the ballpark or looks absolutely ridiculous striking out on three curve balls in the dirt. This one is the latter.With bits that oftentimes give a wink and a nod to old Saturday Night Live skits and a heavy dose of unsettling sexual ""humor,"" this ultimately proves to be a very weak attempt by Sandler to deliver a comedic twist on the Arab-Israeli conflict.Die-hard fans will enjoy the breeze from the swings, but Sandler fails miserably in the clutch."
3,Felt like a Low-fi Borat Spoof,"The best thing about this movie was Emmanuelle Chriqui - she kept my eyes glued to the set. Adam Sandler wasn't bad either. He hasn't exactly been going from strength to strength in the comedy dept but he's one to try anything.I really have a hard time deciding how to rate this - it's in utterly bad dumb taste, and some of the jokes aren't even funny. It was almost as bad as Little Nicky in some places, and nowhere near the brilliance of Sandler's early work like Happy Gilmore. Zohan tries to be like Borat in a way - outrageous but ""normal"" - it must be the accent.Those who aren't into toilet humor, bushy hair, the middle east, old ladies and wholly inappropriate behavior should definitely stay away.I'd be curious to know how the Palestinians would view the film..."
2,I laughed,"The silliness was over the top, I couldn't help it. SNL alumni and middle eastern comics and Chris Rock keep the viewer entertained even when Zohan is present. Not tasteful or incisive but this is Sandler the comic. What did you expect?"
1,"stay away, unless you like a 10 crotch jokes per hour","let me get this straight, I have never ever written a movie review. What drove me to invest my time in reviewing this one is the hope that God may erase a large chunk of my sins for the service I am about to provide you. STAY AWAY FROM THIS MOVIE!! Go spend your money on something classier, like any Mel Brooks movie. I literally felt like puking and had to abandon my wife in the TV room when I took shelter in my bed. Needless to say, after a disturbed night involving screaming, sweating and a hasty message that I left on a therapist's answering machine, I finally came to grips that the 45 or odd minutes I spent watching the movie, will require a regular regimen of diet, exercise, yoga and as mentioned before, a costly therapy session or two."
5,No conspiracy--but history,"Lomas is anxious to establish that the Royal Society for the Advancement of Learning was founded largely by (Jacobite) Masons. His arguments are a little stretched, but by and large persuasive. Along the way there are some great tidbits about Oliver Cromwell and the Restoration, especially about Charles II and the major Scotsmen of the era. EXCELLENT. Also, the very last part of the book does a plausible job of linking Masonic ""philosophy"" with the naissance of ""scientific thinking."" Finally, the last chapter has an excellent summary of what freemasonry is really about. As Masonic history it does a good job of pushing the origins back to about 1500 A.D. Worth noting is that there is a short, interesting and free book available online to purchasers of this book. Your copy will have a passcode to the website. Very good reading if you're interested in the development of our scientific outlook and related institutions."
2,Disappointing,"This book deals with Quantum cosmology, time (most contributors think that god is not eternal), the laws of nature, the problem of mind (they have a reductionist and evolutionary view) and the anthropic principle. The overall view of the book is neotheist. The authors are scientist or theologians.It is incredible that there is no contribution and no consideration of the many works of the philosopher William Craig, who is the authority in the matter. Many of his articles can be found at leaderu.com, and his book is more serious than this one (the debate with Smith: ""Theism, Atheism and Big Bang Cosmology""). Concerning the mind, Moreland's ""Immortality"" or Swinburne's ""The Evolution of the Soul"" are better works."
1,Extreme Diving???,"Being relatively new this sport I enjoy all the information that I can get. This however was not enjoyable. The title itself seems to be a marketing gimmick to get people to buy this book, at no time were any ""extreme"" aspects of diving mentioned, unless you count the ancient rebreather that is featured. If you need a BASIC 101 to see what diving is about this would be at best introductory."
5,Invicta Women's Pro Diver,The watch arrived in perfect condition prior to the promised date. It was the best price I found on the web with very reasonable shipping cost.
3,good,"everything is fine ,it's only too small to see the time maybe need to buy guys watch than can be see the time"
3,Quality issue after 1.5 years,"Was satisfied with the watch at first. Felt solid, functioned great. Wore it for surfing, swimming and diving. No issues. Then after 1.5 years, the blue dial that covers the edge of the face fell off. I looked at it one day and it's gone. I would glue it back on if I had the piece. The watch still works but it doesn't look nice. Seems a good quality watch should not have this issue. I looked for this part online but can't find it. The only option seems to be to send it in for $28 (shipping and handling) and more for Invicta to fix. I think I spent $85 on the watch."
4,Very nice watch,"This watch has all the features that I wanted. My only complaint is that the date is very difficult to read. Even with the magnifier it is not easy to see-I think the magnifier actually makes it worse. Otherwise, a good watch at a terrific price!"
5,Great watch,I have the same watch I have worn for at least 10 years. The finish on the band was finally wearing off so I bought one just like it
4,Good Looking,"The watch looks like good quality, it's a bit thicker and heavier than I had hoped for. The sleeve of my wet suit has to go over it easily and the thicker the watch is, the harder it will be."
4,Good light reading,"Picked up Trading in Danger from a bargain bin a while ago and quite enjoyed it. Saw this sequel (Marque and Reprisal) in the bookshop and picked it up for a bit of light reading. Was pleasantly surprised - far better than the first book in the series, not much by away of plot but lots of good action, well-written, all in all it delivers what it promises. Don't expect a David Weber & Honor Harrington saga, but on the other hand I did have a hard time putting it down."
3,Ok Lite Space Opera.,"I enjoyed this as a light read, with enough character and pace to make me want to read more. A bit like peanuts, you can't have just one. Compares favourably with early Heinlein."
3,Parody,"A space opera that reads like a written cartoon. Overgifted good guys, undergifted villains. Clever good guys, stupid bad guys. Overequipped good guys' ships, underequipped villains' ships. And, eventually, surviving heroes and dead rascals. When in need of some miracle, just make a good guy (in disguise) appear to take the snag away. Everything transparent and predictible. Don't look for more."
3,Still plodding along,"This book continues on the not-great not-terrible coat tails of Trading in Danger. It's just good enough to keep me engaged, though I read it over the span of about three months as the book I keep in my bag for slow moments.One of the things that's got me worried are the Mary Sues on the horizon in the form of Rafe and Toby. Toby is giving off that ever so foul Wesley Crusher odor with a dash of Boxy with his daggit. Oh, and the dog, whatever its name is, not cute.I could have gone for a lot less of Ky's ""I'm a KILLER--Rawr!"" introspection. Yeah, we get it that she's a displaced marine-type and that she'd rather be out there kicking butt and letting the bodies drop where they fall, but there's no need to repeat it in nearly every chapter.I'll continue reading this series mainly because it's not totally unbearable, and there's a lot of that on the market these days."
4,grest series,engaging characters and creative story line of what a future might be like. Yet similar to today. strong female chracters for a change in scifi
3,ANOTHER IN A SERIES!,I was hoping that there would be more to the story. Guess I'll have to wait for the next one!
5,Marque and Reprisal,"This is the second in a series of five bools which I enjoy reading over a number of times. The plot development is detailed elsewhere, I am only going to add that this book is also known as ""Trading in Danger"" in a number of countries."
4,Crystal Wisdom Review,"Written in a simple, easy to understand style. Does not take itself too seriously and is very enjoyable reading for fans of crystals."
5,Don't Wait ! Buy This Book !,"This is a great read ! Thought provoking, & well written. After reading this book, you'll find yourself saying ""Jeez, maybe I could do it !"" At the very least, you'll be thinking about the quality of your life now, and the way it could be. Don't hesitate - just buy the book......"
5,Well worth the purchase price!,"By following this books advice I saved over $1,700 by the time I finished reading it! It changed my perceptions on financial matters, thus giving me a viable alternative to pursuing my dreams. A light hearted, practical book."
4,"Altered Art:Techniques for Altered Books,Boxes,Cards&More",A very good book with great ideas. Have not had time yet to thoroughly read nor try out any techniques. From skimming I found some great ideas. A very good book for an art bookshelf to study & gain ideas & insight for your own art!
3,Where's the tape?,"I ordered this book and was dissapointed to find that it does NOT come with the instructional tape mentioned on the first page. I'm not even sure how to go about getting the tape. This book is $15, the tape should be included!"
4,Great for children,Wonderful beginning book for children to spark an interest in poetry. I actually had this poem (the owl and the pussycat) read at my wedding... everyone enjoyed it.
5,Love this watch. Love it.,"This watch is gorgeous. The worksmanship is excellent, the movement is precise, so far it seems sufficiently water resistant, and I got a 5 year extended warranty simply by purchasing it at Amazon. (I have not had to use the warranty, and hope that I won't need it, given other people's comments.) It looks a bit like a women's Rolex (of course, it isn't, but I can't afford a women's Rolex anyway). Each Invicta watch comes with a serial number, and the box it arrives in is showy, so if you are giving this to someone as a gift, they will likely be impressed. Mostly I like it because I was looking for a stylish, functional, water resistant watch with a nice band and a black face. This one fits that bill nicely, and it feels like a much more expensive watch than it actually is. For the price, it's a steal.By the way, the company that I bought it from on Amazon has excellent customer service."
4,Very Classy Watch,Very happy when I took this watch out of the box. Its looks expensive (but wasnt) is a great size for someone with a very small wrist as so many watches on the market are just too bulky. Keeps perfect time and the clasp is very hard to open so wont accidently unclip.
4,Nice But...,"Very nice time piece, but size is very small hard to read the time. This watch is better suited for a petite women with a very small wrist. It's a great watch through."
5,My Wife LOVES This Watch,"I bought this watch for my wife; she LOVES it and she's got very particular tastes in jewelry and fashion. I was concerned that being an Invicta brand, it would have a oversize face, not so. It's perfect on her wrist and can be worn with casual or upscale attire. Great value and price. Every woman should have a classic style watch for their wardrobe; this one is perfect."
4,It's about what I expected based on the previous reviews,"This was purchased as a gift for an 11 year old girl who wanted a ""grown-up watch."" For the price, the style was perfect and she absolutely loved it. The only negative is that it is so very difficult to read! It's just so small that I don't think this would work well for an actual grown-up."
5,bonito reloj,"El servicio es bueno, el envio es rapido. El reloj es de buen tamano para manos pequenas, bonito y elegante. me gusto mucho"
3,Nice looking watch,Although I like the looks of the watch I wear it as a braclet. It's not what I would call functional. I have a very difficult time reading the time. It's a real stuggle.
1,ArcSoft DVD SlideShow,"Putting together a thoughful slide shoe takes time and effort. Such was so in my case and when assembling my show in ArcSoft DVD Slideshow, I was very impressed in how it was coming together....until I tried to burn it to a DVD....IT DID NOT WORK !After several attempts, I went to ArcSoft's website and submitted my question, which of course, was answered by an automated service. It told me that I was using an outdated version 1.1.1.111 and I should be using version 1.1.1.114, and gave me instructions on downloading the update. These instructions were of no value. I then tried to query them again; this time getting no answer.Needless to say, I won't be buying anymore of ArcSoft's products."
1,Only works on some DVD players,"ArcSoft's DVD SlideShow is a good program that is very easy to use BUT it doesn't work on all DVD players. I spent a couple of days putting together a fifteen minute slide show for my wedding and was devistated when it didn't work on either of my two DVD players. After waiting for 20 minutes on hold for technical support they told me that I needed to check my DVD manuals to see if they support DVD-R or DVD+R media. NOWHERE in the software specs does it say this!!! If so I would have checked and saved my money.I still give it one star because if it did work on my DVD player it would have been a great program. Very user friendly and easy to use (which is good because it doesn't come with an instruction manual). If your DVD player supports the correct formats you'll probably be happy with it but remember, if you take it somewhere else it may not work and you will be very disappointed."
5,Tight,"Does exactly what it's supposed to do. Great value, fast shipping.Washers hold shaft tight to barrel. No constant re-tightening requiredProduct exactly as pictured and described. Received in perfect condition, packaged well"
3,Good inventory of disorders...,"...as they manifest themselves at the office. You'll definitely see some of the traits and behaviors described in the people you're working with. But... when it comes to coping with these types, as the title promises, I found the book short on practical methods for dealing with problem people. In some cases, the books states there's little or nothing that can be done about jerks on the job."
2,Lacks information,The arrangements are indeed simple and stylish but lacks step by step guide how to make the arrangements. This book is best suited for a seasoned florist
1,room for improvement,"The movie is about a teenage girl whos father died after falling of a horse, because her mother was already dead, they send her to a Ranch temporarily where she becomes a part of the family, they soon face a dillema when the town's Mayor is fighting to take buy out all of the towns land, including theirs.This movie was absolutely horrible! With bad acting and an over abunance of cheesy love scenes . The filming was so bad you would think it was filmed on a video camera. The plot was probably the only decent thing, besides the movies cover, which i am throughly convinced more money was spent on that then the movie itself."
2,disappointed,I found the pendant to be much smaller than it appeared on the web site. The chain was also in a knot when it arrived so I was never able to even try it on.
3,OK,"This bio on MM was just ok. Things people said like, Susan Strasberg & Robert Wagner, you probably already read in a MM book. I know I did. They have insight from the man who starred with her in ""River of no return"" (his name has slipped my mind) & I couldn't understand a word he said, bcz he's very old. From the above reviewer I thought it was going to be excellent, but it was just average. I did like the scenes they showed from her last movie, ""Something's got to give"", where she talks to the kids in the pool. It clearly shows why this woman was special & could not be touched. The way she speaks & her faical expression are so vulnerable, cute, & unique. Still, you could've seen that scene in another biography video. It is also a very 80's type bio & you can feel it is outdated. I liked The Biography Channel's bio on MM more."
4,Interesting,"This DVD was a really interesting look at the story of Robin Hood. After watching, I now feel that Robin Hood is probably a combination of actual historical figure and myth. I definitely have a new perspective on the subject, and anyone who finds the story of Robin Hood as interesting as I do would do good to watch it!"
2,Robin Hood the legend?,"I was disappointed in this video. There is music throughout the entire film which was quite annoying when all you want to do is listen to the narrator. The re-enactors have very little to do, it got tiresome seeing Robin and Marion walking past the same tree over and over. There was very little about the film versions of Robin Hood which is more what I was looking for. If you want the story of Robin Hood's springing from mythologies and religions of different cultures then you might enjoy this but I would advise you to borrow it from the library or someplace else first.The True Story of Robin Hoodis more entertaining."
4,Intriguing romantic fantasy --,"Linda Wichman weaves an intriguing tale of romantic fantasy about Rayn, the daughter of King Arthur and Queen Guenevere. Although I've read almost all the novels about Arthur, this is the first in which his heir is the main character. Merlin's son, Shadoe, plays the role of the hero, and the sparks of attraction and antagonism between them light the way throughout the challenges they face together.Most stories of the legendary king are steeped in magic and mysticism. Wisely, Wichman chose not to ignore that legacy, but instead incorporated the myths as the power of God working in His children. In contrast, she also shows clearly that Satan has the strength to help those who follow him.Vivid description abounds amid the struggle of good vs. evil as Shadoe and Rayn work together to save the island. I look forward to Wichman's future novels."
4,A solid first novel.,"Linda Wichman's classic romantic tale of adventure, myth, and the power of love is sure to become a favorite for anyone looking for a continuation of the legends surrounding Camelot. I look forward to seeing more great reads from this author."
5,Medieval History Brought to Life,"In this compellingly real love story, Linda Wichman successfully weaves history, legend and a touch of mysticism under the Christian realm. The foundation for the story is laid with characters nearly everyone has met somewhere along the way: Arthur, Guenevere, Lancelot and Merlin-but this book takes the legend to the next generation with fresh authority. Throughout the tale, the reader is reminded of God's power and supremacy while being thoroughly entertained in a story of good vs. evil and love that will not be suppressed. This novel is true to the faith it upholds while providing a romantic escape into a vividly portrayed legend."
2,Shockingly awful,"Seriously. If you are a Christian, and you have a secret love of lurid romance novels, you might give this a 5 star rating.But for the rest of us, this story is, well...shockingly awful. I love fantasy novels, and as a Christian I like try to find books that are acceptable for a Christian mind. This one had a nice name, and the cover looked interesting. It wasn't. The charecters were flat, with a horrible tendancy to make the strong minded main female charecter something to be ""tamed"" (which, by the way, she was.) And for a Christian book, I found the overt and unnecessary sexual references out of place. I don't mind sex scenes in a book if they are part of the story, but this book seemed to throw them in haphazardly.Please, support the cause of intelligent Christian readers everywhere and skip this book. If you want fantasy with a Christian perspective, try Stephen Lawhead or Tolkien."
4,Excellent commentary on Christianity and the modern world,"Volos is an angel who decides that he wants more than just singing praises to the Lord, and travels to earth to explore the pleasures of the flesh. He becomes a rock singer, and is joined in his strange journey by a disenchanted manager and a songwriter, a devout Bible-belt woman who has a strange, almost telepathic bond with the angel. This book explores what is wrong--and what is right--about faith, religion, and the modern world. It is an excellent book, a fine story that is also thought-provoking."
2,Good book but...,This is an interesting book and a harrowing tale. The trouble is the Kindle edition is full of typographical mistakes which is atrocious considering the retail price. Nearly every page contains a spelling error or typo. Has anyone bothered to proof read this book before charging good money for it?
1,Too many typos,I was really looking forward to reading this book...... But i can't! It has waaayyyy too many typos in it. Im actually really annoyed that i paid almost $10 for a book that i can't read! It should've been proof-read before being put up for sale!
3,Okay for kids,"This recorder looked better than the $5-$6 colored plastic ones at a local store, but the quality isn't any better. It still sounds like a kid's toy even though it doesn't look like one. The case is nicer though."
3,Good Quality for the Price,"Of the available brands of plastic recorder, this is probably one of the better ones. I own three soprano recorders, two Yamaha plastic and one Honer pearwood. The pearwood has distinctly superior tone, but also can only be played for a short time before moisture begins to negatively affect the tone and make some notes difficult to play.I'm still looking for the ""perfect"" recorder that is not too pricey, has great tone, and can be played for extended time without moisture problems impacting playability."
4,Better sound than my wooden recorder.,"I own a wooden soprano recorder, but I never play it anymore - I'm always playing this one. It has a very nice, warm sound. The price is a little high - if you're just starting to learn the recorder, buy a cheaper student model. But if you already know the basics of recorder and want to improve your sound, then this is a good product for you."
5,Recorder!,I recently purchased this recorder and I am very pleased with it. It has a very nice sound to it and it comes in its very own carrying case. It's a great deal for a cheap price!
5,"great recorder, great price",nothing more to say than what the title says... great instrument for a great price
1,Defective Construction,"I had purchased one of these recorders before and I'm very happy with the quality and sound of the instrument I already have, but I was very disappointed with the one I recently purchased from Brook Mays. Although it is the exact same brand and model of the one I already have, there is a serious issue with the construction of the instrument I just purchased. The head-joint is not aligned with the rest of the instrument, making playing awkward and difficult. When comparing both instruments side-by-side, it is apparent that the second instrument was not constructed like the first."
3,Better than others,"This ones is a little better than the loud plastic ones, but I guess I'm just not a recorder person, It still sounds like a toy to me. Maybe the very expensive ones would sound a little more rich, but I don't think I wanna play that bad. I'll just stick with the metal flutes for now."
4,Just a novice viewpoint,"My first plastic recorder. Nice instrument, however I find the Aulos instruments much better."
2,Economy Burner Covers,"For a Corelle product, it was not what I expected. I got exactly what I paid for."
2,"Ridiculously stiff, uncomfortable","I work as a full time bike mechanic and these are the stiffest brake hoods I've ever encountered for any bike. One of them even tore during installation even after being greased up and dismantling more of the brake lever than usual for these types of hoods. After getting them on they fit poorly, having a much boxier shape than is comfortable for any distance of riding, creating odd pressure points in your hands. Maybe they'll mold more to my grip in time, but at the moment I cannot give these more than two stars for being unreasonably stiff, easily tearable, and uncomfortable, with the only pro being that they're cheap."
