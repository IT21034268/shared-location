1,One star is being generous,"I am sooo glad I rented this waste of video tape. Somebody should hit this thing with a big magnet and recycle the video for taping footbal games or something. The acting looked like something out of a film school student project - using classmates as actors. Special effects - none. Costumes - the mummy looked like someone who had been standing outside when the kids TP'ed the house. I've never seen a mummy with such a big gut in front and on the other side - well, Mummy's got back!Throughout the whole movie I was making up excuses for the holes in the plot. The scariest part of the whole movie was the picture on the box at the video store. Which is all you need these days I guess."
1,Ancient Junk,"PLOT: A College has found an Aztec Mummy that was ment to gaurd the king or some supreme ruler. Only that person can bring him back to life. But Aztecs have been dead for hundreds of years so he can never come back...or can he? Someone knows how and they are using the mummy for revenge.STRAIGHT TALK: O.k. This new mod-horror flick was a waste of my 50 cents. Cool Cover Movie. The nerdy kid who is getting picked on just so happens to be the Aztec prince. He his scrawny and white he looks as much as an Aztec as a frog. He wears some kind of outfit when he does his rituals that looks like it came from the closet of Gary Glitter. The heartbeat of the mummy becomes very annoying and so the movie.CAST: ""Um uhh um oh no um uh a mummy""KILLS: Mod-Horror you don't see anythingCONCLUSION: This movie put me and my dog to sleep (seriously). Bad Acting,Cast,Kills,Plot= BAD MOVIE!"
5,IPO handbook for CEOs,I found this book had just the right amount of detail for the CEO without becoming tiresome. It gives a very good overview of the IPO process and provides plenty of recommendations to guide you along the way.
2,lose fitting,It definitely doesn't fit like the original dirt devil filter. was disappointed.....It really moves around lose. wouldn't buy more....sorry I bought so many
5,Made a Difference...,"I finally replaced the filter after almost 2 years of using my vacuum and my only wish is that I had done it earlier. The strength of the vacuum was insane, pulling up much more dirt. It felt like a brand new vacuum!"
4,"Seems to work, not Dirt Devil branded","Headline pretty much sums it up.Looking at the listing, you really can't be sure who makes this item - I read it carefully and still couldn't ascertain. When it came, it is definitely a third-party product. In reading the other reviews, I was pretty sure that would be the case. It fits and seems to work, so I suppose that I'm not overly concerned at the off-brand part, but it sure would be nice if both the seller and Amazon identified it as such. It feels deceptive to do otherwise."
4,Works on my Bissell,This fits on my Bissell Dirt Devil model #085845. The price was about 1/4 of the cost in the store. Now I can replace it annually without paying a ridiculous price. The prices in stores are like the ink refills for printers. It is not quite as tight as the original but still does the job.
5,Great!,Fast shipping. The filter has been working perfectly in our vacuum. I'm so glad we found these! Thanks for providing a quality product at a great price!
4,seems just right,"fits a little more loosely than I would have hoped, but its a great replacement, and can't argue with the cost."
5,HEPA Filter For Dirt Devil Upright Vacuum Cleaners,This is a filter required by the Dirt Devil upright vacuum in our home. I couldn't find this item at Wal-Mart who used to sell them and found it at Amazon for the same price including shipping as it sold for at Wal-Mart 13 months ago.
3,It's a filter,Not sure what I should say about a vacuum filter. It performs as it was meant to. I would purchase again.
4,Not too bad...,The item arrived in a timely manner and it fit my vacuum just right. My only complaint is that the quality is a little cheaper than what I expected for the price.
1,Caution: Does not fit firmly on Featherlite,"Caution: This filter does not fit firmly on the Dirt Devil Featherlite upright bagless vacuumm. I am disappointed by this fact because the original F1 filter from Dirt Devil fixes firmly on the base, both filters are identical though this one does not. Have to put paper packing while fixing this filter in vacuum."
3,Does what it is supposed to but description is misleading,"Item is misrepresented as being a Dirt Devil 3JC0280000, which is Dirt Devil's own part number for the F1 HEPA filter. However what you ultimately get is NOT a 3JC0280000, it is a third party replacement which is not Genuine Dirt Devil. While the filter does fit and seems function properly (I can only assume that is filters as well as the genuine part), it is highly misleading that you would get the genuine part."
4,Breezze bagless MODEL M088160,"The filter was very snug, its a little hard getting it off to empty. But other than that i does the job. This is a generic filter it is NOT made by dirt devil. Shipping was speedy and FREE! it gets the job done and that's all that matters"
5,Dirt Devil 3JC0280000 Universal HEPA Filter for Bagless Uprights,The filter was as the origional filter was. It's the best vaccum we have ever owned.
3,Unsure of the quality,"This filter fit my DD vac as advertised, but I'm not sure of the quality.There are 2 types of HEPA filters: ""True"" HEPA and ""HEPA type"". True HEPA filters at 99.7%.When I received my package, it was in an unlabeled container, and the product has not markings at all, so it's unclear if this is a real HEPA filter. (The picture on Amazon shows a product with the DD label on top.)If you have allergies, this is an IMPORTANT point.I wish the manufacturer and the seller would ID their product.Also unclear -- WHO is the seller? I ordered from and received from ""Allergy Be Gone."" But this web page says I ordered from ""VacuumSupplyStore."" Who's who?It all seems sketchy."
3,Was not right for me,I own a Dirt Devil Featherlite bagless vacuum and I have to say this filter did not fir right. It was very wobbly in the canister and almost fell over in it when I tilted the vacuum. Some people used electrical tape to make it fit but .... really it just gets really yucky after a while. But I still gave it 3 stars because of the customer service the company provided! They refunded me my money without having to return the item! I guess I have to try a different filter next.
2,Dirt Devil F1 HEPA Filter,"I needed this filter badly when the original one has worn out. I have changed it with the new one that I have bought very recently. I have cleaned the carpets & rooms 3 times. Suddenly I realized that the filter doesn't fit properly in the socket, it is loose! It means dust leaks out of the machine. Now I cannot use it anymore, and I have to to look for another filter. It is supposed to be the original (not generic) Dirt Devil F1 HEPA Filter, and good one. I shall not recommend this to anyone. I request the seller to give a replacement."
4,Dirt Devil Filter,"Much better product than Arm & Hammer Vacuum Filter available through Walmart since it has a heavy duty rubber base! Previous order from this company was in Dirt Devil's original packaging. This order came without the fancy packaging and didn't have the green label for knowing when to change the filter. However, it fit just as well after initial installation. (Had to press a little harder to get a secure fit.) Be sure to order correct part by number and you'll be pleased with this company. (Order received quickly and securely packaged.)"
4,Gets the job done,"Bought this filter online because it was reasonably priced compare to other retailers. Wal-Mart wanted $20 for the exact same thing. The product came about 4-5 days after I ordered it online but it was severely damaged. I had to call the company and they did an excellent job getting another one sent to me promptly. This time it was in good condition. I place it in my vacuum and it fits just like the original one did, except it made my vacuum extremely hard to push. I assumed it's because the filter was new. I will run my vacuum some more to see if there are any changes. If my vacuum doesn't become easier to push over time as I use this filter. I will have to purchase an original Dirt Devil filter, but all in all this one did what it was suppose to do."
3,Not Dirt Devil brand but works fine,"This is not an official Dirt Devil brand filter. The picture and title make it seem that way, but it's definitely a second party filter. However, that said it seems to work just fine and fit just fine. Would really have no problems if they would just label it differently so you know you're not getting an official Dirt Devil filter."
2,Amazon / Replacement filter marginally effective,"The vendor transaction was a breeze and occurred without a hitch, delivered expediently. However, this replacement filter did not fit snugly onto the vacuum's filter column. Because there is play in the fit and airspace as well, I don't feel it's as effective. I am considering just replacing the vacuum cleaner since it seems to be so difficult to find the proper filters."
5,"fits BETTER, less post-vacuum dusting","My Dirt Devil Vision is about 10 years old now, and I thought that it was losing power. I had been buying another off brand at a big box store that was for my vacuum, and replaced them every 6 months as it instructs in the manual. They seemed to fit OK, but I thought, since I just started Prime, to forgo the box store and order here. I'm glad I did, these are very snug filters, and I feel like my Vision has it's suction back. I'm not having to dust AFTER I vacuum, or wipe down my vacuum. I would gladly recommend these filters, even if they aren't brand name."
5,Excellent: better than the local retail equivalent,An excellent product with a rubber shaft collar. The equivalent product in a store is much more expensive and frankly not as good. Very happy with the product.
1,DISAPPOINTED WITH MATE,The cost to purchase was fantastic and the quality was great except for one item.The filter I received did not fit my Dirt Devil sweeper. My Dirt Devil is model 088160 MFG code 109A and it calls for a F1 filter.. The filter I received inside diameter was too big to mate with my Dirt Devil.I did not attempt to return for credit or replacement since I had used and trash can it.I am disappointed with myself for not giving the seller the opportunity to correct the problem.
2,Ok for the price,"Comparing with the original that came with the vacuum cleaner, this filter looks and functions like an 2nd grade after market filter."
2,Not happy,"Another case of you get what you pay for. I ordered this filter, thinking it was the ""authentic"" filter for my Dirt Devil but at a reduced price. The filter I received seemed to be some generic brand, and did not fit properly in my sweeper. It flopped around instead of fitting tightly as the original filter had. But at one-third the price, I figured it was worth a try. I won't buy it again. I've since purchased a different sweeper anyway, but no, I would not recommend this product as a substitute for the ""real thing""."
3,Hepa Filter,This item is ok. It just don't seem to fit right in the cannister like the one that came with the vacuum cleaner.
2,Even the one sold by amazon is a knockoff,"Others have already mentioned that this is not an original Dirt Devil product. I assumed that people were buying the third party options and that was the problem so I went ahead and paid an extra $10 for the one sold by Amazon. Nope, that one is a knockoff too. I'm sure it probably works just as well. However, it's a little annoying that the title of the item is misleading. Next time I will buy the one sold by the cheapest vendor."
1,not a dirt devil filter,"Says ""Dirt Devil filter"", says it's ""by Dirt Devil"", even has the green sticker, but I received an off-brand that doesn't fit anywhere near as tightly as the OEM filter did."
2,Dirt Devil F1 HEPA Filter,It looks cheap. There is a green label on top in the picture. But the one I got has no label on filter so I have no idea who made it or product information.
2,THIS IS NOT UNIVERSAL,It is very loose in my dirt devil but kind of works. I will never recommend this to anyone. I am so glad I kept my old one. I washed the old one and will leave it to dry in the window for about 5 days.
5,great price for hard work,"This universal filter fits well ans so far does the job, all at a great price"
1,"False advertising, shocked amazon allows it!","This filter says it is dirt devil, but it is not. I got it and put it on my dirt devil featherlite and it did not even fit. I immediately returned it. I may have been able to rig it to work, but since it was advertised as an official dirt devil filter, I refuse to keep it just out of principal. Know that you are getting a cheap knock off if you buy this filter!"
1,"Off Brand, not Dirt Devil","""I ordered a filter for a dirt devil vacuum cleaner. The advertisement clearly showed a dirt devil branded filter (the image included a green sticker, which is indicative of dirt devil branded filters). Also, the title was ""Dirt Devil Universal HEPA Filter for Bagless Uprights."" However I received an off brand filter that does not fit properly. Very deceptive."""
1,Received knockoff brand,"I purchased this item thinking I would pay a little extra to get the Dirt Devil brand, but received a knockoff.This is NOT what appears to be advertised and NOT what I expected. Returned and reviewed."
5,Great Replacement Filter,"This was bought as a replacement filter for my vacuum. Made of plastic, rather than thick filter paper, it was easy to clean and use again and again! I would recommend this to ANYONE looking for an easier way to clean their vacuum filter!"
5,works great,works great and not sure why I have to write a specific number of words for this to qualify when it is not necessary.
4,Filter,Works great for me. My wife typically changes the filter and I have no complaints. This is a good product.
4,"not a BRAND ""dirt devil""",i kinda figured for the price it wasnt going to be the dirt devil brand. even though picture does have green tag like another user pointed out. its just a off brand filter. it still fits inside my dirt devil swivel. i dont have any compliants with it. i cant find filters at my location and my old one was way over due for replacement. amazon again offered free shipping.
4,Shipping,"Product is fine as it is the only filter for the vacuum; however, we ordered it on 6 Oct and received an email stating it was shipped on 6 Oct but didn't receive it until 25 Nov."
5,Hepa Filter,The item is just what I needed. My Dirt Devil still works fine but was difficult to find filters at the local stores. Now we are back to cleaning all of the micro particles from the house and my allergies are at peace.
5,HEPA Filter,Will never do a vacuum with a bag ever again. Love the Dirt Devil with the HEPA Filter that I can clean and reuse every time I vacuum.
4,sucks,yes i will by more when i need them best thing that came out of China good good good good good
3,May be wrong size for my Dirtdevil,It could be me but I believe the filter is the wrong size for my model. I am not complaing and will check further. The filter is well constructed and delivery time was reasonable.
1,No such thing as a free lunch.,"The reason why these filters are so cheap is that they are defective. Sorry, but whoever is selling these filters needs to bring them to the landfill and cease selling them."
3,Not Sure If it's Authentic!,"The product came in pretty quick. However, it is sent in a plastic mailing bag without the original packaging box! I have seen this product in store before and they all come with a box. By receiving only the filter itself and a receipt from the seller, I'm not sure if the product I purchased is the authentic one made by Dirt Devil or just a generic one. Sure, the price is very competitive here, comparing to their official website. However, if this is just a generic filter, I would like to see it stated in the product details!"
1,dissatisfied,"I am not satisfied with the product I purchased. It doesn't fit the way it should. While it goes in properly, when I vacuum, it tilts, poorly effecting the performance of the vacuuming. I would not purchase this product again."
2,Not good enough,Firstly this filter did not fit properly. Then the dirt was not being cleaned properly for the very first use. I should have gone with the original from Dirt Devil. I am going to buy the original. I am sure my Vaccum cleaner is working fine.
5,Good filter...keeps the vaccum working.,Have had the Dirt Devil Bagless Upright for 5 years now and finally got a new filter. The new one keeps the vaccum working pretty good. The filter picks up massive amounts of dust and gunk for a small space.
1,Doesn't Fit Vaccuum,"I did check to see if my model number was listed. It is. However, the filters do not fit the vacuum. It would be one thing if I didn't check, but it's bothersome that Amazon's information is incorrect. And if there happens to be the same model number in use for different vacuums (ones for which the filter works and ones for which it does not), it would be helpful if Amazon makes that expressly clear."
1,usgabear,"This replacement F-1 Hepa Filter was recommended by Amazon to be purchased with the Dirt Devel Dynamite Plus vaccum, the Dynamite Plus requires a F-2 Hepa Filter not an F-1 therefore the F-1 is useless for this vaccum.Amazon also recommended a Style 12 replacement belt for the Dynamite Plus, the replacement belt should bea Style 15 therefore the Style 12 is also useless...."
4,Satisfied customer,"Filters are as described and work well in my dirt devil vacuum, though not quite as sturdy as the previous filters that I have used. Product was shipped promptly."
5,Great Filter for a much Lower Price,"We searched for this filter at various stores that sells the Dirt Devil product line. All of the locations wanted $25 to $40 for the filter. Amazon is selling the after market filter for $7.89Our Dirt Devil Vacuum has a new life and is working more proficiently. We saved a great deal of money.Thanks Amazon,Dave & Stephanie"
3,Not original,The filter I received from B & M Housewares was not original and did not fit tightly. I was able to add a layer of tape to the connector and now it seems to work okay.
3,Not the original one but it fits,The filter is not the original one. On the image you can see the green label on the top but the label was missing.Anyway it fits well and works fine.
2,Not perfect fit,"The filter I received doesn't fit very well: it seems a bit too large. The problem is not such that the cleaner lost dust in air and it seems to retain the dirt, but in example if the vacuum cleaner falls on ground, without particular force, the filter goes out of place."
4,Worked just fine,"It fit a little funny did not go all the way down like the original did, but it works the same"
3,Not quite a fit,"It's the same F1 filter that my Dirt Devil Featherlite describes, but it's not quite the same filter that came with it, and it doesn't quite fit. A little bit of electrical tape snugs it up enough to use, and I'm sure the filter quality is perfectly fine, but that alone doesn't cut it.The slightly more conical ""F1 filter"" that came with the vacuum is nowhere to be found on Amazon or anywhere else I looked. I like the bagless thing, but for my next vacuum purchase I'll probably skip Dirt Devil."
5,Great Price,"These filters are available everywhere, Amazon had the best price. A full $8 cheaper than the cheapest place I could find them (Target)."
1,NOT for Dirt Devil Dynamite Bagless Upright M084650RED,"I purchased a Dirt Devil Dynamite Bagless Upright with On-Board Tools - M084650RED - and the recommended items frequently purchased with the vacuum were a spare belt and this HEPA filter. Problem is, this filter is twice the size of the filter used by the vacuum I purchased, so it is absolutely useless. Not worth the time & effort to return it for a refund, so it will be going out in the trash. Thanks a lot Amazon.. :-("
1,Deceptive,This was listed as frequently bought with the vacuum I bought but it was not the correct filter. This is misleading.
4,Exact Replacement for Dirt Devil Vacuums Using F1 Filters,"This is an authorized product for Dirt Devil vacuums and as far as I can tell, it is a genuine Dirt Devil product. It's easy enough to replace the old one with this new one. This filter fits perfectly onto the protruding part inside the canister where the filter goes. It isn't loose at all. It was amazing to replace the filter as the vacuum seemed to have renewed life and now can pick up anything like when it was new. My vacuum hasn't sucked this much in years! (All puns intended)"
4,Cleaninglikecrazy,"I bought the Hepa filter for dirt devil vac. It came a few days after it said it would, but I blame that on the weather not the company. They work great. I would order them again."
4,Seems fine...,"But I think they need to change their description. I don't believe this is as true dirt devil filter... It doesn't really fit snug in my bagless upright, yet I made sure the model numbers exactly matched. This is the exact one I need, but I dont remember the filter ever being this loose... Strange... Either way, the filter seems fine, I just think the description needs to be changed because it's a generic filter."
5,Works great!,"I went to Target for a replacement filter after my daughter threw out a perfectly good one. $25! This works great and I saved ten dollars even with shipping costs. BTW, Dirt Devil Featherlight."
3,"Not bad for $20, but you can do better","I picked up the special edition of Perfect Dark Zero simply because it only set me back $20. Honestly though, after playing Gears of War (and wasting entirely too much of my free time playing the Halo 3 beta), you can see how far shooters have come in two years. The sound and graphics are still on par with some of the better Xbox titles, but PDZ falls short when it comes to gameplay. The action feels clunky and archaic...like I'm playing an N64 game with better graphics. If you need a cheap way to scratch your FPS itch, then pick this up. But if you want the best the Xbox has to offer, pick yourself up a copy of Gears of War."
2,This Game Sucks,"Graphics - 2 out of 5Fun 1 out of 5Game = BoringI bought this game because i had heard the hype about it, that it was supposed to be all next gen and the new halo, but it was definatly not, do not but this game, get call of duty instead..."
5,awsome first person shooter,this is defenitly a top notch shooter right there with haloas far as the campaighn goes the multiplayer i haven't had a chance to trybut get this game it's amust for the xbox 360
4,"Limited edition not all that special, but a fun game.","I don't really see the point in getting this game in limited edition packaging, it's not like it's a major game like Halo or something of that level.The game:It's a fun game to play, the story line is decent and although I think it to be a bit short in length for the story it was a good game none the less.Online play:This is the games strong point. The online play is fun, the weapons are pretty cool. The fly by wire kind of missles are always a blast to come up on the other players and BAM they explode. Some people get a little too crazy with the sniping aspect of it but other than that it's still good to pop in and play from time to time."
2,Perfect Dark Zero,"I have to say right of the bat that this does not seem like a next generation game, the graphics are incredibly bland and blocky, the game is buggy, and the story is just plain boring and nonsensical. Now, that being said, the game is very much playable, and the bugs do not cripple it, but overall the game is just one big snoozefest. Had the game come out on PS2 or Xbox years ago, it would have been an average game, but I expect a little more in games nowadays, and this game is just not very polished, and honestly, just not that much fun. I played through this once, and maybe somewhere down the road I'll give it another shot, but for now, one play to the end is all I can endure."
3,Graphics nice... Game play is something so familiar,"I played this game and I was ok with it, it just felt so familiar, like I have played it before. I guess if your interested in a shooter go a head, if your look for a game to pass some time and you have 60 bucks to throw around DON""T just rent it for a weekend and it will be all and done with. The only reason I gave it a three on both instances is because, I would expect a little bit more from this and its not a next gen game!"
4,Not bad... But not good either.,"This game is actually quite fun when you sit down and play it for a while. HOWEVER, it is nowhere near as good as the original! The shooting feels odd, the animations are weird, and the voice acting is awful! But beneath all that is game that is still fun even to this day! (I guess maybe it is a little bit like the orignal.) ;D"
3,Not so 'perfect'...,"I must respectfully disagree with the reviewer below me. I snagged this game last night on the assumption that it would push the power of my new 360 console. Sadly, Microsoft's 'flagship' title for the Xbox 360 offers not much new to the FPS genre, to include the purported 'revolutionary' graphics. I'm not knocking the game, it is enjoyable and the multiplayer action on Live is tremendous fun. I'm simply not seeing anything here that wouldn't have looked incredible on my old Xbox, much less a justification to buy a next-gen console.Conclusion: If you're making PD0 the cornerstone of your arguement to buy a new Xbox 360 this weekend, I'd recommend another title that DOES showcase the abilities of this amazing machine, such as Call of Duty 2 or Kameo.I hope this helps."
4,"Good, But Not Perfect Dark 64","I was OK with the graphics (I expected photorealism, I guess), but the actual gameplay in single player mode seemed very repetitive--how many times do I have to kill this b****'s hologram and fight these stone samurais...for real?? I tried multiplayer next...and I was practically hooked! PD64 is my favorite game because of the customizable features in the Combat Simulator, and I was glad the 360 game retained MOST of that. I'm sure most FPS fans will like it, but the multiplayer is the redeeming value."
2,Not worth going back to,"I decided to pick up a used copy of this game up for a cool $8, thinking back to the good old days when I had a ton of fun with the original Perfect Dark on N64. Mistake. It is ridiculous to think that I could go back to the days when FPS games included enemies that moved erratically about the screen and entirely too fast, a ridiculously meaningless and poorly acted story, and a complete lack of clear objectives in-mission, and enjoy the game I was playing. Do yourself a favor, and go play just about anything else."
2,Horrible just plain sucks....,This game plainly sucks...the graphics are not that good and the gameplay is just stupid...I don't understand what all the hype is about and honestly you can find much better games in other titles...horrible...just plain horrible.
3,HUGE disapoint ment,"Ya this game is ass. I thought it was gona be amazing and have great game play and some kick ass guns. I was wrong the trailers looked amazing because they showed the only good parts of the game. I jus rented this game (THANK GOD) but it is hardly worth the 8$. I couldnt beliv how lame the game play is and how it tries to be a stealthy game when its just a regular old fps with nothing new to offer. The graphics are AMAZING and the maine chick is hot , but that is abou it nothing else to this game but runing and guning.My opinion just rent the game or wait til its a greatest hit."
3,Watch reviews on youtube before buying :/,Perfect dark zero is a sequel from the original perfect dark on the N64 and XBLA but is it worth it? yes and no. while the game wasnt god awful it was still bad the story was dull the weapon mechanics were awful the graphics were okay and the online had little to no people playing it. its a game to check out but not worth keeping
5,Great review book,"Love it! Functions like the BRS Pathology book but for neuroradiology. Nice concise reviews with a couple of images of the disease process. Also, it cites an article or two for each topic -- so you can then get a more in depth understanding if need be."
4,Great read,"Great book. However, I would recommend the electronic version in the hopes of an update on the authors original image captions. Many of the images do not accurately cross reference previous sections of the text. For example, Figure 28-124 will cite Figure 28-133 when it really wants you to look at 28-123. These types of mistakes which are not factual are likely the editor's fault. Either way at $75.00 for the book I shouldn't have to correct it. That's why I took one star off. If I could go back I would buy an electronic version in the hopes of a minor update."
4,A capable Latin Grammar,"I recommend this book to you if you've progressed beyond your original textbook. I won't recommend that you buy this with your Wheelock textbook; I will, however, that you consider buying it when you've finished Chapter 40 of Wheelock! If you're planning to do composition, the consideration ought to be so much shorter, since you'll need a good grammar. Other choices with which I've been pleased are the books 'New Latin Grammar' and 'New Latin Syntax', both of which are also from Bolchazy-Carducci. The first is interchangeable with this title, IMO, while the latter book you may wish to buy even in addition to one of these.And for those who are seeking a small grammar that can be of use to a beginner or an intermediate student, I recommend to them 'A Student's Latin Grammar' by Oxford Press. That book features all of the necessary grammar for reading Latin well, although it likely isn't detailed enough to help with the composition of good Latin."
2,Tolerable.....just.,"This is just barely tolerable. VERY superficial overview but somewhat fun and interactive. Well, that is, the two voices in the program, one male and one female seem to interact nicely. THAT's as interactive as it gets. Overally, if it says HIGH ACHIEVER or QUICKSTUDY and it's MATH-related, I would avoid it."
2,Little More Then a Pamphlet,While it did reflect Danish culture there was no depth to the insights. It was disappointingly skimpy - little more then a pamphlet.
1,does not work without 3d accelerated video,This software does not work without 3D accelerated video card. I wish Amazon or Disney had mentioned that in their ad. Now my granddaughter has the program but can not use it.
3,Not What I Thought,Canbius is known to eat eat eat mc's and on this album it is like he threw up all over the cd. I mean i love canibus but he could of gotten a record label and made this cd much better. There is 21 tracks and like 7 are skits. Some good beats but the rest are wack. Some ill flows. 2 tracks are freestyle tracks. All this cd is is tell a story about his life there's really not a lot of rapping in this cd. If you really like canibus get it but if you think he's aight then don't get this cd. In conclusion this cds sucks but i garantee his next album will be sick like never before and he'll have a record deal.
1,Misunderstood...,"While most of us agree this is Canibus' most disappointing release, everyone has their own interpretation of this album. After listening to ""Bis vs. Rip"" off of the ""Mic Club"" album, this disc made a little more sense to me. I look at this this disc as the introduction to Rip the Jacker. An unusual introduction, considering the fact that he was absent from most of the album. This album was executed and delivered by the Canibus personality with little help from the Rip the Jacker alter ego. And the result was disasterous! Until Canibus reveals the intent of this album, it will always be misunderstood and (like someone else mentioned)be the worst album ever released by an MC of his caliber."
3,Pretty GOod. Weird how he talks about eminems Stan So much,"I guess this is Canibus's response to Eminem mentionin him in his songs. He talks about saving ""Stan"" in one song.... Wierd but interesting. Not a bad Cd."
2,"2.5. Funny thing is.. some of Canibus most accessible songs are on this.. and yeah, I know, this is C True Hollywood Stories..","But listen.Songs like Hott Tonight.. the beat is cute, to be honest with you.. something that I could SERIOUSLY consider banging at a party, just for sh*ts and giggles lol..Hate U 2.. with some serious bass, this song is actually some serious stuff lol.. I don't know.R U Lyrically Fit- straight up flame.. the first dude Luminati is AWFUL.. but Canibus spits straight up the most sure-fire stuff on the album for his duration.Boxcutta Bladerunner is nasty.. straight up banging track.Draft Me- not bad.. I can listen..Different Vibe in LA- below average mainstream attempt.. but pleasurable."
2,Disappointing,"His career was off to a great start when he first made an appearance on Gone Till November with Wyclef. His first two albums were excellent. His lyrics are beyond any rapper out there. I would buy Can-I-Bus and 2000 B.C before I spend money on this album. This album was a huge disappointment and I regret spending the money. I would recommend listening to some of the tracks and judging for yourself. Hopefully, his next effort is worth checking out."
2,"Lost @ ""C"" True Hollywood Stories","This is just the worst by Canibus. When I got this album, I was hoping for another 2000 B.C. but I was wrong. I have never heard Canibus spit so many terrible lyrics in my life. I have been a big Canibus fan since I heard him with the Lost Boyz. I, a huge fan, saw a change in his style and his lyrics. Even his voice sounds different in this album. Canibus, who I used to consider being one of the greatest lyricist, has become commercial like all these other MC's who did rather well until they started to talk about garbage. I notice that ""C"" True Hollywood Stories has no point to it at all. He obviously didn't get motivated to make it better. I think if he motivates himself, his albums would be great, maybe better than 2000 B.C. Canibus is the greatest alive, but he will have to erase ""C"" True Hollywood Stories with another album that'll hopefully be great. Who knows, he'll probally name it 2002 BC.T.H.S. (Before ""C"" True Hollywood Stories)"
3,Canibus:Apreciation or Trick?,"Canibus' albun is alright but does have it's good points.He mocks Eminem with his ""Stan"" impersenations like ""U Didn't Care"" in which he disses Eminem.He also disses Jay-Z and Beanie on ""I Gotta Story 2 Tell"" which is a reponse to what Beanie said about him in the summer.Beanie said ""I'll Rock your bells like L,I ain't Canibus."" Canibus shines on ""A different Vibe in LA"" ""Boxcutter,Bladerunner"" and some other tracks.some tracks are funny such as ""Hate U 2"" and ""Luv U 2."" This just makes me have 2 points.either 1)Canibus is making the industry and fans apreciate his music after judging his first 2 cd's so much or 2)Canibus is setting up the biggest industry stunt ever.That i mean he has another album dropping in 2002 and that album will be full of the tightest lyrics and production ever.then he will shock everybody and i hope the 2nd one is true."
1,this CD sucks (...),"Cani's new album was unexpectedly wack... no disrespect to bis... i mean i've stood by him since da beginning and i'm still standin by him, but this album was da wackest (...) i've eva heard. i aint feelin da whole ""stan"" theme he got in his album, its lame..."
1,"Canibus brings the sickest drama, But now just garbage!","I once believed that Canibus was an untoucable Mc, one with both great flow and rhyming ability, but after just listening to HALF of his new album, I now believe diferently. He should stick with what he does best, battle rapping. He is trying to hard to make his lyrics commical with stupid phrases in hopes to somehow mimic the style of Eminem. Its not working! This album was a GREAT disapointment being that his first two had some of the best lyrical quotes I have ever heard. Even on ""Beasts from the East"", one of Lost Boyz best song on there second album ""Love,Peace and Nappiness"", Canibus tears up the spot for over half the song, its just amazing. Although I still consider myself a Canibus fan, I dont consider myself a fan of this album. Dont waist your money, but if you do decide to spend money on canibus, buy some herb, maybe it will help make you forget how terrible this album is."
2,A disappointment for hardcore Canibus fans,"Canibus has lost his appetite for eating emcees. It becomes clear in this third release that he will probably never drop another hardcore album. He talks more about women in this album and sex, and about his humble beginnings. Only in the song Draft Me! where he addresses the September 11th attacks does he come off hardcore, and even then he shares the mic with C-4 a new white rap band he is helping to promote. His signature styles are virtually non-existent in this release. The transition would be tolerable if not for the terrible beats and choruses. Not to mention most of the tracks are skits, making it sound more like a musical than a rap album. Only hardcore Canibus fans should even consider buying this and to those that are: prepared to be disappointed."
1,Can-You-Not-Bus?,"This album is terrible. The only reason I gave it one star is because of ""A Different Vibe In LA"" and perhaps ""The Rip Off"" - All other songs seem like mixtape rejects. His beats are terrible, for example the Super Nintendo esque ""Hate U 2"" which is followed by ""Luv U 2"" which uses the exact SAME beat for two songs. Some say Canibus is a deadly lyricist, I say he's a has been who thinks there's someone out there who still cares. Give up Canibus - Eminem beat you, LL beat you, Wyclef ditched you...Retire C."
2,:(,"I had been waiting for this album since Bis's last one...well...I am prepared to wait longer cuz i was mad disappointed. The rhymes he spits are still tight, but definitely not his best. But again, the beats and production on this album are garbage. Bis has waaaay too much talent to waste on garbage production. I'd like to see him team up with Rockwilder, Pete ROck, RZA, Dre, and hell, even the Neptunes. Canibus is one of my fave MCs ever, and definitely one of the nicest, but this album is probably his worst. Almost evey song on the album he is dissing someone which is aiight, but if ur going to dis someone, spit that fire over a hot beat and not some garbage that sounds like amusement park music. I'm out."
1,Where have all the battle wizards gone?,"I was pretty excited for this album. Somewhere along the line I heard that Canibus was enlisting someone to lay solid beats; however, this was certainly not the case. Usually I would say that Canibus's rhyme style & pattern would compensate for lackluster beats; not on this album though. I thought Chino XL's new album was a disappointment. All in all I would have liked Canibus to maintain his rhyme format, but instead you get a watered-down version of an ill emcee."
1,The Biggest Disappointment of the YEAR!,"If you like Canibus don't buy this album. ""C Hollywood Stories,"" is about a lyrically captivating as a 504 boyz track. Never in my life have I heard such a pathetic display of rhymes by Canibus. If you like Canibus this album will change your mind. Don't make the mistake I did... trust me you will be disappointed."
2,worst 'Bis CD by FAR,This is not a Canibus cd if you ask me. He doesn't sound like himself and is obsessed with this attack on Eminem (never says his name). His production on this is horrible and his rhymes ain't that good. Has about 4 songs worth listening to and the people he features on here all suck. The good ones are:Box Cutta Blade Runner (2+ minutes straight)Different Vibe In L.A.C - True Hollywood StoriesDraft Me (f/ C-4)check all my reviews
2,CAN-I-BUST AGAIN!!!!!,"I been by Canibus from the beginning. Canibus first cd was medicore with good lyrics, but lousy production. The second cd was what his 1st was supposed to be raging lyrics, with the beats to match. But it was slept-on by the people, leaving Universal with no choice but to dump him. The new album is another sorry way to sell albums: dissing. Why is he dissing Eminem? Jay Z? Beanie Siegal? Jadakiss? The production sounds like they made it with a child's keyboard. The lyrics with made Canibus the illest, are now watered down and he still has trouble making SONGS."
2,teach youself physics,i expected an in depth look in to physics like the one on teach yourself calculus but instead it is a grammar school intro that has no depth or math
3,Fast Shipping,Everything was very smooth with this transaction. These are a not so easy to find ribbon. Very easy on Amazon.
2,it's okay,it's just a cheap duplicate of the government produced manual. ok if you can't find same or similar elsewhere.
3,The title overstates the quality of the puzzles,"After reading this book, I question the use of the word ""great"" in the title. The puzzles are quite old and commonplace rather than new and interesting. Most of them have appeared many times in other publications. For example, the following type of puzzles all appear in this book:*) What questions do you ask of two people where one is known to always lie and the other will always tell the truth?*) How to measure one liter when all you have only a 3 and a 5-liter jug?*) There are 11 people at a party and they clink glasses before they drink. How many times are glasses clinked together?*) ""My son is 24 years younger than I am. He, in turn is 25 years older than my grandson. My grandson and I are together 73 years old. How old is the grandfather?""If you are experienced in puzzling, then it is likely that there will not be a single puzzle in this collection that you have not seen before. Therefore, the title is an overstatement."
4,Wonderful little speakers... when you crank them.,"For the price and the size, I've never listened to a pair of speakers that could produce such rich, clean sound. My only problem with them is the fact that you really have to crank them loud to make them sound good. They sound a bit muddy at low volumes, which one should take into consideration. As I live in a college dorm, this isn't a good thing. I purchased a pair of Boston Acoustic CR-9's instead... which are slightly inferior in overall imaging, but sound great at low volumes, as well as when you crank them. I'll probaably upgrade to some floor-standing B&W's after I get my own place, however."
2,REALLY ONLY ONE PROBELM.....,"BEATS BEATS BEATS, the only place the LP falls short , dont get it twisted APATHY is one of the top 10 mc's alive with the word play & delivery ... dude rest in the rhythm ... but if I can't nod my head to the beat .. its a bit hard to rock with the track. Worth having if your a real head & you want to have it for the collection."
2,what happened to Apathy?,"So I just got the new Apathy disc after months of its release date being push back and back,and it was exactly what i had hoped it wouldn't be....Lacking. The beats are fine but the lyrics just aren't up to par with past Apathy. Its almost as though he said Good enough and put this out without thinking about all of the people who have followed him for years. There are a few good ones on here but none of it is really standout.Alot of boring guest appearances and uninspired topics. If you have never heard Apathy before maybe you'd like it better but if your a fan already be cautious."
1,ONLY 24 PAGES !!!,"Gawd - I missed the page count, thought it was a full book.It's not. It's a $8 pamphlet that is vauge, nebulous, and wholly lacking in content worth the money asked. If you want the pamphlet view of Chaordic Organizations, go to the website. It's free.http://www.chaordic.org/"
2,a tad overrated for hbk and disel,hbk vs diselyest this was absolutey good match but that all it was just a good match sure hbk carried that is the point hbk carried it disel did not do 0 to 2 % work excpet for that noteworthy powerbomb that highlight the wwe intro shows for years it would have been nice if disel did a little more work may be this match would have be an ultimate classic if it had a special gimmick hardcore match then this match probably would have been four stars or more but since it was a regular match i have to give it ***1/2_***3/4 i wanted to give this match even four stars but disel was just too freakin slow in the ring despite hbk bump like tennis ball all over the ring this match i will agree with some about this match being one of the best one manshow performers in sports entertainment
3,No Fear: A Police Officer's Perspective,I did not expect this book to be an advocate for childhood spankings. The book is well written.
1,the truth,i think this cd is not too bad but i would buy this cd just for that song words powers and sound by mecchak i would like to buy some mecchak music how can i link him.
1,Ripoff,"I paid 18 bucks for this book and all it is ,is about 10 pages of a preacher/teacher guy lecturing and the rest is just several pages of occult themed pictures all in drawn black and white.The pictures were cool, but the book was in no way worth what I paid for it.If you truly want it, try to find a decent used copy as cheaply as you can."
2,Heard it before,"The title got me really exited and, consequently, extremely disappointed after hearing the conventional and extremely market driven sound emanating from the disc. It SOUNDS really great.....it just doesn't say anything that hasn't been said before, musically or lyrically."
4,Same chocks as the race Ramps Part# RR-WC-1,"The dimensions are the same, except the ones made for Race Ramps has five slits on the bottom. I don't know it that matters that much, but these are 1/3 cheaper at Nothern Tools, even after sales tax."
2,Size matters,"The sizing is on the small side, should have paid attention to the detailed description"
5,Excellent Ride,"The overall acting shines in this epic story of the Canadian biker gang era. The show is about a broken friendship and trust set against the backdrop of Harleys, power, and corruption. I bought this years ago, have watched it several times, and highly recommend it."
3,OK,I was expecting more riding and was a little bored during the first 2 parts. The last two parts were much better. The overall story line was more like the Sopranos or something. It's just a typical story line of what some people conceive about motorcycle clubs.
5,Greek Drama on Wheels,"You don't have to be particularly interested in bikers to enjoy this mini-series. The plot is complex, with well-developed central characters. The script is top-notch and the cast is uniformly excellent. It's a tragedy that starts playing out its inevitable outcome from the very first episode. Greed, the lust for power, and revenge all play a part in moving its main characters, played by Michael Ironside and Roy Dupuis, to their bitter destinies."
5,Great Veiwing ! Sopranos on Wheels !,"I had a very poor quality VHS home made copy of The Last Chapter that I bought in the late 90's and it was very hard to watch. It was taped by a Canadian off the television . It was just recently released in the US on DVD and I ordered it right away ! It is a story of a large motorcycle club that is taking in smaller clubs to expand. The new leader is not really a biker but a yuppie who takes up golf and drives an expensive sports car. He is a killer and sits on top of a large drug business . This show sucks you in , I actually like it better than Sons of Anarchy . It is like the Sopranos on Wheels and is much more realistic than some other biker shows . I give it three thumbs up !"
5,"There Should be a Disclaimer: ""Based on True Events""","This was either a series or mini-series for CBC and is a dramatization of the so-called""biker wars""between the HA's and (apparently)every other club in Canada.The rip-off of the clubs is obvious, right down the ""Triple-Sixer's"" red & white colors and the""Los Matadores'""red and gold. The similarities are so blatant that the Matadores don't sport an M/C patch. If you watch closely, you'll see that their patch reads, MG - motorcycle gang, just like the Bandido's did at one point in the 70's.This series is hard-core and makes theSons of Anarchylook like a bunch of boy scouts. There is little sympathetic in any of the characters, especially Michael Ironsides who plays the main protagonist of the series, Bob Durelle. Durelle is obviously based on the life ofWalter Stadnick.If you've any interest in the history or culture of the biker phenomenon, this series should definitely be part of your collection."
3,surprisingly sweet,"I am not a fan of country music, but I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this CD. The music and the lyrics are simple, heartfelt, and sincere, and I found myself relating to many of the issues and emotions that Nancy writes about. In particular, ""Even You"" and ""Just About Now"" touch on the poignant emotions of lost love and moving on. ""Just About Now"" has a stirring, rich piano melody that will stick in your head for hours. My favorite track is ""Rita"", which details the rich character of the song's namesake and displays Nancy's vocal strength the most markedly. There could have been more instrumentation -- the fiddle/violinist did a wonderful job and I wish there would have been more of it. I recommend this CD for anyone who enjoys traditional country or folk music and definately for any woman who has ever loved and lost."
3,Works but.....,"This product seems to do what its supposed to, namely help your stomach and intestines. But do not try as directed. Its a chewable, and upon chewing you will realize this is the worst tasting chewable, ever. They are pretty big tablets, round, and I try taking them by swallowing directly, instead of chew, but careful, because they could lodge in your throat. And if your serious about this product dont forget to take these 20 minutes before a meal, it does really help. In the end I will never get these again. I will look for a better way to take this, like a pill. I appreciate that they work, but make them taste good, or make them non chewable."
5,no more prescription prevacid,these work great. i was on prevacid and still getting an acid stomach and now i just take these a few times a day and i am good.
1,Not helpful,"I saw the glowing reviews so I purchased this along with mastic gum. The combo made my stomache pain and acid reflux worse than I thought possible. It took about ten days after I stopped using the products before the pain and reflux settled back into normal, mind numbing pain. It could be that this is only right for people with h. pylori, I don't know."
2,Like a Placebo,"i've taken this product before in the past and trying again now. my results are the same. it's like taking a placebo and does nothing for me, at least nothing i can feel. now, if it actually is healing my ulcers on the inside without me knowing it, then i'd say it's a great product, but i still had an ulcer (or it came back) after i took it before in the past. i'm only trying it again now because my ulcer has gotten worse and i have nothing to lose by trying. maybe my ulcer is too chronic and/or severe but i havne't noticed any difference taking this. as for the taste, it's not bad at all, even in sugar-free form. products like this may work for some people but not others. doesn't work for me."
2,Maybe helps temporarily...,"I don't really notice much of an improvement with these, although I don't take them all that often either - so I guess it's hard to say..."
3,No Help for reflux or GERD,"Recommended by Dr Oz, I took this product as perscribed hoping it would allow me to discontinue one of my prescriptions taken for Acid Reflux and GERD. I noticed NO difference and should not have wasted my money. Perhaps it can help someone else, but it sure didn't do anything for me"
1,Low potency.,"Each tablet has a lower potency of DGL than some other brand's offerings. That means you have to chew up a lot more of these things to get the desired effect. I personally don't like the taste of licorice, so I would rather not have to chew up more than I need to, so I went back to using Natural Factors DGL."
4,Really Works,I have Acid Reflux and was looking for a natural product. I tried it and it worked. I also take 1oz of Aloe Vera juice every morning. The combination works well.
3,Taste like molasses without the sugar,"Chocolate gives me headaches, otherwise I would give the German Chocolate a try. I'm pretty tolerant of foul-tasting things and get a taste for licorice once in awhile, so I was skeptical that the foul taste would be as bad as people say. The flavor is like molasses without the sugar and more of the bitterness. I think I might get used to it, but we shall see. I'm trying this for Crohn's Disease and IBS, haven't noticed much of a difference after a week and 1/2 of a bottle."
2,doesnt taste the same as before,The taste of this DGL is very anise it was not like this before not sure if this is not real.
1,YUCK licorice taste,"I purchased this to help heal an ulcer that I fight. As I am also trying to lose weight I went with the sugarless version versus the flavored one. NO WHERE did it give any description of what it would taste like. If you can't stand the taste of licorice, DON'T BUY THIS. This was wasted money for me. I will give the flavored ones a try and hope they are not steeped in the same taste."
5,Real good,"This record is real good. The other was also good as well. Anyone who say that the songs on here aren't so good is probably from mainstreem culture. They don't know house at all and they don't know rinocerose. I got my first CD in phillipines, but it has different cover. I have listened to the band for a long time and won't be sick of them, ever. They're not any more ""predictable"" than any other electronic music. Good stuff. Buy it as well as their olde record,"
3,Download first,"This is like if an indie rock band dabbled in house music, and that is a very good thing. The only reason I'm not giving this four stars is the addition of flutes, which make some of the songs sound like the [stuff] they play on the weather channel. Also, some of the singing and lyrics are cheesy as ... They should have sung in french instead.You should check out Felix Da Houscat's remix of ""Lost Love"" I'm not sure what record it's on."
2,Another One Bites the Dust . . .,"I was so excited for this release . . . Installation Sonore was so gorgeous. There is potential in the last third of the album, but otherwise it has too much drum and bass, too many vocals, is too driven, too predictable, and too ambitious. Oh well . . . maybe next time."
3,"not bad, but...","If you liked their first CD you'll probably like this one as well, so go ahead and pick it up. But as a few other reviewers have said, it lacks the magic of their amazing first album. Several of the tracks fall flat on their face, with the title track being downright embarassing. Fortunately several of the tracks like Professeur Suicide make me want to get up and dance, so this CD will see a lot of time in the CD player when I'm driving, but not much else."
2,Sophomore jinx!!,"Disappointing follow-up to their amazing first album. The tracks are full of energy and have the same basic 'sound' of their first album but lack the same inspiration and direction. The quality of the song craftsmanship has diminished while the over-glossy production quality goes up a notch. A few songs flirt with 70s disco and are fairly nauseating, and a few uninspired 'rock' songs feature a ridiculously bad vocalist (and equally sappy lyrics). One or two tracks are very good but most are simply adequate, but there's really nothing here that makes you stand back and take notice. The first album was great because of all of the unexpected twists and turns it took, this one fails because it lacks dynamics, takes few chances and settles on being safe and overly repetitious."
3,Rinérse '- Music Kills Me,"Rinérse returns for a second round of rock-house-pop (with flutes!) on MUSIC KILLS ME. And right from ""Le Rock Summer,"" you hear some disco being thrown in the mix, a nod to the much-vaunted 'French touch' of the late 90s, while the title track and ""Dead Flowers"" pump up the rock elements. ""Lost Love"" has a catchy soul-pop chorus, but it doesn't work quite as well on ""Resurrection D'une Idole Pop."" But the groove and sax squelches on ""Professeur Suicide"" stands up well on its own, as does the melodic retort to Jimi Hendrix, ""No, We Are Not Experienced!"" They enter more downtempo territory with ""Brian Jones: Last Picture"" and ""Obseques D'un Guitar Hero,"" though they overdo the guitars on the latter (much better is the simpler ""Highway To Heaven."") But the jazz-tinged bossa nova of ""Dead Can Dance"" help make up for any lapses. A nice, if inconsistent album."
4,Travis McGee territory,"The Mick Callahan we met in ""Memorial Day"" was self-absorbed and arrogant at times, and just learning to care about other people. Still, he was already a fascinating character. Well, Mick has grown tremendously here, as the series steps boldly into Travis McGee territory. Young Callahan has become an introspective knight in rusty aromor, a wry philosopher of a man with opinions and what seems like a genetic taste for violence. The two books are best read in order, although 'Eye of the Burning Man' also stands on its own well enough. Snappy dialogue, lots of action, really fun read."
1,Not as advertised,"Extremely poor quality, even for a cheap cup.Not drip-free as pictured, and the vent hole is positioned too close to center, making it difficult to spray with the cup more than half full."
5,Most Advanced notebook on the Market,"My purpose in buying a notebook was to run Microsoft Flight Simulator X exclusively.At the time of my purchase, this is the only notebook available with the NVidia GeForce 8700M GT graphics card. This incredible machine has everything I could think of cramming into a notebook, including a subwoofer. It out-performs most of the $4000 Dell and AlienWare notebooks without even heating up. It's 3DMark06 score is 5089.The bottom line is that Flight Simulator X runs on Ultra High settings at 30FPS. All of the other features speak for themselves."
3,Change the Geforce fast!,"This computer like the others is cool BUUUUTTTT! the have a deadly BAD BUILD GEFORCE!Change it for another (ATI, whathever...) and get the extension of security from TOSHIBA!See more infos at "" [...]""...See the hole site for tips!"
1,TOSHIBA X205 laptops,"I strongly don't recommend this laptop for those who wish to buy this kind.I am very disappointed with it's performance particularly with it's HD-DVD drive. I have not been using frequently the drive but after a year and a month it just totally non-functional. And Toshiba service center refused to offer warranty and they are charging me 500 US dollars for the drive including service fee. I think this product line did not meet my expectation when it comes to reliability,quality and performance wise. Beware of this notebook PC quality you will just be upset in buying this product. I am really frustrated in buying this laptop."
3,Which model is being rated?,"I have read the reviews and find it interesting that the reviews for two machines are all listed for both models. If the $400 difference means anything there should be a distinction between the reviews.I bought a X205-S9349 and am stunned at how big Vista is. The unit I bought had problems out of the box and I have yet to resolve them. This is too bad, as I need a working machine immediately. Vista takes a LONGGGGG time to boot, so trying to determine the problem has eaten most of my Saturday and I still have no idea what the issue is."
1,Piece of *%$#,I bought one at Wal-Mart for half price and two days later I am looking for a different one. Don't waste your time.
2,Unconvinced,"not convinced this was worth the $3 we spent on it at Wal-Mart. (We're now hunting for a different one.)Holes in the bottom of the outer bowl mean that you have to use it in the sink or some other place that can collect water, rather than sitting it on the countertop while spinning.Often when you put on the lid the gears don't mesh so that the handle either won't turn at all or it turns slowly and off-kilter.Assigned this 2 stars rather than 1 because my husband doesn't mind carefully lining up the gears and therefore was only bothered by the holes in the bottom."
5,2 songs make it five stars,"those being Young and Insane and Alien Being, which are as life-changing as anything the Magnetics have done, and that's saying a lot. The other 3 tunes are pleasant enough but unspectacular in my opinion. This is a must-have for any Fields fan or collector of sublimely depressing pop perfection."
3,all too brief,"Despite this ep having 5 songs, the playing time barely manages 12 minutes - not good value at the price. The songs, of course, are up to the usual Merritt standard, but it would have been better value for money if he'd included them on another of his albums (stylistically, there's not much to differentiate them from his other works). For avid fans only."
2,Disappointing,"Angelika Kirchschlager's mezzo voice is very fine, but one can hardly tell from listening to these duets---she's drowned out by Barbara Bonney's big soprano voice, too-big vibrato, and too-frequent pitch difficulties (usually on the sharp side). It's a shame. Many of these songs are heard infrequently. But this is not the way to hear them. Perhaps Bonney plus a stronger mezzo voice would have been better. Personally I would have preferred Kirchschlager paired with a soprano who's on pitch and less closely miked."
4,Back Home in Galway,Jack Taylor the misfit alcholic former Guard is back in Galway after a short stint in London. He gets hired by Sweeper to look into the murders of some Tinkers as the Guards will not look into the murders. From there we are back in the dark world of Jack Taylor the alcoholic who seems to push away everyone who does or might care about him. Despite his self destructive behaviour there is a lingering hope that Jack Taylor can be saved. Very snappy and witty dialogue and a very interesting and dark character that Ken Bruen is developing in Jack Taylor.
2,Bad Cover,This Album is icked. Why would u have a picture of Marvin playing golf on the front cover. There is no need for him to be huffily slanting like that.Three great tracks:Gangsta's ParadiseJump AroundWalk This Way
1,Be Careful,"Be careful. This is the reduced-size version. The full-size version, such as the one I purchased in 1975, is very difficult to find."
2,Get the original,"This book is a photocopy of a handwritten manuscript where the original size was already somewhat small, so in the reduced size harder to read. Amazon sells a reprint of the original atKonkordanz Zum Hebraischen Alten Testament/ Concordance to the Hebrew Old Testament (German Bible Society Hebrew Edition)The difference in legibility is worth the slight difference in price.The reason I rated it at two stars is because of the content."
2,this fixture kid is not quite suitable for remodelling,"I bought 9 of this, prepared to spend 2-3 hours to install all of them, by the end of a day, I spent 8 hours to install only 4 of them. This kid is not really good fit for remodelling. the problem is that once the remodeling clips are installed, there is no enough room for the housing to be pushed up at all. I wonder whether the manufacturer ever tested this kind of installation. the description of installation is hard to read as well."
3,"Good plugs, bad plastic","The AC ADAPTER plug and link plug were the only useful things in this package. It isn't officially made by Nintendo, but it still works good with the GameBoy Color. The plastic is cheap, the light thingy breaks too easily, believe me. I like how you can match the color to your gameboy also. This kits was my first PELICAN product, and I'm glad to see they've come up with better stuff since then. :) Good for the plugs, but bad for the lights and stuff."
1,Breaks so easily,"Product realy is bad breaks even if you just use it one or two times especally the screen light and protecter, get yourself a better one"
2,POOR PRODUCTION.,"I have seen this play on stage and it was very funny. Live theater has an energy that movies can't seem to capture but this production was disappointing. It was miscast, the actors did not fit the parts and either they were tired or the director was depressed because there was no fun nor energy to match the dialogue. The play was also poorly filmed and the sound quality is pitiful which could be forgiven if the play had been better performed."
3,good and lurid,Thought I recognized Landsdale's name and found this book. I read it fourteen years ago and remembered it had plenty of upfront horror and humor. Good for when you are in a rotten mood and need to read something about people who deserve a bad end.
4,Good stuff,Shame amazon has it for so much. Good product but I'd recommend a local supermarket.I use this for chicken tamales all the time.DON'T USE WATER.Mix a few* tablespoons with a small can of tomato sauce. It really tames it and tastes much better.
4,needs suggestions,"This sauce is OK, but you have doc it up to make it your own. It would have been helpful if they gave recipe suggestions or a website to get recipes. Larger print would have been nice too."
1,DOA,"got tv 10-25-07tv was DOA.Called the tv shop samsung said to call.They picked up the tv a week later,todayie 11-19-07 and i am still waiting for the TV.HELP!!!!!Harvey Brown"
3,Really Disapointed,"I do not own one of these, but I finally found one to look at at Circuit City. Based on all of these glowing reviews I would have bought one, but after seeing one in action there is no way I would get one.I like the idea of the LED light engine, but the viewing angle was horible.I was terribly disappointed by what I saw compared to other DLP sets."
5,GREAT TV,"We purchased this set after doing alot of research. You can not beat this price and the picture that you get. We had a 1080i before and we thought we had a great picture then. We now look at our old set in the game room and think oh my gosh look at what we were missing. Bought a hd dvd player also for this tv, we have watched alot of old movies and it is like seeing them for the first time. Everything is so clear, you notice things you have missed in your favorite movies!!!!"
5,A winner!,"I have been looking to replace my Sceptre LCD TV that has failed for the second time, deciding upon Sammy's HLT-xx87 if I could find one for a decent price. This 5687 from Amazon's subsidiary, warehouse_deals, is a wonderful TV. A 50"" unit would have been fine but I got pushed into a larger size by a friend. I have no complaints, other than dust clinging to the bezel. But I can't say anything about its up-converting abilities as hasn't been explored yet."
2,Would Be 1 Star If Picture Quality Wasn't Good Sometimes!,"Tv is alright when I don't see the rainbow ""Halo"" prism on the lower center of my screen. Called where I got it from and they say it's normal for NEWER DLP's to do this. I say well if the salesman would have told me that do you think I would have bought this tv they say no and then tell me it falls into a tolerance level and I have to tolerate it....Stay away from Samsung DLP's actually stay away from DLP's all together!!!!"
2,Great while it lasted - 2.5 years and no color red.,"This was my 2nd HDTV, the first being a rear projection unit. The picture was sharp and beautiful from July, 2007 up until January, 2010 at which point the red LED burned out. Researching this online while staring at a blue-green picture I found that this make and model of Samsung has this problem ALL THE TIME.In fact, I got pretty lucky that it lasted 2.5 years. Some folks have this happen after just 12, 15 or 18 months.The red LED can be obtained for around $100 but there's a 4 week backorder on it. Something tells me that's another indication how common the problem is. I could buy a light engine for $1000 but that would be throwing another grand at a set that still has a weak red LED."
5,Simply Awesome Picture,"I was a little leary about buying a big ticket item online. However, the delivery service Amazon uses was very good. The TV settings out of the box were ok but with a little tweaking you can get an amazing picture. Sporting events and gaming are freaking unreal! You won't be disappointed."
2,Customer service problems,"Let me start out by saying the TV is great. However, it arrived with problems with the screen (dark smugged areas). We alerted Samsung to this issue and they gave use a warrenty repair company to come out to fix it. They came out to see if it could be repaired in place and found the screens needed to be replaced. They ordered the new screens 3 months ago. The repair company was blaming Samsung and Samsung had no idea why the screens were not delivered, until today. Come to find out the repair company had lost there licenses to repair Samsung awhile back. We were never contacted by Samsung to tell us that the dropping of the service company had happened and to get us a new repair service company to come back out. If you have issues with Samsung you will want to immediately talk to the Executive Customer Relations (ECR) branch. The regular customer service folks don't have the power to do anything except take notes and put you on hold for ""2 to 3 minutes"". Just beware."
5,Samsung Wins Again,"Samsung has always led in the DLP field and this television does not disappoint. The screen is huge and the picture is incredible. There are tons of menu options to tweak your picture until you're satisfied. I have an HD Cable Box running through HDMI, and Xbox 360 running through the PC input, and a Wii running through component. The cable and 360 are absolutely stunning. Watching Planet Earth in 1080p on this set will knock your socks off.My favorite feature of this set is the fact that all of the inputs are on the side and very easy to reach and there are a ton of them. 3 HDMI, 2 Component, 2 Composite, VGA, and an optical audio out. The only downside of having the inputs on the side is that they are difficult to hide and the way our living room is set up makes them clearly visible.This is my second Samsung HDTV and I'm sure that my third (which I don't plan on getting any time soon) will be too."
5,"Great TV, Fast Shipping!",First off I received the TV 5 days before the estimated delivery date! The TV works great and has an excellent picture. I was a little worried about the viewing angle but it is not a problem at all. TV starts up quick and how VERY rich blacks. The best part is I never have to worry about the bulb going out.The only thing is when I use remotes other than the manufacturer's to change the input it takes a whole min to remove the Input HUD. Using the Samsung remote you can change the input and press Enter to make the HUD go away. A very minor problem for such a great price though!
4,Great HDTV and best deal for it is on Amazon!,"I've owned this set for about 3 weeks now and it is incredible. I thought I would hire Firedog for $99 to do the calibration, etc. but then I said I would see how it looks first - it is awesome right out of the box! You MUST use hdmi cable for the absolute best picture and sound. Oh, and I bought $5 hdmi cables right from an Amazon supplier and they are just fine. The sound is much better than everyone says when you use hdmi.On this big set sports are incredible, you feel like you are out there with them, lol. The remote is easy to work with and you can change screen size with one button. The regular channels have a gray bar on the sides which is lousy but when you change the screen size to 'wide-screen-fit' it looks decent.The hdtv channels are where the fun is, the travel channel, sports, music is just terrific. I'm sure my cable co will keep adding stations and I can't wait for more!"
5,Coolest thing I ever bought,"I bought this TV from Amazon.com 2 months ago. It was the cheapest I found anywhere and the shipping was hassle free (real quick too, like 3 days)I love it, HD channels are unbelievable, bright and crisp. Also, it has a great side-to-side viewing angle, I can watch from the loveseat just as clearly as from the couch directly in front. The only problem I can find with this TV is the vertical viewing angle, if your sitting on the floor or standing up the screen kind of washes out.I can't say too much for durability, however, a major factor in my purchase was the LED light engine. We'll see how it turns out.Sound is sound, you don't buy a big screen HDTV for the sound.Bottom line, unless you HAVE to hang your TV on the wall, get this one."
5,Resolved problem immediately-Great experience,"HDTV picture is beautiful. Original one came and had a ""bad spot"", called Amazon and it was taken care of immediately. Brand new one delivered within a week and old one picked up. Programming was easy but will purchase an upconverting DVD player as my DVD picture & sound isn't nearly as clear as the HDTV stations. I am a very satisfied Amazon customer and would recommend purchases products from them. Customer Service is outstanding and you can't beat the price. The price of the TV even dropped in price by $40. within 30 days and I sent an email and my account was credited within a couple of days."
1,DO NOT BUY,I have had this t.v for 2 years now. I have never had a problem with it in that time. It wanted this t.v and it sounded great that it was and LED t.v and would require no bulb changes. Then while watching t.v my screen turned blue and green. The red was completely gone. I called Samsung and the only help they provided was to get me to a service tech in my area to service the t.v. They now are asking for 1200 to fix the red chip in my t.v. That is half the cost of the product. I started doing some research and it seems to be a common problem with this product. If I had it to do again I would have choose something else.
5,Amazon price and delivery,"Perfect experience with all aspects of price and delivery. saved $800 buy not buying from circuit city. delivery from eagle was excellent, they sent 2 men and arrived on time and unpacked and setup and cleaned up. as for the tv its hooked up to dtv hd and the picture is just perfect. very little tweaking. all picture sizes are automatic. the qam tuner also gets all my hd locals over cable(we have free basic in our community). Amazon also has a 30 day price guarantee just call them if the price goes down and they credit your card, so far i received a $125.00 credit. great experience."
4,"Samsung 56""DLP","This TV is awesome! Picture is crisp, clear,& beautiful. Easy to follow set-up and controls. I would highly recommend this TV to most anyone. Our set-up is the problem not the TV. Dislike limited viewing angle (other reviews say around 100 degrees) for our very small room. DLP best if set at visual(eye)height. We need to have it a little higher again because of our room limits.Ours has a defective port on side but Amazon is returning easily. Delivery was perfect."
5,Very pleased,We are very pleased with this purchase as we purchased it without seeing one. We were unable to locate this item in our town. We were told by people at BB and CC they were going to get one but never did. We read many reviews on a lot of TV's and really liked this one. Deliver was great. Our advise to everyone is don't be afraid to make adjustments to meet your viewing preference. It's not hard to do. Enjoy it. HD ROCK'S.Can't wait for more HD from Directv.
5,Excellent TV,"I've had this TV for 2 months now and it has been great. Great picture and sound. Delivery company was fast, courteous and professional."
5,"Great Product, fast Shipment, good Customer Service. What more could you ask for?","Wow this thing is just awsome. When I first ordered it and heard the company shipped it via cargo I anticipated having to wait MONTHS in receiving it but in actuality it took less than a full week. After getting it delivered it hooked up with ease and the picture is just awsome. 1080i and the new digital tv stations is just out of this world. Like any other format change we've encountered (tapes to CD's, VCR tapes to DVDs, regular tv to Digital) I expected little or no difference but now I'm super glad the government's forcing the switch over. This TV needs no receiver or anything to receive the digital tv and I'd recommend it to anyone."
3,Most Beautiful 10 minutes of my life,Picture was beautiful until the delivery guy drove out of my driveway when the screen turned green and the picture died. Had to unplug it to get it to turn off. The good news is that I chose Amazon as a retailer and since it was DOA on arrival they gave me my money back and had someone pickup the TV. in short I got a lemon. The product looks great for a good number of people. But if you get a lemon I suggest returning it through Amazon instead of dealing with the support hassles others have had.
1,.45x wide angle is OK - 2.2x is terrible,"2.2x telephoto does not have focus definition and has light refraction. The picture with original lens is much, much better.I really do not recommend."
1,Died in one day,"Opened the box, unpacked, plugged in the power supply and attached the Toslink optical cable after checking for light output. Connected the RCA jacks for my headphones and it worked fine. Used it all that night so wife could sleep while I watched TV. Tried next night and the unit was dead, dead, dead!!! Sending it back."
2,Better off with other titles,"The author has done a fairly good job in explaning the decision process behind his pictures but the book suffers throughly from poor pagination. Sections and themes (such as landscapes, colour, urban landcapes, etc.) that clearly appear to be distinct in the author's mind are all messed up... Composition is not discussed. The only lesson you learn from this book is to drop a Wratten 81A + polarizer in front of your lens before shooting."
5,This book is awesome!,Hi! My name is Lisa and I am 11 years old. I just bought this book and I could'nt put it down! It covers practicly every question about B-rok that you could ever imagine! If I were you I would go out and buy this book right away!
5,An Excellent Inside Look on the BSB!,"When I first heard about Samantha's book I figured it was going to be a tell all book about her and Brian's relationship. Then when I saw it in the store I flipped through it and decided to check it out, I was very happy I did in the end! Samantha's book gives BSB fans a great inside look on how being a BSB girlfriend would really be like and she also shows what the guys are really like. Instead of being angry at Samantha, she's made me like the BSB even more after reading this! I congratulate her on an excellent book and to all the fans that think she was hurting Brian by writing this..check out the book and you'll see just how wrong you were!"
5,"Wow, what can I say!","First of all, this is a fabulous book and I totally recommend it to ALL BSB fans, it's jam-packed with cool facts and BSB trivia!Samantha did a great job with the book and although many people think the book is disrespectful to Brian and she's just trying to get money, it's nothing like that!It's a really fun book, and the setup is great, it's written as a Q&A book which is a really great idea and the questions are just 'what you wanna know', as the title suggests!There is a picture section in the middle, which is one of the best bits, there's some real cute early BSB/Brian pix! Bri and Samantha made such a sweet couple! Basically I give this book a HUGE thumbs up and i recomend it to EVERYONE!"
4,"New, True Facts",What You Wanna Know...is the best book that any true BSB fan could read. These are the real facts told by someone that was actually there. These aren't stories that someone researched or made up. This true life and a great interesting book. The topics are covered in a mature fashion and acceptable for all ages. I wasn't sure how I felt about this book before it was released. Now I am so happy that I bought it. Samantha did a great job of telling fans what we want to know while still keeping certain things private. A great book that all true fans should read.
2,A little unpleased!,"I read the book and found it satisfying. It didn't give out all of Brian's personal secrets, and no embarassing or private pictures were published. The thing that gets to me is the contest she is having with it. If my boyfriend would have given me his gold record, the one he shed tears over, I wouldn't give it to anyone, let alone a stranger who wins a contest! I feel like I know Brian now, but I still wish I wouldn't have bought the book."
3,Not a bad book,"I enjoyed this book, mostly. It gave some interesting information that any Backstreet Boys fan would like to know. However I found that the book was written at a level appealing to most of the younger fans. There is nothing wrong with this of course, but I thought that the book could have sounded so much more sophisticated if she had written on a higher level. Also, she kept putting in these little social messages like ""stay in school,"" etc., which I thought killed some of the book's potential. All in all, though, I thought the book was good and it did give some good information that I didn't know before about the boys. However, it's not something that I would recommend you rush out and buy... unless you're just dying to know everything about the boys, which I was. =)"
5,I want to be a backstreet girlfriend!,I think this is a must read book that I could not put down! Yes it shows that the backstreet boys are real boys!Does it say ugly things NO! You learn alot about the boys and it's real and fun. I think Samantha does a great job in this book of answering the questions we all want to know without getting to personal which I'm sure she could have since she was with Brian for 4 years! If you don't buy this book it will be your loss!
1,This is awful!,"If any of you guys have been to brian and aj's offical site's you see a banner that says ""Support Brian and Aj, Don't buy the books."" That's their personal life that they trusted people with it and this girl just goes and spills everything it's so wrong and TRUE FANS won't buy the book!"
1,The definition of being way out of line in the fullest.,"Brian didn't deserve this. Having actually met him, I know that he's quite a remarkable person. He and Leighanne have been happily married for just over a decade now and have a son who has got to be one of the coolest ten-year-olds in the world. He's a respectable and devout husband and father, and is by far not the kind of ex- that should be trashed like this. Samantha, you should be ashamed."
1,SUCKED!!!!,"Aweful! I guess I'm just too old for the BSB. No, I still love their music but this chick is so full of herself!"
1,make that negative 1 star,"I haven't read this book and I most certainly do not plan on reading it. Samantha Stonebraker is a coniving, money-hungry insult to the beauty that is Brian Littrell. I can't believe that this woman would sink so low as to try to make a few dollars off of an ex's success. This personally to Samantha: You are sick and twisted and I seriously hope you get what you deserve for exploiting Brian and the rest of the guys. Get a life."
1,Just wrong!!,"Actually, I give this zero stars, but it won't actually let me do that.The first thing that I have to mention is that I have never read this book, and I never plan to. But I think that the concept is absolutley disgusting. The excerpt from the back of the book made me want to throw up. Which of them are still virgins? That's really personal, and she has no right to be writing a book about that. If she ever really cared about Brian, and the other BSB, she wouldn't be writing a book about their secrets. If you really are a true fan, you wouldn't buy this book so you could read about all of their secrets. You would not buy it, because it is a total invasion of their privacy."
5,Super quality photos,I cannot believe the photo quality this camera produces. The color and detail is perfect. I am having a lot of fun with this camera. I will definetly buy another Fuji camera. I will get one with zoom next time.
5,Perfect,"Perfect! Thats the best way to describe this camera. Like most adults I know I was technologically impaired so to speak. Then I got this as a gift. This is a fact, i didn't use my old camera again. This thing is amazing. It isn't to high tech, nor is it to pricy. This camera has only 2 drawbacks, and one of those can be fixed. The first is that although it seems light, once you put in the smartmedia card and the 4 AA batteries it becomes quite heavy. The other drawback is that if you regular baatteries it will finsh them before you know it. But that can be fixed easily by buying rechargable batteries. Other than that this camera is great. It changed the way i took pictures forever. And it is very first-timer friendly. All in all buy this camera, it doesn't get much better than this!!"
1,Very Poor! Spots on all pictures with flash,"All of the pictures I take with the flash have lots of light spots on them. The company seemed well aware of this problem, and told me it is reflections of dust particles in the air - bull. I returned the camera and got another Fuji 2300, but it does the same thing. Don't buy this!"
4,An excellent reference,"If you are a new member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, this book could be indispensible. It goes above and beyond to explain a lot about the LDS Church's organization at every level. It does not say much about doctrine, so if you are investigating the LDS Church this is not the book for you. At the end of every chapter, the authors answer common questions from converts, which is also very helpful."
2,Not Much Substance,"I go this book as a gift and figured it deserved a read. It's not a horrible book, but it doesn't have much in it. More motivation than advice, the entire book could be summed up by saying ""get off your ass and get to work"", only then the author wouldn't have made millions off a few weeks (being very generous here) worth of work.It's not the worst thing I've ever read, but if you're looking for help or a gift, I would continue your search."
5,"Easy read, helped me achieve goals","I love this book! Helps you narrow down all your ""wants"" to what you really want and make these your true goals... The magic of this is, that once you know what you want and list it you start making your desires a reality."
1,Don't waste you money,I have blackheads and I was really hoping that this would be the answer! I even steamed my face and did all of that before going in and using it. I felt like when I used it it made it worse by making a huge indent and not getting any blackheads out!
3,It's ok..,"The book has a wealth of information, but in my opinion, jumps around too much.The author will explain something, and tell you to run a command, but then state that you currently have not learned what the command will do, and that it is covered 6 chapters from now.The book doesn't flow either. It covers lot of things, but in a ""by the way"" fashion.As I said, the book has a wealth of information, but for a beginner like me, it is a little hard to grasp."
4,Wonderful Fragrance at a Great Price,"I first found and bought this cologne at a men's suit store years ago and loved it, but didn't want to spend so much for it again when I ran out. I was thrilled to find it at HALF the price the clothier sells it for. And it comes in very attractive, clever packaging."
4,Smells nice,I bought another cologne and got this as a sample. I must say it smelled better than the one I bought and lasts longer as well. It smells somewhat as a mixture between GIO and Polo fragrances. I think I'm going to order a 3.4 ounce soon as this smells really nice.
3,It smells different than I was told.,"This doesn't have that fresh spring smell I was looking for, it has more of a strong spice smell. It doesn't match me so I don't wear it. Plus, it doesn't last more than an hour before fading quickly."
1,Painfully boring and inaccurate.,Well a thorough waste of time and paper remedied only by good decision to stop self-inflicted injury to brain cells by putting it down. Give me a real historian please rather than PC drivel.
2,Several hundred pages of fluff...,"If you have no idea what you're doing get this book. It does a good job of summarizing the apps in SBS. If you want hard core, real-world examples and tips look somewhere else...if I knew where I'd tell ya."
2,"Color it yellow.... and rename it ""SBS for Dummies""",If you are having troubles connecting to your ISP and MS Support has worn you out.... DO NOT make the mistake of thinking that this book will have information that will assist you in resolving your problems..... On the other hand the book does offer some intresting explanations of other various networking issues....
2,a rehash of basics,"Microsoft Backoffice Small Business Server Bible adds little to the online documentation provided with the Microsoft Backoffice Small Business Server. I purchased it as soon as it came out because of questions I had administering the software in my office network. The questions had not been answered by the online resources on Small Business Server. Rather than the MS SBS ""Bible"", I'd say it belonged in the ""Dummies"" group of books."
3,Good for the end user.,This book will be helpful for an end user or an inexperienced administrator but it does not cover any advanced topics and most of it can be found in the on-line help in SBS.
5,perfect - the madeleines pop right out!,The pans are so easy to use - simple to clean and the madeleines pop out looking and tasting delightful!
4,Parodies,"If you enjoy hearing someone making fun of the Government and Stars mistakes, the Capitol Steps are for you. Using well known tunes and alternate wording they make fun of most of the stupidity in the world."
3,"Blair ""Bitchy"" Project","This movie-although very amusing, and fun to watch, was a one hour thirty minute video of T&A and a bunch of arguing from some annoying high pitched girls. I wouldn't reccomend this movie to a few of my friends, yet then again a few would probaly enjoy it."
1,I can't believe that these people watched the same video!,"This was without a doubt the dumbest video that I've ever seen! I am a frequent viewer of soft porn/playboy, and I can't tell you how bad this thing was. It is not only mistitled (SERIOUSLY lacking in any bare people) but there was no action! There was no attempt to match up with the cinematic style or feel of the original and only resembled the Blair Witch Project in the name and use of a map at some point in the movie. I would STRONGLY reccomend that you go somewhere else for your action and resist the urge of listening to the other reviewers that probably produced or acted in the movie."
3,Kinky and Fun,"I'm kind of a fan of Lorissa McCommas and Nikki Fritz and I fell in love with this film's naughty lampoon of the Blair Witch Project. Nice little lesbian scenes (made funny by the constant, eager groaning of the only male participant of the group, Lunk, who holds the camera. ""Can I join in?"" / ""No way, this is a girl thing."" Hehe.) Funny out-takes during the end credits. Cameo by B-movie goddess Julie Strain as the Bare Wench.Just a fun movie, with nudity and light-hearted sexual situations and of course, lots of bouncing around and about as mindless as the movie it spoofs. But at least ""Bare Wench"" is FUN.I just can't believe Nikki Fritz reviewed her own movie here at Amazon. I'M A FAN! XOXO :-)"
4,Hot Movie,"Ok, now we know this isn't an oscar winner but its not often we get a sexy movie with beautiful ladies that is actually kind of funny. The plot isn't all that great but the ladies more than make up for it. Very erotic film that makes you want to watch it over and over. I never wanted to be ""lunk"" so badly. If you've seen the movie, you know what I mean"
3,"Accurate spoof, acting typical of strippers","While an accurate spoof of the Blair Witch Project, there are some other things that made this movie quite funny. For example, the inconsistencies in scene, one minute they're at Yosemite in the woods, the next on somebody's backyard lawn making out. Only one of the girls has any acting ability at all, or for that matter any brains, the rest are typical airheads. One of them is so bad, at the end you can watch her screw up a 10 word line she's supposed to say over and over again, a true monument to her stupidity. Definetly amusing."
3,THe bare wench project,"i really wasnt expecting to like this movie much after seeing all the other BWP spoofs like the hip hop witch and all the other ones but i actually kind of enjoyed it.and the whole things not just porn like everyone thinks.there's a lot of comedy in this one although some of the comedy is a bit overdone like the man named ""Dick Bigdickian""and them all waking up and finding bras and (...)in the trees.just kinda stupid.Rated R for STRONG sexual content and nudity.lots and lots of nudity"
2,cute girls- bad movie,"If you are looking for a few girls to flash their tops for a few seconds and then the camera focusing on this really fat ugly comedic character, this may be the movie for you. The camera is hardly ever on the girls more than a few seconds and the strip scene is ruined by it beinf shot in the dark and through a huge roaring fire. Do not waste your time with this movie. There are much better ones of this genre out there."
4,Good flick but can get annoying,"I have to say that the Blair Witch Project is one of my all time favorite movies and when I saw that this was out I thought to myself ""why not get it and check it out"" and I can say that I am glad that I did. If you like the kind of movie that has nothing but T&A all the way through it then get this movie, don't get it thinking it is a masterpiece cause it is not and the only part that I hated was the one girl in it that all she does is talk and whine about going skinny dipping, not that there is anything wrong with that but it does get a little annoying. So if you are looking for a fun movie with good looking women and lots of T&A then pick this one up, you won't regret it."
4,Scantilly Clad Babes in the Woods,"This is a straight-forward but silly and lame parody of the Blair Witch Project. It gets the camcorder look of the original right, but is terribly written and acted, and full of unfunny jokes. This is as ""B"" as a B movie can get.So, why do I give it 4 stars? It gets one each for the four fabulous babes that spend most of the film hiking in the great outdoors while nearly or completely naked. I especially enjoyed the tough-yet-voluptuous-and-beautiful Julie K Smith. If I weren't already happily married, I'd love to go hiking with her.Enjoy!"
2,Many features but too many problems!,It was disappointing. I read reviews before I buy and I liked all the features at that great price. It looks great too but couldn't use it at all. Music stops or pauses randomly with IPOD & Iphone in docking. Thought the problem was with the docking interface so I tried connecting the IPOD via 'aux in' and still same problem. The control buttons on the front also malfunction. I pressed 'DBBS' button but the power goes off.. Not sure if these problems are with just my unit. Returning it to amazon and getting my money back.
2,Static noise at low volumes,"Perhaps this boombox is alright if you are only playing at ""boom"" volume levels, but for quieter moments you can hear annoying static interference through the speakers. Poorly designed circuitry I'd say -- perhaps poor wiring insulation or some form of feedback. Tried both my iTouch and my kid's Nano with similar disappointing results."
5,Ipod boom box,"Excelent product. Easy to carry around. I like it because it has Am/Fm and CD player, plus remote control. Cool!!!!"
4,iLive IBCD2817,Very reasonable price and fully functional. The iPod dock is definitely a plus. The only wish is the CD open and selection slide switches could be better designed for easier operation.
4,I'm not totally satisfied,It looks good but all the time the power cards come out and falls down.And also some time remote doesn't work. With that price its ok.
5,iLive is GREAT!,I am very happy with my iLive. It is light weight and easy to transport. The sound quality is good as well. I used this for my wedding and it worked great.
1,Junk,"I'm sure I got a defective product, but whether using the cd or ipod, it would play for 5 minutes, then stop for 5 minutes then start again. I checked everything. It was the player.Amazon picked up the package and refunded my card within a few days. I love the emails that let me know what's going on."
3,Its okay....nothing special,"I ordered this to use for my office with the iPod nano 4g. It works great if the music is up pretty high. if its too low, which I have to have it to use it in my office, I can hear static. I haven't decided yet if I am going to exchange it for something different. The radio part works awesome. I am high up in a building, no window in my office, and I get great FM reception. I haven't tried the CD Player yet. The remote works great too! It rund my iPod without a problem. its a little bigger than I thought it was going to be, but otherwise it works good enough."
1,DONT BUY IF YOU WANT TO USE YOU'RE IPOD!,"the radio is great, but when i put my ipod in it plays a song for 30 seconds and then pauses it. i dont know why it does this, but it is frustrating that this was the main reason to buy it and i cannot listen to my ipod! BUYER BEWARE!"
1,Ipod docking boombox,"The 1st day I was pleased with this productThe second day the unit started pausing the IPOD all by itself in the middle of playing a song without my touching it.The 3rd day it would not allow me to change the radio stations.I will try to return this item to the seller for I fear if I use it again it may even self destruct the next time I try to use it.Perhaps I just got a bad unit out of all they sell, but I wouldn't bet on it."
2,Shuts off by itself.,"Either my house is haunted or this radio stinks. This boombox shuts off every time I use it. That's right. It shuts off by itself. Actually it pauses itself and the only way to ""unpause"" it is with the remote control. So if I ever lose it, the radio will be even more useless. ;(Don't waste your money on this contraption. It's way too expensive to be acting like this! And I JUST bought it too! This happened the VERY FIRST TIME I used it. The sound quality isn't that great either--tinny, lackluster, flat sounds."
2,Functional but CD player doesn't work well,"I bought this specifically because it had the CD player as well as the ipod dock and it was portable. It works great with the ipod (I use a touch). However, the cd player fails to read almost every CD I put into it. This includes store bought cd's. If you need a CD player on your unit, look elsewhere. This was definitely not worth the price and doesn't work well."
4,good for the price,"It's a good unit for the price,works with our Ipod.Sound quality is decent for a small unit."
2,ilive,"Because this product had an intermittent buzzing drone coming from the speakers, we returned it. Amazon was nice about returning it. I wish the annoying sound hadn't been there because it was a wonderful product otherwise."
1,"As long as you don't it to work, great product.","We are on our second one (we returned the first one), and more problems with this one than the first. I wanted this for its portability and ability to use the iPod dock. I found within ten (10) minutes, that the first point was good, the second was completely amiss. The iPod would play for about 3-4 minutes and then pause itself. I tried using the different adapters thinking that would make a difference, but no luck. This occurred with both of the units we've had. Second, if you want to use the digital radio tuner (AM or FM)... it will let you get close to the exact station, but it is a challenge (a game almost) to get exactly on the number. Additionally, the sound quality on radio has much to be desired... of course that could be because the actual station is not tuned in because the digital tuner moves up / down the dial on its own.Overall, big disappointment... would not recommend this to ANYONE."
1,Very Bad Choise,"Was my brother`s present and bad choise...Bad sound , poor options , unless low price i too much when you have the product , you feels have been cheated! DO NOT BUY!!Seems baby dolls items.."
4,Practical and fun,Matches my expectation. It would have been nice if the CD player took MP3 CDs but that's asking for too much from some vendors for that price.
5,ILive Boobox,"Bought this Boom Box when I purchased my IPod Classic. My wife and I really enjoy this product. The sound is great and it is very easy to control your IPod with the boom box remote control. It has inserts so that you can use several different types of Ipods with it and they all fit snug. I recommend this to anyone that is looking for a portable sound system that will run on AC as well as battery power. It also has a CD player in the back, so you can use it for just about everything.Brent"
3,"bought 2 of these, 1 good, 1 bad","About a year or two ago, I bought one of these players in white for my girlfriend. She likes it a lot and I think it works great. Sounds good, looks nice, very functional IPOD dock with CD player. Very convenient.A few weeks ago I bought a second one for myself to use at work on my desk. I used it about 2 weeks but it was funky. It was cosmetically the same as my girlfriend's player except it was black and there was a noticable buzzing/crackling when playing my IPOD. It was most obvious at low volumes but I noticed it when I had it up at medium volume as well. I don't know what the deal is but this needs fixed. I briefly tried the radio which, besides mediocre reception, seemed OK. I did not try the CD player.If you buy one of these, good luck. I hope you get one of the good ones."
2,Defective,"Like others, the one I received had noticeable static coming from the speakers at low volumes.And, like one other reviewer, the unit is defective. It turns itself off after ~2 minutes when in iPod/Aux input mode whether using the iPod dock or the mini-jack input.The feature set is good (iPod, CD, radio, aux input, remote), but not executed well by iLive. It's going back."
1,Junk,"Junk would not recommend this product to anyone, Luck would have it I was able to get a complete refund less the shipping."
3,works well but life span doesn't last long,"I bought this stereo two years ago from Amazon and it was great for everyday Ipod use. The CD player somehow broke after the second time using it and started to skip tracks while playing. The speakers were very clear although a little fuzzy at higher volumes. It wasn't too much of a distraction though. The remote is pretty useless because you have to be standing pretty close for it to work and the front has to be facing you...you might as well just go over to the stereo and press the buttons. As for the shelf life, it just died on me last month. Somehow the speaker blew out when I was playing my Ipod. The volume wasn't up really loud or anything, I guess it was just its time to go. Overall, it was a great stereo and I'll probably buy me a new one that doesn't cost this much. If I were you, I would find something similar at a cheaper price."
5,THESE SELL FOR $25,"I can't believe how expensive these are on here! I bought one at Aldi, same band and color, for $25! I've even seen these at Wal-Mart, Fleet Farm, Shopko... all major stores for roughly $20. Go to the store and save yourself $50! It is a great radio but I wouldn't pay this much for one."
1,I should have read the bad reviews first!,"I bought this player to listen to the radio/ipod/cd player for the kitchen.The sound quality for the fm radio has lot of static. You can't really listen to the radio! The cd player DOES NOT have anti-skip technology; therefore, it jumps every 10 seconds of music (specially if the volume is all the way up - I guess the sound vibrations makes it skip). To makes matter worse the IPOD connectivity doesn't work either: The music plays for a few seconds and then goes silent for minutes and then comes back again over and over... Unfortunately, I threw out the box where the radio came in so I can't return the product to Amazon.Avoid this product like the plague unless you want to waste your money like I did.Edgar Almanzar"
2,Poor quality,"If you need a CD player, this is not the one. The first one I got was used, and lost power after one minute ?! Amazon sent me a new replacement. This one worked fine with the iPod, but the CD did not work. Save your time. Dont try this product."
1,iLive Boombox,"I read some poor reviews on this item but ignored them. Some people always complaint. BUT let me tell you - they were right. This item stinks. It is the worst product I have ever purchased. The first one I got was staticky, the digital display didn't work, it would turn on and off by itself - just awful. It was replaced with a new one. That one was worse. It was staticky and I never got the chance to try out the ipod part of it since it just stopped working altogether within a few days. Absolutely awful. Returning it has also been a nightmare. Return labels don't show up. Double charges to my charge card.Anyone looking to purchase this item MUST rethink - buy something else. One problem - okay but this was ridiculous."
2,bad taste. forms too much of foam!,"""I read good reviews on WPI and so ordered it. However, I am NOT liking either of the taste, grape or watermelon. Also, the major problem is when I mix it with water in blender, it immediately forms too much of foam. So, It's like drinking foam, and not the mix. It results in extra air and gas in stomach. Not good! To overcome this, I tried mixing in the glass but it does not dissolve then :-("""
4,Kitchen must have!,"This thing rocks, clean edges, sturdy design, compact size. No brainer if you ask me. I have one and got one for my mom for Christmas."
2,"Works well for a while, doesn't last","I bought one of these at the grocery store, to replace a different brand that we've been happy with for a few years but finally wore out. The single handle was a little tricky to get used to, but once past that hurdle it worked great, for about a month. The behavior is the same as that described by the lady who has been using hers for five years, just VERY premature. I'm here on Amazon looking for a more reliable design that won't need to be replaced monthly."
2,Spyro can opener lasted two months,"We picked the Spyro can opener to replace another brand. At first, the unusual opening method and lack of a positive puncture were unnerving, but I quickly got past that. While it works, it is a positive joy. What it does not do well are large cans (institutional size), cans with dents on the seam, and cans with rebated edges (crimp for lid is back a little bit from side of can). Put the roller over the edge, start turning the handle, and when the resistance drops off, the lid is cut.About two months into using the Spyro, it started to skip on the can seam while turning the handle. The lid would only be freed intermittently around the periphery. Regretfully, I'm giving up on the Spyro.I have bought an American made can opener off Amazon and look forward to a positive grip on the can, ability to tolerate dented can seams, large cans, and rebated rims."
3,Loved it for about 2 months,"I think this is the safest, most ingenious can opener design I have ever seen.It actually pries the top of the can off of its seal, rather than cutting the metal, so there are no sharp edges to deal with. I just wish it had held up for more than 2 months. I have dexterity issues that make conventional manual openers difficult to use. After my One Touch finally gave up, we got the Good Cook Classic Safe Cut and absolutely loved it. Very easy to use once you get the hang of it. However, after about 2 months, it stopped prying the lid off the can on the first pass, and now if we can get it to pry up half of it so that we can bend it up and get the contents out, we are doing good. I think it has something to do with a spring or something inside loosening up so that the two metal parts no longer fit together tightly the way they should while opening a can. I will probably try another one, but if it doesn't last, it will be the last."
1,worn out after 2 months,"I bought this at my local big box store. It looked neat and appeared easy and simple to use. Worked great initially, but after about 2 months of usage, it will no longer open a can. It pinches the metal edge of the can, and yes the resistance does drop off after one complete revolution...but, still can't get the top off the can. I've had to work over the can with a pair of pliers to get the lids off. Usually I tear the top to create a small opening to pour out the contents. I highly recommend spending your money on a different opener. I did purchase a traditional opener that makes the nasty sharp edges."
1,Don't waste your money on this one.,I have this can opener and it worked great for less than a month. Now when I use it I have to go around 3 times and it still doesn't always cut all they way around so I have to bend the lip up. Just yesterday I noticed that the opener is making tiny little metal shards that are falling into my can of food. I was just looking for a new one to replace this piece of crap and felt I should warn you to put your money towards a better brand. I'm going with consumer reports this time.
2,Another that didn't last,"The one I purchased at a local grocery store worked fairly well at first, but I had a couple of issues right off. One is it often left small metal shavings & splinters on the can which could easily get into the food. The other issue is that the handle was pretty stiff to turn. I can't imagine someone with arthritic hands trying to use it.HOWEVER, I've been using it for two or three months and have started having the same problem others described. (I'm opening three or four cans a day at most to feed the critters.) It no longer opens cleanly on the first pass, sometimes not even by the third time around and I'm frequently having to pry the top up and back to get at the cans' contents.Now I'm scouring the options on Amazon for a better can opener."
1,great but doesn't last,"I purchased this can opener in May, 2011. It broke in November, 2011. Did a great job while it lasted but not quality made. I'll be looking for another brand."
5,Very nice edges,"At first, it's odd to get used to, without having a pair of handles to squeeze, but the cut edges are not sharp at all, which is great!"
2,Great can opener but a flawed design,"This is one of the best can openers around but this is my 3rd one and they all broke the same way - the twist handle splits and the can opener ceases to work. I would recommend to go with a cheaper unit that does not break so much. Works really well till it breaks, so if you buy it just plan on replacing it every 1-2 years.Note to the manufacturer, this is not exactly the cheapest opener out there so I really feel that for the money this is inexcusable. I am sure they could do it better and even if it cost a little more, it would be worth it. The design is great and if you could just provide a handle that is as durable as the rest of the unit, you would have a vastly superior product that will last well enough to become a kitchen standard!"
5,Performs as Claimed,"This has become my ""go to"" can opener. It indeed opens the can without cutting, so that a non-hazardous edge remains. It is easier to operate than a conventional opener. I had hoped it would open Coke cans (which have an indented top); however, my disappointment is tempered by the fact that no other opener that I know of will do that. If you need a can opener, this is it. If you nick yourself a lot on opened cans or lids, this is your answer."
1,No Thumbs,"I don't know if its me but i had the hardest time with this thing. I had trouble getting it to grip and catch the can, and getting the lid off. I finally gave up when I sliced my thumb pretty bad. I just don't think a can opener should take that much effort. I had a safety opener before that wore out after years and was very disappointed with this replacement."
2,Wears out,"Like some of the other reviewers, my can opener like this wore out after just a few years. Very disappointing. Those of you who left a positive review -- enjoy it while it lasts!!"
5,Good book,Product came in great condition. Invaluable resource for the study of poromechanics or biphasic constitutive theories.
1,This treatment of poroelasticity is dated.,"This book, written by a member of the didactic Biot Club, goes far beyond where Biot ever though anyone would take his linear approximations. The information and approach is dated, and has no application, although the math is fun. As someone who is in the know has stipulated, ""This book does not pass the smell test."" A better approach is one that addresses real micromechanical processes, and actual phenomenological behavior of natural porous substances, made in a certified lab."
3,Somebody Gave me the cd-JointMobb-Zaggin Die'n Everyday.,"Some good songs. not too talented, but some good rhymes here and there. I guess part of that time really. Not one of the best underground, but different."
3,Highly recommended ... to be reproduced,"The film has a nice idea, I knew it as soon as I saw its poster. S.W.A.T vs. HRT, what a brilliant action sequence would be seen in the film! But it failed. The producer had to write it out that real SWAT members and tactics were showed in this movie, or I would not know that!There was 1 out of the 3 stars for the idea."
4,"Great Cleve, OH MOVIE!","Great movie for Clevelanders as they used sets and actual S.W.A.T . Members from Cleveland, OH Good realistic cop movie"
4,"Scary real, and also laughable fake...it's like watching two movies","A friend who's on a SWAT team called me up saying ""You have to see this movie! It's the real deal! At least the first half...""The first half of the movie, tactics and gun-handling are top-notch, realistic, and the way that tactical teams are actually trained. But about halfway through the movie, the entire thing changes. Suddenly SWAT guys are shooting from the hip, marching out into open areas in the middle of a fire fight, it makes no sense at all.Apparently, there was a switch of directors, producers, or something part way through production and it shows.I think it's out of print, but if you find a copy, buy it! Just for the first half, the tactics are that real."
5,Very easy to read and understand,"This book is written as if Mr. Heavin were talking to you, so it's easy to understand. I read it all in one sitting, but read it again to review the key points. I was only trying to lose the weight from having my daughter, but the diet and the Curves for Women workouts got me into better shape than I was BEFORE I had my baby! If you can, look up a Curves to do the workouts with the diet because the all-over strength training is what did it for me!"
4,4 stars,It is a beautiful ear cuff that I'm very glad to have found. The only minor and ignorable problem I have with it is that it causes a slight amount of soreness on the inside of the ear. Thanks for the wonderful product.
5,denial of the will-to-live = starvation,"I prefer to eat -I am actually a bit overweight. Nevertheless, Schopenhauer's work is helpful for understanding Kant and is beautifully written, which is why I give it five stars, even if it will make you want to die. Who knows, we may be better off without you.In addition to Plato and Kant, Jacob Boehme is good to read along with Schopenhauer to see just what kind of decadence you are dealing with.You must experience the depth before you experience the height - so read Schopenhauer."
1,If you liked the first essay....,"Nothing better than reading a long drawn out reason supporting your blathering's when you were younger. You whined in your essay, and you continued to do so trying to get people to buy into why your whining should be credible. Almost makes me wish I didn't take Philosophy in college. Yuck."
2,It's Alright,"I've bought many of these cartridges and I what I can say about them is that they are ok. They don't last very long and sometimes it doesn't print even though the screen shows that the cartridge is full. For my printer, this is the only black ink that I could buy so, I'll have to get used to it. If the prices were cheaper, my review of the product may have been better. Enjoy."
1,Nothing but frustration,The first black ink cartridge I got was a dud. The replacement was also a dud. Will not buy from this company again.
1,Still waiting for my order to arrive,"I realize that companies run out of an item and have to restock, but today is Feb 25th, I ordered this item on Jan. 31st, and I still have not received my Lexmark Black cartridge. I really can't rate the product because I have not received it. I hope the company will notify me and let me know when it is going to be shipped. I received my color cartridge within a few days, ordered on the same date as this order."
2,You have to use them but you do not have to love them!!,Don't you hate getting suckered? If you are reading this then you probably know by know that they make their money from the cartridges and not from the printers. I just hope that next time I purchase a printer I remember to get a more cost effective printer. These cartridges cost too much for what they are and often out of a sealed package they are dried up (poor self life).
2,this is too expensive,"with only 600 sheets printed and [a decent amount of money] per cartridge, that's .05 cents per sheet. Too expensive. Funny, because my Lexmark printer only cost [a little bit more] and came with both a b/w and color cartridge."
1,black ink,These are the worst cardridges ever....if you don't use them each day the heads dry up and can not use. waste of ones money.they are all the same.
4,"Pricey, but excellent quality","A bit high-priced, but much better than my old bubblejet. Also, it does last a long time."
1,Drafter Joe,These Lexmark ink cartridges are a joke!!! I'm tired of spending time and money on a Lexmark printer and its ink cartridges that don't perform they way they should. I have better things to do!!! I threw my Lexmark printer away!!! Best thing I ever did!!! Spend your money on a different printer. You'll be glad you did.
3,2cd attempt at a review for ok product,"This is my 2cd attempt to get a posted review for this product. I used to use this product & the 12A1980 color for Compaq model IJ300 now I use a Compaq IJ750. My complaint is about the product is why it runs so much. The other day I printed 3 pages in a row-2 of the 3 the black ink ran!! And, this was on good paper."
3,Decent- but could be better,"I use this & the color 12A1980 for former a Compaq IJ300 now a Compaq IJ750. My complaint on this ink-it runs too much for no reason. I just printed 3 pages-2 of the 3 pages the ink ran in spots. I do not appreciate this, especially when I am printing on really good paper."
1,"If I could rate it any lower, I would","If you don't make a whole bunch of prints every day, the ink dries on the cartridge heads, making them unusable. If you cannot soak the ink free, the cartridge is now full and dead. Total waste of money buying new ones, because the same thing will happen with them."
1,Nice quality... when it works,"I am so glad I decided to check Amazon before going out to buy another new cartridge! It's sad to see so many others have experienced the same frustration with replacing these expensive cartridges so often. I had been disappointed in my Z42's print quality from day one, but assumed the ink levels couldn't be the cause since they were nearly full. I kept cleaning the nozzles, realigning, and contacting support... I finally gave up and replaced the cartridges, and only then did I see the quality I had been expecting. I realize now the cartridges that came with the printer were dried up when I bought it. I don't need to print often, but who would expect that printing less would cost more?! I doubt I get 50 pages per cartridge, and more than half of those are the ruined pages and test page after test page... THANK YOU SO MUCH for the suggestion of soaking in cold water - that did the trick!"
1,defective out of box,"Purchased from Amazon Lexmark 70 black ink cartridge.... Defective out of box... pulled tape off, placed it in printer and nothing happened. No ink in cartrdge? Definately no ink on paper. Rarely write reviews, but had to write this short note."
1,Item Did not Work!,"The cartridge did not work. The printer did not recognize it. It kept displaying ""Change Cartridge"". That occured whenever I used generic cartridges, and did not whenever I used a genuine Lexmark cartridge (12A1970) from Office Max. Any suggestion to make the this cartride work?"
5,Lexxi,"The items were in the original packaging, sealed and in NEW condition.Although there was not an expiration date on the package, the Ink cartridges have worked fine."
4,"High quality, high cost","I have had my Lexmark X125 printer / copier /fax for several years. I was disgruntled about the cost of ink, so purchased another popular brand printer - and couldn't return it fast enough. The quality was terrible compared to the Lexmark X125. I use mine a lot, but not for printing pictures. I do print in color, and use the color / black cartridges fairly equally.My complaint is the cost of the ink cartridges. I did try a 'remanufactured' cartridge from Walmart and quickly returned to buy the Lexmark brand; the ink didn't last anytime at all in the off-brand.The Lexmark does require proper installation of the cartridges, and I think that's where some are erring. You have to open the utility on your computer, tell it you've installed a hi-yield cartridge, and align to get the proper installation and message. Otherwise, it will continue to tell you you need to replace your cartridge, or that it is 'low.'Overall, I am happy with the quality, but unhappy with the price of ink."
2,"Waterproof, but definitely not smear-proof","Lexmark's waterproof black ink seems to degrade very quickly. After having a cartridge for a few months, the ink starts to smear badly when touched (even after drying for days or weeks). After 3 cartridges, I'm convinced that this is a consistent problem with Lexmark's ink. Unfortunately, with no alternative available, those of us with Lexmark's printers (that use this ink) are stuck with smearing ink, and no help from Lexmark (repeated emails have yielded no interest in resolving the problem. They say ""some minor smearing is normal,"" and don't address the major smearing).The NON-waterproof COLOR ink does not have this smearing problem. (12A1980)Other than the smearing ink, I love my Lexmark 5700. If I could get good black ink for it, it would be perfect."
1,Useless & ripoff !!!,"This is one of the classic examples of selling a Printer for $100 to 150 & ripoff on catridges. I have used at least 5-6 of these & they don;t last long. I am pretty sure i get far less than 600 pages that they claim.FYI, my HP laser has a $70 cartridge has been lasting for over 5 years & still running great which i have made my default printer.Throw your printer & forget about this. Get a HP laser & no chaging cartridge for a while !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,My opinon....Crapola,"Lexmark is the worst product (right next to Compaq Computers) I have ever had the displeasure of using. I tried the cold water method, work a little while after ..great tip. The black cartride does dry out too fast!! So I am now looking into a good laser printer. Not sure what I will do about the color setup? I would get the refill kits, but why bother if the cartride is going to dry out all the time. It seems the red dries out quickest? Oh well..lesson well learned."
4,Funny but dated,"This book has many funny stories from a wide variety of sources, mostly English due to the author. If you are familiar with the British classical educational system, this will be appreciated. The references are all pre-1970, which is fine for those of us who like to read funny Roman quotes, but some more modern, 21st century ones would be nice too. Of course, the more modern people often think we are the first to do everything and don't know that what we think is original was actually said in ancient Greece."
4,ballet slippers,"I've purchased these slippers for years, so I knew what I would be getting. They are the best for flexibility and for showing point."
3,Lovely but off size,"My daughter has a Bloch jazz shoe in a size 5 but when I ordered her the next size 5.5 in ballet slipper, they were way too big. Will need to reorder probably a 4."
2,There must be a better bang for your buck.,"I bought this software on the recommendation of some software review site, and I must say my 9 year old daughter and I were disappointed. The graphics are sometimes hard to make out on the screen. (The animation altogether isn't very appealing at all, but that's not why I bought it . . . )And my daughter kept repeating, ""But I want to learn sentences!"" It's just an okay introduction if you want to learn the names of fruits and vegetables."
1,Very Annoying program,I was very disappointed in this software. The voices of the animated characters are squeeky and they're annoying to watch. The image on our screen is too small. Some of the activities are too difficult for an adult (the pick a door to find the correct animal is pointless). My kids were bored quickly as was I and we learned very little. Now hunting for better software.
3,I have Windows ME,"I haven't really been able to run this software, I think it's because I have ME. I have used it before on my sister-in-law's computer and thought it was a great way to grab a young child's interest in another language."
2,Little to offer,"I wonder why this was written, and even more so, why it was published. Beginners will be lost by page three, since the author assumes his readers already know the fundamentals. Accomplished photographers will be bored by page three, since the author discloses nothing new, and illustrates his disclosures with photographs that are, well, nothing special. On virtually every page there is another cryptic reference to the Zone System, but anyone up to speed on tone placements via Zone placements will be light years ahead of this book. Those who aren't will feel they're reading Esperanto."
4,Barbara Lynn still in fine voice,"These are new recordings by one of Soul's most under-rated and understated voices. She re-visits some of her own hits, as well as doing heart-breaking versions of tracks like Brenton Wood's ""I Like the Way You Love Me"" and the Marvelettes' ""Forever"", but the standout cut must be her take on ""Somebody Please."" Her voice has a depth and maturity now that cuts straight to the heart. A welcome addition to any collection. Karl Tsigdinos, presenter, The River of Soul, Today FM, Dublin, Ireland"
1,Not what it says it is.,Such an awful purchase and way over prices! With shipping $16! Only one stupid Ring that is not sized correctly! Such a waste of my time and money!
5,A must addition to anyone's collection,I only wish I had the correct words to reflect my thoughts and true enjoyment of this album. A must listen!
3,Check what type of screws your TV needs before buying,"I have a 32"" LED Samsung I used this mount for. My Samsung uses M8 screws to mount it to a wall. This mount not only did not come with the M8 screws to mount my TV, but when I bought the proper screws, I had to file the brackets so the screws would fit through the brackets. I advise checking your manual to find out what screws your TV needs. The biggest screws this mount comes with are M6s. If your TV needs anything bigger, I'd avoid this mount.On a positive note, the mount is extremely easy to mount to a wall. It is very solid and easy to adjust the tilt."
4,Peerless ST640P TV wall mount,"Seems well built and strong, have yet to mount it but it should be very straight forward. I called my electrician over to go over where and how I wanted my power run to where it will hang and he commented that he liked the large amount of opening in which he had to put in the electrical and auxiliary item boxes."
1,Not in this universe,"This product did not fit my Panasonic Professional 42"" plasma (th-42ph9uk). Returned to Amazon without incident."
4,Revenge is what was got,"This book was revenge at its best. The ending made my stomach hurt, but the book is very good. You have to really pay attention, or you may get lost, because Goines has many characters doing all sorts of things during the story. There was a lot of hostility between the Blacks and Hispanics from the outset, and it escalated as the story moved forward. All in all, another piece by Goines which is off the hook."
1,No Pundit Left Behind,"Apparently the government funds that could have been wasted on unnecessary projects like arming Humvees or properly funding No Child Left Behind were instead better spent paying for favorable coverage of administration policies by conscientious pundits like Mr. McManus, who, by the way, failed to disclose this to either his readers or his publishers.Who else is pushing opinions in the media that are paid for with your tax dollars? The list continues to grow..."
2,Definately a strange book.,"Book nine in the ever downward spirling Black Stallion series, ""The Black Stallion Revolts"" hardly does anything to save it. When their plane crashes, Alec and his horse are seperated. An amnesic Alec wanders around until he miracuously re-unites with the Black. This book is definately strange and leaves you puzzled and unsatisfied."
5,Shame it's out of print,"The Ogre Downstairs is very funny, highly memorable, realistic about family and school tensions, and is the only book I ever read to my younger sister which made her laugh out loud and demand that I read more (normally she listened only under duress). I liked the animated dustballs best. I think it may be back in print in the UK - worth a look at Amazon.co.uk."
4,Not just for kids!,"The Ogre Downstairs is by far the funniest book that Diana Wynne Jones has ever written, although it's not my favourite. I especially liked the bars of toffee and the dolls house, but it's not your usual DWJ book. Although it centres around a chemistry set, it's probably her most un-science fiction book yet! Still, it's the book to read if you're in need of cheering up. And it's not just for children!"
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Three kids are not particularly happy with the new man that their mother has decided to marry, as to them, he is not very pleasant. Hence the title, which applies to this bloke.However, all is not as it seems, and the kids get some new ties, which turn out to be basically magical chemistry sets.Hijinks ensure."
5,China:A Century of Revolution,"China: A Century of Revolution ranks among the best historical documentaries I've ever seen. It presents a balanced perspective on the history of China during the 20th century. I especially recommend it to teachers for use in the classroom. Selective use of it can significantly improve student learning and interest in the subject. The film is enhanced by the interviews with Chinese from different generations, geographical locations and economic circumstances. Documentary footage from the early 20th century is a plus as is the depiction of China during World War II and the revolution of the 1940s. It carefully examines the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution and emphaizes the terrible toll these movements took on the Chinese people. Finally it provides valuable insights on the transition from Mao and the contributions of Deng. A must for all educators and people with an interest in China."
4,Modern China origins,"A fairly good account of China in the 20th Century, with archival footage, although it does (perhaps necessarily) over simplify some of the events and portray the triumph of Mao Zedong as inevitable and tends to gloss over the Cultural Revolution"
5,Powerful film and video footage,Most of the history was well known to me but the film and video footage brought a depth of understanding that previously eluded me.
3,"Disc 1 - too much on ""Long March""","So far I have only viewed Disc 1, it appears overwhelming on the ""Long March"" and too little on other events. The founding of the Republic and overthrown of the Qing dynasty are important events which needs more coverage. It appears there is a lack of balance on what are the important events. What about the ""May 4"" movement?"
5,Great Overview,"This is a great overview to modern China for anyone interested in doing business or traveling there. So much of modern China's history happened out of view of the rest of the world. Now, Sue Williams and company have pulled back the curtain to give a great, objective view of China's recent past. Much of the narrative is told by local Chinese who lived the history. The historical footage is great, as well.This is a concise, objective, and, dare I say, entertaining look at what might be the most important nation in the 21st century."
5,Fantastic piece of work,"If you really want a moving and riveting oral and pictorial history of modern China, this is the video set to get. Fantastic narration and amazing archival footage, this video set is used in many University and High School curricula. A tremendous documentary work that I hope is shown again on TV.P.S. If you want to round out your education of the pre-revolutionary beginnings then you should get ""The Soong Dynasty"" by Seagrave. It is an absolutely fascinating account of the Soong family's rise to power and the beginnings of the revolution in China."
5,Hats Off to the Chief Customer Officer!,"Jeanne Bliss's new book, ""Chief Customer Officer: Getting Past Lip Service to Passionate Action,"" offered a world of resources to our company. As the CEO of a rapidly growing organization, it was important to find a business model for customer service and retention that would not only match the culture we have developed, but also provide a backdrop for strategic planning. Every chapter not only discussed the importance of operating wholeheartedly for the customer, but ways to assess our current position and improve upon it.Thanks Jeanne for helping us get past the lip service!"
5,Perfect Book if You Love Irish History or Politics,"Here is the perfect book for anyone who likes cultural history, politics, or Ireland. I couldn't put it down; it is lots of fun to read-scholarly but very accessible, written with humor and grace. If you want a lively, detailed account of the intellectual and cultural brawls taking place in Ireland at the turn of the 20th century, this is THE book.A.N. Oakes"
4,Information in the book is good!,The information in the book is good. The binding came apart from the pages so I had to place it in a 3-ring binder.
3,"Too much ""renter"" not enough ""expenses"" space...could be improved","I bought this book along with ""How to rent Vacation properties by Owner"".....THAT book is great, but for me, I was hoping for a better organizer. My main disappointment is simply not enough pages for expenses, but like over 50 pages, (thats over 200 renters) for your renters. Perhaps that is OK for those who rent nightly or weekly, but for me, who rent my vacation home for one month minimum, and usually for 3 month at a time, this was off balance.I have many expenses that I need to keep track of, utilities, mowing, cleaning,etc,etc......for me, I need WAY more then the 6 pages they give for expenses.....I would think any owner would. Pockets and tabs would have been nice, but the main thing is it needs WAY more pages for expenses.....6 pages is not enough."
3,Vacation rental Organizer,"I do think that she could have explained how to organize it in a clearermanner.Also, the the examples in the explanation page are not in large enough print.I do use it but I need another book to put my leases and calendars.It could use ""at a glance"" monthly and yearly calendar"
1,good try but no cigar,"needs to be straight forward. list of questions should be easy to read by ea. guest. confusing entering dates. should have a prospect sheet in front of it as well so you can record all of your entries. it also needs to have jackets for exta papers and rental agreements you print out, perhaps by month. A mon. to mon. calander would be an essential thing to have as well."
3,The Vacation Rental Organizer,"It' a very useful organizer. The quality of the paper and print, is not as good as the original but it will fit my needs. It's not perfect but there is nothing else out there as portable unless I set up my own system."
4,Pretty handy to start with,"I use this for my vacation rental, which typically rents for 2-3 days at a time. I have found it to be quite handy for keeping track of rents, deposits, contracts, etc. , though I have ended up modifying it quite a bit. It was particularly helpful when I first started renting -- knowing what I should be tracking, etc."
3,Don't buy used,"A handy tool to keep everything in one place. If you are following the advice from the authors other books you will like this. Just don't buy it used. My copy came partially written in. Not a huge hurdle to overcome, just annoying. Would have bought it new if I know some of it was filled in for another home."
1,I will not recomand this transaction,I will not recomand this transaction. One you see before you buy and after it ...................
2,Poor Production - The Guys Sound Better Than This !,"I haven't seen this in years, but remember the sound doesn't do them any justice. The video seemed ok, so I'd prolly give it a 3 for the video & a 1 for the audio...It's a pity really. Hopefully, if they re-release it on DVD, they can get the original multi-track reels & remix it, so it sounds more like the guys really did. The sound is very compressed, no dynamics, the guitars are thin & Michael's vocal sound isn't as strong as it could be...Prop's go out to the guys though for making the effort, as back in the day, it was a big deal & they do rock !To hear the band as they should sound, listen to Against The Law..."
1,WTF!,"Being a real Drill Sergeant, I bought this as a spare, but when I took it out the box...WTF? It's a TOY! If this was for a halloween costume or some bit, it would be perfect. So let that be a lesson, Kids....don't expect professional gear at what-ta bargain prices!"
1,Important fact omitted from description,"This product I'd listed as:FeltImportedWOOL FELTHIGHEST QUALITYAlso said:Product DescriptionOur American made military campaign hat. Made of all natural wool fibers, including a black chinstrap.What isn't stated is that the black chin strap is a very cheap plastic that distracts from the overall appearance of this hat. It makes it look as a costume piece and not a high quality hat."
1,DO NOT BUY IF YOU ARE A DRILL INSTRUCTOR,"Junk!!!! Not quality for the military!! Flimsy bill, not the right color.. not even the right material! Not to mention we ordered a size 6 and got size 7 in the mail!! i do not reccomend this product! We returned it last week, and still have not got our money back for the thing!! waste of money!! Its more of a toy than anything although im not sure who would pay 70$ for a TOY!!!"
1,Not too happy,Item arrived damaged. The company never reimbursed me for the postage I paid let alone the postage I paid to send it back. Would never deal with these people again.
5,The Professor's review of M.O.N.,"Review: It's very obvious that someone had a lot of fun making this film.It is fun-filled with clichés that actually work if you set back and enjoy them. (teenagers separating when they should stick together, etc). It is obvious that this is low-budget production however, I think, well put together.It does start-off somewhat slow, and it isn't a horribly fast-paced film, but I think this adds to the viewing enjoyment. I likedM.O.N.how it incorporates psychological-horror which really makes it more creepy.Overall, I really enjoyed this film."
1,PATHETIC,"THIS ""MOVIE"" IS ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE!!!!! I'M THINKING THAT THE PREVIOUS REVIEWERS WERE PAID BY THE DIRECTOR. EACH SCENE WAS LAUGHABLE AND VERY NON-BELIEVABLE. I WISH I COULD GET MY MONEY AND TIME SPENT WATCHING THIS PIECE OF CRAP BACK!!!! IF YOU VALUE YOUR TIME AND MONEY, WATCH ANYTHING ELSE!!!!"
4,Just what you'd expect,"Well, the package is of what amounts to two large ""rubber bands."" They are new and clean and really taut, compared to the old one that I had to replace. The simple instructions on the packaging are clear enough that I was able to get the new band on right away. And since my last band was the factory original, I expect the new band to last another 2-3 years, and then I have an extra band in storage!"
4,Not bad for a replacement,I wasn't sure if this product was the right size. But it worked out well even though it's not design for my vacuum. It was delivered on time and I am satisfied with the way it's working.
2,It's a BELT,It's a belt. Horrendously overpriced with shipping added. There are MUCH better buys on eBay and almost everywhere else. Most sellers send a package of three for lower cost and cheaper shipping. Caveat emptor.
2,Unfit,"Poor fit , opening was not large enough to fit on the corespanding walker muffer that went with it. Not happy"
5,Divine wisdom from the greatest Sufi of the 20th century.,"This masterpiece of Sufism combines over 100 short sufi stories and explanations with several formal discourses along with question and answer sessions. The teachings are exalted and unadulterated, gleaned directly from the spoken word as Bawa could neither read nor write. The book is AT LEAST on par with those of Rumi and more comprehensive in their explanations and examples. A MUST-read for anyone seriously interested in Sufism."
1,An Embarrassment of Irrelevance,Robotic recitation of facts not brought to their natural conclusive effects is the worthless waste of paper this volume represents. Peter Robb should be made to reimburse everyone who had the misfortune of buying this snore.
2,Does half the job!,"Purchased this product to install on my 2006 dodge ram 2500 with overloads. 8ft boxThe parts were right, drivers side fit wonderfully, but the passenger side Does Not Fit. The factory exhaust brackets, which are welded thru the frame, interfere with the mounting of the 58186 bracket. Can you say frustrating!"
2,Boring...,A lot of people are tired of Norton Antivirus 2004 and NA2005 is same... better buy another thing.
2,Upgrade from 2003 to 2005 hung on WindowsXP,"I tried to upgrade Norton AntiVirus from version 2003 to 2005 on WindowsXP, but the installation hung. I had no other programs running. Then I tried to uninstall Norton AntiVirus 2003 from the Add/Remove Programs and nothing would happen. I tried reinstalling 2005 from the CD. No success. I had to manually remove the 2003 software locally and from the registry. What finally allowed me to install 2005 completely was after I removed the Norton AntiVirus key from the following location: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall.I'm hoping this new 2005 version will work for me as well as 2003."
1,Lousy Norton,"I installed this shortly after getting it, but it doesn't work at all. I click on it and try to open it and it just doesn't work. It was a waste of money."
1,Symantec really should put more features in an Update,Norton Antivirus 2005 only has added an incomplete firewall called IWP. Basically no other new features. Highly not recommanded for users with Windows XP.
2,Norton Anti Virus review,"I purchased the Norton Anti Virus about 3 weeks after updating my computer from Windows ME to Windows XP. I had trouble installing it but I had an old edition of Norton Antivirus already (2000 version). When I finally got it installed, I then had problems with a loud irritating noise coming from my speakers. I have spend countless hours on the phone with Microsoft and Dell trying to fix this problem. I still have not resolved the problem. I am not sure whether it is the Norton Anitvirus program or not, but I did not have this problem until installing the Norton Antivirus 2005 program."
3,Sometimes it can work,"I'm certainly not here to defend either Norton or McAfee. They have caused me numerous headaches over the years.But I did want to provide an alternate viewpoint to most of the reviews here: Norton AV works just fine in *some* situations. Online review forums like this will tend to overemphasize the opinions of people who have the most extreme reactions -- or with software, the worst technical results.I have a fairly typical set-up - Windows XP SP2 with a 2004 version of Norton AV installed. While very hesitant after reading the reviews in this forum, I did an upgrade installation to 2005 Norton AV and, low and behold, everything went smoothly and according to plan. No issues. None.Now I'm not here to minimize the pains that others have experienced. I believe the software is likely buggy. But it does work just fine in some situations (Yours? Who knows? =)"
1,Bloated Resource Hog,"The main problem with NAV 2k5 is the performance effect it has on a PC. I reformatted my HDD, reinstalled XP and wow, I was reminded how quick my PC can be. The minute NAV 2005 was installed everything became almost twice as slow. This is unacceptable for me. You cannot reconfigure this. In addition you will come across problems like 'ccApp is not responding' often. Take a look at F-Prot and PC-Cillin."
1,"Stay away, much better stuff available","This came pre-loaded on my wife's new laptop. I was not very happy with the laptop as it was way too slow (AMD 3000, 1g RAM) and about to take it back. On a hunch, I uninstalled the Norton Suite (demo license) and the machine booted up in seconds rather than minutes. Everything on this machine executes quickly now. That's enough for me. Do what I did, get a copy of Avast! (which is free to home users, but I'd pay for it) and be done with the performance hit."
1,Guaranteed to slow your Laptop!,"I loaded Norton Anti-virus 2005 onto my laptop and after restarting, everything slowed to a snails pace. It took 15 minutes to boot up after I loaded NAV2005. When I uninstalled it, I was back to my 3 minute boot up time. Come on Norton can do better than this!!!"
5,Peace of Mind,"The Norton AntiVirus 2005 expands its work by protecting your computer from internet worms, before they get into your computer, and also defends against spyware and certain other non-virus threats including adware and keystroke logging programs. That is a big change from 2004, providing great anti-virus protection and going outside that arena to stop other bothersome attacks.I have used Norton AntiVirus Software for years and have never had a malicious attack without the software catching the culprit and advising of the destruction or procedure to follow. Great software and a piece of mind to know that it is active on your compupter."
1,What a shame,"When I heard NA 2005 is coming out I was so happy because I heard its the best antivirus protection. I WAS WRONG! You see NA 2005 doesnt even find all the viruses, and if it does it just deletes them. And if you dont know deleting viruses doesnt help because they come back. The only good thing about NA 2005 is that it protects your computer from big viruses like Trojen viruses. Anyways dont waste so much money on some crapy product. Shure you heard that its the best solutions aginst viruses, well its not true. If you want a good anti virus programs I would suggest you get Ad-Aware which protects you agins Ad-Aware viruses. (and if im correct, you can download this program for free) Or get Spy Sweeper which protects you aginst Spyware viruses. Also NA 2005 lags your computer. So to get to my point, DONT GET NA 2005!!! Everyone who says this program is bad, they are right %100."
4,Ignorance is not an excuse,"As with most programs for computers you must uninstall the previous version before installing the newer version, unless it specifically says NOT TO. ""it didn't tell me too uninstall the old version"" is not an excuse, don't be the child that got caught saying ""I didn't know"" you know what you response to that would be.of the 6 reviews ALL had NAV 03. To those that plan to purchase... uninstall ALL anti virus software first, same with firewall. Two antivirus or firewall programs on one computer is like two people trying to drive the same car at the same time... chances are you will run into a tree."
1,I HATE THIS THING!!!!!!,"I used to be a big fan of Norton but now, I can see what quality dreck they put out. What a frustrating waste of time, money, and effort to try to get this thing to run."
1,Norton Antivirus 2005,"I purchased this product o/a 26 September 2005 and attempted to install it o/a 15 October 2005. It would not install as it recognized the Norton 2005 previously installed on my computer. It would not accept the new Key number, indicating a new subscription and would not process Live Updates. I spent the weekend talking to Norton, sending e mails etc to little avail. To compound the problem, I received an E Mail from Amazon advising of the release of Norton AntiVirus 2006 and would I like a copy? Needless to say I am not too happy with Norton. The product is outstanding but the 2005 version should have been pulled and not sold at this late date knowing that it would be a problem. The Norton solution: ""wait till your expiration date and it will install."" I do not recommend getting into this situation."
1,AntiVirus software a flop,"I installed Norton AntiVirus 2005 on Windows 98SE with a working Linksys network card in place. It collapsed my wireless network connection and caused my system to reject current hardware when a reinstall was attempted.This anti-virus software is so pervasive I still have not gotten it completely uninstalled.I eventually got my network connection back, tried to reinstall Norton ""just in case I had misjudged the effect"" and the system failure recurred. I have used Norton before with success but it's a bad combination with Linksys and Windows 98SE"
1,Better off with Virus,Program freezes up your computer as soon as it is loaded and restart. Couldn't get it unloaded from Windows. I would stay away from it. I think you are better off with a Mac or the virus.
1,Never again.,"Yesterday, I tried to uninstall Norton Antivirus 2002 in order to replace it with NAV 2005. Uninstall loaded and ran and claimed to have done its job.Then I tried to reboot. Result? Two registry errors, a warning from NAV's resident program (which hadn't been removed), three blue-screen errors, a ""system destabilized"" error, and a full system crash.It took a dozen reboots, a manual search and purge of every Norton and Symantec file on my machine, -and- a crash course in REGEDIT to get the last of NAV off my hard drive.I've returned NAV 2005 and replaced it with PC-Cillin Internet Security--for about half the price of a one-year NAV subscription."
1,Norton 2005 Screwed up my Computer!,"I have used Norton for years and when I bought about 3 2005 antivirus systemworks for my home and office computers, I had nothing but trouble on all the computers! I had to install and uninstall a few times and then finally hire a computer tech to fix the issues. I did not want to PAY Symantec to fix the issue for me and I was so frustrated that I bought so many and had to deal with weeks of problems. My son downloaded a renewal from their website and had the same problem. None of us could get online after the download and the computers were SO SLOW when they finally did start working. I can't believe Symantec charges a fee to answer questions on their product??!!! That just takes the friggin' cake. I will never buy this product again."
1,Do NOT buy this product!!!!,"I am a very experienced technical person when it comes to software installs and configurations. This product is the worst I have come across in a long time. I'm sure it will probably install on a clean system with no other programs running, but that is not a real world situation for a commercial product. Just do a search on the internet for 3019,5 as well as 3019,1 and you will see more than enough discussions about problems with this product. I even spent time on the phone with their pay (outsourced, know nothings) and they admitted to me they get plenty of these types of calls which they are not able to charge for since it is product related. Save yourself some time and energy and aviod this defective product."
2,Does not work well with Office XP,"I had one heckuva time working around a Norton AntiVirus 2005 incompatibility with Office XP. I got this nasty message when I launched Word or Excel: ""Norton AntiVirus 2005 does not support the repair feature. Please uninstall and reinstall."" I finally found some web postings to turn off the plug-in for Office XP to get rid of this error.I then got this weird error message telling me to reinstall Norton AntiVirus every time I boot up my XP home system. It turns out that if you change the default location for the Norton AntiVirus shortcuts in the Windows Start Menu, you can get some big time problems. This took a while for me to figure out and fix.In the past, I've had generally good experience with Norton AntiVirus products. But next time, I'm going to go back to McAfee."
4,Symnatec AntiVirus 2005,The product came quickly. It was easy to install by following the instructions. It works fine. I have Zonelabs firewall and it works fine with it.
1,Junk! Do not install on a notebook computer.,"I've been using NAV happily for a number of years but recently upgraded to 2005. Big mistake! This piece of junk crashed my computer, messed up my internet access, and cost me 8 hours of time to figure out the problem, uninstall/reinstall X 5 and finally reinstall Windows XP. I dutifully followed Symantec's tech support advice (which required messing with the registry) to no avail.On a positive note, I did install this successfully on a desktop computer at the same time and it seems to be running fine there. All the problems were on a 2 year old Dell Inspiron 4150 notebook.I have since bought EZ Antivirus by Computer Associates and am exceedly happy.Bye bye, Norton."
1,NOTHING BUT PROBLEMS!,"I'm very grateful that I read these reader reviews before I renewed my Norton 2005 Antivirus. I do have ME & I thought all my problems were just ME. Then I read that it's the combo of Norton & ME! ALL the problems people were describing, were mine also (Systems freezes, failed shutdowns, error pop ups, run out of RAM frequently, even though I installed more) For months, I couldn't run Live UpDate, I couln't run scan disk or defrag. I'm afraid I spent most of the year trying to fix my computer! I SO identified with those who said that Norton IS the Virus! I had trouble deleting it too, but SECURITY SHIELD gave good tips for that.(After ADD/Remove, go to MyComputer-CDrive-ProgramFiles-Common Files, delete Norton/Symantec & if needed, rename file & drag it to desktop Recycle Bin & Empty that. It worked! So far PCSecurity Shield(ViRobot)is working just fine for me."
1,Pretty Bad Product,"1- Unthinkable high consumption of resource2- Cannot uninstall without extra complex process which is difficult to find even in thier web site, just to raise switching cost for users3- Very few options of custom settings4- Not timely updates5- High sensitivity that rejects even non-virus file and deletes it"
1,Rebate scam,"This is a buyer beware alert. I bought the upgrade that comes with a mail-in rebate. Because I have been ripped off before I was very careful and thorough. I sent all the required components, including invoice, proof of purchase (the box end flap), and proof of previous version (the original CD). Symantec still denied me. I am weary of the tech industry advertising rebates and then not honoring them."
1,Disaster / waste of money,"On my Dell XP system, I was never able to install NAV2005, it hung. After a 45 min wait, I spent 3 hrs with Symantec tech support, but still not able to install. I'm out $50 and the computer has lost some functionality, e.g. the search engine has lost ability to search by date, file size, etc."
2,Bloated Pig Dog,I have been a long time user of NAV but upon installing this version on a lower end Dell machine the boot time almost doubled. It seems to work OK but it really is a hog. Seems slow and cumbersome. Better have a beefy machine before you buy this one. I have an old version on another machine and it is good but beware of this new version.
2,DON'T BUY THIS!,"When I had Norton Antivirus 2000 and 2003, tech support was good. Now it has apparently been outsourced to some other country, and I had a hard time understanding people on the phone. I was put through to technical support and was on hold for about 20 minutes, so I hung up and used email. The suggestions given on email didn't seem to work. It was supposed to download some software to check my PC; I gave it 1 1/2 hours and it was still doing the ""downloading"". I've just purchased another type of software that got good reviews."
2,2005 version is bad,Bought two copies. One computer had Windows XP with latest Windows updates but Norton would crash with errors. Upgraded to Windows XP service pack 2 and it finally worked. The second computer kept locking up the computer and we determined it was incompatible with the screensaver. Nothing else seems to be incompatible with the screensaver.I have used Norton Antivirus for years thinking it was the best but when the subscriptions run out I will be looking at different products.
1,Keep your old versions or buy something else!,Ever since I bought this my computer experience with it has been a living hell. It made my computer so much slower. When the computer boots it takes forever to load. The system scans take forever and sometimes it doesnt delete all the threats. I've recieved messages that a Trojan could not be deleted. What is really anoying was that while playing games online a kept getting a message that said a remote worm was accesing my computer- it popped up like every 2 seconds. Eventually I basically rolled my computer all the way back to when I had 2004.. No more problems. Its ironic that Norton 2005 is trying to prevent viruses that try to infect your computer but in a way it does that itself.
1,Do not Pruchase!!!,This 2005 version is full of problems. If you have 2004 just renew your virus update subscription. I am responsible for over 20 computers at work and the new version of Norton AV is problematic especially for machines not running XP. It is almost impossible to completely uninstall and there is absolutely no tech support. If you email tech support you will get a response in broken english that doesn't make any sense. If you like problems you'll love this version. It's sad to think how far down the ladder Norton has traveled. I highly reccommend Panda anti virus over Norton.
1,One Of The Most Irritating Programs,"This has to be one of the most irritating programs ever created.I have been using computers for over thirty years, so that is quite an achievement on the part of Symantec. Live update refuses to work--no amount of wading or should I say plodding through the ""Help"" has made it work. And now on a seemingly random basis the program insists that I haven't activated it.This program makes having a virus seem preferable to continuing to deal with Norton Anti-Virus.Peter, what have you lent your name to????"
1,Garbage,"Others have already described the details so I'll just add my voice to their's in calling this piece of garbage by its name. I've uninstalled it for the 3rd and last time and now have no antivirus protection. Yeah, I know this is risky but don't know what else to do. Perhaps someone will put out a decent product one of these days."
1,Nothing but problems.,"Had problems installing on a freshly imaged WinXP machine. Once I got past the installation issues it stopped working after about a week. Their web site said it might be because of my Audigy sound card s/w. However, that was installed prior to Norton. Luckily I got this free after rebate. Used the proof of purchase to get Zone Alarm for free. I'm a PC tech so the issues cannot be attributed to lack of experience w/ the product. Norton is not what it used to be."
1,Number 104,"8 hours, one person said they spent on this. I have spent at least that - maybe more - plus days and days of worry, and being threatened by BT to close my broadband account because I didn't have sufficient virus protection. I sent them this address to prove it wasn't my fault. I am in despair - I bought the PC-cillin after requesting a refund from Norton, but can't put it on cos bits of Norton 2004 are still on the computer and I can't get rid of them. If anyone from Amazon reads this, you should really withdraw this product - you're so much better than this.Wendy."
2,NORTON NO LONGER THE BEST,I am very very disappointed in Norton Anti-virus 2005Norton USED TO BE the best. BUT NOT ANYMOREI have used NAV for 8 years but they have apparentlybeen resting on their laurels and taking us for suckers because they now have a product thatis JUST NOT UP TO SNUFF anymore..I highly suggest you buy Trend Micro's PC-Cillin which blows Norton away or any number of other AV programs that are better and less expensive than this antiquated program...
1,BUYER BEWARE - Do Not Buy,"I have used this product for 5 years. When my subscription was up I renewed the product. When my PC started to go haywire I never suspected Norton to be the problem. Forget the customer service and any admission from Norton that something is wrong. I could not uninstall this progam in the usual manner. I found the solution in this review forum. I am now going to ask Norton for my money back. Uninstalling this product solved my problem. By the way. At one-point in my diagnostices I thought maybe I had a faulty install so I thought I will reinstall. Norton wanted an extra $6.95. Anyway, enough said. I will no longer buy from this operation."
1,Nightmare!,"I've always been a Norton lover. NO MORE. What a freakin' nightmare this was! If you use AOL don't bother with it...even back to version 7. You will *not* get online.And tech support? Good luck there! I spent a total of 7 hours on the phone last night between Norton (IN India-no choice there) and AOL techs (IN India-again no choice). Both claimed it was the other's fault, and I swear not one of them could walk and chew gum in sync. (Not to mention good luck in understanding what the heck they are saying to you: the accents are that thick)These big, greedy corporations have moved all the tech support to the third world to save money, and I'll wager they'll lose a bit from folks like me who demanded a refund & uninstalled this nightmare."
2,Never Use with Windows Me,Norton literally micro-managed my system. I couldn't even run a disk scan or de-frag because Norton modules were running. It sometimes caused my computer to shut down or restart. I spent most of my time looking at error messages. The best thing I ever did was uninstall Norton and start using the free Antivir software.
2,Get GriSoft AVG Anti-Virus Instead,My experience with the last several versions of Norton AntiVirus is that they really slow your system down. Norton AntiVirus is becoming bloatware.You'd be better off getting AVG Anti-Virus from GriSoft. It's a superior product and it's more reliable and less of a system resource hog.
1,If it were free I would not use it-BUYER BEWARE,Like many of the reviewers below I have been a fan of Norton Antivirus in its previous incarnations. This edition however is complete and utter garbage. I'm not going to waste my time trying to explain everything that is wrong with this software but will mention the three largest problems: (1)the program is so buggy that it is very difficult to even start a scan (2)once a scan is completed you cannot exit the program (3)if you try to exit the program it will start multiple copies of the program running. I have had to power down my computer to end Norton. Worse than many viruses.Someone needs to file a class action lawsuit against Norton for this garbage.
1,NAV2005 *is* a virus,"Not sure that there is more that I can add to everyone else's tales of woe, other than to say that I had NAV 2005 working on my laptop for a couple of months when, without warning, it would crash on reboot. Apparently LiveUpdate had ""updated"" with something that didn't agree too well with the rest of Norton Antivirus. And so the decent into hades began...uninstall (failed), reinstall (failed), delete files (if allowed), delete registry keys (did you get all of them?), lather, rinse, repeat. Two days later...I'm convinced Norton Antivirus 2005 *is* a virus. I cannot get rid of it; I cannot get it to work again; it has destablized the rest of my system. And what seemed drastic two days ago, reformatting my hard drive and reinstalling *every* other piece of software I own now seems like the path of least resistence."
1,Disappointed - 2 Years in a Row,"Norton use to be so good. But now, 2 years in a row, 2004 and 2005 I've had problems with the Anti-Virus - on DIFFERENT machines with Windows XP. This year the problem manifested itself after a couple of weeks. I'd get a message on boot up that Norton was having problems repairing itself and I should uninstall and reinstall. I did, and everything was fine for another couple of weeks -- then got same error message. This time on re-install it would not complete the ""uninstall shortcut."" So if I didn't undo the install there would be no way to uninstall later. Tried it again - same problem. So I switched to PC-Cillin 2005. I think Symantec is letting these programs out with TOO MANY BUGS. Add the pathetic support, and it's just not worth the hassle. I'd recommend you look elsewhere."
1,Do Not Buy,"This is the most high-maintenance piece of software I have owned in 20+ years of personal computer use. It's horrible. Really really horrible. Just keeping this piece of s*** (expletive deleted) operational on my computer is taking 10 to 20 percent of the time I spend on my box. This is an AMD Athlon(tm) 64 FX-55. I don't think we can blame its performance on lame hardware. I've had to re-install (a five-hour ordeal), back up and edit the sytem registry.I'd like to see Amazon remove this and all Norton products from their site.The only reason it gets even one star from me is because that is required.Do not buy.Oh how I wish I had read the reviews here before buying. But I've been out of the Windoze OS for over a year and the last Windoze box I had ran Norton with no problems. So I thought, go with what works. Wish I hadn't."
2,I'm done with Norton Antivirus,"I've been a long time Norton antivirus user and this is the last one I'm ever buying. Norton will destroy your system performance due to its hogging all your computer resources. of course, I couldn't even access the internet with 2005 installed; Norton's response was that sometimes this is a problem the software has. LOL. i switched to NOD32 and it blows norton away."
2,There is better AV software out there,"I've been a NAV user & supporter for about 5 years now, but recently I was struck by a major Trojan/Virus/Malware combo which crippled my machine for a week and a half. I'm disappointed to say that I had just installed NAV 2005 which failed to recognize, and thus, remove the threat before it could do its damage.After going through a painstaking process to clean my machine, I have since removed NAV and am now using Grisoft's AVG (better quality and, get this, it's free) along with Microsoft's AntiSpyware (also free for the time being. Though CounterSpy, which is not free of charge, is probably better).NAV is probably a good product for the user who does not spend much time on the web (thus the 2 stars). But if you're all over the place out there, I would try something more potent."
2,do not upgrade to Win-XP while using NAV 2005,"NAV 2005 worked for me since February.... then I upgraded from win98 to XP and it has been hell trying to get it to work.... had to uninstall it (I agree with others here that this is apparently IMPOSSIBLE) and now it will not reinstall... endless errors with no solution in sight (I have followed every instruction on Symantec's website). After working on it all day, I have given up."
1,This software is a Trash!!!,I had 2003 version installed in my PC. But after upgrade to 2005:1. The speed of virus scan become much slower.2. System is very unstable now.3. This software will keep your mahcine running like crazy for many hours but the processing will never be completed. The final result is: harddrive died.
3,norton review,"positivesdid not encounter any crashes or virus attacks, safenegativesmake your PC very slow, east lots of your PC memory and occupies more space"
1,DO NOT BUY!!! DO NOT BUY!!,"I HAVE ALWAYS NORTON ANTIV.. TILL NOW I BOUGHT IT YESTERDAY AND TRIED TO INSTALL IT, WHAT DO YOU KNOW WHEN I REBOOT AND RESTART BAMM.. WOULD NOT BOOT THE COMPUTER.. WHAT A PIECE OF GARGBAGE THIS IS. I EVEN WENT TO THE SIGHT TO GET SOME KIND OF HELP.. NOTHING TRIED TO UNINSTALL NOTHING WOULDN'T DO IT.. I HAVE TRIED EVERY THING.. ITS TRUE ONCE YOU INSTALL IT YOU CANT GET QUITE A FEW FOLDERS OUT.. THAT REALLY SUCKS.. THANK GOODNESS I BACKED MY STUFF BEFORE THIS INSTALL.. HAVE TO WIPE OUT THE DRIVE AND REINSTALL WINDOWS AGAIN.. WILL NEVER BUY ANY NORTON PRODUCT EVER.........."
3,Norton Gets Cumbersome,"Having used Norton's utilities for many years I am a little dissapointed in the latest antivirus software. In order to buy and installed the newer AV stuff, the older Norton software must be removed or your system will suffer numerous errors. Attempts to find Norton uninstall and remove the old AV software can be a real nightmare and using Control Panel Add/Remove will not work.No one should have to contact Norton support just to install new AV software and then have Techs (somewhere in India) speaking broken english try to explain that you should do a complete system recovery to clean out your systems registry and get rid of the programs Norton doesn't like, then install Norton."
3,WORKING AS EXPECTED,"I'VE HAD NORTON THE LAST 4 YEARS. HAVE TRIED THE OTHERS (McAFEE, eTRUST, ETC) AVAILABLE IN THE MARKET BUT PREFER NORTON AS OVERALL."
3,Only last 8 month or less,"Interesting how this filter is supposed to last at least a year but my rabbit air which is left on low 24/7 just shut itself off after 8 months, because of this filter became so clogged up. I have 2 cats in a one-bedroom apartment. For the filter to expire so quickly is a bit disappointment when the price of this filter is 45 dollars. Good filter but inaccurate description."
3,Effective but expensive.,"The Rabbit Air does a good job of filtering the air in my house. The downside is the overly-expensive replacement filters that are only available from Rabbit Air. If I had it to do again, I might have tried another brand with more reasonably priced replacement filters."
5,I wasn't sure if I needed to replace or not...,"The documentation says the HEPA filter is good for about 2 years, and mine was more like 16 months old. But, I had noticed that lately, every time it kicked into ""high gear"", the entire unit was making rattling noises. Cleaning did not help.On a hunch, I ordered a new filter. When I opened up the new one, and then opened up the Rabbit Air, I knew immediately that was the right thing to do. See, the old filter had slowly changed color as it aged, to the point where it was sort of a brownish orange color. The new filter was like the picture, a creamy white. I put in the new filter, and threw the old one away. Later, the unit kicked on and the rattles were gone.It makes sense now... the old one was so clogged that the fans were probably sucking air around the edges of the clogged filter, which caused everything to rattle.So, it seems that your ears may be the best determinate for deciding when to replace the HEPA filter."
5,SATISFIED,"I am very pleased with my Rabbit. I had severe coughing episodes before I decided to give it a try. It has helped me with that problem, and I have recommended it to a friend."
1,IT STINKS,"Literally, it stinks. I don't see the point in using this stuff at all, it did not make my hair feel nice at all."
2,Gorgeous on the wall...horrible to remove!,"I had bought $1000.00 worth of these ""Walls of the Wild"" fish decals. I put them up as directed with no additional glue. After only 2 years I decided to remove them. Today I have been peeling them, and all layers of paint, and top layer of dry wall for every sticker. I gave them 2 stars because they are gorgeous stickers. Just don't try to take them off...EVER! Now I must go and try to repair 4 walls. I did try the lighter fluid as suggested and it was stinky and did nothing to help. See photos I attached to customer images."
3,spoiler alert with question,"Could someone please tell me how it ends? I taped it, and it cut off when she ran out of her apartment after her ticket was found..."
1,Sadly disappointed in this product,"After reading the reviews, I was syked to receive my order of Ibarra chocolate. I love hot chocolate, and look forward to trying new flavors and brands. I've never had ""Mexican Chocolate"", so maybe this is what it is supposed to be like, but I didn't like it at all. It was hard as a rock, tasteless, and messy. I followed the instructions of boiling some milk, chopping the chocolate in my blender, and mixing it together. It came out foamy, like one reviewer described, but I was surprised to find it tasteless and flat!! I ended up adding 4 T. of my standard coco mix just so I could finish the drink. This was not at all what I expected, so if any of those three reviewers are looking for an open package, you can purchase mine! In one word: YUCK!!!"
5,A few corrections,"I just wanted to correct what some of the other reviews are saying:A. It's not an ""acquired"" taste, that kids will probably not like:I grew up with Ibarra, it was a once in a blue moon treat. I loved it as a kid and preferred it to Swiss Miss or Nestle or any other hot chocolate.B. Although I'm sure you can make Ibarra hot chocolate with a blender I have never once seen someone make it like that. It's really simple:Take two wedges and melt them in a cup or so of milk (any kind) or water and just whisk it or use a wooden spoon.Ibarra is may favorite hot chocolate. I've introduced others to it and they've never had a bad thing to say!"
1,Bad chocolate,"I received this product faster than anticipated which was the only plus to the product. The chocolate was old, crumbly and already turning white. A business partner of mine had recommended this chocolate, but I will have to wait to try it now."
1,NOT chocolate: FALSE LIST OF INGREDIENTS,"Extremely disappointed in this product. It barely tastes of cinnamon at all and is downright gross. My main complaint, however, is that it's not chocolate at all. It's a cake of sugar held together with dyed brown vegetable fat with a bit of cocoa liquor thrown in as an afterthought. Unbelievable that they market it as chocolate. And the list of ingredients on this product page conveniently leaves out the fact that it contains vegetable fat, which is clearly states on the package. It also does NOT contain cacao nibs, but rather cheap cacao liqueur. THIS PRODUCT CONTAINS TRANS FATS in the form of manteca/vegetable fat, also known as hydrogenated oil or Crisco. Don't let the legal loophole of ""0 grams"" fool you."
4,A Really Super Story,"I really enjoyed reading ""The Cool Club."" It was funny, interesting, and enjoyable. Although some parts could be improved, the book had an excellent plot and interesting characters. I would recommend this book to children ages 8-11. ""The Cool Club"" was both a well-written book and a really super story!"
3,Sonic Boombastic Rockabilly,"Westworld were a British band who played a strange combination of rockabilly & punk pop music, with a guitarist from Generation X and a spunky female singer. All the tracks live up to the 3 minute punk single ethic; short and sweet with catchy tunes and a singalong chorus. The biggest British hit on the album is `Sonic Boom Boy', which still has me pogoing around the kitchen and playing the air guitar! The rockabilly guitars drive nearly every track and each one could easily have been a single; the tunes are instantly recognisable and you'll swear you'd known them forever. Tracks like the singles, `Where The Action Is' and `Joy Rider' are excellent in a sing-a-long kind of way, but where Westworld really shine is on the ballad `Silver Mac' where the singing is so heartfelt you feel the vocalist is going to cry. It now sounds all very eighties but it is great fun anyway!"
3,Works but not too great,Mainly used to connect a logitech freedom bluetooth headset for using skype while running around the house. Also frequently transfer data from my Sony Ericsson S700i including movies and pictures.My opinion is that the data transfer is consistent but seems to work best at very close quarters. It didnot break connection at almost 50 feet through two walls and I think that was great but even at close quarters it sometimes would splutter and blank out for short duration. The headset is fine since I use it daily with my SE 700i without any problem.
2,Soledad,A daughter in a Dominican family returns home after her windowed mother develops mental illness. The story illustrates the daughter's struggle to fit in in the last place she wants to be. The book is a good effort for the first time author.
1,"Interesting, but a total mess","Hello, I agree with other reviews that although this dominican-american writter smart as she is could write something more appealing with more plot. I mean you start to read the book and you feel like you just want to finish it, there is not action whatsoever, it is safe to assume this at least in most parts of the story."
5,My favorite man on bipolar updates,"I have been a fan of John McManamy since he began his bipolar newsletter. I find his information useful and reliable and have found great books and many other sources of information from reading his newsletter. His new book is a welcome compilation of updated information which is complete in content and written in the usual McManamy style with a few ""zingers"" mixed in. I think some diagrams in the section on the brain and neurotransmitters would have helped, but his book is wonderful. Way to go, John!"
4,Very good book if you are trying to understand you're bipolar,"When you read this book I suggest 2 things. #1) You use a highlighter and mark everything that helps you explain your bipolar to your loved ones. #2) and use stick-it notes to tag those pages to make then easy to find your highlights.This book is very good at explaining the good, bad, and ugly of Bipolar. I like the sections on the meds and how they work.Also read, An Unquiet Mind by Kay Redfield Jamison,An Unquiet Mind: A Memoir of Moods and MadnessAnd get a subscription to BP Magazine http://www.bphope.com/ well worth it....All the best in understanding this difficult condition."
2,lots of medical studies,"This book sites many many medical studies and doctors, but provides little real help in helping you get better if you have bipolar disorder. Lots and lots of medical studies! I read the whole book and took about 1.5 8 1/2 x 11"" pages of notes. I didn't get that much out of this book at all. The best part of the book starts on page 345 at the back of the book. It lists lots of websites which can help you and family members with bipolar disorder. I think you would be much better off running a search on Google for bipolar disorder and checking at you local public library if you really want to read this book. I would check into other books first. I give this book about a two out five. Lots and lots of clinical data that means little to the patient."
2,Over the top,"The book has some good information in the first part, that provides useful insights into the problems faced by bipolar people. Beyond the first part I found the book to be lacking of much useful information. Some parts of the book seems more like a rag written by big pharma."
4,Very informative.,Very informative and easy to read. Must have reading for anyone living with someone that has bipolar.
3,Muscles Galore!,"If you're into ... martial arts this DVD is a MUST-HAVE!Me- I'm into gazing at magnificently 'sculpted bods & Ernie Jr.'s definetly qualifies. Ever since I caught his 'muscular offerings' in SURF NINJAS I felt it mandatory to keep tabs on his physical maturing. For example, in WHITE WOLVES 11, he ditches the earlier 'cut & chiseled' look & parades 'round 'bulked up 'specially in the upper body. Both 'looks' are real turn-ons. Here in ULTIMATE he seems to be somewhere 'tween the two tho most of the 'shirtless poses' are from a distance. No big deal- your ZOOM will allow you to study every inch of every muscle. What we have here GANG is a noted martial artist who could never act choosing instead to offer up a dizzying display of awesome muscle. Oh yes, the story line is weak & the other actors quite cardboard as well. The ... rating is here 'cause the reasons for my buying it were more than satisfied if you get my drift."
4,Well choreographed action scenes abound,"If you enjoy spectacular weaponry (short sticks), amazing kicks, and well choreographed fight scenes, this is the one! Admittedly, the plot is a little strange, we could have done without the cross-dressing antagonist ninny, and more development around the subplot of spirituality and the foster home would have made this a stellar film, but hey, it's a martial arts film. Worth a viewing for the well-executed fight scenes. Kimo (from The Ultimate Fighting Championships) does a good job as the unstoppable bodyguard. Also interesting is the presentation of several different styles of martial arts, including one from the Philippines."
4,"Same sound, GREAT ROCK","Status Quo continue to rock the world with another really great CD. I know the music has the same sound & beat but it is one to die for, as they said in one of their songs. We're ROCKERS ROLLIN."
4,A buccanneer on the high sees,This book takes a guess on the story of one of the most loved scoundrels ever to roam the seven seas of litterature. The research done in the process of the creation of this piece is quite well done. The book is exiting with all the strange and fascinating tales and stories the pirate experiences through his great and long carier. Long John is shown as the fully complex and complete character is person deserves. Indeed a deserving piece by a capable arthor.
2,Don't think teens will find it interesting enough to read.,"Catchy title - from Jefferson Airplane - and good graphics -- but I can't see my teen son actually being interested in reading this book, so it will not be much help as the guide/reference book I hoped it would be. It does address specific, troubling, teen issues and gives candid info on how to respond to situations -- but the book is not something, I think, that teens -- especially those it is intended to help - will use and learn from without parental oversight and guidance."
3,"Decent monitor, if you can see it.","If you want to use this monitor at something other than 1280x1024, you'll be disappointed. At 1280x1024, the images are too small to view comfortably."
2,"Inventive concept, painfully poor writing","I was looking for a good novel that interpreted 21st century geopolitics from a spiritual perspective. Sai Prophecy certainly presents a promising, inventive plot that follows the spiritual growth of several generations of one family and their involvement with the three incarnations of avatar Sai Baba and key political figures. Unfortunately, the author's writing skills are not enough to pull it off, as major plot shift after plot shift occurs with little explanation or justification. I also found the author's political positions naive and irritating -- the bad guys are Arab fundamentalists who undermine the spiritual greatness of America by cutting taxes and aid to Israel! The sections dealing with Sai Baba's influence on the key players are very interesting, but the character's emotional responses to actual or near miraculous events are treated so superficially as to make one laugh. I'm still looking for a readable spiritual/political thriller."
1,Poorly written jibberish,"I could not make it past the first two chapters without having to go back and reread the jacket and see if the praise written there really referred to the rubbish I had just read. This poorly written novel, trying so hard to be ""culturally insightful"", lacks any nuance and subtlety, particularly in its pro-Judeo-Christian, pro-Eastern spirituality slant and Islamist conspiracy plotline. This book plays on so many stereotypes it would be laughable if it weren't trying to pass itself off as legitimate literature."
2,Wishful thinking at its best!,"It's an interesting story that any good Christian, Jew or Muslim would be appalled at. If Sai Baba is based on a true guru, then he sounds very much like the Antichrist. Jesus says of the end of the age, ""For many will come in My name saying 'I am the Christ' and will deceive many. (Matt. 24:5) It's funny, I didn't catch that Biblical gem quoted in this book."
3,"okay, but too tame","I don't think many of these other reviewers have even seen this film! Instead it is a story about a man and woman trrying to decide whether or not to continue their relationship because of his inability to preform. Also, there is a tale told by a mysterious Indian woman they meet in India. She has a spirtual connection to the lead male.The two leads in the film are completely unappealing -- a real debt. The lead Indian woman is attractive, but we never see her naked. There is nudity in the film, but in the end we see only drawings of the kama sutra postions.The main plot line is boring. The story within the story is more interesting, but ultimately disappointing.However, I give it three stars because it was interesting at times and the photography, sets and costumes are wonderful."
3,Had alot of potential,The acting was fair. The outdoor shots were good. The plot line was the best part -- though it was under-developed. It needed some continuity editing. Scenes didn't blend well to next scenes. Music was interesting -- might be worth getting the soundtrack. They could have used some better dance training for some of the dancers though.
1,This movie Sucks Big Time,This movie is a super spoof of the real kamasutra. Watch at your own expense... not a movie to waste your dollars on!
5,It's impact will last years.,"I picked up this book over ten years ago. It really helped me to change the lens with which I view myself. Today I recomend it to the clients I work with. I find that it helps women deal with issues of self esteem in simple yet effective manner. It has excercises that are easy to do and have great results in changing how women view themselves. I highly recomend this for any women struggling with issues of depression, anxiety and or self esteem."
5,Self Esteem,"Great book, perfect for what I was looking for. Postage was fast. A great transaction. Thank you."
3,Man-bashing,"Although I enjoyed the majority of the book, I was quite annoyed with the constant blaming of ""male dominated"" society and culture. Although it is true that society and culture plays a role in a woman's self-esteem, I found that the authors spent too much time blaming men for women's problems. I am a little disappointed in the book!Good book...but it could do without the heavy amount of feminism."
5,No other book compares!,"This book is the one that switched me from fantasy to the romance genre!! It's been a year since I've read this book, and still, the characters remain fresh in my mind. If you want REALISTIC characters, fabulous romance, and writing with depth, BUY THIS BOOK!"
5,Wow...this is a love story,"What a great story. I was glued to every page and was immeshed in their world, on their journey and their ever growing love for each other. Sheridan grew to love the ""princess"" with every fiber of his heart and soul. Wow.....what a hero. He carried so much baggage that he could hardly go on living. This is truly his story. The chemistry and love scenes were sensual and soul mating. I love this author and recommend her highly."
3,"Love the author, not the book","Love, love, love Kinsale, just didn't particularly love this book. Couldn't get into the characters, the endless supply of far-fetched situations flew far beyond believability and it seemed excessively wordy."
2,Couldn't get through it,"Whiny, wimpy, dumb ""heroine"" and selfish, unpleasant ""hero""-- maybe these unlivable characters develop into better people later in the book but I couldn't slog through more than the first third to find out."
4,Purists Beware,"This CD seems to have all the essential tunes, but from the sound clip samples here, I have to say ""Natural High"" sounds like a redo to me. If you want the true original version of this song, look for the vinyl LP on the London label from 1972.Otherwise check out Rhino's ""The Very Best of Bloodstone"" CD, where you'll hear the original (though cut by a only a few seconds) recording."
4,Natural High,"That song is a classic and arguably the best on this album. There are other good songs here. However, I think if Bloodstone had stuck with their strong suit...the fabulous falsetto voice as the primary lead...they would have been far more popular. They didn't have an Eddie Kendricks AND a David Ruffin...just an Eddie...and he's at his best on Natural High. I don't mind switching off the lead from time to time like most 70's groups did, but Bloodstone didn't use their trump enough. Look at the O'Jays...they went with Eddie Levert most of the time and the Dramatics went with Ron Banks...The Delfonics went with William Hart, The Whispers went with the twins...and all of those groups were far more successful, and all still around today. When you say Bloodstone, most people think of Natural High, and that's it. Why? Because of that killer voice of a guy whose name we don't even know."
3,Avonlea 1st Season,"After watching the series, I was very unhappy with how each of the episodes has scene deletions. My wife and I recorded these shows on VHS many years ago and have seen scenes that have been deleted from the DVD's. We will look to other providers of this series as we and my family have enjoyed these programs."
1,Not whole episodes. Very Edited.,"If you think you are getting the episodes as you saw them on tv, you aren't. ""Tales from Avonles"" is not ""Road to Avonlea"" There are only 3 disks with highly edited episodes, as opposed to the 4 disk ""Road to Avonlea"" set. If you had never seen the first episode, the ending would be very confusing to you with major scenes missing."
1,A Huge Disappointment for True Avonlea Fans,"I have been looking forward to watching this DVD since I first found out that it was being released. When I put in the first episode tonight, I was extremely disappointed. Many important sections were cut out, including the two that explain Sara's decision as to if she is staying in Avonlea or not. As well, much of the background music is missing, which is incredibly noticeable for anyone who watched the show when it was originally on Disney channel, or who has watched the previous DVD and VHS releases of various episodes. These changes were not made known anywhere on the DVD packaging. There is no excuse for the changes made to the series, since at least some of the episodes have been previously released in their original form and quality. True fans should wait for Disney to release a ""real"" Season 1 set of this show, not settle for this poorly edited ""imitation""."
1,Editted Versions of original episodes!!!,I was so dissapointed when I watched the episodes on this collection. They are the editted versions of the originals that aired on the Disney channel. They look like they where taped off of the Hallmark channel and then put on DVD by an amiture!!! I'm returning mine to Disney! Don't waste your cash on this collection!!!!
3,Good for Jogging Memory Lane,"The whole is truly greater than the sum of the parts; there is no one element that rises to greatness. But these guys made music that still resonates with a place in my past, and that makes me glad I own the album."
3,"Give me the original, please","I guess I'm going to have to rip the original CD after all. I realize everyone knows more than the people who did the playing and mixing in 1969, but I can't listen to this version. I noticed the difference right after the intro in track 1, Across the Great Divide. The original loping Country feel of the song had been ""remastered"" into an annoyingly even, standard Rock n Roll rattle. There was a LOT of standard rock n roll in 1969 and what made The Band stand out was the unique rustic feeling of their songs. This ain't it. So, just a warning: if you loved the original mix, listen to the samples before you make the mistake I did."
5,One of the (if not the) greatest rock albums ever,"One of the few albums I own that I would never, EVER get rid of (the others: ""Pet Sounds"", ""White Album"", and George Harrison ""All Things Must Pass""). Most of the cuts on this album are excellent, the remaining few are above average. The Band shows a great musical flexability on this album; going from uptempo rock (""Look Out Cleveland"", ""Up On Cripple Creek"") to ballads (""Unfaithful Servant"", "" Rockin' Chair"") to country-Byrds ""Sweetheart of the Rodeo"" country-(""Rag Mama Rag"", ""The Night They Drove Ole Dixie Down""), and everything in between. A monumental album and definitely worthwhile to add to anyone's music collection."
5,Music from the poolhouse,"The Unfaithful Servant, King Harvest (Has Surely Come) are among the best songs ever written in the 60's. Amazingly this album was recorded in Sammy Davis Jr's poolhouse. Again, like Big Pink reissue, the bonus tracks are totally unnecessary."
5,"IF YOU DON'T OWN THIS ONE, YOU'RE NOT SERIOUS","I have a collection of more than 500 rock cds. This is my number one of all time. This has it all. Great songwriting about life and America (what other rock album has songs about: grandparents, farming, the Civil War along with songs about girls! ). Even the album cover is a masterpiece.If you don't buy this one, you aren't really serious about building a great collection..."
3,The Band brown album,"The CD was fine--sound quality good, no scratches, or other problems. But, the internal labeling of songs was completely wrong. The song titles were all from an Andrew Lloyd Weber collection (Phantom of the Opera). The music itself was by The Band but there is no way to select a particular track and know which Band song will actually play. Irritating, to say the least."
2,"Not bad, but still sounds digital!","I had high hopes for this remaster from Audio Fidelity. And for sure, it is not bad, and has it's merits. However, it is doubtful that this remaster was done from the true original analog master tapes, and even the liner notes are silent as to the source used, relying only on engineer Steve Huffman's name, gained through exhausting self-promotion.Sonically, it exhibits a smiley-face eq with prominent bass and a tipped up brightness on top, with elements of digititis on high transients betraying the likely DAT source. Or maybe Huffman just needs a better digital setup? Mobile Fidelity has their own, proprietary all analog tube mastering chain and only use true analog masters.Audio Fidelity should maybe use the excellent engineers of MOFI for their product. This one is good, but not enough of an upgrade over the current Capitol remaster to be worthwhile. Still sounds too digital, unlike the now defunct DCC. Pass."
2,One in Every Crowd,"I just never really got these guys. I remember when they hit the scene and everybody when banannas about the purity of the music and the ""back to basics"" stuff. Yeah I know that Dylan loved them and that is where the world first saw Robbie Robertson and the rest, but I just never could get excited about it all. I also own Stage Fright and several of Robertson's solo efforts. Nothing from these guys ever struck me as anything other than mediocre and never creative or artistic. They are just a band, The Band, they got that name. Oh well."
5,One of my DID's,"When this album came out, KRLA in Pasadena, CA were playing the single during the day, and album tracks at night. My buddy Dave got a copy of the album and we listened to it on a sleepover. I went out and bought it with my allowance that next Friday night and it remains a treasure. I knew nothing about them backing Dylan or their previous incarnation as the Hawks, but i was hooked! Sadly, 2 of the 5 are no longer with us and there is animosity amidst the survivors. But back in the day, they surely were, and always will be The Band!"
2,Disappointing!,"My expectations for the new Thomas Anders album was high since the success of Modern Talking... I guess I was wrong! The songs on this album reminds me of his old style with some songs similar to MT style, except not as good. The only good songs I can really enjoy are ""This Time"" and ""How Deep Is Your Love"". The rest are pretty plain. Only buy this album if you have a chance to listen to it first."
3,Not as good as I expected,"The book has very basic information, just giving explainations of how the car's systems work. It does a good job of explaining the differences between stock and aftermarket parts. But, if you are looking for serious modifications and step-by-step procedures you will be disappointed."
4,china jim reveiw,"The first 120 pages were excellent, exciting memoirs of being a young subaltern iduring the indian mutiny and the first opium war.This man worked his way up from the ranks and looting the chinese palice in pe king helped him to make his fortune.Unfortunatley the story peters out and the last 100 pages were rather manotonos, just memoirs of a staff officer, banquets,picnics ect.Still is worth the first 120 pages."
5,We love it!,This canopy is perfect! It was easy to put together and seems to be really sturdy and will hold up as well. I also like the fact that it allows air flow from the fan so the kids don't get hot while sleeping under the canopy. Purchasing another one for my other daughter.
5,Awesome!!,My 4 year old loves her new tent!! It is good quality and not that hard to put together once you figure out the directions. Good metal frame. It should last a few years for us.
1,Not what you might expect,"This is a book of photographs. But that is where the accuracy of the description supplied by the publisher stops. If you want a SMALL book of unclear photos, that is fine. If not, forget it. First - the titles implies you are getting photos of Buddha images - in fact there are very few of these. The blurb implies you are getting a useful and interesting work. You are not. There is no information at all on the sites and the single page of text seems to have been knocked together with no thought to context, content or purpose. You have no idea from the book itself where any of the photos were taken. This is a sad waste of effort and Shambala should be ashamed of themselves."
2,Wonderful theme - dreadful writing,"The struggle with forgiveness which Sr Amata encounters is a deep, moving idea. Yet the writing in this book is very poor. Both the conversations and the descriptive paragraphs reminded me of a children's book. I suppose the crude vernacular the nuns employ is supposed to be natural (Marigolds? Yuck, they stink!), but I found it very trying.The author clearly tries to incorporate varied elements: showing how all nuns struggle with selfishness and weakness; caring for others in the community; the varied paths to the contemplative vocation. It does not work in a book this slender. One is left with a brief reference, but no depth.It is unfortunate that a theme which could have been very powerful is clouded by the folksy language and lack of character development. About all one knows of the main character - let alone the other nuns - is why she fears ringing the bell. The instant healing as she finally does so does not ring true, either."
4,Good examples but not best for business purposes.,"I learned a lot from this book. It uses examples and case studies to drive home lessons on cultural literacy. If you are looking for a more business oriented book, consider ""Doing Business in the New Latin America"" by Thomas Becker. I can't make any recommendations regarding other regions."
4,Buy this Book!,if you are interested in cross-cultural intercultural competence this is a great reference. It's detailed and still fun and light.
3,Did what it is made to do,The ball mount by Reese does what it was designed to do. It would have rated higher except that when it left the factory someone must have tightened the bolts that need to be moved to fit the shank with an impact wrench. Once this was broke free mounting was a breeze and can be adjusted to fit the height of the trailer hitch height. All in all the Reese product is really 5 star.
3,This book is good but not great,I bought this book thinking that it will show me block style and the skeletal structure but it doesn't it just shows a bunch of poses. So if your looking for a book that shows you block style or skeletal structure move on because this book isn't it. But if your looking for a book that shows poses this book is it.
1,The deception lies in the fact you lose money believing to be entertained.,"Warning...spoiler!!!!So after watching this unsuspenseful, predictably plotted movie we find out the accountant gives up 20 million dollars just to be with some girl whom he doesn't even know...they dont even call it love and this adding to the fact he is wanted in the death of 2 people and the possibility of faking his own death! and hes walking around Spain like everything is fine! God one of the top 10 worst movies I have ever seen. Save your time and do something more constructive like take a walk, or run, wash the car, learn to play the xylophone...or rewatch Chinatown (which truly portrays ""deception"" at work."
1,Run it backwards--More interesting that way,"The characters in this waste of disc space are so cartoonish, they should have had Disney draw the movie. The nerdy accountant looking for love in all the wrong places, the slick evil charming villain with perfect hair and a psychotic personality, the damsel in distress. The only interesting thing in this movie was seeing Charlotte Rampling. That was interesting because if you ever wondered what a marionette's grandmother looks like--now you know, courtesy of Rampling. Charlotte on a sex date??? More like a carbon date. And yes, something you never ever saw in any other movie--just when the hero is about to be blown away by the villain, a revenge seeking woman shoots the villain from behind. And some would think cinematic innovation is a thing of the past! Wanna break up with your significant other? Make them watch this with you."

3,Nicely surprised!,"After reading a lot of negative reviews/comments, I almost didn't watch this movie. Glad I did, though. I found it to be smart, thrilling and sexy, and even romantic. Held my interest all the way through. Some people found it predictable, but I did not...I could have seen it going in several different directions and was guessing 'til the very end. In fact, there is an alternative ending available on DVD."
3,Different Take,Deception is an interesting movie featuring Hugh Jackman in a different role than the ones he usually plays. It is well acted and holds ones interest right up to the end.
3,Twisted Thriller -,"""Deception"" revolves around a drab life of a sad, lonely, young, trustworthy accountant, Jonathan McQuarry (Ewan McGregor). He finally runs into a man (Hugh Jackman) he thinks is a fun, edgy friend, who shows him around town, art and connects him to an exclusive sex club. McQuarry finds the woman of his dreams at the sex club, and soon the plot thickens as he is linked to her disappearance. Michelle Williams plays the beautiful blonde - who he only knows as ""S"" - he meets through the sex club. All McQuarry knows is that his life begins to unravel and become more than exciting after his new ""friend"" shows his real motives.The movie keeps one interested, you just have to believe the set-up. I was not expecting it to be as interesting as it was, due to reading some of the recent reviews."
3,ok until half the movie,"I was so happy with this movie until like half of it, then it turns so unrealistic that i felt stupid just because i was still watching it,(spiler ahead) guns and passports from nowhere and people finding each other in a very large city by coincidence and just at the right moment, they turned a very good movie into something so unreal that a 7 years old boy wouldnt buy it. just my two cents"
3,The new vintage of the unerring Noir Film genre!,"Deception is suspenseful thriller easily labeled as a modern Noir film that plays with the well known opposite worlds. One of them is a shy counter, whose presence is meaningless before the feminine universe who casually meets with a seductive lawyer who likes to play hard in all the contours. Gradually this luxurious world will engage our good kid and without realizing himself, he will fall into a sophisticated plan of murder and extortion.Along the nineties, there were three well reminded films that approached around this dichotomy: ""The Indian runner"", ""Bad influence"" and ""Fight club""Ewan Mc Gregor steals the show like the scared executive who reacts naturally before the blackmail. Hugh Jackman looks overacted at moments and Michelle Williams fits adequately for this role, but even the brief cameo of Charlotte Rampling ignites the screen during those six minutes.A film to watch in a rainy afternoon."
2,Deception is DECEPTIVE,"This movie starts out very promisingly and then descends quickly into B-movie territory. Unfortunately, the Producers, who include Hugh Jackman himself forget that all thrillers need good scripts and credible plots to keep going. The plot falls apart quite quickly after a nice 40 minutes, and all suspense goes with it. The premise sounds inviting, but the execution as the reviewer below me says, is lame. By the end, I couldn't fathom why these great actors were dealing with such a poor and implausible script.I realise from Woody Allen's SCOOP (also starring Jackman) that Hugh is really too nice of a guy to play a rogue or anything sinister. Ewan McGregor is in his usual form and it's a shame more couldn't have been done to give this more oomph. Mi-3 starlet Maggie Q makes a fetching cameo in this, but that's about it.Two and a half stars.PPS Amazon really needs to enable half-star ratings like Flixster"
2,Watching paint dry would be more exciting,"Despite a pedigreed cast, this boring and predictable thriller is short on thrills and feels much longer than it actually is. I had a sense of deja vu while watching it and realized that they plot is pretty similar to ""Bad Influence"" starring James Spader and Rob Lowe, which was just as bad. In a nutshell - gullible geek (Ewan MacGregor) is seduced into an alternate lifestyle by charismatic baddie (Hugh Jackman) and his life is never the same when he falls for a mysterious blonde (Michelle Williams)."
1,Decent Twists but Terrible Ending,"While the movie is somewhat of a slow builder, I found that the movie was extremely predictable. However, there are a few interesting twists along the way that made things interesting, but ultimately, the ending just leaves a terrible taste in your mouth. I want my 90 minutes back."
3,Okay...,It was just okay. The plot was good enough. Predictable in some instances. Some things were unsuccessfully just thrown in to make the plot 'thicker'. Just okay....
5,My Utmost for His Highest Journal,"Purchased for our daughter. Oswald Chambers' classic Godly devotions are always challenging, inspiring and anointed for Godly daily living. The handsome cover is an asset to any library shelf."
1,It was written in.,"I bought it as a gift and realized as I was about to wrap it that it had been written in! So, naturally I couldn't give it as a gift..."
4,Beautiful book,"As others have said of Oswald Chambers writings before, sometimes you need to re-read because they are so deep. However I love the fact that they are a small paragraph filled with a deep spiritual thought for the day. The only reason I gave 4 stars was the book had a little scuff on the cover when I got it- nothing big, but if I were gifting it to someone I wouldn't like that. I should note that the soft leather part of the book does seem to scuff very easily...I have already accidentally done so after reading it a few weeks. I think if it were bound in a glossy imitation leather (like most bibles) that would be better."
5,Leave a legecy for your children by recording your thoughts.,"The immortal devotional classic in the original language. Conveniently located section for recording your thoughts and reactions to OC's insight in the margins. Larger than normal print makes reading easier. I leave it open on my desk to get me started each day. Nothing more needs to be said about My Utmost..., the unique thing about this version is the space given for keeping a journal. This is an excellent gift new, but also as a gift to a child or grandchild years from now to catalop your spiritual journey for those that follow."
1,Sorry,"Sorry to all you champurrado fans, this is not the real deal, but an artificial version, and WAY too sweet. Please compare to others 'hecho en Mexico', and get yourself a 'molinillo' while you're at it! ps: I use almond milk to make mine!"
3,grammas little helper,I bought this one for the picture on the front. I thought it might reinforce my threats to send my naughty children to grammas if they don't behave.
5,Like mom's...but better,"This is NOT hot chocolate in the classic sense. This is a hot, chocolate beverage not to be wasted on young children or adults lacking taste buds. You have to be someone that really ENJOYS flavors, textures, etc. to get the difference or you might as well stir up some swiss miss."
1,Just OK,"I got this a few months ago with high hopes but it was barely OK, kind of grainy, did not dissolve in milk."
4,yum,"A friend, who grew up in El Salvador, made some hot chocolate one night. We all wanted know what ingredients he'd used - we loved the drink! This was not the Quik of childhood.I pop a piece into a large mug of skim milk - into the microwave for a bit/'til heated through. Mix w/ a small egg whisk and enjoy."
1,Big Disappointment,"Unfortunately, I came across a mention of this book that included, a couple of interesting paragraphs. I expected a stylish, rather high energy work. I agree with the review posted immediately before this one, you will not learn anything about investing strategy here. And Wanger's record has not been that good lately. Try Sy Harding's ""Riding the Bear"" and become a stock market strategist."
3,"Easy read, broad concepts - for the mutual fund investor","If you are looking for a book on how to pick small cap stocks, this book is not for you.If you are looking for reasons why mutual funds are better off than picking stocks on your own, this book will offer you many such reasons.Mr Wanger invests in what I would conclude as a fundamental-value style and indeed there are certain principles that a reader may be able to extract and apply to his own stock picking approach, eg investing in themes, buying value etc.However, the more I read, the more the book seemed to promote mutual funds for the lay investor. Depending on your personal preferences, that may indeed be the way to go for some of you.I offer the following quote from page 237 as a summary of this book:'Don't overpay, no matter how much you like a company. Invest in themes that will give a company a long-term franchise. Invest downstream from technology. Think and invest globally. Find stocks to own, not trade.'"
3,Humorous and honest,"This book is written by a man who has clearly seen it all and can still laugh about it. Mr Wanger is very entertaining, and at times very candid about his past blunders. The entries from his personal diary from October 1987 (we all know what happened then!) were fascinating. Now the down side: Not much hard advice for individual investors. This book might be helpful to mutual fund managers, but I manage my own investments, and I really didn't take away much usable information"
4,Investment philosophy of a long term winner,"Wanger is a bright guy with a good long term record of beating the index. He explains his thinking and his ""top down"" process for picking stocks. He doesn't give some pat formula for beating the market and admits that most professional investors (and funds) can't. I thought it was much better than reading a book about Peter Lynch bragging about his ten baggers."
5,"This is the best book on the market, it de-mystfies it!","Ralph gets away from the mysticism too often associated with Wall Street. He puts everthing in human terms and leads one to understand that skill and luck make good partners and be suspect when someone says they have a sure winner. This is the best book about the Street I have ever read and I put it ahead of my previous two favorites; ""One Up on Wall Street,"" Lynch and ""The Stock Market,"" Leffler. In fact I think this book and the Penguin Classic, ""How to Lie With Statistics,"" by Triffin, are a must read for both investors and financially oriented consumers"
2,This guy cannot write,Took forever to read this book. Hard to follow...disjoint pages from one project to the other. Each of the stories could be developed into a book but living it does not mean you can write about it.
5,I love this book! It is very inspirational!,This is one of the best books I have ever read. It details all the great games one can play with their pussy. I gave it as a gift to my girlfriend. She was very happy.
4,Cat Ownership Parody,Had this back 25 years ago and lost it. Found it again and it still is funny. The best chapter is on bathing your cat.
1,Terrible book,"Gave it to my girlfriend for her birthday and now she won't come out of the bedroom, kono isn't getting any play and he is not very happy."
2,good music!!!,This CD is great. It has a variety of music that you would love to listen to. This album should be brought back to circulation.
5,Great Artist with a lot of heart and soul!!,"MC Blvd is one of those underrated artists who can really sing and can write! I heard the song ""I Remember You Homie"" in Washington one night and ended up buying his music in Los Angeles where I Live. I also hear it on the Underground Oldies Radio Show in LA!!! Blvd not only raps well but he is an even better singer with heartfelt lyrics that are positive!! His beats are old school mixed with contemporary. I predict that once his music is more exposed he will become a big artist. I own his ""Love On My Mind"" CD and his ""I Remember You Homie"" CD that has a guest appearance by the late Roger Troutman. His other album has Barbara Mason as a guest artist!! I heard that there will soon be a box set or double cd on MC Blvd including some new songs in 2004!!! I am looking forward to that!!! I found his cd on a very informative website...www.itprecords.com I highly recommend this artist!!"
2,Disappointing,"I was a little disappointed with this book. It seemed like a sweet story, and, in some ways, it was. I didn't care for the age differences, but I enjoyed the plot.I was surprised at the amount of thinly veiled sexual innuendos. I read on, hoping it would get better, but it didn't. If you're looking for a clean romance novel with a Godly message tied into it (as I was), and expect to find it in this because it's a Love Inspired book, you may be disappointed. It wasn't graphic or horrible, and still far better than any secular novel, but I was still surprised."
1,Wrong belt,"When I ordered the dirt devil it said to order ""this"" belt with it - I just assumed it was the correct size. It is NOT - ended up throwing it away because it would cost me more to ship it back :( very disappointed..."
1,Poor Quality,These belts lasted only on day each; they just burst very easy. It was a total waste of time and money. Very disappointed.
1,Wrong advise from Amazon,"This replacement belt Style 12 was recommended by Amazon to be purchased with the vaccum (Dirt Devel Dynamite Plus)which was ordered at the same time. The vaccum actually requires a Style 15 belt not a Style 12, therfore the Style 12 as recommended by Amazon is useless.......Amazon also recommended a replacementF-1 Hepa Filter which is also incorrect, the filter should be a F-2 again useless for the vaccum purchased,thanks Amazon you're really ontop of things !!!"
1,wrong belt even though bought with a package deal,sentthe wrong belts and said it would be more to return them than they are worth so i threw them out
1,Item was returned unopened. No refund has been made.,The belts were delivered quickly but the vacuum they were purchased for did not ship. I returned the belts unopened and have not received a refund.
2,Ouch! >.O,"Ouch! If you have somewhat small ears, these are not good at all! They fit someone with an ear shaped like this >> O They're too big for the inside of your ear, but if you happen to have a large inside of your ear, these should fit fine. They didn't work for me, but they might for you. Good luck and enjoy."
4,Slapstick not Deep One Mythos,"If you're looking for a movie that follows Lovecraft's stories seriously than you are in the wrong place. If you are a hardcore Lovecraft nerd and want to watch a comedy/ action/ horror romp done by obvious Lovecraftians, than come on in. This is a low budget film following three friends on a modern day adventure. The effects are sub par, the writing is silly, and the acting is ""take it or leave it"" caliber. However in an odd way the film is charming and funny. Watch the trailer and it's hard to misinterpret what is in store for you. It's an idependant film done with a sense of love for the Lovecraft culture. In an era of bloated CGI movies with scripts written as a side thought it is nice to have movies come out that appeals to people with an off kilter sense of humor. By no means is this movie for everyone, in fact most people would not appreciate it, but for those it does strike a cord with, I say ""huzzah""!"
4,"Its a classic, but......","Pac Man in undoubtedly the most successful and one of the most influential video games ever, but today, the original game alone does not dignify the price. Lord only knows why the puzzle game Pac Attack was included in the GB version but not in this version-if they were going to package a Pac game by itself it should have been Ms.Pac Man, because at least in that game the stages change for a minimal amount of variety. Still, beneath the simple veneer lies an incredibly addictive and exciting game, and hardcore Pac Man fans never get tired of Pac Man's one and only board. If you are a Neo Geo pocket owner and a Pac fan and you dont own a GB, buy this. otherwise, check out the GBC ""Special editions"" of Pac Man and Ms.Pac Man which give more bang for your buck."
4,Pixel Perfect And Far Beyond Nintendo's Pitiful Attempt.,"I don't care if the Game Boy Version of PAC-MAN came with PAC-Attack as a bonus game. The NEO*GEO version of the classic sticks true to the original in terms of graphics (Even if Scrolling Is Enabled). Only a handheld system more advanced than the Game Boy like The NEO*GEO Pocket Color could fit the bill for PAC-MAN. If The Game Boy Advanced can deliver a good version I'll try it. But for now, only the NGPC has it Pixel Perfect."
2,The real problem is GoLive,"As a monument to unneccessary complexity, GoLive stands alone; (Photoshop is a snap by comparsion). This book tries to simplfy what cannot be simplified so those who need basic instruction that takes nothing for granted will be lost. On the other hand, those who want to spend their lives designing a web page will find there is so much complexity to GoLive that (obviously) a ""quickstart guide"" cannot cover it all. Put this on the bookself, next to ""Speak Fluent Chinese in an Hour or Less"". I found the GoLive Classroom in a Book slightly easier to understand--but not much."
1,Visual Confusion!,"This book has a great start. Then it slows down and the explenations becomes diffuse and sloppy. It is actually an art building anything serious with this book by your side. You will be better of with the help file, or perhaps some heavy metal..."
5,Great DVD collection of a classic TV series,I remember this series when it originally aired. This collection of DVD's is well produced and was a great bargin for the price.
5,The Hercules Series,"My Friends,I'm not much into shows like this one in most cases. However, after purchasing and viewing seasons 1 & 3, I had to buy season 2. This series is action packed, and, if you just happen to like Greek mythology, then, this would be a treat for you. I like the Greek myths that is why i bought seasons 1 & 3 and gave this series a chance. The series mentions most if not all the greek gods. Like Zeus The all powerful King of The Gods (Hrcules' Father) his step mother Harra, The evil queen of the gods, his half brother Aries,he's the God of War, and many more, you will also meet Hercules Mortal mother. Harra hates Hercules because he is a constant reminder of Zeus's affair with Hercules's mother. I rate this series a 10 out of 10tonyevans@cox.net"
4,Roots,"Listening to this cd you'll see where many of the new bands of today got some well ideas. Kommunity were one of the daddies of LA back in the day and this album proves how good it was done back then. And now that they're back and recording they can show their children how it's done. This is one of those albums and bands that made me wonder how anyone was able to label Marilyn Manson gothic. This album is a perfect example of what that scene really was and is. I recommend this cd to anyone who adores Christian Death, Ex-Voto, Alien Sex Fiend and so on. I even recommend this cd to the kids today who think Manson or Coal Chamber is all that because they wear makeup and like black clothing."
2,One Great Song,"10+ years ago I ran across the Kommunity FK video for ""Something Inside Me Has Died"" on MTV's 120 Minutes. It was being advertised as part of the album SCREAM: the Compilation (no, kids...not related to the movies). I bought that compilation of the LA scene and still love it today. Some years later, I came across Close One Sad Eye and bought it. Too bad for me. Only one great song, the aforementioned. Lesson: Buy the compilation, not the album."
3,"Wolverine, a dad with attitude","Antonio Sabato plays ex Navy Seal Harry Gordini, on vacation in Italy with his sexy wife and 10 year old son, has the bad luck of getting the wrong suitcase: one filled with drugs. He discovers this two days into his vacation while staying in an isolated (and picturesque) seaside villa. He dutifully turns the drug-infested suitcase in the the US Embassy but by now the drug dealers are on his trail. They kidnap his family and Antonio goes into action mode, getting them back. Of course, there's complications, double cross and plenty of gunplay. Movie cooks right along with Antonio doing what you wish you could do to those who dissed you. Ending's a bit of a letdown."
1,More Info Needed,"Every item for sale by this company lists NO VALUABLE information - and who waits 2-3 weeks for shipping to BEGIN? How about length? Width? Some indication on pendants of actual size? While the items look nice, the long shipping period, typos all over the listings, and the complete lack of valuable information about these products simply exclude EVERYTHING made for sale by this seller from my shopping cart. WAKE UP, Amazon.com! Who is the company you want us to buy from? Apparently, you don't know, either; nor are you monitoring your sellers. Very disappointed."
2,New formula = disappointing,"I've used Kiss My Face Pear Moisture soap for years and love it. Unfortunately, with this order I noticed the bottle has a new label and the product inside is very different. The soap is much runnier and runs right off your hands, unlike the old formula which was nearly as thick as lotion. The scent has changed too - to me it smells more like vinyl than pear. Finally, it is constantly clogging the spout on the Kiss My Face pump dispenser that I refilled.I contacted Kiss My Face and they confirmed that there was a formula change (removed paraben preservatives and synthetic fragrances). No longer the same soap - beware!"
5,Rules,My daughter and I thouroughly enjoyed this book. It gave insight to a growing disability and ways to treat those who suffer. Great book. Karen
5,Great read from a Maine author,"This book will not take you long to read, but it is worth it to purchase it. I am a public school teacher and found this book insightful into the lives of families that may have an Autistic Child, ...........you will laugh and cry and remember!!!!!"
2,NY Public Library Book Sent,"We received this book, but it had a NY public library sticker. Could it be stolen? Not sure what to do with it."
2,insteresting,"This book wasn't terrible but far away from good. It was reptive and quite frankly boring. I've heard lot's of people loved it but I just couldn't get into it. This book did make you think a little bit,but I think this book either strikes you the wronge way or the right way. I do not reccomend this book."
5,This Is My House!!!,"Let me start by saying, ""Thank you Cynthia Lord for coming into my house and giving me the insight to my 11 year old son's life."" Ok so I have an 11 year old son who is normal and an 8 year old daughter who has autism. My son is just starting to express some of the things Catherine does in this book. It was nice to see how you addressed it and covered her feelings so deeply.I also LOVE the way you showed, indirectly, how living with autism can be a struggle but also a blessing in disguise. The interaction between Catherine and Jason is very well done.This book is amazing and I am going to use it in my classroom to help show ""normal"" kids just how trying to live a normal life with a handicapped sibling makes every little thing a trial.I can't say it enough THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU for a very real, true to life, book about living with autism!"
5,Wow!,"I admit - the cover caught my eye - that's why I picked the book up, I read the back cover - I thought ""this would be a perfect read for my daughter"". I wanted to ""screen"" it before I gave it to her - I couldn't put it down! I have a son with Aspergers and ADHD - age 5 and my daughter is 8. I also am very involved in Developmental Disabilities Awareness/Advocacy/Activism. I also have a support group for parents of special needs children. I loaned this book (after I read it) to a parent that was having trouble with the same issues the book presents, her daughter, 8, was having difficulties dealing with her brother's, age 3, autism. The parent gave me back the book tonight with a smile on her face saying that after they read the book, her daughter has a whole new attitude and she is a much happier child! I recommend this book to anyone going through a similar struggle."
5,Amazing novel!,What can I say? This book is so wonderful. It is not very long and in fact I read it in a day. Great book and it will make you feel wonderful!
5,Some good advice,"I just bought this book today at my school's book fair, where I am a teacher. I am one of those teacher's that has trouble not buying books. I wasn't a reader when I was younger but now I cannot keep my hands off books. I passed this book two times this week, and picked it up both times, but I finally bought it today. I am really glad I got it. I know there are many times when I felt the honest feelings of Cathrine. What an amazing book! I will definately have to share it with my colleges and some of my students!!"
5,Shourl be required reading at all grade levels,"As an elementary teacher, I bought this to read to my students so they would know what the real world is like...and found the book very interesting and touching and funny....could be looked at on many levels all the way through middle and high school...as well as for adults...a definite GO BUY IT!"
4,A Message of Acceptance,"Catherine is your typical 12 year old. All she wants is a normal life with normal friends, not people who look at her funny or make fun of her autistic brother David. She loves him, but that's quite hard at times when she is embarrassed by so much of what he does. The only way to bring normality to her life is to make up rules, which she keeps with her in the back of her sketch book. Rules such as ""No Toys in the Fish Tank"", ""Pantless Brothers are Not my Problem"" are part of her everyday life.A new girl moves into the neighborhood and Catherine finally feels that she will have a chance at a new life. But will David ruin this too?Just when Catherine is overly wrapped up in David and Kristi, she meets a young boy at her brother's therapy clinic and the two hit it off in quite a unique way; opening Catherine's eyes to a life outside of the rules.I enjoyed this book and its overall message of acceptance."
2,Not so colorful is the best way to describe it,"That's a shame too. I really like Migs...his live mixes are incredible! But this album, it didn't really stand out. In fact, the only track I took from it worth spinning was Days of Color. That's unfortunate. Maybe Migs is too busy travelling the world spinning and being involved in other projects...heh, maybe he should stick to that.Sorry Migs, love ya man but don't love your cd."
5,Blissful Beauty,"Miguel Migs has done it again. ""Colorful You"" is literally a title living up to the sounds reverberating from this beautiful collection. The songs are soulful, deep, and thumping in glorious house rhythms. The infectuous grooves whisk you into a trance of blissful and soothing tuneful environs comparable to other Naked Music and Miguel Migs' releases.The only one let down is that ""Colorful You"" is not continuously mixed. All the songs are ripe for a continuously mixed CD. Nonetheless, it is a wonderful ""debut"" album of separated tracks by the deejay master himself. Thank you, Miguel!"
4,"Add Some ""Color"" in Your Life.","Having already established himself as a formidable DJ mixer on a couple of the Naked Music collections, Miguel Migs releases his own album ""Colorful You."" For 74 minutes, the disco ball spins consistently, unleashing multilayered grooves and tight jams that effortlessly ooze sophistication. Mid-tempo soul tracks with distinguished vocals also pop up, adding a welcome variety to the mix. This is more than an album full of beats and rhythms; it also excels in songwriting and production, demonstrating Migs' talent as not a DJ but a composer. ""Colorful You"" isn't the best release I've heard on the naked Music label, but it was interesting enough to keep me engaged throughout. The tag ""soulful house"" gets bandied about in marketing circles as a way to lure listeners to buy second-rate material unworthy of the title. But Migs is a true master of the game of house who delivers an album that makes yet another impressive Naked Music release."
3,Miguel Migs - Colorful You,"I greatly admire Miguel Migs as a producer and remixer. His deep house is touching, sweet, and oftentimes sexy. So I had great expectations for his debut, COLORFUL YOU. And in some ways, I wasn't disappointed: ""Brand New Day"" and ""Think It Over"" have his trademark deep and smooth sounds. But, to be honest, I was expecting more. Too much of the album sounds kind of the same, especially with the more downtempo tracks. The R&B version of ""Breakin' It Down"" doesn't hold a candle to the original, and ""Messages"" is kind of boring. And despite outstanding vocal contributions from Lisa Shaw, among others, the lyrics tend towards the cheesy (especially ""The One""). But the best tracks (""The Night,"" ""Surrender"") go a long way in redeeming the album. But for an album that advertises itself as COLORFUL YOU, I was hoping for a bit more than sixty minutes of a beige listening experience."
4,Great chill out,When I purchased this I thought it would be like all the other Naked Music disc with the house mixes. Well this is not it. I was surprised at how much I love it. Its great just to throw and on chill with. The fact that at least 5 songs have vocals by Lisa Shaw REALLY made me happy!! I love this cd.
3,Nice backround music but nothing to get your blood boiling,"Take heed: THIS CD IS NOT MIXED.Also, to echo some other reviewers: this cd pales in comparison to Mig's other work. Some individual tracks are nice, but without a flow they feel a little lost and unloved. If you are diehard Migs fan, then sure, grab it. Otherwise support his other more worthy efforts.As a sidenote: Why are so many of Mig's CDs so expensive? Ach!"
3,A step down from his earlier mixes,"I found this cd to be fairly nice, but it was definitley a step down from his mixed works. Nude tempo was among the best that I have heard from him. I highly reccomend smooth house fans to grab that cd instead."
3,Not good at all,I didnt like this book at all but managed to read it through. It just was too naively written with more than obvious plot.
5,"Sharp-swift story, delightful couple!","Imogen wanted more than anythign to be Dracco's bride. Yet a shocking revelation on their wedding day caused her to run off, leaving behind her brand-new husband. A few years later, Dracco learns the Imogen is in dire need for funds, and pitches a deal.He'll give her a million dollars to come back to him--and a million more to bare his child."
3,"The Art of Software Testing, version 1","There is a recent update of The Art of Software Testing, but I thought I start with the previous version.The $ 0,01 price tag certainly helped with that.Although this book is now a bit dated, the fundamentals presented are still very helpful.The quality of this old librarybook is as stated: good."
2,Pattern Failed,"Before, I was liking every other book that I read by Donald Goines and I thought this one was going to follow the same pattern. I started off loving it with the hijacking, but then the farmhouse scene was boring. Then the motorcyle ranch and Carol were extremely interesting, but then once that was done, I was bored again. On top of that, there were too many questions left unanswered. I was pretty disappointed with this one but I'm still going to finish reading his collection."
5,This is my first online rating. This movie is that funny.,"If Amazon had room for one more star, I sure would hook them up. Twin Hillbilly numbnuts on a road trip,they pick up this dude, and conversations occur. Madness ensues.As a sketch comic myself, all I can say is, 'enjoy this movie.' Better than Dumb and Dumber.Enjoy this movie with a corndog or two."
5,"Simplistic and funny, but requires undivided attention...","""It's sweet and it's cool"", it will tickle your ""brain meat""."
5,EXCAVATING ELVIS,"I compare this book to my two favorites; ELVIS & GLADYS by Elaine Dundy and AROUND ELVIS by Thorne Peters. Those books and this one show us that there are so many layers left of Elvis' life yet to be discovered. Like his music, we have barely scratched the surface of his being and the best is yet to come. These books show us what we've already seen in such a new light that it is fresh and vibrant each time you read it. These books reveal that Elvis' life was as multi faceted as he was multi talented. To this short list I would add IF I CAN DREAM by Larry Geller and LAST TRAIN TO MEMPHIS, by Peter Guralnick. In these books Elvis is shown to be a multi dimesnsional human and not the second coming. The more you humanize Elvis and see him for the man he was the more incredible he becomes and the more you realize just how phenomenal his acheivements are. In life and in death, Elvis is forever 2nd to NONE!"
2,Concerto No. 1 not on recording!,"The cover of the CD states that the Weber Clarinet Concerto No.1 is contained on this disk. It is not! It is the Concerto No. 2. Everything else is as advertised. Recording is not bad for $2.79, but it is not nearly the best."
1,They charge money for FREE software,"They are charging money for this software when ALL of this is available for FREE downloading off the internet. Something smells on this one, the Linux kernel 2.6, openoffice, and all the other 'so-called' new items you can get for free."
1,Be aware of 5 star reviews,"Suse linux leaves a lot to be desired, trying to get packages to work, or finding them and installing requires a degree in rocket science. Another problem, no software applications of any use are available, Openoffice just does not cut it and it does not convert files over correctly. Overall not a good time with this, just made me more aware of why MicroSoft Windows it the most popular operating system on earth."
1,One word frustration,"Ok, I can purchase a machine with Windows on it for free. But after listening to all the buzz about this one thinks he might try it out. If anyone thinks they are getting easy to use software and programs that actually work they are wrong. Most of them are totally useless and some don't even work. Just getting cut and paste to work right is a chore. Another problem is hardware detection, if it does not like it then you are just out of luck. Do yourself a favor and just use Windows XP Pro, it has to be the most polished operating system I have ever purchased. This linux software I thought was sposed to be free..."
1,Do you like working on a new car?,"Where do I start, it is like buying a new car and rebuilding it after you get it home. Broken apps, no movie players, burn a CD I hope you got plenty of time. Suse got me this time but not again."
1,The worst Linux distro ever made,"I've installed and tried many Linux distros as Linux hosts to create minimal Linux (only kernel and busybox, and that's it) to have better undestanding of Embedded Linux. They are Redhat 7.3, 9.0, Mandrake 9.1, 9.2, SUSE 7.3, 8.0, 9.0 and now 9.1. I found SUSE 9.0 flawless and the best among distros above.I purchased SUSE Pro 9.1 from Amazon in expecting kernel 2.6 is much faster than 2.4 due to its preemptiveness.Unfortunately, it's unable to configure desktop with white font color on dark background, like 9.0!Seriously, it took too long to open YAST (while I expected it's fast), I had to reboot, thenDISK BOOT FAILURE, INSERT SYSTEM DISK AND PRESS ENTERThis is the first Linux crash I ever had after so many Linux installations. I had to install several times for each Linux distro above.Certainly, this is my last SUSE."
1,Does not install,"Do not be fooled, you cannot even get this towork unless you want to spend hours on userforums and paying for support."
2,"This is Not one worth getting, folks. Wait for 9.2","Lots of bugs, lots of frustraton, in fact the worst distro I've installed. Won't bore you with details, just tell you not to bother with this version. Maybe they'll get it right in the next version."
1,Over priced and over rated,"For starters there is no way to get 3d hardware (videocards) to work under this linux or linux period. You might as well have no up to date hardware because there is no support for it. Second, all these applications are available 'freely' over the internet for download. Third, save yourself a lot of money and buy Windows XP Professional upgrade like I wound up doing. It works with hardware, plays games and best of all it has applications worth using that have standards. After all the linux bugs, hunting for answers on user forums, I said forget it.Windows XP Professional is the best overall operating system made."
1,Does not even compete with Windows XP Professional,"After Suse corrupted my Windows partition, my thoughts on linux sunk to a all time low. Beware of linux, it is not for anyone who needs multi-media. If you want to view, edit or even use any form of multi-media forget it. You cannot even play an mp3 in linux. What an overpriced heap of junk, after a re-format of my hard-disk Windows took over again."
1,Box is now crashed...,"I sit here typing on a laptop because my main pc is crashed thanks to this mess. The only error I get is a kernel panic and then it locks up. My Windows partition is gone, pictures, data everything. ARGGG, I am not very happy now at all. At least with Windows it actually works unlike this linux fiasco."
1,Disappointed,Should have done better job.More bugs than ever.I had Suse 8.2 and upgraded to 9.1 which I really regret.Move allong to Mandrake perhaps.
4,linux is free,why would you buy this when you can download it for free? all you are paying for is some of the applications that are licenced. you can download this and other linux distrobutions from linuxISO.org. if you don't have a speedy internet for big downloads (around 600 megs) then go to OSdisk.com and find a good selection of distros to order for a great price.
5,"Watch, Listen & Read","A friend of mine has a Hydrogen powered Vet, he gets over 60mpg.their are more advancements in computers and stereos, and video equipment.The advancements in the increase of fuel milage are PATHETIC. wonder why?Cars & Trucks today have more Power, more Torque, more Speed, but gas milage remains the same. wonder why?If you wonder why, then watch this documentary as well as Gas Nation.Then you will know why."
5,Eye-opening!,"Definitely worth watching.For a long time I've believed the gas corporations have been gouging Americans. This documentary reinforces that belief. It is very well researched and produced.There is so much evidence presented here - all I can say is ""Wow!""Sadly, I don't see any change coming. Politicians are bought and paid for with oil dollars. You can watch it in action in the video taken from recent Congressional hearings."
2,Really? Really?? Waste of time...,"The documentary authors do not understand theories and the patent process... This is a travesty. It peddles in BS for over 90 minutes. Look, we have an oil problem, we need newer fuels and better fuel economy. But get over the conspiracy theory crap! Absolutely absurd. The first part of the movie tries to convince the viewer that the technology has existed for a 100MPG+ vehicle in the 1940. Terrible, this move is sensationalism at it's finest.Other parts of this movie about the economics of oil are much closer to reality and offer a good view. It is, however, hard to stomach the movie to get to this more informative part.Lame."
1,not the best peak oil film,"The film mistakes the problems of peak oil and increasing energy demand for and get's confused with alot of it's 'facts', leaving the cause of high oil prices firmly at the door of big oil. The main problem is people need to wake up to a finite resource that is oil, if you want to watch a good documentary on peak oil I'd recommend A Crude Awakening, and give GasHole a miss."
1,Big oil is the evil empire,"There is no redeeming quality to this movies. Sure, big oil companies are selling a product in high demand and making lots of money. But the green movement is very powerful and also very profitable. Just check the net worth of Al Gore. The movie provided no evidence or science behind its claims. If bio-diesel was a cheaper, viable alternative, it would be used. The oil companies aren't murdering people and covering up technical advances in energy. If there were cheaper sources of energy, the market would dictate and it would be used. Even George Bush signed an alternative energy bill which has put billions into research and development of better energy technologies."
3,defective disc,"love this series, but when watching, one of the discs had a scratch on it, preventing it from playing in my DVD player -- a big disappointment."
5,"TV Series, Hercules - Season Three","I had received season one of Hercules as a gift and immediately became nostalgic for the happy times and memories when this TV program was on Saturday's and we made sure not to miss one episode. I wanted to add this series to my DVD collection, so once again turned to Amazon.com and ordered Season Two and Season Three, which were both on sale. Now I get to watch an episode whenever I feel stressed or just want light hearted, ""the hero wins the day"" entertainment. I plan on purchasing the other seasons as well, but want to wait until they go on sale on Amazon. Don't hesitate to make this series part of your collection, it brings memories of happier times and beats all the ""Reality TV"" nonsense that people now call entertainment these days."
1,Incomplete set,I'm thrilled to say my teenage son is far more interested in what he considers old classics than the newer series. He has slowly been collecting all available seasons of several of the older series and was beyond excited to receive the third season of Hercules. Unfortunately he was equally disappointed to find that instead of the entire set of discs from season 3 he had two of disc 1 and no disc 3. As my receipt was lost in the shuffle of Christmas chaos I've been unable to locate a copy of the third disc without buying the entire set again.
3,I bought it for one song,"I took a chance on this album. I had heard two songs off of it that I loved, one in particular begged me to buy the album. So, I did, and I was underwhelmed. The two songs I heard on Pandora are still favorites, but the rest didn't hold a candle near those two songs. I'd say buy songs from Nobody, but one-at-a-time. I know the album is a better deal, but hey, I'm just sayin."
3,This man has potential,"I bought this album on a whim when I was in New York a couple of weeks ago because I had heard about this guy called 'Nobody', and by the sound of it it was my sort of thing. On hearing it I enjoyed it, it has inventive and imaginitive beats and sounds, and creates interesting moods, with a psychedelic edge that sets it apart from many others in the field. However, for one it is quite inconsistent, by that I mean it doesn't 'flow' very well as an album, and I believe this is important (you may not). It also seems sort of unfinished, there are many loops that are repeated for time, with little development, but again this could be something that most listeners would not find to be a problem. Still it's not bad at all, and worth a listen to fans of the genre."
3,Its ooook...,"Its ok people. Anyone interested in Flunk or NOBODY well eventually settle with Daedelus for a release with non stop amazing tracks. Sorry to break it to you bu tthe only good tracks on this cd are ""wake up and smell the millenium"", ""Tori Oshi"" and ""Siesta Con Susana."" Peace."
3,STILL NO GOOD THEORIES OF SEXUAL ORIENTATION,"Janis BohanThe Psychology of Sexual Orientation:Coming to Terms(New York: Routledge, 1996) 265 pages(ISBN: 0-415-91513-9; hardcover)(Library of Congress call number: HQ76.3.U5B64 1996)This book is written from within the gay and lesbian sub-culture.It attempts to defend being gay or lesbianagainst the oppression of the straight culture.Janis Bohan reviews several theories of sexual orientation,not finding any of them adequate to explain the differences.No consensus has yet emerged among scientistswho explore sexual orientation.And some of the problems probably arise from the factthat we have no clear conceptof the phenomena we are trying to explain.Being gay or straight does not seem to bea rigid, unchangeable state of being.If you are interested, search the Internet for this bibliography:""Best Books on Sexual Orientation"".James Leonard Park, author ofImprinted Sexual Fantasies: A New Key for Sexology."
5,Nice piece,"I bought this as a gift for my wife, and we really like it. It's different, well made, and cute. I highly recommend it to any lover of our furry feline friends."
3,Could be better,I didn't like this book as well as some others mainly because the woman narrating didn't live in the house thru most of the book she just visited at times and it wasn't like a on going haunting. Also I feel she got away from the main topic of the haunting alot with useless chatter. It was o.k. but not the greatest.
3,Not enough on the ghosts,"This book did not explain much about the ghosts the author was dealing with, the book was filled with just unnessisary dialong and the authors fear of the paranormal she was dealing with."
3,Served its purpose,"I REALLY did not like this book, did not hold my interest at all and my instructor hardly even used it for my class, which was kind of annoying. I wish I would have just rented it from the school bookstore. The price was good on Amazon though, so for required texts, their new prices really can't be beat."
4,Good fighting game with some cool characters and moves.,I bought this game with the NGPC and I thought it was a reletively good game with OK replay value. It looks great for a handheald game. Many hours at work will pass by faster because of this game :).
2,A little disapointing...,"It's a 2001 dvd, so I hope the CZW product has evolved since then, because it is still a long way from being as professionnal as ECW was... Still, it gives us a good idea of what the indy scene looks like in the US... But, for 20$ and only an hour long, it is not worth it... I hope there will be longer and more accurate CZW dvds on the market soon..."
3,short,Good action and garbage wrestling but its only one hour long. Not much of a bargain or showcase compared to other companies 3-hour marathon discs.
3,GR8 CZW ACTION! BUT ONLY 1HR LONG!,"This czw dvd incudes 3 matches from their 1999 show entitled ""no rules, no limits"" im thinkin why dint they just include all the matches that were on the show insted of just 3 of them, the matches are not dissapointing though they include, Nick mondo & ric blade vs the backseat boyz johnny cashmere & trent acid gr8 hardcore high flying action, match no 2 is Wifebeater vs Nick Gage in a ""Fans supply the weapons"" match this match is crazy they even use a lobster! gr8 hardcore action. Match no 3 is Zandig vs Justice Pain again a pretty good match, the dvd also includes the history of the czw wrestlers nothing to special though. Overall this is a good dvd but it could have been so much better & longer cause 1 hour is just not enough hopefully when czw releases another dvd it will be a little longer."
2,They did it all wrong,"First of Digimon is anime and Fox &#65279;butchured it should of been un-cut and with the three complete movies instead of pieced together. Second it's not even in widescreen its in full screen. Third its a DVD where are the features. I want trailers tv spot, special, scenes. The movie was good but the DVD SUCKS!!!"
1,"Exciting, but...","Okay, this film it's exciting, but lets analize the facts, the plot is dumb!, and so are the characters,the animations is HORRIBLE, when i saw this cartton and movie i asked my self, Where is alln that lifeness that Anime gives to animation, well here there is nothing of that, the characters are very cookie cutter like, this film fails EVEN MORE THAN THE FIRST POKEMON MOVIE, and by the way who is saying that Pokemon it's extinct?, it's not and i can proob it if you analize www.imdb.com on Pokemon 2000 and Digimon the movie."
2,The TV show was better,"When I first watched Digimon on TV, I thought it was a rip-off of Pokemon, but I was mistaken. Digimon and Pokemon has the same point: Kids find little monsters with special powers. But unlike Pokemon, Digimon can actually talk!When I saw the movie, I didn't much care for the animation (and yes, its different than the TV show). The movie only makes sense if you have watched the TV show. If you haven't seen the show, the movie explains mostly everything you need to know. I would recommended anyone to watch the TV show before they see the movie however, beause the TV show was so much better."
4,Fun but a mish-mash,"Okay, so don't get me wrong. I like the movie, it was really fun, and I've passed it around to other people. Wonderful animation, action, etc. However, I would like to note that it is not a movie.It feels like three OAV's, maybe. That explains the different styles of animation for each story (for the third story, they seem to have gotten more money, because it was film quality), and the different story lines. The thing that really bothered me was the naration over the story who's sole intent seemed on bringing the 3 episodes together by talking about characters nowhere in sight, and some asides tossed into the dialog. I assume fox did this so it could be released on the screen. I know the Japanese production company that did Digimon, and they like classical storylines.So, yes, it was fun, but I suspect I might appreciate the original one better, and not have some imaginary thread tie them together."
3,All right,"The animation for this movie is sweet, and the storyline is decent - I liked this movie - but it simply isn't as good as the TV show. To really see the story of Digimon, the TV show is the medium for this story you should be watching, namely Seasons 1 and 2 (Seasons 3 and on were meh)"
5,Digimon the movie (DVD),"Though today there are many animated series that include animals and are sort of entertaining, like family guy, simpson's, pokemon, none are truly good becuase they are becoming dull and boring. where is the better shows? well digimon the movie was quite excellent, those who like digimon will agree. It's about friendship, loyalty and learning to depend on each other as the movie shows. You meet new characters who are funny and entertaining as they learn about themselves and what their digimon can do as they try to help a digimon who is caught under soemthing that was madeby pure accident. If you're trying for something from the 1990s to early 2000's then tyr digimon and other dvd's and watch and awesome an awesome serie."
5,Digimon Rules!,"When I was young, I thought Pokemon was the best. Then I heard about Digimon I liked it way more than Pokemon. The Digimon movie was great(It was way better than Pokemon,the first movie). I can hardly wait till it comes out on video! The Best part was when Veemon and Terrimon golden armor digi-volved.I also thought it was funny when Cocomon was dancing at the end."
4,Plot Holes,"Here's the movie in a nutshell:Part 1: Tai and Kari get a digiegg and raise it to Greymon to help fight Parrotmon. This is where the digidestined see the digimonPart 2: A virus digimon attacks the internet. When Izzy finds out and makes the distress call, on Tai, matt and TK reply. The virus breaks into the US military misiles and fires them in Japan. They've got 10 minutes to destroy the virus!Part 3: The new digidestined in season 2 have to get rid of the virus in Willis's twin digimon KokmonI give it 4/5 stars because it has cool sound effects and good special effects. Especially when the digimon digivolve. But a lot was cut out from the orgignal. Also there were a lot of ""holes"" in it"
1,What the?,"This is bad. I'm not sure what else can be said, besides this movie is an injustice to one of the finest Saturday morning cartoons ever. I really couldn't believe how terrible this movie was while watching it. The animation, good God what the heck!? Did the studio go on strike before this botched up colored sketching got polished up?This is a bad bad, disappointingly bad movie. Such a bad movie shouldn't be purchased by anyone, especially lovers of a fine show such as Digimon."
1,So What?,Hopefully this is the last movie. I wasted my money. The animation was horrible and immature. The plot and story sucked. The dubbing was worse than Pokemon. And the whole movie was just three 30 minite episodes slopily thrown together and called a movie.
1,Let's Burn this Movie,"This film is VERY, VERY, VERY, BAD, the plot is dumb, the animation is the most horrible I had ever seen, the music also is horrible, the characters are kind of very cookie-cutter like, let's just say that it was exciting, but not good, in fact it's not even exciting, this film has been the only one thar has given me a migraine, I am an 11 year old boy, please if you have any opinion on this review, please e-mail me at chmoreno2001@yahoo.com.mx, I will love to hear your opinion. Regards:Oscarito"
1,Take my advice....,"...Don't even rent this peice of crap. It's sooooo dissappointing, cause the show is really good. but the movie sucked."
2,A little bit disappointing...,"While this movie had its merits, it was overall disappointing.What the dubbers did was combine three completely unrelated thirty-minute movies into one long, drawn-out movie with a strange sense of pacing, and a confusing plot that will make even the biggest Digi fan's head spin.That said, I did really enjoy Chocomon and Gummimom's story, it was quite creepy. The fight scene was pretty cool, though I think that the animators don't really utilize very interesting camera angles or vary the perspective, which makes the animation seem a little boring.Oh, and one more thing that I thought was really quite unneccesary was the ""Angela Anaconda"" short at the beginning- very bizarre, and most unfunny."
4,It is just typically the same Digimon Movie..,"I'd have to say the uncut Japanese Three Digimon movies were better, but with the ""Angela Anaconda"" intro was just pathetic, but the movie itself was just fine. Although I'm not a fan of Saban's dubbing, and I am still not, they did an exceptional job on this movie. I'm not happy with the episodes, but the movie is just fine. They kept the same dark sadness at the end as in the Japanese version ""The Golden Digimental."" It would have been 5/5 stars if the dubbing was so poor, but the overall saved the movie and I must give it a 4/5."
2,"DIGIMON,GOOD SHOW OR POKEMON RIP OFF?","Sure,i like digimon but theres still something suspiscous to me...Did digimon COME from pokemon?I love pokemon so much but here is some things that realate to them:1.some of them look the same(espcially kyubimon/nintales.Both a fox with nine tails)2.Digivolve and evolve are the same(and when pokemon evolve,they don't turn back)3.poke-MON,digi-MONBut now to the movie.It's too long!2 things about season 1 and one thing about season 2.And two digidestiend have the SAME digimon!(henry and willis both have terriermon)So it really [bites] in a way.If you are a digimon lover,thats fine with me"
4,OKay Movie for people,okay this movie was really good i like it alot but i am becoming in paticent with the other 3 movies left that need to come out i saw the 4th movie revenge of diobiormon it was like a better verson of the 3rd movie so if anyone know when the other movies come out on dvd dubbed english let me know cause i am a digifan like seasons 1 2 4 not 3 cards ruin it
5,LoL get a life dude,"Man, that pokemon guy that lives in his mom's basement really needs to get a life. You should keep to where loers like you are welcomed and accepted...Star Trek."
1,uuuuuuuuuu......,"for the love of god!!!!! If you value your sanity, don't buy or watch this movie!!!!!!!!"
1,stupid stupid stupid stupid,Really really really stupid. i hate this movie. The worst part is when kari is in a scene. GO SEE THE JERK
1,Crap,u will hate this movie.kids will hate it and adults will be numbed. DIGIMON IS A RIPOFF OF POKEMON
1,It's Just as Bad as Pokemon,"The screechy dialog, bad music and the quickie CGI animation make this one a lot like Pokecrap. Granted, the animation is A LITTLE BIT BETTER than Pokepuke, but so what? That's the same as saying the animation is a little better than garbage. What really galls me about this Digi-detritus:1. The overall cheap, crass, overly-commercial attitude of the producers of this nonsense. 2. The fact that really good anime gets pushed aside in favor of this money-making operation.Digigarbage is an insult to a true Anime fan or anyone with a brain."
1,Very Sad,"UPDATED: AMAZON SUCKES. SURE, THEY GAVE ME A ""NO COST RETURN SHIPPING LABEL"". I JUST GOT THE REFUND. IT BREAKS DOWN ASFOLLOWS:Here's the breakdown of your refund for this item:Item Refund: $16.40Return Shipping Fee Refund Deduction: ($2.98)Restocking Fee Refund Deduction: ($8.20)We'll apply your refund to the following payment method(s):Visa Credit Card [expiring on 6/2014]: $5.22REALLY?? 5.22? A 50% RESTOCKING FEE? THIS PRODUCT IS DEEMED DEFECTIVE SINCE I CANT USE THIS MOVIE IN AN AMERICAN DVD PLAYER. AMAZON, YOU SUCK!IM HEADED TO EBAY. G'BYE AMAZON!I have written a review here on theis already. Anyway, I was shipped a UK version of this movie. Fearing I would have to eat the return shipping costs, I complained to Amazon and they have provided me with no cost return shipping labels.I wonder why a movie thats intended to play on UK compatible devices was shipped to a United States address is beyond me. I still want this movie, but I dont know if I will be shipped the right one."
2,Region 2...but still good movie,"I enjoyed watching this movie when i was younger, and i do enjoy it as an adult. I agree that the director/producers shouldn't of conjoined three different movies into one, but its to late to say so. The only problem i had with this is that i got fooled for purchasing a region 2 dvd, because i saw how low the price was from region 1 dvd. I requested a refund and return BEFORE they shipped it, but the owner didn't respond to me till after he shipped it over. Now for my return i have to pay the shipping back to them in the UK, is when i started getting upset. I requested a cancellation on the item i purchased, before it was even shipped. How come they didn't cancel it and put the item back on their shelves?Movie is great, but the shipping and the situation i'm in at this moment is unfair to the buyer."
1,"""Region Code Error""","I bought this and had it shipped to California, and when I put it in the DVD player it wouldn't play and said that there was a regional error. I want to exchange this for a different one or get a refund."
2,AreaCode??,"I am unable to watch this movie. Due to the fact that a message keeps popping up, saying ""Area Code Not Recongize"""
5,Exactly what I remembered,"I bought this movie for the soul fact that I was a huge Digimon fan as a kid and loved this movie. It arrived on time and I watched it with a big group of friends, some who hadn't seen it since our childhood and some who had never seen it. We all loved it. The majority of the people who hate this movie are nit-picky. If you just try to take it for what it is you will enjoy it!"
3,"I'm really happy that i got this movie,","but, it turns out that it's an foreign copy and i cannot watch it on my own tv because of the location code.There should be a specific announcement stating that it isn't an american dvd."
5,One of the most intriging movies I've ever seen,"I currently own Digimon and the 2 Pokemon movies. What I like about movies are that I can watch them over again. But the Pokemon movies, if I try to watch them over again, I can't. The excitement isn't as good as the first time. But when I watch Digimon the movie again, It is as good as the first time. That means it is not a boring movie and I would want to watch it over and over again. If you are a digimon fan then you would enjoy this movie. It has a lot of digi facts. If you have no idea what digimon is and want to see the movie, it is a good idea because the movie is very informative about before the movie and after the movie. So it is definetly a movie I would buy or at least rent to see. Jonathan Richardson gives it a 10/10."
4,Digimon The Movie from a level-headed fans veiw,"Digimon The Movie was a bit of a downfall comprared to the television series. In my opinion the type of drawing was undisirable. This is all I have to say downwardly, in other words, it is a very good movie."
3,Heavy Caseload,"There are just so many different cases available to store the Nintendo DS system for secure reasons. While there are ones that are just effective that they are just secure to be secure. Unfortunately, there are just ones that need a whole lot improvement. This Safe Case from Intec for the Ninetdno DS system, is a case that is a bit heavy to carry around, and it doesn't really secure the system to the best possibilty. There are better Nintendo DS cases than this one that are just softer and thinner, but also worth its price. This one doesn't cut the mustard.Price: CConvience: C+Overall: C 1/2+"
4,Really awesome,The screen is perfect and it is completely high definition. It's really almost perfect.. the best I've ever seen. On the down side when you first get it it's a little hard to use.. really complicated. But over all it's great. I would really reccomend it.
5,This is a great case!,"I bought this item because the idea of a hard case protecting my DS really appealed to me. I never really used the strap to be honest, but the few times I did it never broke on me. I keep my DS in the case almost all the time though, and I've dropped it MANY times. My DS is in perfect condition.I saw some bad reviews for this but even if the strap breaks it's still one of the best carriers out there because of the simple fact it's a hard case and excellent for protecting your DS.As far as putting the games inside the DS, I can fit at least 5 or 6 DS games in the little pouches(you can too if you place them properly) and still carry one inside of the actual DS. That never broke my hinges either.It's really more preference. My best advice -- since this product has worked very well for me -- is to buy a new one if your first one is somehow faulty, because I'm extremely pleased with it and I will definitely buy another one if my first one ever breaks(I've had it for over a year)."
2,Borderline useless,"I guess it'll protect your DS if you drop it, but this case has no room for anything extra at all. Even games feel like they're being crushed when you close the case. No room for your power cable, and you have to fold the wrist strap carefully for it to fit as well.On top of it, I don't even think it's alluminum...feels like plastic to me."
4,Tough on falls,Perfect for the child that drops things! (What child doesn't?) The only flaw is that it only holds a certain number of games. We like this case because it isn't too bulky. Any larger and you are carrying a suitcase. This is a nice size for smaller hands.
2,BROKE MY DS!,I got the case from my mom the strings broke off to much and most of all I put the games in the right spot and it cracked my hinge. My Ds is in horrible condishion because of this case. I would not buy it if I were you.
3,GOOD BUT NOT THE BEST BJORK ALBUM,"Bjork is the greatest but this album doesn't deserve 5 stars because this is her first adult solo album and is just the beginning of one of the most incredible musical adventures of the 90's.Bjork is a great artist and she improves every time she does an album. Debut is good but Post and Homogenic are better. Of course this album contains great songs like ""Venus as a boy"" or ""Anchor song""."
2,Hit and Miss,"This is considered one of the best electronic records of the early 90`s and one of Bjork`s essential albums. While it is innovative in some moments, parts of it already sound dated today, and a lot of songs aren`t all that interesting to begin with and turn out to be a bit irritating. Bjork sings in an unique way, no doubt, but it doesn`t mean that she`s always nice to listen to. A few good tracks appear here and there, such as the opener ""Human Behaviour"", the atmospheric ""One Day"" or the ethereal ""Come To Me"". Still, as a whole this debut is too uneven to recommend even if it is a somewhat curious album. It`s follow-up ""Post"" is a more well accomplished effort, this is just a fashionable product."
4,"INTERESTING ""DEBUT"" FOR SURE","On her first solo outing, Bjork delivers an amazing mixture of styles ranging from techno dance, pop standard, a dash of acid jazz and some dreamy balladeering. Her stylistic leaps may be hard for some to take, but for me they make for a very enjoyable listen. Her voice is all over the map, so why shouldn't the material be all over the map? Though not as experimental as ""Homogenic"" or as consistent as ""Post"", ""Debut"" is an important begining for one of the most important female singers to come along in a very long time."
2,Avante pop,"As we all know, Bjork became very popular following the end of The Sugar cubes. This first solo album walks a fine line between a slightly interesting listen to overall irritation. Musicaly Debut offers some wierd dance-pop tunes - not bad at all in some spots - Venus as a boy sounds like something from the far side of Neptune. What keeps this album down all the way is Bjorks constant misuse and abuse of her vocal capacity. The majority of the songs contain screeching and yelling. This really grates my nerves. Many singers know their vocal limits, but it seems that Bjork is indifferent. Oddly enough, this seems to be a major selling point to her fans.Recommended for those who like a certain wackiness to their dance music."
2,eh.......,"I hate to give a two star review, but this album doesn't make much sense to me. After buying her brilliant, flawless, amazing album ""Post"", I figured this would be really good too. The album's not bad, it's just blah. There are some good songs, but most of them are dull. I'm sorry bjork! Some of the pop dancy-ish songs are good, and the first song is great."
3,Not DVD Audio - 96 bit? Not according to my computer,I'm a big bjork fan - I'm also a big fan of the higher fidelity DVD Audio format and remastered CD sound (although some remasters are atrocious) - so I thought this disc was a great buy.From an audiophile (sound quality) perspective it's frustrating that the DVD side the lacks true DVD-Audio using MLP (Meridian Lossless) which is superior to the Dolby and DTS surround sound provided here. My computer was happy to read the DVD side but reports the surround sound as 48/24 for both Dolby and DTS not the 96/24 claimed. The CD remastering is fine - although not a noticeable difference from the original release which was mastered with CD in mind. Overall ... a bit disappointing.
4,Björk portrays the Reykjavík club experience,"Listening to this album, I am reminded of a Saturday night I spent in Reykjavík, which is, of course, Björk's home town.It's a rowdy, sensual place, full of excitement, skimpily-dressed girls, and gorgeous icy-blonde men. Everyone's out to have fun, and this album definitely does that.When I hear ""There's More to Life than This"", and she exhorts the listener to ""sneak down to the harbor"", I think of the throngs of clubbers I saw near Reykjavík's harbor, which is close to the club district. She speaks from experience!Parts of ""Debut"" are slow, but all in all it is a vivacious, fun album by a very talented musician."
4,Perfect,"If you want to hear some really good popmusic you have to listen to Debut. Lots of variation in it, ever number is different from the other. Personally I prefer ""Big time sensuality"", ""Like someone in love"" and the ""Anchor song"". Cool!She isn't afraid to use non-beat songs! thanks for the music."
3,Pretty Good Overall but repetitive at times,I like this album fairly well overall but at times it gets repetitive. It is a pretty good introduction to Bjork though and definitely has several great songs. I especially like the combination of sounds. Overall it's worth the buy.
5,Bjork's best,"This album is classic, one of the best techno/dance albums ever and certainly Bjork's best. She manages to be unique and original with arrangements, but still have wonderful, catchy melodies. This is an essential album for any Bjork fan, or music fan."
4,Necessary listening.,"""Human Behaviour"" was the first time I'd ever heard this woman's voice. Thank God for that happenstance. This LP folds you within it and you become one with the fibers contained."
3,Where's the theme?,"Bjork is known for making each of her albums radically different in one way or another, giving each one a distinctive style: ""Post"" is eclectic as hell, shifting from industrial to swing in a matter of seconds, ""Homogenic"" runs rampant with tension and surging dance beats, ""Vespertine"" is stunning, gorgeous, romantic fairy-tale music, and ""Medulla"" is made entirely out of vocals; with nary an instrument to be found. So what does ""Debut"" have to seperate it from the rest of the pack?Well, not much. Compared to her next 4 albums, it's quite bland and un-experimental. Not necessarily bad, but it's hard to imagine someone like Bjork making something so...""standard"" sounding. It's electro-pop, and decent electro-pop as well (no denying the catchiness of some of the tracks here) but all her other albums (especially ""Vepsertine"") utterly destroy this one.For big fans and completionists only."
2,Too Disco,"For all the talk of Bjork's experimentation and how ""cutting-edge"" she is, this album just sounds like disco to me. Manufactured beyond belief. You know, let's hire some trendy producers to make beats and then have this cute, kinda funny looking foreign girl with a weird (read as: annoying) voice sing over them. Future Bjork albums would improve on this formula (mostly by masking it in a faux ""dark"" atmosphere) but Bjork's music is still basically hollow. If you like techno, you might appreciate some of the tracks here, but after a while, this just sounds like Gloria Gaynor."
1,Man she scares the crap out of me!,"She just does, okay. She looks like an image from one of Marilyn Manson's videos, and I don't mean that as a compliment.I kind of wish she had never released a debut album, because without a debut album, her career would never have gotten started. She is the opposite of good. Therfore, she is bad, untalented, annoying, and untalented."
1,Complete and Utter Garbage,"I have never heard such a pile of nonsense in my life. If Bjork were not the darling of the arts and croissants crowd, she would be waiting tables in a sulfur reeking diner somewhere in Reykjavik. Save your money and buy a real record."
4,good for what they are,no frills (pockets would be nice) but good quality and arrived on time. No bleed in the wash so far.
4,Wonderful anime series -- a must see,"The Blue Seed series does not recieve much audience, and that's a pity. Its smart, savvy storyline has a unique depth to it: many of the situations (including the main plot) are directly from ancient Japanese legends. The characters, even though their initial roots are buried in the pit of cliche, are presented in a logical and sensible approach. The violence, which is most intense during the first two episodes, tends to be well-drawn and realistic. There's also something behind the gun-and-kill approach: most situations are not cleared easily by Kome's bazooka. It takes some thinking, which is missing in all but few of today's cartoons. An excellent series for anyone mature enough to handle brief nudity and realistic ""violence"", it provides quality viewing. Make sure you don't pass up on this!"
3,"Ok series, but oddly addictive","This is a great series for most people that enjoy anime. Even though this tape is not a prime example, Blue Seed is wonderful to watch and discusses the important issues of ecology and remembering one's historical backround. With good characters and an interesting plot line, this series should be enjoyable for most people."
3,Lots of fun,I've only had this a couple of days but it's alot of fun. I was pleasantly surprised by to popping sound it makes too.
4,Better for older kids,Good toy; I like that the balls don't come out too hard or go too far. It is too hard for my 6 year old to do by himself though. So I didn't give it great reviews since he can't play with it on his own. It'll be good for party games or something when older kids come over though.
3,I love Boris Vian,"he's the best French singer, he's wonderful!!! You'll never hear anything like this: he can be funny, tender, whatever he want to...And his speech is perfect!!! =D"
4,I'm a non-blonde,"It all starts when Annisa Gobrowski is starting her first day of school in a new town. She was a cheer leader at her past school, so when try outs started to replace to girls who got booted from the team, she decided to try out. With every one cheer leader against her, she still has the guts to try out. She succeeded, while becoming friends with those who gave her a hard time at first.This is the perfect book for any young teen girl, whether you're a part of the popular crown or not."
4,a stand out girl,"Give me a G!-G Give me a R!-R Give me a E!-E give me a A!-A give me a T!-T Whats that spell!!! GREAT!!If you want to read a good book you should read I was a non-blonde Cheerleader.It's a great book about the troubles of being a teenager and the trouble of moving to a new town.For Annisa moving to a new town is becomeing a routine.This time she falls in love real quick,his name is danny.I loved this book because I relate to it in so many ways.I would recomend it to 10-13 years old.This book is very special to me because I want to be able to have the confidence that Annisa has when I'm older.This is one of those books you'll find your self reading 30 minutes past your bedtime! If you're looking for a funny, awesome book pick I was a non-blonde cheerleader."
4,Hilarious,"This movie, when I first saw it, I was skeptical about it, but it is an awesome homage to the 50's horror flicks. My friends and I quoted the movie for weeks afterward, this is a good movie with good jokes and memorable characters."
4,Ha ha ha ha!,This is so much fun to watch with a group -- you'll want to share it with as many folks as possible. Not just for those who love 50's SF movies.
3,Sci- Fi fans beware,"As we watched this movie I couldn't beleive my daughter asked for it for Christmas. It was so stupid. But we have been quoting it and laughing our heads off ever since. We're planning a party to share it with our friends so they'll ""get it"" when we say a line from it. Great fun!"
1,Refreshingly Different...,"Siiri wrote:>>""Instead of winking at the camera and really overdoing it, the film-makers play it all entirely straight, which makes it that much funnier.""And that's one of the ""Lost Secrets of Great Comedy."" It's refreshing to me at least that not everyone has forgotten."
1,Ratings stars should allow negative numbers,"This movie is truly awful, even worse than the trash it is supposed to be a parody of. The only reason it gets ONE star is that Amazon does not allow awarding ZERO stars. If you enjoy watching tiresomely bad acting, cheap effects and costumes, then go ahead and waste your money on this film. The ONLY redeeming feature of the DVD is the commentary, and that is only because they discuss some of the sets and locations used. None of the information about the movie itself is worth remembering for more than ten seconds."
5,Campy Sci Fi Fun,This movie looks like it was filmed in the 50's with its low tech special effects but it's a lot of fun to watch and doesn't take itself too seriously. Great movie to watch when you just want to relax.
5,Abra-Cadavra!,"Delightful tribute to the blithely naive acting styles and earnest wacky-sincere science of the crazily entertaining '50s B-movies. Blamire and his troupe of legitimate and canny acting professionals (no, you can't just wing this stuff; you have to know HOW it was originally done and WHY it descends to us as quaint and quirky) keenly understand the faux-conviction that informs those old films and renders them so naively charming today. These talented people take the cheesy tropes over the edge, make you blink in disbelief, and then establish a new edge. Cheaply.Those kitsch-meisters of the '50s might have gazed forward with their atom-powered crystal balls, watched Blamire's movies, and actually learned something from them. I'm not sure what. But surely it must be up there on the screen... somewhere?All hail, to pseudo-scientists everywhere! This film is like your high-school physics lab, on nitrous oxide. Freaky-wise entertainment!"
1,"I love old scifi moves, But this is dumb!!!!","I love old scifi movies, ones of the 50's and so on. These movies can not be recreated, The style, campyness,retro soundtrackes,weird scfi music. The Lost Skeleton Of Cadavria proves this. This is the dumbest movie I have ever seen. A Lame atempt to recreat old style scifi movies of the 50's. The Attack Of The Killer Tomatoes. does a better job of recreation of 50,s type scifi movies. And this one is not that great, after seeing Lost Skeleton Of Cadavra, It makes Killer Tomatoes look great. If you want something like old 50's scifi try, Attack Of The Killer Tomatoes, you can stand it's campyness."
3,"Good, Funny but too long","This film certainly showcases it's love for 50's B movies. Lost Skeleton also relied on its trailer to get people in the seats, something done back in the 50's as well.While this film made me laugh at its witty dialogue and great (by great I mean stupid) characters. It did seem to go on tooo long. The film is short, but not short enough. I found myself skipping chapters after Chapter 19.Worth a rental but maybe for a $2 or less."
1,The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra,"Zero stars, actually. My new candidate for the-worst-movie-ever-made-by people-who-should-know-better. All the elements are there for a '50's sci-fi spoof. However, the script is a disaster. Like a bad SNL skit, the jokes go on way too long and are beaten to death (as if the audience didn't get them the first time). There are only two ways to do this right: Be very true to the genre, and A) have really bad amateur actors do a straight script; or, B) do a satire and have skilled actors who are really good at playing bad actors! This movie does netiher, and manages to be an insult to both fans of satire and lovers of so-bad-it's-good sci-fi."
1,Beware,"Beware, Amazon Videos CANNOT be Downloaded to a Mac! I recently bought this video to watch on a plane trip and I must first download it to my Mac (for obvious reasons). Well, you can watch it instantly on your Mac but, Beware, you cannot download any video from Amazon onto a Mac. I cannot rate this movie but I can rate the service. :-("
4,"If you think it's bad, then you're RIGHT!","My wife and I were on the floor nearly crying our eyes out in the first 5 minutes of this movie.Is it bad? ""Why yes Betty, it is bad."" The thing is, that it tries to be and pulls off being bad. Bad dialog, bad sets, bad costumes, bad special effects, well you get the picture. Actually the picture and sound quality are excellent.You really need to see Ed Wood, or Plan 9 From Outerspace before you see Lost Skelleton to appricate it. If you like movies, and can tell good from bad, as well as intentional cheeseiness from unintentional, you'll enjoy this movie.This movie should be manditory film study for all those fledgling movie makers out there. What NOT to do when making a movie."
4,Charles Mesure as the Archangel Michael,"I bought this because of Charles Mesure's performance as the Archangel Michael. Of course, the story of Xena and Gabrielle is epic, gripping, creative, funny, and very much worth watching, but I bought the DVDs because of Charles Mesure."
5,Great season for Xena fans,"The season is pretty much awaited. However, I did not see any new villains. It might appear that the producer was running out of steam up to this season and finally decided to put a close to the series. I was hoping that the end is where Xena and Gabriel were alive and they saw the result of their efforts to the humanity and finally decided to retreat to a seclusion, possibly or continue to lead a normal life thereafter. That would be a nice ending ...."
5,Xena Warrior Princess - Season Six,I bought this as a gift for y best friend. She and the kids watch at least one show of Xena every night. They all don't mind watching it over and over again.
5,The Final Season----,"Well. It had to come sooner or later. Season 6 of Xena offered all the best and the all worse the series producers had to offer. They had some of the best episodes: Who's Gurkhan, Old Ares Had a Farm, To Helicon and Back; and some of the worst, Soul Possession and Send In the Clones.The season 6 DVD offers extensive extras, such as commentaries and interviewss. But it also includes a behind the scenes look at the finale and some lost footage from the promos for the very first season.If you're a fan of Xena or you're new to the fandom, this is definitely a buy."
5,Awesome series!,"This DVD collection of Xena season 6 is an awesome series! Great fighting scenes! Great lessons to learn! Great visual effects and more! I love all the episodes in the series final year, season 6. Don't miss this DVD collection, a must buy."
5,Long live the warrior princess,"Xena will always be there to help a friend or anyone in need that has been wronged and will deliver her own justice to learn them the meaning of,""Be nice""!"
1,"Great Season, ruined by production...","I was so excited to finally get the final season, to finally complete my set. THEN IT ARRIVED! I was extremely disappointed! Bad color, short commentaries, the bloopers were a repeat (AND SHORT!). Overall, this is the worst release they have made.Kinda makes me feel like they were thinking, ""Well, this is the last season, we don't need to impress anyone, they have already bought the other seasons!!"" (GGGRRRR!!!)"
1,please help...,"I loved season six, but the production of this dvd set is terrible.Davis and Anderson Merchandising Corp are the folks who made it. Their website is www dot legendary heroes dot com, and the email for customer service is customerservice at davispanzer dot biz.I hope our complaints will be heard and they will fix their mistakes."
4,"Great season. Yet, another hasted, budget wasted mediocre finale.","This season was fabulous, as all characters that we know from the previous 5 seasons, that are alive, are given great maturing depth. And then the finale hits. And all is completely lost, in a panic from the staff that you can almost feel oozing from the screen as you watch this complete meltdown of ""HOW TO FINISH THE SERIES""!!!?? First, they take a show of SIX seasons, and take it to unfamiliar territory, with unfamiliar characters. Then, they SEPARATE all known characters. And in a quick flash, kill a character...but NOT with any sort of excitement or surprise that let's say, for example, Anya was killed in Buffy the Vampire Slayer. This was just plain POOR direction from a usually GOOD director, who will not admit to it... except to claim excuses of budget problems because of a musical canceled, blah blah. Arrogance at it's WORST."
3,good,"book shows Franklin still wants to play old games but Otter has matured and finds those things babyish, but soon they realize they are still friends."
4,GRAND DAUGHTER IS THRILLED,THE NEOGEO GAME WAS EXCELLENT IN THE WORDS OF A 9 YEAR OLD YHE GAME WAS CLEAR AND INSTRUCTIONS WERE EASY TO UNDERSTAND. SHE HAS COMPLETED ALL LEVELS AND WISHES TO HAVE ANOTHER GAME FOR HER BIRTHDAY.
4,Buyer Beware!,"I must warn potential buyers of this game, once you've played it, you'll be hooked! This is one of the most fun puzzle games I have ever played. For me, it's on par to Tetris. I even got some of my female friends, who don't normally enjoy video games, to get hooked on this game. Everyone that tries it, likes it. I can and have played this game for hours on end. Like a good book, it can be hard to put down. This game is a must have. Just make sure you can afford the time."
4,A great puzzle game!,"the object of this game is to keep little bubbles from overrunning the area by getting 3 of the same color in a row. The graphics are great. it is well worth the price. it is very fun, because you have to think quick, or the area gets overrun by bubbles."
5,Classy,"This is a very nice leather-type binder and very classy for coaching high school basketball. It was a gift for my assistant coach. The only recommendation I would have for Amazon, NOT part of the product, is to show both sides of the product online for those looking to purchase it."
3,Good enough,This is a good prep book. Not all that thorough. You will not be able to just study this book and pass. It is a good complimentary book. I really had to read many different books. But I passed each test the first time I took them. Just make sure you know concepts and you'll do fine.
5,Orignal Descarga by the Original Musicians,"Many people contributed to inventing mambo, son-montuno, cha-cha-cha, it wasn't just one guy for each. Cachao was one of the musicians contributing to Afro-cuban music in the 20th century. But I can't get over these recordings, made in Havana in the late 50's. The musicians on these recordings sound like the best of the best, who are really pushing the boundaries. It compares to any of what the best American jazz musicians recorded in the 50's."
4,Good Hard Rockin' Gearhead Metal Punk,"Muscle cars, drugs, racing... An excellent band with the typical late 90's American bar-band sound and theme , but with a twist: from Sweden!?Puffball have been around for nearly a decade and have numerous releases (most of which are difficult to find in the US--try Burning Heart Records' website). They have a very consistent sound from song to song and across albums. Good 70's style guitar riffs mixed in with the overtly Motorhead influenced ""wall of sound."" Their second release, 1999's ""It's Gotta Be Voodoo Baby!"", is the most powerful. I recommend all Puffball releases to fans of Zeke, Murder City Devils, Dwarves, Flamethrower, etc."
5,Quite unusual,"Is a woman worthy of teaching the laws of Yahweh?The question has created heated debates in Talmudic circles and among many progressive rabbis.The answer could be found in this breathtaking book.Of course, it is written as a thesis, however,a new approach to solve this critical occurence is proposed --indirectly--- without offending traditional minds.Read it. It is quite unusual."
4,"Righty likes track 16, whoot!","All of Stan's work has shown a deep suspicion of the industrial-military complex, heaped and blended with existential nihilism. I never took such a dim view of American life personally, but appreciated his artistic window into the darker side of society. For the record I'm a right-of-center, Republican-leaner who voted for Bush twice and I found track sixteen to be clever and, yes, a bit childish, but fun and I enjoy childish fun even when it steps on my idealogical toes. That being said the rest of the CD is delightfully quirky, loaded with imagery both dark and campy, and sprinkled with childish fun. And very true to Ridgway form this CD is yet another deadpan narrative description of the writhing scaly spectacle that is modernity's underbelly. It's kind of like David Lynch for the ears. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was that I didn't feel it rose to the level of ""Work the Dumb Oracle""."
3,Um...wow.,I love Stan Ridgway - witness my extensive collection of CDs and ticket stubs. I think he and Peitra are national treasures.However.....I have to say I found this album very hard to get my mind around. I am no stranger to music that is (more than a little) outre'. And I am willing to give anything involving Stan a chance. Several chances. But I honestly didn't enjoy this album. (Sorry Stan)But it won't keep me from buying the next one!
5,A truly wonderful journey!,"This is a truly wonderful book! Filled with a lot of feeling and perception yet written with atrocious honesty and gets right to the peak. It helps explain how we can deal with our ` Shadows "" (your dark side, amend ego, your dark twin, or your introverted self) This book will help you change your own awareness of the entire universe, others and yourself. That is what this book is all about, letting you see this universe, and helping you to hold all parts of yourself and start to be whole. When you are whole, you have no inner conflict. The steps outlined really need to be followed in order to appreciate what you can truly accomplish. This wonderful, well-developed works that incorporates concepts of others, but yet applies them in a sensitive, caring way. Full of emotions, affection, feelings and love."
5,Just a feedback from Europe..,"Every time a new book on personal developement subjects comes in Europe from the ""Young Americans Shores"" many here in the ""Western Culture's Nest"" think about another example of ""cosy"" new age common sense. Not now. Seldom I found a deeper study on the jungian concept of Shadow. Here I found a really effective and direct way to use it. Simple but not silly, direct but not banal, I strongly reccomend this book to everybody (like me) fascinated by light but also by darkness. Enjoy it."
5,Clears your mind to let you understand more about yourself.,"A wonderful, well composed, writing that integrates concepts of others, but applies them in a sensitive, caring way. This young author is full of feeling, emotions, affection & love and certainly has much to contribute to those whose lives she tounches either in person or through her book. The steps she outlines need to be followed in order to appreciate what she wants you to accomplish. By using examples from her own life and that of her immediate circle of friends, the reader can tell what a warm, understanding person she must be. There are a lot of feelings and wisdom that can be used to help many others who are open enough to try something new."
2,"Been there, done that","A repeat of numerous books and seminars on the subject. Could have been more ""user-friendly"" written. The author will find out more as her life unfolds. The paper quality of the paperback version is pathetic. As it is written, it does not hold reader's interest. It's all over the place. You have to hunt for the good stuff. A zillion people are acknowledged for helping to get the book out there - were they asleep? It could have been so much better. Good subject though."
3,Free Time,"If you have high hopes of completing all of the exercises that Ms Ford wants you to do, you better have alot of time and quiet. I am a Mother to 4 young boys and the only time I have to concentrate on these exercises were after they were all in bed. Then I felt the exercises were too much effort. You are suppose to be able to have a clean slate in your mind and go deep within yourself. I did not have the time or energy to put so much work into finding my ""evil"" side. I did not agree with alot of stuff she wrote in the book."
2,Reader Beware!,"Sometimes a self-help book can be a self-hurt book. Warning! This reader advises against doing the exercises in this book if you are feeling low -- especially if you do not have a trained and trusted therapist you can turn to for help.Also be aware that this is another book featuring a Marin County, CA process guru. These people live in a different world from the one most of the rest of us worker bees inhabit."
5,The book that started it all,"""The Dark Side of the Light Chasers"" is Debbie Ford's groundbreaking work. She makes the concepts taught by Carl Jung accessible to everyone. This book helps us to find a new way of looking at our life and our actions and helps us to learn to finally love ourselves."
5,Good Work,"There is a story in Native American history of an Indian chief who one night talking to his tribe tells them there are two dogs inside his mind. One a white dog who is good and courageous, the other a black dog who is vengeful and spiteful.He tells the tribe the dogs are fighting to the death. A brave, not able to wait for the end of the story asks ""Which one of them will win."" The chief responds ""The one I feed.""This book tells us how to feed the white dog. I loved the book. I would also highly recommend the book An Encounter With A Prophet."
4,Lasting Changes,"The philosophies shared in this book are significant. Unlike many of the theories written in other self-helps, Debbie provides the reader with tools that seem to make true lasting changes. I took the time to do the exercises and I believe I find myself on a brighter path of consciousness and contentment. I also highly recommend ""Open Your Mind, Open Your Life"" by Taro Gold. Excellent."
5,read at your own risk!,"Warning! do not read this book unless you are open to having your thinking turned upside down! Redeeming power and sanity : its all there, in one little package. You've read the rest; from Karen Horney to Marianne Williamson? Now read the best; I dare you!"
1,Getting to the Point,"I think this book has a good idea about facing your shadow, but it can be said in fewer words, maybe twenty pages instead of 179, with a list of the most effective exercises. What I dislike about a lot of these self-help books is they contain a lot of filler. And they all have that same style which you can almost predict. The authors would serve the reader and the book much better if they just got to the point and left a lot of the stories out. But I guess they have to fill the requirements of the publisher.I think more effective, is a book written with creativity and brevity. Books written by Chinese ancients come to mind. The ideas stick with you much better."
2,One More California Guru...One More Psychological Diet...,"When are we average people going to stop letting self-help gurus like this author cheat us out of our hard-earned money? I read the book with somewhat low expectations, and I was not disappointed!Maybe I'm completely out of touch with the rest of the world (i.e. California), but I hear one more Self-help Guru telling me that if I follow her psychological diet of nutritious nuggets I will shed the cumbersome load of stagnant mental sludge. She has some nice ideas but they are neither original or practical. I hear a hundred other psychoanalytical prophets speaking through her words. Just another psychological diet book for us mentally unfit savages!"
2,one of the worse books I've struggled to read,"This book is pure new age semantic babble. this book is a waste of the paper it's printed on. It's an attepmt to market to a genre that is noted for high sales. ""EMPTY pages"" best describes this book."
3,On My Own,"Since I am a Christian who believes in the healing power of my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, I think that one must have a strong spiritual anchor in order to digest the material, do the work,know what is okay and what is not, be okay, and still understand that this book does not contain absolute truth. In fact, many Christians would not even pick it up because it calls one to believe that he/she can basically go it alone. The author places emphasis on the Universe and mentions God a few time but I am not sure of which God she speaks. I read the book knowing that there is nothing new under the sun that things as generations and ages pass are just said in a different manner, in different words. If one were to read the Holy Bible, one could see that part of Ms. Fords book is a very abbreviated version of some verses of Psalm 139 and other Scripture. In all our getting, we must get an understanding."
5,Ford provides the missing link to mind/body/spirit wholeness,"There is no doubt in my mind that this book holds the key to wholeness for those on the personal growth path. Ford explains, in simple terms, why me must recognize and embrace our dark side in order to be whole. For the first time I was finally able to understand the concept of ""projections."" With that understanding, I no longer have to project onto others. I can love and embrace all of me which only allows more light in. Excellent reading!"
5,I owe this woman a good review,"This book should be mandatory reading for everyone. It teaches you that people are composed of both good and bad qualities, something very difficult for many (including myself, at one point) to accept.I still get tired of hearing people complain about EVERYONE ELSE'S mistakes, talking as if they have never done anything wrong in their life. I'd love to just hand them a copy of the book."
5,Brilliant brilliant book!,"I thought I was happy, I thought I was mature. I was looking for another challenge in life, so I picked up this book to see if there was anything useful. Whoa! This book made me realize that I have a whole other side to myself that I was not aware of. It made me understand what really being whole as a person is all about. I cannot say enough about this book! Thanks to this book, I feel I can really see the positive and negative sides of myself.I am using it to figure out how to get rid of the clutter in my life and embrace the simple beauty of it all. Another book that is really helping me now is 'The Ever-Transcending Spirit' by Toru Sato. It is another one of these terrific books that looks at these things with a focus on our relationships with other people. Both of these books are highly, highly recommended!!! Good luck to you all!!!"
1,Bad quality,"This jacket of very bad quality - it is inaccuratly made, everywhere stick out a thread, the cord in a hood is sewn up - to not pull out. Fasteners are sewn awfully-only half. I am very upset by this purchase, but unfortunately I can not send it back to the seller is very long"
4,Margaret Jensen doesn't disappoint,"Again, Margaret Jensen, comes through with a beautifully written, wonderful story with heart and inspiration. Her papa is not perfect, but still it's a wonderful tribute to a man who himself needs God's mercy and grace. Margaret Jensen is my very favorite author and through the pages seems like a friend as well. First We Have Coffee is my favorite, but learning about Papa was a treat too."
5,Papa's Place,"This is a wonderful book. I am still reading it! I have loved all of Margaret Jensen's books. They are very inspirational.Marilyn FitzgeraldCarlsbad, CA"
5,Nursing administration: managing patient care,"Using systems thinking, case applications by administrators illustrate the theoretical content in each chapter, assisting the reader to use ideas from the book instantly in their practice. Content includes political, legal, financial, marketing, computer applications, business planning, organizational design, outcomes evaluation, and health administration career building theories and applications. This book is currently being used by health care administrators in settings such as hospitals, home health care, public health, and long term care. As one reader commented ""at last I understand and can use the theories to help me make decisions every day."" Rated 5 stars by Doody, this book is a must for anyone responsible for managing patient care!"
3,"Affordable, but don't make this your only recording","The Point Classics label can usually be bought with closed eyes (or ears) but this particular Mendelssohn is not the ultimate. The Midsummer Night recording is done by the Süddeutsche Philharmoniker (although the cover does not clearly indicate who plays what). From a technical point of view the recording is interesting in that the stereo effect is very audible. However, it sounds as if either the orchestra was relatively small or the recording was done in a full hall, although there is no interference. The sound quality of the Symphony No. 3 is much better, but the interpretation could be more vibrant. At the price, though, nothing wrong with this CD."
1,Not what I expected,"I bought a similar design to this, and was quite disappointed to find that it is a paper cover over a regular plastic switchplate. The paper ripped when I tried to install it. For slightly more than this price, a nicer, more attractive, better quality ceramic, resin or metal switchplate can be purchased from another shop. Won't be buying from here again. I should have returned it upon receipt."
1,Not the Movie I ordered!,"They sent me the wrong movie! So I did not get to see the movie with Michael Ontkean in it! Bummer! I'm still to see the movie. How could they do that to me? I'm ordering Michael Ontkean movies on a Michael Ontkean movie wedsite, and they send me a movie that does not even have Michael Ontkean in it!"
1,Stay away,"This movie is poor film qua;ity, a borring story, extremely bad acting, and the gore effects are terrible. Not a good movie in any way, shape or form."
5,"""Extraordinarily insightful and moving music"".","This CD reveals that Classical American Music is alive, well and being composed today for our enjoyment and that of future generations. While all nine selections are great, the title piece, Ravenna and Nocturne in C# minor are the best. Most profound and inspiring, this music calls for introspection. Kirby's pianistic skill and technique are unequaled. I would like see more of his work available at Amazon."
2,cups too big,I ordered my normal bra size and the cups are too big. I would suggest if you order this bra go down a cup size.
3,Mavericks in American Music,"Interesting, but I don't agree with the basic premise. You should'nt ask for so many details about a customer's opinion of a book."
1,This isn't what you think it is...,"Plain and simple, if you're looking for the French film ""La Haine"" a.k.a. ""Hate"" (forgive me if i've misspelled the french version), THIS AIN'T IT. I don't know what this is, but I know the original wasn't a color film that only ran 26 minutes long."
1,Mega Mistake,"I came back to this during a search and came across the other review and investigated further and discovered he was right. I have never seen this movie, I thought I was reviewing ""La Haine"" aka ""Hate"". Please disregard my previous review on this particular movie."
5,ENTERTAINING,"Absolutely loved this series and it really captures early settlers in Australia, particularly during the Gold Rush. Lots of adventure as well as comedy. A good mixture of Australian and American actors. Hopefully the second and third seasons will be available on DVD soon."
5,One of the best series ever!,"I had had the VHS tapes of Five Mile Creek for several year and I re-watch them at least once a year. The actors are excellent and the plot is excellent also. I have loaned them to my daughter and her family and they also re-watch them several times a year. I would recommend them to anybody to watch. It is hard to not finish them in one setting. Your money will be wisely used if you want a good, wholesome series to watch!"
5,Five Mile Creek DVD First Season,"We are delighted with this DVD and the quick delivery of the package. This series is delightful, clean, family entertainment and to have it on DVD is great!"
5,Great to see this Creek,"When the Man from Snowy River was a hit for Disney. Disney channel invested in an ossie production, filmed on location with a local cast-It was a hitWith out any extras, this 13 episode first season is familt fare at its best. These espisodes is a great cast and great production values look good on DVD.It is great family fare that will never boreBennet Pomerantz-AUDIOWORLD"
5,Amazing series...We are ready for Season 2 and 3!!,This is such a great searies. This is what America needs right now. A good wholesome show to show our kids. Now we just need the rest of the story. PLEASE RELEASE THE REST OF THIS SOON!
2,"Keeps ""closing"" by accident, very irritating","I handwrite a lot for work and I write fast. This pen doesn't keep up. I think the design is flawed. Where you twist the pen to open and close it is too close to where you grip it to write, so it keeps twisting closed while I'm trying to write. It's very irritating.I've had other Sensa pens (granted, they cost way more than this one), where the twist mechanism is at the very top of the pen and that's a way better design because it won't twist closed when you write. I cannot use this pen for anything more than short notes, grocery lists, etc. It doesn't serve the purpose for writing a lot or writing fast."
5,I love it!,"Came in the mail very quickly. I absolutely love it! In perfect condition, as advertised, and as it is one of my favorite old shows, I can't stop watching!"
4,Hercules Season 1,"Programs are good; not happy with the manufacture's product (Davis Merchandising Corp).One of the episodes would freeze up and could not finish the episode; disk eight will not play at all, STOP is displayed on the DVD player and can not get this disc to play.We picked up Hercules Season 2 at Walmart; packaging is not as pretty but all disc operate and at a cheaper price."
3,Why bother?,"While it's great that this is being re-released, without the original 5 made for TV movies that start the series, it seems a waste. Even though the Anchor Bay sets are out of print on Amazon, you can still get all of them on [...] for around $20 per season. Brand new and 100% legitimate. That goes for Xena and Highlander as well (as all these Anchor Bay sets are also out of print on Amazon too). It's the official site of those shows and they keep the dvds in print. The season 1 boxset of Hercules is identical to the Anchor Bay set. It includes the 5 movies and the 13 episodes. why not just buy that? For the same price you get the same episodes, the 5 TV movies, and a CD-ROM of extras. I guess only the official website can sell it because no other online outlet, including Amazon, has it. Try there first."
5,Great Package Deal!!!!!,"For the low, low price you get 5-6 movies and the entire first season of Hercules. Plus it comes with an added computer disc with screen savers and more. 8 discs in all! I really enjoyed it!"
4,Good Show,"I used to watch both this show and Xena Warrior Princess on the WB. I liked them both. they were both very good action adventure shows that one of almost any age could watch. its hard to pull that off, but these two shows did it very well. Hercules is also good but i never found it as addicting as Xena. I liked Xena just a little more. I would still say that you should pick this dvd up today. its good."
3,its more lame than i remember,"the product is good, but the series is lame and unwatchable. i bought it out of nostalgia and couldnt get past the fourth episode."
3,Is the coin included?,"Do all the sets have coins?And who can I call to get a coin if its missing?Also, are the keep cases free?Thanks!"
4,Just too funny :),"It's everything I remember it to be. The corniness is just amazing. It's Kevin Sorbo, what more can I say....I had actually forgotten all about the movies before the series so that was kinda fun to watch them. You would really have to like bad tv to like this (which I do). lol, those fight scenes...just too funny.... :)"
4,Hec Fan,"I really love rainy sunday afternoons and old tv shows, so this fits right in. The shipper was so fast getting this to me I could hardly believe it. Wow now I just have to wait for rain - or not!!"
4,Hercules - Legendary Journeys season 1,"I thoroughly enjoyed this season of Hercules, I had not previously seen the first three telemovies, so that was a bonus, and had missed a couple of the episodes. The audio commentaries were good though it was quite obvious that Mr. Sorbo and Mr. Hurst had not recorded the commentary at the same time and this made it seem a little disjointed. It is always interesting to get the cast and crew impressions of what an episode was like and to learn a little about how and where the filming process took place. The video commentaries were a real bonus, to see what the actors look like off the set. Overall I enjoyed it."
3,Early Seasons Not As Good....,It's been quite a few years since the shows original run and I enjoyed it then....but I prefered Season 3 and up of the series...so glad Universal has been putting them out again.
2,"Unless you're really new to digital imaging, its too basic","Gauging by the general level of knowledge in my photography club, this book is geared for the newcomer to digital imaging. For example, it covers topics like choosing matte or glossy paper. Even photographers who use film have already encountered such choices. There is a light touch on calibrating a monitor and profiling printers, using online photo printing services and setting up your own photo web site. Anyone who subscribes to a photo magazine has likely encountered all of the same information before. Similarly, a simple web search on any specific topic will produce more detail than the book conveys. Overall, I was a little disappointed with the depth of the content."
4,Useful Book,"This is the fourth Tim Gray book and second Jon Canfield book I have bought and read. While this book treats many of its various subjects in much less detail as Tim and Jon do in their other books I still found it useful. The section on creating digital slideshows was particularly helpful and all of the other subject matter is covered at least a summary level, providing good review and synopsis of the more detailed treatments in their other books."
2,Not overly impressed,"One person stated, they saw a difference in one day. To me, it seems like a clear coat of nail polish would have the same effect as this product as all it seems to do it smooth out the filing marks. My nails are still peeling daily and chip with the smallest amount of contact with any object. When I remove the product, my nails look as bad as they did before. They are not healing at all, just growing out."
4,nail repair after quitting artificial nails,"I have worn artificial (solar) nails for over 15 years, straight. I've decided to discontinue using them, and of course have very damaged nail beds. So far, this product is proving to be exactly as advertised. I've been pleased with the results. It's going a little more slowly than I had wanted, but that's because I have zero patience. I would reccommend this product, at least as a first step. Follow the directions, exactly as given.Nailtiques After Artificial Treatment 3 piece"
1,"Where are the voltage, current and power specs ???","Where are the voltage, current and power specs ???There's no good excuse for the vendor not to clearly state these specs."
3,JUST MY OPINION,"I FIND THIS PRODUCT PRO AND CON. PRO, IT DOES PERFORM AS STATED. TRANSACTION WAS GREAT. CON IS IT COMES APART EVERYTIME I USE IT."
4,Kind of difficult to figure out.,"Ok,it works. Not real well (connection is loose) but figuring out what to use and how to use it was daunting. Never noticed all those 2pt. font symbols on everything before! Mr. Wizard (aka husband) was home so we got out the lighted magnifier and in about 25 minutes we had it up and running."
3,Solid little thing albiet a little show in charging,"It is a 5 for price and selection of tips. It is a 2 for length of charging, but leave it on, do an errand and your good. Overall, it is a 3. For those who are budget minded, need compatibility, and don't have to have it quick charged, this is a good deal."
1,"Does not work! Not ""universal.""","Set adapter to identical specs as the adapter I was trying to duplicate. Did not work. Tried with two other items (a battery charger and an answering machine), set specs accordingly using the correct adapter prong, and would not work with either."
2,Ack!,"Bought it; was completely happy and overjoyed that it worked perfectly--- several months passed and ""zap"". It suddenly died. Not so happy anymore."
1,It didn't work,"This set only has a few sizes to adjust the adapter. As Murphy's Law would predict, the plug we needed wasn't a size included in this package."
1,Underpowered and overpriced,"I love these for powering various random, rarely used, or found electronics.Specs are:""a wide range of voltages, including 1.5, 3, 4.5, 6, 7.5, 9 or 12 volts DC, with a maximum current load of 300mA.""Look around and you'll find 1000-1300mA units for less.Check your device for power requirements.(No worry about a higher powered unit burning out your device- your device will only use the amperage that it needs, but take care in the voltage setting!)"
2,"Useful book despite flaws, dated information.","This book provides basic information for learnig Esperanto, except for the attempted exclusion of the 'hx' symbol. Some extra readings add interest to the conversational-style lessons, and the glossaries are good, if limited. Articles on Esperanto clubs, etc., are, unfortunately, at least a generation out of date."
4,Quaint sort of history of the language.,"This is a fascinating book. It is useful as a history of Esperanto, because it was first written in the '40's. There is a great deal of information about the then-current groups of that era, as well as discussion about government and other organizations using Esperanto, and the growth of the language at that time.This book seems to have been written for the Esperanto ""traveler"" - the excercises revolve around conversations involving restaurants, hotels, and train stations. Not very useful, I think, in this day and age when the average hotel clerk has almost no chance of knowing the language. But the excercises are well laid out - not too much vocabulary all at once, and good dialogue in each chapter.What I most appreciate about this textbook are the notes on grammar. I have found these to be just wonderful help, very needed!I have really enjoyed this book and would recommend any Esperantist to get it if he or she can find it!"
5,SOUNDS LIKE ANOTHER KEEPER,"We have a woman with a secret - a seven year haunting.And a man with a past - five years of running. Can a child bring them together?Emma Delancy has lived in Haven, Indiana for seven years after being on the run from a hauntng horror.Noah Sawyer is a handsome newcomer to Haven, hoping to raise his little girl, Belinda in a safe enviroment.Of course Noah's first meeting with Emma involves the little orphan, Sean O'Dell from the Orphan Train. These children seem to meld many lives together.When a flash flood just about destroys Noah's farm, he soon learns what neighborliness is all about in Haven.He also finds a very strong attraction to Emma just about impossible to resist. Despite Emma's wariness she also finds much to love in Noah and his little girl.Ah you must read the rest -- HIGHLY RECOMMENDED ? - Add this to your must read list."
1,"Uh, whatever...","Man, I was so looking forward to Lisick writing something other than throw-way-pop detrius this time. Very disappointing considering she's had such a long hiatus since her last work, ""Monkey Girl."" Which I enjoyed...Pop images, pop culture, pop (...). We're tired of it. Get over it and write something interesting, please.Sure, she's a great performer. But in terms of writing? Let's get something interesting next time. Please!"
5,Amazing,"I love this album, I picked it up while vacationing in Paris and it has become one of my favorites. There is a wonderful range of emotions/tones you will run through while listening to this album. Some tracks are melancholy, some poppy, very elegantly put together. And his vocals smooth/breathy/not-quite-scratchy/yearning, a great balance."
4,A fun variant on Pac-Man,"As the ""official"" review indicates, this is a very enjoyable take off on Pac-Man, and the monsters are cute. The game is surprisingly difficult after a few levels, though, partly because the joystick reponse is not as good as it could be. SNK gives you a plastic ""ring"" to place around the joystick so that you have more precision around just four directions, but I found it helps little."
4,A great read!,"The dragon soars above the trees. The sun reflects of the multitude of scales covering the huge beasts back. It's great wings stretch as they beat against the air propelling the creature forward.....This Tom Clancy created book is an easy read and is entertaining.This series of books is aimed at the younger reader and takes you into the lives of a group of kids that are part of the ""Net Force Explorers"". The Explorers are a program created by Net Force, the agency charged with fighting crime on the internet.Follow the groups latest adventure as they try to figure out what's going on with one of the hottest games on the internet.This is an action packed story that kept me hooked until I was finished. Buy this book today, you won't be disappointed."
2,Way too hard,This game is so hard it takes away any fun. Its like people play games for recreation to have fun and relax not to be stressed out because the game is so hard its just like work instead of play. And also another thing that is bothersome in this game is that it is filled with long loading screens.
4,"Must have, though it may collect some dust...","Two words: AMAZING graphics! The ONLY downside is gameplay. If you are like me you will easily get bored with this game after much play. The car is virtually indestructible, and the vehicle controls take some getting used to. While the game has a lot to offer, I would recommend that you rent this one, or (better yet) buy it used. Admittedly I must say you will spend many hours enjoying this title, despite the very few shortcomings.To PS2 fans, think GT3 and you'll get a pretty good idea what this game is about!"
2,The worst PGR in the line-up!,"The game simply didn't impress me. On my previous XBox, I owned PGR1 and PGR2 and when I got my XBox 360, I bought PGR4. By far PGR2 and PGR3 are the best. Project Gotham Racing 3 just failed in terms of graphics and concept and if you ask me, the graphics for PGR3 are just as great as the graphics for PGR1 and generally that would be good but considering PGR1 came out in 2001, it is not a compliment. The game just isn't good!"
3,Is it fun?,"Is it fun? YEs. Should you buy it? Well if you need a racer at launch. Truly this is a beautiful game that you will only experience on the xbox 360. The graphics are definately better on the xbox 360. Want to drive down close to picture perfect replicas of vegas and other major cities? Get this game. Want an ultra realistic racer? Do not get this game. Want a game that is not completely realistic but which makes the game playable and fun? Get this game. Want unparalleled graphics in a racing game? Buy this game and use the view from inside the car. It is incredible. Is this game more fun than Burnout? Nope. Is it more pretty? Yep.Bottom Line: Is it worth the buy? If you can't live without a racer. If you can, Perfect Dark and Kameo are way more fun."
3,Its alright,"Game is alright. Graphics could be better and gaming could be better.Soundtrack is really bad. Overall the game is average, could go without it."
2,Lousy Lousy Lousy- NOT your PGR2,"Just an empty shell of a game. I am dumbfounded how they could have ruined it from PGR2? Online Cat & Mouse is useless, and the Last Man Standing just doesn't cut it. All the cars drive the same, the graphics are hard to see the road from the deep shadows- its just a mess."
2,better run boy,I think this game is bo.k. I think it doesnt quite do its job. I think project gotham racing is a wannabe. I think he needs to get a real job. I think this broke very soon after i got mad at it. I think this won't play in most cd players. i think the cover looks stupid. i think it gave me the idea to paint my car black and go around screaming danunununununun BATMAN! i think art is stupid. I think i don't recommend this but i sort of do. I think ive said enough. I think i haven't said enough. I think some people will read this. I think some won't. I think some people need to buy this. I think some won't. I think im almost done. I think some won't. I think ive said enough
1,Game does not work outside of US!!!,We could not get this game to work so we obviously did not have much fun with this game. I bought this game as birthday present for my sister's boys in Sweden. They have an Xbox 360. Unfortunately they could never use the game because of some idiotic limitation built by Microsoft in not allowing US Xbox 360 games to work on European Xbox 360 machines and vice versa. Amazon site and product info there does not make that clear at all. I had no idea. There is no way of knowing this. I think this stinks. My sister's boys were really dissappointed in not being able to play this game and the game sits now and collects dust. They and I are very upset.
3,Not able to do split screen online,"Sure the game has great graphics and sound/music, but if you have someone next to you that wants to play online you have to take turns, both cannot play at the same time. In PGR2 you were able to do split screen and race or do cat and mouse online, but they have taken that mode off from this game. What a shame! Only buy this if used, do not spend the full new price of $49.99.That's all I have."
2,It's 2013... The game is from 2005. Feels like it's from 2005,"Odd physics, clunky racing, random drifting, hit-wall-spin-out-lose-three-place-last-lap style races, crappy car selection... Overall, I played the game for about 45 minutes before I got bored and frustrated. Remember Need for Speed Underground? Drifting was great there and well executed however unrealistic as it was. Forza just took drifting out all together and made the rest of the game flawless. PGR tried to do both with allowing you to pull off moves, but did it poorly. You either break hard, not at all, early (causing you to understeer into a wall) or late (causing you to slide careening into a wall). Slow acceleration of any of the cars in the game makes it pretty boring. Like I said, about 30-45 minutes worth of gametime before you put it down for good."
4,Very good game...,"Project Gotham Racing 3 is a very good game...and only that. It is not great, but very good. The graphics are amazing, the cars sound great and look great, and the tracks are fun and well-thought out. The only place where it lacks is its lack of variation. The tracks begin to feel the same after a while, and you start out with almost every car in the game...all you need is money (credits). The worst part of this game is that you cannot customize the cars...at least in the Need For Speed series you can trick out your car any way that you want. Overall this game is a 4/5 stars...it performs well, looks great, but needs customization. Hopefully in PGR4 you will be able to modify the supercars."
4,PGR3,"Fun game with realistic graphics. Even more fun when playing utilizing system link. Takes some getting used to, but after that, much fun."
3,"Good game, not a bad choice at all","Here we have a pretty cool racing game that has many tracks, cars, and other features but only has moderate as opposed to high-end graphics. The scenery is okay, but lacks in comparison to the 4th game and so does the overall graphics. The fourth game has better graphics, more vehicle selection, and more features. However, since this game is cheap now (used and new), go ahead and give it a try...I still enjoy playing it along with the fourth. :)"
4,"Worth every penny, including the ones saved!","I had purchased this game two weeks ago from time of writing and I have to say that I enjoy this game, especially considering it was a ""bargain bin"" title.You start out with about 85,00CP when you start and as you progress through the game, you'll acquire more funds. There's also a ""Kudos"" system that'll reward you for doing things like power-slides, drifts, and also racing ""clean"" (In other words, ""driving without 'crashing'"").The only gripe I have with this game is the amount it takes to complete the game. I had just received my 360 from the repair center in Texas and within two days, was able to complete the game on ""normal"" difficulty. However, the more difficult you make the races, the more challenging it seems, but is worth your while.In closing, I strongly recommend this game for anyone who had just received their 360 and doesn't have much money to splurge on newer blockbuster titles."
3,"Yay, little wolf!","The language of this book is rich and melodious, and it is mismatched with drawings that lack depth. This is a feel-good tale that anthropomorphizes the runt of a wolf litter to deliver a message of self-esteem."
3,MARRIAGE PATTERNS WORLD-WIDE,"Bernard MursteinLove, Sex, and Marriage Through the Ages(New York: Springer, 1974) 639 pagesA comprehensive survey of marriage practices world-wide,from ancient to modern.Newer books will be found on this comprehensive bibliography:""The Best Books Critical of Traditional Marriage"".Search for this exact expression on the Internet."
3,Not the durability you would expect.,"I bought this for my girls since they LOVE to draw. It started out fine but a few weeks later, a leg broke off and no amount on wood glue, etc...was able to keep it from falling off again. The kids finally just used the bench minus one leg. We also found the the benches, while they do hold an adults weight, tend to tip over fairly easily if the kids wiggle at all. I also agree with another review when they said that pen and markers WILL stain the table and it is next to impossible to get any marks off of it. It is a good art table as long as you can put up with a few incoveniences."
5,Excellent table,"We have had this table for 2 years now and my daughter (the artist) is now 6 and uses it daily. My son (age 8) has no problems fitting with her at the table when they create. The most that has happened to this table is some glue that refuses to lift and some scratch marks my daughter made when tracing with scissors. After 2 years, I have to say I am impressed with the durability. It is a true artist station as well with many places to put supplies. The investment is worth every penny for the amount of use it has received and continues to receive."
3,Not sturdy enough,My [...]daughter likes to climb on top the table. One of the legs broke off in just less than a month of owning it . still trying figure out how to repair it
2,"Looks Great, But Didn't Fit Together","The table looks great and my son loves it, but not all the parts fit together. My son and I had lots of fun putting it together until we got to the read paper role holders that screw on underneath the table. One of them doesn't line up with the screw holes in the table. I'm going to have to get a power screwdriver and try to just screw it into the wood directly. Hopefully it doesn't damage the table."
5,easy to assemble and very nice,"This is a really nice table for kids to color, draw, paint, or whatever else they want to do. The only problem I had was the threads in the nut that goes on the paper roll was cross-threaded. i had to use a tap/die set to fix, but no big deal really. i'm sure it isn't too common of a problem."
1,Arrived broken!,"The art table arrived with the wood on the side broken. When I called amazon, they said that we'd have to disassemble it, obtain a box and re-pack it, and be home to coordinate a pick-up from UPS to obtain a credit. That creates an unreasonable amount of work for us to a solve a problem that is not our fault! Amazon should stand by their products, stand by their (many) outside vendors, and send us a new table."
4,Nice watch,"This watch looks beautiful and it is quiet and precise. Also, it is pretty thin and comfortable. It would be perfect if there were no two issues:1. It stopped working after two weeks. I suspected battery, so had a little trouble opening the watch.This is what you need to do: Find small opening between the lid and the body of the watch. Use very sharp knife or small flat screwdriver (that you can use to tighten sunglasses) and open. If you do not find this small hole, there is no way to open it. BTW, battery is hard to find in electronic or pharmacy stores. After I replaced it, it works just fine. The original battery was Sony, but it is possible that the watch was in a warehouse in the box for a year or two before it was shipped to me.2. Another concern is the knob on the side that is a little long and may rub the skin on your hand.I recommend this watch."
3,"Good Content, Poor Quality","I purchased this book in the last month. And in that time I have had numerous pages fall out. I have barely had a chance to use it, having opened no more than 40 times. I still have books from 1st & 2nd edition AD&D; that are in good condition--all pages are intact.Aside from the book binding problems, I really enjoy this campaign setting and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for setting to challange their players thinking and roleplaying skills. Attacking first and asking questions later becomes less of an option.I only have two wishes, other than fixing the binding. It would be nice if there was a downloadable PDF version similar to what Iron Crown does. And it would be nice if there was a player only version of the manual that contains only what players need to create characters. The Retail $50 price is very steep if each of your players are expected to purchase a copy. Oh, and did I mention the problem with the book binding."
3,"Useable, Decent.","It's not true leather, it's suede that is very stiff (maybe it will ""break in"" over time?), so I question how usable it will be for real construction type work. I got mine for a photoshoot, so overall, I am satisfied. I think the price is a bit high though, but it is a novelty (color), after all."
4,"Math, The Queen of Sciences","This book is best suited for readers with a good knowledge of the various fields of mathematics. It does not expound any technical details, but refers to mathematical results with which one should already be acquainted. The author himself was a mathematician who researched the history of mathematics. The result was the material in this book that contains the names of numerous mathematicians and scientists, and their publications with Latin, French, and German titles. Most of the foreign language titles and quotes have English translation in the footnotes."
3,A Concise History of Mathematics,"This is little more than a sketch of the history of mathematics. In broad strokes, it outlines the relationships among mathematicians and some of their texts, but says almost nothing of substance about the content of their work. Each chapter has a short bibliography, but since the last edition was in 1987 (1st ed. 1948), they are of limited value."
2,Good infromation - Bad english,"I bought the book for a class on history of math, and it covered that topic well. The issue I had was the usage of words only a PHD in English would use. The book lead me to the Internet to find more information about the period that was easier to understand."
3,The best introduction in _Math,"If you are searching some book about introduce you in the math World, you can find it in this book."
2,Simply a San Francisco-area goth/industrial band sampler,"While it does a fine job of showcasing the San Francisco-area gothic/industrial bands of its time, it does little to expose the listener to anything that might revitalize her/his interest in the genre. Instead, it serves only to justify their having written off [semi] contemporary gothic music in the first place.With few exceptions, it is a good example of why most of these bands have fallen by the wayside [and perhaps why it's time to move on]."
5,Do not confuse with the movie,Screwballs is too funny for words. But it is not the movie about endless [breasts].
3,"Bad symphony, excellent Carnival","The previous reviewer did not mention the performance of the Carnival of the Animals specifically. I agree with that person that the symphony performance is really terrible. However, the Carnival performance is quite splendid and for only 4 bucks, it is well worth it. For a great budget version of the symphony, try Martinon, a superior performance which also has the outrageous but entertaining Poulenc Organ Concerto plus two Saint-Saens tone poems."
4,A thrilling read,"From the minute I started reading this book, I felt like I couldn't read fast enough to keep up with the banter and dialogue between the two main characters. This style was very fast paced and engaging, and was the cause of a few late nights as I seemed to be unable to put the book down. Well-written with an interesting storyline, this book also has two superb main characters. These characters have different personalities and different agendas, however Josh Thomas has created them with such vividity that you care what happens to them."
4,A contemporary classic for the Hoosier State,"Murder at Willow Slough is to the Midwest and Indiana what ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" was to the South and Alabama. This is an important work of fiction that harkens attention to the civil rights struggles of our times. This is a tome that should be a recommended reading for everyone in Indiana; one of four states that has refused hereto to pass hate crimes legislation and mostly because of the homophobia of Hoosier leaders and alas citizens too. Hopefully this one will become another entry into the Library of Indiana Classics."
1,poorly written childish nonsense,"I have read an enormous number of gay and lesbian crime and detective novels and this is easily one of the worst. cardboard characters, naive and immature social and sexual notions masquerading as political commentary. Undoubtedly will appeal to the superficial... subculture that is obsessed with physical appearance and still intellectually and emotionally trapped in their high school years. I plowed through it mainly due to a fascination with how bad it could get."
4,for STAGE and SCREEN!,"This is an excellent book for the THEATRICAL costumer. It has scaled down patterns. Suggestions on how to design for and work with a production director or producer. Recommendations on how to ""fake"" a look for a period so that it will appear correct AND be easy to get in and out of. Notations on points to consider.... i.e.: is this a stage production where the garment will only be seen at a distance? is this a screen production where certain portions of a garment will be super sized on a movie screen?...those sort of scenarios are played out and hashed over. For the historian, interested in period accuracy, this will probably not be of any practical use. This does however give insight into how to get modern fabrics and trims to look convincing. For the intermediate or advanced seamstress. For the daring beginner who isn't afraid of a challenge."
3,Not as solid as its predecessor...,"This volume of Period Costume for Stage and Screen covers the Victorian and Edwardian eras, and the book is much less useful than the one that came out before it. While there are still a variety of patterns there is not nearly as much guidance on how to put them together, correct fabrics and looks, and similar detail. I have, however, used it in conjunction with my copy of Patterns of Fashion to iron out some of the more difficult concepts in that second book. Over all I still recommend it for a completionist's library, but would not recommend it to the beginning sewer at all."
4,Great book for the finishing,"This book is great if you have the basic know how. It shows you how to make an garment from start to finish, it even has plans on how to creat your own garments"
1,Disappointed,I ordered these hoping for the same comfort as the old terry cloth visors that I used to find just about anywhere years ago...after wearing for 30 minutes I started taking the visor off for a few minutes and putting it back on...I was way more disappointed than the vendor due to my search is still on for something comfortable to wear.
2,Slow Moving,"I am a fan of Fullerton's naval books. They are well written and reflect a comprehensive knowledge of ships and the sea, as well as naval warfare. This book, however, focuses on a ship of the maritime navy at the outset of the war, as it struggles to return home. The story is slow to unfold and the characters not nearly as well developed as those in other Fullerton novels. It's okay, but I can't recommend it along side his others."
3,Yes & No,Re: Nioxin Bliss; It works well. Pleasant smell. Just wish it was paraben free.. At least it is cruelty free.
4,Great guide book and easy to read,I bought this book for my nephew and was extremely impressed with the quality of detail about each of the 120 different species of dinosaurs.
4,Ballad of a Great Album,"Ian Hunter is the secret weapon for all aspiring songwriters, and vocalist. He may not be the best singer, but he gets his point across. These songs are pure magic. ""Psycho Girl,"" has a cool Buddy Holly meets punk vibe going on, and Invisable Strings is a song that Rod Stewart wishes he could still write. ""Red Letter Day,"" is another stand out. Nice and raw, and fun."
4,this does have some good songs,"Dancing on the moon, and never trust a blonde are really very good songs. This really isn't a bad effort, and deserves a listen. enjoy"
2,Where's Ian?,"I'm giving this one star because Ian Hunter is on it, and one star for The Other Man.I think it's a great song. I find the rest of the cd pretty ordinary. I think it's really kind of false advertising too. I don't want to hear some other guy singing when Ian Hunter's name on the cd. Maybe Ian just didn't have the songs. Anyway,it's just kind of a disappointing cd all around.I think it's the weakest I've heard from Ian."
1,Not as advertised,"Buyer beware! My husband measured the voltage of this before using it, and it was a good thing he did, because instead of 1.5V as advertised, it was actally 3.5V. So not only was the adapter useless, it would have fried our electronic that we bought it for."
5,Not being able to purchase an adapter for a cd player,"This is perfect, And can be used for many different types of electronics. Just what Iwas looking for. So pleased!"
3,Do not use this for Kindle Gen 1,"Since amazon doesn't carry the original Kindle Gen 1 charger adapter anymore I had to search for a suitable substitute. I was guided to this adapter...wrong choice. I set the back of the adapter to 4.5, as advised, and it charged my Kindle. After unplugging the charger I noticed that my Kindle was only half charged so I plugged it back in and it shorted out/burned out my Kindle. So although this product isn't defective it should not be used for Kindles. Be advised. I rated this product as average because it does work well if you use it appropriately."
1,"Underpowered, with a bad voltage regulator","I love these for powering various random, rarely used, or found electronics.Specs are:""3.0V - 12V OUTPUT 500MA MAX""Look around and you'll find 1000-1300mA units for less.Other reviewers have said the voltage setting is a notch higher that you'd expect.That's going to fry any of your sensitive devices.ALWAYS your device for power requirements.(No worry about a higher powered unit burning out your device- your device will only use the amperage that it needs, but take care in the voltage setting!)"
1,is this for real? i thought it was a car horn,wow. im sorry but this girl really does sound like a car horn. she needs to get a few years on her and improve her vocals. this is really bad. the downfall of pop.
1,Horrible CD,This CD is sick. Hilary's voice sucks. It's not even her own voice on the CD. Her voice is totally computerized. Don't buy this CD. You get different versions of the same sick song.
4,i love the song,i love the song its my 2ND fave the albamthe acoustic mix is better then the originalas FAR AS THE ALBAM GOES ITS MY SECOND FAV1ST FAVE IS..............................................METAMOPHOSIS
2,yeah right.,"You know, this would actually be a pretty song if it weren't for Hilary's god awful voice. Coming clean? Yeah right Hilary. Tons of effects couldn't save your voice and your still convinced you can sing? Take mine and everybody else's advice...STICK TO ACTING!!!"
2,"come on, guys!","the fact of the matter is that hilary duff can't sing. well, she obviously attempts to, the point is that it's NO GOOD. don't waste your money people."
4,Okay...,Okay...so her voice isn't really the best...not even close to Britney's (which is bad)...but this is still a really cool song and the mixes on this cd are great..
1,lol,"Ok first off...Hilary...write better music and learn to sing...no offense...ok ppl this is the only song of Hilary Duff that i actually kinda maybe sorta like. But whats with the lyrics any way? What the hell were you on?! The tune is ok, but the lyrics kill the whole song...then again i am used to rock music so...."
4,Extra interview,"I like the song Come Clean, but the only reason that I have to buy the single is because of the interview with Hilary. Does ANYONE know how long this interview is?? Cos if it's just half a minute, I not buing it."
3,"""Come Clean"" great! CD, not really","Hilary Duff is a great pop singer and Come Clean is one of her best songs! I love the beat and all the instruments used. It's my favorite song on her ""Metamorphosis"" album. That's why I was so happy to hear there was a remix CD. However, after receiving it, I was left disappointed. The first track sounds almost exactly like the original, the second track only adds the steady beat of a drum, and the third, the acoustic version, has no energy, and is very boring, almost annoying to listen to. The interview is something you'll probably only listen to once and the video you can watch on the internet. My verdict? Unless you want a CD filled with virtually 3 versions of ""Come Clean"" all sounding pretty much the same be my guest. If that's not your thing buy ""Metamorphosis"" which has tons of other cool songs by Hilary Duff on it and if you end up liking ""Come Clean"" as much as I do put it on repeat. Believe me, it'll sound just like this CD."
4,this IS pop people...,"Geeze. Cut the poor little girl some slack. Pop music isn't popular because everyone likes it...and why do people who hate things feel the need to go out of thier way to make sure everyone knows? because you're like 30 and have way too much time...It's not supposed to be deep, well sung, or expertly wrought. It's bubblegum. It's cute. It's despensible. Iknow it's manufactured. Like it or shut up.(...)"
4,Someting wrong!,"My disabled daughter loves Xena warrior princess and she has all four of them now. But on the fourth one,one of the disks was sracthand this was and new box we just got. Is there anything you as Amazoncan do about it? Thank You"
5,Tape,Nice. It is just what I wanted.It was very easy to order.And I would recommend it to others.I am very happy.
1,A big letdown...!!,"I'd have to guess that most of the reviews about this product, especially the super long ones, are plants. Because I loved season one through three, but this season...season four...is just a major bore! A real snoozer! What the heck happened? Was it true like a friend of mine said, they got writers from the failed Hercules series and they brought this one down too? I've have this package, season four for over two and a half years, and haved tried to watch the episodes a bunch of times...but a real bore. !! Not even interested in season five or six if this is how the series turned out."
3,Somewhat Disappointed,"I enjoy having Season 4 on DVD because I love the episodes. However, I am none too thrilled with the additional features. It seems that the commentary from Lucy Lawless and Renee O'Connor is sloppy. It's as if it were just thrown together without much thought. There is lots of commentary from the writers and directors, but I much rather hear from the actors, also way too much Rob Tappert.In my opinion, Season 4 marked a point where the subtext really reached a new level, and there is little to no discussion about it on this set--it was discussed more in depthly on the other series of DVDs.It's worth the $$ for the episode, but your out of luck if you LOVE subtext discussions"
5,OMG!,Just one word T Money. Your will just have to get the season to find out.This alone is worth the $ to buy this. YO YO T MONEY.
5,Another Great 22 episodes!,I love season 4 of Xena!! This is their best work!! The acting is great and the stories rock! I love to be able to watch this show over and over again! Thank goodness for DVD! The extras are also a lot of fun...I love knowing what the actors thought of their work. I'd highly recommend this set to everyone who enjoys great TV!!
5,Fantastic series to own,I started watching this series from it's very first episode to it's last and never tired of seeing Xena and her sidekick Gabrielle go from place to place helping the needy and sick!
5,xena is the best !!,"Xena is one of the best television sreies that touched soo many hearts of fans. Xena season four is one of the best seasons that she had ever done.It has what every action show would have, drama , love , desire and mystery.If your a xena fan ,then go get this DVD set."
5,"The correct title of the song on Track 11 is ""Holy Moly"", not ""Holy Holy"".","The title of the song on Track 11 is not ""Holy Holy"". The correct title of the song on Track 11 is ""Holy Moly"", which is an OUTSTANDING song."
4,Good storage,I like these. I would recommend more cushy pieces (foam) to place inbetween for seperating the plates but overall I like the product and the price.
3,"Not great quality, but they serve the stated purpose","This set does the job, but it is not high quality china storage. If you only need your china covered, these will work. If you want dishes better protected, you may want to spend a little more money. The foam inserts are very cheap. I would recommend buying different dish separators."
4,6 Piece china protectors,My set of china protectors arrived today. They work for the purpose intended. I have an old set of Fire King with the gold rims. My grandmother got the set piece by piece back in the 60's at the grocery store. We are getting rid of a china cabinet and I had to store these until I bought a new cabinet. They serve the purpose. I did add extra padding even though Fire King dinnerware is slightly on the heavy side.
3,"too much midbass emphasis, bloated midrange, unrefined highs",These speakers sound very boxed in and 2 dimensional. They have too much emphasis on mid bass to give illusion of low end bass which these speakers do not have. The midrange sounds bloated and the highs lack refinement. Much better speakers for the money are the Pinnacle Classic Gold Aerogels or Monitor Audio Silver 5's for even cheaper.
4,MK and A use their (identical) heads!!!,"It's hard to believe that finding an elephant is hard, but Mary-Kate and Ashley have a tough time. But it all turns out....""The circus must go on."""
2,Boring stuff,Some of my Mary-Kate and Ashley is great stuff...but some-awfully boring! The New Adventures of Mary-Kate & Ashley are practically unreadable.
4,"a camera .,Friends ,and 20 bucks","Duel on Planet ZThe film is on smash cuts super sci-fi and I wish it was at the beginning of the compilation. The film reminds me of one of those old on going movie teaser. ( superman,or the racketeer) Sure its cheese, but its a well done copy of the the 1950's style of sci fi film making, It's only 3 min but spoofs so much .obvious wires, space orbs( tinfoil balls) Lasers, mind altering unexplainable sci fi powers, capt kirk fighting , and when its all over the scene capping scream to the sky (...)Plus if you see this movie you must watch you director interview towards the end of smash cuts compilation. The interview is just as fun to watch as the short its self."
5,This Band Rules,I saw these guys open with Lifetime for Good Riddance and they blew Good Riddance away. They reminded me of Monsula live... it was a great show and this is a great album. Get it if you like punk rock.
5,Excellent acoustic pop,Very well done CD! In the vain of Joshua Radin's Simple Times or Christian Floyd's Dreams Into Daylight. Highly recommended!
3,"A good effort to use Minkus & Scott numbers, needs editing",I thought having a book that had a cross reference of Minkus and Scott stamp catalog numbers would be great. After using the Krause-Minkus Standard I have my doubts that this catalog is all that useful. I had problems with several sections of stamps not being listed and many listed incorrectly. Several stamp pictures were swapped around and several have the same Scott catalog numbers even when the denominations were different. As I said it was a good attempt at combining the two different publications into a single catalog but I feel that more time should have been taken to edit and proof the work prior to publishing. I think that if Krause-Minkus were to provide a credit to those that had purchased the 1998 edition it will keep some collects using the Krause numbers. I for one would ask for a refund or a replacement 1999 catalog.
5,cheaper than ultimate pleasure pack,why buy LSL pleasure pack when you can buy this great game for half the price and purchase love for sail and casino very cheap
1,Disappointed,"Very disappointed in this product. Bought this for my 19 month old grandson, thinking it was much bigger that it is. Only about 3 x 5 inches in size....pictures not large enough to color and book wouldn't stay open for him to color."
1,To small for children,"Way to small for children. Not worth the paper it is made of. Strongly feel this is a scam product. ,"
1,Tiny worthless,"Either I totally missed the product description or the one I ordered didn't have one. This product is about two inches wide and 3 tall... not at all what I expected for a coloring book. By the time my two year old scribbles for two seconds the page is filled, ripped in half and she irritated."
3,Tiny book,"The Little ABC Coloring Book (Dover Little Activity Books)I initially thought the book had accidentally been left out of my order, then saw it at the bottom of the box. Had I noticed the dimensions, I would not have bought it, however, the pictures re cute."
2,SMALL!,"I didn't realize just how small this was, if i had know I wouldn't have ordered it.I also ordered the dinosaur ABC book was the same size! I thought it was a joke!"
1,The size is the size of my checkbook! Way to small!,This is the size of my checkbook- literally! I am very disappointed in this book as well as the little animal abc book. I thought I was getting full size books as I ordered it in a three pack (The ABC bookk by Anna Pomaska came full size and was 2.50). Be CAREFUL if you choose 1.50 with a 2.50 book. Do not purchase as a small child can not even open the pages and color inside of it. This was a waste of money!
3,You get what you pay for,"Pay close attention to the dimensions of the book; this book is tiny. I enlarged it on the copier by quite a bit to create a usable-size (i.e., 8-1/2""x11"") worksheet for my young students. Pre-schoolers may have a hard time coloring the small pages, so I recommend that you enlarge them, too. Otherwise, I agree with the other reviewer that it would make a nice party favor if it's not going to be used for other purposes, like in a classroom to supplement an alphabet lesson."
3,"B is for bird, C is for clown",On the left-hand page is a capital letter. On the right-hand page is a picture of an item with a name starting with that letter.My only grievance is the binding on the book. I have had to mend several pages which came loose.(...)
3,"should of read reviews before purchasing, opps","sometimes we just don't pay attention to the details. it is little, too small for a pre-schooler. But on the other hand it was only $1.35."
3,"OK, not great","I bought this album last year to test my new 7.1 channel high-end system. I have an Oppo player with full HDMI connections and the sound was good, but no better than many blu-rays, some CD's and some vinyl. The acoustics of the recording hall seemed inadequate. The performances are, in my opinion, uninspired. Rather than this, consider the blu-ray of the 2012 Vienna Philharmonic concert. The sound is better, the ballet sequences are beautiful, and the extra feature is a hoot!"
1,shadow dragon,This movie is alot like a home movie. There is alot of cursing for no real reason except the lack of any real script. It is not a movie that most people will even make it thru to the end. Keep these few hours for something worth while.
2,Delta DP350R (Reconditioned),"I do understand the slow boat delivery because it was the free shipping. Next time I will option for the paid delivery. The drill press arrived with some damage to the light shade. - Crushed when the drill press shifted during shipping. When installed on the bench, there was noise and rubbing inside the upper pulley housing area. Upon opening the inspection plate, I found the drive pulley, tension spring and pressure washer were floating on the motor shaft. the retaining clip was missing and could not be found inside the machine or packing. I called the number provided from Delta and they were very conserned and helpful and they would send out the clip and a new light and even a new rear pulley. They haven't shown up yet."
2,really not what i expected,"Very disappointed in these flats. The sole is really thick so it's not that cute to wear with jeans or anything. I got them in the gold color and it is VERY GOLD. I mean it's screaming flashback gold ! Not for me, going back to amazon!"
1,Painful shoes,I can't wear them more than 10 minutes without ending up with blisters. These shoes are so stiff it's not even funny. Thank God I bought them when they were on sale.
2,Not what I expected,It wasn't what I imagined. It looks very cheap and worned out. I don't like the wide feeling cuz it doesn't make your feet look elegant. It makes your feet looks sloppy. but then again what do you expect for 25 bucks. I guess I'll wear it to take out the garbage.
3,Great for Classes,"This book has been great for practicing Hungarian. It covers grammar, vocabulary, and practical situations. But beware--there is no English to go along with the Hungarian, so it would not be practical for someone trying to learn the language on their own."
1,1 star for looks........,"These boots were pretty to look at, but a bear to wear! I couldn't get them over the arch of my foot, and I have a small foot! I pulled so hard, that the boot strap broke. I received them as a gift from Nordstrom, and the saleperson said that a lot of other women had the same problem."
5,Beautiful Boot!,These boots were just beautiful! I bought them as a Christmas gift for my mother and they were a hit. They were well made and very stylish. They do fit a bit narrow though - so they're in the shop being stretched. I would buy Penny Loves Kenny boots again.
3,Does the job...,"What can you really say about a glittery 4-finger pimp costume ring that says ""Big Daddy""? It works well as a Pimp costume accessory. However, it took some time to bend open the small rings just to make them fit onto my regular-sized men's fingers. Only a child or small lady could have gotten the ring on otherwise. Looks good, but the glitter came off a little bit in some places as I struggled to make the ring fit."
1,It immediately fell apart upon opening package,"I took it out of the package and 3 of the 4 rings fell off. So, that was disappointing. Wenever got to use it. It looked fun in the package"
1,Crap,This ring cannot be worn - it is only for show. It is plastic and the finger holders will break as soon as you attempt to slide this ring on.
2,Didn't get the watch to review...,"I ordered this product before Christmas this year, it looks like a really great product, standard 3-5 business day shipping. I got a ""confirmation"" the day I ordered it saying it had shipped, but no tracking information was available. It was expected to be here a week ago and never arrived. I contacted amazon, then the company I purchased from (watchgems) who claim that fedex ""lost it."" Something tells me they just never sent it out... They replied to my email almost instantly saying fedex lost it, how did they get ahold of fedex so quickly and find out that they lost it that quickly? I would at lease expect SOME SORT of an ""investigation"" of where it went... That's why I think they never even bothered to send it. I did get a full refund, which was processed very quickly & it was nice to hear back from the company so promptly, but I really would have liked to receive the product I ordered. Oh well, hopefully better luck for you all."
4,Good buy for the price,"This mic is a very good buy for its price. It is lightweight to handle, but has excellent frequency response.Have been using it for a month and have no complaints!"
3,Not bad,"It's a microphone. Nothing special, it serves its purpose, the quality is okay. It all depends why you need a microphone."
3,Good but not excellent,"The frequency response is not as good as advertised. But what you pay is what you get. For a microphone with this price, don't expect too much."
4,Decent for the Price,"Add a pop filter, and you've got a decent microphone. Definitely no Blue Snowball, or Blue Yeti, or whatever, but it gets the job done."
3,Good begginer mic,"I am lead VOX for our new band and needed a decent priced mic. So far this will work for practices, it has decent range, but is prone to feedback. Its a great beginner mic!"
5,Excellent microphone at a great price,"I'm very pleased with this microphone. The volume level is good. As advertised, it only picks up sound from the direction it's pointing (which is good for avoiding feedback and environmental noise). It's a quality microphone at a reasonable price."
3,Ok,"Easy to use, just plug and play. However, a small constant buzz in the background of all recordings. Not terrible for 10 bucks and through a PC sound card."
2,get what you pay for,"Well you get what you pay for with this item. I had a gift card so it was kindof a waste. I mean It works its just really low sound, and not the best quality. I have a computer mic that does much better. So I read the reviews and thought it may not be the best but I tried. definetly need to pay more than 18 bucks for a mic. 30 to 40 will be the better kinds."
2,Don't like the sound,The microphone seems to be lacking in base...the sound is not as good as my samsung Mic.
2,Overall sound quality inadequate,"I may have assumed I was getting more than I paid for, but the dynamic range on this mike make good for little more than child's play."
1,what a poor mic,"I guess you have to expect for the price it won't be spectacular, but it was just plain bad. Didn't install without a lot of conf changes and even then, the sound was bad. Don't waste you time or money, just move on..."
4,A decent mic,"I originally bought this mic for the singular purpose of recording the guitars for my band. Its use is simple, just plug it into the microphone jack on your computer and you're ready to start recording. Granted, it is not studio quality recording, but it does its job well, especially considering the price. I would have given it 4 1/2 stars if I could. A good beginner's mic for vox, guitars, drums, whatever you wish to record with it."
2,Nothing new here,"Lackluster coming of age film tells the all-too-familiar story of two gay teenagers who escape from their repressive hometown and journey to the big city in search of happiness and freedom, only to discover that the bright lights mask the dark and sinister reality of life on the streets.The best thing about the film is the photography. The grainy black-and-white effectively highlights the dreary, bleak nature of these characters' lives. But the acting isn't so hot, and neither is the script. One can and should give indies a little leeway when it comes to rough production values, but a small budget is no excuse for bad acting, and certainly not for bad writing, both of which are found in this film.""The Toilers and the Wayfarers"" isn't a terrible movie by any means. But it isn't a very good one either."
3,Jordan's cool review of calling me home,"The begining of this book was kind of boring, it talked about how Abbie didnt wont to live on the prairie she wonted to move back to town in st. joesph. she had two brothers and one sister they lived in a sody on the prairie her dad worked in town and the family didnt see him for weeks then one day he came home for a week then her brother nathaniel got very sick so abbie had to take her dad back in to town on the way back her sister sarah told her to go back in to town and get a doctor because both of her brothers were very sick when the doctor came he said that her little brother charlies was going to die then the family was very sad."
2,Could have been much better.,"""Calling Me Home"" is interesting in a historical point of view, but other than that, it is a boring book. Unlike many other Oregon Trail inspired books, this story deals with the process in buying land and living in a soddy. This book was very redundant and lacked character development. Topics were mentioned, but then dropped: example Abbie's piano, their old house, family members stricken with cholera, By's family, etc. If these potential story lines had been expounded on, the book would have been much better. I do not recommend."
2,Head crash on the 2nd year,"I purchased this external drive from Amazon on mid-October 2008. The drive worked admirably smooth until a few days ago when it began to make grunting noises and finally the click of death happened. I never expected an Iomage product to turn against me in this way. While this drive works nicely even with the slightly audible motor and slow wake-up times, it proved to be unreliable as a solitary unit in the end. Now my data is in jeopardy. Don't consider making this drive your only backup option!Dr. Oz.Istanbul"
2,LOUD.,It's got space and lots of ports but I can hear it in my bedroom from my office two doors away. It's just way too loud.
3,Good hard drive. Works great with MacMini.,"I've been using it for more than 2 years and it is flawless until Today.The only downside of this hard drive is that it does not turn on/off automatically by USB (so it could be waken up by the macmini) and the on/off button is in the back of the unit.In my opinion, this is a downside of the macmini as well. On/off button should be in the front of the unit."
2,Fails to mount,"I've had this drive for five months and it has worked fine, but now it frequently will not mount on the desktop. I will be looking to return it to Iomega. I run regular backups and my data is too important to tolerate flaky hardware like this."
2,Does not last long,"It fits great with my Mac Mini, but it seemed to be a lemon from the start. It would often power off and not power back on for days. When it would stay on, there would be connectivity issues and no computer was able to connect to it using USB or Firewire.I had to return it to the manufacturer which took a couple weeks (Iomega lost track of it...). It worked fine once I got it back from Iomega but a couple months after its warranty expired, it no longer could power up and became a brick.Overall I'm not terribly impressed with Iomega for its support and reliability."
3,service? not here!!!!! forget the idea when you buy iomega.,"while the product may or may not function well, the word service is not in the iomega vocabulary. not only is their website one of the most poorly designed that i have ever encountered, the idea of a $25 fee for telephone support on an IN warranty item is piggy (out of warranty is not serviced at all), and the online chat service is staffed with people who do not have a clue, and the information they give is not alway accurate! instructions are incomplete and poorly written. customer support (by email or online chat, unless you want to spend $25 to speak to someone. this is very unusual for a new product) is vague and often incorrct. there is no cd included anymore, although you are referred to 'instructions on enclosed cd.' you will have to figure out for yourself how to use this product. find a product that offers better service."
3,Disappointed,Just received my new Minimax from Amazon and I'm a little disappointed. The install disk is missing from the box (luckily I'm using this with a Mac Mini so don't need it) and also the Minimax itself is scuffed on top (there was no protective plastic cover) and has small chips missing from the aluminium edge. If I was a sceptic I'd say this was a used drive I've been sent. I'm happy to have used/refurb'd hardware but not when I'm paying the $$$$ for new!Other than the above the unit complements the Mac Mini very well and works with it straight out of the box. Only time will tell if the performace remains good. For my next HD purchase I'll be going with another make.
2,Often doesn't mount,"Half the time this drive will not mount over USB or Firewire. You have to turn it off, then turn it back on again. Repeat a couple of times and you may get lucky."
4,Surprisingly solid bass and reliability,"Bought to up-grade 15's in an inexpensive TP subwoofer. Driven with a Behringer EP 2500 bridged at 4 ohms for claimed 1200 watts each driver. One driver shipped with cone edge reinforcement ring peeling apart...so not confident about these. Emailed Eminence but never heard back. (Strike 2) Glued them and have had no problems. Drivers sound clean and solid even in marginally sized cabinet. Have been driven hard in 90+ degree heat for 12+ hours with no failures. I Feel like these are an exceptional value in the 600 watt range. Reviewers who seem knowledgable have said they sound ""better"" than the Kappa Pro's....and I could believe that. I would buy them again."
5,Awesome material!,"This collection brings the 100th episode B-roll footage, never-before-seen-footage, interviews, audio/ video commentaries and more. In this season life changing occurances happen. Very surprising episodes! A musical episode, new characters and lots more of awesome episodes. Add this one to your DVD collections!"
4,Good purchase But,this was to complete the Set of all the Xena Show.. can in quickly.. was a gift for my wife.. season 5 brings all the loose ends together. Unfortunately disc#2 was bad for episodes 2 and 3. show stoppers for the season.. clean the disk and repaired to the point were we could hear the audio with some video shots.. only offered was a return or 15.00 credit..
4,Grandson really likes it,"I bought it for my grandson who is 21. He likes it quite well. I like the 'mellow' sound, but the repetition is rather boring for me. I am not one to listen to music much when I am working on the computer. The CD is no doubt good for that kind of thing. It may be good to drive by (not drive-by shooting) I haven't tried that (either one)."
3,Not kinetic,"This hazy mixture of ambient and post-rock does work, though it hardly breaks any ground, and with an epic running time can become long-winded."
3,A little less reverb...,"Cranking up the reverb until everything you do on the guitar sounds like you are drifting weightlessly in space goes back to Steve Roach's ambient excursions. It's is a great tool that can be very effective when used sparsely. Hammock has decided that they can make entire albums with this trick. Here's the rub: so can anyone else. A little of this goes a long way. Many of the tracks sound almost alike. Once you get over the novelty of the shoegazing, cavernous, outer space sounds, you listen desperately for some creative and original use of those sounds. I couldn't find them. Gets tedious quickly."
5,Beautifully Ethereal and Emotional,"Fans of Sigur Ros, Mogwai, and Explosions in The Sky: This is a must!! Never before have I heard such beautiful music. Words alone cannot describe the emotions this music provokes."
4,cute illustrations,"Small in size, easy to tuck in a pocket or bag on the go. Illustrations very cute, text is short on each page. Scratch and sniff stickers are small, punch and apple stickers had the most smell. Popcorn, doughnuts, and candy corn are less noticable. Still a very good book for a book lover!"
2,Failed in Comparison,"Although a big Catherine Coulter fan, I found this book quite disappointing. The plot did not stick together very well with a poor climax and cluttered ending. I've always seen this book laying around on bookshelves and now I know why.I enjoyed the heroines (Miranda, Entti, and Sira) but the heroes were trivial."
2,WHAT DID I EVER SEE IN HER?,"I used to like Catherine's books a long time ago. That was before I met Woodiwiss, Lindsey(of old), Garwood, and McNaught. I recently read this book and wondered what I ever saw in her writing. The female has a very fluent air in her speech while her men talk as if they just learned a new language. It is stunted reading in the dialogue. This particular story had great potential, but it went sour after the third or fourth chapter. I don't know of any reader who enjoys the heroine being forced time after time to have intimacies, and be expected to forgive the hero, if he can be called that. The writing is a 1, but the story line that had potential is a 2. It wasn't until recently that I realized that Coulter uses a lot of violence to get her heroines under control of the male or rather to show the males dominance. Unsatisfying and bitter."
1,hated it!!!,"UGH!! i did not like this book at all!! i couldnt even finish it because i got so fed up with the 'hero' he was abusive, rude and i dont know how anyone could love him!! i was ready to throw this book out the window!! women were treated so badly in this book!! and there were very weird parts in this book. this was the first book i have read by this author and i dont plan to read any of her books again!!dont waste your money on this book!!!"
3,Strong Heroine character,"The main savoir of this book is the heroine. She is strong, independent and very smart. You'll be rooting for her all the way. In terms of romance, I think it's lacking a bit...I do see the chemistry between hero and heroine, but NOT enough time given to romance development so the love seem a little bit forced. Bonus are some of the supporting characters. Those of you who don't enjoy alternative sexual content and possible incest should keep away from this book."
3,Easy to read but left me feeling bored.,"Not only was this my first Catherine Coulter novel, but it was my first book in the Historical Romance genre. The story kept my interest enough to finish the book but by the time I had gotten to the last 1/4 of the book, I was READY to be done with it. If you're looking for quick page turner, then this is a good choice. Or, if you're looking for something to do to pass the hours, this will definitely do it! But with so many good books out there to choose from, I'm wondering why I chose this one. Oh yeah, it was the Viking thing. I love vikings and it was interesting to see how she used words that were unique to what you'd think would be the way vikings would speak, but it wasn't enough. I don't feel like I got a ""viking feel"" as much as I'd hoped I would. Not sure if my expectations were too high or what...but this book left me feeling bored."
1,Falls a mile short of interesting!,"I love romances, once I get them I usually can't put them down. This is the first book I've read from Ms.Coulter and it's my last. Rorik was an unsympathetic abuser who was found humiliating Mirana constantly throughout the book. Mirana was uninteresting. Their romance was practically nonexistent and they went from hating each other to loving each other in one chapter! Don't waste your time on this one!"
1,dumb,"This has to go down as the most boring, dumb, and lame book Ihave ever read. Rorik is a wife beater, and Mirana, as strong as sheis, just takes it, then somehow manages to fall in love with him.In general, I never know what to expect with Coulter's books. Sometimes they're superb, other times, they're like this one: you have to force yourself to finish the book."
1,Frustrating,"I agree with the other reviewer. Errors, errors, errors! Find a different review book if possible."
2,DISAPPOINTED,"My hula dancer arrived broken. She was missing the little spring that made her shake. Since I had a mere 48 hours to put her on a birthday cake, I couldn't return. I had to pull out my hot-glue & put her together. Very cute item, but obviously it's poorly constructed."
5,No complaints,"An external HD with Firewire 400 and USB 2.0 interfaces. Works without a power brick in either case, and the metal case and finish are exquisite. Internally uses a PATA drive, if you care. No problems."
5,BEBE and CECE Ultimate Collection,The Ultimate CollectionThe songs on this CD is fantastic and I would recommend this CD for all the fans of BEBE and CECE Winans.
3,"Seen ""The Apartment""? Then You've Seen ""Loser.""","The plot of the movie starring Jack Lemmon and Shirley Maclaine, and the plot of the movie starring Jason Biggs and Mena Suvari are one and the same. Hapless loser (Lemmon, Biggs) gets picked on by the guys at work/roommates in college, while carrying a torch for pretty girl (Maclaine, Suvari) who's enmeshed in an affair with boss/college professor (Greg Kinnear in LOSER). When girl nearly overdoses, loser comes to rescue.Not that it's a bad movie; there are worse things that could be remade. And Suvari's hot; too bad she'd married. But it's a shame more people in Hollywood can't be original."
3,3 1/2 STARS...FOR A CHARMING MOVIE,"I have been reading the reviews here, and I guess this movie was not received very well. I thought it was a cute, charming, comedy with romance thrown in. The film stars Jason Biggs as Paul, fresh from American Pie, and Mena Suvari as Dora, who was covered in rose petals in American Beauty. They are being portrayed as the ""Losers"" of the film, but after watching the roommates who tortured Paul for not being like them and for having a girl pay attention to him without help from a PILL slipped into her drink, we all find out who the real losers are.Greg Kinnear plays the professor that Dora is having an affair with, just so she can have a residence. He doesn't end up being a very good guy in this film, which is what I was used to seeing him as, but he does a good job in his role.While this isn't one of the best movies of the year, it had some charm to it and I recommend it for a romantic comedy rental..A good date movie."
3,CUTE CUTE CUTE!,"Well this movie isn't a masterpiece, but it does make for a good laugh. Personally, I like the undertones the movie touches on that COULD be made into a whole other movie. I mean... young college student+good-looking lit. professor? Good stuff..def. movie material. The kitten litter makes this movie extra cute... it reminded me of when I was dissecting a cat for biology and found fetal cats complete w/ the chorion, amnion, and placenta. It was kind of awkward seeing it in a movie however.A question though... was the featured college def. NYU?? It fits the context and is $35K a year. Could the movie be mocking NYU for it's hefty price tag? I think so. (They didn't give me a scholarship! argh!) Well enjoy the movie... I would def. watch it again."
4,"Not a classic, but very cute//","Okay so its not a classic ingenious story, and its not break out funny like american pie, but i thought the movie was cute. Jason Biggs plays Paul, a kid who just left a small town to go to college to find the big city full of inpersonal uncaring people. Paul is a big clutz and a loser, but he is such a sweetie. Jason biggs does a good job playing a loser. Mena Suvari i really liked as the character of Dora. She's nice and knows how to have fun without spending 30$. There is a good chemistry between Biggs and Suvari more likely due to the fact they worked toghether before. Greig Kinnear plays the unlikable boyfriend professor. The story is somewhat funny, but it's mostly a romance film. Almost no romance films have too much creativity but for being a teen movie this one does a pretty good job. by the end you will be saying ""awww, wasn't that cute"". I thought the movie did a decent job of not being the typical teenage love story. All and all a pretty good movie."
3,Neither outrageously funny nor outrageously stupid,"Most people describe Loser as either ""cute"" or ""light"". These are pretty accurate descriptions of this romantic comedy movie.Jason Biggs plays a small town boy moving into the ""big city"", New York, to go to university. His boorish roomates do not appreciate his dedication to his school work and soon ostracize him. As things begin to look bleak, Biggs meets Meena Suvari, a cute coed love interest that just happens to be dating Biggs' self centered, pompous english teacher (Gregg Kinear).Predictable but amusing, it manages to be funny without excess profanity of nudity. It is a safe bet to watch with your girlfriend."
3,Good movie if your expectations are correct.,"I had expected to find a movie somewhat similar to American Pie -or one that at least had a little more humor in it. This was by far a love story and although there were occasional funny moments, it was not a comedy. However, I thought the movie itself was good, and the storyline was fine - - it was just my expectation that was wrong. If you want a comedy - - go get Love Stinks or Clerks."
2,Uh...Don't bother,"Ok, I actually first saw this movie with my friend at the theather because I got free passes for a screening. I saw it thinking it was pretty decent and got on with my life. Later when I actually thought about it I found a ton of reasons to dislike the movie. One that really annoyed me was Mena Suvari's role. I happen to like her but her role totally bashed women. She dressed kinda wacky and different which I totally thought was cool, but she let her teacher/boyfriend treat her like garbage. Also Jason Biggs; what's up with him? I don't even need to go into further detail. I usually like teeny movies but this about the worst one I've seen. Through out this trash and rent a great movie...."
2,Just not good,"You'd think with Amy Hickerling as director and Mena Suvari and Jason Biggs, this movie should have been great, but instead it was a huge disappointment. I had a hard time buying Jason Biggs as a small time guy starting school, and his roommates were just mean, instead of being funny cariactures like those in Heckerling's Clueless. The brightest spot was Mena Suvari, who was the only person who felt 3 dimensional. For her, I'll give it 2 stars instead of 1.' Skip this movie and see American Pie again."
2,"Brave, scathing, searingly honest.","'Loser' is Amy Heckerling's 'Candide', in which a naive optimist is sent out into the world, only to discover that it is unjust, exploitative and brutal. The best thing about 'Loser' is its casting, and the manipulation of expectations it raises: where 'American Pie' was a sweet romantic comedy disguised as a scatalogical exposure of man's basest instincts, 'Loser' is a scatalogical exposure of man's basest instincts disguised as a sweet romantic comedy. The ironic references to Mena Suvari's most iconic role - 'American Beauty' - expose the paedophilia driving that work's sentimentality.This is a film of unimpeachable integrity, as ugly and unpleasant as the characters it satirises, 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' in Hell. So much integrity, in fact, it's vitually unwatchable."
4,loer,loser was a really cute movie. i loved how in the end he gets the girl. it is really funny too.
1,The title says it all!,"I rented this movie on DVD hoping it will be good but it wasn't. It had a bad plot and horrible acting. I am a Jason Biggs fan and of course the hot actress Mena Suvari but I didn't find this movie funny. It seemed more like a serious movie and a romance movie. It's about a dorky kid who moves into a big city where he finds out that nobody likes him. He moves in with 2 roommates who are really mean to him. He suddenly falls in love with his professor's girlfriend but the kid doesn't know they are in love. Later, the girl falls in love with him back and the kid starts to be cool. See what I mean? I didn't really like this movie at all it was really boring. The only thing good about this movie is Mena Suvari. If you really want to see this movie I would rent this as a date movie or if you want to see a hilarious movie go rent American Pie or Road Trip."
1,very slow- a waste of time,"I too was expecting a fun and cute movie- though not necessarily of the American Pie genre- and found an extremely SLOW and boring moving. I hated the roommates, why were they even in the movie? I found myself just praying the movie would end soon whether they got together or not- I didn't care, just end the movie! There are better ways to waste 2 hours, don't bother with this one."
1,Disappointing,I took a date to see this movie and we ended up staring at each other saying....what the? For a date movie this was a wierd one. Biggs plays a dweeb again but this time doesn't have his support system around him like he did in American Pie. Instead he has 2 freaky roommates who border on criminals (they use date rape drugs?) and nobody to help him out.The professor and college student romance is equally creepy. The whole movie is so dysfunctional that I cringed so often my back hurt. There is zero chemistry between biggs and suvari. Its more like she pitied him more than anything else.
5,Loser DVD,"Terrific movie! This movie is old and out of circulation, but Amazon had it in stock and at at a great price."
1,Don't Bother,"If you can access Amazon, this book is too basic for you. If you have ever used any windowing computer that ever was, you won't find anything of value in the 1070 pages. The author tells you that XP was designed to communicate over networks, but doesn't explain how to communicate to a machine running windows 98 (which XP doesn't like to do at all), nor does he explain how to burn a CD with Microsoft's seamlessly integrated (and useless) CD software. There is a paragraph on the concept of a zoom button, but none on making your digital camera download pictures.Since the pages are to small to be used in the fireplace and too stiff to use in the bathroom, I have no use whatever for this book."
3,Windows XP: The Complete Reference,"This book focuses more on the Home Edition and does not provide the detail needed to call itself a complete reference. It does provide about 99% of what you'll use, but not the detail I was looking for. This is why I gave it 3 stars. Not a bad book for most, but not a reference."
2,Windows For Absolute Beginners...,"... at least that is what the book should be called. This book does not deserve to be called a ""complete reference"". It seems to have been written for people who have never used a computer before, and have no idea what Windows is. As an IT person I had hoped for something with substance, but it was not to be found in this book. Much of the information is misleading because of ambiguous phrasing, or just plain wrong. If you need solid, detailed information about XP, then look elsewhere."
5,Anxiously awaiting Realworld.com !!!,"I loved this book !!! Don't be fooled by its small size..it's filled with real life in all its pain, mystery, pathos and laughter. If the excerpt of Realworl.com is but a tease, bring it on, Steve !!!! I will try to wait patiently for the full text..."
4,Not as good as Samurai Showdown IMO,I got this game as well as Samurai Showdown 2 pretty close together. I had fun with this game and it was great fun but I wasn't hooked even with all the different modes of play. This is probably more critical because I am comparing it to SS2 but this is just my humble opinion. Now if I feel like playing a fighting game I would choose SS2 over this.
4,metal slug the first mission,"It was A cool shooter but, it can be pretty hard. I think I got my money's worth."
2,Traits High on a Cloud,"By far, the best song on the album is High on a Cloud by the Traits. It's a classic garage band hit, from a great era in time."
5,"Love this show, Zooey makes it!","This show is about an innocent, sweet teacher searching for love while living with three funny men! <3 so funny!"
5,New Girl,I have watched all episodes so far of this new show and really enjoy it. I look forward to each new episode and hope there will be lots of new seasons to follow this one.
5,Very funny!,It was very funny and entertaining. I enjoyed watching this and laughed out loud. I definitely do recommend watching this.
5,Addict,Being a New Girl series addict. I love having the first season on dvd to watch anytime the feeling happens.
4,A closet fan of this show,"My wife is a huge fan and she has gotten me hooked onto this show. At first, I thought that it was stupid, but it grew on me. Gotta love Schmitt!"
3,New Girl is Funny...in a predictable way,"This show is great for exactly the reason I purchased it- something to kind of laugh at while I have an hour or two before bed. It's overdone, and it's obvious that the writers went out of their way to try to get a ""nerdy"" character. It is what it is....a bland drama- how I met your mother, only, not."
5,Another New Girl Winner,"Hilarious episode delving into the boy and girl roommate problem areas. Of course it would not be as good without Jess and Schmidt. Watch it, you won't regret it."
2,Boring typical sitcom,"I watched this show because a friend recommended it to me. It's a very typical soap-sitcom about dating and relationships. So if you like this, go ahead and watch it. Otherwise, stay away."
5,"""Who's that girl? It's Jess!""","New Girl starring the adorable Zooey Deschanel is the perfect show! There hasn't been many funny comedies in the last 5, maybe even 10 years but I fell head-over-heels in love with this show over a year ago. This show is well-written and well-acted. The storylines are fresh and I think my favorite episode from Season 1 is ""The Story of 50"". I was never really taken with Zooey as a movie actress until I started watching New Girl. Zooey is more engaging as a t.v. actress because she gets to let loose more and her character, Jess is an oddball with a heart of gold! I highly recommend it, enjoy!"
2,New Girl Is Too Jewish,"Zooey Deschanel is a real talent and the ""awkward schtick"" that she does in this series is funny. A show built around her would definitely have promise, but this falls way short. The writing is flaccid and the comedy is often too broad. And the co-stars are nowhere near as talented as she and it ruins what could have been a great vehicle. But that's what happens when you choose a cast based on who's Jewish rather than who's the most talented. I'm referring here to actor Jake Johnson (Jewish despite the Anglo name) and then most especially Max Greenfield who is not only awful and a total amateur, but is so homely it's genuinely painful to look at his face."
2,hated it....,"Not at all interested in this sitcom.....just seems like it will not last long. Poor writing, acting, etc... I liked her in Elf but seems like she is cast in the wrong character role here. Just my opinion."
1,Zoey De whatever her name is sucks,"I hate this Zooey DeChannel. I refuse to spell or pronounce her name correctly, I am not French. She is sooooooooooooooo quirky and different, which apparently makes her cool. In reality, she is a nerd, and she is not pretty at all, I mean i'd probably still do her, but only from behind. Her act is tired, she plays the same character in every movie/show. Big goofy looking eyes, playing it casual, no commitment, etc."
5,"Excellent, of course","I watched all the episodes of this show as they came on, but owning them has made going through the season just as hilarious as the first time through. Worth the purchase!"
2,like the actress but pilot dumb,"The actress is one of those really tooooo cute kids and I really like seeeing her, but this pilot was dumb-but of course I am an old dude-so probably figures--this was not made for old folks"
3,Meh,"It's okay, funny, whatever. With Hulu, there is really no need for me to purchase seasons of anything. Besides I'm not a huge TV watcher. If I miss it - oh well."
5,can't wait for season 2!,"great DVD set. I love the show, and the DVD comment extras were great. That cast is naturally just so funny!"
5,New Girl First Season,My daughter and I enjoy watching this show and two of the episodes were such classics she wanted to be able to see anytime she needed a good laugh so I purchased it as a Christmas present for her
4,Funny!,I love Zooey Deschanel and was thrilled when I heard she was on her own show! A hysterical look at a girl who lives with three male roommates. Zooey's character is one that I cannot pictures anyone else being able to play the way she does.
4,Love it!,I look forward to this show every week. I wish it was longer because I have to wait a whole week for the next one! Zoey Dechanel's character is too funny!
5,delicious ginger drink,"I had a wonderfully strong ginger tea at a Thai restaurant lately, and wanted to find a similar product. This is it - much stronger than traditional ginger tea, this drink has a no-nonsense ginger bite. It has a bit too much sweetening for my tastes, so I cut that by adding more water than recommended. The ginger taste is still strong. I have found this tea in Asian supermarkets as well as on Amazon."
5,delicious - soothing,tried first in Fla. could not find a vendor in Atlanta. so good i looked far and wide to find the a distributor on the web. will order regularly. found some duplicates - this was smoother in taste.
2,Way too strong,This ginger tea was very strong and had too much sugar for my taste. I am going to try half a packet and see if it is better.
5,Dickens would be proud!,"Although my husband is the one who normally watched Xena during the 6 years while it was being produced, I did watch some of them.Of all the ones I saw, ""A Solstice Carol"" is my favorite. I laughed myself silly the first time I saw it and I laugh just as hard every time since. It is such a combination of holiday cliches that you just cannot help it. Even the ""little"" tribute to Hercules brings a laugh (if you recognize him).You have to watch it more than once. You're laughing so hard you're bound to miss some of the jokes the first time through."
5,The drama with Gabrielle,This season was excellent and had a very surprise ending. I can't wait to watch season 4. The Xena series is new to me because I rarely watched it on TV. This season was worth the wait.
4,Oh my!?,Some more even shocking secrets are revealed in season 2. Lots of interesting happening occur. You really need to see this season for some good entertainment.
2,really disappointing quality,"video glitches - sound glitches - very disappointing qualitythe much too brief and inconsequential commentary was also a let down - I expected much more from LL, RT & ROC than the very few minutes of giggles"
3,great show,"Disc 1Orphan of War- 8/10Remember Nothing- 7/10The Giant Killer- 4/10Girls Just Wanna Have Fun- 2/10Disc 2Return of Callisto- don't rememberWarrior...Princess...Tramp- 8/10Intimate Stranger- 10/10Ten Little Warlords- 8/10A Solstice Carol- 6/10The Xena Scrolls- 8/10Here She Comes ...

4,Season Two is a must have,Xena Warrior Princess-Season Two is a must have. I am A big Xena fan and believe that all of the Xena Seasons are a great purchase. I love the comedy as well as the drama that season two has to offer.If your a Xena fan then this is for you.
4,Much better than season one. Still needs improvement.,"The season two set is much better than the first. The actors' commentary is what I was hoping for. The last (7th) disc is much like the season one compainion disc for the pc, and is basically useless for ""hard-core"" Xena fans, everything on it can be found on the web. So why do they keep putting it into the dvd sets? Here's hoping that ""the powers that be"" will realise that they are not going to recruit new fans with these expensive DVD sets, and that they will start catering to those of us who have been here since the begining; with more behind the scenes clips, a full season of actor commentaries (there are only three episodes in this set), and more indepth info about what the ""studio"" wouldn't let them do. Overall, I am very happy with this season two set, and hope that season three will only get better."
2,Xena Warrior Princess:Season 2,Everyone stick with Anchor Bay of any Xena seasons as this is a poorer copy. 2 stars is for DVD quality not show as show is 4 stars. Bought season 1 & 2 as my Anchor Bay season 1 one of the disks were defective & wouldn't play at all. When I compare picture quality of Anchor Bay to this one is obviously poorer quality
4,Nice to see Xena Again,"Same as the season one, this re-release is quite austere (no booklet nor extras), the image is acceptable, but they really need to improve the sound and subtitle feature.It's a shame that they have no extras, or bloopers... but for the price is a good deal, I hope they continue releasing the following seasons :D"
4,Luscious collection with a few hesitations,"Starring an assortment of black lesbian dancers, this collection of stories maps the styles and moves of these women as they pour their passions out through their bodies. The plots vary from story to story, but Allegra's lush writing style stays strong, although in a couple of stories it's muted when the story stretches past its limits, but the energy picks up again by the time the title novella is reached. It is this passion in the women's lives though that lingers with the reader, whether it's passion for the rhythms, passion for another woman, or passion for what dancing can evoke in spectators or dancers. Allegra whets the reader's appetite with these tales, and leaves us breathless for more."
2,Marker Pens,"These marker pens are fine point, but because they are markers, they bleed to a font about the size of a normal fine point. I was looking for something that would cut my paper because it was so fine, and this did not satisfy me. They also bleed on my hands. There appears to be a hole next to the tip that I cover with my finger when I write. This causes some sort of pressure issue that makes my thumbs black. If you want MARKER pens, then this is for the fine point enthusiast. If you want to scratch your paper, then get a ball point. Rated 2 stars because of the bleeding issue on hands."
3,Super fine?,I was disappointed because the point is supposed to be 0.2mm so I was expecting to get a very fine line. I can't tell the difference between the super fine point and the regular point. I won't buy again.
2,the pen tip often breaks off,"For whatever reason, they made the pen tip weaker on these than the original version and it snaps off a lot. The pen is almost useless then. Also the cap is so tight its a real effort to get it off whenever you want to write"
2,this is NOT a pack of 12 pens as indicated,"great pen! what the reviews say about the qualities of the pen are accurate. however, don't be duped! The description says that it's a pack of 12 pens and that's why I ordered this product! when it arrived, however, there was one lonely pen in the package! seems like a scam to me!"
5,My favorite pen,"As a designer, we all have strange needs when it comes to our writing instruments. Well, this one is mine.I love the fine point of the Razor II and cannot seem to find this pen at many locations, thus I buy them in bulk from Amazon because I am always losing them to friends who try mine and end up keeping them.These pens don't spit, they don't over ink anything - it is a beautiful tip that has never been bettered in the years it has been around.Best pen for the money out there!!!!!"
4,"Great pen, fine-tipped, but kinda stiff.","These are great pens, but the caps are really hard to pull off. On the plus side, the metal clips are almost indestructible. If you like the Pilot Razor Point, you'll like this fine-tipped pen even more. Maybe it would be good if you have little kids - they'd never get the cap off! But don't buy them for Grandma!Nevertheless, they are sturdy, well made, and none have leaked so far."
3,it was ok,I thought it started out good and had some very enteraining parts. I thought the use of Black and White and Color was well done to differenciate different parts of the movie. But as a whole it was lacking is some intangable way that prevented it from being a great movie.
1,???,"I have to disagree with the person below me (grinalltheway) when they say that the only person whose appeared in this movie and has gone on to do more was jenya. My uncle is in this movie,matt casado,haha and although he was in this movie as cop # 2 hes done quite a few independent films afterwards...this movie wasnt too bad in the beginning,but i had problems keeping up with it and just turned it off...i only bought it cuz my uncle was in it,and thats the only reaosn you should by this is if you knew someone in the movie..."
1,The worst book on linear regression,This book is the worst one I ever read about on the topic of linear regression.No rigorous proofs and no clear explanations.This book should be worth less than 20 dollars while its price is over $100! So the author must care much more about money than academic work.
1,"Overly heuristic, filled with errors","An absolutely terrible text. The book rarely offers anything remotely resembling rigorous derivations (almost entirely heuristic arguments), and as often as not has errors in the derivations they do present. On top of that, the R package written for this text by the author (package ""alr3"") contains errors as well. In order to complete the exercises provided in the text, you actually have to EDIT the provided functions.Overall, this is an inexcusably bad book.If it's required for a class, see if you can get it from the library, and buyApplied Linear Statistical Modelsfor reference instead. The notation is a little different, but the notational issues are a small price to pay for actually knowing what's going on."
3,It's Alright.,"when i was deployed to incirlik, turkey i fell in love with the apple tea. this product is okay, but has a stale after taste that takes away from the product. going to still keep looking for apple tea that is like what i had when i was overseas."
3,an inspirational and moving book!,This book was really a tear jerker. I made me think of how fortunate I really am to have a loving and caring family.It's the type of novel that is hard to put down at times cause I was so curious about what was going to happen next. The author really went into depth about the feelings of each of the childer. I reccommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading novels by Caroline B.Cooney!
1,Bringing Ufos Down to Earth,"This book is terrible. Phillip J Klass is a skeptic who is too afraid to accept the truth, yes alot of ufo's can be explained as ordinart, but what about the roswell ufo crash? military spy ballon? i think not, theres evidence that tells of something out of this world,[] A more appropriate book would be by Allen J. Hynek. UFO books by skeptics encourage kids to have closed minds and to accept anything as natural phenomena without investigation. The truth is out there."
1,Beware!,A more appropriate introduction would be any book by Hynek or Vallee. Young readers should also check the bookshelves at their schools. Avoid this one like the plague!!!!
4,Very Good,"Not easily cleanable. Otherwise great. It's not a hard case, but it's sturdy enough. Don't stack anything heavy at all on this."
2,Cardboard doesn't fit well,"Other reviews had liked this product. When I got it, the cardboard dividers and support for the sides were too tall for the zipper to close. I am going to have to cut every piece down to size. Not what I had planned on doing with my time."
5,The Title Says It All!,"I give this five stars because it is exactly what it appears to be. This is not a slick studio production for the mass market. Its a master finger-style arranger/composer ""sittin' back pickin' some great stuff. While the rest of us were listening to and admiring Chet, John Knowles is one of the pickers Chet was listening to and admiring."
1,"Honestly, I didn't like it","Personally, I find the explanations that I have so far looked at scanty and lacking evidence to support the stated theories. For example, LaHaye (or possibly not him, but one of the other 48 or so scholars that helped write it) claimed in one section that there are enough differences in ""second coming"" verses to distinguish between two different events: the rapture and the second coming, of course. However, he failed to point out what the differences were. I would suggest that anyone who owns this (or is thinking of owning this) investigate other theories, at least as far as the rapture is concerned, as well."
3,Another 20 page book expanded into 170,"Just like the Authors first book onthe LAW, this one could have been 20 pages long with some editing and organization.Overall, the concept (the LAW) is worth knowing, just be aware that at higher levels its not as accurate as Cohen and Marty Bergen would have you think.Its worth knowing about the LAW, just from a much shorter better presented source."
4,Female and over 20,"Metal Slug - I wasn't sure that I would like this game though Iwas looking for a true arcade type shooter. Talk about having anadrelin rush! I could not put this game down! And I am a female and way over twenty. Though I really didn't want my son playing with this game, we gave in and now I have to take turns with him. Though this is really not a game for children, it is a great game for adults."
4,Almost as good as the arcade,"This game is without a doubt one of the best on the Neo pocket. SNK did an excellent job of replicating the arcade experience on their new portable system. Control is tight, graphics are just as detailed as the arcade version, and the game is challenging, but not over the top. Make it your first purchase."
5,Action Packed Freaky Fun,"This game is amazing! To start, Metal Slug is a great game. I wouldn't have thought that if it went to handheld system that it would have been good. But it is! Its GREAT!You'r a lone soldier that fights through masses of enemies, sometimes acompanied by Metal Slug (a tank that the game is named after), a jet, and some other vehicles. The control is very responsive due to the great Neogeo Pocket Color's joy-stick. The graphics are amazing and really DO push the limits of the NGPC (just like any other SNK produced game).Looking for a fun game? Look no further. This game holds true to its arcade roots. You do experience some slow down at times, but its understandable when alot of stuff is blowing up. This game is a MUST HAVE FOR ANYONE WHO OWNS A NEOGEO POCKET COLOR."
3,an arcade classic in the palm of your hands,"Just like its older brother, action games on the NeoGeo Pocket are few and far between. Metal Slug seems to fill the void nicely. The graphics are nice and the music is translated flawlessly from the arcade counter-part. This version also sports a ton of new levels and gameplay challenging enough to keep the most rabid of fans on their toes. However, the game is not perfect. Some parts of the game are so difficult to complete that I found myself pulling my hair in utter frustration. Metal Slug can also become a bit repetitive as the game progresses, with the same shoot, jump, shoot, duck tactics played throughout the game. Though hardly perfect, Metal Slug on the Neo Geo Pocket is an excellent diversion from all the fighting games and fans especially will appreciate this portable title."
5,The book is the best!,"I think the book was great! It's about when the saddle club's going on the MTO (Mountain Trail Overnight) and this time Phil's coming along too! Stevie is really exited, but when Jo Novick comes and asks Stevie to help him with his horse, Phil sees and gets Jealous. So he goes and helps Betsy Cavangh, and Stevie is not really happy with him. Things go from bad, to worse when the MTO starts. I thought it was funny when Carole dreamed of swatting giant Mosquitoes and instead hit Stevie in real life instead! I recomend this book to peale who love horses!"
5,Vitalij Margulis/Chopin,"This is the best interpretation* of Chopin's Funeral March I listened for so far.*performed by Vitalij Margulis. Critics spoke of him as a ""secret genius"" (Joachim Kaiser, Süddeutsche Zeitung) and a ""world class pianist"" (Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung)."
5,Ink cartridges that are best for me,"My rating is based on the fact that I have been using a Jetprinter Z55 printer for 2 years long. During this time I have used a variety of after market ink cartridges as well as self fill cartridges for printing photos or documents. None of these provided the print quality as this cartridge form Eforcity. As such, I would like to only buy ink cartridge form Eforcity."
2,Review of Eforcity Black Ink Cartridge,"This review is for the cartridge used in an older Lexmark Z55 printer, which works great. The cartridge wasvery cheap and easy to order but the print quality is much poorer than the standard HP (much more expensive)cartridge, with many minute skips in the ink laydown. Changing the text print quality does not have anydiscernable impact. This would be ok if it was for draft quality prints, it is certainly going to be achallenge to use for writing / graphics that require consistent ink laydown."
1,crap,"It came out of the package with ink powder all over it, a big mess. The ink prints as though its at the end, not new. Beyond disappointed, will never order from this place or even on line again."
2,Protestant Theology,Fails to provide sound and balanced arguments. Somewhat confused logic which is not unexpected since this movement has been confused since the Reformation.
4,A cute film,"My children ages 4 and 6 enjoy this film. I'd also recommend ""Bob the Builder A Christmas to Remember."" That was the first Bob film we purchased and I can't tell you how many times we've played it. Elton John is in it and it's a hoot. I have found that that films with Neil Morrissey as the voice of Bob are more enjoyable to my children than the ones with some other person doing Bob's voice."
5,MY BOYS AND LITTLE GIRL LOVE THIS CHRISTMAS VIDEO!!!,"I made this purchase for my youngest son who just turned 2 on Dec. 8, 2002. Since he is a HUGE BOB THE BUILDER FAN!!!! And he was born so close to Christmas I thought this would be neat to give as a birthday gift. Well, I couldn't wait to give it to him and he watches it at least 2 times a day! He Loves it and so does BIG BROTHER AND BIG SISTER!"
3,Great Fun For Kids,"The ""Bob The Builder"" series is great for toddlers. My 2 year old son loves to watch them over and over. They show various characters in sometimes frustating circumstances (just like real life) and show how normal fears can be overcome. The comraderie between Bob, his wife, and all the personified trucks, cement mixers, etc. is very positive. It shows that different ""people"" can get along and that helping others is rewarding.My only complaint, and the reason this only gets 3 stars, is the 5 minutes of commercials tacked on the beginning of the tape. The studio hawks it's wares to innocent toddlers like carnival hucksters, even using the voice of a young child to sell it's goods. As if the whole ""Bob The Builder"" marketing world wasn't big enough. My kid shouldn't be teased every time he watches these tapes. They certianly could learn a lesson in humility from ""Bob""."
3,Meh...,"My son is a Bob fan but for some reason he's just not into this movie. I haven't really watched it to try and figure out why, I just figure that even at 3 years old my son knows what he likes and doesn't like."
5,Great applique,Contains great instructions and patterns for modern applique. I love the printed patterns in the back of the book which eliminates trying to enlarge them for use as in some publications. Good book all around and I highly recommend it.
3,"Good history of the men's games, but...","Baltzell has put together a really good historical piece on men's tennis, but he draws some pretty far-reaching conclusions about the superiority of pre-war Anglo-American culture from, among other things, the number of non-English-speaking countries that have won the Davis Cup since the advent of open tennis. It's an excellent read for the history, but be ready for some sociological conclusions that are based on shaky evidence."
4,Great on a Kindle,I like watching Xena on tv and this is so cool to have on my Kindle. I only watched two episodes. Too expensive if you buy one episode at a time.
2,ok,Disk 1 - 5 was perfect but disk 6 - 8 had a corrupt file and ended up gliching on the final episode on each disk I had to use my laptop to view them
2,Never order from YouLikeThat!!!!!!!!!!,"The dvd box set came in horrible condition! I think they are selling used ones as new because the box was defiantly not new by any means!!! They don't even properly package the dvd box sets! No wonder it got to me dented and scratched.But as for the season it's self I can not wait to watch it, Xena is the best."
3,Could have been better,Quick delivery and well packaged but there was a problem; on each DVD the middle episode would not play. The rest played fine. Wrote the seller but didn't hear back...? I didn't have any problem with the other series I bought from same seller at the same time-go figure.
5,one of the best seasons,third seasons reacintly have sucked like querr as folk alias i never watch it but heard its bad and the notrosis angel season three butr xenas different it gets even darkjer in this season and we see alot more of calluisto xenas moszt loved psycho and the death of xenas son is shocking caused by hope from season two a child with unstoppable powewres
2,Xena series 3,"Although the service was very good and I received the video quickly, I was disappointed in the discs themselves. For some reason, at least one episode will not play on each disc. This happened when I purchased Xena series 2 using Amazon.com. I did not keep the sales information on that order so I don't know if it is from the same company. I find this disheartening and discouraging. Someone suggested that these were probably bootleg items. I would hope not. Eventually, I plan on buying the rest of the series, so I am hoping the contents are better. By the way, both purchases bragged that the orders were unopened and factory sealed."
5,Another great season!,"This may contain spoilers, so be warned.I enjoyed this season very much because it had a bit more of an ongoing story arc. More like two or three. I enjoyed the rift arc, but didn't particularly enjoy The Bitter Suite as a closure episode. I'm all for musicals, don't get me wrong, but it just wasn't my cup of tea. The Hope story line was very well written, and I was hooked from the Deliverer all the way to Sacrifice. When in Rome was another great episode because we got another look at the character of Caesar. It would have been nice to see a Xena episode in which fans actually get to see the civil war between Caesar and Pompi begin though. I really enjoyed the whole Roman arc from second to fourth season. And as always, Kevin Smith delivered wonderful performances as Ares. If you haven't seen it yet, and if you have the cash, this season is defenatly worth picking up."
3,mixed feelings,"I am split over this season. I enjoyed the first 2 seasons the most and thought they were terrific. This one left me divided. Half the episodes are hilarious and/or really entertaining. The other half was not for me. For a series that is set in an ancient time of mythology, the first 2 seasons still seemed realistic and believable. The third season went a different direction. Half the episodes were either too weird, or really sad/depressing drama. If you enjoyed the good/happy times of the first 2 seasons, get ready to say goodbye to that. I realize I am in the complete minority on this review. Most people seemed to like the direction the last 4 seasons went. But for me, I was disappointed because it turned away from what it originally was."
5,The Season that got me Hooked,"Xena's third season by far surpassed the previous seasons by my standards. This season is full episodes you'll enjoy watching over and over again. Out of all six seasons this one is marked #1 in my book. Why? I honestly don't know. The first two seasons I enjoyed greatly, but I really didn't care if I missed an episode or two, but once this season came about the idea of missing an episode was no longer bearable. So many episodes stand out in this season. Besides learning of Xena's past in Asia her greatest enemy Callisto returns in three episodes, one in particular Maternal Instincts which is my favorite episode of the season. Plus a fantastic finale that drove fans crazy for months till the next season started. Favorite season or not any fan of Xena will want this in their collection."
4,left hanging,"well i got all the way to disc #8 and there was nothing on the dvd, and i was wardering if it were possible that you could send me dvd #8 which had episodes 20,21,22, sacrifice 1,2,and 3 ilook forward in hearing from you on this matter thank you georgine p.s. i look forward in doing more bussiness with you at a later date"
1,CD format!!!,"This is outrageous, I bought this for my father, who's a huge fan of Zena, only to hear that the disks' format was CD and NOT DVD as stated, and it therefore had no subtitles, which were important to my father because he's not a native English speaker. I'm dissapointed, Amazon never did such a misleading thing to me before."
5,An amazing capture of womanhood at its finest,"Season three,All I can say is I know I saw Callisto and Lao'slips on Xena...sweet lesbian hayday.Women prancing around strong and proud and in leather..enough said ...buy it now!!!!!"
3,"Decent performance, undecent sound quality","Not bad, but could be better. The best thing about this version is the atmosfere, the general feeling. It manages to feel the dark impress of this Requiem. Especially the ""Tuba mirum"", ""Recordare"", the terrific passage with words ""ne perenni cremer igne"". But the worst thing is the recording quality, which sounds like being caught at rehearsals or public concert, near the conductor. You can even hear his baton as prepares for the next part! But anyway, for this price is a decent recording."
2,"Piece, Not Performance","This is easily the worst recording I have heard, not only of Mozart's piece, but of any classic work. The ensemble is terribly balanced, Petri squeaks and sputters, the bass solo beginning the Tuba Mirum falls bizarrely flat, there are times when decidedly wrong notes are heard, etc. Robert Overpelt, the solo tenor, is the only bright spot on the disc. A powerful, intense work, but don't allow this recording to be your introduction."
2,Not Good...,"This is the worst recording of one of Mozart's most moving pieces. While it may be appealing to those who have never heard other versions of the requiem, those who love THE REQUIEM will find this version uninspiring. The soprano chokes her way through the entire piece, and has a shrill vocal quality that ruins the mood. If you want to hear a good version of the requiem pony up the cash and buy a better version."
2,Timpani anyone?,"I've rarely heard such poor sound engineering in all my life. The entire piece is absolutely dominated by the overpowering timpani, leaving the rest of the ensamble struggling just to be heard. The soprano is fair at best, the conducting is adequate, and the orchestra is all right. If it weren't for the damn timpani, I could bare this $4 recording, but having recently bought Robert Shaw's on Telarc, I simply cannot justify buying this recording even at the attractive price."
2,"cute, not functional","The face is so cool that you can barely read it. I liked having it as a ""dress watch"" I wouldn't mind running in. Was very sad when the band broke about 5 months into ownership. I guess it's that other brand that 'takes a licking....'"
2,"Pretty, but band broke twice in one year","I love the look of this watch, as it's small and interesting looking and attracts compliments. I also love that it's a digital watch but not clunky or with a large interface. However, the band broke four months into wearing it. I sent it back since there is a year warranty and it's not the kind of band you can replace. Now I am at my year mark of owning it, and the band is ready to go again. Don't count on this watch for everyday wear."
1,not very funny,"I am a fan of movies that are ""stupid/funny"" and even some that are just stupid. This one is neither. At least stupid has some sort of substance. Not this. It's like a black hole that sucks time out of our already presciously short lives. I also give extra points to low budget flicks because they have more to prove. Not this. It's still hopeless. To try and describe the plot would be impossible for reasons that will become evident if you watch it. bad. really bad."
5,Uses Illustrator resources to the fullest,"I found this book very helpful. The author makes a consistent effort to use the drawings, templates and tools that ship with Illustrator and use them creatively. The book is especially helpful for projects that need to be completed in a very short time. None of the art or templates is used as is; they are all modified and adapted to the task at hand. I highly recommend this book to the advanced beginner or intermediate Illustrator user."
3,Ups and Downs to This,"I love that the songs don't mix into each other because that annoys me. I hate how part of the song always gets chopped off. What I don't like about this is the Pink and Dream songs because the remixes don't really sound like they fit with the vocals. Other than that, I really do like this collection."
1,Hot Tools 1875 Dryer - Not Great,Lack of vents on the sides and in front slow drying time. Impossible to adjust hood height.
3,A fine collection of essays edited poorly,"This book is a fine collection of articles and essays with little editorial supervision. The breadth of the articles means that you're sure to find something useful to your interests whether you be freelancer or corporate design director. There are even sample contracts.However, this book is very poorly edited. The ""its"" vs. ""it's"" confusion runs rampant throughout (just to name one example) and there are more typos than I would expect to find in a book written for a detail-oriented audience such as designers. Sloppy.Also, quite a bit of the material is out of date. If you're looking for something that speaks to professional design practices as they relate to the World Wide Web, this is _not_ your book. Very few of the articles in this book deal with the web at all, and those that do tangentially touch upon the Internet sound like they were written in 1995."
1,Not such good condition,"When I bought my book, the website said it was in good condition, yet when I got it there was a hole in the cover that was covered up by a giant sticker. I tried to remove the sicker and just ended up with a mess!"
2,Not happy about shipping,I bought this book for a class I was taking. It said when I purchased the item that it would take 5-8 days to get here but it took almost a month. My class started and I had no book - very frustrating.
1,Annoying!,"This is one frustrating textbook to be assigned. The organization and design are really poor. For example: Design - the text will be cut off mid-sentence by a diagram that you don't need to look at until the next page, when you have to flip back and forth to refer to it. Organization - information is scattered about so you feel like you're reading the same [boring] thing 20 times, so you start skimming, but then you miss the one kernel of information that's added each time (the book would be shorter, lighter, AND easier to read if it were organized better). Also, the author includes full citations for everything, like a term paper (a loooong one), so you can lose track of the sentence you're reading by trying to hunt through all the names and dates to find the information. Footnotes, anyone?!Sheesh. This is going to be a long semester..."
4,Great Book,This book was assigned by my Grad Instructor and it has really helped me grasp the world of Assessments. Thank you.
3,Assessing Learners with Special Needs,"I found this book to be redundant of all of the classes I had already taken. However, if you are taking the Praxis in Special Education, there are a lot of things you will find in this book to help you. I read it before I took the exam. It was easy for me to read, but I think it was also do to the fact that I learned everything in another course.In my class it wasn't even required because he goes over everything in lecture, plus the class is about actually giving assessments.If you buy the book, don't worry about its condition as long as you can read it!"
3,Needed for Graduate School,This book was a required purchase for graduate school. It is very informative and defines terminology in a way that is comprehendable.
5,Producing a Different Kind of Image,"In spite of the title, this book actually covers both film and digital photography in the infrared range.Infrared light is close in the spectrum to heat. As a result, cold things like trees and water dramatically change their appearance. And the warm skin of people put out a more intense image.Again because of the heat effect, skin blemishes such as acne tend to disappear. This may offer some distinct advantages in photographing young people. Likewise the somewhat strange effect produced by infrared photography may have effects that appeal in industrial or commercial shoots.Profusely illustrated, this book illustrates what is possible."
2,Not very helpful,"While this book is full of great photographs, there is little practical information which will help the aspiring digital infrared photographer achieve similar results. More of an advertising portfolio, in my humble opinion."
3,Too many weddings and not enough landscape,Although the picture examples were very good I feel that most amateurs experimenting with infrared will be taking landscape rather than wedding pictures.It is a great pity therefore that this book seemed to concentrate on wedding photgraphs rather than a broader aspect of infrared.
1,BIG CAUTION,"LOOK OUT,The review for this movie actually refers to the 2001 Kidman movie. This 1997 title of the same name IS NOT THE KIDMAN MOVIE. Be warnedp.s Have you seen Lost and Delirious yet. Excellent movie!"
4,As expected...,"The propeller seems fine. It is a replacement part for my husband's hobby plane. He hasn't needed it yet, but it looks fine. Received it quickly!"
2,nerds in space,"These performances differ little from Man Or Astroman?'s studio CDs. The drummer has a bit of a problem keeping up, and the recording isn't that great. The main difference is the nerdy banter between songs, laced with some obscenities. Apparently this venue was like the redneck bar in ""Blues Brothers.""I'm tired of the cheesy Sci-Fi flick soundbites. I have ""Is It Man Or Astroman?"", ""Project Infinity,"" and ""IV TV."" I think that's all I need of Man Or Astroman? (But then I bought ""Deluxe Men In Space"" and ""Experiment Zero."")"
2,transmissions from theiranus,"You know, Man or Astro-man? has some great albums out. ""Project Infinity"", ""Is It ... Man or Astroman?"", ""Destroy All Astromen!"". This isn't one. I've seen this band live a few times and they [...] each time. Damn fine performers. It's been years since I saw 'em though and I felt I might get that experience of a live show with ""Live Transmissions From Uranus"". I don't remember them talking so much when I saw them. I recall some jokes, but mainly them playing their unique blend of surf rock mixed with elements of new wave and punk, weird sound effects, and of course sound bites of sci-fi B movies. They ruined this album by running their mouths way, way too much onstage. They don't even pull off their jokes, talking over each other and crap. Somebody actually yells from the crowd for them to talk less and play more. I couldn't have agreed more. Weird."
4,Cute,This item went over big at grandmas house! The 11 year olds down to the 2 year olds as well as the dogs!
3,Loved it while it lasted,Purchased for a 2 year old. She loved playing with it in Summer. Unfortunately after a month it broke. The fish doesn't work anymore even though we replaced the batteries and made sure there was no water inside. It just stopped working. Otherwise awesome idea.
3,Catch of the Day...,"I love this toy. I got it for my daughter's 3rd birthday at the end of July(2012). She played with it in a large wading pool a few times. I took it out just before Christmas (2012) to show a friend, but could not get it to work. The light comes on, but no movement at all. It was only used in August and September. This is an awesome toy, but it didn't last very long for me. It was only used a few times and then put away for the cooler months. We only used it in the wading pool not in the bath tub or pond. I am almost tempted to give it another try. I am going to go through the reviews and see how many have had the same problem. Also, the rod and reel is so-so. I put the lures on my daughter's real rod and reel after the string broke on the toy one and was retracted into the spool."
1,Not for cats!!!,"Very disappointed. I bought this for my cat, but it doesn't cast well with her toy attached. Plus, the reel is so small and makes too much noise. Maybe good for children, but not your cat."
2,Broke after a few uses!,Would be a great toy if it didn't stop working after 3 uses..The fish no longer swims. My 3 year old son still likes it but the quality needs improvement.
2,"good concept, just a little too cheap in its production","cheap, plastic feel. the fish split a bit so i worried about exposure of the battery to water. perhaps the split in the fish is why even with a fully charged battery in a wading pool, the fish didn't really move around with sufficient velocity or balance."
4,Just what we were seeking,Our aspiring fisherman will love this toy when Santa makes his delivery. We hope to change this to a 5 once it is put to use.
3,Broke after 5 minutes,"The trigger on the handle that releases the line stopped working. In for a refund. Other than this, the product appears to be very nice quality and the fish is pretty cool. as soon as the lure attaches to its mouth, via a magnet, it thrashes around. Too bad it broke so quickly. I might give it another try after getting a refund."
4,It's fun!!!,The rod is little too small compare to size of the fish. The rod is only about 18 inches long. The fish is real fun in and out of water. You can use the fish on other rods if you can attach the bait. I would recommand this to anyone who wants to introduce fishing to their youngsters.
