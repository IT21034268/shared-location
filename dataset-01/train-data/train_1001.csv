5,A must for the serious or historically bent autophile,"Comprehensive in reach/scope if not every detail, this book is an essential part of even a tiny research library for those interested in answering the questions of looks or specs on cars from the distant and recent past. Although listing only through 1990 models, more recent are rarely deemed potential collectibles, and so the relevance is largely unscathed by the decade plus since publication.Styling and mechanical changes and specs for every model of every listed year (1930-1990) fit all but the most detailed needs. Whether used for perusing alternatives for the first/next purchase, checking production runs to assess rarity or looking at 13 year-old valuations, this book was and still is a gem."
5,utterly original,"this is music for those yearning for something new. defies description and category....melodic, moving, symphonic....like the title, both hopeful and holding despair...."
3,A bit uneven,"This has some definite highs and some definite lows. There are some great tracks on this disc, including 'Racing Daylight', which has this fabulous retro 80s sound, reminiscent perhaps of Echo & The Bunnymen, or Modern English. But other songs seem to just wander out into the weeds and get lost...with too many lines that just go 'la la la, la la la' for my taste (I'll admit, a pet peeve of mine - c'mon folks, at least write some lyrics if you're going to sing, and save the la la la for Christmas carols). I agree with other reviewers that the vocals sound a bit bono-esque. Not that this is necessarily a good nor a bad thing."
2,Not worth the cost,"I decided to buy this book as I'm always looking for something about this matter, as I'm a self defence instructor for policemen, and I find this book really ... empty ! It has NO ONE idea to how really survive in this world, also: following to this book, we should always carry a bowie knife, a long heavy stick, a gun and some other hitting weapon with us. Great defense isn't it ? And a nuclear shelter where to live in? It's even not worth the cost"
3,Practical but outdated,Was fairly well organized with practical info on many aspects of self defense.However this book first published 1999 is very much now out of date.Still the real world point of view was refreshing.
4,Beware Bad Pressings..........,"The praise for Domingo's Tristan is well deserved. The Third Act is excellent, and it is refreshing to hear a performer who isn't squalling by the act's midpoint. My real reason for putting my 2 cents in is the quality of the CD pressings. I have acquired 2 copies of this set and both cannot be read in a CD-ROM drive (on multiple computers) on disc 2 track 10 towards the end. Even the mp3 copy from Amazon has a slight blip at this point. Track 11 on the CD can't even be recognized by the drive. One copy with an error is (maybe) forgivable given the tremendous number of copies made. However, 2 copies with an error at the exact same point means someone at EMI was asleep at the switch. Beware when you buy! Otherwise, an enjoyable performance."
3,Bonus rip-off,"I have not yet listened to the whole of the CDs, but I expect them to be as splendid as the Prelude is. The ""Bonus"" DVD, which is one of the things which attracted me to buy this, on the other hand, is unplayable, which is why I deducted two stars: it sounds like a 78 rpm disc, with Nipper wondering how he can wind up his gramophone with his paws!"
2,Soon forgotten,"Like most of the studio opera recordings of the recent past, this will soon be forgotten. It's ok, but rather pointless, both musically and economically. The essence of Tristan und Isolde cannot be captured in a studio. It is one of the few, if not the only opera that can only be experienced live in the opera house, where it just envelopes you and mesmerizes you. I remember after act 1 of the Jan 30, 1974 Met Tristan with Vickers and Nilsson, people walking around almost in a daze. It has that type of effect on one in a theater. In the recording studio it sounds artificial, even hokey.Get the Bohm/Bayreuth. And if you have ever heard the live Flagstad recordings, you'll know what I mean."
2,"Domingo sings Wagner...Oh, NO!","Do not get me wrong. Domingo is a fine tenor. His timber is Italian and French through and through. At age 60, his Otello remains authentic. His venture into Wagner is a disaster. This Tristan sounds like a jealous Latin lover with little beauty, power and convinction. His voice ruins an otherwise fine recording. I am rewarding the recording 2 stars solely for Wagner's revolutionary yet timeless score."
5,Great knitting book,My goal is to knit every pattern in this book. The items I've knit so far have come out fabulous. The pictures are wonderful. The patterns are easy to read. I am learning a lot about knitting.
4,Exquisite,"This is a wonderful book-nice photography. I can't wait to get started on some of the projects, howerver, I'm having a hard time finding some of the yarns listed."
5,Worth the wait,"I wanted a book on this topic as soon as possible, butafter reading thereviews for this one, I felt it was worththe wait.This is a very well balanced and scholarly look at usinghypnosis to better understand the unconsious. It readslike a text book, but is presented very clearly for peoplelike me who are not familiar with hypnosis.I highly recommend this book to anyone who is looking fora better understanding of hypnosis and not just a quickfix.It was worth the wait."
5,great player great DVD....great combination!!!,"Unlike many DVD lessons which are merely video transfers this lesson features audiophile sound and fantastic image quality. Also during the lessons you can use the remote to view either his left or right hand closeups or full view....amazing! there are also bonus songs and the option to view the performance only!!! whether you want to watch this guitarist just play his tunes or get a wonderful lesson this DVD is the real deal ....oh and it is ALL REGION not region 1 as amazon states!!!songs taught performed are: Blue Counterpoint, Indigo Blue, Groove Etude, Midari, Bahama Beach, Go Ahead and Play, Coming Home, and Ebb & Flow"
4,Not too messy but not lasts as long as hoped,"This is billed as top rate best lube. Well it is good alright, I don't know that it is all the hype great. I would buy it again tho."
3,no pain no gain,"Was slightly dissapointed with product. Appears to be mostly waterbased, I prefer oil based for topspeed. The water base goes dry, however the severe fecal action that occurs after the application does make up for it."
1,Bad Product,"Has a really Bad Odor. And my Little Toys often get lost while using this. The pump is also alittle too loose. Needs to be a warming gel so that it can be applied to cold areas and then heat up. Is that a summer sausage in my pocket, or am I happy to see you?"
2,"DO NOT BUY, UNLESS YOU WANT THE BOTTLE",don't buy this unless you want it for the container!the first thing i did when i got it was open it up to look inside and SURPIRSE! its just regular old petroleum jelly with a little water added. you can buy around 4 times as much petroleum jelly at walmart for 3 bucks....its a waste of money
5,"Heartwarming, Sweet & Sexy","I was hooked from page one with this charming romance between a (supposedly) ugly duckling and a charismatic, drop-dead gorgeous artist. I identified with Esme and her shaky self-esteem, and fell in love with Gavino, not just because he was so devastatingly good-looking, but because he is vulnerable, humorous and kind-hearted as well. The interplay between this couple will make you laugh, and bring you close to tears in truly touching moments. A delightful, ""can't put it down"" read. Much like Norah Roberts, Ms. Sandoval has a flair for creating memorable characters that come to life and stay with you long after you read the final page. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
3,Not Bad,"The handle is flimsy, and it does not provide as much space as other bags of this kind I've seen. It is lighter than other bags."
4,Trolly Tote,"I already had this trolly tote for myself and I bought this one for my husband for Christmas. This is a perfect size to use as a carry on for flights. It's not too big or heavy to lift into the overhead bins. It piggy backs nicely with my other Delsey luggage. You can't get a whole week-ends worth of stuff in there, but it's a nice compliment to the other carry on piece that Delsey has."
2,Didn't care for it all,"I didn't find anything useful in this book. It is very, very basic and the chapter of religion at the end was just bizarre. Don't waste your money."
3,"Not bad for the money, but not great either","The chair went together fairly well, and is mostly comfortable to sit in. But it feels like it is not level. I am not able to see anything mechanically wrong with it, but it doesn't feel stable. The assembly instructions could have been better. I use it every day with no problems.Update: After about a year and a half of use, the welds on the chair broke, dumping me on the floor. I no longer recommend this chair."
2,NOT AS PICTURED,MY COMPANY BOUGHT THIS CHAIR IN BURGUNDY FOR ME AS A PRIZE. WHEN WE RECEIVED THE CHAIR IT WASN'T THE SAME AS PICTURED AND WAS BLACK INSTEAD OF BURGUNDY. THE SCREWS ARE PUSHING THRU THE CUSHION ON THE SEAT AND I'M AFRAID THAT THEY'LL EVENTUALLY PUSH THRU THE MATERIAL. OF COURSE THE SEAT ISN'T VERY COMFORTABLE EITHER. I'D NEVER BUY FROM THE GREEN GROUP AGAIN.
1,Very Dissatisfied,"If you buy this product and you have a problem, you need to understand that YOU ARE ON YOUR OWN.Repeated attempts to contact customer service and tech support were unsuccessful. My wife was on the phone for forty-five minutes. I was on the phone for over an hour. Repeated email contacts were ignored. I even engaged a local media outlet to help. One of the local radio stations has a host who has a computer news show. They ignored him too.What was the problem? After the first installation, we couldn't attach to their server to update the definitions. (Yes, we had an active Internet connection). How do you like that. The software is out of date from the first use and you can't do anything about it.Finally, I gave up and bought one of their competitor's products. You should too."
1,Poor Customer Service,"I used Spyware Exterminator 2005 for the past year. Until about six weeks ago, I would have given this product a wonderful evaluation. After updating the spyware definitions, the program quit running. For the past six weeks, the technical support for this product has been unresponsive. I have sent in three different requests on their website. If they will not support their product, then you should not buy this software."
3,documentary not concert,"Although this is fun and interesting in the form of ""Woodstock,"" I was hoping for more of a complete concert to hear all those wonderful voices. Would have preferred something such as ""The Concert for Bangladesh"" format which showed all the influential musicians from that time moving through the entire concert. This was more a live-on-the-bus with hippie musicians, their entourage, and their dog. I would have rather rented it than purchased it."
4,"Terrific music, and a peek at another time","Charming, messy documentary of Joe Cocker's 1970 American tour. Some really fun performances are capturedhere (and, gratefully songs are allowed to pay out at their full length). At the sametime, we get a pretty fascinating voyeur's peek into the odd, wild commune like lifeof Cocker's tour; a huge number of musicians, girlfriends, wives, babies, roadies andthe occasional groupie. And, perhaps funniest of all, the off-screen Cocker - who'son stage energy and almost spastic movements famously make him look like a manpossessed -off-stage seems like a quiet, likeable, thoughtful, even somewhat shyfellow. Not a particularly deep film, but an enjoyable two hours ifyou're at all interested in Cocker and his hard edged rock-blues-gospel approach tosome great classic rock tunes."
5,It was the greatest rock tour ever to hit the states in 1970,"I lived in San Francisco in the early 70's and hit the Fillmore and Avalon many times. I couldn't get to San Bernardino to see them live but the movie of the tour was a mind blowing trip and was one of many tours to go around the U.S. in 1970. A bunch of friends from L.A. came up one weekend in the fall of '70 and we all went out to the theatre on Geary Blvd. and saw the movie. Leon Russell, Bobby Keyes, Rita Coolidge, wow, what a backup band and great singers they were. The album (CD nowadays) brings back so many memories, and yes, pass the joint when you watch the movie (DVD) and see what many concerts were like at the Fillmore. These guys were fabulous and to this day, I can still say, I love Joe Cocker. God he was on...nothin' matches the intensity he had. Great stuff..."
3,Crazy pills,"I've read lots of reviews saying the music and performers are great but the dvd sucks. To me, you should reverse that. I adore classic music but am I really the only one who thinks this concert and Joe Cocker's work in general are just....kind of boring? There are great songs in the mix here but none of them hit me. And I love Leon Russell's solo career but I just can't get into this. But I don't think you could ask for a better dvd. The packaging alone, with a phenomenal booklet, are worth the price for it."
2,"rockumentary , not a live recording.","i thought this was the live 'album'with the radio vertion of ' the letter'. instead it is a dvd with alot of concert footage, and a shorter vertion of 'the letter' ."
3,I'm interested...,"I have NO LOVE for (Drill Sgt) Leon Russell, but I could dig seeing a young Joe Cocker. But the REAL reason I'm inquiring about MD&E is, well, about the Ladies: A) HOW prominently featured is one the most beautiful women of all time, Claudia Linnear? and secondly B) I know that Fanny's Nicky Barclay is a vocalist on this, too. I have never...quite...gotten...over seeing and doing a show with Fanny in 12/71, so is Nicky featured at all on this? PLEASE?"
2,RE-ISSUE - SHOULD HAVE DONE BETTER,"I was keen to see this film in its newly re-issued format but was horrified with the sound quality. So many rock doco's of the past have been beautifully remastered (eg Concert for Bangladesh, Elvis - Thats the way it is, to name just two) and yet this opportunity to blast what was a spectacular musical journey right into the new millennium fails to deliver.The CD soundtrack gets it right (sort of) but the DVD is poor and there can surely be no excuses. I feel for Joe Cocker because this event whether he enjoyed the experience or not captured him at his peak and this re-issue should have been a modernised legacy of what a great showman he was in his prime.I put this on expecting my surround sound to fill the room with this great music but regrettably it simply doesnt have the spark.Buy it for novelty value but dont expect the Space Captain to fill your room with a wall of sound."
2,back in the day,"Back in the day there were two theatrical-release rock concert films--Woodstock, and Joe Cocker's Mad Dogs. If ever there was a candidate for full screen DVD digitization, this is it. Don't waste you money on the VHS scan and pan Mad Dogs. You won't get half the effect of the original film, much less the multiple screen images of the fabulous band, put through their paces by Leon Russell and Chris Stainton. In the meantime, while you're waiting for them to rescue the original print, clean it up, and stamp out the DVDs, you can get a sense of the film's great soundtrack with the Mad Dogs CD, though with a slightly different selection of songs by Joe and a supporting cast of around forty."
3,"When He's On, It's Great. Unfortunately....","I will admit, it was the original album that I heard, and never saw this film until now. When he's on stage, I can almost forgive the poor video quality, and so-so sound because of the energy that's on stage. When he is not on stage, it's dull, boring, confusing, and out-dated. I wish A&M would have made a Concert Only mode (I would have enjoyed 80 or 90 minutes of concert over 30 or 40 minutes of fans, roadies, band members, and groupies). Also the soundtrack is better soundwise, and also has more songs (Cry Me A River is one I can think of that's missing from the film that's on the soundtrack). All & all, the film is not as good as the soundtrack CD. I also agree with the gentleman that mentioned Concert For Bangladesh."
3,Great snaphot of the times,"If you are looking for ultimate sound and vision, this is a bad choice. If you are happy to forego those things, this is still a great record of an era and of a great talent's hey day. As has been observed by other reviewers, some notable performances from the LP/CD soundtrack are absent (Superstar and Cry Me a River for example) - disappointing. Is this really approaching 40 years ago??? I feel so old."
5,CLASSIC COCKER,I bought this DVD for my Boyfriend as a Birthday gift. He absolutely loved it!! The music was great and it transported us back in time to when great lyrics reigned supreme.Very soulful and bluesy. Highly recommend that anyone who is a Joe Cocker fan add this to their collection.
5,COCKER POWER!,"This video is FABULOUS. This is Cocker at his peak. His gravelly voice was never better than during this period in his career. And what is most entertaining, his spasmodic style of performing was never more pronounced. Even if you are not a Cocker fan, or have never really heard him, I would bet you will enjoy this greatly. Even if you hate his music, just watch this video with the sound off- you'll laugh the entire time!"
3,I wanted to love this video,"This review is for the DVD and not the CD or album of the same name. The biggest disappointment was the fact that more time is spent on buses and planes than on the stage. Hey, it's a concert film and not some form of Hope and Crosby version of a Road movie. I love the CD and this film adds nothing to the experience of this legendary concert experience."
5,Mad Dogs & Englishmen - Joe Cocker,"One of the best rock documentaries ever made. I've seen it many, many times over the years and it still holds up."
3,Claudia( Ms. Brown Sugar)Linnear - Hot Damn!!!,OK film as far as a retrospective.As a DVD it was maudlin. The audio was 'hissy' & the video was 'dull' . It looked as though it had bee copied from a VHS.Good film but it just didn't live up to its HYPE. But then there's Claudia!
3,Disappointed!,"I'm a leftover hippie and remember the movie and how much it showed the ""commune"" spirit of the time. However, there were a couple of songs listed that were not on the DVD- notibly, Rita Coolidge's ""Superstar"", which is the song I most wanted to here. I should have bought the more expensive one but felt I was misled. I don't think the sound was very good but enjoyed it anyway."
3,mad dogs and englishmen,"I got this movie as a gift. i have never seen it, but my friend says it's cool"
3,badly produced dvd,"Nothing ""glorious"" about this Brazilian version of Mad Dogs. Looks and sounds like a 30 year old video tape. And where is Cry me a river? Could the best song from the soundtrack really have been omitted from the film?"
2,Mad Dogs and Englishmen,I am not sure if the movie itself was poorly made or if the DVD was cheap. This shouldn't reflect on the seller but it is pretty cheap.
5,peltier thermo-electric module,"The Thermoelectric unit I ordered came in great condition in a safe packaging, there was no cracks or damge to the ceremic unit. The Pelier module works perfectly in every way and is a perfect heat mover and great tool to experiment with. Thanks!"
1,Does not stay together,The cage itself is not to bad but if you try to do any add ons it is horrible. You can only connect other Hartz products to it which are hard to find. The ones you can find do not stay together. I bought the play center and it will not even hold together for a dwarf hamster. I had to go buy super glue and glue it together. Now we can not move any of the pieces but at least my hamster will not fall again when the whole thing comes tumbling. Awful design and product. I would not recommend this product to anyone.
1,Don't waste your money!,This thing is a piece of garbage! It was broken before I could even get the hamster in it. The plastic door latch hook snapped off when I was putting it together. It was also missing a spigot for the water bottle. It's not hard to put together but it's very small and wobbly...not stable at all. I felt like I threw my money away. :o(Disappointed grandma
2,Spend more and get a better cage,This is very low quality. One of the plastic tabs broke during assembly. We also couldn't get the wheel apart to clean the feces out and when our hampster hung out in there his long hair was matted with poo. We took it off and threw it away. Now we have a wheel inside of the cage which leaves very little room for the hamsters (we have two). I need to join it to another cage to give them more space but don't know if I want to spend more money on Hartz products (also need to order online b/c the pet stores don't carry hartz)
1,Junk,"I bought this cage in a pinch because our 2 gerbils suddenly began fighting (violently) and I needed to permanently separate them based on the vet's recommendation. I went to Wal Mart and this was one of 2 cages available so I bought it. Simply put: I hate it. It was difficult to assemble and the instructions were pitiful (simply illustrations with no text). A picture with the word ""snap"" gives no indication that the piece is practically going to have to be hammered into place before it will ""snap"" (if it even ""snaps"" at all). The gerbil has chewed away plastic on the inner part of the wheel so I don't plan to keep this as her home because I fear she will chew her way out and we'll have a loose gerbil. It will be downgraded to a play spot while we are changing the gerbils' bedding and that's it. I would not recommend this at all... total waste of money."
2,Does not Expand as advertized.,I bought this cage in hopes to buy the assecories to go with it. After weeks of searching online I find two tubes here on Amazon that will fit this cage. I contacted customer services and was informed that the additional pks for this cage had been discountiued. If you think your hamspter will be happy in this cage alone then it is a nice cage but if you need( or would like to expand so your hampster can be happy and have plenty of room) This is not the cage for you! I was very dissapointed and let customer service know. I would not have bought this if I knew it could not be added onto but the box clearly shows 3 small houses that can be bought seperatly and attached with tubes. Weigh your options here and know what you are getting.
4,Great cage!,"I like the design of the cage. It is pretty big for my hamster. It is sturdy and light weight. I have a few gripes about it, though.My hamster, and even my sister's (she has the same cage) for some reason have basically moved in the wheel. I think maybe because the wheel is dark, but that is where BOTH hamster's sleep.The wheel is confusing to put together.The wheel is the only thing that I don't like. I wish my hamster would come out and not eat or poop in it."
4,Exploring the gambling psyche,"On the surface The Smart Money is an insider's look at betting money for one of the nation's most successful sports bettors. Making winning selections usually is beyond most who see sports gambling as the road to wealth and fame. This book reveals the difficulty of taking serious money out of the game once you have managed to crack the holy grail. What makes it unique, is it is told by a gifted writer who was actually on the inside.Below the surface author Michael Konik explores the mental makeup needed to endure the financial and emotional swings in big time betting. This book is must reading for anybody who envisions life as a professional gambler. The author's own personal tribulations rationalizing money to conventional work and personal relationships far out-shadows anything else written on the subject."
3,Not Bad,"Started off really good and got you excited about something big happening within the book. But it just went nowhere in the end with an abrupt ending. Not a bad read though, quick and easy."
4,Enjoyable read for sports bettors,"This was an incredibly entertaining read. If you're not interested in Las Vegas, you probably won't enjoy this. If you're into sports but not sports betting, this might bring you around. If you're a sports bettor I think you'll enjoy this read.The one thing I was missing was any specific example of how the picks were made. It's clear why Konik wasn't given access to the formulas and calculations. [...]. My respect and appreciation for what Google has accomplished is because they gave me a taste of how complex it is with PageRank. I wish this book had done the same with a single formula that would have illuminated while also not giving away the store.Overall, the book is a good time. Check it out."
5,This book will not teach you how to make wagers... This book book will teach you how to think about wagering.,"Another bang on winner! I think Smart Money in particular is a perfect follow up to a book I read a couple of yearsago called ""The Odds: One Season, Three Gamblers and the Death of Their Las Vegas"", by Chad Millman. Totally different style obviously Millman has, and obviously written from a mostly superficial, biographical point of view.Both books do a fine job in understanding the industry in a way no one else has ever done. The major differencein Konik's book though is taking the better/bookie relationship to such an entertainingly sophisticated level. It's almost like he writes with a direct probe to his characters minds, thoughts and consciousness.This book is an absolute must for fans of Sports Wagering."
5,gambling epic,"Great read, and I should know, I wrote 602 Reasons to be Ticked Off, another epic work. Michael Konik's book is an unbelievable story of an undercover life he led for over three years, you will wish you were there with him as you turn the pages. It's a page turner, similar to House of Cards. This book should and probably will be a movie, I highly recommend it. Even if you know nothing about gambling, trust me you will love it. Incredible insight into the world of gambling, turns out the casinos aren't all they say they are.PS I think I read somewhere that if you don't read this book, there is a very good chance you could be bumped off."
5,Unputdownable,Michael Konik has shared with the sports betting world what it wants to know -- how to beat the books long term. This unputdownable book takes you through the emotional and financial roller coaster that is sports betting. Konik does a masterful job of sharing his personal emotions with his newfound professional life. Konik's intelligence and savvy are only surpassed by his writing ability. A must read for all sports bettors and those who wish they were.
2,Tiresome Narrative,"Though I found Konik's insider knowledge of the business fascinating, I never felt he knew much about the characters that inhabit the business. Therefore, Konik turns himself into the main character and, truth be told, he's just not that interesting. Half way through the book, I tired of him and his hot girlfriend and their threesomes. Now that I think about it, there was no substance to any of the personal relationships in the book.Smart Money loses momentum quite quickly. The beginning packs a punch, then it's over. I also found the book to be terribly repetitive. Every few pages I found myself thinking, ""didn't he just say that?"" In the end, it was the repetitiveness that took me out of the narrative altogether. I finished the book only because I was bored during a layover in Dallas."
5,SENSATIONAL BOOK,"Michael Konik has done it again! Having read and enjoyed his previous books, I anxiously delved into The Smart Money, and was not disappointed. This man is a superb writer, a story teller extraordinaire!Mr. Konik has written an intriguing story. Although I am not a gambler, I was fascinated with his account of the gambling world. Michael Konik, a beautiful writer, makes the English language sing. His writing is powerful. Hands down, he is one of the best writers I've read. I eagerly look forward to his next work."
4,If only I'd bet the house.,"A good well written tale but like all gambling tales you have to bet on what part is true and what part is a bluff. This book like _Bringing Down the House_ tends to glamorize a culture that is anything but glamorous.The notion that all you have to have is an in, a computer, a tout is spurious at best and wishful thinking at worst.People remember winners did not build all those beautiful temples of greed that you see in Las Vegas nor do winners pick up the expenses for the web sites that promote gambling dreams.Ok if you do it for the rush and you are able to pay the admission that's one thing, however, if you do it thinking you're going to be living on the beach get ready for a bad beat.Still a fun book, good style,and personal insights but remember JC is not the only think that floats."
3,"Pretty interesting, though a bit repetitive","It's been pretty well summed up by the other reviewers, but I found this to book to be very interesting (if it's mostly truthful, who knows though, he had an obvious lie/goof with saying Favre sat out a game in '99) as far as how bet running and living the Vegas high life works.However, it is also wildly repetitive. He flies to Vegas. A dude brings him a crapload of money. He gets a phone call. He goes to the sportsbook, shmoozes with the workers, and bets a ton of money. He sits around his hotel room and waits for another call. He goes back down and bets more. He goes out to eat and drink for free at the finest Vegas hotspots. Repeat this about 20 times and that's nearly two-thirds of the book right there.It would've been nice if he had actually found out more info on how the brains of the operations do their work, but it was a fairly entertaining book because it paints a picture of the life most guys would kill for."
2,Super insights into betting syndicates? Not really.,"Konik must have had a bunch of his betting buddies vote 5 stars for this book 'cause there's about as much chance of this being a 5 as he claims the 'squares' do of beating the bookies. Zip. Short version: mostly boring, 100 pages too long wasting paper and ink on stuff we couldn't care less about (his problems with his girlfriend and forever restating lines and bets) and really DOESN'T tell a lot about syndicate gambling. Just a lot of reliving wins and losses and moving money with all the credit going to computer programs. Duh. Thought it was going to be a great book but I got suckered on a crafty title. Wish I'd bet the money it cost me on the Superbowl."
1,Michael Konik is the bookie!,After being robbed of $10 I feel like Michael Konik is my bookie and I just hit a 12 game teaser and he won't give me my money back. A waste of time and I have been to all the places in the book and he does nothing to paint the picture. The real con here is that Michael Konik passes him self off as a writer.
1,"If I could give less stars, I would","Probably the worst book I have ever read in my life. Boring, poorly written and repetetive. The good reviews here are complete frauds, from either friends, family of publishers. I read the first 2/3 of this book, then came here to see if the book got any better. It clearly does not. What a piece of garbage."
3,Enjoyable read...not enough inormation,A fun look at the world of hi stakes sports betting. I would have preferred more information on WHY their system was so successful.
3,Good Book...But Should Have Been Great,"I have all of Michael Konik's Gambling ""Short Story"" Books and I am a big fan of his...This Football Betting Syndicate tale is a story I was definitely interested in....while the book has some insight into their operations there is not near enough of it...I did find the issues with the Offshore Books quite interesting since I have carried some big balances with these Operations in these ""Iffy"" countries...definitely made me more leary of doing that in the future...all in all I felt the book was about a 100 pages long and I felt all of the girlfriend stuff was unneeded filler....for the amount of pages it had ,I would have loved much more detail about the syndicate and HOW they came up with their weekly plays...still a recommended breezy read if you are a gambler but could have been so much more IMO,"
4,not what husband expected,"my husband got this book for christmas and was really looking forward to it. he enjoyed the read, however, it wasn't what he expected. it told more of the experiences of the author, not the techniques he actually used to win."
5,Family Members Found Through Native History,"This is a wonderful book that shows the true grit of the times of the early settlers and how the Native Tribes were used as pawns in the land game. The native American Tribes were an organized, peaceful Nation of people who had lived harmoniously with the land the worked. It was an unfortunate event that they were so badly displaced in their own land and thus had to create Laws and Constitutions in order for the white immigrants/settlers to understand the rights of the Natives. These Laws and Constitutions were to protect the rights of the Natives, that were left, in the only language that the white settlers were able to understand in the form of written Laws and Constitutions."
1,Needs Editing,"After reading The Path of Least Resistance, I expected more from this book. It might have great content, but it's difficult to get to it in light of all the punctuation, type-setting and grammar errors. It could use a professional editing/proofreading before it is re-issued."
5,Stellar,"Very different from their previous releases, Conversions further highlights the true skills of these two masters. Because the tracks chosen for this set are much more uptempo, it is not as accessible as the k&d sessions or, more notably, their dj kicks set. Nevertheless, the music produced in this set is just as comfortable as that on the earlier releases, despite the speed of the breaks which lay the music's foundation. Although they produce a vastly different result than mu-ziq, k&d on this set experiment with layering divergent tempos upon one another much like Paradinas does - speed underneath and softer melodies in the foreground. The result in both a surprise and a revelation: a truly mellowing jungle set with elements of jazz and ambient interspersed throughout. Likely one of the 10 best discs I own."
2,I was disappointed,"I absolutely love the K+D SESSIONS, so I bought this album hoping to have the same urban, ultra-cool listening experience. I was really disappointed. The K+D SESSIONS music is hip and smooth, and the transitions are terrific. Unfortunately, CONVERSIONS is too frenetic, too busy and fast for my enjoyment. Instead of chilling out I feel rattled and annoyed. I was not happy with this purchase."
4,Fascinating,"If you don't understand the Irish or know of Irish culture this will confusing. Having been born there, it was very easy to read and enjoyable."
5,Conscience Revisited,"This is a scholar's book. And with Jesuit scholars, the hair-splitting can become furious. I like the chapters on fundamental ethics. They get at the issues of consience and freedom that are behind the church's tough positions on human life and human love issues."
1,A Black and White Cookie....,"Here is a clear presentation of a black and white world for the rigid-minded person with great fear of ambiguity and human being. It is a beautiful system of thought, indeed. No holes. No nooks or crannies. Just an iron cage of moralizing, dressed up as scholarship, this book will provide any needy person with significant psychological boosts to her levels of cognitive rigidity, dogmatism, intolerance of any shades of gray in the world (or God's working in the world for that matter), and dependance on authority. Might appear to be sweet, like a cookie, like a black and white cookie that makes the world such a nice and orderly place....for children...or adults with arrested development. The world presented in these pages is a ""world without twilight.""My suggestion: You probably already have a Bible. Read the Gospels. Save your money and keep browsing; this tired, righteous stuff is not worth your limited time."
5,Paradigm breaking.,"Simply, the best book I've read on ""alcoholism."" After you've read the book, you'll see why I've used the quotes. Brief, but crisply written, intellectual, cogent, and penetrating, it's one of those few books that changed my way of looking at things."
5,"best bok about drinking, alcohol etc.",any adult who can readand who likes to drinkshould read this book.period
1,Would You Believe . . . .?,"A few brief words should suffice:Dr. Fingarette has never treated--never worked with--a person about whom he writes in this book. Not only that, he is a philosopher, not any sort of trained, clinical professional. He thinks, therefore he decides. Based on what?His other works are on Confucius, death, and . . . well, you get the idea."
4,A Man Walks Down the Street...,"No matter what the subject is, most people scream and run the other direction when they hear the word ""documentary"", but this is an insightful, personal look at the creative process that created one of the American music industry's most successful albums.Paul Simon and his musical cohorts offer personal stories, recording footage, and a history of not only of the album, but the circumstances--both private and international--that influenced the birth of the concept.The only drawback to this collection is that one never sees a video from start to finish; and that--or a complete song performed live--would have been nice."
1,Where's the beef?,"I love DVDs with extra material on them, but they all need to start with the basics - the thing you bought it for. In this case, that's the music and videos of it. There isn't a single song which plays all the way through, nor do most of them even last long enough to be interesting. This should have been titled ""the making of Graceland"". I love Paul Simon and can't wait until the real ""Graceland"" comes out - this DVD is a waste of time and money."
5,"""Every generation throws a hero up the pop charts""","Ever wonder what goes through the mind of a musical genius? Wonder no more,my friend. Sit at the console with Paul Simon and/or some of his Graceland pals and watch him work. Great insights."
3,Graceland Concert,Still good but a far cry from the original live concert on Video.The DVD lacks the apparent african background of the former.
1,The Graceland Interviews,Paul Simon is the musical genius of my generation. This is not a presentation of his music or Graceland. It is a series of interviews. Interesting but not entertaining. Why haven't they put The Concert in Central Park on DVD ?
1,nortongaming,"My copy of Graceland would not play on any of my DVD players or on CD players. I have to assume it was an illegal product; that my players cannot accept. I still want the concert performance, but I want a legal copy.Steve Norton"
1,GRACELAND,I HAVE YET TO RECEIVE IT! I HAVE YET TO RECEIVE IT! I HAVE YET TO RECEIVE IT! I HAVE YET TO RECEIVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!
4,classsic albums,"a great in depth view into the makings of a great album, showing how music can help bridge divides and spawn inspiration. an interesting cross selection of interview with friends, musicians and producer. would recommend if you loved the album, if your looking for a new directions with you sound, or your interested in music and human relations."
4,The making of a legendary album,"A splendid BBC-VH1 (a.o.) co-production on the making of Graceland, the album that brought Simon back to the spotlights. It tells the story, with lots of interviews and bits and pieces from videoclips, concerts and tv-performances.The picture quality is fair on average, the concertfootage (Africa concert) isn't too good, but the videoclips are fair and the interviews and stuff are just good. None of those state-of-the-art DVD-features here.Highlights for me, as a die-hard fan, are the parts where Paul Simon sits in the studio with the master tape and analyses his own songs (""This is the best I ever wrote. It's all there"").Well, as it *is* my first DVD, so I don't have much comparison material. All I can say is: if you're a fan, this DVD belongs in your collection."
3,Not Enough Recording,"The Graceland DVD is very educational and well done as far as learning about how the album was made and the complexities involved. However, it was short on actual recordings from the album being played or performed. It was 80% talk 20% music. I would have expected the reverse to be the case. So, if you expect to hear the music of the album, don't buy this DVD."
2,paul simon,this video wasnt what i thought it was. i was looking for the complete show hope to buy the other one at a later date
5,a magical performance,"This Beethoven disc features the Hanover Band playing on period instruments with less musicians than the average orchestra. This was recorded in a spacious, atmospheric acoustic approximating were Beethoven would have premiered this breathtaking work. The result is thoroughly enjoyable and still sounds great after repeated listenings, just a great Eroica, with a magical quality that's hard to beat; I found it to be something quite special. This also makes a good second version if you already have a modern interpretation."
2,Reference manual,"This book contains a collection of reference material about MIDI. It covers the MIDI specification, MIDI hardware, instruments, sequencing, digital audio in MIDI production, synchronization, and mixing. I'm no expert on MIDI, and I can't say that I really developed my understanding of MIDI by reading this book. Much of the prose I found rather obtuse, such as the following definition of multimedia: ""Basically, multimedia is nothing more than a unified programming and operating system (OS) environment that lets multiple forms of program data and playback media coexist and be routed directly to the appropriate hardware device for output, playback, and/or processing."" Perhaps someone who knows more about MIDI would find this book useful, but it's definitely not intended as an introductory book for novices. On the other hand, I get the feeling from the brevity of the book that it might not contain enough depth of detail to satisfy experts either."
5,Everything it Promises to Be!,"This book delivers everything it promises to deliver. It is easy to read for both the student and the beginner, yet comprehensive enough to be of great value to the experienced MIDI user and educator. The illustrations, while not professionally-rendered at times (some are jagged, bit-mapped images), are very clear and helpful.The book gives a clear, concise, and easily-understood description of how binary code is used to control MIDI devices. In addition, it serves as a good introduction to digital audio and multi-media.Included in the appendices are the MIDI 1.0 Specification and the MIDI Implementation Chart."
2,eh,"Too broad, irrelevant information, many mistakes (ex: ""patch chords""), too conversational (i prefer a more professional text book style, high informational density). This book is not worth the cost."
3,A Tribute To Depeche Mode????,"I haven't listened many of these bands before but apparently they all make smiliar sounds. Though they cover all DM songs extremley different from the originals they use the same way. I mean it's like the band doesn't change but the singers take their turns. On the other hand, I think Depeche Mode is not a sort of band for such an album. Because their style is unique and if you touch it will immediately lose its spirit. So don't expect something marvelous, great or wicked. Yet it's worth listening."
4,LOVETHIEVES,"I heard this cd a long time ago when I was a young one ( i am still young, but YOUNGER). It all started with this cd, and how i came to like DM. My favorite song was ""sun and the rainfall"" in both this cd and even better in ""A BROKEN FRAME"".It is just probably me that likes this cd. Well i don't know maybe if i buy it or something i would probably change my mind...PROBABLY. It all comes down to this all DM songs are great. even if they are quiet long like non stop mixes,At least you have something to mellow out with."
3,Trance Mode,"I have heard the ablem a few times,i think this needs alittle more work into it..a few tracks like ""The Sun And The RainFall"" by ""Element"" was a very great track for the cd,a real gothic tech club song,but if you are not a techno fan i wouldnt look into this cd..."
2,hit rock bottom with this...............,"Unless you love techno,this cd is not for you.I found it just very boring.THERE'S NOT EVEN ANY SINGING IN IT....Sure some of the melodies and beats are good like the ""waiting for the night"" remixes....But this is not good buy.Unless like I said before,a true fan of DM or a techno fan.The only one on here that I enjoy listenin' to is the cover of ""Just can't get enough""......"
4,Gets better every time I watch it,"Mutual Appreciation is not as good as Funny Ha Ha, IMO, but it's still one of the most memorable indie films made that year. My favorite sequence is the main character's live performance. That was shot so well. And on film no less. There is a lot young filmmakers can learn about verite technique by watching this movie. It gets better every time I watch it."
5,YUP... I'm immature,"Yes, I still play with ""dolly's"" occasionally, lol. This is a cute set up though. Love that it comes with debbie's biological clock... and several booze bottles among other things. You have to do a little bit of rigging if you set these up in a display as the platic things that hold them in standing position are not set up to balance well. Other than that- I have enjoyed these."
3,No Toe Room,"I would give these shoes a 5 except that there isn't enough toe room. I bought the version with laces in 10 1/2. I've been wearing New Balance shoes size 10 1/2 for the last 3+ years (2-3 pairs) and they always fit perfectly before this, so I don't know what's going on with this shoe. I find that my toes are constantly pressing against the end of the shoe whether sitting or standing. I also agree with one of the other reviewers that the soles are a little hard and stiff, although I haven't found that to cause any comfort problems. After this experience I will probably get my next pair of New Balance shoes in the store so I can try them on first, since apparently their construction is not consistent across different shoe lines."
4,work favorite,"I like this style new balance sneaker for work because it has a flat sole.I don't like sneakers with a lot of grooves in the sole,plus i'm on my feet most of the day and these are comfortable."
4,sneakers,"They are good sneakers and I usually get this brand, my laces never stay tied. They are nylon I think. If you could deal with that it is a great purchase"
2,Velcro or not Velcro,Ordered the Velcro New Balance shoes. Upon arrival they were not velcro at all. Just shoe laces. What a disappointment! There seems to be a general lack of truth in advertising these days.
2,Sent the wrong shoe size,"I live overseas and when I have a planned trip or my husband's colleague goes to the US for a business trip I would order stuffs online. I ordered a size 7 shoes and what was deliverd was a size 6.5. I have no way of returning or exchanging it since I do not know when I will be back in the US.Otherwise the shoes looked good, durable and a good price."
2,Well built and extremely uncomfortable.,These shoes appear to be very well built however there is no cushion in the heel area of the shoe. Walking in them is very uncomfortable.
2,The sizes run small.,I sent these shoes back and was charged a restock charge. I ordered a men's size 12 which I've ordered on line for Reebok and Sketchers as well as slippers and never had any problem. These ran small and were too tight.
2,A shoe without a sole?,"I walk and hike a lot & New Balance shoes are consistently the best I've found. (They used to be very wide, but now they have a more normal fit.) Like all New Balance shoes, these are extremely well constructed, with excellent stability & support. But these particular shoes have virtually no tread at all, and what little they have will wear down quickly & become slick & unsafe. I've seen this lack of tread on other New Balance shoes as well & I can't understand why they do this. These shoes are a nasty fall waiting to happen. Most New Balance shoes have good deep tread and provide great traction. Those are the ones I buy."
5,New Balance is the Bomb!,"It amazes me that so many people leave bad reviews based on customer service or in this case, cause you ordered a shoe too small so it is uncomfortable. These reviews are for the product themselves, not your own stupidity or complaints against the seller. I personally use amazon to review products whether I am buying them from Amazon or not for the reviews and when you write a bad review on something other that your satisfaction with the products, it doesn't give the review a True rating.I'm a 350 lb man and these shoes are very comfortable for me and I have had them for about 6 months and they're still all intact. I would recommended any brand of New Balance."
5,Pleased,"Substantial, supportive, comfortable; they feel reassuring. They may run just a touch small by size. I've had them just a few weeks and they seem to keep my feet warm in the cold winter weather."
4,Comfort at a great price,Took only a day to break these in though they do still squeak a bit even after a week. Haven't taken them on any long stretches yet so time will tell on just how comfortable these turn out to be in the long run. So far they appear to be quite comfortable. Can't beat the price either. The styling could be a bit more streamlined and less clunky-looking around the toe -- though I guess that's the style with most walking shoes. The extra wide size is nice for more comfort and wiggle room.
5,The pony pals are trying to help an old pony,It was a great book! I like all pony pal books! Pam and Lightning find an old pony. The owners of that pony don't take care of her properly. The Pony Pals want to find out about the pony's owners and why they don't take care of her. They are thinking of a plan to help the pony.
3,Great book!,"This is really a great book, as the three girls secretly care for a sad,run down pony. The owners think they are trying to steal the pony, Ginger, but they just want to help. They write a note to the owners, and find out about them. They want to help them, too. But the owners don't want to helped, they want to stay at the farmhouse, not to be moved to a nursing home. What can the Pony Pals do?"
3,"Covers main topics regarding WAS, VAJ and Studio","As a recomended ressource for gaining the WebSphere Application Server (WAS) Standard Edition certification at IBM, this book is ok. Allthough one might expect IBM to upgrade it very soon to the latest editions of their software, it is still usefull as it covers the way Visual Age and WebSphere Studio is brought to play with WebSphere Application Server. Don't expect miracles though"
4,Priceless Tutorials - Valuable Information,"This redbook gives a thorough overview of the software products required to build an entire Websphere based web solution. This includes Websphere App Server, Websphere Studio, Visual Age for Java, DB2, and SecureWay. It gives numerous detailed examples taking you through servlets, JSPs, and interactive web sites. Towards the end it introduces the Patterns Development Kit. (This topic is covered in detail in redbook SG24-5864-00.) This gives sample architecture and a strategy for selecting the one for a given application given its needs. It provides a good sized application with full source code and explanation showing you a best practices for building sites in this environment. The only drawback is that it could use an update for today's more recent versions of the software. Despite that, the installation instructions and sample code are easy to install and follow. It's a permanent part of my library."
3,This is superbly black pine tar,"This pine tar comes in an attractive and functional metal tin. The tar itself is a very dark brown colour, and is of a excellent consistency, being thick enough to not run, but thin enough to spread with ease. The scent of this pine tar was different from that which I am used to in the marine industry, but nonetheless I hope it will perform similarly. I was very impressed with the tarriness of this tar, although I was throughly distrubed by the obnoxiously clingy packing peanuts, and spent a great length of time trapping them with their box. After I finally managed to subdue them, I taped the box up tight and hid it under the couch where it lies to this day. A product packaged in crumpled newspaper would be throughly more enjoyable to unpackage, and would would also allow for much easier recycling of the packing material."
4,[NoMotiv],An excellent cd. Can be listened to over and over again. Never gets old or boring. Definitely buy it if you've only heard one song cuz they all rock.
2,bogart's mxpx,"I also saw these guys LIVE with mxpx, but wasn't all that impressed. Their bass player had good stage presence. However, there songs were kinda boring. There was a cool band that opened up the show called Too Bad Eugene and they were cool as a lang hole. mxpx took the show."
2,obviously written by a feminist!,"And I am a feminist (so, I can be critical!) Marge Piercy's books are too pat. The women are all serious and dedicated, the men are all bad, and no one has a sense of humor. She makes her point, albiet in a very preachy manner. Her best books consist of her vision of the future. Read the book, He, She and It for her best."
3,They're kind of short,I wouldn't buy these for shoes with more than four pairs of eyelets. There wasn't much left to tie a knot with in my loafers with five pairs.
3,Ok but short,"Ok quality laces. For my size 11 dress shoes, these laces are a little too short though. I should have ordered longer ones."
1,"Awful, stay away.","These shoelaces do not stay tied (have to double not each time), and yet when I try to untie them, they frequently catch on themselves and get into ridiculous knots that require me to take the shoe off before solving. DO NOT BUY. Get real shoelaces from a shoe repair shop."
4,As described -- works well,As described -- works wellthe negative is the tit is a little stiff and gets undone more frequently than other show laces I have bought in the past
5,A must read for evangelicals,"For anyone who wants to know more about the call of Christ, this book is a must read. Shane Clayborne puts you in a position where either you begin to see scripture in a new light and devour the book, or you cling to the status quo views of what society says Christianity should be and put the book down. He exposes a great deal of truths about scripture that for some people in the faith, would be considered too radical. If you make it to the end, it hits you that Christ was socially radical by today's standards and you find yourself facing a decision; Am I going to put feet to my faith or just settle for ""believing the right stuff?"" Then again like Shane points out, even the devil believes in God! This book is a true call to action and is a great read for teenagers wondering about what faith really means.Super Christmas gift."
5,SO AWESOME!!!,"this is one of the coolest books I have ever read and it changed my life, and I'm not even done reading it yet. It a quick read and it so wonderful, I would recommend it to any and every one!!"
3,Ordinary in many ways,"Shane Claiborne has written a very readable book about his image of Christianity. Unforunately, his Christianity, like that which is on the far right, is overly simplified. As he descibes his life you realize that much of what he does he does to make himself feel better, little has a truly long lasting effect on those whom he contacts."
1,First book I could NOT finish.....Same old subject chapter after chapter,"The book starts out ok, and makes you want to get up and help the world out. But how many of us can really go and live on the streets? I did not like how he disregards and is negative aboout political leaders and leaders in general. God put these leaders in place for a reason and according to the Bible was should be obedient to the leaders placed above us. It doesn't mean we have to like everything, but we don't need to bash them. Shane is too much on ""God is love"" and not enough on ""we need God because we are sinners""."
4,This book made me want to puke...,"...because this guy hits the nail on the head so hard, it hurts. My eyes were opened and my heart challenged deeply by this book. While I am still digesting some of his thoughts, Shane has changed my mind on a few things. I read A LOT, and this is the first book in a while that I spent more than a week on. The chapters stung so deep that I had to catch my breath, challenge my worldview, seek God's perspective, talk with friends and family, and finally make a decision on what I believed. Needless to say, this is not a light book, approach it with caution.pssstt...I think he'd right, make Jesus the ONLY thing...and the world has no hope of avoiding God."
5,Brilliant Book,Without a Doubt this is the 2nd best book I have ever read(You cannot beat the bible)This book has changed my life
2,needed it for a class,"Unrealistic. Read it because I had to. Not crazy about the author, not buying into his revolution...and to me it IS resistible."
2,Arrogant,"I was highly looking forward to reading this book. I was told it was absolutely ""Life-changing"" from several of my respected colleagues. I was quite disappointed.It is high-minded theorizing from an obviously spoiled rich kid. Shane tries to be ""cool"" by hanging out with the poor, but ultimately, he is only fooling himself.Someone who is truly poor would not have the opportunities that he has been afforded (meeting Mother Theresa in Calcutta - who could afford that trip?).Yup, he lives among the poor - in between trips to Hawaii and other fantastic locations to spread his ""gospel"".Give me a break."
4,Shane Claiborne's Manifesto,"Love him or hate him, you can't say that Shane Claiborne doesn't make you think. In ""The Irresistible Revolution,"" Claiborne challenges the Church to think differently about poverty, materialism, and love. Part memoir, part manifesto, the book follows Claiborne from his Tennessee childhood to working with Mother Teresa to starting the Simple Way in Philadelphia. While I don't agree with all of his statements (a few times he considers ""military intelligence"" to be an oxymoron), Claiborne has definitely inspired me to think differently about how I can help make the world a better place."
5,Highly Recommend!,Great book on how we have made the church into what we want instead of what Christ wants. Fantastic insight and certainly the author has a heart for Christ and thus a love for others. Even if you don't agree with all the authors opinions you cannot miss his sincerity. This book convicts the heart and places the burden on the reader to establish a change in their life.Highly recommend!
4,A book to rock your world,"Shane Claiborne presents a fascinating, semi-autobiographical story which is bound to challenge you as you read it. Even if you do not end up at the same point as him (I'm not sure I quite reached it), you will definitely not be the same person after reading this book. If you call yourself a Christian, then this book will challenge your theology and the outworking of your faith. If you don't then maybe this book will encourage you to reconsider that choice after you are presented with an alternative take on the Christian faith."
2,The Irresistible Revolution: Living as an Ordinary Radical,"This guy is no ""ordinary radical."" He is the definition of radical. He starts off with some solid, good stuff, but then goes off of the deep end. I only recommend you read this if you know what you believe, and aren't easily swayed by stuff just because it sounds ""good"" or ""righteous."" Borrow a copy if you want to read it. Otherwise, if you are like me, you will be kicking yourself for spending money that will forward his cause."
3,The Irresistible Revolution,"This book gave me a really interesting perspective on the faith. Some opinions of Claiborne's I disagreed with, as I would any other person. Worth reading whether you're Christian, Muslim, Hindu, Jewish or anything in between. Just be sure to keep an open mind, something will surely touch you."
3,Challenging,"I am leading a small group through this book.It challenges comfortable Christianity and inspires me to go to the broken and tender places of the world.On the negative side, there is some crass language that while not obscene could keep those who need to hear what he is saying from giving it a read.It is clear that he has some scars from his earlier life/church experiences and these spill out every now and then in passing comments."
5,Irresistible Revolution,"Has refreshing, humble, challenging perspective which takes Christianity back to what it should be all about. Could not put it down. And now buying copies for others."
4,Will it be a REVOLUTION that lasts? I hope so!,"If younger Christians truly take this book seriously, I'm sure Shane and others like him will bring about a revolution not at all unlike Martin Luther's. Since I'm 82 yrs old, I won't be here to see like-minded believers actually living their faith by the thousands ++++so that others will eagerly ""want it"". Of course this means I believe it will bring about an evangelism explosion like no other and the masses will embrace it ""wildly"" at first. I've been a consciencious student of God's Word through four generations, not at all unwilling to accept good change - have seen a lot of good change and some that's not. I am only certain that God the Father, Son and Holy Spirit will allow only what gives Him glory to survive the tests of time."
5,"Thank you, Jesus!","Incredible book. Moves you to action. This book IS radical. Do not read it if you want to feel good about your pleasant, happy life. Read it if you know that there must be something more to following Jesus.It is about love. Love God, love your neighbor.Love is a verb.If you want more, then this is a book for you. It is written in a younger, more contemporary style, sure, but that doesn't take away from the message.Finished it and turned around to reread it."
4,pushing the edge,"I really enjoyed this book. Looking for a new way to live out my faith as a Christian, I was/am challenged by the way the the author chooses to live life and pour into others. I dont think I could follow in his tracks, but it makes me strive to be more radical (in a good way) in my everyday life. Shane is a good author and makes his stories and his words easy to understand."
5,What a Radical!,"Excellent book. Just excellent. Do I agree with everything? No, but boy does it make you think. Shane did a great job!Bob V"
1,some good points but...,"it comes across at times very arrogant and very judgmental. I am in no way a rich and even less so a powerful person but I do have a very huge problem with those who condemn and judge those who are en masse. Jesus himself had his share of well to do friends. He just didn't come for the poor, he came for all. That UNIVERSAL message seems to be really missing from so many of these like minded books.Also I realize the author is very young, hopefully in time, he'll learn the importance of humility."
2,Don't waste your time,"First of all, I bought this book only because it was required reading for one of my classes. Second of all, if I had known what I know now after reading it, I would have just dropped the course. Claiborne really just has this diction that is not appealing in the slightest. He tries to use hip language to appeal to young adults, but it ends up sounding cheesy and forced. I hate to be rude, but this book was just not worth the money at all."
5,Unique,"In high school we took a lot of geography, and learned about ""tombolos"" and ""terminal moraines"" and such, but damned if the teacher ever gave you an example.This book has an interesting approach - it shows a map on one side, the text points out interesting or unusually features, and then a second page with diagram and text explains the origin of the feature.It seems like a simple idea, but it's an approach I've seen in few other places.Some negatives:This is a re-print of a fairly old book, so perhaps (according to the new forword) some of the theory is a little old. I feel however, the bulk of the material is still valid, and well worth it. (It's too bad some aspiring professor somewhere does write an up-to-date book using the same approach)The new forword doesn't add much to the book, and the publisher might better have left it out."
5,this book changed my life!,"i know, sounds silly, but i picked up an old hardback of armin k. lobeck's masterpiece from a street ""vendor"" in new york about 15 years ago. paid 25c for it. it has influenced my perception of maps, geology, and the histories of the earth, life, and civilization ever since. it's a simple book, really, but full of concepts and ideas that you just don't get anywhere else here in the 21st century. also, the (hand drawn) illustration is unusually enlightening while exhibiting a charm and elegance that is lost on graphic designers these days.the only reason anyone would ever go to the trouble of producing a document like this is because they were truly passionate about the ideas they were presenting. it's very sincere, and you'll never look at maps (or the world) the same way again."
3,Just wondering...,"I've actually not bought these yet. They look like the best choice for reusable straws, but I'm wondering if the polycarbonate material has BPA in it... Does anyone know?Thanks!"
2,Fatal Flaw,"These straws are ALMOST perfect. I love them from a functional standpoint - they hold up well, wash up beautifully (w/o falling through the holes in my dishwasher's utensil basket), and end the money and trash out w/ disposable straws.BUT . . . they contain BPA (I contacted Zak, the manufacturer, and they confirmed it). It's just not worth risking my children's health over. I'll consider stainless steel, but I'm not sure they'll like the feel/cold of those."
4,Zak Designs Reusable Straws,"I love to drink beverages through a straw, but was feeling guilty about all that disposable plastic. Now I have reusable straws with a fun retro design that are easy to clean."
3,Price Saver At Best,Love the design and the idea you can wash and reuse. My only concern is that it does not work on frozen drinks. I made a slushy with lemonade and you could not sip through this straw. These straws should have been made wider! I had to resort back to the plastic straws I had on hand and had not problem.
5,Polycarbonate straws.,"These are great. Use all the time, easy to wash and never squashed or broken. Works for me..."
3,"Nice story, if you skip the preachy sections","I enjoyed reading Adrienne Hall's story about thru-hiking the AT, especially because so few women complete such a journey. I began by reading every word she wrote, but about halfway through the book got so depressed at her scientific reality checks about salamanders, wolves, bald mountains, and all the many wild things threatened by human encroachment, pollution, etc., that I began to skip these sections (there's only so much guilt you can feel and continue with your everyday existence) to find out if they made it all the way to Katahdin. Wish there were more details of her current life and how the trail changed her, but it doesn't detract from the story to leave these facts to the imagination. A good read, especially for AT afficionados, but don't expect miracles beyond two people walking 2,135 miles through wilderness without killing each other. Which, in and of itself, is pretty miraculous."
4,A Good AT Book,"Adrienne's narrative of life on the AT is often repetitive of tales from other AT accounts, but I always find something different and refreshing from someone else's telling of them. Taken into the family of AT literature it can offer another perspective and another take of life on the AT. Her descriptions of what the hike did to her emotionally and the inner growth she experiences and her love for her boyfriend was a refreshing take. This is also an excellent account of a woman's experience of the AT, which I had never read a narrative of. Adreinne also offers a refreshing perspective of resource management, and I found her opinions on land use and how the for-proftis have their eyes set on the outdoors and our wallets a good lesson."
3,From a female thru-hiker,"I recently read this book because I thru-hiked the Appalachian Trail in 1999. I wanted to see another woman's point of view on the journey. I found myself identifying with her often, but a lot of other stuff got in the way of the actual description of what it's like to be out there on the trail. Yet, as there are very few backpacking oriented books for women this would be a good read for someone preparing to thru hike. For more backpacking advice geared towards women, check out Beverly Hugo's book on women thru hikers, as well as Adrienne's other book ""Backpacking: A Ragged Mountain Press Woman's Guide""."
2,"Bad writing, your time better spent elsewhere.","Got this book ""free"" when going the Appalachian Mountain Club (AMC) and I'm interested in the subject matter (hiking the AT), so I read it. Unfortunately, the majority of it I found to be self-indulgent, preachy, amateurish pap. Insipid pabulum. Passage after passage sure to make you wince if not heave. Okay, maybe that's a little harsh and to be fair there was _some_ good info on the history of the trail, but the ratio is something like 80% crap to 20% good stuff. Not worth it. Doesn't have the humor of Bill Bryson or the maturity and authority of John McPhee."
2,Where's the story about hiking the trail?,"I chose this book thinking that I would be reading the story of the author's hike through the Appalachian Trail. Instead, she would write a few paragraphs about her experience, then go off on a completely different subject, opining her liberal views on the national park system, reintroduction of wildlife, Indian mythology, blah, blah, blah. After the first 100 pages, I started skipping pages at a time just to get back to what I assumed was the point of her story--the trail hike. She and her boyfriend seemed quite likable--but you never got a real feel of how this affected them. Even the epilogue was vague. Where is she living? What is her occupation? Did they ever marry? Yeah, they ate granola then junk food, but how did this affect the rest of her life (as she continued to claim that it would)?"
1,Diary of a narrow-minded and dependent hiker,"This woman did no planning and barely participated in the hike. She gives a lengthy account of a ""left plenty of trace"" AT hike loaded with tedious editorial opinions. Do yourself a favor and forego this book in favor of Jean Deeds ""There Are Mountains To Climb""."
2,Not as expected,"I bought this book because I expected a strong female voice about thru hiking. Adrienne whines through most of the trip, always complaining about something. Before I hiked on the Appalachian Trail, I read most everything that I could find about the subject. Thankfully this book was not available at that time, because reading her accounts may have encouraged me not to proceed with the hike. I would suggest the Bryson book (A Walk in the Woods), it brings humor to the subject and maybe Adrienne would have had a better time with a little sense of humor."
2,Not what I was hoping for,"Most of the book reads like a term paper. There are precious few details about the day to day experiences and nature encountered. I had the feeling throughout that Ms. Hall would rather have been somewhere else, and I found it too personal at times- just not what I was looking for."
3,"Good writing, not as good story-telling","The author skillfully weaves between accounts of trail experiences and descriptions of the trail's history, preservation issues and features of the environment. I got this book from the library hoping to read an account of what it is like to hike the trail, so I somewhat enjoyed the very few descriptions of actual trail life. Still, these portions were not as well written as the more ""factual"" informative sections, and were really outnumbered, and so I found it all pretty dry and her trip fairly uninteresting.My recommendation for a good travel book is ""Homelands..."" by Byron Ricks. It's about kayaking and you feel like you're there."
3,Expected more than this....,"I bought this book expecting a strong female voice on hiking the AT. What I read was a girl whose main reason for hiking was because she knew her boyfriend wouldn't consider marrying anyone who wouldn't hike the trail with him....Hello? Some of her observations were interesting, but she also spends most of the book ranting about something."
1,What is this ...?,"I have put up with many games long enough to beat them. I put up with Pikmin for god's sake. This game starts out great. You get to create your character from a choice of many sweet looking aliens. I thought to myself ""wow, this should be a cool game."" Was I wrong. AI is horrible. At times I wanted to fire a giant laser into my own team. Knock some sense into them by eliminating a few of their friends. But this didn't work. This game is so bad, I only played an hour, in which all I did was create characters. pPretty pathetic, yes? I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone."
1,Do not buy! Stay away!,"What a complete waste of time and money. Even with the patch applied, this game is terrible. It's boring, the AI stinks, the graphics are terrible, and the fun parts of the game have been abstracted (particularly the space combat) while the boring parts of the game, including economic management, have been expanded on. It makes no sense. It's as though they were intentionally trying to make the game boring and dull. If I was on the design team for this game, I'd be ashamed.One and a half stars. That speaks for itself. Do not buy this game."
1,a waste of time and money,"...P>The interface is desperatly slow and dumb, you'll find lots of bugs, and since you can't focus on everything, whenever you come near the end of the game, basically you don't control anything anymore...so where is the fun of being in charge if your role is reduced to clicking the ""next turn"" button ?<P... My advice : stay clear, even if the game is given for free."
1,"Master of Orion 3 (or why, oh why, did I waste my money?)","I enjoyed Master of Orion and Master of Orion 2. My dislike of MOO 3 is equalled only by my dislike for prune pudding served on ultra bran wafers and topped with an alphalfa derivative syrup. The interface is extremely poor, the graphics were dated when MOO II was new and the enjoyment level doesn't even register. Bottom line don't buy this game. If you really think you want to try it out do a friend a favor and borrow their copy ... and then keep it. Your friend will thank you."
5,Beautiful Sheer by Estee Lauder,"This is a lighter version of ""Beautiful"" by Estee Lauder that does not have a heavy scent. It is a fresh, light scent that lasts throughout the day. Estee Lauder scents may be a little on the expensive side for some, but I find it to be worth the money as I appreciate a light scent that lingers but is not too heavy or overwhelming to those around you."
4,The Greatest of These is Love,This used book was as good as described. The binding is good and there is no underlining or torn pages. Good condition for a classic book. Thanks!
3,Napoleon Dynamite Pink T-shirt,The T-shirt is very cute--love the color--however it is a bit thin and must be layered to avoid see-through. Overall I'm pleased.
3,"Impressive, but not a masterpiece","""European Air War"" is one of the most fun games I have ever played. As a history buff, I had a great time fighting in World War II. Unfortunately, I can no longer play it since we got a new computer. The game is compatible with 8-bit graphics, and newer video cards cannot support 8-bit. That's the reason why I have to give it just 3 stars, but if I was still able to play it then I would definitely give it five."
1,unworkable mess,The eaw is simply not worth the effort to buy it wont work with xp and needs a ton of ram so you need an older system with high ram none of the games b-17 or the eaw seem to be worth even purchasing
4,A must-read!,"Herb Plambeck does it again! This facinating tale of one man's date with destiny is filled with more plot twists than the Watergate scandal. From the explosive first chapter to the climactic duel with the rabid mountain goat, the book is impossible to put down."
2,Abandoned wife is a caricature,"Laura Stockdale's only role in the story is to be narrow, stodgy and unlikable, while every other member of her family does nothing but admire the mistress, who is smart, honest, attractive, real, young, courageous, stylish, successful...Trollope never seems to give the first wives much slack."
2,I was dissapointed,This was beautifly written but it made me feel so depressed it seemed that most all of the characters really loved and respected th father who cheated on his wife and no one had any good feelings toward the wife who I felt really was mistreated by her husband sons and her own granddaughter the wife lost everything and she was so hurt she really needed someone to love her and hold her. I didnot like the mistress or the daughter in law carrie. I wanted the book to be about hope for everyone.
3,HO-HUM,"Marrying the Mistress was a disappointing read. Trollope gives family life good detail, but neglects to portray any sympathetic characters. Guy Stockdale is the adulterer leaving his wife of many years for a younger woman. Well, after reading about Laura, his wife, we certainly don't blame him! Laura, the long suffering wife, is totally without any redeeming qualities. Guy is just wishy-washy and Merrion, the mistress, is unlikeable. Guy deceives his wife for 7 years, then leaves her--finally--to marry his mistress. The couple, however, can't seem to get past his family obligations, and in the end, make the most bizarre decision. I just wanted to shake everybody and say, 'grow up!' There are some nice passages about Guy's daughter in law and their children, but, alas, not enough for me to say I truly enjoyed this book."
2,"One of my favorite authors, but not my favorite book","I loved ""The Spanish Lover"" and that inspired me to read more of her books. Unfortunetly, I was disappointed in this one. Quite honestly, I didn't quite ""get"" the choice made in the end. It made the Judge appear weak. So the ending spoiled my ultimate enjoyment of the book...rather than a strong ending, this one felt as if it just trailed off."
4,Sometimes Slow,"I found this book to be a bit slow in places, I couldn't quite get into the characters until about half way through. But as always - once I finished I was really happy I'd read another one of this talented authors' books! Joanna Trollope has out done herself again...."
2,disappointing,"after enjoying ms. trollope last two books, indeed all of them , i was most disappointed by this one. Some of the characters are well drawn but to me it is poorly edited and unengaging... looking forward to the next one though !"
4,A Surprising Reaction--mine !,"If anyone had ever told me that I would read a book like this and sympathize with the mistress, I would have laughed. But this is just what happened, and I was totally surprised at my reaction. I guess this is the mark of a good writer--one who ccauses you to see something from a new and different perspective.From the minute Judge Guy Stockwell makes his stunning announcement that he is leaving Laura, his wife of 40 years to marry his long-time mistress, emotions run rampant in the Stockwell family, but not necessarily in the ways you would expect. His revelation is like a large rock dropped into a small puddle-- the ripples are huge.I think that Trolloppe is a master of character development--the characters were so well drawn and so fleshed-out. These people came to inhabit my home for several days and I came to know them quite well.I am glad I finally got around to reading this talented author."
1,"Hate the Mistress, hate Carrie even more!","I actually found myself hating Carrie, although she was clearly supposed to have all the readers sympathy. Guy is 62 and his mistress (who is also self obsessed and self righteous, just like Carrie) is 31. Guys two sons are both around 40. But we are told to believe that all this is the fault of 'evil' mother Laura. Not a believable story, both Guy and his mistress are a joke, and it is by making Laura ridiculous that the author tries to portray them as the wronged ones. No it does not wash, Laura has all my sympathy. Carrie is Guys son Simons' wife. Leave her Simon, leave her......"
2,The Artistic Anatomy of Trees,"I rated this a 2 only because it is not what I expected, I'm really not qualified to rate it's accuracy. This book is more a botanical treatise than I expected. Lots of artwork and diagrams for the person who wants to draw/paint the most accurate trees in great detail."
4,Standard classic for painters of botanical subjects,"This book may not be gorgeous, but it goes into excellent detail about the structure of tree branches, shapes, buds, fruits and leaves. Everything from the shape of branches in a windswept oak to the way the leaves and flowers are structured is covered for flowering leaf trees. Conifers are not covered. The composition of groups of trees as well as examples from artwork are here. The plates are rather hazy and old, as befits this classic work, but it still is a standard for European trees."
5,"Eye-opening, practical, and powerful","This book is terrific! It describes, simply and practically, ways people communicate, and ways to be more effective. I recognized myself and others, and learned approaches that seemed ""too easy"" to work, yet they do! deLisser describes an easy-to-use framework for communicating, that can help everyone at work and at home! My wife liked these techniques so much she started using them, also. I buy this book for everyone I know who gets a new job!"
3,Good but not great,"Peter deLisser's book mostly met my expectations, but didn't dazzle me. Some of the chapters are outstanding and the parts on ""roadblocks to communication"" and ""reponsible listening"" alone probably justify the purchase of the book, particularly at this price. Other parts of the books I found to be average."
2,These days have passed,"Read the book, but for the organizational strategies of today not thinking that there is anything groundbreaking included in the content"
5,Be your own executive coach,"Peter deLisser's book ""Be Your Own Executive Coach"" is not for executives only, it's for anyone who wants to effectively communicate whether their listening or speaking.The perfect adjunct for sales training to ensure sales people are totally invovled in the sales conversation."
3,Good but not great,Given the other reviews I was expecting more. The book covers communication techniques at a high level but fails to go into enough detail. It is a quick read and can be covered in an hour or two.
3,not so surprising,"there is some good points to known , but it is a bit long for the ideas developed inside."
3,Different strokes,"As usual I'm amazed how the same book affects different people in such polar opposite ways. Still the book was better than I thought it would be, considering how overwrought most of Cates' historical romance books are. A Horse Whisperer wanna be, Fly Away has some good moments, though some of its emotional excesses aren't so much wrenching, as they are unbelievable."
2,DROWNING,"The first book of Ms. Cates that I read was RESTLESS IS THE WIND. I was struck by the powerful emotions of this book and I looked forward to others equally as powerful. But I have discovered that there can be too much emotion -- that there is a danger of drowning in it. And that's what I felt like here. I felt manipulated by all this angst, and I found myself skipping over parts trying to come up for air. There is a certain truth to the dictum ""less is more."" Less would definitely have been more in this case. I don't think I'll be trying another."
1,Fly Away From This Book,"This is the only book I've read by Kimberly Cates and it will be the last. I was disappointed in the lack of horse content andthe barrage of emotional analysis that was unending. It seemed to me that Ms. Cates had no faith in my ability to make inferences or draw conclusions when it came to the characters.She wrote repetitively and tediously about feelings and motives, yet her descriptions of the Irish countryside and other scenes were very weak. I've been to Ireland to ride horses and it really is quite magical. This book isn't."
1,"MIT, listen to me.",Reprint this book.Books on this subject are rare. There are a lot of books about gears but not many about the machines. And this book is rare. Look at the price they are asking for used ones. And it isn't even an old book.
2,Poor quality illustrations,I read Val's review and would not recommend a photo copy of this book if one requires quality pictures. The illustrations of the gear cutting machines are far too small and muddy to pick up some idea of construction. I can only give this book only 2 stars for a reasonable amateur effort. I do own a copy.
2,"Very casually written, but disappointing for me.","Although the book is written in a very casual, fun style, I found this book boring and disappointing. No illustrations."
4,A very clear and useful introduction to data modelling,"This book is an excellent introduction to the subject of data modelling. Although it is a brief book, it covers thoroughly all of the relevant issues of data modelling, including subtypes and arcs, and gives useful hints on how to gather the information necessary for developing a data model during the analysis phase of a project. It has three more bonuses: a section describing common mistakes on models, some assorted models of frequently used patterns (organization hierarchies, bill of materials, etc) and an appendix describing how to convert the conceptual model to SQL statements. This is the only book you need to learn data modelling."
2,Entity Relationship Modelling considered Harmful,"Prospective buyers should be aware ERM is a mistake. It is a vastly oversimplification of actually modelling, being incapable of representing many fundamental features of any relational model and even being misleading.ER diagrams OTOH are nice for drafting and presentation purposes. Just don't confuse them with a real model."
3,Nice Read,I enjoyed this book but it is not as good as her other writings I have read. I was anxious to see who it was!
1,No No No,"I figured this is what I would find in the reviews and most are negative. This does not pass as a romance and certainly not as mystery. I guess you could catagorize it as what's today's menu and how are the too cute dogs. We all know by now that Fern features dogs in all her stories,she lives with 5 of her own. Too bad the dogs can't read, they might enjoy her silly stories. Pass on this one"
5,Light and Easy,"I enjoyed this book I thought it was light and easy to read. I enjoyed Cooper, Sadie, and Lulu (?) I think if it were not for their little antics this book would have been rather dull"
4,My first Fern Michaels - good read,I had never read Fern Michaels before and I thought this was a very well written book that I just couldn't put down. I literally read it in a weekend because I couldn't stop. My only reason for 4 versus 5 stars is the rather anti-climactic ending. I had hoped for more of a BIG ending!But I would recommend this book.
4,Loved it!!,"Seems to me that every one is picking this book apart, but I loved it, I couldn't put it down and went through it faster than I did any of her other books, I am a BIG FAN of Fern Michaels, can't wait to pick up another one of her books. Enjoy it for the story........ people!"
1,The Nosy Neighbor,"The reviews are correct. This book was painful to finish. I skipped several pages and still followed along easily. There was much repeating of same information. zzzThe meatloaf puzzled me. Why go to so much trouble for a dog? Did the characters eat meatloaf, too? She apologized for the uncrusty potatoes. She could have easily baked them in the oven with the meatloaf. The meatloaf went in about 5:00, at which time she proceeded to take the dogs for a half mile walk, had an accident with a live wire, hobbled home, exhausted herself building a fire which blazed within seconds, then took a nap, woke up and wiped the sleep from her eyes.... That's a long time to bake a meatloaf. And why didn't she report that live wire to the proper authorities?As others said, this is not Fern Michael's best work."
1,I see I'm not alone,"I have to say this book was a major disappointment. I've read some bad books but this has to be in my top ten. The best parts that come to mind are the dogs. They stole the show in this drivel. I felt like this whole book was one big rush job. Wylie wasn't the least bit appealing and I didn't have alot of sympathy for Lucy either. But, I'm not giving up on Fern completely. Hopefully, this was just a fluke."
1,Don't waste your time,"This book is not worth the time. I found myself wondering how it even got published, and whether the auther just thinks her readers are stupid. The dialogue is ridiculous and annoying, the characters and situations are inconsistent. The ending wraps up way to easily and quickly. I can suspend my belief to get behind reading minds, but what I can't get behind is an author that doesn't even research the details of her book. The security system stuff was confusing and ridiculous. I finished it only because I cannot put a book down with out finishing it. When I was done, I wished I could have had the time back!"
1,Disappointing To Say The Least,"I've read Fern Michaels books for many years off an on and have never been as disappointed in any book as I was this one. I truly had to make myself finish the book only because I paid for it. I seriously considered taking the book back and asking for my money back if I could've found the receipt, but alas, it was long gone. This book was truly just dumb. Sorry, I hate to write anything bad but feel this book needed this."
2,Plodding tale of a Nigerian village.,"Aluko's ""One Man, One wife"" tries to tell us a story about how a Nigerian village tries to keep its pagan identity despite the missionaries, and but frankly, it really isn't that interesting. A cateism teacher is run out of out on rumors, and becomes a long-winded writer of letters, which we roll our eyes at."
2,slow for Mac users,"It freezes my Mac computer, it works okay in a PC but still slow. It should include drivers or some kind of application to make it work normally."
4,skechers little girl shoes,"Adorable little shoes, but it seems skechers run a little small. We exchanged them at a local store instead of returning them. We have had this problem with skechers before, I had just forgotten. So, next time buy a size up!!!"
3,The Foundation,"In most circles these days, your first album is the starting point of what could be a great career. However, we've seen many careers started after the sophomore effort (most notably Nirvana and Public Enemy). Gang Starr proves to the world that the latter is true.Tight beats and solid lyrics gives this album the appeal it needs. As far as early 90's rap is concerned, this album is a keeper. Several tracks will live forever in the minds of true fans.The first single, ""Just To Get A Rep"", solidified this crew as one to be reckoned with. The follow-ups (""Who's Gonna Take The Weight"", ""Love Sick"", ""Step In The Arena"", and ""Take a Rest"") made them a force in the rap game that would last longer than 90% of all acts to follow (Where is Sir Mix-A-Lot?).In an ideal world, ""Step In The Arena"" would be the perfect introduction to the music of Gang Starr. However, If you're reading this to try to decide whether to buy this album, I'd recommend a latter Gang Starr release."
3,Wasnt all that funny,This was such a disappointment. The comedians that were on this DVD was not funny at all. it was too short and wasnt worth the money that was paid for it.
5,Very helpful,"I'll be taking the SAT IIs in October and I'm glad I ordered this book now, mostly because it's so huge! But I've looked through it (not thoroughly yet, of course) and it looks very informative. It should be, shouldn't it? Since the people that wrote it also write the test!"
5,GREAT BOOK,I loved this book. I love the writer. Children who read it will be smarter. Too bad all children's books can't be like this one.
1,Shallow,"This book has pretty pictures, nothing else. I just spent a month in Rio, and it was just dead weight carrying it around. It has no detail, and no specifics. Get the Lonely Plane Guide for Brazil, and it will give you everything you need to really have fun in Rio--I used it every day to plan what I did."
3,Good book. Pricey recommendations. Good background.,"This is a very interesting book, with good pictures and excellent stories and background. Recommended places are more oriented to the well-to-do tourist, so accomodations, etc. not useful for the budget traveller. But worth it for the playful and educational stories."
2,Out of date,"This book should have got 4 or 5 stars 5 years ago. (The prefaces says that parts of the book were written before 9/11.)In the 5 years, a lot has changed. Most of the neighborhood prices listed have doubled or tripled, and the information for many neighborhoods has become out of date. I found the historic summarys interesting, but when the book describes the current state of neighborhoods it often fails to be acurate. This is especially true outside of down and mid town."
1,Too outdated,"I should have noticed all the positive reviews here were as outdated as this book. What's more, the title was misleading. It's actually only about neighbourhood information, population stats, etc. Not helpful for me cuz I was trying to look for no-fee buildings and management companies."
1,"How about ""The WORST baby name book"" ?","Unless you enjoy reading a book as interesting as the dictionary this book isnt for you. I bought it because it had mentioned it hadPopular and favorite namescelebrity nameshistorical and royal namesnames from around the worldThe history and meaning of each nameSure it has all of that but not in chapters like I assumed! If the name happens to belong to a celebrity than it mentions it and so on. Also this has so many names in it that I couldnt see anyone actually naming their child- how about a precious little girl named ""Welcome"" or ""Wapeka"". Sorry if any of you have named your children that and I have offended you, I just dont think most people are looking for these names when choosing a baby bookIts simple, this book is in alphabetical order for girls and boys. If you enjoy reading until your eyes are blind by all means buy it."
1,Boring!,I needed to have this book for class and it is so boring. I can only read a page before I just have to stop because it's just that dull.
5,school book,I'm going to school online and do not have the time to sit at my computer and read the required text. It was awesome to find the book at Amazon and get the Prime shipping. The money I saved in ink cartridges ( I would print the text so I could take it with me and read during my free time ) alone plus the gas money I would have spent going to the nearest book store was worth it all. Thanks Amazon.
3,Good Book & Easy to follow,"Good book and easy to follow, but most of the book I would consider common sense."
1,I ordered the wrong edition,"I am new with ordering books online and probably committed what is considered to be the #1 rookie error -- I ordered an out of date edition. I needed #8 and ended up with #7. This error cost me $27 bucks because the differences in the two editions are so great that I really need Edition 8 for my current class.It could have been worst, but upon hindsight I wish the edition number was displayed more predominately on the description page for this book. My advice is to increase the image of the publication and do whatever is necessary to confirm the edition number before ordering this book, just as you would with any other book before ordering."
3,Ouch,"These shoes are very cute, and just what I was hoping they would be except they really hurt. The support is not that great and the rubber top that covers the toes, diggs into your little toe. After the blisters went away they were fine but it took a long uncomfortable time."
5,Excellent Resource for Human Service Professionals,"For human services professionals interested in establishing an effective quality control program, this book is very helpful. Published by Paul H. Brookes, it contains detailed information on how to structure performance standards, monitoring, and staff training.Using the authors' suggestions, I was able to adapt their periodic service review protocols to fit my needs. The price of this book may seem steep, but in terms of the potential enhancements to your quality of services, it is cheap. The authors are experts in the field and know what they are talking about. By the way, I am not affiliated with the authors or Brookes publishing in any way. You may email me at rtaylor90@yahoo.com if you would like to ask specific questions relevant to this book."
1,waste of money,I was very dissapointed in the movie. Also had hard time hearing some of the dialog. The voices were barely audible while the musical scores Blared.
4,This is the king of Bargain shooters......,"Like many gamers I get my paycheck and head to the stores in search of games, Carnivores: CityScape was not the game I was planning on buying but after I installed it the game impressed me right from the get go....I'm a long time fan of the AVP (Aliens Versus Predator) series and this game game was along the same lines. The graphix are about the best iv'e seen from a budget shooter and overall it's just a blast to play...especially as the Agent who has a few nifty vision modes and some descent weapontry....the only thing i found lacking in this game was the lack of video sequences but over all it's still one hell of a game."
2,An average book who tells a fascinating family story.,"The story has been told before in a Pulitzer Prize nominated book entitled, ""The Ditchdigger's Daughters"" which was made into a Cable TV movie. The writing style is simplistic and rambling with no direction. It's a great story, but it was written better by her sister, Yvonne."
2,"Toshiba 32D47 Good picture, poor sound","Toshiba 32D47 32"" SuperTube CRT TVThe picture is pretty good; controls are reasonably convenient. But the sound quality is uneven. On one channel the sound is so scratchy that the channel is unusuable."
2,Is someone trying to make a joke?,"CRT 32-inch TV you price it $250??Is somebody burn out his mind??Come on, we are looking for a reasonable TV, not some joking antique..."
5,Beethoven Piano Sonatas,"Simply beautiful, Beethoven's finest sonata. I listen to this album often, and never weary of its peaceful and pleasureable music. Beethoven, my favorite, with Mozart and Chopin not far behind. All three were magnificent. Yet these sonatas of Beethoven's are truly glorious and peaceful in a world of noise and being too busy. Relax, listen to Beethoven in the car or at home. Ladies, enjoy a bubble bath while listening to the charming sounds of these sonatas, just keep the cd player far away from the tub! Happy bathing; happy listening. Refresh yourself in classic music."
3,Not so convinced!,"Allthough this CD has maybe more Beats and more drive than ""Tranceport I"", I think it by far does not have the rich sound and good song quality as Tranceport by Paul Oakenfold or other great records of that kind have!"
1,Don't bother,"If you're older than 14, don't bother with this album. It's boring, typical, and already dated. If you want something new, skip this."
5,BANGIN'!,"I've known Christopher for 4 years and besides being one of the nicest DJs in the world, he's a true professional and talented artist. This cd well represents his style of trance that has rocked so many crowds around the world. Ever since I spun with him in 1996, he's been known as a DJ who's guaranteed to satisfy any crowd that wants hard, heavy-hitting progressive dance music. As with his sets, this disc starts off smooth and progresses right into a whirlwind of sounds and beats from another dimension. I can't really describe the sound but it will definitely get you moving and is great to drive to on the way to a party to get you hyped up. To put it simple, buy this if you want a solid and smooth trance experience."
2,dog toy,"very fast in shipping, cost of shipping to much.and it has a very hard time getting it to squeak.so if you can find at a store just buy it there."
2,At Your Own Risk,"Well, I bought this camera awhile back. The picture quality didn't bother me much because I wasn't expecting much out of it. The problem I had with it was that after a couple weeks the memory stopped working right. It would erase all the pictures i had stored if I didn't keep it from auto-shutting off. Then about a month into it, it stopped working totally."
4,Get what you pay for.,"Like the other said, don't buy this as a replacement for a digital camera. It works great as a webcam though. I wanted a camera comparable to the Intel Pocket PC, and this is the closest one I could find for much cheaper. The image quality still isn't as good as the PocketPC cam but you get what you pay for. I'm satisfied with my purchase."
2,grainier than quite a large beach,"I bought this camera to replace a four-year-old webcam, which had finally died. To the best of my memory, the old one hadn't been particularly expensive either. When it was all plugged in, however, the quality of the pictures was so grainy that it prompted me to get a screwdriver out and fix the old one.The old webcam rides again, and logitech will be getting this one back."
1,"Poor Quality, Driver Problems","Pictures are grainy and of poor quality for the specifications. I also get a lot of flicker while in Webcam mode. Useless to take outdoor pictures. My phone takes much better pictures. To top it all off, Windows XP fails to locate the USB device though sometimes I can get it to work by reinstalling drivers."
2,Good but very basic,"The camera is small, which makes it convenient to grab quick snapshots; it holds a lot of pictures; and the plug-in-and-download feature is nice. However, there's no preview window, and the image quality is disappointing. It's pretty average as a webcam. Also, installing the software on my Win98 box slowed the computer down significantly, though this was not a problem on WinXP. Overall, if you're looking for a basic starter camera or a webcam, this is a decent choice, but don't expect much."
2,Cheesy Camera,"I bought this several weeks ago, took it out of the box, and straightaway I noticed that it had a manufacturer's defect, so I sent it back, and requested a replacement. Amazon.com sent one out to me right away, which was great, but with a note attached that they had received too many complaints about this product. Camera Limits are (to be brief): no LED View Screen, no flash capability, looks and feels like a disposable ""[money] job"" I really can't recommend this particular model and it is too bad, because it was a great idea!.. Positives: easy to use, I like the stand it sits on, but that's about it. ""Caveat Emptor"". The best thing about this whole experience: Amazon.com!! They were really cool in my opinion to send me a note about this product, advising me about all the other customer complaints. Good Job Amazon!"
1,Would of given half star if possible...,"Web cam feature bites, picture is all dark, even if you have all lights on and windows open. As far as the camera, you better have a VERRY well light area that you are taking the picture in. Would not reccomed this to anyone. I've bought from Logitech before with no problems, but this one was a big dissapointment."
3,For the money it's worth it.,I gave it as a gift. But I did see it in action and very impressed. The quality and setup was well worth it. And very satisfied.
2,Get what you pay for,"I bought a 310 camera a few years ago and it works fine and takes good pictures but, the batteries go dead after every use, which can get expensive if you do not have rechargable ones. Also, the software is not very good at all. It does have a lot of options though, such as stop action, motion detect and video. I eventually wound up buying a real camera that uses rechargable batteries."
2,Terrible.,"Let me put it this way, if you got it for your kids, they will love it as a fist digital camera, however, don't buy it for adults, the quality is so bad in comparison to regular 35mm cameras, you'd be very disappointed."
2,quality stinks,It works.... if you dont want them to see you on the other end of the cam then its great.
4,Good Buy,"This isn't a replacement for a real digital camera. It only has a small amount of built-in memory, has no screen to view your pictures on and only takes them at a very low resolution. However, it is worth while for quick snapshots for friends and family. In good lighting conditions, the camera gives surprisingly high quality pictures, given the caveats above, but suffers quite a bit in low light.As a webcam it works fine, but again low lighting hurts the picture, even with the lighting boost turned on. Installation is as easy as it possibly could be and if all goes well (which it did for me) you should be using it within about five minutes. Pictures you take away from the PC are downloaded very quickly via the USB connection and getting them from the camera to the PC is simply a matter of plugging in and clicking one button.It's a worthy buy and I'm very happy with mine, but don't expect miracles."
1,Horrible quality - Not worth the money,There is nothing positive I can say about this camera. The pictures are dark and blurry. The software is cheapy and horrible. When used as a webcam the quality is garbage. My advise to other shoppers out there: Spend a few bucks more and buy some other model.
1,Shoddy translation,"I don't speak Portuguese, but I've read Pessoa in Italian translation, and I consider his poetry remarkably powerful. I would think that, based on linguistic similarities, Italian translations in general would be more faithful to the original Portuguese than English would be.I bought this edition of Pessoa, translated by Richard Zenith, and was so terribly disappointed by the shoddiness of the translation that I was forced to write this review to defend Pessoa. Zenith fails miserably in conveying the sheer haunting power of Pessoa. Zenith's English is too colloquial for the task. Portuguese is not like Russian or Arabic: one would have to work fairly hard to make a translation this bad; or be awfully enamored of one's own poetical abilities, instead of being a faithful conduit of the original language.You ought to read Pessoa, but find a better translation."
5,Seiko Women's Watch,The product was as presented and very satisfactory.The service and delivery were very timely.I am totally satisfied.
1,eComm Store,I bought this software at a Fry's superstore. I previously read info about it on the Trellian website. After purchasing this for $39.99 plus tax I soon found out what a worthless piece of crap this software is. Furthermore you are forced to host it on their sight and pay extra monthly costs to recieve emails from your sales as well as a seperate monthly fee to have a simple product search engine on your site. Frankly if I buy a software for e-commerce I should not have to give a penny more to this company who made such a shabby software in the first place. Steer clear of this sucker.
3,"It does float up like others say, no matter what you do. I thoufght of a rock but then that will most likely, most highly likely","I thought of a rock but then that will most likely, most highly likely will it block most or all of the suction. Great idea overall, but all THE MANUFACTURER NEEDS TO DO FOR MINISCULE CHANGE AND PERFECTION IS TO INVEST IN A SMALL PLASTIC CLIP, LIKE THAT OF A SMALL MASON JAR WITH THE OLD FASHIONED LIDS. THAT WAY IT WILL NOT BLOCK THE FLOW AND WILL NOT FLOAT UP. !!!! THINK ABOUT IT!! BECAUSE IT BOBS AND FLOATS ALL OVER THE PLACE!!!"
2,It works for now...,"It works for now...I seem to still be skimming alot of debris from the top of the pool, its not working like I thought it would."
2,"Graphically nice, Performance Awful.","The reason this gets 2 not one star is that the graphics are crisp and clean. The music is completely obnoxious however you won't have to worry about it too much because the game crashes like mad, at least for me it did. The number of games available are pretty expansive and the gameplay itself is fairly solid. The animation though is slow and at times laggy. It doesn't have an authentic feel, the sound of the balls hitting is hollow and the physics seem just off. It feels like your hitting the ball across a wet soggy table. I'd stay away from it at all costs there are better pool games out there.If your curious about hardware issues my system when having the crashing issues is a P4 1.9 with 640 RAM and ATI Radeon 8500LE."
3,Mediocre,"First, I felt this book was terribly overpriced. In order to use the book, one must have an intimate knowledge of the International Phonetic Alphabet...which I have. With that knowledge, this book gives little that cannot be found in a French dictionary which uses the IPA. My main subject of interest was how one physically forms the French sounds. This book contains nonthing on that subject."
4,Kindle Version is better,"I have the first edition of this book in paperback and bought this one, but was skeptical of what would be updated, other than 10 new hikes, especially after someone reviewed that it didn't have the hikes organized by geographical areas. Wrong! The Kindle version delivers and is organized by region. Download the sample and look at the table of contents. I compared one hike from the previous book with the Kindle version and was pleased with the updates. The information before each hike has been updated: difficulty, trail surface, best season, water availability, land status, nearest town. The map was updated too. It also adds a summarized 'miles and directions' for each hike, which is a nice added feature that will be helpful. I will be using this version and discarding my paperback. Thanks!"
5,Must counter-rate!!!,"Although I would normally rate this 4 stars, I must counter-rate that 1-star review!In my opinion, this is a very solid album. DJ Akira really knows how to work those melodies, but the weak point of this album is the uncreative bass drum beats. For the most part, she only does the basic quarter-note beat, instead of getting creative like on her previous two albums.But for the most part, very good effort. She also has a very good choice of voice samples. It's too bad that DJ Akira is very unappreciated.Oh, yeah. And Aphex Twins suck!"
4,Just Plain Good.,"D.J. Akira has always been a ""groovemaster"" to me. Her awesome techno beats and trance tracks have been a favorite of mine for a long time. I especially enjoy the track ""madness""."
3,I Liked It,Need something to read on a lazy Saturday afternoon? Pick up this one and become engrossed in the lives of five bookclub members and the author who crosses their path. I enjoyed this one - the antics of Marcus Brooks and Johnnie Coleman were the highlights for me. It's interesting that Spencer was able to capture the thought-process and dialogue of Marcus Brooks and make it down-right unbelievably believable. That line about Eric Benet had me laughing out loud.
2,This book does not appear to be for anyone over 30,"My bookclub recently read this book and it generated the lowest rating of any book we've read in the last 9 years. The ladies in my bookclub are between the ages of 32 - 50+ which may have contributed to the low rating. The comments from the book club were as follows.....The story was unrealistic. Childish. Characters not well developed. Rushed ending. Ending was anticlimactic.Even though we gave the book a low rating, it amazingly...generated a good lengthly discussion with topics ranging from marriage to how silly we were in our youth."
2,Misery loves company.......,"Obviously it choose me. I read this book a few months ago and a previous experience jogged my memory to this book.A over confident arrogant author runs into the wrong women one night as he attempts to get his money back from a hustlin' bum. As he attempts to strangle and hit the woman, four VERY different close knit friends come to the rescue. After they realize that it is the one and only Marcus Brooks, they decide to take matters in their own hands (literally) and kidnap him. Oops, adultnap him.After what it seems like for me years of holding him hostage, all he has to do is write a book that caters to women instead of dogging women. Which I won't tell you what the title of his new book was. Anyway, this tale was long and drown out with a few little twists that probably should have been kept out.Does this sound like ""Misery"" to you?"
5,Awesome,"This book was the bomb, I read it in 1 day. Her best book yet I couldn't really get into All hell breaks loose kinda old."
2,"Academic, obtuse writing style ruins an interesting thesis.","If you are looking for a possible answer as to why Scott and Shackleton risked their lives to get to the South Pole, this is NOT the book. Written in the style of a very dry doctoral dissertation, I May Be Some Time clouds some interesting ideas with turgid prose, tortured sentence structure, and an air of academic snobbery."
1,Pretentious - moi?,"Relentlessly prolix, unbearably sententious, I found reading this book like climbing out a snowdrift - hard work! There are whole pages without a paragraph and my skipping techniques were tested to the utmost. What a pity - the history of polar exploration is a fascinating subject that deserves better treatment: perhaps Mr Spufford is trying too hard. Within the heaps of slush there are a few nuggets of, if not gold, then silver plate, but most are contained in the last chapter, which takes some getting to! All told, a classic Don't Buy."
5,Awesome,Are you really sure that is Scott isn't Brazilian?After all these years in Brazil he definetely got the brazilian soul.Wonderful cd to listen on a Friday night with good friends and some caipirinhas
4,Alternate military history,"The author of this unusual novel of a ""Red"" (i.e. Soviet) Napoleon who sweeps over the world in the 1930's was a war correspondent with the Marines in Belleu Wood in WWI. (He also wrote a romanticized biography of the Red Baron.) He was therefore familiar with the weapons and tactics of the time, and knew how to write a rousing yarn. Fascinating battles fought in places like Saratoga culminate in a naval engagement a la Jutland, but in the Caribbean. The author mixes in real leaders of the time, such as Churchill (who becomes P.M.). Some may be offended by bizarre speeches concerning ""miscegenation,"" but Gibbons actually seems sympathetic to the victims of racial prejudice. Concentrate on the wild political and military storyline, as the Red Napoleon picks up the fleets and armies of Europe and Asia one by one, giving him the strength for his final assault on America."
2,disappointing!,"I love working with chunky yarns. Instant gratification. I was so excited when this book came out. Now that I have it I am very disappointed. The patterns are blah! She doesn't give you the pattern for the pink sweater on the front, which is really cute. I found two patterns in the whole book, that I would make. The rest just aren't inspiring. She also showcases a very limited selection of the bulky yarns available. All in all a big disappointment."
4,"Plain patterns, but easy to knit & modify","When I first bought this book I was a little bit disappointed, but then I realized that the simple patterns were extremely easy to modify and add your own flair, unlike more complicated patterns. I added a braided cable to the last sweater in the book, and it turned out beautifully. With this book I've been able to knit an entire sweater in a weekend, and to me that's worth having it!"
2,Look before you leap!,"I too was excited to get my Chunky Knits but once I received the book, felt disappointed. Too many of the patterns are retro, and look like you got it at a Thrift store as opposed to spending a lot of time and effort to make it. There is a nice coat, but I won't make most of what is in the book.If you have teens, they might like the designs, or maybe not! Check it out first!"
4,Not bad,"I have made a Finished Object (FO) form this book, and find it useful and well-written. Of course some of the yarn used has been discontinued, but oh well. As for the person who said the pattern for the pink sweater onthe front isn't in the book, have you checked out page 48 for project 4: the ""Ladies' Turtleneck Raglan "" or not?I'm not a new beginner, but I've not been knitting for years either. I found the book to be easy to follow and I like the patterns. My mom does too.It's probably a worthwhile investment as far as knitting books go."
2,Where is the cover pattern?,"I bought this book online for the cute sweater on the cover.I can not find it in the book. Either they pulled the sweater together on the back side to make it look like a fitted waist, short cropped sweater for the cover photo,or this sweater is just not in the book,at least not the way it is shown on the front cover. What's up with that??I bought this book just for this sweater pattern and it is not in there.Is this a joke? If you see it in there, please post a note here."
1,Flexible Arm Scam,"A few of years ago, I bought a dual headset TV Ears. Technically it performed very well in terms of amplitude and tone control as well as allowing independent control of each headset. However, within a relatively short time, the ""flexible"" arms of one of the headsets snapped. I was able to glue the sections but it simply cracked in another part of the ""flexible"" arm. When I reported this to the company, I was told to simply BUY a replacement headset. In rapid order (at intervals of a few months), both ""flexible"" arms of both headsets cracked. In short, although doctors may recommend this product, according to its advertisement, it clearly needs an engineering assessment and truly flexible arms.DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT without checking whether the above manufacturing improvement has been made!!"
1,"TV Ears Work, But Will Break Before Long","I have bought two sets of TV Ears 2.3They work wonderfully, when they work.And, that is not for long.I have had a transmitter die, one channel in a receiver die, and the plastic stalk on one side of the receiver snap. I am continuing to use whatever functions until they fail completely.This product is of poor quality and I would highly recommend against purchasing it."
1,TV Ears hugely disappointing,"After much excitement at the lightweight and effective performance of my 2 sets of TV Ears, I have to express extreme disappointment not with just the product, but with the company. Their warranty is lousy, I suspect, to match the durability of their product. We are a two person household and I bought two pair of TV Ears. They were not used daily, by children or careless people. However one of the transmitters went out, then one headset, and then the other headset; all within 6 months of purchase. When I called TV Ears, they explained their lame 90-day warranty and offered to send me a new transmitter for a mere 49.99.Buy yourself a real pair of wireless headphones that has a legitimate warranty. Had I known last year that Sony made such headphones, I would have purchased those instead. Now, that's what I'm getting our home for Christmas."
2,TV-EARS Problems,TV Ears 10041 Original System (Black)We purchased 2 sets of TV-EARS (from COSTCO) and enjoyed them as long as they worked. Both set of ear phones seamed to quit. We tried both our transmitters with no success so we sent them back. After a month we were contacted that the transmitter IR lights did not work. They wanted $24 for each transmitter and ~$5 for shipping. One transmitter was over a year old and the other about 6 months. There is only a 90 day warranty. Trying to get them on the phone took a while. They either don't have many support people or a LOT of people calling them.BUYER beware.
1,Retailers should drop this product,"This product worked satisfactorily at first although obviously poorly and cheaply constructed. After about 9 months it simply stopped working and nothing I could do would revive it. You are advised not to waste money on this junky, poorly warranted and over-priced device."
5,Great - As Advertised,"Love it, I can now understand George Will (his words, not always what he says). Have TIVO and a DVD and the rear of the tv is confusing what with all the wires, but nothing my Son could not resolve."
4,TV Ears helped my Dad,"My father hadn't been able to listen to his TV very well for years so we thought we would try the TV Ears. The setup was simple enough and he loves them. They feel a little cheap and I wonder how long they will last. For now, he is happy."
2,TV ears not that great!,"TV ears sounded like a good idea and indeed they do help the sound quality for someone who is moderately hearing impaired. But there are problems. First the quality of construction is terrible. The right arm broke off with no reason what so ever. Before that the ear plugs were either too loose (would fall off) or too tight and very uncomfortable. Also there was interference from some lights in my house. And the range on this thing was quite limited (8 ft or more and static overwhelmed everything.All in all, I am sorry I bought the system. Wish there was something better out there."
1,A huge disappointment - Did not last 6 months,"These worked GREAT for about 6 weeks. I purchased both the base unit with the 1 headset and I purchased a second headset because the company claimed that the base unit will charge two headsets at the same time.I have now had them for 5-1/2 months and the back part of the recharging unit no longer works at all. That means only one headset unit can be charged at one time.The ad for this headset claims that the TV Ears will fully recharge in only 1 hour. That is not true.In addition to the back part no longer charging, the batteries do not last more than 3 to 3-1/2 hours.I called TV-ears yesterday and they said there is nothing they can do to help me since I purchased these thru Amazon, not directly from them.Please take my review seriously. I do not recommend this item and I am disappointed in myself for not reading other reviews posted in Amazon before I purchased these."
1,WASTE OF MONEY,"They worked well for a short time then the batteries went out. They cost about as much as buying the product new so turns out to be quite expensive. We went and purchased wireless headsets made by Sennheiser and they work great. Great idea if the batteries lasted. And we only watch TV for a couple of hours in the evening, so it isn't like they were used all day long."
4,TV Ears,"TV Ears 10041 Original System (Black)For some one who doesn't want to wake his wife at nightbecause you are watching tv, this will work. Its not the most wonderful sound system in the world, but it works ok. Would recomend it for some one who wants something like this but does not want to spend a lot of money."
2,Overcharged me,"My first one was a defective product. It had static on the line. I called the company and after troubleshooting they sent me a new unit (not the entire unit but a headset and the thing that charges it). Fortunately I didn't throw out the old one because a month or so later I found a charge on my visa for $154. I called them and told them to destroy my visa info and asked how they could charge something on it that I hadn't authorized. They said I was supposed to have returned the other parts when the new came. However, they said their records didn't reflect that I had been told this so they would credit me. Well they didn't credit me the entire amount and I am sick of contacting them so I will let it go.I think the unit is cheap, it hurts, the sound isn't that great and I would never deal with them again because of their keeping my visa info and charging me."
1,Junk,"after 3 months the ears will break. have gone through 2 pair, are not any better. will find different brand"
2,Cheap constrution,"I am on my third set of tv ears, and if this one breaks I will not buy any more. I don't have problems with the ears when they work, but for some reason they break at the base of the arms. I am not rough with the ears, but they seem to break when I put them in my ears. I think they need to improve the arms so that they can flex without breaking.I will probably look for some alternative product."
1,very poorly made,"We bought one of these for my mother in law - it worked great for one night. We returned them, and got another - it worked for one day. They look like they should cost $10, not $100. You have to play with the headset to get it to charge on its cradle. I would not recommend these to anyone."
1,TV EARS IS A RIP-OFF!!!!,"First I had problems fitting the headset ""just so"" in the cradle so it would charge correctly. Then I noticed that they became very uncomfortable in my ears after about 30 minutes. Finally, after months of a bad connection (where I had to tap the circuit in the bottom of the headset until I heard sound), my TV Ears suddenly ceased to function. Now all I hear is static when I switch it on. I wonder how often this has happened, because when I call 1-888-TV3EARS or their HELP # (866-611-9944), the greeting I get is ""MAILBOX IS FULL."" And I wouldn't be so foolish as to pay the company $99 (per their ""Lifetime Service Guarantee"") for a new TV Ears System!"
4,Does a good job ! Would like to see Improvements!,They are very clear and have good range. Especially helps with voice range where it is needed the most. I would like to see improvements such as a swival on the ear piece and soft rubber ear buds to improve on the confort level in the ear.
1,Overpriced Junk,"This is made out of a dollar or two worth of materials and electronics and is way overpriced. It buzzes around many TVs and other electronic equipment unless you position the transmitter in just the right place and set with the receiver in just the right place. Because of the low quality construction and trouble to avoid the buzzing, it is just not worth the price it is sold for."
2,cheap construction,"I have used these for about 3 years. On the first set, after 6 months or so the 2 screws that hold the head set together became loose and the container began to seperate. I tried tightening the screws but they would not budge and I didn't want to force them. I returned this set and received another. I've had them almost 2 years and the same thing is happening. The screws are too small and cheap and won't bite as the openings are also not deep enough. As for performance I was very satisfied but not if the headset requires replacement so often."
2,tv ears,"should have beed designed as ear muffs. these are uncomfortable and become annoying after a short while. they do work well for the sound part but the design is not worth the money. as long as you are in an upright position they work well, for all other positions they are uncomfortable."
3,Exorbitant price.,The manufacturer offers this on their web site for $140.00 (single headset.) Hearing aid stores charge the same.
3,T V EARS,WHEN YOUR TV EARS WONT HOLD A CHARGE YOU WILL NEED TO REPLACE THE BATTERIES AT A COST OF $25.OO. THE BATTERIES ARE PART 0F THE FRONT PLATE AND MUST BE BOUGHT FROM TV EARS. I THINK THIS IS A RIP OFF. RADIO SHACK HAS THEM FOR AROUND $19.OO.PRODUCT NO. 23-481. ON LINE ONLY
2,Wrong model for my TV !,"I have a flat-screen LCD TV, and the original TV ears does not work well with flat screen TVs...they pick up static from the flat screen. If you have a flat screen TV, you need to get the professional model of TV ears. I was luckey, and Amazon took them back and refunded the purchase price in full; then I bought the professional model, which works fine !"
3,Brackets too flimsy,"The ear brackets are a bit week. After a few months, one of them bent, then, finally broke. The need to be strengthened.The range is not that good. I have to be within 15' of the TV to get clear reception.Once settled down & comfortable, & not moving, it works just fine. I prefer it over my hearing aid as the ear plugs block out background sound."
2,Does what it says it will!,"Tvears do work as stated on the website, so that is why I'm giving it 2 stars.I have to agree with a few of the other reviewers the Tvears are very uncomfortable to wear for any length of time. After trying them for a week, back in the box they went to be returned.If you have a loved one that is bedridden I think these would work fine. But any movement causes them to ""swing"" from the ears and becomes painful after a little while.For now, a moderate priced pair of wireless headphones will do."
1,Cheaply made!,"Please don't waste your money on this product. I purchased 2 sets for my parents as a gift. They were terribly disappointed, the tvears are very poorly made..cheap, cheap, cheap. The earplug covers are actually a joke..the foam is just that a hunk of foam with a hole punched in it. They are very uncomfortable to wear. The weight of the tvears after 10 minutes is very uncomfortable. The only way they have found to tolerate the tvears is wear it on top of their head but it barely reaches the ear canal.Also, the customer service at tvears is not helpful and I stated all the above to them. Their response ""what do you mean by cheap?"" After I took the time to write and explain...I have yet to hear from them.I replaced the tvears with two pairs of wireless headphones I purchased from amazon, the cost was half and the reception is great...you can even walk around the yard and work while listening to news, music or whatever.SAVE YOUR MONEY, Don't be RIPPED OFF like I was!"
4,I got mine autographed!,"Zacherley is best know for being a horror movie host on various television stations, although he has done other things, like dee jay. He scored a Top Ten hit back in 1958 with the ghoulish novelty ""Dinner With Drac"". He went on to record a few more singles, plus four albums back in the 1960s. Dead Man's Ball was his first album in about 30 years. It features a remake of ""Dinner With Drac"", plus four more of his ""classic"" songs. The rest of the songs were written especially for this album. There are also some brief audio clips from Zacherley's old TV program. For the most part, the songs are pretty good. They are well performed by the musicians, and they are pretty funny. Sure, they are kind of corny, but if you like goofy ""monster"" themed songs, you should enjoy it. Recommended to fans of novelty records."
1,B.A.D.!,"This is not AT ALL what I expected on a CD by John Zacherle! First of all, I hate the fact that a lot of this disc actually consists of audio portions of Zach on his TV show, and the recording of ""Dinner With Drac"" isn't even the 1958 one that made #6 on the pop charts.By the way, I like Zach's backing group on ""Dinner With Drac"" (Dave Appell and the Applejacks) much better than this TV host-turned-really-bad-so-called-singer. And, you CAN find ""Mexican Hat Rock,"" ""Rocka Conga,"" and ""Bunny Hop"" on CD, on something called ""The Rock and Roll Story: 1954-63.""So, ""Dinner With Drac"" was the only song on here that was even slightly entertaining, and I hate that annoying cover. So, basically, don't really try to buy this, even if you are a fan of horror movies or whatever, and actually I'm not, or if you're trying to find the great, old '58 ""Dinner With Drac"" song. If you or someone you love have purchased this CD, BEWARE!"
1,THIS MACHINE SUCKS,ALTHOUGH THE FEATURES ARE GREAT AND IT'S A NICE COMPACT MACHINE AFTER ONLY FOUR MONTHS THE MESSAGES LEFT SOUNDED LIKE THEY WERE FROM ANOTHER PLANET AND YOU COULD NOT MAKE OUT ANY OF THE WORDS.AND TODAY I AM RESEARCHING INFO TO FIND ANOTHER MODEL....WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY
1,Machine is not worth the money,"Do not waste any money on this machine. The first one we bought quit working after 1 month. We replaced it and after 4 or 5 months, it now leaves messages that cannot be understood, they are all garbled. We will look for something other than AT&T."
1,flawed answerer,"I bought this machine from walmart for about 12 dollars about 6 months ago. It has a nice compact design, however it doesn't work properly. It didn't even record a message I thought I had left earlier. It's gonna find it's new home in my trash bag. The old fashioned tape ones still have an edge in voice quality. Look elsewhere for a good answerer, this one's a P.O.S."
2,does not record hang-ups,I just bought this AT&T answering machine and already thinking of returning it. The voice recorded sound more like a robot then human and it does not tell if a person hangs up. It only records a message if the person says a few words or more. I really miss the old answering machines with real cassettes. My old one was a Radio Shack and was bought in 1981 ! It only stopped working 2 weeks ago.
1,Don't buy,Didn't fit properly on my cj-5 instead at higher rpm the air cleaner hose collapsed in choking out the engine.
4,More than Just SimCity,"This game is a great fun addictive game. If you like simcity this adds a little twist. You have computer players that you can interact with. You can either be peaceful and trade with them, or hostile and take their island over. The pirates add a twist and a greater challenge to the game."
4,sircharles,"I own this game and have played many other PC games. 1602 A.D. is a hard game to learn because the manual (in my opinion) is not very clear. It took many hours of experimenting to grasp the controls and functions of the game. I really do enjoy playing 1602 A.D. but I never could get pass the Pirate's attacks. Every time a pirate ship would fire its connons, my computer would shut down and go to my main menu. I believe this was caused by my computer operating on Windows XP. I Highly recomend this game to anyone that likes to build cities, economies, and empires. I am looking forward to the release of 1503 A.D."
4,This will make your hair very soft and help to take away frizz,"This makes my hair so soft without being greasy. The softness does start to wear off though by the end of the day. I guess that is better then it getting greasy. It also takes away a lot of the frizz from my hair, but not quite as much as I would like. Another great thing about this product is that it does not weigh your hair down. Oooo and the scent is really nice and fruity. So inexpensive too and the bottle is huge so it lasts a long time."
4,"""Lucky Louie""- The Incarnation of Louis C.K.'s Humor","""Lucky Louie"" is Louis C.K.'s stand-up material translated into a sit-com. The characters each bring their own personal brand of humor to the show. Here, Louie as played by Louis C.K. is a common working class father with a wife and young daughter. The episodes highlite various topics talked about by Louis C.K. in his stand-up routines. Due to the nature of Louis C.K.'s humor, the show is for adults only. If you are a fan of Louis C.K. then I would pick this series up. There was only one season of this show, so it may be a collector's item in the not too distant future."
5,Lucky Louie,"Highly recommended....I had missed a few episodes so watching the whole set was quite interesting...hilarious, entertaining, worth the watch."
4,HBO's bad decision,"This show deserved more than one season from HBO. A direct descendant of the Honeymooners. The silver lining is that it has led to the Louis CK show, the best comedy on TV."
5,Some of the funniest TV I have seen in ages.,"I had never heard of Louie C.K. before watching this show, but damn is this man funny. I really thought that overall this (sadly short-lived) sitcom was very sharp, and quickwitted....a real slice of life. There are far too many of us using everything we have to scrape by these days and to tell you the truth it's a great thing to find ""everyday Joe"" kind of humor...presented in such a way that you end up laughing so consistently hard, that you feel good when it's over. I for sure plan on checking out more from Louie C.K.!"
5,Lucky Louie,"Absolutely hilarious!!! Not your typical cookie cutter family, everything is always peachy sitcom. I watched the whole season in two days...It's a shame HBO didn't pick these guys up for a second season:( An adult comedy that you'll say to yourself, ""hey that really happened to me."" Highly recomended!"
5,James Norden-Gone Before His Time,"An tremendous performer struck down before his time. Many might know him as the neighbor Rich in Lucky Louie but I'll always remeber him as Daddy. I used to tell him ""Hi Daddy"" when he used to come home from work. Him and Uncle Paul(R. Nelson) used to make me so much better when we would get caught in some nasty monster rain. Everyday for lunch he would make me some peanut butter and jelly with some crinkle crinkle cut fries. He was the best at what he did whether it was on stage or in the boardroom. I would like to thank all of the kind words I have gotten for my Big Daddy James. Many have asked ""Howd your father die?"", well this is very hard for me. He was HIV positive for over 5 years I would say. They would reply,""Thats Thats terrible Im sorry"" What else can you say besides..........................FFFFFFFRRRRRAAAANNNNNKKKKKUUUUSSSSSSS"
2,embarassing,"I like the work Louie CK has done but this sit com didn't work at all for me! Perhaps it was the writing or the subject matter or a combination thereof but for whatever reason these episodes left me confused, cranky, and quite itchy not to mention embarassed. I'm not saying not to buy it only that it didn't work at any level with me."
3,Funny....but,"Funny-raunchy, but Not as funny as the new show ""Louie"". A little hokey and on the nose. Still is sarcastic-funny."
5,WARNING: THIS SHOW IS HILARIOUS,"Lucky Louie is unlike any show that I can think of that combines extremely crass language and behavior with shockingly witty writing and superb acting by the entire cast. I don't know who the brainiac at HBO is who (a) marketed, and (b) decided to cancel, this show but he's the one who should be cancelled. This show has cult classic written all over it. Who knows, maybe HBO will pull a Family Guy."
5,fantastic show!,"This was a refreshing show. Very raw/raunchy humor. I loved it! Jim Norton is amazingly hilarious as usual. I was laughing though every show. Why did HBO cancel simething so great? :(Also, what's all this talk about james norton? What's going on??"
2,Please enter a title for your review,"The disgruntled husband who has the typical men are from mars women are from venus relationship with his wife, and the slob friends who he can talk about how he really feels to. This is sitcom b.s. 101. This is According To Jim with a bit more profanity. This is the guy who created Pootie Tang? He must have been choking back his creativity with every word he typed for these scripts. It plays like a cynical ""look how easy this is"" middle finger to the insipid drivel that fills half of tv schedules. If that was the intent, then mission achieved, but why waste your time?"
2,NOT FUNNY,"I really tried to like this series. The filming is grainy, bad set, bad humor, not a pleasurable experience."
3,Not Your Daddy's Groove Album...Though I Wish it Was!,"Being a big fan of Putumayo's Groove series (having bought and enjoyed World Groove, Asia Groove, African Groove, and even Arabic Groove), I was really looking forward to Turkish Groove. I (mistakenly) figured that since it was in the Groove series it had everything that I was looking for - i.e. a blend of traditional ethnic music with funky Western electronica and/or hip-hop beats. Unfortunately, Turkish Groove fails to deliver on that premise. Unlike a previous reviewer, I found very little ""hip-hop"" about this album, and was thus disappointed.Having said that, the (Turkish pop) music on this CD is enjoyable. The music is up-temple and you could probably dance to it - if you try real hard. Just be aware, it's not like some of the other CDs in Putumayo's Groove CD series."
3,Turkish Groove,I thought the CD would be more upbeat than it was. I am frankly disappointed with it.
2,Not a great compilation,"This is not a very good selection, all different kinds of songs thrown together. Doesn't make sense."
1,Won't install -- no support,"It wouldn't install on my vanilla XP Pro system, there's absolutely no support on the Laplink site, and it trashed my Lotus Notes installation in the process.It may install and work great for others, but for some reason it has been a complete waste of (too much) time for me!"
3,I honestly don't know what the other reviewers are hearing,"If you haven't heard a lot of great guitarists, I suppose Taylor might 'knock you out' with his sloppy speed. He is fast. But the Hendrix comparisons are absurd: Hendrix rarely played fast, while Taylor can barely ever pull back from full-speed. Hendrix strived for new sounds, structures, and feelings, while Taylor just shows off. Blues doesn't call for this approach; listen to Al DiMeola or Alan Holdsworth for clean, creative, speed-playing. This is just simple stuff with a guitar spilling out over it all. Jazz? Hardly. Slow this down, and will find it to be incredibly repetitive, juvenile, and devoid of feeling. Taylor simply doesn't know enough about music to sustain a jazz set. The stuff goes by in a flash, and unsophisticated listeners figure it must have been 'over their heads'...no, it's just fast. Three stars for speed."
3,Disappointed with results,"I purchased this dye to color some white baby onesies and tees. Even though the fabric I used was 100% cotton, it did not take the dye very well and the end result was a mottled appearance. It doesn't look terrible but it is not the look I was going for. Perhaps if I left them in the dye longer than instructed the color would have penetrated the fabric more evenly. I also purchased the royal blue dye at the same time, and the items dipped in the blue dye bath turned out beautifully. Everything else being equal, this leads me to believe that perhaps the darker colors of dye are easier to work with."
3,Bicycle Tires,These tires were what I ordered but I ordered the wrong size. Be sure you know what size you need before you order tires because it cost more than half what I paid to ship these back. I just decided to keep them and try to resale them.
5,His Royness at the touch of a button!,"This DVD is worth it for the Jones VS. Toney footage (exclusive to this DVD) alone (note that I picked this up at Wal-Mart/Sams for $9.40)!My only problems with this DVD are that: (1) it shares a lot of it's footage with ""Roy Jones Jr.'s Greatest Knockouts"" and (2) that we don't get to see the couple times he really tagged John Ruiz (the victim on the cover).Whining aside- any fan of fight sports needs to see Roy Jones' power -preserved here and ready for your viewing at the touch of a button.Mike Tyson's power turned out peoples lights, Foreman's hammered people; when Roy Jones hits people just right it looks like they've been thrown from a moving vehicle.Buy this. Make your friends watch it. Trust me."
2,Yes...but...NO!,"I suppose you could say that this book was okay, but there are a couple of things I don't like about it that would lower it down to a i-don't-think-so-I-just-might-puke kind of book. It started out okay...but then it blooped. The book had very little plot. Girl runs away to the gypsies to escape marriage (how many times have i heard that one?)Girl finds out she has the sight. Girl goes back home. Girl comes back to the qypsies. It might have been okay had the girl's character fit her actions. And you don't even get to know her very well. The writing was very good--nice and poetic--but the descriptions were so lengthy that the whole description is wasted because the words shoot through your head, but nothing actually connects. It's no wonder its out of print."
3,Lots of Fluff but Liked the Routines,"The video has a set of routines for groups, newborns and the lone mom, but they are all the same, so if you plan on going through the entire video, it will get a little repetative. There are also lots of comments from moms about why they love baby yoga which I found long and unnessary; kind of like an in video advertisement. That said I did like the routine and found the content very age appropriate for my child and I have had trouble finding dvds that fit this bill for children under 6 months."
1,Not so fun,"I was so excited when I got this as I loved mommy and me yoga classes in person. This DVD got used maybe twice. There is a ton of annoying talking among the moms and yoga lady and it was no fun for me or my son to sit through it or fast forward through each time. Unfortunately, this one had the best reviews of those on amazon. I suppose it could be useful to sit through once and write down the moves then do them on your own, but surely that could be done easier searching the web for moves. Don't waste your money."
3,Too much talking,"Like other reviewers have mentioned, there's just too much down time in this DVD. When you cut out all the commentary from other mothers, there's a grand total of 15 minutes of actual yoga. I don't want to have to sit and listen to moms introducing their babies and telling about their fussy times of the day every time I sit down to watch the DVD. I definitely enjoy the routine once we finally get down to it, but I decided to type out the routine and print it out so we can put on our own music and move it along without so much down time between the sections."
1,Not great for babies over 10 lbs.,"This yoga dvd requires you to hold your baby and move them back and forth from one arm to the other. Now... my baby is around 15 lbs. Having to move her back and forth from one arm to the other is very tiring. I hold her enough as it is and it wears me out [all new moms should know what I am talking about]. I turned this dvd on once and that was the last time I touched it. DO NOT PURCHASE, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
4,Pirate Movie,"A real surprise ending! I enjoyed this movie I taped years ago in the pre-digital format, but my VHS recorder was going bad and the quality was zero. I enjoyed the swashbuckling pirates having to take care of the children they had captured. Coeburn and Quinn were great in the part."
2,"A few chuckles, but not too good","I found this to be a absurd movie. It just has alot of things in it that are just too far-fetched, and the plot itself wasn't a strong one at that. To me it just seemed that it was trying to be a slapstick pirate movie, and it just didn't work. It tried to be a movie that all the family could watch, and it didn't work. It tried to be a disaster movie, and it didn't work. It tried to be a drama, and again it didn't work. I got a few chuckles out of it, it held my interest for maybe the 45 minutes to an hour that I watched it, but it was just sloppy, and uneven, and the best thing was watching most of the pirates in drag at the beginning."
5,Fabric office chair/ with arms,The chair was easy to assemble and very comfortable. It also works well the a small room where the computer is located.
2,Sitting on a fabric-covered board.,"The chair went together easy enough, it took only 1/2 hour with an allen wrench which came with it, but when you have to sit as a transcriptionist for many hours a day, this is not a good chair. The seat is hard, the arms are too high and don't adjust, when it's high enough for the keyboard your feet are off the ground, and when your feet are flat on the floor your wrists are kinked. It is not a very ergonomically correct chair at all. I'm a thin person and when having to sit for a long period of time, I need a little extra cushion in a chair since I don't have much built in. All in all, the chair looks nice and is relatively comfortable for short periods of time, but if you need to sit for any longer than an hour at a time, this is not the chair for you."
1,Unreliable,Failed after approximately 6 months. Bad seal allows water into device. My experience with this manufacturer is consistently poor.....only one of four devices worked consistently. Items returned for repair were returned still broken.....twice.
1,Product LEAKS so it fails,"I have purchased two of these units and they both have failed. They leak and that is what the problem is with this unit. I am going to go back to the thermometer probe. Unfortunately, the wire floats inside a spa or pool but it works because there is nothing to leak. Save your money don't buy this product."
1,Not water tight enough.,"Worked fine for 5 months. Now it has condensation on the inside of the display and shorted out the display. Still transmits the right temperature, but you can't tell the temp from the display because most of the segments of the digital numbers won't display."
2,Worked great until it leaked,"I bought mine for use in a hot tub. It worked great for several months and then developed a leak. I've opened it up, dried it all out, and sealed it up with silicone grease three times. And it still leaked. Now it's dead and won't function. Another expensive Oregon Scientific piece of junk. To call this item aterproof is false advertisement and someone ought to nail Oregon Scientific for that."
1,The Seals are Ridiculous,"I have had 2 of these Oregon Scientific Remote Waterproof Floating Thermometers. They work really well until, as others have noted, they leak, corrode and quit. My first lasted over 6 months; the second about 3 weeks.The seal designs are awful. The main housing seal should be an oring. The 4 screws that hold the 2 halves of the housing together should be placed outside of the main housing seal so they wouldn't have to be sealed. The screw seals now simply will leak. I've emailed Oregon Scientific but have had no response. What a disappointing product; it could be so good."
1,Disappointed and frustrated,"Oregon Scientific John Deere Waterproof Floating Thermometer. This item only works as a floating pool thermometer(until it leaks as I have been warned it will). You will have to pick it up and look at it to see the pool temperature. It does not transmit the pool temperature to ANY base stations - and we bought 3 all 433 MHz - each one more complicated than the last one. E-mails to Amazon and to Oregon Scientific for help as to which base station specifically to buy, go unanswered. Customer contact is nil."
2,WaterProof not waterproof,The unit did not communicate well and many found that it leaked after a few months. Returned it before that could be determined.Oregon Scientific John Deere Waterproof Floating Thermometer
3,"Has its flaws, but works good with a little tlc","The o ring seal will sometimes leak slightly, been using two of these thermometers for a couple years now for pool and spa. When I see the display becoming steamed up, I open the thermometer then dry it out with hair dryer, then wet the o-ring slightly with a little Pam (spray oil) which will keep the seal for much longer. Other that that small (potentially major) flaw, the devices have worked well."
3,Take precautions,"It's a really nice product and worked very well for close to a year.Then, as it seems to happen with others - it leaked and it dies.The guy who sealed it when he bought it had the right idea.I think I will buy another and silicon it up before I drop it in next time."
3,Average recording of Mozart's most beautiful opera,"In general, this $20-list-price recording of ""The Magic Flute"" made a good first impression on me, although some of the British singers spoke the dialogue with an audible accent. Beverly Hoch as the Queen of the Night did excellent on the high pitches (Nr. 4: ""Oh zittre nicht, mein lieber Sohn"") but the 3 Ladies sounded rather monotone. The tempo was extremely high (especially Nr. 21, Rezitativ, Andante, Allegro: ""Die Strahlen der Sonne"")."
2,Granddaughter loved it,Harry was a Christmas gift for my Geanddaughter. Her eyes nearly popped out of the sockets when she opened the package. She loved Harry and we loved the great service we received on this purchase.
3,"Great for Harry enthusiasts, but poorly made","The first Harry I received developed a serious split in his back seam after only a day or two of light use. Poor Harry's stuffing started coming out, so I sent him back. The next Harry I received had his nose sewn on crookedly, one crooked arm, and one ear bigger than the other. I tried one final time and this latest Harry seems to be okay, other than a sloppily sewn collar. The manufacturer really needs better quality control.On the plus side, the toy is extremely cute and really does look like the Harry in the books. He has a ""bean bag bottom,"" which allows him to sit up in a begging position. He's small (about 11"" tall from his bottom to the tip of his nose), but is still huggable. He is greatly loved by the child who received him."
4,DVD 47 Ronin,My husband and I own a martial arts studio and this classic fits right in.We were excited to see it on Amazon. We recieved it promptly and in good condition.
5,Helpful,"To find out which mushrooms grow in this area, I purchased ""Mushrooms of Colorado"" as soon as I moved to live at the foothills of the Rocky Mountains, and I wasn't disappointed. I learned basics of mycology from my father and grandmother, and I'm happy to attest that V.Evenson's book not only showed me the mushrooms I was already familiar with and that are common here, but greatly extended my knowledge of fungi in general."
2,Not progress over the original,"I used to have the original Trophy Hunter and enjoyed the game very much. I thought it would be fun to get the latest version and try it again. I knew before I bought it that this is an older game and didn't have high expectations for graphics or features. However, one would assume the 3rd version would be better than the first. Not so. The first version has better features, makes you earn additional equipment, gain skill, select how long you want to hunt, gives you bag limits and a list of what you can hunt for, etc. It's all fairly realistic for a hunting game. Trophy Hunter 3 is far less advanced than the original. You get everything up front and can basically hunt for everything and shoot as many as you want. You even add poached animals to your ""Trophy Room"". It's very lame. Game control from the keyboard is also much harder than the original. I'd buy the original again, but wouldn't waste my money on III."
3,Trophy Hunter 3,"The game is great, but it doesn't always work. During the menus, the screen skips around and you cannot choose items from the menu. Have uninstalled and re-installed and it didn't change."
4,A novel of 1 man's journey from his past to his future.,"Through recalling terrifying and traumatic events of his past, including his reluctant experience in the military with his best friend Ingo Budde, Paul Wedekind confronts his old life as an East German working for the secret police in order to build a new life as Paul Watkins, married to Suleika, a fellow ""ex-agent"". Finely drawn characters. A moving novel of one man's emotional journey from his past to his future. The author creates a picture so vivid and realistic that the reader can actually FEEL what's happening to Paul. A very exciting read. Well worth your time."
4,The Story of My Disappearance,"I picked up this book in London. I decided to look under the last shelf of the ""Fiction A-Z by Author"" section of my local bookshop, and chanced upon Paul Watkins' most recent novel.This is a good yarn. The narrator, Paul Weidekind, and his girlfriend Suleika are fishermen in North Eastern USA. Their apparently honest, hardworking life on the sea is turned upside down by the appearance on shore of someone for Weidekind's past who he thought he had left behind long ago. I don't want to detail the plot here as that would spoil it. Suffice to say this is a great thriller.Watkins' own experience on a deep sea trawler in North Eastern USA have clearly lent to his detailed descriptions of a fishermans' life. Watkins' also chooses historical contexts in many of his novels, as this one does.In short, I read this book in about two days. I recommend it wholeheartedly. You won't be disappointed."
5,Source book for real history!,"This is a must for anyone interested in the beginnings of anything! I understand Waddell was out of favor at one time (maybe even now) because of his criticism of Assyriologist obstruction of Sumerian research. But you must read about the origins of St George (of Merry England -- and Cappadocia)and his Trojan, Ancient Brits, Sumerians and, and -- wow all you want to know about early civilization! Those Sumerians! They went everywhere, Waddell explains, and left their marks everywhere -- but not as Sumerians because they became assimilated into where ever they were -- just like they went into America and Australia, and Scandinavia and virtually the world! They were the original long-distance ocean crossers! Just read it!"
3,Jon Bjerke,My wife and I really enjoyed this movie. It is a lighthearted farce of the old west. If you're looking for an entertaining 90 minutes get this movie.
4,John Candy final,John Candy fans will want his final movie. This is a reverse on the Westward Ho call and quite entertaining.
3,Mediocre Comedy,"Although I love Candy in every film I have seen him in, I was disappointed in this one.... it is slow, looks like it had rewrites along the way, possibly due to his death, but good for a few chuckles along the way. The characters, except for the two leads, are very good and really shine. But Candy is weak in his role, leaving much of his talent by the wayside... again maybe because of his death and scene cutting. I never cared for Richard Lewis and he is just as weak as Candy in this film. The price is right and the editing, photography, and supporting cast make it a worthwhile purchase. The film was poorly written, but comes out as a C+ film overall on DVD."
1,Wagon's Least,"John Candy was one of my favorite comediens, but even he couldn't pull this one out of the trash.It was silly to the point of being stupid."
3,Not so awful...but jinxed.,"I've heard that any movie in which the star dies during filming will be ""jinxed""; that is, people will lambaste it. ""Wagons East"" is a perfect example of this phenomenon. I'm not sure why I decided to watch this film after all I'd heard about it...but, for some reason, I did.And what did I find? Not a horrible movie...but what *could* have actually been a *good* movie (among other things, it's based on actual events-settlers *did* often decide to return east), made mediocre by the fact that the footage filmed after John Candy's death was so easy to spot. And some of the anachronistic humor (including the very presence of the Richard Lewis character), admittedly, did not help.But there were quite a few good laughs. The gay guy turning out to be a masterful gunslinger comes to mind. And the scuzzy Ferguson brothers (even the most distinctive of them made unrecognizable by blank expressions and layers of filth) were hilarious."
3,supporting actors run the show,"The only thing worth watching in this movie is John C. McGinley who plays Julian, the bookstore owner."
5,Wagons East,Great John Candy movie. Silly and lots of fun and laughter. This movie will remind you what a fun loving guy he was.
4,Fun. Makes one think about diversity.,"Love it. It is not a Candy movie - it's the whole cast movie. Not a runaway hit, but will stick in family references, like barefoot moccasins, ""ok, pumpkin"", ""landed on a barrel cactus"", etc... Watch with pre-teens, lighthearted way to discuss things - from mail brides tradition, to country history, to field surgery, and more."
1,ugh,This is a terrible film. I actually had to sit through this stink bomb in a theater! I'm very angry that I paid money to see this God awful film. Aren't comedies supposed to be funny? I couldn't wait for it to be over. Please do not waste your time or money buying this horrible movie. (...)
4,Funny!,"I was really pleased with this movie. It had lots of funny parts, and I think that if you like comedy, you should watch it."
3,A Good way to kill two hours,"The movie itself isn't bad. If you like Blazing Saddles you'll like this. It is the picture quality that fails this film. This is not in HD. It is a blown up version of a full-screen DVD. It's blurry to a fault, so much so that even though my family stuck with it I left since i have seen it before. Summary: Good movie, lousy picture."
3,Good overview of the English Civil War,"I well understand some of the reviewers' complaints about this book's cursory treatment of various subjects relating to the war, its causes and its primary characters. However, the author himself acknowledges that his book is a mere overview, meant for the reader who is unfamiliar with the war. He seems exhaustive though in at least listing all the various battles and sieges, and certainly emphasizes the constant depredations committed by both sides."
2,Unreal 2 - the Boring,"I'll keep it short - very linear gameplay, predictable, and BORING. If you liked Unreal, which I did, this will most likely be a disappointment. I particulary object to the numerous arcade-style stand-there-and-shoot-the-little-things-coming-at-you scenes. Figuring out what to do next or where to go is trivial; you usually have no choices at all.Aside from the poor gameplay, I had several very annoying technical glitches, even though my hardware was on the 'approved' list and I was using the latest drivers (ATI Radeon). I spent hours fiddling with game rendering parameters until I found a set that worked consistently.In summary, sorry I bought it."
4,Decent game...great graphics,"I don't know why all of these reviewers are bagging on this game. True, it's nothing original, and it's linear. But you could say the same thing about 95% of the FPS games on PC.The graphics are the best I've seen. A cutting-edge system makes them look all the better.The sci-fi worlds are very immersive and beautiful. Lots of cool structures, scenery and creatures. The game is a great escape from the world of work and/or wife.I paid 40 bucks for the game and got about 15 hours of entertainment out of it. Pretty good - less than three dollars an hour (a movie is two to three times that much).If you like FPS and science fiction type games, by all means, buy Unreal II. It's a good game."
2,Too many crashes,"It crashes too frequently and made me disappointed.Load/save takes about 1-2 minutes on 2.4G machinewith 1.5G ram and 256M video, that is a shame!Sound is bad. It changes from loud to quiet and back withoutany respect to the content.I don't have any of that problems on my machine with Half-Life or StarWars Jedi Knight II....Probably you can buy it to get some fun in between of crashes,or trust that they will be able to fix it."
2,Beauty with no brains,"Awesome graphics but no real content. The gameplay and story are just a recycled mishmash of other fps titles. Aside from the eye candy, there is nothing innovative or memorable here at all. It should have been half price at most."
3,An ok title,"Unreal 2 is definitely a downgrade from the original Unreal.Besides the great scenery, great graphics and game engine there isn't much to this game. The storyline lacks depth and it fails to immerse the player. If you see this title in the bargain bin then maybe you should pick it up. Otherwise I wouldn't pay the money for it. There's a lot of other great single player fps titles out there. Unreal 2 I feel that is not worth to be the successor of the Unreal franchise."
2,What ever happened to Unreal?,"I cannot say i have ever felt so dissapointed with a game before. This game does not resemble the original unreal at all. It is appaling. The only reason it got 2 stars is cos against other games its OK. See for urself but i warn anyone who has played any other unreal game - JUST BECAUSE IT CONTAINS THE WORD ""UNREAL"" DOES NOT MEAN THAT IT IS GOOD. You have been warned."
2,Nothing like the GOTY edition,"I was hoping for an upgraded version of the Game of the Year edition, but was greatly disappointed. While the graphics are decent, and some may like the SLOW introduction, it stayed on my computer only a short while ..... I'd much rather play the older version."
2,"It's Unreal ""Too"", but not for the right reasons...","The original Unreal combined cutting-edge graphics with expansive levels, great attention to detail, good AI, excellent gameplay, a decent story, a variety of ""enemies"", and hours of entertainment. It was ""Unreal"" in a good way compared to the standard of the day. Unreal set a new high standard for the genre.Unreal 2 has excellent graphics (as expected), little attention to detail (barely any environmental interaction is possible), mediocre AI (even by the original Unreal's standard), [bad] gameplay, a boring and contrived storyline, little character variety, and about 4-10 hours of entertainment depending on your level of skill. Unreal 2 doesn't bring anything new or particularly impressive to the gaming world.My advice, take a pass on it, unless you can get it for a substantial discount."
2,Over Hyped,"Over Hyped? I think so. The graphics are not that good, the frame rate is quite low. I've seen similar (and much older) games that have better visuals, Half Life is one for example. Even on my AMD 1800XP and nVidia GeForce 3 Ti500 Unreal II is barely playable. As for audio, the effects are okay, but the voice ""acting"" is very poor. I played the game for an hour or so and came away feeling that I've seen it all before, just done much better. No need for this one, wait for something better."
1,"Beat it in five hours, what a waste!","This is a really odd game. First of all, there isn't any dodge, a staple of FPS's since for ever. Secondly, it's really really slow, it's like one of those bad dreams where you are trying to run and...Unreal 2 has no run.The story is un-engaging, the script is poor, the maps are linear. The whole feeling is one of claustrophobia and ""why did I waste my money on this mess?""I beat this in one evening and there is NO re-play value."
1,Can't play at all--crashes three different computers,"Be warned: I can't get past the initial screen on three different high-end computers--the game crashes with no useful information. I've wasted lots of time updating various drivers (and I'm generally knowledgable about PCs). To judge from the included help files, many problems seem to be caused by very aggressive CD copy protection (you're even supposed to update your cd-rom drivers in some cases--what a waste of time!). If I'd known about these problems, I would never have considered purchasing this game."
2,Unreal 1:Good. Unreal 2:Bad,"Back in the old days when the original Unreal came out, there was nothing else I would play. The graphics (for that time) were great, the enemies were fresh and original, and there was no stupid dialogue to bore you to the extent of not wanting to play the game. And it had a wide open door for a sequel, so I was excited about this. Then along comes a digital blob of sacrelige. The graphics are fantastic, but it's not fun killing a bunch of boring space marines, and killing the Skaarj that now look like elephants crossed with a giant T-Rex. The dialogue is bad, folks, and I mean BAD. I just don't want to talk to an alien that looks like a 50's jukebox and full or radioactive semen, or a grungy mechanic who tells you who to use a pistol and smokes incessantly, or the world's greatest strategist who looks like some sort of whore. All in all, the game sucks. If they make an Unreal 3, it better be like the original: fresh, new, and exciting."
4,Great Game for testing your machine,"...And that is exactly why I bought this overpriced shooter. It looks great and plays fine on my machine; but I have a high-powered mobo, a high-powered P4 processor and 1GB of RAM. People grumbling about this games performance should have read the requirements before purchasing it; they warn you that Unreal 2 is ""optimized"" for a P4 1Ghz processor. The ""minimum"" requirements are a joke! However, I did get the GPF when I enabled EAX sound - KA-BLOOEY!! - but I restarted Unreal 2 without re-booting my PC.In my opinion, this is just the prototype of games to come, just like the first Unreal game. I'll enjoy playing with this one until more engrossing Unreal 2-based games come out."
3,"Ok, but could have been more","Just finished the game, and have to say I was dissapointed overall. The graphics on a few of the levels were stunning, but on many of the other levels the graphics weren't that much better then in Unreal. The game did not allow you much chance for exploration; there was generally only one way to solve a problem. At several points through the game, I felt it lacked imagination.After playing Deux Ex(which uses the Unreal game engine), I though Deux Ex was a much better game overall. I didn't have any problem with frame rate on my computer, and I had all the goodies turned on. I have a 1.4G computer with 1G ram with a GeeForce 3 video card.Overall, the game had it's moments and I'm not sorry I bought it, but it could have been so much more. Next I'll need to play with their editor..."
2,Mediocrity at its best,"Great graphics, but like so many games in the FPS genre, the story is banal, uninspired, and generally unworthy of the programmers who made the engine. This linear game never drew me into it...I felt that I was just running around shooting things. That may be fun enough for some people, but considering the hundreds of titles and _free_ mods that are at least as fun for the occassional frag fest, it just doesn't make sense to drop $ on this one.Half-Life, System Shock 2, and Homeworld are all games that, unlike Unreal2, transport you to their world for a little while, making you a major character in a living plot. Unreal 2, my friends, is no Half-Life. It has better graphics, but it is less fun. If you aren't looking for something just to show off your new graphics card, I suggest you look elsewhere."
2,urge to write scathing letter to Epic... rising!,"Unreal 2 is a mediocre at best. I never played the first game, so I came to Unreal 2 with virtually nothing except for my expectations from a few small previews. I was shocked and appaled. although the graphics engine is awesome, the game just sucks. the AI is serviceable, but lacks anything close to Half-Life's, which is more like the behavior of a real creature. there is a nice variety of weapons, but though they are admittedly cool, they are USELESS. all you really need is your futuristic magnum and assult rifle to beat the game. this game is about as bland as you can get. the character design is uninspired, going basically like: take normal earth animal. make bigger. add claws and other implements of destruction. and Perfecto! only one enemy actually has any uniqueness, but its also too hard to consider fun fighting"
2,Game dose not look right,"When I played this game on my Computer, it just did not look right(Fram rate) . The game play itself seemed alright.I have played much newer games on my computer like Fallout 3 without any issues. I must admit I like the first Unreal better."
1,data3.cab corruption on disc 2,"I wish I could say how great this game is but I can't even install it. There are 2 discs for installation. The first disc will install without a hitch. The second disc, however, has a corrupt file on it (data3.cab) and cannot be read/copied no matter what you try. Thus, the installation will fail every time. Buyer beware about this one... not worth the headache."
4,"Not exactly ""Unreal"" but...","I never liked those online tournament style games, I prefer something with a bit of a story. This one's got it all. If you found the first Unreal pretty but a bit boring, then you're in for a pleasant surprise. This one is much prettier, and has an actual story!"
5,Absolutely Brilliant,"This has to be one of the best games I've ever played! Exciting, challenging, great flow,story line, etc. and as good as Halo. Expect hours of fast action entertainment with this title."
3,Unreal 2 marches to the beat of a different drummer...,"Although I salute the late Legend Entertainment for offering a departure title in the Unreal franchise, I must admit I am disappointed by the offering. Unreal had a successful, enjoyable formula. If that formula could have somehow been infused with the beautiful graphics/music and fun combat system featured in Unreal 2, Legend would have had a runaway hit.Unfortunately, that is not the case. Unreal 2 felt too much like it's own, unique deal... which, I suppose would have been fine, had the game not been promising a SEQUEL to Unreal. This is what happens when you have an ambitious developer handle a popular franchise with a publisher imposed deadline under the burden of thousands of fans' grand expectations.I bought Unreal 2 and I was glad I did, but I'm anxiously awaiting Unreal 3 to give me some satisfaction... the Unreal way."
2,not worth the money,"This game does have some great graphics, but there is a HUGE lack of game-play. All the missions are short and linear, there's only one way to do anything. Like a previous reviewer said, you go along a path, kill some people, then run to the objective. There's only one path to take, you cannot get lost or take neat side-trips, you do it the one way or no way.The weapons are kinda neat, but you cannot effectively use but 2-3 of them to get anywhere. The baddies always do the same thing, attack the same way.And you can EASILY finish the game in about 10 hours the first time. Then you can finish in about half that time from then on. Someone got lazy when then designed this game.When the price drops [lower] in the bargain bin, THEN you should think about buying this game."
5,Buy it for XMP,The free downloadable multiplayer portion of this game called XMP is worth twice as much as what they are asking. It's highly addictive and great fun. I haven't even bothered witht he single player yet. If you like mulitplayer this is a must have.
2,Dont expect it to be a sequel,"Unreal was a great game, Unreal 2 isnt. Three or four levels are good but the game as a whole is not worth the short amount of time it takes to play it. Very disapointing!"
1,...,"if you loved unreal tournament,don't buy this game. thay have taken a first class deathmatch game and turned it into a ... duke nukem type game. when will these nurds learn to stop messing up a good thing?"
3,Huh... that was intresting...,"After all the Multi-player versions that came out, Unreal universe is exspanded again in a new single player Adventure. This time with voice acting and facial Posing. NEAT...Still the game even on it Hardest Settig was way to easy for me in the first run through. and was way too short for my taist. then again it was still long.The weapons where balanced fairly well, lots of nice features. had a fairly intresting story and an intresting Slant.Still it dissapointed me. fun but nothing really new..."
2,Great Graphics? Not!,"I don't understand why everybody puts in the obligatory ""stunning graphics""; the fact of the matter is this game is just ugly. I bought this game hoping that it would look as good as Unreal Tournament 2003, but it's not even close. What's worse, it requires you to have twice as powerful a machine (as UT2003) to look at muddy enviroments with no sense of color theory. The graphics are okay, but hardly ""beautiful""; its more of a disappointment because of all the hype about the new ""engine"". The visuals are as good as any other game out there, but they should have been better. (And no, it's not my system: just look at the screenshots at unreal2.com).The fact is, the Unreal Tournament games looked better, and were more fun to play. Designers need to stop thinking just in terms of detailed textures, and think about visual appeal. Lessons could be learned from art school graduates; games need the same level of graphic professionalism as movies (disney, pixar, lucasfilm)."
3,Unreal II: The Awakening,"I loved the orginal Unreal and it's mission pack Return to Napali. They are one of the most beautifull games i ever played. Unreal 2 is a good game but not good enough for an Unreal sequel. The orginal Unreal deserves more than this. The gameplay is quite linear, a little short with no multiplayer. Ofcouse it has a good story while the previous game did not but the gameplay here is not that great. The weapons are large and look strange with not so great effects. It's the future, futuristic weapons should be smaller with better effects. Powered by the latest version of the unreal engine the graphics are great with beautifull skies but there are no mirrors or cool reflective surfaces. Fire effects and the flame thrower are really well done. Unreal had beautifull and large levels, Here the levels are very small not that well desinged. You will be watching the loading screen frequently. Unreal 2 is just an average shooter."
4,Great game,"this game is a lot of fun. the graphics are a pleaser, and the gameplay and story keep you hooked. The weapons are an absolute blast, very innovative and cool looking. It suits a few different types of players, as well. if you're into stealth; sniping off a few and then cleaning up the rest, you get some missions for that. if you like to go in guns a blazing, you get some missions for that, too. the missions are very varied and it keeps the game fresh and interesting. the story is Very suspenseful. The only thing that keeps this game from 5 stars is a) it's pretty linear, and b) there's no incentive to go back and beat it again. still, worth you money."
2,Superb graphics & sound but bland plot,"I was really looking forward to the release of Unreal 2, and bought it almost immediately when it came out in the stores. I was blown away by the graphics and sound. However, within a week or so, I was done with it. The plot is hackneyed and linear, and the game seems a bit too short. This wouldn't be so bad if it had good multiplayer, but there is actually NO multiplayer. I played it through a second time and then sold it. I'd recommend Raven Shield, the new Tom Clancy shooter, as it uses the same superb game engine as Unreal 2 but includes great multiplayer."
3,dissapointing: zero replay value,"After playing the game all the way through, all puzzles are solved, all mysteries are revealed, all AI opponents strategies are cracked and countered. Pretty game, but ZERO replay value. Buy Unreal Tournament 2003 instead: when patched up to the most current patch level, it's a blast of a game with infinite replayability."
4,Feh.,"They tried real hard. Maybe too hard. Over-written commentary, over-polished graphics, and an occasionnal feeling that they forgot how incredible the first game was. It's pretty, and it has some wonderful elements. But, it just doesn't jump out at you and knock you over like the original did. I did have some fun with the game. It was just too formulaic. No replay value at all for me."
3,An ok game.,"I remember reading reviews about how this game was gonna save gaming. Whatever! Great graphics? Yes. Solid Gameplay and control? Yes. Good story? Yes. Multiplay and depth? NO.The game was too short and no multiplayer (although they have released it free from what I hear on the internet and are selling a newer version of this game with multiplay included), but it is too late for me.I loved the graphics and enjoyed the characters and the enemies were all very cool, but this game is not even close to saving gaming. That will be the job of Half-Life 2 and Doom 3.For the price this game is selling at now, it would be a worthy buy.I Payed full price expecting more, and when I found out there was no multiplay, I knew I wasted my money. Oh well. Life goes on."
1,not satisfied,I could not continue taking the product. 4 pills that large is to many to take and it upset my stomach. I threw the product away. I chose this product after reading the review on a large choice of bone supplements.
1,Not as rated,"After taking the product exactly as directed, I have found no change in the flexability or pain levels in my knees."
4,Best product I have ever used for my arthritis,I have used many different Glucosamines and Chondroitins and none of them ever worked.I started this product almost a year ago and it has made a world of difference. I panic when the bottle is half empty I reorder so not to run out.I hope it continues to help.
3,"Great Textbook, CDs not Mac compatible","I am just barely begining to use this textbook in my speech pathology courses, but I do have one major complaint. The software, Anatesse, and studywares are not mac compatible. I was able to get the studywares cd to work on my mac by testing it out on a trial version of crossover mac, but the anatesse only shows the uninstall file..... Very annoying. No where on any of the info does it say what operating system is required. In addition on of my classmates is having issues running it on vista as well.... Fortunatly Seikel the main author is the head of the department I am in so I will be able to complain to someone....."
5,Wonderful condition. Extremely pleased customer!,"The book arrived promptly and in better condition then I had anticipated. I am very pleased with this purchase and grateful because of the importance of this text for my college career.Thanks, PMT"
2,Unfortunate,"I used the third edition of this text in my undergraduate Anatomy & Physiology of Speech and Hearing class. At the time I really liked the book. It is easy to read and for the most part comprehend. Now that I am in graduate school for Speech Pathology, I was told by a professor that the book is very inaccurate. She stated that it was one of the worst Anatomy and Physiology books out for Speech and Hearing. She also mentioned that I would not be able to use it as a reference in any papers or research, due to the poor quality of the material. This is really unfortunate because, like I said earlier, I really liked the book.I do not recommend purchasing this text. If you are a future SLP, there are better resources out there with less errors."
3,"Mongo, voodoo, CIA and Republicans: They're all in this book","Not Chesbro's best Mongo book, but anyMongo adventure is a good read (at leastfor me). Substitute 1997 U.S.Congress and its majority leader intothe political references, add recentheadlines of dubious CIA activities,mix in voodoo, violent, gory deaths,and stir with Mongo and bother Garthin some near-death experiences.The result is paranoia, politicsand adventure (not necessarily inthat order)."

1,Tripping over his political paranoia again...,"I've generally loved Chesbro's books, but in this one and in the Language of Cannibals, he prefers to launch political diatribes rather than worry about telling a story. Whether you agree or not with his left wing tirades that turn aging hippies and former communists into heroes (as in Cannibals), if you're fair and objective, you'll agree that his eagerness to make a point interferes with his normal storytelling prowess, and his paranoia becomes a Johnny-one-note theme. The entire plot, from the opening sentence, is a long, paranoid tirade. Read some of the finer books in this series like Rings, Shadow of a Broken Man, etc."
1,Incorrect version,"I too found this was not the newer version as advertised. Hopefully I am getting my money back, but be extra careful if you order. Scrabble is a great game, and if they can actually guarantee you're getting the correct new version, hopefully it will be great. I'm waiting to see..."
1,Scrabble,Website says the game runs on platform 95/98/ME but the program says 3.1/95. My system runs on ME and when you play the game you have to reset your colors to 256 and change them back again when you finish playing. Not worth the trouble.
1,"Incorrect version, False Advertising","I purchased the Scrabble/Boggle combiniation and never got it to work on my Win98 computer. Kept getting error messages. Wish I would have read the reviews before purchasing. This is the version for Win95, not Win98 as stated in the ad..."
1,Bad Battery,"I received this ""new"" battery and immediately charged it overnight. Surprisingly, when the unit was turned on after charging, the low battery warning still illuminated. After three attempts to disconnect the battery, fully discharge, and fully re-charge the battery, it actually performs no better than the 19 year old factory battery that came with my iCom IC-A21 radio that I bought in 1990. Nice customer support and great price. Too bad the last two pluses don't match the product quality."
2,Very Disappointed!,I spent so much time searching for a food set that my little girl would love and would be a better value than other sets I have seen. I read the reviews and most of the people loved the product so I took a chance. This food set came today and I was so mad at myself for ordering it. You pay way too much for what you are getting in the set. If I was to do this again I would order the Melissa and Doug sets instead. This set is a huge joke for $50.00!
5,Extremely satisfied,"For Christmas, I bought my daughter a kitchen. However, it came with only 4 or 5 pieces of fake food. I saw this and decided for the price, I had nothing to lose. Even though there wasn't a picture, I decided to go ahead and pick it up. I'm so glad I did and my daughter is too. You get 3 different baskets divided into separate courses: breakfast, lunch, dinner. They baskets are a great size and have a handle so they can be carried around. They're like the baskets you can carrry at the supermarket. There are approcimately 11-14 pieces of food in each basket for example, a fried egg, pancake, bowl of strawberries, sandwich, burger, corn, peas, potatoes, bread, steak, chips, cake etc. What I like the best is there aren't any cardboard boxes which get destroyed easily. All in all, it is a very good value and I am very satisfied."
4,My toddler enjoys it.,"My 2 year-old thinks the food is fun! He loves to pretend eat, the life-like strawberries are a big hit, as are the lettuce leaves. I am a little disappointed though. I guess I thought 44 pieces would be a lot more. I don't know that I got my ""moneys-worth""."
3,"good, but too expensive","my daughter loves to make her fake food but i just think it was overpriced. wish i would have bought a smaller batch of fake food, which would be just as fun and save a little bit of money"
4,Great foods,"My two year old daughter loves making us our meals with this food. I did receive all 44 pieces but when you take all the pieces out of the wrapping, looks are deceiving. I also received one yellow and two blue baskets. I am completely okay with that but if you expecting to receive all three different colors, you may not."
4,Very nice realistic looking quality play food,"Just bought this for Christmas for my 3 year old granddaughter along with the Learning Resources Pretend and Play Dish set. She loves playing with it, dishing out food for everyone. I shopped around for other 'cheaper priced' play food sets and couldn't find anything else that I thought actually looked like the food it was supposed to be. The other sets looked cheaply made. I'm very happy with the quality of this set and how realistic the food looks and its' distinct colors. I can't however, give it 5 stars because I thought it was way overpriced."
4,Very nice,Very nice packaging and the food looks realistic. So much so my little girl keeps trying to eat the bacon. Didn't see any instructions due it being a Santa present but hopefully they recommed rising/washing the food. The little baskets are also very handy.
2,DEATH IN A STRANGE COUNTRY,I HAD REQUESTED A NON-LIBRARY NOT REMAINDERED COPY OF THIS BOOK AND SENT AN E-MAIL TO AWESOME BOOKS IN ENGLAND. THE BOOK ARRIVED AND THE BOOK WAS AN EX LIBRARY COPY OF THE BOOK. NEEDLESS TO SAY I WAS LESS THAN SATISFIED. HOWEVER I DECIDED THAT IT WAS GOING TO BE A HASSLE TO RETURN THE BOOK SO I'M JUSTING CUTTING MY LOSSES BUT WILL NOT ORDER A BOOK FROM AWESOME AGAIN.
4,Venice Revealed,"While this is not my favorite of the series, I have become fond of Brunetti and his love for corrupt and decadent Venice and his family. The mystery is almost secondary to his character and his views of the city and Leon's charaters are a delight."
4,Guido Brunetti - my newfound hero!,"I love mystery stories and once I find an author I enjoy, I read all of his/her books. I am looking forward to reading all of Donna Leon's series. Commissario Brunetti is a real person, compassionate, funny, interesting, devious when necessary, etc. The story is well written with lots of little plots and twists mixed in with family situations and wonderful descriptions of Venice. the book held me until I finished it. On to the next one - if I can find it!"
4,Delightful Italian Police Procedural Mystery,"The combination of a little social commentary, hilarious dialogue, suspense, and interesting characters made this a very entertaining read. If you already know Donna Leon, you won't be disappointed. If you don't and you like intelligent mysteries, give this a try."
2,Trite and bromide ridden,"The turgid narrative flow was constantly jolted by clichés, characters never ""did"" but ""seemed to..."" I don't have the time to go into detail, but I'read 2 and no more. Compare with The superb translations on Andrea Camilleri's Commissario Montalbano, whose wit, ingenuity and hugely readable novels are a delight...can't wait for the new arrivals!"
3,Death in a Strange Country,"I enjoy reading the Brunetti ""cozy mysteries"" as well as many others. They are always enjoyable and so was this one."
3,A Celebration of African Masks,"A wonderful book filled with great photographs and well wirtten text. Photographs illistrated, to allow the viewer to see every detail of each mask. A very informative book, almost like a museum tour, with the exception that the viewer will never see as many examples of African Masks in one place at one time. 100% Satisfaction"
5,Wonderful detailed pictures of amazing masks,"This is another wonderful book if you're interested about african masks. The pictures - they are plenty - are amazing. Some examples are even very rare to find in other publications (see Senegal, Guinea Bissau, Tanzania sections). This is mainly a photographic book, but there are some right informations at the end of the book about each mask. I bought this book to know how to recognize a surface of an ancient mask from a modern (or even fake) one, and I'm fully satisfied. The images are detailed enough to see very well even the most hidden part of the mask. A very good purchase."
4,Spirits Speak: A Celebrationmof African Mask,A very nice book on Afican mask and statues. Great photos and nice information on the mask how they were used and what cultures used them. Beautiful photographs through out the book. One of the highlights is the map in the back of the book of the different tribes where the art comes from. I would reccommend this book to anyone interested in African Art.Lonnie McCaskillExpedition Cargo
3,"Spirits speak - big pictures, little information","I was looking for more in-depth information than was provided. It claims to be a superlative collection of the very best examples, but tells us little about the artwork and the selections are aesthetically arbitrary. A different smaller book,""African Masks"" has many of the same pictures, is just as photographically comprehensive, and much more informative. This large book is redundant, but I suppose it is a nice coffee table book. I would rather have the space."
5,Excellent quality soap!,"Yardley English Lavender French milled soap has a true lavender fragrance and makes a very nice lather. The bar lasts quite some time and it will last even longer if it is aged for a few months prior to use (although it will lose some of the smell) so I usually unwrap it and place it in my dresser drawers and linen closet where it gives a clean, delicate scent to the items stored there.Not only is this a good quality soap, it is readily available and is much less expensive than soap of similar quality imported from Europe. The English Rose and and especially the Lemon Verbena scents are also quite nice but the lavender remains my favorite. If you have stuck with Ivory and have never used a French milled soap, give this a try. Highly recommended."
5,very pleased,These CDs were a gift and the recipient is very pleased with them. They were priced right and arrived in a timely manner.
5,The Fun of Travel in a Very Funny Manner,"I think my title pretty much sums up my view of this book -- it presents, in a very user-friendly format, an irreverent trip around the globe by people who obviously know how to travel and apparently have a great deal of fun doing it....the way they describe some of the places and events makes you just want to drop your mouse, shut off your PC and go out and explore the craziness that is out there that they describe in such a humorous fashion. Dave and Neil, I feel like I know them & have traveled with them after reading their book, can have me as a travel companion anytime they wish.Order it now and you'll appreciate what I'm saying about this delightful book."
5,Great read,The authors were the first guys to write this type of book. Great concept and read. Travel events for near and far
4,LET'S ROLL,"A fun, adventuresome book with good ideas. I'm combining this with ""A 1000 places to see before you die - USA and Canada,"" and will never run out of ideas for just about any kind of vacation. This book is great for highlighting some of the world's great events like the Dakar Rally, Incwala, Ganesh Chaturhi, Housen Matsuri, Great Singsing at Mt. Hagen or the the Mangum Rattlesnake Rally, or maybe the Testicle Festival. Curious yet? This book gives a clear explanation of of what to do and see in the USA, Canada, Latin America, the Caribbean, Europe, Asia and Africa, and rough dates and where to contact for details. I liked the outlines and recommend it to any world traveler, or just stay at home in the USA or Canada; there's plenty to do. You won't be bored!"
4,Interesting,It is interesting to know things like these are going on in the world. I definately plan on attending some of the events in the book.
1,An Embarrassment,"When I saw that Robert Sheaffer, who has also written on UFO claims, had written a book on Jesus, I was excited. I thought he might analyze the claims made about Jesus in light of his knowledge of extraordinary claims made today.He does - briefly - but otherwise, a theme that could have been his strongest point gets largely left to the side. Instead, he relies largely on the assumption that the Toldoth Jesu, a fourth-century Talmudic work, can provide us with facts about Jesus not recorded in the Gospels. The book's sole strong point is that he provides a summary of the Toldoth, which shows its obviously mythic character and makes for entertaining reading besides. Let me emphasize that I think the historical Gospels are none too reliable, but the Toldoth is certainly less so."
3,Leonardo,"This video is not as good as other videos in this series. My older kids like it, but the younger ones find it a little boring."
5,Not just for Halloween,"This is a wonderful book for the creative spirit or crafty mom. Instead of spending your hard earned cash on flimsy costumes that may get only one wear, you can make your own. It includes a multitude of colorful photos and easy to follow, step-by-step instructions to make many exciting and unique costumes. Some of them include: a king, robot, knight in shining armour, magician, cowboy and hula girl. This would be a great book to use for Halloween costumes as well as for dress up and role play. Many of the costumes can be made by kids themselves. It will save you money and the kids will have a great time."
3,Not inspiring,"The book contains great illustrations and instructions to create several costumes, but we were uninspired to create anything from the book or based on the book. I was looking for more inspiration, tips and tricks to create other costumes. This book wasn't what I sought."
5,Please release in DVD format!!!,"This is a great classic film based an a classic play with incredible characters, endearing plot and a wonderful performance by Bette Davis playing a beloved character. I don't understand why this film has not been released as a DVD. It is a charming story with a restrained and very effective performance by Bette Davis. I saw this films many years ago on TV and used to own the VHS. The film is very memorable and I hope someday to have the DVD. There are lesser Bette Davis movies on DVD, so why not release this great one!"
1,Close to being a scam!,"Look elsewhere is my best advice. Even if you don't connect with your party, just dialing and ringing uses minutes very quickly!!! 10 seconds of ringing could cost you 5 or 6 minutes. It's a RIPOFF. Buyer beware!"
1,Not The Silent Movie.,Do not buy this video if you are expecting to get receive silent movie. It's not!
2,THE COVER LOOKS BETTER THAN THE CONTENTS,"Bought the DVD of the first and second seasons and discovered that the cover looks better than the contents. The shows are all there and unedited, but there are several missing features. No commentary, no facts about the show, and you can't even make scene selections. Once you start the episode, you get the whole thing as one single cut. Also, there is something not right about the video quality. I know the show was originally shot on videotape (early 70's at that) but something funky happened to the picture once transferred to the DVD. All in all, you will be able to relive these episodes, but you get a lot less for the money than similar products."
3,How could they mess up perfection?,"Let me say if I were to review the comedy alone contained within, this gets 6 stars, however this is a boxset and factoring that in, this is dismal. Every mistake in the book is here as far as how NOT to bring a classic series to dvd.No Chapter Skips? Check.No pilot? Check.Poor transfer? Check.Flimsy, awkward, (though nice looking) packaging? Check.No remastered sound? Check.No extras? Check.I have a majority of these on the official Columbia House VHS series, and somehow the picture on those tends to be marginally better. Who woulda thought you could mess up perfection? The picture is sort of fuzzy, and every now and again you can see some digital imperfection. I am satisfied with the set because it is a space saver, but thats about it (other than the obvious quality of the perfomances). Why even take the time to bring these to dvd, then cut every corner in the book? Will I buy season 2? You betcha."
4,All In The Family Review,"The only thing I don't like about the DVD's is they don't have the first episode on them. Why not? That's the one we most wanted. Otherwise, we're enjoying the other episodes. Please let me know if there's a way I can get the first episode, at no charge. Thank you!"
5,ALL IN THE FAMILY DVD IT'S A GREAT ONE.,THE DVD ALL IN THE FAMILY IS VERY GOOD.. I WATCH IT ON MY DVD PLAYER WHEN ALL IN THE FAMILY IS NOT ON NICK AT NIGHT. IT'S GREAT. I WOULD TELL PEOPLE IF THEY LOVE ALL IN THE FAMILY TO GET IT! I AM WAITING FOR MORE TO COME OUT ON DVD..
5,Show topics still current today,"If you loved this show when it first aired, you will enjoy revisiting the Bunker clan.How strange how issues back in the early 1970's resemble current issues...Great show if you can relate to Archie and DingBat"
5,Brings back memories,"Remembering the days of the late and middle 70's, this is a reminder for some of us the way the world was at that time and the mentality of people like Archie Bunker. And, also a reminder of what a great actor Acrroll O'Connor was. I love this series and would recommend it to anyone."
2,Happy Shows are Different Now,"When All in the Family was on, it was a good show, but it was so succesful that its formula became the staple of TV for decades. Unfortunatly the formula which was basically questioning ""old wisdom"" and adding a brief serious ""turn"" to the script wears thin quickly.If you like shows like Cheers, Frasier, and Curb Your Enthusium, then you probably shouldn't spend the money for this."
3,Not a great value,"This set is expensive considering you only get 13 shows. Quality is amazingly good considering what these shows were shot at, but I see some serious fringing at the edges of the frame. Wish there were more shows in a set at this price."
3,Not Really Complete,"I bought all 6 seasons and only disappointed because they are NOT really complete! On all 3 discs the first few original episodes are not there. I thought it would be a complete run of the entire series, but they skip around and some are missing. Now don't get me wrong, if your a die hard like I am, they are still worth the purchase and it's heaven not having the commercials but the series ""is not really complete"".Still worth the purchase!"
4,"Thanks, and PLEASE keep the seasons coming!","What a thrill to have the first season of this pioneering TV classic on DVD. This is a true TV landmark, and the performances of the four incredible principals are even more impressive when seen today...truly classic TV. PLEASE keep the sets coming! There are dozens and dozens of timeless classic episodes in the seasons to come!"
3,Interesting fact,"If people like this they should check out the english t.v programme till death do us part, because all in the family copied and based the us hiot show no the english show till death do us part, like a lot of american t.v it was first started in england, so check out the original because its much better"
2,Fair,"Well, it goes without saying that ""All In The Family"" was a great show for it's first five seasons. But what I don't understand is why the video and audio quality of these DVD's is so inferior to the quality of the VHS issues. I have the VHS, a friend bought these on DVD. I thought DVD's were supposed to be better? But at the price Amazon is selling these for, still you can't go wrong. I asked around about this and was told it was in the transfer. All DVD's you buy say ""digitally remastered"" and that is meaningless.All that means is that is was put onto a digital formatted DVD. What to look for is ""restored masters"", meaning that before it was transferred to DVD (or VHS), the master tapes were restored and usually the audio was enhanced with dolby stereo. These lack that but as I said, for this low price, it's still okay."
2,Only one real reason to buy this disc...LOVE TEMPO!!!,"The 12"" version of Love Tempo, clocking in at 7:55, is finally on CD. Sound quality is excellent. I'd never heard any other songs by Quando Quango, but it really isn't anything special, and becomes boring quite quickly. A couple of songs have a ""new wave 80s"" feel, but most of the tracks are repetitive and uninteresting. Nothing on here is a lost 80s gem. Too bad Love Tempo didn't show up on an 80s compilation so I wouldn't have to own this whole disc for one song...."
5,BIBLE for TODAY'S FAMILY,"Easy reading but be aware that this bible doesn't contain any of the Old Testament. The text near bottom of image (and not clearly visible) says ""NEW TESTAMENT with PSALMS and PROVERBS""."
4,"Light, fun to read, and fascinating.","I just finished Enchanted Evening, and I liked it as much as I've liked all of M. M. Kaye's work. Although not well off financially, she and her family lived in India and China during what seemed like a fun period for women of the English upper classes -- not much to do besides attend parties, travel to exotic locales, and search for a suitable husband. Her stories of the good times she had, plus how she began to support herself with her art and with writing, were a very welcome distraction to me. I am looking forward to reading the next one."
4,Enchanted Evening,"LOVED it!!!! I enjoyed everything Ms. Kaye wrote about India and that includes her three volume autobiography. It is a shame that she started this books so late and never gave us the rest of her amazing life: back to the UK, traveling with her husband through the 1950s and 60s when she wrote her ""Death in...."" series. So many things her fans would have liked to know."
1,Where the Rubber Leaves the Road,"Rarely have I read a book that makes less sense. A woman with a cockney accent makes fun of the upper classes by trying to imitate their speech. Yet, in a trice, she is part of that establishment. You would think that a big-name banker and his two daughters have better things to do than to take this wooly aluminum welder into their hearth and home. And Sebastian surely did not wait for this dishevelled creature to fill his bed. WHOLLY AND ABSOLUTELY UNBELIEVABLE."
2,"Slow moving, unbelievable and boring",Very little happens in this book. It is boring and pointless. The story is highly unbelievable too.
4,The Amazing Sam Jones,"A mystery-detective novel that will leave you not only wanting more of the same, but many many more Sam Jones novels. She is strong, beautiful, smart and fashion conscience. A page turner for all."
2,Not in German,"I was excited to find this import, thinking most of the songs would be in German because all of the song titles are in German. While the packaging is in German, the songs are in English. I was really hoping to get Shock den Affen in German! Big disappointment!"
2,Drains Quickly,"Initially worked fine with adequate endurance. After a few charges, noticed the unit becoming inflated and would hold the charge for much shorter time (# of pictures)."
1,Poor Support For Known errors!,"I am currently working on Chapter 3 of this book. The book instructs you to create a lot of very cool things. In chapter 3 you work on building a hierarchical menu utilizing arrays and for loops. Very cool right?Think again!At one point the book instructs you to test your movie as it should now be functional. I did so only to find out that it was not. I headed over to the friends of ed website, and did a search in the their forums. Apparently this is a problem everyone is having. The author responded by saying that he knew it was a problem but would only fix it AFTER he finished his next book!Unreal. Do not buy this [junk]."
1,Mixing Flash and LSD,"Reading this book was like trying to learn trig on acid; it jumps around all over the place without ever trying to establish any clear points. It will start discussing one topic and without any conclusion or in depth explanation go on to the next topic. I found that very frustrating. It seems as if the writer(s) cannot write a clear and logical set of instructions. Do not buy this book unless you are an expert in Actionscript, and in that case you won't probably need it anyhow."
3,Disappointment from the ED group,"I bought this book with the intention of learning more in depth use of actionscript with all of its wonders...Instead, I was bombarded with too much game design stuff. The table of contents was misleading and the focus of the book was useless for true web design.There are many books out there for actionscript, I suggest any of the others."
1,This book is a rip off.,"There is no substancial information about trading other than symbols for a large number of companies, this takes 1/3 of the book the other 2/3 talk about how carefull you should be but doesn't give you specifics. The information about the industry is very inaccurate. If you have access to the internet there is nothing in this book you can't get on one of the many internet portal out there and you get accurate information. If you are new to trading this book doesn't help and if you are allready trading you'll find it very useless."
4,why'd they skip uu 95'?,i just want to know why they skipped the ultimate ultimate 95' in this line of releases.
3,"Coffee, Tea or Me","I first read Coffee, Tea or Me in the late 1960's and, like a few million other teenage American girls, it made me want to run off and become a stewardess. (Unfortunately, at 4'10"" and 95 lbs, I was a bit shrimpy to be a sky-girl, but I did wind up working for a major airline in a big American city, just not as a stew. This book was the reason I applied for a job at the airline.) The author is a man, writing in first-person as two American stewardesses in their 20's, so he makes a few tactical errors, but the book is still a lot of fun. (And you have to forgive the author for his recounting of events in those pre-sexual harrassment suit days. Don't shoot the messenger!) I could swear the original ending was different from the re-published version I just read. The result is the same, though: a rollicking good time!"
2,Is this really fiction?,"For the past 45 plus years I thought this was a non fiction book! I was surprised to find out that it was written by a man! He said that he did interview the two stewardesses but that their funny stories did not fill up a book, so the had to make up most of it. I flew for United Airlines for 31 years and never saw this much sex action, but like I said, it is fiction. I remember when this book was published and how racy it was very for that era.Linda Akinsauthor, From Stewardess to Flight Attendant, Infinity Publishing."
3,A blast from the past,"For anyone who had anything to do with the airline industry during the 50s and 60s, this is a fun book -- a slightly randy look at stewardess life in the heyday of flying. Cute book, fun reading.Coffee, Tea or Me? The Uninhibited Memoirs of Two Airline Stewardesses"
2,not what you expect,"No juice stories, probably written by people that got married and didn't want to be honest about the life they were used to.Don't spend money buying this book....."
1,Nowhere Near True,"Having been a real airline Stewardess for a real airline in the 1960's I knew this book is total fiction. I had never read it until the recent reprint. There is no way that it is true. No airline would put up with a lot of stuff in that book. The stewardesses could not have met all of those celebrities and men from different countries. I could go on and on but suffice it to say that it is quite obvious that the book is totally made up by Donald Bain who is a ghost writer. However for this book he is a fiction writer. It is funny and entertaining, and totally ridiculous. It doesn't reflect at all the real world of airline stewardesses in the 1960's. If you realize it is fiction you might enjoy it."
4,Fun and Cute Book,"This book takes place in a time I've never experienced and... looks like I never will. A time when flying was glamorous and sexy???The protagonists are two young, beautiful and fun stewardesses. Trudy and Rachel are on their own for the first time and are living it up. Flying and traveling provides many opportunities for meeting men and mayhem. Both of which they do in plenty. But they still manage to make it to their flights for work the next day. A fun, if not highly exaggerated account, of a stewardess's life in the 60s.I thought this book was a memoir because... well... the title is, The Uninhibited Memoirs of Two Airline Stewardesses. So, I was a little disappointed to find out that it isn't truly a memoir. It's only based on the stories of two stewardesses and was embellished on quite a bit from there. Despite that small disappointment, it is a charming and entertaining read all the same."
4,Pretty good book,"We used this book to help train our Dalmation puppy last year. The illustrations were helpful as were the easy to follow steps for housebreaking and obedience training. Some of the information was obvious, but it was good to be reminded."
4,A great computer experience from hp,"Last month I desperatly needed to replace my old hp from 1995. This brand new hp is fantastic. It's fast enough, has all the necessary programs you need, and offers a nice gaming experience. For sound, the Polk Audio speakers work very well.The computer has a nice, sleek, metallic blue and silver look. It has easy to access USB and Serial ports in the front, along with a 48x CD Drive and a nice CD storage area at the the top. I didn't buy an hp monitor mainly because it's horrendously ugly (my reason for giving it 4 stars). I picked up a satisfying ViewSonic monitor with a nice silver color.Windows XP is fantastic. The new start menu is very nice, and the program offers so much more than previous Windows installments. Plus, the program has a very modern look to compete with the current efforts of Apple's fancy new systems.All in all, if you just need a fast computer for the needs of any computer junkie, I'd strongly reccomend this hp."
1,Boring and pretentious,"I've enjoyed other Jarman films: Edward II, Caravaggio, even Sebastian. But this one just doesn't connect. Blurry pictures of people shooting up drugs, pretending to have sex with posters of Caravaggio paintings, staging what appears to be a wedding. There's no dialog, just screeching music and voice-over readings that don't have much to do with the visuals. The point seems to be that the world (or Thatcher's England, anyhow) is an awful place. Well, you can watch the TV news and get the same message with less eyestrain."
2,came with a dead battery,"I bought it as a gift for my mother-in-law about a year ago, who came to visit me recently. She brought the watch with her and told me it never worked, not for a single day. I went to spend $$ to change the battery and now it is running at least. Let's hope it is only the battery issue."
4,"A great book , and cheap as well!","I learned my calculus many years ago and found it hard. By using this book I have not only revived what I knew, and more, but have found it much easier than I expected! The text manages to combine brevity with great clarity, and the exercises are (usually) well graded.The book is an excellent refresher but beginners would probably find it too terse.Be warned that Klaf supplies answers to only the odd-numbered questions in the exercises. If you're working without a teacher, this is a pain, and if it weren't for this (IMHO) defect I'd give the book 5 stars without any doubt.Be warned also that the book was written over 50 years ago and that consequently the applied calculus examples (which are relatively few) are given using imperial units."
4,Excellent book to review but lacks...,"This book is great for review of calculus. The method of solving arbitrary problems is really helpful because of the generalities that they encompass. I like using this book as my reference and integral book because it has a great appendix. I've added my own little tidbits here and there too.The only thing that makes this lack 5 stars is the fact that there is a little too much attention given to engineering. If things were phrased from a physics standpoint then carry-over to engineering would be implicit.Also, it is not really organized by what you encounter chronologically in the study of calculus. The contents page is more like a one-liner to get you where you need to be then you do the digging.All in all....worth it."
1,The worst computer I ever have,"I had enormous problems with my HP zt1180 notebook. from its build-in microphone to 512K RAM, hard drive etc. I wish I had never wasted my money."
3,"good value for price, good for 3 years.","I am re-reviewing this to give updated views on HP laptop. Considering expected 2-3 years of life (exacerbated by my extensive usage), overall I am happy with my system with moderate rating.Here are the pros and cons of this system:+ Good price for the functionality and configuration I got in the given price.+ Very nice resolution.- Its getting rebooted without any known reasons. It happened 8-10 times in last 2 years and must have been hardward problem asit happens with Windows and Linux on this laptop. My friend bought HP laptop in 2003 (2 years after I bought) and that problem is still there in HP which is NOT good.- Battery life quite poor and now it runs out in just 10-20 minutes. I believe battery needs to be cultivated which I didn'tin the begining.Given the duration and to the extend I used this system, i don't have much complain on this. But I will certainly consider other manufacturer for my next laptop."
3,"Good for the absolute beginner, but for the experienced administrator may not be the greatest option","First and foremost this book is highly accessible, easy to read, and it's information is relevant, on-point and accurate for its time. Although written during a time where Web Server administration's pedagogy was in its infancy the book does an all around good job in instructing how HTTP works, the types of web servers and how to set up IIS, Apache and other various services such as DNS to get a webserver up and running on the internet along instructions and the science behind various extensions and modules, but lacks contents that digresses deeper into common tasks you may have to do as an administrator.It's a good book for beginners but to someone who is more experienced with web server administration may look for a book that covers more administrative tasks that you may want to do.Good for the beginner, but the more experienced administrators may look elsewhere."
2,relic,"This book is way too old to be of much use, but it was a good buy since I needed it for class. It also covers Microsoft IIS, so if you're like most Web server admins and want to run GNU/Linux, half of the book will probably be a waste of your time. The other half will teach you some technologies that are several years old, but maybe we can use those as a basis for today's applications. It's also Red Hat specific which can differ from Debian in terms of where the config files are located, what they're called, and what the package manager's commands are."
4,Pretty good,"This is a pretty good book for those looking for an introduction to the installation and maintenance of web servers.It explains the basics and goes on to show you how to install and manage an Apache installation.I don't use it anymore, but it's not bad."
5,"I RELATE TO UNCLE WIGGILY , EVEN AS AN ADULT","The most proper Mr. Rabbitt, and his Nephew were able to successfully survive on LemonAide and IceCream, when their hot air balloon would accidently land on deserted islands. A series of stories relating to making the best of things in life.. I grew up with his stories and ended up living in Hawaii for the past 27 years! Andsucessfully too"
4,A spiritual journey,The latest information on the Shroud and questions about its authenticity as the burial cloth of Jesus by an author who is convinced it is. Full of solid research and a good discussion of the controversy surrounding the carbon testing. It's a quick read with lots of good information.
1,Danger - Danger Will Robinson...Do Not Buy This Book,"I repeat, do not buy or read this book. Although I believe the shroud is real, this author writes in a confused manor. He adds nothing of his own to the story and constantly repeats others research over and over and over and over and over. Each chapter is a re-hash of the last. Each thought process is a mind numbing repeat of the same thought mentioned not 6 pages ago. When he does stumble on a good idea, he drops it like a hot fire poker and jumps back to his insane repeating of the same dogma over and over and over.Buy someone else's book and read it. Make up a story yourself and tell it to yourself. Go see the movie A Boy and his Dog. Vote Democratic, do anything, do nothing, but don't buy this book."
5,Mantras and their purpose,"Swami Radha has made a profound contribution to Yoga and related lore in her writings; this is an outstanding example. Written with candor and intense spiritual insight, she adds an important volume to the literature of Mantra Yoga. Moreover, her personal experience and eminent qualification to address this topic adds power and depth to her treatise. This is a book to read slowly, reflectively, savoring her elegant yet remarkably simple manner of revealing one of India's great secrets. A valuable addition to the library of any serious student of Yoga or Eastern traditions."
5,Incredible Story,"I have always wanted to learn more about St. Augustine, however his Confessions was quite intimidating. This book is a very easy read and tell the story from St. Monica's birth until her death. I only wish that it had ended at St. Augustine death instead. I highly recommend this book."
4,"Mathematica by Example, Fourth Edition by Martha L. Abell, James P. Braselton",This is a no nonsense text which enables the user to quickly extract thier results from Mathematica
1,Software Manual,"Normally, when you buy a software, the package comes with a manual. This so-called book is the manual without the software, you have to buy the software separately at a beginning price of about $140. Without the software, this software manual is useless. Furthermore, this manual does not teach you mathematics, it assumes that you are in full command of the subject. If you are involved in a topic that requires evaluations of mathematical expressions, then this manual together with the software will teach how to perform the necessary nitty-gritty work quickly and effortlessly. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK THINKING THAT IT IS A STAND-ALONE BOOK!"
5,Outstanding except for being out of date,"I met Boston T. Party, AKA Kenneth W. Royce several years ago during a week long educational and training event he gave in Wyoming at which time he was sponsoring Wyoming as a free state. I have bought several of his books including this one. I have incorporated some of his suggestions in ""How to Make ID Cards & Create a New Identity!"" [...]Boston T. Party is the type of person our country needs. He believes in freedom and his books are outstanding. With all the new laws, procedures, and technology used in identification documents, Bulletproof Privacy needs to be updated. Even so, it is perhaps the best book on identity and privacy. I highly recommend it because, dated or not, many of the ideas and suggestions in the book are still applicable"
1,Do not buy this book.,"I can see why Mr. Party writes under a pen name. I would be embarrassed to pen a book like this. It is not helpful because it is too full of half-truths and convoluted thought. It is full of ranting generalizations and few specifics. In most instances (I would say in the most important instances) he professes ignorance or lack of space or time to address the issue and merely refers you to another book. Perhaps that is the books most redeeming quality.Seriously, do not waste your money on this ranting half-wit of a book."
1,bulletproof privacy,Not worth the price I paid used. Unless you are wanted by the police or government for some reason this book is usless. People running from the law would probably get something out of this book. That is whom it is written for.
3,Good privacy ideas but out of date,The author needs to revise this work for today's world.He has some good ideas and has written some fine recommendations on the use of trusts and privacy living.I'd like to see an updated version of Bulletproof Privacy.
2,hate to disagree but...,"While this book is probably of better quality than most, I did not find it all that great. If you are looking for information about getting a private mailbox, don't look here. While the advice is decent, it was not what I was looking for.Even worse, the author in several places hints that he has even better methods but won't reveal them to us(in order to protect his own privacy).A good book? Yes. But for me(trying to find information on using the postal mail system privatly), it did not have what I wanted.I still enjoyed reading it(just because I like this sorta thing) but it really didn't have much one couldn't figure out for oneself with a bit of thinking."
5,Kids love tattoos,"We included tattoos books with our Xmas, b-day, and other gift packages for kids. Colorful and detailed, they are a hit every time."
2,Did not last,I got these for my 4 year old son. The images would not transfer completely onto his skin and the tattoo would easily slide off his skin after an hour. My son was disappointed. I did buy at a local store not on Amazon. Would not buy again.
5,Peter Mayer's musical talent shines on Romeo's Garage!,"Peter Mayer and his band have outdone themselves again in this newest release! Romeo's Garage is a great collection of new songs from a very talented group of musicians. Peter's gift for songwriting rocks on A Little Too Happy, his blues shine on BB's Got The Blues, and only Peter could write a top ten contender about coffee - Morning Star Cafe. Romeo's Garage is a must-have addition to anyone's collection!"
3,For Romantics Only,"This sonnet sequence could be rather boring to the untrained eye. As an English major, I was able to appreciate Browning's strict following of the rules for sonnets (which are extremely hard to write well and forced me to give this book an extra star) and her diction. The history of the sonnet sequence is more interesting than the sonnets themselves. Yet there are quite a few poems that make you feel all gushy inside and make you want to go fall in love!"
5,Great Desktop PC,I have owned the HP Pavilion 750n for over 2 years now and I am very happy with it. It is very reliable and fast and I've had no problems with it. It comes ready for todays tasks and for tasks to come. The PC is very simple to connect together. I'd certainly recommend this PC to others and would not hesitate to purchase HP again in the future.
1,worthless!,"I bought this computer thinking I was getting a fast, reliable substitute for my 6yr old computer. The first day I bought it, the thing started randomly restarting itself when I hadn't even installed any new hardware or software yet, so I had to run the recovery program and re-install everything. After this it worked fine for about 3 hours, then I installed my printer and it started working very, very slowly even for simple tasks like opening a window and eventually started randomly restarting again about every ten minutes or so. I was better off with my crappy old computer with win95! at least I could carry out functions without worrying about the thing restarting every time the mouse moves."
4,New user in midwest,I don't need to say many words. I bought the 750n and I'm very satisfied with its performance. My family has tried various applications and software and have had no problems. We think it's a great machine.
2,"It is ok for some things, but many facts are wrong.","Its a great book if the only thing you want to look at is pictures. It's so filled with errors in the stats of items and creatures that no one should use it as a guide. This book she be bought for fun and not bought if you need help with Diablo. The strategies and tips are practically useless. It seems that the makers of ""Diablo: The Official Strategy Guide"" have put very little effort into the book because of the many spelling errors and fact errors."
3,"The tips are obvious, but I like reading stats","I knew when I bought the book I would not need the tips inside, the reason why I bought it was to find stats for the uniques, monsters, weapons, and spells. I got All of those (although there were a lot of mistakes in the monster section). If you want stats, this is a good book, although I DO wish it had monster stats for nightmere and hell difficulty levels. I have a neat tip that is NOT in the book for you. If you want to play nightmere or hell in single-player mode, just load up a multi-player game, start on the difficulty you like, then start a new single-player game. It only works for version 1.7 though, and I am a Mac owner so I'm not sure if it works for PC."
5,It contains all the info for Diablo a player needs,"After reading the book, I found it very useful especially with the whole list of monsters, weapons, shrines, spells, hero attributes and more. This is a book worth buying"
3,Helpful to people who haven't played the game as much.,"The book I bought on a whim when I was looking for a new cd. It has a lot of information, most of which I had figured out in the years I had been playing Diablo. Some things were new. I think for those who haven't played the game as much as I have it can be a big help. For people like me it still helps keep the information organized."
3,Great Action...Great Story...not a Classic..,"In the world of Pirate movies this one falls a little short. The action scenes are well choreographed and the story is allright. This film just can't seem to catch momentum, and at times drags on. The female lead is annoyoing, but cute. If adventure is your thing than give this movie a shot....If your looking for something more classic check out ""the sea hawk"", or ""the Adventures of Robin Hood"""
2,pirates of tortuga' not quite torturous,"pirates of tortuga is a moderately entertaing film, altho with pedestrian effects and stiff acting. would have been much improved if they had dropped the dancing girls scene, which slows down the pacing. this they put on dvd but ignore really good films like seven seas to calais and tnt's version of treasure island"
2,Captain Bloodless,"Pirates of Tortuga is chiefly of interest today as an example of how, even in the early sixties, the studio infrastructure could lend even cheap programmers lavish production values. True, most of the sea battles are stock footage from The Black Swan, but the standing backlot sets at Fox give this Sam Katzman quickie a fairly lavish look. Shame it never finds much interesting use to put them to, with the third-rate cast failing to provide any color to offset the clichés, although it does offer a rare opportunity to hear the oft-dubbed John Richardson, the Clive Owen of his day, use his own voice in a supporting role. Once the bookies favorite to take over the role from Sean Connery, just be grateful that George Lazenby got to play James Bond instead!Fox's DVD offers a good enough 2.35:1 widescreen transfer and includes the original theatrical trailer."
5,THIS IS THE ONE!,"Not only is this DVD the best bargain out there( five routines on 2 dvds) but it is the best yoga dvd I have ever owned or seen.The camera work is beautiful. The setting is serene. The commentary is perfect. Not too much talking. Just enough. Not too much whip-cracking, just the right amount of emphasis on knowing when to push and when to back off. I found it very inspirational.I loved the music too. Not too airy fairy. It was atmospheric ,soothing and energizing at times.There are some humorous parts of the dvd too. Overall I have done 4 of the 5 rotuines and they all left me feeling great.I also liked that I could pick a level of each pose that worked well for me so I can grow with this one as my yoga improves.One last thing, there is something magical about this dvd. The people in it somehow feel like your friends by the end of the routine. It feels warm and fun.I can't recommend this one enough."
2,Not as great of a bargain as it seems,"Eoin is a very soothing yogi, and the practice is well rounded with many levels of each pose for different abilities... BUT! you had better REALLY LIKE the full 80 minute practice, because all the ""other"" practices on this DVD are just differently edited versions of that same full practice. You aren't really getting 5 ""different"" practices, in my opinion, and anyone with a programmable DVD player can do what they've done here. Very disappointed in the misleading advertising."
5,Can't Say Enough Good Things,"This DVD Makes me... well, HAPPY.Really, the routines are so nice. They flow really well. Eoin's voice is calming and doesn't make me feel like I need to overdo it.I love the ""Magically Hips"" Routine in particular. It really makes me feel open and alive. As Eion says in the commentary, ""when your hips loosen up, it makes you feel younger and more vital""I think this DVD is great for losing weight too. It is challenging, but the pace is not so fast that I couln't keep up.The people really look like they are having fun (I thought you had to be more serious when you did Yoga)and there is just such a feeling of positivity that runs through it.It is a unique product and I can not say that I own a Yoga or Fitness DVD that I have enjoyed more. It is my new favorite!"
1,Disappointment,This is the type of yoga that gives yoga a bad name. I will not even give this one to a student or friend; put it in the Goodwill bag.
4,"Good workouts - he's a bit flakey, funny!","I like the workouts and feel good doing this workout - however Finn is a bit of a hippy, flaky, peace, love, and all that instructor. I wish he would talk less about loving and more about form and what muscles you are working - More fitness less philosophy. Once you get past his quirky personality it is a great workout and I do the tape frequently, not sure that i will buy more though."
3,Not sure if this is even fair to say...,"Well, I guess I like this DVD.It helps losen my hips and stretched, and everything I would look for in a Yoga class. I also don't mind how fast they go because that helps bringing my heart rate up. But I'm so not into whatever he says. It makes me laugh and stares at the TV, ""what the...""I guess that's his style. If you know what I'm talking about and still likes him, then this is a great yoga exercise DVD."
5,Itinerant Kiwi,"I own quite a few yoga DVDs now, and this is my favourite. Partly because of the relaxed happy style in which it was produced, and partly because of the range of practices available. As one reviewer said, the vinyasas between poses are a bit fast for my liking, but you can always pause the DVD. The tragically/magically hips section is excellent; you will feel great afterwards. A range of people showing modifications helps. Nice garden scenery as a relaxing backdrop.If like me, you don't like too much navel gazing interfering with your yoga, this is just the right touch."
4,"Well written, vivid and accurate account of a great scientis",I found this a very readable and important summary of Meitner's career.It is a very human story and helps explain the great injustices which deprived her of a well deserved Nobel Prize. It's manages full scientific details without becoming obscure.
4,Deprived of a Nobel Prize,"It is well known that in the fields of both science and math, women are less visible than men. Ruth Lewin Sime, a woman of science herself, wrote this excellent book about a tiny Jewish woman who escaped the Nazis after World War II and was deprived of the Nobel Prize she clearly deserved. Meitner never married but physics gave meaning to her life, she was responsible for nuclear fission. This is a book that should be part of the reading lists in women's studies and in all high schools. It can serve as a magnet in attracting females to study science. Lise Meitner broke the patterns of women denied equitable access to education. This book is not only well written but it is also rich in fotos with an appendix full of interesting scientific data. You don't have to be in the field of science to understand this historical biography of an incredible woman."
1,Worked only 1 day!!,"My son got to play with this for one day, then it would not work anymore. It was a lot of fun for the few hours that it worked. We will be sending it back. Very dissapointed!!"
2,Nice realistic replica. Build quality is very bad.,My kids loved this bike. The details are realistic. However the build quality is very bad. This is my second one purchased. The front section broke off after a couple of runs.
1,"Usless piece of ""Chineese"" plastic","Not worth it - don't spend your money.Breaks in 2 days of playing with it, spend your money on something better."
3,Fall Over Easily,"The product is well made and lots of fun, but it doesn't have a wide base so it topples over easily when it hits a bump. It can't go over anything. It's best on a super flat service. We recommend something with a wider base for more enjoyable play. My 5 year old gets frustrated with it falling over all the time."
5,Best Buy - Too much fun!,"My two-year old twin boys each received one of these for Christmas from the in-laws, and my first thought was, ""Not another r/c toy."" Boy, was I wrong. These are a blast - very sturdy, easy to use for my 4-yr old, and even the boys can use the remote, although they can't quite control the direction of the Ducati yet.They love to have me ""chase"" them around the kitchen with these. Unlike other r/c cars, I can steer right, left, forward, and backwards. The only problem is that it doesn't work on carpets - you need to use them on a hard floor.The other problem is that both motorcyles use the same frequency, so I use one remote for both. Difficult to actually ""race"" the motorcyles, but fun to race the motorcyle with one of their other r/c cars. Other than that, the boys (and my daughter) want to play with these every day."
1,Controls are terrible and NO crossover,"I agree about menu. It has to be the worst I have ever seen. Nothing is intuitive. I have to have the owners manual with me to make just the simplest changes. Nothing like the Sony's and Pioneers I have used. Totally sucks. So much so that I am just going to through mine away. I don't want anyone else to have to go through what I have to. Another thing, why can't Alpine put a crossover into a $200 CD player. I have an older Sony that cost me $150 that has it. I was lied to by the owner of a small shop in Bridgeport WV that it did have one. I should have researched it better so that is my fault but he still should have let me know as that was one THE most important criteria in a head unit for me."
3,light of the dark ages,"This book was of more historical interest than mathematical significance. I found its discussion of the problem about duplicating the cube to be an interesting treatment of proportional means, but the substance of this book is an academic interpretation of Pappus' historical context. It's too bad that no one has prepared a good english edition of Pappus' Collections (or Synagogue); I found a French edition when I had library privileges as a graduate student long ago, and it's really important. Pappus was true to his criticisms about how many mathematicians make things difficult in an effort to show off; his theorems really get to his points to simplify by reducing the number of terms rather than complicating forms toward simplistic conclusions."
5,Chewy Runts,I order this for my fiance' for sweetest day. It's his favorite candy and it is so hard to find in stores. He was so suprised and happy I did this for him!
1,Wrong Picture!,"Reason for the poor rating is that the picture displayed is a RED Java and what was shipped was a Green Java. It appears Amazon doesn't know the difference, because I ordered from 2 different vendors and I keep getting GREEN when what is pictured is RED!"
4,trendy sterling silver pendant,"very pretty, really like it. Glad I bought it. Have had lots of comments on it."
4,Great storage solution,"I bought the 1 gigabyte TeraStation through Amazon. Setup was very rapid and straightforward. The unit I received had an annoying vibration. which according the Buffalo, was caused by a bad drive. They offered to send a new drive, but the effort to replace a drive was significant. The unit has to be almost completely disassembled, unlike many other kinds of disk arrays. I finally sent the whole system back and received a replacement promptly from Buffalo. I shudder at the thought of replacing a bad drive in the future, but the cost-effectiveness of the TerStation still makes it a good choice."
4,Works like a charm,"We have been running our storeage device for over a year. We had one problem (no service) after a thunder storm; noticed the red light was on on the box, reset and it worked fine.We are about to buy a second headless server and it will be a Buffalo.In an ideal situation, DELL or one of the other retailers would offer onsite maintenance contracts like they do for their computers but these servers are so inexpensive you can just buy a second one."
1,Dreadful!,"This is a deeply prejudiced, homophobic book which is written without a background grasp of the intellectual and academic world to which it refers. It repeatedly makes unsubstantiated assertions, its critical apparatus is unprofessional and its use if language often misleading. One example of his bias is that the author maintains that Eddie Marsh was more influential in the world outside the Apostles than Maynard Keynes in unspecified fields but including, by implication, the arts. No mention is made of the fact that Keynes established two major arts organisations that still exist, namely, a theatre in Cambridge and the Arts Council of Great Britain. Likewise his assertion that the cultivation of religious and philosophical doubts by members of the Apostles led to ""the loss of the will to govern"" in Britain!"
4,A thrilling movie,We got the only copy in the local BB on VHS only and really enjoyed. My wife enjoys getting involved in a movie and was yelling at the screen at some of more tense points.Very Canadian...but in a good way not bad...production value was good.A real gem that has not been widely available in video stores. Made my top 10 for 2002
3,DEFINITELY NOT THE AVERAGE GANG EXPLOITATION MOVIE,"A WEALTHY WHITE MAN WALKS ONTO A GANG'S TURF. WHEN HE PREVENTS ONE OF THE GANG MEMBERS FROM ROBBING HIM, THE WHOLE GANG TRYS TO GET VENGEANCE ON HIM. TRAPPED IN THE WOODS, HE MUST FIGHT TO ESCAPE THE GANG. THE REAL SUPRISING THING IS THAT MUCH OF THE GANG IS ACTUALLY WHITE. THERE'S ONLY TWO BLACK MEMBERS. ANYWAY, THIS MOVIE IS ACTUALLY PRETTY GOOD DESPITE THE FACT THAT IT MOVES AT A CONSIDERABLY SLOW PACE. THOUGH THE COVER FOR THIS MOVIE LOOKS LIKE A GANGSTA MOVIE, IT'S FAR FROM BEING ONE. IF YOU'RE JUST LOOKING FOR A GANGSTA MOVIE THAT HAS A LOT OF SHOOTING AND KILLING, THIS IS DEFINITELY NOT A MOVIE YOU WANNA RENT. HOWEVER, IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A MOVIE THAT HAS A SIMPLISTIC PLOT, THEN I'D SUGGEST YOU GET TO YOUR LOCAL VIDEOSTORE AND RENT THIS."
5,Strong debut from a talented singer-songwriter,"Clyde Robert's ""Read 'Em and Weep"" showcases his considerable talent for combining strong melodies with thoughtful, introspective lyrics. Different stylistic influences are evident, from the hard-rockin' ""Steep Price"" and ""All I Wanted""; the rockabilly-like, ""Hard Heart Aches""; to the gentle, acoustic tunes ""I Wish That I Was James"" and ""Mr. Harold in Room 12"". Eric Weissberg (of Bob Dylan, etc. fame) and Lenny Pickett (ex-Tower of Power and current Saturday Night Live) lend their stellar talents to this album. All in all, a fine first effort from a talented songwriter."
1,Grrrrr...:(,"I should have known better than to buy this book.. What IS it with this writer and sexual assualt?! In every book I've read by him, some guy attempts to rape the main character! I realize that it's important to talk about these things, but jeez, in every book?! That really irritated me, so I haven't read anymore books by him. The main girl is always sickeningly sweet, and the plot is usually flat or just plain improbable."
3,Cara is being stalked . Who is doing it ? Read to find out.,"This book was very interesting. It kept me in suspense about what was going to happen next. For example Cara was being chased, as she climbed a gate to get away from her attacker. Silence overfell the scene. What happened to him? Where did he go? Read the book to find out."
2,stylus end was not a match!!!!,i have a cingular 8125htc wizard and figured this was a reasonable price for a stylus...well the the end of the stylus sticks out of my phone...it is not a perfect match!!!! =(
2,stylus,it was a disappointing purchase. Because the image shows that the stylus looks exactly like the original one that came with the phone. Well it's NOT. It's shorter version and the tip (with which we write) in this stylus is a black cup that came off after a month of use. It's a cheap kind of stylus and a waste of money!
1,Wrong item,Wrong item shiped. I have t-mobile MDA. The picture shows one thing and when the item was ship to me was not the same thing. I have been calling no respond.
3,htc mda stylus pen,"perfect for htc mda (T-mobile pocket pc),catches every corner of the screen, awseome retraction,,,,,,,,,,lost it in a week poorly desighned to be held in the phone."
5,Great Pen,I have just bought this stylus and I like it much. The writng is so smooth and very reliable.The way it function is raely intresting and very easy.The metal touch gives it a realy professional look and style.
3,"Cute, but not laundry strong","It is a lovely sleeper, very very cute. But after the first wash, the fabric started to show signs of tear and wear."
1,A dated relic of old school thinking,"Aside from the massive changes in the last 4 years, this book is otherwise dated in that it simply re-hashes info from other (older) sources.Maybe they will publish a new edition that may be worthwhile..."
1,30 decidely average stills from the movie,30 decidedly average stills from the decidedly below average movie. for a few quid more you can get the making of alien resurrection book that contains many far superior pictures and a heck of a lot of interesting reading. it's a blatant cash-in that i'd recommend people avoid...
4,a good read!,"i just returned from a trip to the white mountains where I came across this book. i was very much interested in the history of the presidential mountain range and this book gave me quite a bit of insight as to the history of the mountain range and mount washington. this book is a wonderful read - i enjoyed it immensely. the book covers the tragedies that have befallen the mountain range and in such detail, i could visualize being there. hats off to nicholas howe! thanks for the insight!"
5,Not without Peril,"Great book, full of history and mountaineering stories on one of the world's most dangerous mountain!"
5,Staying true to his art,"Once again Master P and his Army have stayed true to the game. He hasn't crossed over or changed his style for anyone. An uncompromising look at life, death, happiness, and sadness."
1,this is the worst cd i have ever heard good thing i didn't u,don't waist ur money on this master p madjor mess u
3,Where can I get this cd at?,I listened to the samples and it sounds aight. I just never heard of this cd.
3,Reruns...I hate reruns,"Bsaically this book is a composition of her live shows, which if you have seen, are way funnier live than in print. If you haven't seen her live, or heard one of her CD's then you might be interested, but much of ""Leaville"" is lost in the translation from live to print. Without the screaming and the faces and the body language it just isn't as funny."
5,Wickedly clever trip back in time,"This album is for those pining for the golden age of the spy genre when class acts like John Steed and Cathy Gale would beat second handers like Austin Powers to the finish every time! Clever retro jazz, surf and other period music are done with style, wit, grace and deadpan seriousness ranging from mellow covers of ""... San Jose"" to the Feztastically over-the-top ""Satan's Shriners."""
3,pricey parable,"The plot is worthy of a medieval passion play: the good folk are so good and the bad folk are so so so bad. The Church of England looks very bad here, and justly so, its superficial liberalities failing to mask a deeply evil intent to privilege men - straight men - above all other people. There are many interesting characters, but we don't get to spend much time with them, as the shadow of Coincidence (no more plausible for being cloaked as God's Will) falls over the narrative and things conclude very quickly, leaving many subplots hanging for, one can only suppose, a sequel.$15 is a lot for an afternoon's read."
5,Keep your car cool,"these things work great. if it is raining and you want to crack your windows, no rain comes in. when you have park your car in the sun on a hot summer day you will notice it is faster to cool down if you leave your windows down an inch or two."
5,Magical Short Stories,This book is full of magical tales told by an ethnographer who is very familiar with the Maya. He is the translator of the Popol Vuh and also the Rabinal Achi. He knows what he's talking about and can write beautifully. This book is a must read for those who travel in Mexico and Guatemala.
3,critique,"ms criscenzo should stick to telling of her travels in mexico and the maya civilation. i'll bet her 12 year old daughter made up the romantic encounters. besides that; the book is greatly overpriced. too bad, i seem to be the first to review it."
5,I had this a long time ago and I'm buying it again because I lost it.,"I saw Caleb Engstrom at the Irving a couple years back and bought their cd. It was stolen since, but I am buying it again. It's such feel good music. His voice and the way the instruments mesh so well together. I'm big on the xylophone, so it's good for that. Somewhat of a climactic album but without volume increases and not too much tempo change. It has a good vibe to chill on the back porch with friends or just something to make you smile when you listen to it by yourself."
5,Really amazing production,"A wonderful production of Patience. Very funny, great costumes, fabulous singing and arch acting - what more can one ask for from Gilbert and Sullivan?There are some nice live mistakes and recoveries going on that add to the enjoyment value."
5,WONDERFUL IS THE WORD,"A MAGIC PERFORMANCE TO BE ENJOYED FROM THE FIRST TO THE LAST MOMENT. WONDERFUL IS THE WORD!Ernesto Oppicelli - Genova, Italy"
5,Great Romance,"After seven long years, Justin had finally stopped running. Though years had passed since he'd left town, Justin Kincaid still had something to prove. Especially to Megan Bartlett, the only woman he'd ever loved and the one woman he could never forgive. This couldn't be happening, Megan told herelf, Justin was back, Justin Kincaid had returned. But the boy he'd been was gone, replaced by a man who'd brought Megan a child to cherish. And to confront.Comment: Life in a small town. Megan lived in terror of her reputation being compromised and Justin held it against her. A lot of conflict there. Both characters emotions and viewpoints were presented. Story also had an additional plot with a very exciting end. I figured who the villain was soon enough, but the discovery and apprehension were still intense. Very satisfying read."
5,Nice perfume but beware,"this perfume was recommended to me by one of the top noses in the country. It's one of my favorites. Floral but not fussy, it has a richness that satisfies my usually ""oriental"" preferences. Beware when buying this perfume that you get the ""eau de parfum"", (which is the strongest concentration Lalique produced) and not the eau de toilette or a lesser concentration."
4,Another Clasic show,UFC was a good show and one to add to your collection. both Marco Ruas and Paul Varelans show a lot of what they could do and were impressive....The Super fight between Ken Shamrock vs. Oleg Taktarov was like the Shamrock/Gracie fight long and slow..with the ref pulling them apart about 3 or 4 times during the 33 minutes to restart and conitnue. those long 30 minute matches with both of them locked in holds and not doing much...Was not something I enjoyed..Any Fan of UFC should add this one to their collection if for any reason then Nostalgia.
5,Wonderful movie hits the heart and the music is exellant also,"I have loved Tina Turner for every, and have even seen this movie how many times, and I still had to buy it cause of the music, and the motivation this one woman has and had to keep her family going and her children as safe as she could. The movie does make the tears flow, but it shows so much love and the craving for life, and what someone can do no matter how hard it is out there in the world, or even how raw your own blood can treat you. It makes me have faith and strength. I thank her for putting this movie out for all of us to see. Some people laughed at me for renting it when I did, but after they watched it with me, they never laughed again, They loved it. So I do recommend buying this movie. I really really do.Thank you"
4,"entertaining movie, but not Tina's real life story...","The movie is great and entertaining, Laurence and Angela did an excellent job!!! With that said, I read Tina's autobiography ""I, Tina"", and realized that this movie sugarcoats Tina's real life. In the movie, she is portrayed to be a vulnerable, naive woman who was swept off her feet, then taken advantage of by Ike. In real life, that wasn't the case. Yes, Ike was abusive and a terrible husband, but Tina wasn't as innocent, vulnerable, and naive as the movie makes her out to be.Watch the movie for entertainment and great performances, but if you want to take a peek into Tina's real life, read her book."
3,"Great music, not so great movie","Based on Tina Turner's autobiography ""I, Tina"" which she wrote in 1986.The movie is however quite different from the book and some scenes in the movie actually never happened. In interviews Tina often stated that she never saw Ike Turner after they were divorced. Him showing up with a gun at the Ritz concert in the movie is all made up !!! It's a shame that they didn't tell the story like it happened. If you want to see a more ""true"" life story of Tina Turner, buy ""The girl from Nutbush"" released in the early nineties on VHS and laserdisc.3 stars because of the great performances of Bassett and Fishburne and Tina's music.And please Disney, Widescreen, Dolby Digital and a trailer can hardly be called ""EXTRAS"" !!!!"
2,DVD : Film 'Whats Love Got To Do With It',"No problem with delivery, but when tried to play it, found it was not compatable with my DVD player here in the UK. Got it to work on a friends so not a total waste. I don't recall seeing any warnings that product may not be compatable. I think that when supplier is selling internationally then warnings should be given or sale should not be proceeded with."
1,unbelievable,"this movie was such a load of garbage, i can't believe so many people liked it. i happened to see the first 20 minutes or so on some cable channel and i thought it was just another washed-up no-name made-for-TV movie. weak and cliche acting, ridiculously paced, obviously striving for all kinds of things it can't achieve.....unbelievable that people call this ""award worthy"". a weak hollywood ""music"" movie trying to be emotional and stirring and just turning out cliche'd and predictable like all the others."
5,Gut Moving,"I never had Tina Turner's talent, but I lived her life & pain. This film brings back so much of my abuse from the hands of an older man. It has been over 35 yrs now & I still have dreams of him & his abuse. I was @ the show in the last scene in the movie 1985, she shined like a diamond."
4,IT'S VERY GOOD,Their story is so good and Angela Bassett played well in it. Tina Turners story was quite sad but it made me feel happy that she would forget about ti and be happy when shes on stage. A great film.
3,Angela Basset's arms are dyn-o-mite!,"What's Love Got To Do With It? is the biopic of singer Tina Turner. Angela Basset received an Oscar nomination for her fearless performance, she is a powerhouse! Laurence Fishburne is at his creepiest playing Ike Turner, Tina's manager and abusive husband. This film is a bit much at times but the performances cancel out the soapy plot. Check it out sometime!"
5,Angela did an incredible job of portraying TT-Oscar Material,"The movie was excellent as far as trying to cover Tina's life. Although the book goes into greater, more true to life information on Tina's life. But I guess you can't go that far in a Disney movie. Angela Basset was incredible as Tina and I think she got cheated out of that oscar!!! Lawrence Fishburn was way too handsome for Ike but he did a terrific job too."
4,It gives me hope,This is wounderful story that tell us woman that there is more in life than take for granted what we can do on our owen. I rated this cause I like it and I can watch it over and over again to remind me that we are strong woman and anything is possible.
5,Legend of Our Time,"I never really listened to Tina Turner except on the radio but one day I decided to watch What's Love Got To Do With It and I was absolutly blown away. The power and feeling Angela Bassett put into her character as Tina Turner was so convincing I actually started to believe it was the true superstar, not just an actress. Laurence Fishburne is an incrediable actor and he did a wonderful job portraying Ike Turner, to the point where I wanted to reach inside the television screen and hurt him as much as he was hurting Tina. He was so good being bad I can't believe he never won an Oscar for this incrediable role. I would recommend this movie to anyone who is a big Tina Turner fan or anyone who just want's to watch a very powerful and emotional film, full of extremly talented actors and actresses. May God always be with Tina Turner after the Hell on Earth she went through, thanks to Ike Turner."
4,no title,"Very good bio of Tina Turner, lots of music, energy, and stage sets. I like Laurence Fishburne a lot."
2,"Nice looking shoe, painful to wear..","These shoes are beautifully crafted, but poorly designed. I have an undemanding foot and have never had any issues with off-the-rack dress shoes not fitting correctly. Until I bought a couple pair of Kennetts. These shoes could be used as torture devises. It honestly feels like I'm wearing the shoes on the wrong foot. While they look fantastic (sitting in my closet), I do not recommend purchasing without trying on first. I'm disappointed because I really wanted to like these shoes (and not be out $300+). Oh well, live and learn."
1,Not worth it...,"I got this for my wife as a Christmas present. It's just an advertisement for this ladies other stuff.""Put your baby on the floor, buy my other stuff and videos."""
4,"mesmerizing, breathtaking and intriguing","2 great actors and just 1 muse,i.e., mysterious boy meets down-to-earth angel. as you can see, the topic goes further. so does this movie. if you're tired and weary of the everyday hollywood thing, you should try this one. auteil,dussolier and last but not least, beart are puppetted my the master hands of sautet to a story where love is described as something different, as something more than posession or care-taking.it's not just the usual love affair as we are accustomed. bittersweet and confusing, just like this love affair is."
2,"Nice music, boring film",The characters are entirely static and finally tedious. You want to send them home to get a screenplay and a plot.
5,"wonderful story, merging of music and emotion","This is a beautiful and moving film about life and its limits. In the background, there is this extraordinary music and talent, in the phenomenally beautiful Béart. But the one who controls the action is a passive man, the violin artisan, whose skill is matched by a kind of personal sterility that is attractive. It makes for an unusual balance. This is the kind of film that could never come out of the Hollywood mill, that explores mature pain and hope.Warmly recommended. The whole thing is like a poem with sound."
5,This film needs to be on DVD!,"I cannot for the life of me understand why this film isn't on DVD. This is absolutely one of my favorite films of all time, and judging by many of the other reviews, I'm not the only one that loves this beautifully executed film. The psychological profile of the characters and their effect on each other is very intriguing, and you can't help but be drawn in--all the while feeling like you're watching a train-wreck about to happen. The film does not judge the characters, but merely present them for you to draw your own conclusions. Often I find French films pretentious and irritating, but when I come across a gem like this one, I'm reminded of why I keep an eye out for French films."
3,Useful and a good starting point,"If you want to sell ""stuff"" this is a good place to start. All the information is here for opening a store. Follow the steps and your doors will be open. But maybe you don't want to sell ""stuff"" and have an idea you'd like to try out, if so I recommend ""Internet Riches"" by Scott Fox.It is also a great ""how-to"" book, but Internet Riches takes you past the nuts and bolts and presents strategies for great niche businesses that require little more than your own imagination and discipline to empower your life. It shows you how to set up an internet business for $25. You will see what has made America great, the ability to take an idea and turn it into a business. It is an all over great business guide.Despite the title it is full of down-to-earth examples and suggestions that are a far cry from the usual ""strike it rich"" schemes you find in books similarly titled.Internet Riches is a smart book for smart people, not dummies."
5,Starting an On-line Business? Start Here,So easy to follow and easy to make sense of these straightforward tips and strategies. The author stays familiar without being corny. I implemented many steps right away during the construction of my website with good results.
3,VHS Newton,"The VHS was fine. I had paid extra for next day delivery. It stated that it would be delivered on Friday. I did not receive the VHS until at least five days later. Which at that time I no longer needed it. I will save the VHS for future use, but was disappointed in the delivery."
3,it was ok...,"the story was fine, but not ""magical"" and the illustrations were cute. If your child was anticipating a baby brother or sister, it might resonate a little more with your family. My daughter did listen while I read this to her, but it wasn't one she asked me to read over and over. And although I wouldn't classify this as one of my ""must-haves"", it was a fine book, and certainly a lot more readable than others I have encountered."
2,Singer needs to be featured more,"Overall the record is palatable. However, this listener only gives ""Dust"" a two-star rating because the lead-singer's talent is frequently drowned out in the mix. I was deeply moved by the song ""Vortex""...and I hear 98 Degrees is contemplating a cover. Is the song ""Chrome"" about the lead singer's head? I love the symbolism. Where can I get a poster size album cover?"
1,Misleading,"If you are looking for music to bellydance to, this is not what you are looking for. It is heavily overlayed with club and techno beats. However, if you are looking for club style music with a little Middle Eastern flavor, you may like this one."
4,Great resource for professors,"This book was an excellent read. Covers almost all aspects of a professor's life. I would highly recommend this to any new professor or any professor who is truly interested in improving his/her teaching effectiveness. Wankat's really done his homework - sometimes the sheer number of references can get in the way, but they do shore up many of his arguments. Contains a lot of good quotes and statistics for use in both the classroom and faculty meetings."
2,Doesn't work for 4th generation,"It's a nice device, but with my 4th generation ipod nano, it doesn't charge the battery and the volume doesn't work."
2,"Nice product, but not for later generations",I agree with the other reviewer. Did not work for my later generation Ipod. The product was nice and seemed well put together but was wrong for my application.
2,This book is anything but step by step painting..,"I've been trying to find a book to learn how to paint digitally for a while now. I was hoping this could of been it according to the title. Since I'm a beginner with no real photoshop experience I need a simplistic step by step guide. I'm sure some of you have found it's really hard to find a book for us noobs. This book is not it. It contains many overviews into different artists thinking process. Most of them use multiple art/cad packages in this book. For example, one artist may use maya, 3d studia max and then photoshop. Who really has all those tools? There are only a few that cover photoshop alone and other than a glance into the thought process of a true professional you won't learn anything from this book. Seriously most of the step by step guides are one or two pages for something that may have taken the artist 24 hours to complete. Unfortunately this book was not for me."
2,Not so much painting as posing.,I was disappointed that the book featured mostly posed 3d model type illustration and offered little in the way of actually painting on the computer. Maybe the title should have been digital fantasy image creation techniques. Being a painter I was just offended that the poser files with some lighting and photo shop filters is classified as painting. There are some good examples in the book of his technique and there are a few varied techniques. I was just hoping for something more about painting specifically.
1,Junk,"There is nothing here of artistic or camp value, and certainly not nostalgia. Out of focus, overexposed junk. What a farce! When I think what this guy could have done...terrible disappointment."
5,Wacky and adorable,"I have to say, this is one of my all-time favorites. I've read Atkinson's ""Human Croquet"" and ""Behind the Scenes at the Museum,"" and they are every bit as good as everyone says they are.But I adore the way she takes off here -- the hilarious academic parody, the deft weaving of two or three different texts into a whole and the compelling emotional story at the core. I giggle my way through this book every time I read it, but its far better than just straight comedy. I don't even think you necessarily need to be aware of the various literary styles and methods of criticism she skewers to find the humor in the book -- her slacker undergrads are funny enough to entertain all by themselves. (Bob, the brainless Trekkie who spouts bits of philosophy in his sleep, is my favorite.)Please read it. I really think you'll like it, especially if are or ever were an English major.And don't be put off by the title...far as I can tell, it was picked out of a hat. Just ignore it."
3,Weird and funny,"I had a hard time getting into this book - too many characters introduced all at once and so briefly that I couldn't keep them straight. I'm glad I stuck with it though because about halfway through, I got drawn into the story and the strange and quirkly happenings. Atkinson is a really funny writer and I laughed outloud several times throughout the book. Although I really enjoyed the second half of the book, I was disappointed in the ending - well not the ending itself but the way the last chapter gives you all the answers to everything instead of giving more hints along the way so the reader could figure it out."
1,Emotionally Wierd - Kate Atkinson,"This book was a total load of rubbish. I have started to read it twice but after eventually arriving at page 103, I have had to put the book down as the story does not seem to be going anywhere."
2,Emotionallhy Weird,"This book was for my wife and was recommended by a friend, that obviously dosen't know her as well as she thought. Very hard read ."
3,Perspective Lost,"I had enjoyed ""Behind the Scenes at the Museum"" and ""Human Croquet"" so much that I eagerly anticipated Kate Atkinson's next release. I must admit, I'm a bit disappointed. Atkinson's unconventional yet compelling use of perspective has been present in all of her novels. However, in ""Emotionally Weird"", the story becomes completely buried beneath dozens of functionless characters and hazy motives. Her unique style... fresh and funny... shone through in her first two novels. Here it is lost to a weaker plot and gloomy scenery.I must admit that part of what may have alienated me (as a silly American)was the overwhelming presence of unfamiliar Scottish references. Whereas these same type of landmarks may have been present in ""Behind the Scenes at the Museum"", there they were made familiar and funny by their meaning to the more likable characters that she had created."
3,A modern Faulkner?,"This book is rather unconventional. While many others have each chapter be a different story with all the stories usually converging in the end, Ms. Atkinson takes 4+ stories and cuts and pastes them together in each chapter. Around 200 pages I almost quit reading as I was getting frustrated as I couldn't figure out what was real and what was just a story. After finishing the book I'm still not so sure if I know what was real. The obsession about the main charachters parentage is the main theme of this book and I'm pretty sure the conclusions are actually real and not a story the mother and daughter make up. I wish you all the best in reading this. I've never been a great appreciator of modern art and I suppose this is ""modern literature."""
2,Not very gripping,"I have read and loved 5 or 6 novels by Kate Atkinson but I couldn't finish this in spite of all the reviews advising readers to stick with it. Parts of it were interesting and funny, but the majority of it I found really tedious. I was more than halfway through the book when I decided I really didn't care if it all came together in the end, I was going on to something more entertaining."
2,Emotionally Weird,"I've read other books by Atkinson and enjoyed them. I'm finding it difficult to stick with this one as it's almost like reading a stream of consciousness, which makes it difficult to follow. However, Atkinson usually has a surprise ending so I would really like to hold my judgement until I've finished. It takes a dedicated reader to read this one.I gave only two stars because I've not finished the book yet; still waiting for the surprise!"
4,Weird but well worth the read,"Kate Atkinson is among my very favourite writers for her keen intelligence and wit, the economy and inventiveness of her language and her empathy with human frailty.It's all there in Emotionally Weird, but this is not the most satisfying of her novels, hence only 4 stars. I read it commuting on the train and often had to control the urge to laugh out loud, but it had the feel of a book she banged off between more important books. It's a testimony to her brilliance that even though she wasn't doing her best work here, it still engaged me thoroughly from first to last."
2,Better sources are available,"Kent Hovind is not a scientist, biologist, or archeologist. He was a Christian school teacher who begain collecting and compiling information and theories about creationism and evolution into a series of lectures and sermons. Some of what he has to say is good, while some is rejected by even creationists. Dr. Hovind is also a believer in conspirarcy theories regarding the UN, the US Government, and 9-11, and is a tax resister (which led to his conviction on tax evasion charges). While this has little to do with his work on creationism, it does call into question his credibility.If you want to research or study creationism, I recommend that you pass on Dr. Hovind's work and check out material by organizations like Answers In Genesis and Creation Ministries International. They employ real scientists and are much more reliable sources of creationist material."
2,No is a good Method,"I am new play the bass guitar,and this method is old,and the songs are very slow and easy, that no help to learn how the bass guitar is can be play, and excuse for my english."
4,Quiet but bulb is too yellow for me...,"Easy install and it makes absolutely no humming noise. I purchased this to go over my computer desk. However, the stock bulb was too yellow for my taste (15 watt, T8, 4100K). Went to Home Depot and bought a Philips 15 watt, T8, 5000K bulb (Natural Light) for $10, and it's almost perfect.I think the next color temp up would have been better for me, but it's a huge improvement over the stock bulb. White paper under the new bulb looks white, and the reflection doesn't hurt my eyes... maybe if I do go the next level up, it may be too bright. I'll keep the 5000K for now.Comes with screws for mounting. The bulb specs were NOT included the product description, and I had to upgrade the bulb, so -1 star."
4,Good CD writer but not so good software with it,"The CD writer is pretty impressive for its price. And it works so well, that you have to say 'Its a Sony!'. And installation is a snap with the documentation that comes with it.But for so good a writer the software that is bundled with it is B's recorder Gold. The faq for the software is poor and it recorded 2 bad CDs for me out of 5, before I switched to Nero Burning ROM. Since then my life has been much easier and all CDRs get burned nicely at top speed (24X) with no error whatsoever.Go for this if you want a fast, error-free CDRW which is a Sony. And if you happen to already have a burning software, then things cannot get better than this CDRW."
2,Good Sound - Need Better Songwriting,"This album was a disappointment. The band has perfected the alt.country sound as pioneered by Uncle Tupelo, but here they don't do much with it. There is not a single track that stands out, nor any memorable hooks to hang your hat on. Overall, a weak effort, though if they find a songwriting edge, subsequent albums might be special."
4,Simply Good,"Turnstiles grows on me each time I play it. Given better recording resources and support, these guys can certainly hold their ground along the likes of Son Volt or The Jayhawks. I would recommend all alt-country listeners to try it and hear it for themselves."
1,broke the first day,"My daughter got this for a gift for her 1st birthday, and it was broken by the time she went to sleep that night. Not durable at all."
3,Fun for a day,"My 1 year old loved the guitar for about 1 day. He loves musical things so I thought he would really enjoy this toy, but it didn't hold his interest beyond a few minutes at a time."
3,Cute but not very entertaining,"I ordered this for my son because he always tried grabbing his daddy's guitar when he was playing it. I figured that he should have one of his own. After playing with it for a few minutes he hasn't touched it. His grandmother bought him a mini guitar (with no lights, music... just wood and strings) and he likes that more. I don't know if it's just my son that gets bored to easily and wants big boy toys or if everyone will have the same problem. I'd say- give it a try and see if your baby likes it. I'm going to give it a go again and if he still doesn't like it I'll just put it away until later or another baby. Good luck with yours!"
4,Quite happy with this purchase,"This guitar is very nice. It was baught for my nephew, even though he may still be too young for it. It is smaller than i thought, but a good size for 9+ months. Has great sounds, and is quite entertaining :)"
4,"Cute, Kinda Small, Nice Sounds","It's cute. It's not the ultimate toy, after all, it is only $13. But, it does make noise (two options that change loudness and length of song). The sounds are familiar to youngins and they can jam to them. Little kids will like it because they can just hit it or drop it and the music will start again.I think it is actually quite small, the picture makes it look bigger.Bonus: They can be rock & roll and annoy their parents! =) JK folks."
5,Memory Lane,"I judge music by how it makes me feel, this music takes me back to good memories. Not because it was on at the time, but for me it recreates the atmosphere of a special holiday time somehow. Four friends cruising along the french riviera in a big car, cigars, wine, sun & fun. A feel of freedom and extreme leisure. It is fall now. Every time I put 'Reaching for a Star' on while driving in the rain I get home smiling like it were summer. I hope it works for you too."
1,The most boring movie that is made from a Shakespearean play.,This is just boring. It lacks excitement and is just a poor adaptation of the play. I read the play before watching this movie and some of the funniest parts are not realized becuase the actors and the sound and the location do not make it interesting. I would not suggest anyone watch this ever. This is as bad as Caligula.
3,Jarman's Tempest,"I will be teaching this play for a community college crowd next semester. I think it will work for that - more straightforward and less nudity than ""Prospero's Books."""
1,Dreadful,"I have read all of Shakespeare's plays, seen productions of a majority of them and even acted in and directed some. I do not necessarily believe that Shakespeare must be done in the ""traditional"" fashion, but I hated this movie.There is nudity that is gratuitous and unnecessary. There is grotesqueness that is far beyond what I believe Shakespeare intended. Some of the dialogue is incomprehensible, and there are those elements, like the singing and dancing that add no meaning to the movie, but replace Shakespeare with the director's self-indulgences.I am sorry to say that I wasted perfectly good money to buy the DVD of this movie."
2,failed purchase,"The ear plugs hurt my ears, when in use you I had to be facing the transmitter if you turn your head the sound would fade. A problem with IR, I got a pair with RF and I can got all through my house and still hear the sound."
1,Will not play on Samsung BD-P1000!,I purchased this knowing full well I'd likely have to update the firmware on my player. It won't play. Even after applying the latest firmware update from December 4th it still won't play. You can't even get to the menu screen.
3,It's okay,"Just finished- the wordage is a little old school, the plot doesn't go any where, though you hope it does. Good Christmas feelings though."
1,Disappointment abounds.....,"As an avid reader, I was extremely disappointed in this book. The writing was disjointed, there was not flow to the story, and the background of the people and their stories was practically nonexistant. It does have a good plot and what could be likable characters, but they are not fully explored enough for you to truly get to know them. There was also some violence against one of the main characters that was not pertinent to the story or necessary. While I do not wish to offend the writers, I would not waste my time with this one."
4,A magic librarian,"This book has a wonderful premise of how and what curses are and the people who fight them. It also has a three musketeer type man who ""recues"" the heroine."
2,Highly disappointed,"After reading Beneath the Web and Jeralyne, I pre-ordered this book thinking that I would encounter a high level of character development. The novel rambled on and I struggled to finish it. I thought that I might have been biased since the book initially had a modern setting, but I don't think that was true. I didn't care much about the protanganist. The two possible romantic interests were hardly addressed. The magical elements had promise, but again, the novel dragged. The book ends like there might be sequels, but I have no desire to read them."
4,Unusual Time travel concept,Kept me interested throughout. Unusual concept of time travel which seems to work well with the story. I also liked having a 50 something heroine for a change instead of a sweet young thing!
5,One of her best in a long time.,"I enjoyed this book more than I have any of Ms. Abbey's books in a long time (which is not to say I haven't enjoyed others - I buy and read them all). In contrast to another reviewer, I found the characters riveting, if annoying at times, and I was repeatedly surprised by what she did, as, for example, the relationship between mother and daughter. I look forward to the next one - and really hope there will be a next one."
4,Finally! Fantasy for grownups.,"Lynn Abbey is a well-established fantasy novelist best known for some pretty gritty fair -- Thieves World, Forgotten Realms, Magic, and the like. This is a book much closer to her -- a middle-aged, unassuming, well-educated woman from Ann Arbor, Michigan who just happens to travel through time fixing things. Her figure isn't perfect, her breasts aren't perky, she doesn't look fabulous in a leather bikini. Instead, she has a job, a house, civic commitments, dysfunctional family issues -- oh, and this whole time traveling thing. This is fantasy that I can relate to."
1,"Like a pilot idea for a TV series, the story lacks an ending","The story becomes somewhat more interesting as the plot shifts from the mundane life of a middle-aged woman to a supernatural connection linking contemporary characters and events to historical characters and events. I was hoping for more sci-fi to go with the supernatural theme, but didn't find it.Sadly, when the story runs its course, much of the mystery is unsolved and the roles of some seemingly important characters remain unclear. Even worse, last minute plots are introduced in a ""stay tuned for next week's episode"" way.Overall, this book introduces an imaginative idea for a story but it fails to support it with interesting details. Rather than telling a complete story, it seems that the author is setting you up to buy a sequel. I'm okay with serials and sequels, but prefer to have it disclosed on the cover."
2,better stick with American Prayer,"I was strongly dissapointed with this record. If you are expecting to find an album of Jim's spoken words, you are in for a big let down. This album's goal is only to make money off the Morrison name, consisting of various sound clips (usually only one word) from interviews, and recycled spoken words. I would recommend picking up American Prayer instead, aside from the sound collages performed by the remaining Doors, the chopping up of several poems and throwing in songs, it is a better collection of Jim's spoken words than this."
4,Not bad.,"I thought this wasn't bad, but I still like American Prayerbetter.By the way, is it just my imagination, or does Jim resembleCharlie Manson on the cover?"
5,Money well spent!,"I bought this Tamron lens 9 months ago and I've taken well over 30,000 pictures with it. I was debating between the Nikkor or the Tamron and it came down to cost. I've not been disappointed.If you've got the cash go for the Nikkor and sleep better knowing you own the best. I sleep better knowing my pictures rock just as hard and I saved a thousand bucks.Check out my blog and judge for yourself - if it's a wide shot it was this lens. And for that matter it's usually on an old D50! It's all about the lens.I did put out the cash for the Nikkor 70-200 2.8 - no regrets there either.[...]"
3,Great clarity but didn't last long,"I absolutely loved this lens until it broke. Fantastically sharp. Great for the price (I hope)I've had it since June and shot around 2000 pics. I was at a shoot over the weekend where I had a pro basketball player posing with a model and I get the warning on the back of my 40D that the lens is failing to communicate with the camera. This had happened twice before. Earlier, I'd wiped down the contacts and reattached the lens and kept shooting. This time; no change. Paperweight. Luckily, Tamron covers this with a 6 year warranty. I spoke with them. They were pleasant and told me exactly what to do. The lady at Tamron said it sounds like something came loose inside the lens. Now, it is going in for repair. I'm without my main walk around lens for up to 3 weeks. Will post the results when I get it back."
4,Borrow from the Library,"If you are looking to purchase a gift book for a child, I would suggest that you buy a Laurence Anholt book instead of this one. It did not hold my daughter's interest. We read it once, and we were done with it. I would not have felt bad about it if I had taken it out of the library. We did like seeing the artwork of Mary Cassatt, but it wasn't something that I would like to keep on my shelf permanently and take up space in my house. It was a nice way to introduce my daughter to Mary Cassatt, and she was able to identify the painter when we took her to the Philadelphia Museum of art. ""Mommy look - A Mary Cassatt! So, I would say that it was successful in that regard."
3,SEARCHING FOR ONESELF,"A young Japanese businessman must travel to Iceland, where his parents lived and then died, to perform a ritual for their burial. The film chronicles his confusing trek through Iceland where he gets drunk on a uniquely Icelandic alcohol and picks up hitchhikers (played by the excellent Fisher Stevens and Lili Taylor) who ultimately steal his car. An interesting and different concept which is good simply for its different approach."
5,Great 1st birthday present (boy or girl),"Someone gave this to our little girl and we made it our standard first birthday present. Not only do kids like it, but adults find the tunes catchy too. And they only last a few seconds - enough for the family to do a quick dance, but your kids won't wear you out.,"
2,Dissappointing,"I read this whole book that had me intrigued and I really thought it was very good. When I read the ending I was very dissappointed. The ending was dumb and pointless and didnt make any sense to me that it ended that way. In my opinion this book should not have gotten the high ratings that it got. I strongly suggest to everyone who loves romances novels not to read this one, you will be as dissappointed as I was."
4,A keeper!,"Six new chapters included in this edition... Access systems, CDMA, INAP, VOIP, ATM and ITU-T improvements are all here. Well presented, detailed, thorough references. A good book for looking up signaling details."
4,I like it a lot!,"Well written. Both this book and Manterfield's book are the best books in this area at the moment. It is clear the author is very technical skilled in Signalling, and this makes for a book that is easy to read and to understand. I do not think that if you wish to know about signalling/SS7 that you will be disappointed with buying this book."
5,Great Value!!,Bought this rash guard for my trip to Maui. It was perfect and at the right price. These do tend to run small - I would usually purchase a small as I wear a size 4 in tops but I purchased the medium and it fit perfectly. I also washed it a couple of times and it still looks like new.
5,Quality product! Saves my skin everytime even when I am in the pool.,The shirt does what it is supposed to. I just wish it wasn't so form fitting but you can't have everything everytime.
4,satisfied with product,"worn twice as of this writing. well-constructed, good fit, provides sun protection and additional warmth as advertised. satisfied so far. with good after-wear care hope to have it last for a few seasons. can give a positive recommendation for this product."
1,So marks for trying,All over the place - clashing genres - clashing acting styles. A bit of this and a bit of that. I bought it as a Mads Mikkelsen fan completing my collection but blink and you'll miss him. A film made by mates perhaps - just for laughs?
2,not so good vamp move,"it was good, but very confusing. i didnt like how it jumped from one story to another. the special fx was cool, and there was this one song i liked, but other than that, eh..."
3,Beware,I just rcvd this dvd 2day and i bought this one b/c it said the run time was 300 mins but thats a lie its only 60 mins. Beware
1,VERY disappointed,I ordered the dermablend and never recieved my package. I emailed the skin store and no one replied back so i tried to calll the customer service number to see if they could trace my package and no one answered the line. I had to make a complaint with Amazon and finallly recieved a refund. Bad Business
1,guideplus stinks- don't bother,"I don't have this model of RCA guide plus TV but do have another. The issues with having to constantly click off the guide plus as mentioned by an earlier reviewer are true. If you do a search of guide plus on the net you will find a plethora of customers who are struggling to reprogram their guideplus or who have lost programming altogether for at least a week because of programming issues. We can't select an input source for our PS2 for our kids because our remote broke. It will be at least $40! to get a replacement from some company I've never heard of! Stay away from guideplus and RCA- stay far, far away!"
1,guide plus sucks,"I think the TV has good picture quality but the Guide Plus thing [is bad]. It pops up every time you turn on the TV with a remote. Ive looked through every option and I dont think there's a way to prevent this. It's very annoying if you use a different remote and have to go back to the RCA remote every time just to turn the Guide Plus off. Also, It doesnt even work on half of the channels and the guide is a bad layout. It starts with news channels then goes to pay-per-view. You cant list them numerically."
5,Freckles are actually lighter!,I heard alot about Lumnaderm from reading up online and was anxious to try it since I have always wanted to reduce the freckles on my face. I can honestly say that it has really lightened the freckle spots on my face! I am so impressed and will continue to use Lumnaderm.
3,still have the blemishes,the cream didn't work for my wife...but we were able to get a refund without any problems. Thanks.
1,Did Not Work!!!!!,I have hyperpigmentation (dark spots) on my face and was excited to try this product. I used this product EVERY day - Morning and Night for 30 days (the jar is empty). Absolutely no results!!!!
4,Farm Work,"It's hard to believe that an author,Don Kurtz, could write a most interesting book about doing farm work. This is a good read. Kurtz does a masterful job of creating and describing the central character, Gerry Maars. Gerry Maars is energetic, social,greedy, devious, vengeful, generous, public spirited and a host of other adjectives all to the Nth degree. In the end he a failureArthur Conason, the protagonist doesn't always measure up.He has a great capability for hard work and taking charge when necessary. He is the perfect hired man. He seems to have a talent for attracting all the wrong women, and then having the affair end up badly. He cannot make a full time commitment.Ralph Ekwallralphomaha@yahoo.com"
4,"Good regional fiction, set in Indiana","Kurtz's novel is about farmers trying to make a living, but generally failing. Arthur Conason comes home to the deserted farm and begins helping Gerry Maars plant and harvest corn. There's a drifter quality about him, though, that prevents him from committing to anything; he loses out with a woman he might have married. Maars goes broke, but Conason prevents his suicide at the end. Kurtz does a good job creating interesting characters who keep our interest throughout the novel. Well done."
4,Feel the flow,"One of the unquestioned masters of African musical propulsion, Kuti delivered time and again when it came to his pioneered brand of taut, percussive-heavy, horn-based funk stretched out across the laid back palate of Nigerian-styled guitar to cultivate the afro-beat sub genre all for himself. In these long, thrusting compositions, the focus always stays sharp even if the mood becomes a little playful or repetitive. This makes for that rare combination that can hold as much value for the pessimistic listener as an optimistic one."
5,free kuti!,"this is one of my many ""matt houser recommends"" albums in my collection. come to think of it, i really don't know which fela kuti albums he told me to buy, but this is the one (i have four in total) that i really caught on to. if you don't know anything about fela, well, do some research. he's a really intriguing guy. there's some really great stories included with the re-issues (not to mention, most of the re-issues are combinations of TWO fela records). anyway, the music is real freaked out jazz/funk/reggae, with african lyrics usually political in nature. his shows were supposedly these amazing visual productions with choreographed dancers and such, and from what i hear, his son femi is following in daddy's footsteps with equally stunning performances (but maybe not quite an amazing song writer)..."
2,Surprisingly good story.,Too bad no one wanted to research good si-fi. Entertaining. I don't think I really have 10 more words to say.
2,"So-So, not the best I've ever seen.","I had this book, but donated it to my local charity shop. I've seen better cookie collections, and in fact, only made 3 or 4 of the recipes. Why? Because there are variations of the same recipes, just with one or two different ingredients.With the rise of the internet, there are thousands of cookie recipes to be found, so who needs a run-of-the-mill book with not a lot of variety?"
5,Mrs. Fields Best-130 Delicious Cookie and Dessert Recipes,"I have just received my sixth copy of Mrs. Fields Best Cookie Book Ever. My daugher found it at the library-very old, yellow, torn. She and her daughters were writing recipes and trying recipes from it and they are delicious. Maybe this is an old cookbook but it keeps up with modern times. Now all my daughters and two granddaughters have it. What a rare find! Most were brand new and bought used and were in perfect condition. Most not even out of wrappers."
5,Cookie Lovers -- This is the book for you!,"I am a real cookie monster and more than eating cookies I love to bake them for others to enjoy and ooh and aah over. This book contains some of the most awesome recipes and they are so simple!!! There are more than cookies in here though. You'll find recipes for bars, cakes, and more. This is an essential for anyone with a sweet tooth."
2,Terrible,"Having made many batches of cookies in my day, I had a feeling that the recipes I read in this book had weird proportions and baking times. But I gave it a shot; I figured cookie mogul Mrs. Fields knew what she was talking about more than I did.Wrong. My cookies were burned and nasty after the first batch and, after altering the dough myself, came out only to the point of being passably edible. I should have followed my instincts.Stick with a recipe site where you can read comments and reviews from others, don't buy this book. Wasted my time and money."
5,OMG you have to read this book!!!!!!,"OMG----- I was fliping thew a DDBC Mag one day looking for a new book when I came across a picture of this book, I thought oooo interesting... so I ordered... 2 weeks later I got it and could not put it down!! it is one the the best books I have in my collection (and I mean colletion!) If you loved Harry Potter and you Love V.C. Andrews you are gonna love this book... I promise!! Libba, Please write a sequal!!!"
4,intriguing Victorian coming-of-age,"I picked this up thinking it was a fantasy, but although it has some fantasy elements, I wound up particularly liking the sharp dialogue and perceptive analysis of the relationships among teenage girls. Through their words and actions, the girls demonstrate that although many things have changed since the Victorian era -- such as what women can and cannot expect from their lives -- many aspects of adolescence (cliques, rebellion, emerging self-understanding) haven't changed a bit. The fantasy part actually struck me as a bit weak, though that may be partly because (not knowing it was the first part of a trilogy) I read the whole book expecting things to be resolved and explained at the end. Instead, the end feels more like a beginning, but I look forward to the next installment."
5,Wicked!!!!,I saw the book is the local bookstore and because I had recently compleated a project on female fashions was totally hooked in by the cover. I started it and oh my giddy god it is so(...) etc. good. Please read it. It brought up interesting issues and was fun!
2,Oh so very lame!,"I really wanted to like this book. I read through all the fluffy language, the annoying ramblings of the heroine, and the really lame love story only to wish that I stopped at the end of the first chapter like I wanted to in the beginning. Teenage girls ages 12-15 might find it entertaining though, I but I personally did not."
2,Disturbing Gothic Mediocrity,"I had high hopes for this book... It begins with some beautifully imagery, but jumps right into action before you know the main character at all. I found it difficult to force myself to finish this book. The plot seems to lack direction. I kept waiting for something to happen that wasn't completely predictable. The underlying dark current of the book is disturbing, almost remisniscent of a fantasy version of 'Lord of the Flies', but at a girls boarding school. It definitely wasn't romantic either, unless you consider a teen girls sweaty dreams of a boy touching her breasts romantic. I won't be reading the sequels. I have to say I should have given it a three star rather than a two...but the program won't let me change that."
3,Interesting but disturbing,"This book is definitely different, now what I expected to find in the children's section. There is enough sexual content that I would reluctant have children read it. They should definitely limit this to the teen section."
3,good ideas stilted execution,"My 14 year old finished this book last weekend and absolutely loved it. I am a devotee of childrens' literature so I gave it a try expecting to like it also. But ultimately, I was disappointed. Ms Bray has some interesting characters, and has done her homework, but the writing itself seemed stilted and ""by-the-book"" at times - especially her descriptions of nature and surroundings. I felt the atmosphere had been done before - and better - in the Harry Potter series.I did enjoy her cast of characters, but they too, were a mix of too modern and ""done before"". Still it is a page turner, which is why I gave it the 3 stars and would recommend it.I'm sure - by the open ended conclusion - that a sequel is on its' way. My 14 year old will be thrilled."
3,Just couldn't believe it,"I wanted to love this novel, I truly did. After all, it's written by a fellow Brooklynite and it's about topics I enjoy: psychic powers and female bonding. But, ultimately, I found this book only mildly satisfying, mostly because the action just isn't believeable, even for a story about the supernatural. The novel has some good points, which is why I give it three stars, but it certainly promises far more than it delivers. If you are interested in the interpersonal dynamics among young people, and also enjoy an element of mystery in your novels, try instead The Secret History by Donna Tart, which is a truly first-rate novel and far surpasses this pedestrian effort from Libba Bray."
5,historical fiction,this is the best teen historical fiction series I've ever read and I wish I could find more books as good as these!
4,Pleasantly Addictive,"Recommended by my sister....and loved it! I admit that the intended audience seems a bit young, but overall I was completely immersed in the story, development, and mysticism."
2,Terrible Ending,"This trilogy was wonderful! The novels were well thought out, with wonderful characters, plot, conflict, and lovely tension. However, by the end of it crazy things started happening. In the third book these relationships suddenly change in an incredibly forced way, as if the author suddenly decided she needed to portray a more diverse set of characters and situations to widen her fan base. The lesbian action seems forced, thrown in, and unbelievably sudden. It wasn't believable for the reader.Also, the SPOILER!!!!:The way Kartik died was unforgiveable!!! It may seem juvenile and ridiculous but unless the novel is post-apocalyptic, I want a HEA. This trilogy steals that away."
5,glad i kept reading..,"This book was a bit boring for me at first. I thought several times about just putting it down, and not continuing to read. I'm glad I didn't. Towards the middle..it just got extremely good. Then, I couldn't imagine putting it down! I read greedily, turning pages quickly, devouring every word. I'm so glad I kept on reading! I just ordered the other two books of the trilogy and can't wait to get my hands on them!"
4,"Great writing, great story!","I bought this for my 15-year old stepdaughter, and was compelled to read it myself because the synopsis on the back was so intriguing. I'm a sucker for Gothic-type mysteries with a touch of the supernatural, and Gemma, the protagonist, is so real and down-to-earth that you can't help but like her. This is quality writing for young adult readers. As an aspiring author of young adult novels myself, I'm of the strong opinion that talking down to young people - as many YA authors do - is insulting and certainly unncessary. I'm 35 years old and found this book to be as well-written and entertaining as anything in the adult mainstream market. Recommended."
2,lackluster read.,"After hearing tons and tons of praise for the Gemma Doyle Trilogy on Goodreads I thought that I would pick up the first one from the library. I have to say that I was pretty disappointed with the book as a whole and will not be picking up the other two anytime soon. Overall the story seemed contrived, predictable and rather boring, I will say that this could be because I don't like the fantasy genre usually but I am just telling you how I felt. This was a major disappointment too as this was my first YA book in a very long time and I was hoping to have this one help me back into the genre."
3,Gothic mystery at a girls' school,"1895: 16 year old Gemma (English, but raised in India) has a fearful vision of her mother's death. She doesn't know if the vision was true, but her mother actually dies around the time Gemma has her vision. Gemma is sent to a girls' school in England, where she had been begging to go. It is nothing like she thought it would be. She is not used to the cruel way the girls adhere to the unwritten, rigid pecking order. She has no friends. And then she finds a diary of a long-dead schoolgirl, who has plenty of secrets of her own. This is an interesting premise. I got a little lost in the narrative scenes, a little too abstract for me, I guess. And, I had a hard time believing this was the 19th century. Too many anachronisms. This has all the components of a gothic mystery set at a secluded English girls' school: magic, sneaking around at night, lots of secrets, secret societies. A fair book."
5,The most compelling book I've read in 15 years!,"A Great and Terrible Beauty is a profound exploration of a young woman's self discovery. A chest full of self revelating treasures, Gemma's struggles and thought processes bring to life the difficulties faced by young and old women alike. The resonating idea that there are no good or bad choices but never ending opportunities, doors of light, presenting themselves throughout life, challenging us to believe in our own strength and know the desires within that make us individuals."
2,Mediocre,"Although almost all of the characters are supposed to be 19th century English, they routinely display the sensibility of 21st century Americans. (I am American.) I found Gemma irritating, and her all-important visits to the ""realms"" boring. Many of Gemma's experiences are supposed to be frightening, but they were just dull. Most annoying, the book left several loose ends, which, I imagine, the author intends to address in one or more sequels that I do not expect to be reading. The identity of the villain, as yet undisclosed, seems obvious."
2,Neither great nor terrible,"""The Craft"" in turn-of-the-century London. I enjoyed it while I was reading it, but the climax was pretty rote, diminishing everything that came before it. A tad Harlequiny at time as well. The protagonist's friends are too unlikable, and there's no character growth. And it's all kind of overly-protracted, which you don't mind so much until there's no satisfying payoff.There's a Q&A; at the end with the author who says things like ""I could tell you, but then I'd have to kill you,"" which of course only makes matters worse."
4,"A great, and not so terrible, beauty of a book","Libba Bray's voice in this novel was an addicting one. A Great and Terrible Beauty is wonderfully interesting the whole book through, and the beautiful choice of words is what made the novel a page-turner. Bray really kept my interest, and when I finished, I picked it up and read it again. The characters are fascinating, and the plot, though hard to believe, is an entertaining one. A Great and Terrible Beauty is a magical novel that will leave you wanting more."
5,"Amazing, Beautiful, yet Scary","A Great and Terrible Beauty is amazing, beautiful, and scary all at the same time. Libba Bray does an amazing job of depicting the Victorian Age and Gemma's supernatural visions. I WOULD NOT recommend this book, however, to a person under 12. I would highly recommend it to anyone else, though."
5,A Real Gem!,"I'll get strait to the point - I loved this book!I found that it was beautifully written and that the characters were extremely real; imperfect, each with an individual and complex personality.I found the overall effect of the book was stunning and left me longing for more. Perhaps part of the attraction for me was how easilly i could relate to Gemma and her way of thinking, for me, it was almost like reading a book about myself!But if you are a fan of historical novels with corsets set in English girls boarding schools; dark fantasy; exotic and handsome young men; very real main characters and a writing style that is both witty and beautiful then give this book a go!I'm serious! It's one of my favourite teen books and it has messages(carried throughout the trilogy)that i think all young women should read.I highly reccomend it!An excellent first novel Libba Bray!"
4,An irresistable read about society and magic,"I picked up this book because of the interesting cover (which I totally love) and intriguing plot. It didn't dissapoint me. I loved reading about the culture and the first person angle was a good choice for such an emotional and intricate setting. All of the characters are fully imaginable and their fears and triumphs enjoyable. the only reason this didn't get five stars was that the last one hundred or so pages seemed poorly written compared to the others. My interest declined, but by the end of the book, I was begging for more!. I would love to see this made into a movie."
2,"wonderful title, less satisfying tale","Though the author handles the boarding school setting well, the magical elements in the book are poorly handled and frankly confusing. The reader has little sense of Kartik's function--why is he warning Gemma not to succumb to her visions? Gemma's mother's current connection with the magical ""realms"" is never clear, nor does the reader have any good sense of why she was murdered. The book showed promise, but frankly I was so confused by parts of it, I couldn't be ""moved"" or chilled. I was simply happy that it ended. The sardonic first-person present-tense narration is grating and does not suit the late-nineteenth- century setting. True, the author has used some appropriate vocabulary--""ninny"" etc.--but many of the girls' conversations did not ring at all true, sounding far too modern. In the end, I regret having wasted my time with this book. Not recommended."
5,I love these books,"These two books are deffanitly number one of my book choices (the Stravaganza series being second, hp third) these first two book where full of magic and enticment... i love them!!!!!!!"
1,"Dull, Dull...","Since this book got decent reviews, I thought I would give it a try. Turns out the book was dreadfully boring. It took forever to get into the story, and once you were in the story, it was a little too fiction for common sense. I had higher expectations for the book and I was disappointed. Unless you like boring school girls and snotty cliques, this book will not interest you at all. Some parts were alright, but the majority of the book was monotonous. This would be a great buy if you are looking for a book to read when you are trying to fall asleep."
1,A great and terrible book,"There are very few books that I meet that I don't like, this would be the second one. It was terrible. I know the author was thrilled with her research about the period, but I thought it was lame. I'm not a huge history fanatic, but even I knew the basics about corsets and button hooks fot shoes. And I find the relationship with the gypsy absurd. I can't imagine no matter how ill behaved a young Victorian lady may have been she would have never allowed herself to fall in love with a gypsy.The parts in the story where they cross over were quite lacking in description. All I could sense was a white haze with your own character description choice plopped in, since there was none to reference.I found myself to like the description of the author more enjoyable than the book."
1,Not so Great and a little Terrible,"I was really excited for this book, after reading many good reviews it seemed like it would be great. I got it from the library only to find it to be a major let down.I didn't feel connected with the people, and some twists in the book make no sense at all.Also, the fantasy/magic parts were often too dull to read the whole part. I found myself skimming and skipping pages.Although not the worst book I've read, it was hardly worth all the excitment."
4,victorian novel with modern twists,"Libba Bray has managed to incorporate all the great elements of a Vicorian gothic novel, using modern language and concepts while still maintaining Victorian gothic settings.The characters are what makes this novel so engrossing and relatable. Although, as written by others, it is fairly obvious that a sequel or series is on the horizon. (Or there should be a sequel as many loose ends need to be tied up, much to the reader's frustration.)Definitely for a wider audience than young adult, but parents should note that younger readers may encounter some mature themes - so it wouldn't hurt to preview the book before your child reads it.I will look forward to reading more from this author and will enjoy meeting up with these characters again."
5,Exceptional and sooooo good,"A Great and Terrible Beauty is an excellent novel, brilliantly written with a great and clever plot. The book is a combination of fantasy, history, and a very yummy romance =]. It takes place in the victorian age (1895 to be exact), which adds an unexplainably quaint atmosphere to the story. When I read it, I was utterly captivated, and it is impossible to explain the excellence of this flawless book. It is definitely a page turner, and I liked it even better than Harry Potter, which has been my favourite book and obssesion for the past four years. It will leave readers upset that the story is over, and desperately waiting for the sequel. I recommend this to everyone and anyone searching for a nice fiction novel to read. Five stars!!!!!!!!!!! SOOOOOO GOOOD!"
5,This trilogy is a must read!,"I highly recommend this trilogy. It is different from other paranormal books. No vampires or werewolves. Gemma is quite funny. This series have everything: death, honor, caste, dreams, visions, success, addiction, love, romance, and more."
2,Meh..,"The story had promise but the execution left something to be desired. It took almost half the book for anything to happen. Then, the backstory was more interesting than the story being told. It wasn't until the last 10% of the book that I was truly interested. I really feel like some more editing would have made this a winner. At this point I don't know if I care to even read the next book!"
5,Amazing,"When a friend told me of this series, I decided to give it a try. It started out boring, and I was uninterested.But I kept reading it, and after the first 50 pages, it got MUCH better. I loved the honesty that Gemma has, the relationship of all the characters, as well as the believable-magic plotline. It is definitely one of the best books I've ever read, and I would recommend it to anyone and everyone who enjoys magic, adventure, romance and suspence. It was WAY better than I would have expected! The rest of the series is just as good, if not better.I had never heard of Libba Bray before, but now love her!"
5,Loved the series!,"This is one of my favorite trilogies so far. I loved Gemma's character and the love story between her and Kartik. At times the other characters, Felicity and Ann, were a little annoying but they are teenage girls in a boarding school. It's a great book and I couldn't put it down!"
4,A great and beautiful book,"It took me so long to decide to finally read this book! People would tell me about it, and it really didn't seem that interesting. Once I actually read this book, I devoured it! This book has a little for everyone...fantasy, history, realistic fiction... I think that if you like any of those genres, you should definitely give it a try. If you don't like it, I'm sorry, but if you do, it is the first in an equally wonderful trilogy!"
5,What Can I Say,"So I bought this book Saturday afternoon and fell asleep at five am the next morning, 350 pages into it. Finished it right after church. If that doesn't say that it's a good book, what does? No, good means nothing. Exceptional doesn't begin to describe the emotion and the engrossing depictions that pin to you your cozy, reading chair and multi-demensional characters that speak right through you. And how about that Kartick? As if we don't all know what it's like to see someone you feel for who may be checking out your friend, but you know that there's a connection. POkay, so maybe we haven't experienced it quite like that, but you know what I mean. It's so real and the present-tense writing style is beyond magnificent. I don't know that I've ever read a book so impeccable."
5,A Must Read!!!!,"A Great And Terrible Beauty is a novel from a young woman named Gemma Doyle's point of veiw. Gemma was born and raised in India. Sounds exotic and adventurous, right? Well not to Gemma. She hates the extreme weather and crazy vendors trying to sell her cobras for her birthday dinner. She longs to go to London, and exceeds in this after she sees her mother murdered by a monstourous prescence, called Circe.At her new boarding school in London,, Spence, she gets entangled in the lies and shcemes of some of the schools most powerful girls. After sharing a dangerous secret with the leader of this posse, she is accepted into their group, and they embark on a journey so mysterious, and so disastourous, it could take their lives any minute. But Gemma has a power that can defeat the evil, but how does she use it??You must must must read this book!!!! It is so surprising and exciting, humorous, and fantastico!"
3,Meh,"I was book hunting and heard some great things about this book, buuttttt it wasn't as great as I had hoped. It starts out boring, gets interesting (but not I can't put the book down, interesting) and only juicy at the end."
3,A Great and Terrible Beauty,"I feel like this book was mostly a love or hate sort of book, before I read it. However, I found A Great and Terrible Beauty to be quite average. It was neither outstanding nor had any ""bad"" qualities that made me really dislike it. However, it didn't pull me in as much as I wished it would, and I feel satisfied that I wasn't on the ""love it"" side or the ""hate it"" side, as I feel most are. There were quite a number of ""plot points"" that I didn't fully understand, but at least I was entertained by the story, the time period, and especially the ending. This is one of those times where you'll really need the ""liked"" and ""disliked"" section of this review to understand my feelings on this book.Read the specifics?[...]~Thalia Anderson"
4,Good book,"This series is an easy, yet entertaining read. I am 27 years old and enjoyed reading them. They are also good books for teenagers."
1,Disappointing,"I have to say that I am completely shocked by all of the positive reviews for this book. The basic idea wasn't so bad, but the one dimensional characters and absolutely horrendous writing were too much. I had to literally MAKE myself finish this book."
1,Not a good read,I was drawn in by all the 4s and 5s this book received on amazon. But it was a terrible read and a complete waste of time. She spends so much time foreshadowing and not enough time answer questions. I could barely plow through the entire book. It was such a bad read that I don't even care if I learn how it really ends. I've been disappointed once with the first book and will not waste a penny of a second acquiring books 2 or 3.
1,"Titillating, but that's about it.","The only time this book was fully engaging was when Gemma was crossing the lines of acceptable sexuality in thought or action. Then the narrative felt seductive--dangerous and forbidden. But that's like putting chocolate coating on a mangy, dog-eared house shoe. I could have cared less about the heroine on either side of those episodes. Titillation just is not good enough.So the book pushes boundaries.Let's not celebrate that.Celebrate that when it comes *with* solid writing, characters you embrace and new worlds or ideas to explore.Fair warning. There's not any of that here."
3,Booboos in the Timeline,"This was fun escapism though maybe not the healthiest ideas about the occult for the young target audience. The technical errors were distracting for me. For example, the quote ""God is in the details"" is from Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, the famous architect who wasn't born until 1886. Also, the main character refers to a hologram, which wasn't invented until 1947. I'm surprised the editor didn't catch the mistakes. They made it hard for me to take the book seriously."
1,TERRIBLE,This would have been a good book if not for the same sex omplications. I do not know why the author felt the need to add this in. I would not recommend this to anyone.
2,A decent book for pre-teen girls.,"This book was ok, good but not great. I think what kept me reading was that it would have been a book I would have loved when I was around 11 or 12-years-old. I loved the whole ""boarding school"" genre when I was around that age. It is definitely a book written for children or teens. As children's books go it was pretty good. The story is interesting and the characters are very real to life."
3,It was alright,"It was alright, not as good as the twilight series, and especially not as good as Harry Potter. It didn't really catch me like the others. I wake up and I wasn't in a hurry to read what was going to happen next. It was good, I guess. Sure I recommended it but dnt get too excited."
4,"At times amazing, at times baffling.","This book series, I read when I was a young teen. I'm now a little older and have reflected upon these books. I've come to this conclusion, they are good but they could have been BETTER. The writing could have been sharper, more clever, and more authentic to the time period. However, the story is incredible, original, and you find yourself sympathizing with the characters. I've read AGATB twice, and I'm almost halfway through RA for the second time. The Sweet Far Thing is also impeccable, but again, not authentic as far as dialogue is concerned. Highly recommended to young people to introduce them to Victorian-esque literature."
3,Pretty good series,"This is a series of romance, adventure, and mystery. The story is great. 4 friends embark on a crazy journey and learn about each other and themselves. Who should you trust? Are people what they seem? Should you conform to society? What is right and what is wrong? What is good and what is evil? These are some of the questions this series brings up. The only real problem i have with these books is their length. Some books are required to be lengthy because the story needs that. These books are long and they don't necessarily need to be. That's why it is getting 3 stars. A great read nonetheless..."
4,Very intriguing,"Ok...so I just finished the ""Twilight"" series by Stephanie Meyer not too long ago. And I have been going through withdrawls---(her books are amazing if you haven't read them yet) And this book was reccommended to me by my dear sister who reads everything! I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed reading A Great and Terrible Beauty. It has such wonderful characters that you really feel like you get to know, and a very interesting story line. I can't wait to start the sequel Rebel Angels now! Highly recommended--especially if you loved the Twilight books :)"
5,A Great and Beautiful Book!,"After reading my favorite book the North Kingdom, I found it difficult to find another book that I wanted to read. Luckily, I came across A Great and Terrible Beauty and what a treat it was to find. It is set in my favorite era the Victorian Age and takes place at a school for young ladies to help them become society's women and marriageable prospects. Gemma quickly finds herself on the ins with the popular girls. There is the usual mischief that adolescents find themselves in drinking sneaking out, but Gemma and her friends soon learn about a secret order that used to exist at the school many years before until a terrible fire occurred resulting in two deaths. And Gemma has the power to bring it back as she is able to enter the realm. This novel is both intriguing and a delight to read. I had trouble putting it down and even before I was finished with it I went out and bought the sequel. So read A Great and Terrible Beauty today, you won't be disappointed!"
5,awsome book,"when i first read the summary of this book i was a little skeptical about it, but was i ever wrong. this book was a wonderful srory of magic, mean school girls, love and the need to belong, and it all took place in the victorian time period. This book was great. i can't wait to read rebel angels. I definently recommend this book. it is a must read"
3,A Great and Terrible Beauty,"I found A Great and Terrible Beauty to satisfy my love of fantasy-related stories. The theme of ""Be careful what you wish for, it may come true"" was properly expressed with the engaging and humorous characters in the story. Gemma Doyle is a heroine that most girls could probably relate to, along with a few of the other characters as well. As you read the story, you may find that her helplessly romantic desires can also make her believable. The whole idea to this story was very good, and that is why I recommend you give it a try."
2,Boring,"My two biggest problems with this book were that it was extrememly boring and I felt that the author didn't really have a good enough grasp on her own ideas about this thing called the ""realms"" and all that it entails to get a clear understanding across to the reader."
5,A must read!,"this is the most amazing book that i have read. this book got m back into reading after i had this phase where i didnt feel like reading. the excitement adventure, and suspense will keep you up late into the night!"
3,"Even if you're not Wow-ed by this, you'll want to complete the trilogy","3.5 StarsGemma Doyle desperately wants to leave India and live in her home country that she never knew, England. And when her mother dies, she gets her wish and is enrolled at a boarding school in England. She leaves India with her father, and finds her older brother who had been sent to England previously changed.Boarding school life isn't what Gemma had imagined, with cliques and a social outcast for a room mate. What frightens Gemma however, are the visions she started having right before her mother died and which seem to be increasing.There is also the fact that a boy has been following her, all the way from India. When he does choose to speak to her, it only leaves her mystified.An interesting read; the kind you can finish in a day."
3,Not great or terrible,"This one was just okay for me.My only real probelm with it is that it was kind of slow. I kept waiting for things to pick up, but it didn't really happen. There was a little bit of action, but it wasn't as exciting as I expected.There were good things about it too. Libba Bray's writing is great. Her descriptions make things so easy to visualize, and the concept is fantastic. The Realms, the magical place Gemma and her friends discover, are amazing. This book has the potential to be a great story; it just doesn't quite make it. However, it is good, and it's worth the time and money.I would also like to say that this is the first in a trilogy, and the second one is great and much more action-packed. You will need to read this one so that you understand what's going on in the next two books. This one is kind of slow, but it has to give you the ""background"" parts. I would recommend this one so that you can get to the others."
5,Enchanting,"Libba Bray's style of writing is beautiful and descriptive, making it easy to get lost in the pages. This is a spell-bounding story that takes you on a mysterious journey with Gemma and a trio of her closest friends. With romantic undertones of a love affair brewing and questions left unanswered, you'll be eager to delve into the next installment of the trilogy."
1,The author got the facts wrong.,"With respect to the author's claim that the first Apollo lunar landing was almost a major blunder, he got the facts all wrong. He doesn't cite his exact references or data sources to back up his claims. The book is entertaining reading and it tells a tale, but can you believe his assertions? Is this book, in part ""junk science"" that will itself perpetuate half truths?"
1,deeply flawed book,"As a layman I am offended at the bad scholarship of this book. The author conveniently did not allow his credentials--obviously he is uneducated--to be placed on the back cover. If I had written this book I would want to remain unknown also.The book is filled with assertions--NO FOOTNOTES!--that are untrue. His ignorance of the history of science, the history of philosophy and the history of religions make this book a complete waste of money. I hope I can return it.Buy some other book. Anything but this one. Hopefully it will soon go out of print."
4,Titled for sales to the wrong audience,"I suspect many of those who bought this book did so in the hope that it would contain arguments to denigrate science in favor of their own religious/pseudoscientific beliefs. Its effect is just the opposite. It points out clearly that science is a dynamic and testable process that continuously revises and upgrades itself, often to the demise of previously widely subscribed notions where pseudoscience knows no error in itself and thereby is condemned to be erroneous. The author may not be an expert in the details of all the fields he discusses (and who could be?) but his analytic approach is on the mark. It is no wonder that those who are uncomfortable the notion of a changing paradigm are eager to downrate it, they just don't get the point."
1,boring and incorect,"This book is very disappointing, on average there is an error on every page. This makes the arrogant tone with which he describes 'blunders' even more annoying. The author has obviously no idea what he writes about. Don't buy this book."
3,"well, not exactly","do not expect some kind of a breath taking find in the book, the name of this book should be more of a breif history of scientific misconseptions.good book for easy reading and popular science history, no more but no less as well. nice book to have on the shelf."
1,beware!,"this product is advertised as ""natural"" but is far from it.you cannot that from the website, but once you order the product and see the ingredients label, you find out that it has methyl and propyl parabens just like most other regular shower gel products."
2,Guide lacks substance,I was very disappointed with this directory since I feel it failed to cover a number of accommodations. Compared to the AAA guides it is lacking in substance.
4,Soulful Crooner,"The soulful crooning of Jeff, with his Sinatra smoothness, blends a laid back lounge sound with a little jazz and some up-beat, almost rock-a-billy numbers. This CD plays great against the backdrop of murmuring voices at a cocktail party or in the darkness of your own room, nursing Jack Daniels and lamenting the day you ever met him/her while the ironic lyrics feed your soul. These guys are great live and it translates well to disc."
4,Very Interesting & Very Realistic Romance,"Very interesting, very realistic romance. Not your typical hero. The author allows us to see the good, the bad and the ugly and I still grew to love him anyway. The heroin is a normal, fairly intelligent, a little insecure woman. Their worlds intersect many times and their relationship grows in many different ways. Many developments were unexpected. It's not a sweep you off your feet romance; it's more of a slow progression. After much turmoil is does eventually end up with a HEA. It kept me interested, but I didn't have a problem putting it down when I needed to. Overall, it was a good, well written read with very few typos."
5,Love-love-loved this book!,"This is a wonderful love story and more. Weir's writing style is topnotch - she has a way of developing her characters that makes you really feel you understand them - Johnny's tormented soul and the loneliness of Maggie and her fear of letting someone into her safe and predictable life. Weir does this with a concise writing style with dialogue between the characters that seems very real, very normal. I am so glad to have found a great author in this genre and will most definitely be checking out anything else she has written. Superb!"
5,Volume three not until 2008 or so,"A truly outstanding series on the players, economics, politics and strategy (or lack thereof) of the Hundred Years War. To describe it as definitive is perhaps insufficient praise.According to correspondence with the UK publisher, Faber & Faber, the demands of the author's day job as a QC (lawyer) will likely mean a 2-3 year delay before volume three (I write this in July 2005). It will almost certainly be worth the wait though."
5,"Andrew Mayhem, chapter one","If the words Andrew Mayhem don't make you automatically pick up the book and start reading, they will after you finish Graverobbers Wanted (No Experience Necessary.) It is impossible to read this story and not become completely enthralled with the Mayhem character.By the author of the wildly popular Pressure, Dweller, and Benjamin's Parasite, Graverobbers Wanted demonstrated early on that Jeff Strand is a master storyteller. Dark and humorous, this mystery-action-thriller will hold you until the last page, and leave you still wanting more.And thankfully, there is more! Further Andrew Mayhem adventures can be found in:Single White Psychopath Seeks SameCasket for Sale (Only Used Once)Suckers (with J A Konrath)No matter how many smash hits Jeff gives us, Graverobbers Wanted will always hold a special place, being my introduction to the author's twisted genius. I can only hope we one day see the often promised further adventures of Andrew Mayhem."
3,it was okay,i've read other titles by Strand which i liked a lot more. this one wasn't something that kept me interested.
3,Good silliness,"This is a fun, near slapstick detective novel. When a pretty woman offers the 'hero?' of the story money to dig up a grave in the middle of the night, you know it's not going to be simple or end quickly. When the hero has to take his kids around and is afraid of what his wife will say, you know you have a winner."
4,Fun,"This was my first JS book and loved it. Had me laughing out loud one minute and on the edge of my seat the next. Good plot, good flow, good ending."
5,Too funny!,"Love this author! I had never read any of his work until I read ""Wolf Hunt"" (which is hilarious by the way) and now I am working my way through all of his books. This story is about Andrew Mayham and his friend Roger, both low on cash until a beautiful woman asks them to dig up her husband...and the humor carries on from there."
1,Slow after good start,After a good start with one or two laughs the story and the narrative looses its grip. I had to really force myself to finish the book.
1,Disappointed,"I was hopeful, considering the calibre of referrees this author had. But I have tagged this book to remind myself not to read anymore mayhem books. Predictable, terribly disappointing attempts at humor, and hard to finish."
1,HATED IT!!,This is awful from the get go. I hate the characters. I hate the plot. I will never read anything by this author again.
4,Good fun for sick minds,"Tired of the unrelentingly grim heroes of dark suspense? Bored with tough-talking macho PI types? Need a good laugh in a book about dead bodies, torture, murder, and worse? Then read Graverobbers Wanted (No Experience Necessary), which deftly manages to juggle some truly gut-wrenching situations with laugh-out-loud funny stuff."
3,Didn't live up to my expectations,"I collect Blenko glass, and I got this book with the expectation that it would help me distinguish Blenko from the other WV glassmakers. The book is full of wonderful photographs, but there is only so much to be learned from a two dimensional object. There is a brief history of each glassmaker, and therein lies the problem. The history is much too brief, and there is very little if any discussion of what distinguishes each glassmaker from its competitors. The pictures are great, but the book left me wanting more information, and I came away from it unsatisfied."
5,Natural Stomach Cure,"Since I have suffered from digestive problems for a full decade, I had more than a passing interest in this book. After reading it, I put into practice some of Dr. Minocha's teachings. I can testify beyond any doubt, his counsel works. In my opinion, it is, by far, the most pragmatic book written on the subject. I highly recommend it.John McCollister, Ph.D."
5,TSGW is a typical Saint story.,"The book contains three stories , all dealing with the Saint's adventures in the West.The best is the first one where the Saint stops a gang of Nazis from mining Uranium in a ranch.The other two stories will also appeal to any reader."
5,Metaphor for quebecois identity.,"Different from the traditional idea of the ""drag queen,"" Hosanna, an aging man confronts his demons, from socio-economic status, linguistic autonomy and masculinity. Hosanna speaks in Joual, the quebecois dialect and as she recounts her story she engages the reader's empathy. Michel Tremblay in an interview was clear that Hosanna represented the state of the quebecois when this piece was written (1971). Hosanna is wearing a mask of strength to hide her vulnerablities both in body and linguistic identity. Her Cleopatra suit and Drag Queen persona is her protection against anglo-culture. Tremblay is a prolific author and his characters vast. His work is akin to Balzac's ""Comedie Humaine."" For a good read, with universal appeal and a small history lesson. I would recommend any of Tremblay's work. No matter what walk of life, you will love Hosanna because one can easily identify with her very human crisis of existence."
2,over rated- low talent,"Seriously, this author has been given acclaim that is not deserving. I have now read two books by Tremblay and feel duped. The books are over written, melodramatic and fantasy. Not at all entertaining. Though, I do think he has possible potential as a playwright."
5,The best book so far in this series!,"I tried so many places to obtain this book which apparently was out of print, but finally was able to buy one through the mail. It was certainly worth waiting for! Lizzie has already lost one husband to an accident, and her second husband has suffered severe brain damage and now has the mind of a child. Yet, she feels eternally married, and dares not allow her feelings to go beyond friendship and neighborliness for Brad, the widower who is raising his girls alone. Yet, as smallpox spreads through their community, many key players die, and Lizzie is forced to depend on Brad to save her life and her family...and the ensuing developments sorely try her faith in God. Yet, being the strong prairie woman of faith that she is, she is able to regain her health and find happiness in a quite unique manner. I found this book to definitely be Feldhake's best of this series so far, and I am now reading book 5."
4,Like it very well,"We lucked onto this illustrated series of Little House books at the library -- I didn't even know they existed. This is a perfect way to bridge the gap for young readers who are past ""early reader"" books but not yet ready for a whole 14-chapter Little House book.The illustrations mimic (intentionally) the Garth Williams illustrations in my childhood Little House series, which are the ones I've saved for my kids."
5,Winter Days in the Big Woods,"Book was as described which was Brand New. It took a little long to get here but since I was in no hurryto get the book, it was Ok. Overall service - Excellent!!"
4,A Great Way to Pass on Little House to the Next Generation,"I purchased this book for my daughter (18 months) because I LOVE Little House on the Prairie. The books and television show were my absolute favorite growing up, and in fact, I still watch them to this day on DVD. The paperback format is actually better suited for girls slightly older than mine (she could easily bend the pages if I let her run off with the book), but she sits through the story beautifully when I read it to her and brings it to me to read to her again and again. I'm actually a little surprised because I found this particular book to be a little boring in it's composition. But hey, works for me! The illustrations are lovely. I definitely plan on buying more books in the ""My Little House"" series. If you want to pass Little House on to your girls, this is a great way to do it!"
4,Good movie!,"Penelope Ann Miller is not the greatest actress ever born, but this is a cute romantic comedy. I loved it in the 90's, so I bought it. The acting is dated, so it can seem a little corny at times, but it's still a cute movie!"
4,Needs a better quality transfer,Unfortunately it appears to be a copy of a VHS tape so the quality is not as good as a DVD but enjoyed the movie just the same.
2,Cute but Nothing Special,"This is a mediocre yet tolerable romantic comedy. It tries to be like Romancing the Stone but it falls short. The acting isn't too great, the characters cheesy and the plot silly but it's watchable.I'd never heard of this film in all these years and though it was decent to watch I can see why it never made a big impact.For a romance it was disappointing. The characters are thrown together and fall in love in a day. I guess it's supposed to be spontaneous but it just seemed ridiculous to me. The so-called villains act like they jumped out of a Pink Panther cartoon.This was definitely a mixed bag for me. It starts off intriguing but becomes less and less interesting as it goes on.I wouldn't have kept watching it if Tim Daly hadn't looked so hot in it. He looks good with a mustache!I wasn't too impressed by how the film looked. It hasn't held up well at all in 20 years. This was made in 1992 but the quality of the movie makes it seem like it was made in '72."
1,Can't play in the USA - Region 2,"BUYER BEWARE! This DVD is Region 2 and is not viewable on US DVD players. The seller will refuse to refund your purchase price if you have opened the case. The fact that it is REGION 2 is in the very small print under DVD format. Do not buy this DVD unless you have a player which can play region 2 discs. The movies is good fun, however. Hummie Mann's soundtrack is delightful."
1,Can't view in US,Buyer beware. This DVD is Region 2 and is not viewable on US DVD players. The seller refused to refund my purchase price. Do not buy this DVD unless you have a player which can play region 2 discs.
2,It was a very bad year...,"This movie is bad. Not VERY Bad, but bad enough. Penelope Miller has neither the sex appeal or charisma to be a heroine, and Tim Daly (with his moustache) comes across as a former porn star in his first ""legitimate"" role.I bought it because I collect wine and was very interested to see an adventure movie with a rare bottle of Lafite at its center. Sadly, the scenes of rare wine in musty cellars are few, and I hated to see the Impériale of Lafite treated so badly.If you want to buy it because you're interested in wine, don't. There's not enough of it. If you're interested because it's an action/adventure move, don't. It has little of either."
4,Cute romantic comedy with Louis Jordan,Tim Daly sports a very Magnum PI mustache and Penelope Ann Miller is an adorable frumpy ragamuffin in this romantic comedy adventure tale. I love Louis Jordan as the youth obsessed scientist determined to get his youth formula at any cost. Has some elements found in the Cary Grant Ginger Rogers classic Moneky Business- this is one of my personal favorite comedies from the 90s. Seldom seen on TV and hard to find on VHS I bought a copy several years back- this is one I want to upgrade to DVD- come on studio!
4,The best romantic movie without overt sexual scenes.,This is the first entertaining movie i've seen in a long time. Penelope & Tim are both funny and appealing I would like to see more of these types of films. I love intriguing chase movies.
4,An Overlooked Gem,This movie has gotten some unnecessarily bad press. It's basically a Cinderella story with wine. The performances are excellent and the Louis Jourdan subplot is clever. This is a straightforward romantic comedy with some international adventure elements. The script is by the great William Goldman. I've seen it again and again. It's sweet and endearing and the wine information is accurate. Check it out. You have nothing to lose and you probably have a wine-loving friend or two who will find it fun.
1,DISAPPOINTED,"I bought it as a gift for my daughter's 1st birthday. The drum doesnt work, POOR SOUNDS! My daughter is ignoring it. i was deceived by the approaching details of this product.Waste of money!"
3,It's fun,"I bought this to entertain my son during a long car ride and he had no interest in it, but once we got home he had fun with it. He likes how the different buttons do different things."
4,Beautiful animal illustrations,"My 22-month old loves any book that includes animal illustrations and this is a recent favorite. His favorite part is the last page which introduces all the animal babies that were pictured throughout the book. He likes to repeat each name as we say them. However, he does seem to be disturbed by the picture of the mother lion carrying her cub in her mouth. He always wants to look at that picture the longest and he keeps saying ""Bite"" over and over. We've tried to explain that this doesn't hurt the baby, but it still bothers him. There is also a picture of a mother crocodile carrying her baby in her mouth, but for some reason, this doesn't bother him. Otherwise, we really enjoy this book."
5,Really good product!,"It's a really good product with many accesories, nice display, nice features, never failed to work properly, it feels good in your hand, relatively easy menu :) I loved it...I changed it for a creative zen v plus that is on his way...I hope it will work just as good as this one did :) Oh I forgot...it is really worth the money!!! really good price!!!"
5,Excellent,A great Bible for children. This seller was prompt and the book arrived in great condition.Awesome book!
1,Worse than worthless,"Raising children to follow one's religion is the surest way to insure new recruits to whatever Christian cult the parents subscribe to. Teaching a child to believe in supernatural nonsense is simply child abuse. In the United States, this abuse occurs on a grand scale."
4,Great for beginning readers of the Bible,"We appreciated the simplicity of the translation. It is great for beginning readers of the Bible. I wish it had more illustrations, maps, notes for kids. So we are actually using a different one to read with our children."
2,Print too small,Just received this Bible and the font is too small. Everything else is good but the print s too small for my wife to read. I wonder if there is one available with larger font? She had an earlier one that is worn out and the font in it was good.
5,Easiest English Translation!,This Bible works. It's not a dumbed-down or inaccurate paraphrase but a full translation. Missionaries are using this version as the basis for Bible study materials because it's accurate and simple. Try it with confidence.
4,International Children's Version of the Bible,"I purchased this book for my neices but found myself using it for my own personal Bible study on David. The stories flow like a story book rather than ""scripture"". The simplicity of the translation bring to life the characters and places. Although, I know how the stories end, I still find myself wanting to know more. It has been written on a third-grade level but can be used by all ages. This translation has inspired me to study more for which I am greatly thankful."
5,Papa San - The Sistem ***** Stars!,Papa San is dancehall reggae's greatest ambassador. Unique styles and bass that will knock you out of your seat and get you moving. He's the life of the party with clean lyrics that anyone can enjoy. He's a christian Jamaican that spreads the Word. I highly recommend Papa San's The Sistem (System in US) for anyone who like reggae/dancehall/soca/world music.
1,Not Christian,I didn't know that Papa San use to make secular music. I bought this not knowing. He started later so if u want christian reggae don't buy this. I don't know how good this CD is bcuz I stopped it when I realized it wasn't christian.
1,Not near as good as the older versions,"I owned a couple older versions of this program. I bought this becuase my older software wasn't compatible with my new XP operating system. I was very disappointed when I found Microsoft has dropped many of the functions such as artistic edges and text enhancements such as shadows. I loved these features and found they recommended an ""upgrade"" to the Digital Image Suite. I thoguht I would do this, but I found you can't ""upgrade."" You have to buy the full version of Digital Image Suite for the full price. Ridiculus! I went ahead and purchased Adobe Photoshop Elements. I recommend you do too."
4,Used to be better,"I used to have an older version of Picture It! and it had slightly different settings. I miss being able to change the focus of the photo and see the result on the screen. It is important for some photos to be more focused and others to be softened. There is an option to change the focus but not until you get to the printing stage and then you can't see what it will look like. Another idea would be to change the icons back to their familiar shapes with the apple for tint, the eye for brightness and focus, etc. Overall a good product but I look foward to seeing improvements."
1,"This what had been ""Picture it 99""","Microsoft had a great interface with Picture it 99. It was intuitive and projects could happen quickly. Digital Image pro 9 (Which I upgraded to) removed some of the key features of the former software. Some of the most powerful features, being the ability to stretch text and make size adjustments in real time were taken away. Insane. Now all I want to do is go back to the former system. I tried to install MS Picture it 99 only to find that it wouldn't install with all the XP updates etc. This is what I find discouraging about Microsoft products, just when you get used to a piece of software's interface, they change everything and remove other key features. Pure stupidity in my opinion."
3,"A clever, but forgettable work of gay erotica","The plot in Revolt of the Naked is not very complicated. The title pretty much spells it out. It is a clever story, though, and one of the hottest examples of gay erotica you'll find in the sci-fi genre."
4,Imagination,"Imaginative and sexy, the description of the characters have something for everybody's taste. The peculiar world in this adventure makes you wish some cinematographer could put it on film."
1,This is a fake show in a barn somewhere.,"After seeing the cool Key West stuff out there, this disappoints. Someone hired a bunch of strippers to dance in a barn. Not fun. Not interesting."
3,"Visually pleasing, but plan on figuring a lot out on your own","I was very excited when I found this book, as there are not too many resources for felted crochet out there. The projects are innovative, attractive, and contemporary. However, as soon as I started making the projects I discovered many problems with the book. There are significant errors and ommissions in many of the patterns, which resulted in my spending a lot of time and frustration re-calculating and deciphering how to complete the projects. The author does not use what is considered fairly standard crochet notation, and the book lacks the short, helpful directives, such as ""to make the heel of slipper:"" or ""to make the strap:"" found in most crochet instructions. Also, be ready for LOTS of double-crochet. Overall, I'd say this book has great ideas, but falls very short on project instructions."
2,"Pretty pictures, poor instructions","Was excited over this book, pictures are pretty, but the instructions are not clear, many are not numerically accurate and I have yet, using 100% wool and following her technique, had anything successfully felt for me. Author would do well to have a web site and post an errata file for this book. Please feel free to email me if she does; have not found one as of this writing. Would not buy another book from this author."
3,Nice projects...iffy instructions,"I was very happy to see a felting book for crochet with patterns that I'd actually make. I've made several already with great success especially the flowers to embellish, beaded eyeglass case, coin purse, and the pincushion and did notice a few little errors in the other instructions but as a seasoned crocheter I was able to figure my way through with little difficulty until I tried the ""Scissors Case"" on pg. 91. Rnd 1 of the finishing section is badly written and simply will not work out. I've been reworking this round as long as it took to make the entire case! I've looked at the Krause publications website for an errata page but none was found. I've emailed them and await their reply."
1,fuzzy striped blanket,"I am trying to make this blanket and the directions are very unclear. It would be nice if the author could be contacted for some guidance. Also, if anyone knows how to follow the directions for this blanket, I would truly appreciate the assistance. I have already purchased the wool and would love to complete what I have started!"
1,Not the MEDIUM Quad,"The item description for this plate says ""Medium Quad"" --- it is actually the MINI quad!"
5,"Excellent, lively Weber Overtures","I bought this used on a whim at a local record store, and it quickly became a favorite classical CD.This collection of Weber Overtures and other music by Roy Goodman and his Hanover Band are lively, musical, and exciting. The three most famous ones, ""Oberon"", ""Euryanthe"" and ""Der Frieschutz"" all come off better than most, with incisive playing and great transparency, and the others are revelations. ""Invitation to the Dance"" is wonderful. The timbre of the period instruments is different than modern instruments, with plangency and tartness that fit the brighter musical passages very well. At the used prices as low as $2, I'd jump at the chance."
5,dance your a** off!,What a moving spinner and jules is quite a lass. I could go shogging with her on the streets of London all night long. Well there you go.
3,1 sided easel???,"Well, I read some of the other reviews about the chalkboard side of this easel and I should have listened. The dry erase and paint side are AWESOME. I set up the paints/markers in the morning and my daughter enjoys it all day long. As for the chalkboard side, I did what the directions said and more. I used several pieces of chalk and rubbed them horizontially and vertically all over the board, then erased it with a paper towel. I repeated this process 3 times and it's still difficult to write on the board. The board does not grab the chalk. I even used 2 different brands of chalk. I'm thinking about painting it with black chalkboard paint to see if that will work."
1,Not what it says,"I bought this Easel because it says ""loaded w/ accessories"" in the description. It was suppose to come w/ paint cups, paint, chalk, crayons, brushes & a drop cloth & it came with none of the above. I received it the day before my Son's birthday thinking it came with these things because it said it did & he couldn't play with it because it did not. Before you order this realize it's just the easel. I contacted Amazon but they said I had to contact the seller. So I did contact Roundtable & they said Amazon has the description wrong. They were suppose to call me back in regards to me getting the accessories......well still waiting for that phone call."
5,Great Easel! Lots of Options!,"We got this for our toddlers for Christmas and they love it. It's loads of fun and has everything I was looking for in an easel for them. A chalk board, a dry erase board that is also magnetic (most of the other easels on the market are not), adjustable height, big trays for art supplies, a paper roll in between the two sides (less enticing for toddlers to unroll all of the paper) and a cutter that is also nicely placed/ hidden. The only drawback was the directions for assembling - they were not very helpful and did not even picture or explain the bar that hides and covers the cutter."
1,Frustrate,"I bought the CD The Leaving Time of the Michael Shrieve and Steve Roach, but to open de box, to my surprise received the CD Stilletto of the Michael Shrieve (the box is of the CD The Leaving Time).I was very frustate with the Newburycomics."
3,Gun Dogs is OK,"The book was well written, but just did not meet my expectations. Wiht a new Brittany, and no experience training a gun dog, I was looking for more nuts and bolts. I was halfway through the book before we got to training. It was all about breeds, picking a puppy and a name, and selecting a collar and leash.The whistle and hand signals section is helpful. The forced fetching instruction is good, and the training with pigeons is informative.I only wish there was more step-by-step training guidelines ""for dummies."""
3,MLS UNIX,"This is in reality about MLS UNIX, not ""standard"" UNIX. MLS UNIX is, to my knowledge, not sold anymore. It gives an overview of the concepts of B-level (Orange Book) systems and in particular, how it was implemented in MLS UNIX. It is in no way a technical book, more of a book made out of a course (including slides).It can still be read, but you need to understand some of the concepts beforehand."
2,Deeply biased,"The scholarship here is certainly broad, but that is almost entirely overshadowed by the author's anti-religion biases."
4,FANTASTIC SHOW/ ALL JOURNEY FANS MUST OWN,"Journey and me go waaaay back. I have loved them from the beginning and followed their career. I regret I haven't seen them live so this was a dream come true for me. I must admit from the get go that I am partial to Steve Perry (I think most of us are, right?) and I do so wish he were singing. However, his replacement, Steve Augeri, does a good job especially on the faster songs. This is a must own for all Journey fans because Neal Schon, Ross Vallory and Johnathan Cain show that time under a true artists belt, only makes them BETTER. Great sound, wonderful enthusiasm, fantastic entertaining show to watch and enjoy many times.Soar,Soaring Heart"
4,Terrific concert footage but no bonus features,"The concert itself is outstanding and I love the sound quality. But there were no bonus features, no interviews, no videos, no nothing, so therefore it gets 4 stars instead of 5."
5,Awsome Video,"I have always been a very big Journey fan. However I did not realize there was a Journey before Steve Perry. To me SP will always be the ""voice"" of Journey. I lost touch of them in later years and didn't even realize that they had had other lead singers since him. Since rediscovering them lately I have watched many a youtube video checking out the various lead singers. I must admit, I really really like Steve Augeri and wish he would have been able to stick with them. I have only had this DVD a few days and have watched it over and over and for a 54 year old woman that is saying something. I absolutely love it. Augeri just fits the personna I think for this group. To bad he is no longer with them. Buy this and enjoy, enjoy."
1,Augeri-fronted Journey a pathetic shell of the real thing,"I wish I could give it NO stars.They've become a joke, a tribute band - a second rate one at that!What were they thinking - you don't dump the guy who brought you to the big time and replace him with a wanna-be.Awful, absolute abysmal! Jon Cain and Neal Schon should be ashamed of themselves."
3,Vocals are different,"Steve Augeri cannot (or chooses not to) hold the notes for as long as steve perry can, and that is a major part (trademark) of journey's sound. The rest of this DVD is pure journey."
1,nice try but no dice,"NO STEVE PERRY .... NO JOURNEY !!!!!!! JOUENEY WOULD HAVE BEEN NOTHING AFTER GREG ROLIE LEFT IF MR. PERRY HAD NOT COME ALONG ... SO NOW THAT MR. PERRY IS NO LONGER THERE , THERE IS NO JOURNEY AS FROM AS I AM CONCERNED... GO OUT A BUY ALL OF STEVE PERRYS SOLO ALBUMS IF U WANT TO HEAR SOME AWSOME VOCALS .!!!!!!!"
1,The journey is Over,"No Steve Perry, No Journey. Steve Perry was more than just a voice. You can't bring in someone with the same first name and who can imitate a good Perry, and expect it to be the same.Original Journey Fan............"
1,Journey to hell,Journey- Steve Perry= a joke. Somebody should sue for false advertising. I'm a huge Journey fan and would not go see this Journey cover band if they were playing in my basement. Shame on all of these greedy people who used to play in Journey.
1,all the joy of a canadian quarter.,"Journey post-Steve Perry is Journey Lite. The new songs are simplistic, over produced and are filled with meaningless lyrics. This disc is a reflection of that. If you like to go to see tribute bands, and free vegas lounge acts, this disk is for you. Shame on the guys in this band, and shame on me for being fool enough to buy this dvd. Better to have memories of the real thing, than to have polluted my brain with Journey-Lite. If you saw the band in the 80s, if you understand the songwriting contribution that Steve Perry brought, move on."
2,2nd Rate Perry Clone Takes Away the Power of This Band,"I have been following Journey since their inception as a prog-rock/Jazz fusion band in the early 70s, through their rise to superstardom in the 80s. I was very excited, then ultimately let down by their recent ""comeback"". The new singer Steve Augeri is a 2nd rate Steve Perry clone. In an effort to cash in on past glories, Journey has taken the easy path by recruiting an almost exact replica to replace Perry. Had they found a new singer with a distinctive voice to expore new territory, this might have been a more interesting reincarnation of a once great band. Augeri's limitations become startlingly clear with the blatant use of prerecorded vocals used to augment his limited ability to mimic Perry's sound. The musical performances are lackluster and the true genius of this band, Neal Schon, is never given an opportunity to shine that he deserves. Very dissapointing to this fan of 25+ years."
1,DO Stop Believin,"Any form of journey WITHOUT Steve Perry is NOT Journey. It's like Van Hagar or Styx without Dennis DeYoung.This is a tribute cover band, NOT the real deal."
5,Journey LIVES!!!!,"This DVD is what got me back into Journey, after years of having lost touch with my favorite band of all time. I have seen it literally hundreds of times, and it never ever gets old. If you have not seen JOURNEY with Steve Augeri as the lead vocalist, then you have not seen JOURNEY! The band goes on today, rocking better than ever. Thanks to Neal, Ross, Jon, Deen and Steve A. WE LOVE YOU GUYS! Melanie"
3,Journey 2001 DVD,"As with a few American DVD's I've purchased over the internet from the states, I found that the centre speaker sound is all but missing and from this point of view it sounds as though they are singing down a tunnel. Could this be the engineers fault ???I have others, Eagles, Meatloaf, these are perfect with an excellent centre speaker channel. What on earth is going on. The Journey 2001 DVD is excellent other than for the sound.Is anyone out there experiencing the same problem, please get in touch!!"
5,Perfeccion Total,"Realmente perfecta la elaboracion de este DVD, la calidad de sonido y la imagen son extraordinarios, la interpretacion de las canciones son excelentes. Sabia lo buen gitarrista que es Neal Schon pero despues de verlo aqui quede mas impresionado de lo que pensaba, el nuevo baterista es super energico, pero lo mas impresionante de este DVD es el vocalista Steve Augeri, el es el perfecto clon vocal de Perry, si estan dudando adquirir este DVD solamente porque no esta Perry, estan equivocados, Augeri es el hombre perfecto para el grupo. Una muy buena adquisicion."
5,This DVD is awesome!,"Wonderful DVD of Journey how they are now, new band members,new music. They still rock! This DVD has a bit of everythingfor the die hard Journey fan yet is a wonderful find for atrue music lover. Steve A. and Deen C. are amazing performers.You have to watch and hear HIGHER PLACE, this song ROCKS! ENJOY!"
5,Awesome DVD for Journey,"I've owned this DVD for a while now and yes, I'm a Journey fan from the beginning. Steve Augeri, front man, is awesome..he has the voice of an angel and captures the audience in the palm of his hand and has made the classics new again.Neal Schon's guitar riffs are like no other, no wonder he's known as The Rock God.If you haven't already done so, go buy this DVD..you will not be disappoined!"
5,excellent DVD,"probably alot of you know that there are some that say journey is not journey without steve perry. i am not one of them! the new steve, augeri, does an amazing job on lead vocals. but i was even more impressed with steve smith's replacement! deen castronovo is not only a master of the skins, this guy SINGS while he's all over the drum set---ditto on amazing. a great DVD and worth your cash."
3,movie purchase,"had to buy this so I could critique the ""new Steve"" there will never by another Steve Perry no matter how many times they try."
5,The best Journey concert yet,"This DVD is amazing to say the least. In fact, being a young fan who has not been exposed to older bands, it was watching part of this concert that got me hooked in the first place. With a few fresh cuts from their new album Arrival tossed in with some of the classics like ""Faithfully"" and ""Don't Stop Believin'"", there's no way this DVD can be anything less than awesome. Proof that great music never goes out of style!"
2,"A good Journey ""Tribute Band"" Featuring ""Bizaro"" Steve","Bizaro Steve sounds alot like Perry at times,so he manages to do a good job on the classic Journey tunes.I'm afraid however that this band comes off more as a Journey ""tribute band"" rather then the genuine article.The Journey ""live in Houston"" dvd is much better,a classic concert from 1981,with the Real Steve..."
3,Enjoyable little murder mystery,"Downloaded this book on my first visit to Hawaii - Maui. I was on an 8th floor balcony looking over Moloka'i and really enjoyed seeing it as I read! It was a fun quick read and the author kept the action going and the pages turning!Made a nice vacation ""get away"" even better!"
3,Not impressed,"I purchased this book and the 2nd book MORE ACTIVITIES THAT TEACH. I felt the first one was lacking significantly. The population I work with are intercity youth ages 16-24. My program is an educational alternative program and my youth come in anywhere from a 6th grade learning level up. Out of the entire book I found THREE activities I though I could actually use for them. Several of the activities seemed incredibly difficult for my students to comprehend. I feel very few of these activities would be appropriate for any student below 11th grade. Also-most activities required materials with them. I am fine with that, except some where extensive and again-I felt would be confusing for the population I serve. This may be beneficial for a traditional high school atmosphere, maybe a youth group, but other wise I would not recommend. However the second book was much better."
4,Excellent Activities for Students with Behavior Problems,"I teach a in high school special education behavior program. This book was recommended to me by a colleague who teaches a different behavior program. He has all of the books in the series and speaks very highly of the activities. I've been extremely happy with the outcome of the activities I've tried. My students have actually engaged in the discussions and enjoyed the activities themselves. I like that each activity has the kids moving, drawing, talking to each other, etc. I'm looking forward to running more activities this year."
5,Great group training,"This book provides me with many leadership building activities to use in my classes at school. The various activities teach communication skills and goal setting,along with games that encourage making good and healthy choices. Marvelous resource for sponsors and teachers who emphasize being good role models!"
3,Collabs tape is really cool.,"Kool Keith is certainly better than most of the junk you see today, this album has good cameos from chino xl and many others, this is one decent album, when I Think about making good albums, I Made them with style, truth, honesty and self hope, there is hope for hip-hop coming soon, once this pop rap comes to an end and real hip-hop will return to the yellow brick road, and this album will defintely prove.I'm giving this album a Thumbs Up."
5,Examines the nature and applications of air power,"Walter Boyne's The Influence Of Air Power Upon History is an informed and informative history which examines the nature and applications of air power from the early days of the balloon to current space warfare and jets. Air power exercised in both war and peace times survey the contributions made by people and technology of each era, drawing some important links between individual achievement and usage."
2,Loosely Written,"""It was with no little trepidation..."" So begins the first sentence of the introduction. Whether the content of this book improves on its loose and ambiguous prose is beyond me. Excerpts from the middle of the book were also similarly written. If you are able to overlook this writing style you might find some gems worth your time."
5,"The Ghost (Apparition) of Metal Past, Present & Future","Another fantastic cd from these German Metallers. Classic metal, just great. Keep on rocking over there guys!!!!"
2,There is little action and much philosophizing.,"We read that theirs is a perfect society but there are no particulars about health,, education, child-rearing, or politics. The author seems to be saying that only without men or sex can we achieve a Utopian culture. It was much more a treatise on feminism than a novel with 3-dimensional characters and an interesting story line."
3,A dissappointment,"Although this CD has plenty of tracks on it, there aren't many good ones. These guys were pretty hard hitting, and awesome, on their first cd, especially if you have the original version of cd with 3 more songs on it, now missing due to a lawsuit, as some of my friends call it, gangster swing music. But this new cd they've released is a little more mellow and in my opinion doesn't live up to the gangster swing style they used to have. They've lost a few band members since the first CD, namely Johnny Paisani Ferrara whose great vocals are missing on this cd. 3 out of 5 stars sums it up as average, you may or may not like it if you're heard their first cd."
3,Boardwalk Boogie!,"Very entertaining Swing band. Funny lyrics and powerful music. ""Broccili"" Rob Cittadino is singing with an italian accent. Few songs are not that good. I don't like ""Detroit Rock City"" and ""Loose Cannon""."
3,Jokes for granddaughter,"I e-mail my [...] granddaughter jokes often, the cornier, the better. She loves corny humor. I thought I would have a never-ending supply with this big book of jokes, but I have to hunt to find short, simple jokes for her. I would say that the book is for an older audience than first graders. It has a lot of good material in general, but too many long jokes in my opinion."
2,"Hey, kids like it","This book has some (okay, maybe even a lot of) un-funny jokes that don't make much sense (non-sequitar), but it has some good ones and my younger siblings enjoy reading it."
5,One of his best...,I saw Luka Bloom last night in Seattle and bought the CD at the show. The show was fantastic and the CD hasn't stopped playing since. One of the best singer-songwriters of our day. Beautiful guitar and melodies.
3,A Decent Effort,"After ten albums, you would expect Luka Bloom to be a proficient crafter of Irish-influenced folk. And ""Innocence"" is a well-crafted album: it's got flowing melodic lines, well written lyrics, and a soft, whispered vocal delivery that's perfect for the material. However, the songs (and instrumentation) just aren't distinctive enough to rise above mood music. This isn't to say that ""Innocence"" is totally generic- the flamenco guitar and jazz saxophone lines in some of the songs are creative and haunting. But the punch and spirit that Luka Bloom has shown he's capable of just aren't there."
2,Great Laptop- Major Problems,"This is a great laptop. I enjoyed it so much with the wide keyboard and comfortable size screen. It has the power to run robust programs and write applications. It comes with CDW and DVD which both come very handy.The down side it diedon me 3 month in use. I sent it to service probably 4 times to HP service. Hasn't been fixed yet. So on the reliablity scale, it disappointing."
2,didn't work for my SUV,Didn't work on my seats. But I still used it to store some things and rolled it up.
2,Poor print quality,"Book arrived in a timely fashion, however, 90% of the book has the pages printed on an angle. It appears none of the data was cut off, but it does make reading akward."
4,sturdy companion,"I've had this watch for several years. For simple walking it works well, the watch screen is easy to see, and it's easy to set. My only complaint is when the battery wears down..about once a year, the replacement has to be done by a watchmaker as I haven't a clue. It's not just ""drop in"" another battery."
4,Excellent translation with one major disappointment.,"I think the translators did an excellent job with their technique of optimal equivalence. My only disappointment was the changing of weights to modern equivalents. I do not see the necessity of this. I think that there is some signifigance with the original numbers, but of course that gets lost with conversion. I think that it would have been best to give the original weight in the text and footnote a modern equivalent."
4,"Good Translation, but different","It's what Iwanted and expected. in great condition. the translation approach is unique to me, and I have found it to be very useful and sometimes very enlightening"
5,Great Bible,I bought this bible after googling to see what was an easy bible to understand. This bible received many good reviews. I'm glad I purchased.
3,As expected,"OK, let's talk clear: the music on this cd is good. It's also very much like any of his previous music, specially the score for the 'Double life of Veronique', delicate sometimes, intense at others, over a calm baseline. Thus, if you've heard him before, this is yet another example. Nothing different, and he delivers as expected.I can see some people won't like it. And this is probably not him at his best. But some parts are really good. Some are not. The average is fairly good. I guess I was expecting something new compared to his previous compositions."
5,Painfully beautiful,"The music I love is the music that makes you FEEL SOMETHING. Rarely does that happen these days. However, the music on this CD breaks your heart several times as you listen to it. It's beautiful and bittersweet. I highly recommend it. Even for those who don't normally enjoy classical music, this is a good introduction."
2,"Too expensive, not effective","It sounds nice to pay... for an item that could save hundreds in replacement costs. One problem, it does not really work that well and it is a pain to use.It will clean. It might fix some scratches, but clearly not all of them.Also, you hand will get tired while using it because the mechanism runs slooooowly."
2,just ok,"Let me start by saying that i had hiley recommended it for my work to use so we could save many cds.That didn't happen. It is very slow,hand starts to hurt after awhile and u cant find the replacements when the peaces run down. very unhappy with this product.Also very dissapointed with the company."
4,A must for Martial Arts enthusiasts,"Though the movie is a patch-job of an earlier TV series, it's hugely enjoyable. I gave it 4 stars for two reasons :1. The cut-n-paste job doesn't have the sheen of a regular production film and at a couple of points in the movie one can tell that there must have been something else to follow but has been cut.and more importantly,2. Some of the brilliant fight scenes have been cut. I know this because I have watched the fight sequences on you-tube and when I was expecting a certain move, I saw something else. MOVES WERE CUT. :-(That said, for all you martial arts film buffs, I would slot this one in the same category as Master Killer (aka The 36th Chamber of Shaolin). So it's a must see movie ..... I'd even go so far as to say that it's a must have movie.Enjoy !!"
5,The Tai Chi Master,"From the legendary action director of THE MATRIX trilogy, KILL BILL 1 and 2, and CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON, Yuen Wo Ping, comes this epic kung fu adventure starring Jacky Wu (TAI CHI FIST, THE LEGEND OF ZU)! Wu is Yang, am ambitious martial artist who leaves home to learn Tai Chi. But Chan, the Tai Chi master, refuses to teach Yang because he is not a member of the Chan's family. With the help of Chan's dauighter, however, Yang was able to learn to learn Chan's Tai Chi secretly. When Chan is kidnapped by the ruthless Lord Tun (Billy Chow from Jet Li's FIST OF LEGEND), Yang must use his newly learned Tai Chi kung fu to defeat his formidable opponent, but not before he fights Lord Tun's seven kung fu masters first."
5,Coolest movie,I loved this movie and believe it had one of the best action. Really fast. Jet li is awesome. Like most Hong Kong martial art movies it has comedy and action together. I don't recall any moment where I was bored in this movie. Fantastic movie.
3,good for the price,holds my Hi-point 9mm compact well you have to sew the straps once you get it adjusted so they stay in place you get what you pay for but it does ok
2,holster,"The holster it self is nice. it took bit to make it fit but, it smells so bad. as if it came across the ocean in a wet cargo box. I have tried putting in a bag with bakeing soda - fresh sent ect. If they can't see the gun under my coat they could sure smell it coming."
1,Unscrupulous seller,"Despite the universal, one-size-fits-all, application chart, this holster did not come close to fitting my gun. It seems the holster was sewn too far into the open end so only my muzzle could be inserted. I followed all of their instructions and sent the new, unused, apparently defective holster back and received only half of my money back. I will never purchase from this seller again and I advise others against it, as well."
4,A Real Conundrum,"It's a nice thing to have... for a costume. Luckily, that's why I purchased the holster. However, for any realy practical purposes, well, you get what you pay for. And I have to note that this holster needs a guide in itself on how to just put it on. I know I had to glance at the product picture online here more than once."
3,I must be stupid...,I could never get these darn things on correctly and when I did think I got it on correctly I put in an airsoft gun it fell out and broke when i stood up (I did fail to clasp the buckle however). Shoulder holsters look really cool but I just can't seem to set this one up correctly so its comfortable but also useful. Very disappointed.
4,A Little Tricky,"I admit, it's a little tricky to figure out at first, but if my 55 year old mother can figure it out, then I'm sure someone who's been on the police force for 30 years should be able to, also. For anyone thinking of buying this, the long velcro straps hanging down are for your belt. After you figure that out, you should have no problems. I wish it would fit a little more snug, but maybe I have some more adjusting to do. Over all, it comes in real handy."
4,Strident Style,"John Wallace demonstrates considerable zeal in the performance of these pieces from his homeland. His style is really vastly different from any other trumpeter's I've heard; his tonguing is often explosive, and his vibrato (he uses it rarely) is slow and long. His volume is powerful. While I think his playing is ill-suited the the Italian baroque, he does capture the imperialist grandeur of the Empire in his playing. The highlight of the album is Arne's Rule Britannia. Edmund Barham's strong tenor is a good match for Wallace, and they cut throught the at-times cumbersome chorus."
2,Ok... nothing special,"This book needs color pictures. The whole premise is to help pilots learn how to decipher sat. and radar images, but you can't tell much about the example pictures due to their quality and their lack of color. However, pilots really need to know this stuff, so something is better than nothing. Buy the used version - not worth ""full price."""
1,"DON'T BUY, MISLEADING FOR FANS!!!",Riker and LaForge never went anywhere near the USS Excelsior!!! Riker and LaForge are from the 24th century while the USS Excelsior was in the 23rd century. Scotty and Sulu were the only Starfleet officers that served on any of the USS Enterprises to have been aboard the USS Excelsior!!! DO NOT BUY!!! IT'S BOGUS!!!!
3,So far not quite what I expected.,"I have been taking these capsules for just over a week. I take about 2 Elderberry capsules a day but so far I don't see any real changes. I was already eating fresh fruits, veggies and drinking cranberry juices, which was helping to boost my immune system. Perhaps if I give it a month or so I will notice some changes as far as the infections that I may have, etc. As far as UTIs, I just drink my cranberry juice and I notice changes immediately."
2,Hack writing at its worst.,"Characters were cliched, cardboard and lifeless. I couldn't have care less if they lived or died. Dialog was awkward and inane. There were holes in the plot you could drive a Mack truck through. A net hacker kid finds out about an attempt on the head of a Megacorporation, but the company with more money and resources then God walks blindly into it? Oh, Please!! And sentence structure was terrible: ""They all switched on their helmet lamps, throwing angled beams jerkily in every direction at the stained, filthy of the walls of the tunnels by the motion of climbing down the ladder."" - if I was the publisher, I'd be looking to fire the editor who allowed this sentence to go into print. Amazingly, scenes with the Dark Legion were smooth, almost as if they were written by someone else. Plus, Micheal Stackpole, one of my favorite authors, wrote the last book of this trilogy, so I trudged my way through this book just to get a feeling of completion."
2,Didn't like it.,"I read the book because I was interested in the game, Mutant Chronicles and Warzone, and that the third book in the series was written by Micheal Stackpole.Reading it I though it was one of the dullest and dumbest books I had ever read. The second book was better but not all that great either.The only reason I continued to read these books was because the third was written by Stackpole. By the time I got there I was satisfied."
3,Good starter guitar,"I bought one of these about 6 months ago for my son. It is his first guitar. First thing, this thing is heavy! It's a nice looking guitar with good finish. It has decent pickups with good sound and high output. Now for the problems that I've seen. Main one being lot's of broken strings, especially 4,5,and 6. First I thought it was how he was playing it but it turned out to be sharp edges on the tremelo block and the string saddles. I tryed using a dremel to round off edges but finally gave up and put a Wilkinson unit on it which solved about 90% of the problems. The other 10% can be blamed on the aggresive playing style of my future rock star! The fret edges are a bit rough too. I guess all in all, it's a good guitar for the price."
3,"Unless you are a HUGE fan of Incubus, bypass this DVD.","I bought this DVD and really enjoyed the videos and some of the concert footage. There is even a hilarious clip from ""Mad TV.""But some of the ""extras"" are done with a home video recorder and is often out of focus, not to mention pointed at the floor.Also neither version of ""Wish You Were Here"" is contained on this DVD. The only place I have seen the orginal video is on Much Music.Unless you are a HUGE fan of Incubus this DVD may not be for you."
4,great for any kind of incubus fan,"wether you've been a fan from the fungus amongus days, science days, or make yourself, this dvd is for you. it contains live perfomances of all the best songs from science and make yourself. it also has all there music videos, including videos which i believe have never been on mtv, a certian shade of green, and take me to your leader, but yea it has there big mtv hit videos too. its got lots of great stuff though, a must buy for any incubus fan, and its pretty affordable too."
5,Magnum Gatorline,"Great stuff. Strong and wears really well, even when trimming among rocks lining a drainage ditch."
4,AN OVERALL GREAT COMPILATION BY A PREMIER ARTIST,"THIS HAS GOTTA BE THE BEST COMPILATION OF THE CALIFORNIA RAPPERS IVER EVER HEARD. I GIVE MUCH RESPECT AND PROPS TO MAC MALL AND THE REST OF THE ""WEST COAST"" ARTISTS. IT'S A GREAT BUY, SO I DEFINETLY RECOMMEND IT. GO OUT AND GET THIS ONE WHILE IT'S HOT!!!"
4,another compalation hit you beeaaaah.....TCH!!!,"This compilation is pretty tight most of da tracks be bumpin but I wouldnt call it the best compilation out there.SAN QUINN & MESSY came tight as always but I think they could of came tighter if they had gone wid a straight mobb track instead of some mellowed out beat... Its been awhile since Ive heard MAC MALL,but he doesnt disapiont anyone...cuz the first track is some of dat mobb sh!t dat yall like!!!right?!!! most of the cd is bumpin so its worth buying check it out!!!"
5,Great Spiritual Focus,"This book is more about spirituality than magick, IMHO, which makes it different and enriching. It's a meaty book that starts out gently and packs a wollop, building on each step in a sacred pattern - a wheel that looks at common archetypes and how they apply to our faith and our daily living. Highly recommended; perhaps her best book yet."
3,of silver lining,"When Delight Tremaine joined her brother in an Alaskan air base, she was warned that the young officers there were starving for the company of an attractive girl. She promised to just be ""Best Friends with all of them"". But she did not reckon meeting Lt. Bill Mason, so handsome and yet so maddeningly aloof. Neither did she expect to meet Captain Steele, who was hard as his name.Delight suspected that the hatred between these two West Pointers was deep. Was it a girl? Was it a passed up promotion?Behind the Cloud is a wholesome and clean romance novel - typical of an Emilie Loring creation."
5,Rights and Wrongs,"I was aware of the many moral positions taken by John Paul II on different issues. But this book explains the philosophical and theological background to the positions. The chapters on conscience, law, and freedom are especially good. Very careful scholarship."
3,Landscaping bricks,"These bricks look very nice once installed. Many of the bricks were hard to snap together. The kit only comes with 4 lighted bricks, so the picture is deceiving. You can buy individual lighted brick on the manufacturers' website, but they are $12.95/each. So it would cost quite a bit to get the look shown in the pictures."
2,Poor solar lights,I felt the bricks looked nice along my driveway until I found out I had a bad solar light.I e-mailed the manufacture to get a replacement.They e-mailed me back with a request for my PO number that I mailed to them that day.It has been three weeks with no relpy and no replacement solar light.I was going to place another order but with the poor service I changed my mind.
3,I was dissappointed,because I thought there were more bricks with lights in them. But I like how they look.I will be putting them in my yard when the weather gets better.
2,Only 4 solar lights per box,"In Amazon web site there is no description on how many solar ligths you get in the 20 feet box, I was surprised to see only 4 solar lights plastic bricks in 20 feet of plastic bricks.I think the description of the product is misleading, be aware before you think about buying this product.The picture portraits several solar lights total of eight but you get only four."
5,3d Edition Great Learning Tool for New ver6&7 Features,"The first two editions of this book covered Mathematica versions up to version 5. Mathematica's latest versions 6&7 are greatly different from those previous Mathematica versions, epecially in the areas of graphics and animations.This third edition covers all the applicable material from those first two editions plus it a great primer for all those new features in Mathematica ver6&7. The examples are very clear and understandable.So even if you're already familiar with ver 5., this book will help you quickly grasp and use those new ver6&7 features.As did the first two editions, this third edition comes with a CD that contains the entire book in Mathematica notebook form. It comes with instructions that tell you how to easily make the book accessible from Mathematica's online documentation."
2,A Classic Orginally Published in 1919,"Be careful to make sure that this book is what you want. This is a new reprint of a book published in 1919 - and the print is antiquated and hard to read. If you want a classic this may be your book but if you want up todate info, it is not."
4,Not Your Average E-Book,This e-book is surprisingly thorough. It offers a wealth of well-reasoned and actionable information. Highly recommended for those who want to really become proficient at writing valuable feature articles.
1,You're got to be kidding. Right?,"Is this a joke? Unfortunately not. Mr. Liebert has a BS in Chemistry and an MBA in ""Marketing."" OOOOoooooo!(from where I wonder.) But apparently hat gives him enough background to professionally scam the ignorant and hoodwink the unsuspecting, but not much more. With credentials like that, I'm sure this guy knows far, far better than Smith, Hutton and over 200 years of scientific research and discovery in the field of geology. In reality, me thinks Mr. Liebert is desperately trying to work through the disconnects he's discovered between scientific REALITY and his musty, old book of Bronze/Iron age mythology."
4,Great Story that keeps you wanting more,"The second disc of Princess Nine is filled with more of the first disc. Ryo continues to search for enough people to fill out the roster. Izumi discovers that her mother has a connection with Ryos father and attempts to destroy the baseball team. And looming over the horizon, the first game!A very good story, the only problem is that it definetly ends the episodes on a cliffhanger. And since Amazon doesn't even have the 3rd disc available for preorder yet, this presents an issue. :-)Family oriented, no violence, language, nudity but a good story make this a well-rounded dvd."
5,Creative visualisation for kids by Jennifer Day - a must,This book is written to be used with children but adults love it too! The gentle but reviving imagery is carefully paced and succinctly put so that sessions can be guided properly to the level of childrens emotional and intellectual development. In other words kids don't get bored while you're reading to them. The book is full of practical exercises all very easily accessed with subjects to address particular problems for children. How about hanging up your troubles on the 'trouble tree' or discussing a difficulty you are experiencing at school with the 'professor tree'? I have so many favourites visualisations from this book and I return to read from it again and again. This is my must book for the new Millennium!
1,This is a kid's book!!,"I purchased this book based on the review of this book that someone else had left. Their review is of the wrong book. They are actually giving a review for a book called, ""The Collector."" So I just wanted to make sure that if you are looking at this book, that you know that it is a children's book."
4,Anti-Breakage Shampoo,"Everybody has a problem with split ends, especially if you dye your hair. I've been dying my hair for 3 or 4 years now, and my hair really needs some professional help to stay healthy. That's why I use TRESemme Vitamin B12 & Gelatin Anti-Breakage Shampoo, it's not expensive, only 4-5 bucks and easy to find in the local drugstore. I could get the same product by the professionals at the hairstyling place, but that would cost a fortune. The shampoo also prevent my hair from breakage and if you use TRESemme Vitamin B12& Gelatin Anti-Breakage Conditioner, you're doing your hair a big favor."
1,Saw no change.,"I saw no change in my hair after buying this product. For something that's so expensive, it should have me notice some change at least."
2,verbo defectivo...,"The translations of Sor Juana into English included here are the least inspired I have read, particularly of the more than 15+ versions of Sonnet 145 in existence, which this translator fails to engage even to ""write against"" them. In fact, these renditions read like artless trots for footnotes in an old Spanish language-learner's textbook, ignoring the last half-century of critical readings of them. (Make what arguments you like about a poet not being required to translate poetry.)Also, it is a discredit to the profession of translation to omit all mention of translation strategy in the introduction. To pretend that the English emerged fully formed is to de-emphasize the critical process involved in translation."
5,great BLUES DVD ...and guitar lessons!,"Unlike many DVD lessons which are merely video transfers this lesson features audiophile sound and fantastic image quality. Also during the lessons you can use the remote to view either his left or right hand closeups or full view....amazing! there are also bonus songs and the option to view the performance only!!! whether you want to watch this guitarist just play his tunes or get a wonderful lesson this DVD is the real deal ....oh and it is ALL REGION not region 1 as amazon states!!!songs included are: Slippin and Drippin, Lightnin Strikes, The Sick Boogie, If the Shoe Fits, Honky Tonk, Cascade Rag, West Coast Blues, C Rag Medley, and Blakes' Blast....this is traditional , funky acoustic blues at its best!!!"
4,Kenny Sultan did it for me,"I've dabbled with the guitar on and off for years but I never got beyond playing ""House of the Rising Sun"". I took live lessons for a while and tried lessons on CD but nothing really grabbed me until I bought Kenny Sultan's DVD. Being of beginner skill level I was intimidated by his songs at first but I liked his manner and presentation. Over the past year I'ver been able to translate 4 of his songs onto my own guitar ... which for me is quite an accomplishment. Kenny helped me discover that playing the guitar without years of traditional fingerpicking exercises is not impossible."
3,PDF's are inaccurate,"THe video is good. Control of the video is difficult. You can't easily get around within a lesson. Also the included PDF's are not accurate for what he is teaching, rendering them useless. Unless you want to slow this down to a crawl you won't have any idea what strings, frets he is playing,"
2,Guitar Blues,"I just bought this DVD thinking that the tab would be included, it isn't. If you want the tab for this DVD. You have to buy the book, plus CD.I'm really dissappointed. I have bought another DVD from this DVD compony, 101 Blues Guitar Essentials, Doug MacLeod, and the tab was included on the DVD.Now I just think a little less of Kenny Sultan."
2,"Wish I'd read the ""flounders"" review from ""a reader"" first!","Well, I simply cannot finish this book - it's so boring and slow moving that I cannot bring myself to carry on any further. The hero is immature (at 30 he really ought to be a bit more of a man and not chafing under his daddy's thumb!) and the heroine really is off-putting and unlikeable to the point that I just can't empathise at all! So, sorry, this one is going to the charity bookshop forthwith!A big disappointment!"
1,Misspelling on engraving = disappointed,I had an engraving done for this mug. I had to contact them a week after I purchased the mug as they had not contacted me by then. When the mug arrived (it was a bday gift and was sent to a friend) it had the incorrect spelling on it. After several attempts to contact them they finally agreed to send a new mug. I am very dissatisfied with their service & would not recommend them at all!
3,O.k.,"I had seen the ads for this game, and I was a Tony Hawk game fan so I went out and got this. The graphics were o.k. but the thing was that it's not like the THUG games because it has no story line. It's like just free skate the entire game. If you are a THUG fan I doubt you wil be satisfied with this game. It's your choice. And one last thing: the commercials make it look MUCH better than it is."
3,"Glitchy, glitchy.........................but fun.","Overall I think this is a fun game, which may or may not piss you off frequently. I have to agree with many of the other reviewers who claim this game is glitchy. This is VERY true at least for this PS2 version. I now cannot count how many times I have had to restart the system because the game had froze. Maybe the PS3 version would better support this game, I don't know. To sum it up though, it is fun and time consuming and will be sure to keep you playing until you finally have to tear yourself away. (Unless of course it pisses you off first ;) My best advice would be to wait until it goes down in price if you just can't bear to spend X amount on a glitchy game"
1,Tony Hawks Project 8 (PS2),This is actually a really great game if you have it for XBox 360 or PS3 but for the PS2 version they past the game on to some other developers who gutted a lot of the games functions and gave you the bare essentials to play Tony Hawk in a not-so-fun way.No Manual Push (Auto Push Only)No Creat A SkateParkGraphics arent as goodBut if you don't care about any of that then you can get this game for under 10 bucks brand new that's about the only pro.
2,Unbelievable,"I can't believe all the hype about this game, I finally get it, and it's a huge dissapointment! Underground is 100x better.Here's the things I don't like about this game:The camera angle makes me freekin' sick to my stomach!Your skater goes WAY too fast.Graphics are worse than Underground.Goals are stupid.Areas are complicated and crowded.Creating a skater is saddening because it dosen't have nearly as much clothes, hair styles, and faces.Stick to Underground and don't waste your money."
2,Arg....,"I've been looking forward to project 8. I figured that they'd only improve on the series. Unfortanetly, this is not true. The create-a-skater is all but nonexistent, the animations are glitchy, and I went through more walls than I care to count. Even the skate shop is crap. There is virtually no point in the sponsors messages, they do no good. the only good thing they added was the movies to show where some of the gaps are. Easily the worst Tony Hawk game yet..."
2,Disapointment,"I hate this game. I don't see how everyone thinks this game is sooooo great. Everyone was talking about the graphics, they're not all that great. THUG 2 sucked, Wasteland was pretty kool, but this one sucks. I really didn't think it was all that fun, it didn't keep me playin it like THUG 1 and Wasteland. They need to stop tryin to make the Tony Hawk games like all overrated and hype them up when they suck like this one and thug 2 were. Underground 1 will always be the best I think, I don't think any Tony Hawk game can out do that."
2,BEWARE!,The Xbox 360 and PS3 (next-gen) versions are different from the current gen Xbox and PS2 versions. They are produced by a different developer and are RADICALLY different (ie: next gen - open ended... current gen - like Tony Hawk 1). Do NOT purchase this game.
3,false review and description,hey it's not missing the nail the trick mode. it does have it and people could get it for the 360 not the ps3. but it is seperated into levels and it doesn't look as good as the 360 (obviosly) the description says you can do the bail thing but you cant its telling the description for the next gen consoles and this game is produced or something by a different company shaba i think its alright though (im not really a kid too) dont know password
5,The Best EVER!,"This is the best game that I have ever played! I love it so much! I have not ever played a game with so much that you could do. All of the missions are fun, and sometimes surprising! I love it sooooo much. I reccomend it to anyone! There is nothing bad in it. Go play it!"
1,Terrible,"This is the most challenging game i have ever played. Impossible to beat, and just frustrating, I dont recomend this to anyone!"
1,"This game sounds like ""Garbage"".","Wow! I jus cant believe this game at one point. It is awful and sucks. It has the worst graphics and most challenging goals I have ever played which I just can't do all this. This Tony Hawk game is even more worse than American Wasteland. Why are his video games getting harder and harder??? The only Tony hawk game I have ever loved was Pro Skater 3 which is the easiest and best graphic game I have ever played. Stay away from this, get Pro Skater 3 insted."
4,"Interesting topic, but not enough detail.","""Freedom's Wings: Corey's Diary, Kentucky to Ohio, 1857"" was a little bland, but for the age this series is aimed for, it's decent. There isn't enough detail of life at the plantation, the escape, and the new home in Canada, but it's interesting to see how Corey's grammar and spelling progressed over time. This book is great for the younger fans of historical fictions, but is somewhat of a let down for the older readers. I ""sorta"" recommend."
5,A young boy's diary of his journey from slavery to freedom.,"Nine-year-old Corey and his parents live in slavery on a Kentucky farm in 1857. But Corey has one thing most slaves don't have - his father, who was educated, has taught him to read and write, and to practice, Corey keeps a diary. When his father learns he is to be sold, he runs away, fleeing for the North. Corey and his pregnant mother soon follow, facing great danger because they hope to be able to live in freedom. Will Corey's family ever be reunited in freedom - or will they be separated and returned to slavery? Told through the form of Corey's journal, this book reveals what it was like for slaves who dared to escape bondage and made the dangerous journey along the Underground Railroad. I highly reccomend this book to all readers of the My America series."
4,Cant Wait to Read #2!,"My 6 yr old (2nd grade)loved this book. I picked it out for him at the library, and he wasn't very interested at first. But once he started reading, he couldn't put it down! He finished the book in 2 days! The misspelling & grammar errors were a little confusing to him, but it gave me a chance to explain that slave children didn't get to attend school, they were put to work, even children his age. It opened up a good discussion about being thankful to God for our freedom and the opportunities that we have. We are excited to discover this series, and to see the other cultural backgrounds brought out in the other books."
1,no show,"I ordered ""Chains of Destruction"" by Selina Rosen on 11-4-09. I haven't received it yet as of today 12-07-09. I have e-mailed them and asked for a refund....no response. I will not order from Smokey Mtn. Books again. John"

4,Double documentary....,"This disc contains two documentaries:- The first is a 58 minute 1994 documentary on Nostradamus himself and interpretations of his prophecies, containing various quality newsreel footages of his 'hits and misses'. The second documentary is from The Nine channel Australia and lasts a very interesting 87 minutes, with an excellant commentary on prophets and visionaries over the past few centuries and their ""insights, predictions, warnings and hopes for the future"". Both are very engrossing and entertaining, and are an excellant addition to any video documntary library. I gave four stars as the Nostradamus video picture quality is somewhat lacking - although the material covered more than makes up for this."
5,Hap Palmer's Rhythms on Parade CD,"I became acquainted with Hap Palmer when I taught Pre-school many years ago. I am a grandmother now, and ordered several of the CD's. I love them all! When the grandchildren visit we sing and dance, creating the best memories. Little do they know that they are learning while we are having so much fun!"
2,Did not see any secrets in this book,"Like many, I truly enjoy finding the perfect gift for someone and I was in hopes I would get some new ideas from this book, but that didnt happen. Well, maybe one I've never thought about giving someone ""Porsche driving shoes"" because having these shoes seem to be the next best thing to buying a Porsche. I mean, really?"
4,The answer to my prayers,"As the owner of a lifestyle and entertainment public relations firm, finding gifts for my unique clientele can be challenging. Fabulous Gifts makes my job a lot easier and I was surprised to discover how creative the gift-giving process can be.This is the perfect book written by a trusted and noteworthy expert in the field.Fabulous Gifts is also ideal for that family member that never seems to give you the ""right"" present."
1,Gretlund has no sense of place,This book with its poor selection of no names who offer their limited or non-existent wisdom on Welty should have never been published. It is further proof of the poor quality of USC Press Books these days.
1,Miss Welty deserves better,Miss Welty deserves more than this edited (if you can call it that) volume by this European who obviously believes that being able to wipe barbecue off on his sleeve means he understands the South and Southern writing. PLEASE.
1,Warning!!!,I got this ebook for free for my Kindle. I started reading the book and itended abruptly. It appears that it was copied from the original magazine serialand apparently ends at the end of the first installment of the serial. My bookended just as the hero arrives on Palos. Very disappointing. I wish now thatI hadn't sold my hardcopy of the book.
5,I became comfortable investing over the Internet,"Investing Online for Dummies helped me through the process of investing on the Internet for the first time. It was very thorough, and yet I still felt comfortable trying out her suggestions. I found the section on being aware of online fraud especially useful."
1,this book is garbage,"i had to rate this book one star because there was no ""ZERO""! This book is complete garbage and the worst investment you can make to start your investment career. There are other books on investing in this series, which do an incredible job for beginners. Even the resource center at any decent online broker has better information for you than this book has and the links won't go bad!"
1,You don't have to buy this.,"I came here to write a review for this book, and found that a reviewer below, ""A reader"", had already written what I was going to write. This book provides a reader with no information, but with long lists of websites to look at. You can access those websites most often just wasting time (like ""A reader"" already said). Using search engines like Google/Yahoo is much better than thumbing through this book."
1,Nothing but a list of bookmarks,"This book was like a video that you rent, but turn off after 15 minutes because the movie isn't worth finishing. It looks like the author used an Internet search engine to collect a large number of web sites, and then used the long list of links (1000's of them, or so it seems) to fill as many pages in the book as possible. However, they're empty pages, devoid of useful information. The author didn't even bother to highlight the 10-20 best sites, so that I wouldn't have to overload myself by trying to check out each one of the many sites listed.I already know how to use the Internet, but I'm a beginning investor. I was looking for something that would teach me useful techniques for finding the best stocks. If you are new to the Internet and don't know what to type in your web browser, then this book might be ok for you. If you are already comfortable with using a search engine, save yourself a few bucks and go to Google instead of buying this book."
3,Helpful . . . for dummies.,"The book is fine, if you really know nothing about investing. Fortunately, or unfortunately for me I knew a little something something, so it was only marginally helpful. But whatever.Actually, if you're new to investing, I can't see someone being without this book. It's potentially very helpful and could save you a couple of bucks. Although, in this market, it's a little bit too late."
5,A classic mystery,"If you've ever been to any of the old-time lake cabins in Minnesota, you'll feel like your there again when you read this classic 1940's mystery. The characters are perfect, and the setting, right down to the dirt and gravel paths to the lake, is so real you can almost see it. All Seeley's books have a real distinct 40's feel to them, so if you enjoy that, I'd say they're well worth your time."
3,not totally uncensored,This is not totally uncensored. It censors most of the naked genitals. The few naked genitals they do show which is about three are not very clear & none are male. It does show uncensored naked rears of both sexes & quite a few uncensored naked breasts. All the other footage is uncensored except for the f word. There are a lot of stunts that go badly & angry people also people that do stupid or gross things. It is ok but not worth much.
2,Dumb stuff,"This was disapointing. A bunch low quality clips that are drowned in commentary,dumb sound effects, fake sounds and music. Many clips are shown many times, often in a ''short'' montage of what you are going to see(wich is also shown many times). There are some interesting clips but not much information is given about the clip. I am pretty shure most of the black and white footage on this is fake, you can for example see the same person in two different clips, two very different incidents filmed in the same place and a clip that is shown twice but the second time it is shown the commentator has a different story on the clip.I would not recomend it."
2,Mediocre,"A lot of what needs to be said has been said. Saberhagen had a great concept for the Swords, one that he executed adequately if not brilliantly.His own story opens the book well, and ""Woundhealer"" is an excellent tale, concentrating on family dynamics and using its Sword in an appropriate way - as a way of developing the characters.The other stories are of variable to weak interest. Most are fairly poorly written, surprisingly so, for what should be a first-rank anthology. ""Luck of the Draw"" and the one about the quest for Farslayer are particularly poor - ok concepts but florid overwriting.""Stealth and the Lady"", ""Fealty"" both have elements of interest.""Dragon Debt"" - is just weird."
2,Light weight.,Poor quality basket I'll be lucky to get a couple of months use out of it. I would recommend spending a little more and get something with better quality.
2,Brady is Bunched,"I'm afraid to say Paul Bradys new cd is dissapointing.The only track that is any way lively is Love In A Bubble.This would never compare to the superb Hard Station.Brady has lost that Irishness,mabye it's from hanging with the superstars,they've rubbed off on him or something.I just wasted 20 euros I'm afraid to say.It's a boring offering.Iv'e listened to it in my car stereo for about 7-8 times and it just doesn't do anything for me.Buy the Best Of it would be a better option."
5,The Best Perfume Ever!,"This is the only perfume I've ever loved so much. It was my signature perfume then it was discontinued. There is absolutely no other like it. I've searched high and low. I've called Versace. No luck at all. All I've been able to do is get it on Amazon or another auction site. One time I received a bad bottle because, of course, it was old; refund was given after I had to pay shipping but the other bottle was good. I'll have to try to continue to find that ""one"" again. Until then, I can only hope they bring this back. Also, it's the only perfume that does not give me a headache and I always got compliments when I wore it. It lasts and lingers on your skin, in a good way."
2,Tasteless,"If you come over, you can have this woeful, tasteless junk-my terriers wouldn't touch it, and they'll eat bugs!"
3,Where's the beef?,"I am glad this product already got two good reviews, because that will balance out what I am going to say. ""WHERE'S THE BEEF?"" (Does anyone remember that burger commercial.....maybe I am getting old.) Maybe I need to say, for this product, ""where's the BEADS?"" Sorry, but 5 or 6 little beads per face-wash is not my idea of an exfoliant, so I feel deceived that this was specifically labeled and promoted as an exfolient. The cream is a bit thick and hard to wash off. Otherwise, it is a fine face-wash and I will be using it for good long time since my mother sent me 2 big tubes of it, not knowing that I had already bought one, so now I have 3. I will alternate with a 'real' exfolient once a week, such as Nivea/Visage Gentle Cleansing Cream."
3,Fat Albert,"To me, this was a sweet movie with some cute portrayals of the show I remember from years ago. Nothing earth shattering, but rather fun and something the kids can enjoy."
5,A good time for kids and grown ups,"For anybody criticizing this movie because it's ""unrealistic,"" remember it's based on a CARTOON! And for all the criticism about not having character development, it is NOT a documentary. (And how much did we really know or need to know about the characters -- cartoon and movie -- anyway, other than we liked them?) This movie was fun and sweet for me, and I remember Fat Albert from Saturday mornings in the 70s/80s, and for my five-year-old daughter. Just like a lot of family movies today, there were times when we were laughing at completely different things, and that's good. This movie is not going to change anyone's life, and as long as you know that, you'll ""get it."""
1,Bill Cosby must not have had an active role in this,I think there should be a competition on fear factor to see how many times someone could watch this movie. It's so dumb. Every corny comedy cliche about a person from the past who comes to the future is hit in this travesty. You could have more fun by throwing yourself down the stairs of your house.
5,grrreat,Grrreat condition my kids n i love this film! The animated fat albert is good as well it brings back child hood memories. Would highly recomend this company.
5,Arrived as promised in new condition.,The product arrived as promised in new condition and actually ahead of schedule. I am very pleased that I purchased this video online. I will be less afraid to purchase items in the future in this manner.
1,FAT ALBERT= FAT PIECE OF CRAPPOLA,"This movie was horrible to say the least. Save your money, and buy the old cartoons, which were recently released in DVD boxed set collections. THEY are worth it. Not this piece of sh** film, with HORRIBLE actors. The movie was boring and its attempt at comedy fails BIG TIME. The actor that plays Fat Albert sucks, as well as the rest of the cast."
2,Not too pleasing,"The movie had so much potential, but fails in a lot of ways. The movie relies on the same jokes about people from one decade in a present day world. We've seen the same before. Also the cartoon segments try to take an old cartoon and revive it, but all fails."
2,Wow Really Really Unfunny And Bad,"Yea im Not the type to bash films or anyhting but this is one horrible movie, I literally Didnt laugh Once, DOnt get me Worng i wanted to but It was just couldnt, Stear Far away form this one mayb for kids Under the age of 5, If ur any older than that your just insulting yourself to even think of watching this crapfest, Latazzz"
2,A sugar-coated Hollywood Money Maker $$$$,"The cartoon character Fat Albert is totally different from this character. When did a hot female ever hang out with Fat Albert anyway? NEVER! This is fine for kids under 13, but a 30-something like myself, awful. This is just typical ""we have no new ideas in Hollywood, so we'll made a stupid and predictable cartoon-to-live-action-movie piece of crap"". This is made totally for kids and parents that will tolerate watching it. Family fare.. possibly, but I warn those who dig my reviews! Until Then Folks..."
1,FAT ALBERT IS HOT AIR,"This is 1 of the most horrible movies that I have ever seen. I couldn't even get to the end of it before I got up to come and write this review. The actors in the movie need to hone their skills and stop trying to make movies to fit everyone. I don't know if they realize it but this movie is STRICTLY for the kids because they do not know any better. If I could have given this movie ZERO stars, I would have done so."
5,Hey Hey Hey!,"Fat Albert is an excellent movie, possibly the best non-animated one for kids. There's no adult language or sexual overtones, unlike many PG-rated movies nowadays. The cast and plot are great, and though there are a few sappy moments, it's entertaining, and the music is better than you would expect. This is a decent movie for adults, and a great movie for kids!"
4,Funny and with a Big Fat Heart,"This movie could easily have been very dumb, but instead it is sweet and silly. A high school girl's tears allow Fat Albert and the gang to jump out of the TV and into the Real World to ""help her with her problem"". Stuck in the 70s into which they were written, they aren't familar with the modern world of cell phones and laptops, and to the girl's embarrassment, they employ their simplistic TV sitcom ways to try to help her, like going up to kids and telling them that she doesn't have any friends, so they should be friends with her.The gang knows that they are cartoon characters come to life, and they begin to enjoy being out of the TV, only to discover that they need to get back in. It's a clever, cute story, great to watch with kids, and with no swearing, sexuality or other objectionable materials. And, of course, there's a good message."
4,Got it for my son!,He really enjoyed it and said it was funny! He said give it 4 stars mom!! We will rent again soon.
3,the fat albert movie,"Fat Alberti watched the fat albert movie and i must say i enjoyed watching the cartoon series better,this movie tries too hard to be like the animated series. its too obvious that keenan thompson is in a fat suit. some of the story messages are on point but is better left in animated series but it is family oriented"
5,Good movie !,"Got movie for a friend , she loved it , so I guess it pretty good !Didnt purchase for myself.But for a couple dollars , was worth it to make her happy !"
3,NOT MADE IN ENGLAND,"Over the last few years several English ceramics companies have shifted production eastward. Here are just a few:CHURCHILL CERAMICSJOHNSON BROTHERSSADLERROYAL ALBERTCHATSFORDIf you insist on English MADE ceramics and are not sure, inquire, or shop elsewhere. I too tend to shy away from teaware--porcelain & bone china--made in China or other countries--ESPECIALLY when I am looking for items Made in England. Sometimes an item may say ""DESIGNED"" in England, or ""MANUFACTURED OF ENGLISH DESIGN"". These are not Made or Manufacted in England. There are some really fine China based producers of ceramics, but what I despise is any attempt to mislead the consumer. When no country of origin is listed, I usually assume that item is NOT made in England. I hope this helps!"
5,Beautiful,This is a beautiful addition to your Churchill Brook Pink China set.It's a nice size and adds charm & elegance to tea time.You can't beat Amazon's price!
5,Every teacher should read this book.,"When I became a teacher, my uncle gave me his copy of this book. He said it was a wonderful novel and I would take pleasure in it. He was so right! Delderfield makes PJ, Bamfylde and the whole crew come to life in my imagination. I have been even luckier to have gained access to the wonderful Masterpiece Theatre rendition of it as well. If anyone lives near either the LA or NY site of the Museum of TV and Radio, you can see the miniseries, too! It is 13 hours long but well worth it."
3,Light and darkness,"After years in prison, a professional thief who was despoiled by his unfaithful wife seeks bloody revenge.For him, stealing is a legal act, because it relieves the exploiters partly of their culpability.This book hovers on the brink of unlikelihood (choosing the wrong victim) and navigates on exaggerated emotions.It doesn't have the high standard of other books of Mahfouz, like `Miramar' or `The journey of Ibn Fattouma.'Only for Mahfouz fans."
1,No Use for the Historical Costumer,"This book is not very useful to the historical costumer or those interested in costume history. Rather than paintings or drawings of clothing from their own time periods, it consists of redrawings in a Victorian style, thus distorting the historic lines.It might be useful to theatrical costumers, Victorian recreationists or those interested in the history of costume interpretation or illustration. But it does not give accurate representations of the garments illustrated, so if you want to make historical garments, get books with pictures that are actually from the time periods of the clothing you're interested in."
2,A 19th Century view of the history of fashion,"This book is valuable in it's position as a 19th Century-written book on the history of fashion. For this reason, it would be invaluable to anybody researching the attitudes of the 19th Century.However, for anybody wanting to research fashion it is of use only as a pretty oddity.It is fun to look through - the coloured plates are beautiful. Some of them are quite detailed and can give a very good idea of the fashion, but it is necessary for you to do more research before accepting this as gospel."
3,misleading,"The content of this book is great, but the size of the book is ridiculous. When they say a little style book, they mean literally a little book. Yes, the book has style, but who want to look at a 4"" x 4"" book on style or decorating? Too much money for such a book."
2,"Should be titled ""Simple Strategic Planning""","This book is very poor and I would recommend against purchasing it. This guide is seems to be written by seminar teachers, full of simple one-liners and cheesy analogies that don't really add that much to your understanding of strategy. Possibly a starter guide, but not recommended if you have already read anything on strategy."
1,Never delivered,Can't comment on product. Never received. Same address as everything else we receive. Have contacted vendor and will deny payment if not received.
3,Red Bedskirt,"This bed skirt is fine -- serviceable would be a word that comes to mind. I bought it for my 2 yr old sons room, so I wasn't looking for anything fancy, or expensive, so this fit the bill. There was some stitching that was off, or threads that were garbled, but all in all it works out just fine. I like the color with the quilt that we have."
5,Great nuts!,"I'm a huge nut fan and have tried many varieties. Living Intentions are the tastiest I've found and I like that they're raw. The Maple is one of my favorites, but the Chipotle are a very close second."
4,Deer Stags Loafer - a great buy for a nice loafer,"My recommendation is to go ahead and buy these if you need a nice, everyday, comfortable dress shoe. The price I paid was more than ""a good deal."" I was hesitant because I thought - this is to good to be true. I went ahead anyway, and selected the no-charge-to-ship method of receiving them. The shoes delivered within 5 working days and I am completely happy with my purchase."
4,Very comfortable dress shoe,"These are great shoes that are far more comfortable than wing tips. I go through a pair of them about every 8 months wearing them nearly every day. I love that you can slip it on and don;t have to bother with laces. The shoe won't hold up to extreme conditions, but it is great for office wear or dancing."
3,Comfy but not strurdy enough,"My husband has wide feet and he said they are comfortable; however, he is concerned that they won't last for long."
2,Too Long,Oh my gosh! This book was way too long and drawn out! She was ridiculously descriptive and the book went on forever when it really didn't need to. I saw this author on the Africa Channel talking about this book and decided to support her. I really wanted to read a book about Africans as the main characters and not a bunch of Europeans. I can find that anywhere. Not happy.
3,Intriguing premise is given comical treatment.,"Eric Roberts is a comic book artist searching for a missing woman who he last saw placed in an ambulance. Intriguing premise from Larry Cohen is actually played for laughs more than anything else. Thankfully, once you get in the mood for it, it's pretty funny. The story slows down too often to create quirky characters, but when it moves, it's fitfully entertaining. Roberts is a lot of fun in the lead role."
2,stupid disgusting gore,"I don't think any of the reviews done by these youngsters reflect what horror is all about! If this movie scared you like movies like the original Omen movie and others like that, you are silly. I't wasn't that bad if you just like alot of gore. I read reviews on this site thinking this might be a Scary movie. I was not satisfied. I like Joe D. but he should stick to erotic movies, those are awesome. This was just gore nothing more."
1,Just boring,"I have been collecting giallo and Italian/Euro horror for the past year. Having bought the great ones by Argento and Fulci etc I started to simply buy whatever fell into that category. This was one of them. I can only describe this movie as the bottom of the barrel. It tries to shock you and sets up with scenes or necophilia etc but they are just laughably bad and campy. There is no plot, except to string up these boring and idiotic attempts at shock. The funny thing is to listen to the actors and production people on the DVD. Usually you expect to hear them say how great the movie was, what a great expierence blah blah blah. Instead they are embarassed by the movie."
4,bizzare love triangle,"This is one of the best italian horror movies made.It ranks up there with Fulci's Zombi 2, and Deodato's Cannibal Holocaust.It's a strange and wicked story of love, and madness. It's got gore. Some of the most brutal, and volent scenes i've ever witnessed are from this movie. This should be in every horror fans collection."
4,A very gruesome horror film.,"I remember seeing this film in the video store as kid under the title ""Buried Alive.""It would be a decade before I ever got to see the film, but the cover art has always stuck with me. This is one of the better Shriek Show release. It's a very grim film with exceptional SFX that'll have you wondering if an actual corpse was used in the film.It's about a taxidermist who loses his girlfriend, he decides to keep her memory alive buy digging her up and keeping her around the house. Anyone that comes close to discovering his secret is taken out of the picture.Great acting, great gore, and a very memorable story. Goblin seals the deal with their perfect eerie score.This is one not to be missed!"
2,BLU-RAY IN WORSE SHAPE THAN DVD INCLUDED,"in the SAME PACKAGE, which is the same as the previous DVD release. I will be EXTRA CAREFUL when upgrading my favoritefilms to BLU_RAY from now on,because a lot of these I really can't see very much difference at all between these brand newBLU_RAY editions and the brand new 2 disc special editions i've purchased in the last 5 years, especially when played in a BLU_RAY!"
3,Better than I expected,"I was really suprised that I liked this film, I was expecting to stop watching it either because it was too violent or too stupid. However, I made it all the way through and I am going to add this film to my permanent DVD collection. There were some gory moments, but nothing TOO extreme. What I felt was way more impressive is how atmospheric this film was, especially in a living room setting. The musical score by Goblin was excellent and really gives this film a nice kick to it. Dare I say I found this film 'entertaining' despite it's icky subject matter? Absolutely!"
3,Strangely compelling.....,"Nowhere near as disgusting as everyone says. Gore/torture/grossness scenes are interspersed throughout what really is a sort of love story. There is no actual sex with a corpse, either. The dubbing is annoying. The music is great. I like the actor who plays Frank, he doesn't *look* like a sleezebag... There's some weird stuff in this movie and I had to watch it a few times to get the ending which seems abrupt. All in all I'm glad i bought a copy of this movie but I don't watch it much."
2,"So-So look at Reagan, lacks depth","The book is just over 200 pages of text, so detail is obviously lacking. In addition some statements/ideas are repeated verbatim, as if I didn't get the point. If you are somewhat interested in the 80's or Reagan this is a decent starting point. Think of it as the Cliff Notes on Reagan."
2,Flawed thesis.,"The author only gives credit to Reagan for restoring America's pride. He also presents the same myth about ""mortgaging our future"" with the national debt. Hey historians, if we've mortgaged our future, why is the economy so strong today? If you make 50,000 with 5,000 in debt, are you better off making 500,000 with 25,000 in debt?"
2,Blowing the covers off the Reagan presidency,"After reading this book, I was left to wonder: What did RR really do while president? The book is written from the middle, but with an emphasis toward the positive aspects of RR's presidency, with small amounts of negativity thrown in for balance. The book doesn't talk much about any one subject. A good quick primer on this mediocre president who will go down in history as one of the most divisive, deceptive presidents of our country."
3,typo in book,"There is a typo in the book that says Mary, mother of Jesus, is the daughter of Elizabeth, instead of Anne. Elizabeth was Mary's cousin. Other than that the book is pretty good, although now I'm wondering what else is a typo in the book that I just haven't noticed because I'm not knowledgeable on all the information talked about."
5,Being there,"I agree with the other reviewers that Paul Watkins is possibly our best living author. The research he did for Promise of Light shines through to set the reader in Ireland in the early 1920s (in fact, I think I remember reading that he lived in the town for a while, and would walk in the fields wearing the old boots his characters wore, so he would know exactly how it would feel and sound to be there).Watkins' strengths are in place and in ruggedly male characters; characters the reader connects with, without feeling all warm and fuzzy about it.The Promise of Light may be my favorite of Watkins' books, but it is right up there with Stand Before Your God and Archangel... both dealing with subjects I didn't know I was interested in until his writing drew me into them. I whole-heartedly recommend any of these."
5,correlative and interpretative echo.reporting,"the most important part of echocardiography is the accompanying report. no amount of color photos and doppler tracings can compensate for a poorly written report. reports have to be written disease wise from management and prognosis point of views. different diseases merit different reports. this book is all about how to write correlative and interpretative reports for varying cardiac conditions. thus anyone wishing to master this art of reporting, this small book is a must."
2,Uncertain about its authority,"The author writes with authority and describes the methodology for creating the treatments, but in several instances I found his descriptions of the uses of the remedies to be very different and even opposite to the indications in the traditional Boericke repertory.Materia Medica by Boericke"
2,2 stars for too small,"I bought this for a father's day present. It says one size for men, and when I recieved the apron it looked more like a children's apron than for a man. The loop for the head was so tiny my niece who is 16 couldn't get it over her head. Very dissappointing."
2,Disappointing - and dumb,"I bought this book because the Washington Post Book Review recommended it. It read more like a teenage novel. The protagonist, Nella, is prone to giving speeches and speaking, especially early on, as no other fifteen-year old girl would do. I found it hard to believe the other characters would sit still long enough to listen to her.The last third of the novel zips through the second half of her life, and I felt like I was reading the Thornbirds. Light reading? You bet! Ultra-light."
4,Trigiani does it again!,"Adriana Trigiani has a way of drawing readers into her stories of Italian-Americans and making them feel like one of the family. This book starts out slowly but gains momentum as the reader follows the life and dreams of Nella Caselluca. Nella puts up with the bullying of her older sister and life on a farm which she does not enjoy in order to achieve her dream of becoming a teacher. Her family supports her in this, until a near-tragedy derails her plans. She goes to work in a blouse factory in order to help her family through a difficult time. In the midst of this turmoil she meets the handsome Renato whose relationship with Nella is woven throughout the book. Nella is stubborn and independent and it takes her a long time to realize what real love is all about. Some of the plot lines seem somewhat contrived, but Trigiani's ability to touch the reader's emotions and create endearing characters is undiminished in this book."
4,The Queen of the Big Time,"I really enjoyed this book! The characters and their life stories were fascinating and very well written. For my taste the two of Trigiani's books that I've read end with a bit too much sentimentality, but of course some people may like that."
4,Loved this Book!,"This was a delightful well written book about Italian immigrants who settle in Pa. A product of immigrants, I related to the hard working families and the values they instilled in their children. This book was funny and emotional. At times, however, I felt that the author could have expounded more on certain issues and events. However this lack of detail did not affect the story in a negative way. It was great and well worth reading."
4,Revisiting my childhood,"I took a journey back in time. We too celebrate crowning Our Lady of Mt Carmel. I felt like I was living with the characters. Story is well written, enjoyable and fast reading. A treat."
5,Excellent Italian American Story,I loved this book. As an Italian - American I enjoyed many of the references. This is a heartwarming story about a girl from age 13 through her 60. It includes the whole family which brought back memories of my childhood. It is told in a simple funny way that made me an Adriana Trigiani fan for life. If you like this one try Lucia Lucia. It is just as interesting.
4,Heartwarming story,"Really enjoyed this book, went by too fast. Very heartwarming, with the ups and downs of life as it was long ago and family closeness. I can't wait to read more!! Also loved Lucia, Lucia, and will read all the rest as soon as I get my hands on them. Also includes recipes that I enjoy!If you enjoy going back to the days that were simpler in a way but harder also, you will enjoy this wonderful story."
5,Queen of writing!,"*SPOILER in REVIEW* Loved it! Another winner by Trigiani! I fell in love with these characters and their lives...hard lives. This book takes you from childhood to ultimately death of the main character Nella. The book moved along quickly but gave plenty of information so I didn't feel cheated. Nella has a hard life. I worried about Nella and her family. I just waited for her life to collapse. It didn't, Nella was a strong character, so strong in fact that the ending left me very sad. She came into my life as quickly as she left. I'd recommend this to any Trigiani book lover. It's ONE of her best!"
3,Good but not great.,"I read this book several months after reading Rob Mundle's ""Fatal Storm"" about the same Sydney-Hobart race, and felt that ""The Proving Ground"" lacked the emotional intensity and the ability to make you feel as if you were there on the boats with the sailors that the first book captured so well.I have done quite a bit of sailing offshore, and experienced conditions approaching the ones described in the book, and it was Mundle's story that brought back the sensations of this the most clearly, which is why his book rings the truest for me.That being said, ""The Proving Ground"" is still an excellent read, and goes on to cover some of the shore-based aftermath of the tragedy."
4,Great book of its' kind -men racing yachts,"The book is a true story of a 1998 race off the south of Australia. Somewhat a rich men and their expensive toy yachts story, and only a tiny bit about women. There was a lot of description of some of the people which got tiring, but the story was interesting. Many yachts were lost and people died due to a huge storm announced shortly after the race started. I've never read anything like it and would not have chosen it to read except that my book club was reading it. I did learn some things about people and Australia."
5,kept me up reading all night,"I'm a landlubber but I am fascinated by stories of humans under pressure. Here, the story of the 1998 Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race is brought to life in such detail that I could envision the life rafts being tossed by giant waves, the violent arguments between experienced veterans and novice sailors, and the anguish of grown men watching helplessly as friends drowned before their eyes and as other boats and aircraft passed them by. It's not a criticism to say I wanted to know more: why did Gibbo sue the man who saved his life, and why did Beaver commit suicide years after surviving 29 hours on a flimsy life raft? The author did a brilliant job of bringing everyone to life on these pages, making me care what happened to them."
4,Scared me to death!,"I love reading books about things that scare the crap out of me. Sailing is one of those things, so, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It gave me the heebie-jeebies just as much as The Perfect Storm did -- perhaps even more so, because I have actually been on sailboats many times and have never been on a commercial fishing vessel.The descriptions in this book of what was happening during the tragic 1998 Sydney-to-Hobart sailing race are clear and vivid. I really felt like I was on some of those boats and rafts (and it was NOT a good feeling!) I would have liked a bit more technical information about the weather system that resulted in the storm that caused the problems in this race, but what is included was interesting.I will never EVER be personally involved in a sailing race, but I sure like reading about them. Reading this book caused me to add several other books about ""sailing misadventures"" to my to-read list."
4,gripping story...,"The Proving Ground tells the story of the 1998 Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race which takes place every year in Australia. In 1998 a ferocious storm crippled many of the over 100 yachts entered in the race. This story is a gripping account culled from interviews with the sailors. The cast of characters ranges from Larry Ellison, founder of Oracle to Beaver a 19 year old sailing in his first Hobart. This race would change all their lives forever. It is a gripping, harrowing account of nature's fury versus man's quest for greatness. As always man is no match for nature and in their struggle to survive mammoth waves pounding their yachts. This is a moving story expertly told by G. Bruce Knecht."
4,"I don't know what it is, but I like it!","Usually classified under ""ska"", like many original and excellent groups, African Head Charge in reality defies classification.Not really African, certainly not ska. Very strange.""Songs of Praise"" is somewhat more mainstream than their other work, with a primitive-but-not-ethnic, loosely spiritual quality.Songs of Praise has a hauntingly atmospheric, gritty groove that sticks with you after the CD has played-out."
3,What kind of FZ fan are you?,"What kind of FZ fan are you?Completist?For the comedy?For the guitar work?For the amazing creativity?etcI'm a completist so I have it, it does not get played much but I love FZ. If your a causal fan or not sure if you want to take the orcehstral plunge with FZ I'd suggest go elsewhere first.Not bad, but I know I don't reach for it much.Yellow Shark or some of the orchestral stuff on lather (or orchestral favorites) are a nice place to start.But if you crave all of what Frank released you have to get it on that level it won't disapoint."
5,An HIstorical Must,This very early history of England is a surprise. It carries the reader into a time and place that is hardly familiar yet people by the familiar human family. Bede's writing - or this translation of his writing - is eminently readable and holds one's attention.
1,Bad information for this item.AMAZON WASTED MY MONEY,Just got available to install these wires after recovering from surgery AND THEY ARE THE WRONG ONES AND NOT RETURNABLE. A WASTE OF MONEY.THANKS AMAZON FOR WASTING MY MONEY.
3,NOT Made in England,"This dinnerware set is nice, but nothing more. It is wrongly described by ""Made in England"" when it is actually ""Made in Colombia"". Therefore, it is not the highest quality. When I received it I was a little bit disappointed. Unlike the real ""Made in England"" Churchill china, the color is faded, and the offprint is displaced a little. Altogether, not a bad deal but still looking for the real England made-there is A difference.Everything arrived well-packed, with no damage."
1,China,When I checked this item out I was given the impression that it was made in Britain. Since I had bought it as a gift I did not see it until a few months later when I visited the recipient. I was very shocked and dissapointed to see that it was made in Columbia not Britain!. I wish Amazon would state the origins of its products.
4,Very nice!,"I wasn't sure if I should purchase this set or not after reading the mixed reviews, but I am glad that I did. The china is not thin, the color is beautiful, and very shiny. They are packed extremely well. The only complaint I have is that there are places on the pieces that are rough as though the shiny finish was skipped. When running your hand around the edge of a saucer, for example, you feel a rough spot as though there was a chip. There are not many spots like this on my set, but worth mentioning if you are very particular. Even taking this in to account, I am very happy with my purchase. The set is very pretty and appears to be able to stand every day use."
3,good casual set,"Overall, I'm happy with the dishes. It is a pretty set which I use for casual dining, even entertaining. While there are minor differences in the color of a few, it doesn't bother me. I was surprised at the 'thinness' of the stoneware. I would have preferred that rather than cups & saucers, the set would have come with serving plates, etc. - but I knew what I was getting. Also, I find the bowls a little small."
5,Lovely dinner set,"This is an excellent dinner set. The design is great, especially the cups look so cute. It seems they are durable for longer time. It is a good selection for a kitchen or dining table to give a better look."
4,Works,Does the Job I just wish it came in a warming solution which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 stars.
4,Good product,Purchased this for use with at home fetal heart rate doppler. Feel that this is a great product for a good price. Very satisfied and would recommend this to others.
5,Parker Laboratories Aquasonic Ultrasound Gel 25 Liter,Nice to have a larger bottle of this and it works well. Recommned this quantity and company brand. Good product
1,Not 0.25 Liter,This product is mislabeled - or the seller sent the wrong size. I received two 0.06 liter tubes not 0.25 liter bottles.
1,Aquasonic bottle,"I ordered this product and it wasnt well packed , when I got it , it was on a yellow envolope with no security or sign that said fragil , and the tap was broken , so at the end , I didnt get anything.. :("
1,never received it,i still have yet to receive this item.. been waiting for over a month.. I paid for this item and should not have to try and track it down!
5,Good product,"This works well and doesn't dry out too fast.It went much further for the amount than I thought it would too[Aquasonic Ultrasound Gel .25 Dispenser Bottles, One Case of 12"
3,Badly designed bottle,"The gel itself works fine with my ultrasound therapy machine. However it's hard to get the gel out of the bottle, even when the bottle is full. You have to shake the bottle several times and squeeze hard."
2,Parker Laboratories Aquasonic Ultrasound Gel .25 Liter Bottle,"I an not too happy with this product because I have to keep reapplying gel to the area because it dries so quickly and besides when it dries, it becomes a sticky mess which is hard to clean off, both from the skin and the ultrasound unit itself."
5,Parker Labs Ultrasound Gel,"Bought this to replenish supply of gel that came with my portable ultrasound device. Positives: Evaporates slowly, lubricates for the full several minutes of ultrasound treatment, wipes off readily after use, no fragrance."
5,great for Sonic Relief,"I saw this in the ""customers also bought"" for the Sonic Relief ultrasound device, so since it was so cheap I bought some. The little 2.5oz, which Sonic Relief sells for $18, is THE SAME GEL as this 8.5oz that sells for less than $4.Also, interestingly, I found that if I mix 1 part Bengay with 1 part ultrasound gel, it seems to amplify the effects of the bengay! I found this out since I was using the sonic relief to heal the injury while using bengay to manage the pain; kind of a ""hey, you got peanut butter in my chocolate and hey, you got chocolate in my peanut butter"" Reeces type discovery. Anyway, this gel is cheaper than bengay, so cutting bengay with this will give you more bengay AND greater effects. Try it!"
5,Just plain great,I bought my wife a baby heart rate doppler but I forgot to buy the gel. I used lotion but it didn't work every well. This gel is great. Its what her Dr uses. the bottle was bigger then i thought and it has a nice baby power smell and wipes off clean without any stickiness or greasy look to it.
5,"Great Product, Fast Shipping!","I needed some replacement gel for my ultrasound doppler and couldn't find it locally. This works wonders and you don't even need a lot to hear the baby's heartbeat. Shipping was ridiculously fast. Overall very satisified with purchase, and would buy from in the future!"
4,great little camping knife,I loved this knife. It wasn't the greatest quality but it held up. I needed to tighten it every couple months but other than that it was great. I can't tell how long the blade lasted cause I had this while I was in Boy Scouts and I was incredibly hard on the blade but the hook on the back of the knife was great for both rope and gutting fish. The handle fit well in my large hands and made it just overall easy to handle. I definitely would recommend this knife to anyone needing an inexpensive knife.
5,A stimulating exercise of the mind,"It goes without saying that Fredric Brown is a master of the art when it comes to short stories, and if you love short short stories, the ones in this book are prime cut. The majority of these are 1 to 3 pages and nearly all have surprise endings. What amazes you most is how Brown can manage to top the story you just read, but a couple of stories later, it happens. Thought provoking to the max, his imagination seems to be completely unbound as you venture from one unbelievably profound situation to the next. How Brown manages to seize your total attention in 3 pages or less is a tribute to his craft of opening and perhaps even invading your thought process. I place this book on a pedestal of its own, a standout in the crowd. Read it, by all means, and at your own risk of becoming a deeper thinker."
1,Kai Touch n Brow Razors,"I love these razors and purchase them all the time. However, this order came with razors not packaged. Normally they come 3 razors in a sealed package. These razors came already opened leaving me wondering if they are new or refurbished. With the magnitude of blood diseases these days I don't want to risk using a razor that is not in a sealed package. I'm out $21.57 and very disappointed with this order."
2,not good for me,"i really didnt like it, just stick with the regular razor. too hard to shave for me, wouldn't recommend it myself."
5,Great Little Shavers,I was extremely pleased with these little shavers. They worked great around the eyebrows and upper lip and were very easy to handle. I had no issues with any nicks or scrapes. As with any razor you need to use care but as long as you go slow (and use some type of lather and not use on dry skin) you should be fine. I won't go back to using a regular razor which I have used in the past and did experience some nicks. Will definitely be ordering in the future as well as recommending them to my friends.
3,Be Careful!,"I used this to remove facial hair and my face is now in REALLY rough shape (to the point that I'm kind of freaking out because it's been 36 hours and it's getting worse, if anything. Probably because I wore a lot of mkae up tody to cover up the redness..)....I have red bumps, knicks, and painful irritation similar to, but worse than, razor burn on my face. I do not consider my skin to be sensitive and I did not push hard while going over my face and it did not cause pain until about 5 minutes after I was done. Even following the directions on how to remove stray eyebrows caused knicks and bleeding. I would not recommend this product for anything other than in between and right above brows. Even though the description says for brows and delicate neck area, I wouldn't use this on ANY delicate skin. I gave it 3 stars because it did effectively remove the hair from in between and right above my eyebrows effectively. Be careful if you intend to use this on more than that area."
5,Great!,"If you do at home dermaplanting, these are pretty handy. They do dull pretty quickly, but they last longer than other facial razors I've seen. And the price is pretty good too ;)"
5,Effective and safe on my skin,"The laser place where I used to go, uses these razors to touch up and prep the area before using the laser. The technician told me that these are the kind they use because they're so safe. And it seems very true-- the design is unique, having safe little ""bars"" that run across the blade, so that tiny mm-long gaps are left exposing the blade, just enough to cut the hairs, but not the skin. I feel totally safe using this in my bikini area or other sensitive areas, without fear of getting cut. The design is great. I was so impressed that I am about to purchase my second pack now. When I use it, I don't experience razor burn or negative stuff like that. No in-growns so far, either."
5,A complete reference book for microwave links design,"I am using the first edition of this book in my Telecommunication Engineering course. The author deserves my congratulations. This book is well organized, has clear explanations and makes an efficient compilation of the ITU-R recommendations, pointing precisely the relevant aspects when necessary. The book has also a practical focus, clearly showing real world and market experience, not only laboratory developed knowledge, still keeping well balanced level of math. This second edition certainly improves the already well-done work. I recommend it."
5,Great fit,"2005 Dodge Magnum RT.Fits great, only difference between the originals is that they seem a little fatter... About the same length"
3,An adequate remake of the true story of Brian and Gayle,"This version is an adequate retelling of the story of Brian Piccolo and Gale Sayers, and Piccolo's fight with cancer. When I saw it I was somewhat let down, since it seemed to lack the emotional punch and era realism of the 1971 original.I found the combination of Billy Dee Williams and James Caan to be a more believable and approachable duo than Sean Maher and Mekhi Phifer. Though the newer version is worth a look, I wouldn't run right out and buy it without seeing it first.In summary, this movie presents a good retelling, but, in my opinion, lacks the emotional punch and character development of the 1971 original."
